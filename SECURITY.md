# Security Policy

The Department of Veterans Affairs participates in a Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure Program through Bugcrowd. Please report any security-related issues using our [Bugcrowd program](https://bugcrowd.com/va-vdp).

If your Bugcrowd submission is related to an open GH issue, please include that issue ID in the description field of your disclosure. 

But, please do not open new security-related issues. If you are a developer and have concerns, you can reach out on our internal Slack channel #platform-security.
