- Clearer communication of data requirements and constraints

## Contents

Data dictionaries are organized by form number and include field definitions, data types, validation rules, and mapping information relevant to VBA form processing and automation.

## Usage

These dictionaries should be referenced when:
- Implementing or updating VBA forms on VA.gov
- Integrating with VBA downstream systems
- Coordinating with VBA Managed Service providers
- Documenting data flows and transformations
