ðŸš€ **Repository Performance Improvement Complete!**

We've successfully migrated large files to Git LFS, making our repository much faster for everyone! ðŸŽ‰

**âœ… Good news:**
- Repository clones are now ~2.5 GB smaller
- Much faster downloads for new team members
- Better handling of large files (PDFs, videos, documents)

**ðŸ”§ If you have an existing clone:**
You may see some "Invalid OID" warnings from `git lfs pull` - these are expected from the migration process and won't affect your work. 

**Quick fixes if needed:**
1. Try a fresh clone (it's much faster now!)
2. Or run: `rm -rf .git/lfs && git lfs install && git lfs pull`
3. See troubleshooting guide: `docs/lfs-migration-notice.md`

**For new team members:** Everything should just work seamlessly!

**Subject:** Repository Performance Upgrade - Git LFS Migration Complete

Hi team,

We've completed a major performance improvement to our shared repository! Large files (documents, videos, design files) are now managed through Git LFS, which provides these benefits:

**Immediate Benefits:**
- Repository downloads are now significantly smaller (~2.5 GB reduction)
- Faster clone times for new team members
- More efficient handling of large binary files
- Reduced bandwidth usage for everyone

**What You Might Experience:**
If you have an existing repository clone, you may encounter some temporary issues related to the migration:
- "Invalid OID" warnings during LFS operations (these are harmless)
- Files appearing as "modified" when you didn't change them

**Recommended Action:**
For the best experience, consider doing a fresh clone of the repository. It will be much faster than before and avoid any migration artifacts.

**Troubleshooting Resources:**
- Quick reference: `docs/git-lfs-quick-reference.md`
- Detailed guide: `docs/lfs-migration-notice.md`
- Team support: #platform-support channel

This improvement will benefit everyone's daily workflow. Thanks for your patience during the transition!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
