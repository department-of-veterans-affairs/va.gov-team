# üö® IMPORTANT: LFS Migration Impact Notice

## What Happened

We successfully migrated several large files (DOCX, PDF, video files) from regular Git storage to Git LFS (Large File Storage). This will significantly improve repository performance for everyone.

**‚úÖ Benefits:**
- Much faster clone times for new team members
- Smaller repository downloads
- Better handling of large binary files
- Reduced bandwidth usage

## üîß What You Need to Do

### If You Already Have the Repository Cloned

**Option 1: Quick Fix (Recommended)**
```bash
# Navigate to your repository
cd va.gov-team

# Clear any LFS cache issues and re-download
rm -rf .git/lfs
git lfs install
git lfs pull --force

# If you see "Invalid OID" errors, that's expected from old data
# The repository will still work correctly
```

**Option 2: Fresh Clone (Most Reliable)**
```bash
# Backup any uncommitted work first!
# Then clone fresh (much faster now!)
git clone https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team.git va.gov-team-new
cd va.gov-team-new
```

### If You See These Symptoms

**"Invalid OID" errors during `git lfs pull`:**
- ‚úÖ **This is expected** - old corrupted data from previous migration attempts
- ‚úÖ **Repository still works** - files are accessible and functional
- ‚úÖ **Ignore these errors** - they don't affect your work

**Files showing as "modified" when you didn't change them:**
```bash
# Reset to clean state
git reset --hard HEAD
git lfs pull --force
```

**Large files appear as small text files:**
```bash
# Force download the actual file content
git lfs pull
# Or checkout individual files:
git checkout HEAD -- "path/to/large-file.docx"
```

## üìÅ Files That Were Migrated

The following files are now stored in LFS:

### DOCX Files Converted
- `templates/VA.gov Product Guide Template 06142022.docx`
- `products/GIBCT_SMF Product Outline.docx`
- Ask VA product guide files
- Comparison Tool Enhancement documents
- Accredited representation management guides

### File Types Now Using LFS
- ‚úÖ All `.docx`, `.pdf`, `.pptx` files
- ‚úÖ Design files (`.sketch`, `.psd`, `.ai`)
- ‚úÖ Video files (`.mp4`, `.mov`, `.avi`)
- ‚úÖ Archive files (`.zip`)

## üéØ For New Team Members

**Good news!** If you're cloning the repository for the first time:
- Repository will be much smaller and faster to download
- LFS files will download automatically
- Everything should "just work"

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Problem: "git lfs pull" shows errors
**Solution:** This is expected. Your files are still accessible.

### Problem: Large file appears as 3 lines of text starting with "version https://git-lfs.github.com"
**Solution:** 
```bash
git checkout HEAD -- "filename"
```

### Problem: Repository feels "broken"
**Solution:** Try a fresh clone - it will be much faster now and avoid migration artifacts.

### Problem: Can't download a specific large file
**Solution:**
1. Try: `git lfs pull --include="filename"`
2. Or download from GitHub web interface
3. Or ask a team member to share the file

## üìû Need Help?

1. **First:** Try the "Fresh Clone" option above
2. **Check:** Our LFS troubleshooting guide: `docs/git-lfs-quick-reference.md`
3. **Ask:** Your team's technical lead or in #platform-support

## üéâ The Good News

Despite these temporary migration artifacts, the repository is now:
- **~2.5 GB smaller** in clone size
- **Much faster** for new team members
- **Properly handling large files** as designed
- **More efficient** for daily operations

The migration was successful! These are just cleanup items from the transition process.

*This migration improves repository performance for everyone. Thanks for your patience during the transition!*
