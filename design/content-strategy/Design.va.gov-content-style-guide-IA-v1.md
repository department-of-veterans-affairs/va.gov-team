## Consolidated VA.gov content style guide 

# design.va.gov

Working notes shown {like this}. 

Alpha for nav structure, except for the first 2 items (Content principles, which bascially acts like a landing page; and the Word list, because I think that will be the most looked for item by most comms managers and contract writers.)



## VA.gov content style guide

Content principles  {landing page for Content vertical of design.va.gov - SUPER short - plain language, conversational, human, va.gov}

Word list 

Abbreviations and acronyms

Buttons

Capitalization {I think this can be chunked up in the more granular items like Links, Buttons, so on; but it would be good to have a general section on capitalization here -- we currently use several different styles of capitalization depending on whether it's a breadcrumb label vs. page title vs. button. I'd like us to consider simplifying this to just one or at most 2 styles.}

Contractions

Dates, numbers

Links

Lists

Naming  {for us: naming programs, products, features}

Page titles and section titles

Phone numbers, time zones

Punctuation

SEO {or "Writing for SEO"? }

User interface elements {not sure this is the best label; what I mean is action/instructional microcopy for UI elements like using "select"/"check" for checkbox items, "choose" for dropdowns, NOT using "click" or "tap" -- although our vets.gov style guide calls for using "click" -- "download" for documents/forms/military records...}

VA forms

We, us, you

Web policies and directives {place to consolidate & link to most CURRENT stuff like 6102 stuff, Plain Language Act, 508 stuff?}
