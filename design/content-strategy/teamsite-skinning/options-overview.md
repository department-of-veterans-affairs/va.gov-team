# Overview of Options to Update Front-End of Existing VA.gov Pages / Teamsite Teamplates
August 2018

As part of the VA Web Brand Consolidation, we researched different options for updating the front-end look and feel of existing VA.gov pages to reflect the U.S. Web Design System (USWDS). The content and tools in the Veteran-Facing Tools tech stach, which will be integrated into VA.gov by November 2018, uses the USWDS, but the existing content and tools on VA.gov do not.

## Option 1: Only update the header/nav and footer on existing VA.gov pages
> **Recommended approach!**

### Pros:
- The minimum responsibility we have to users is that we provide a consistent navigation and wayfinding experience on VA.gov. User access to the same global haeader and footer on most pages of VA.gov provides this.
- This is not a large technical lift to implement.

### Cons:
- Users will be switching between "new" pages, layouts, and UI patterns using the USWDS and "old" pages, layouts, and UI patterns on VA.gov
- The experience has an inconsistent look and feel
