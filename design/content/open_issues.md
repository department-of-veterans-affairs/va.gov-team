# IA Open Issues

### Health Care
- [x] Health ID Card page - This page currently exists on VA.gov. Now that we are combining all ID cards into a single static page, do we still need this page that is specific to the Health ID Card.  https://www.va.gov/HEALTHBENEFITS/vhic/index.asp
  - _Decision: Main ID card page will link to this health care ID card page for further information and instructions. Keep page in IA._

- [x] Community Care - Microsite that includes a heavy amount of content that is not geared towards Veterans.  https://www.va.gov/communitycare/ Options:
  - _Decision: Link to this microsite from the HC hub page.  Do not make any changes to this site, URLs all stay the same. Clicking on option will take user out of HC hub. Link to the main page of Community Care site. Keep in left nav._
  
- [x] Scheduling/Viewing Appointments - What are all the different tools and where are they located?  There are static pages that talk about these tools on Vets, VA and MHV.  How can we simplify this experience?  What pages do we need to keep? 
  - _Decision: We will revise the current Vets page that will explain the two tools that are available. The page will include links to both tools and direct them through the login first.  The current MHV static page in front of the Scheduling tool will remain.  See solution here:  https://app.moqups.com/greg@adhocteam.us/Rnc4BDEKrA/view/page/aeddf88e9_
  
- [x] Health Records - Need to define all the tools/capabilities that should be included in this static page and where it should link to   - Download Records, Share Records, Access Health Summary, Medical images,  Lab and Test Results (crosslink), more?
  - _Decision: Confirm all options available on MHV, ensure 1 to 1 mapping of static pages to main options within MHV.  Crosslinking can be used as needed, but each page will have one main call to action into the appropriate area of MHV._
  
- [x] Order CPAP Machines, Hearing Aid Batteries and Prosthetic Socks - Do we list all three in the option or do we call it "Medical Equipment"? It is currently ranked as the 5th link for the top nav, and this is a long link for the top nav. However, "medical equipment" will likely not be as understandable.   
  - _Leave it as "Order Hearing Aid Batteries and Prosthetic Socks", determined we would not be handling CPAP equip at this time._

- [x] Wellness Programs - This is a grouping of pages from across the site and various sub-domains. There isn't landing or overview page for this contet. 
  - _Decision: Create a new static page that describes the various Wellness programs and links to the appropriate pages. The new page will live in the HC hub and link to the other pages.  No changes will be made to any other pages. The grouping can stay intact for the VHA hub._
  
- [x]	Health care “Special Groups” – Family, Caregivers, elderly, homeless, incarcerated, gulf war, Korean war, LGB, Minority, Native americans, POWs, Living overseas, Vietnam war, women, world war II
  - _Decision: Special groups will not be handled as part of first release.  Link to this content as needed, many will also be linked in the footer initially.  These will be part of future phase._
  
### Disability
- [x] Historic Rate pages - There are main rate pages for the differet types of compensation rates.  Each of them then link to historic rates, each year is a separate page.  Will we be updating the URLs of all of those historic rate pages as well?  The current year's rates live on the main page, how does this impact the process of moving the rates off the main page onto a historic/year page and posting the new rates?
  - _Link to pages as they are, not updating VA.gov URLs_

- [x] DBQ Microsite - There are a number of pages about the DBQ and process.  A few pages are not relatd to the Veteran, but most are.  https://www.benefits.va.gov/compensation/dbq_disabilityexams.asp  Options:
  - _Link to pages as they are, not updating VA.gov URLs_

- [x] Radiogenic Risk Activities page on VA.gov - Is this the same as our Radiation Exposure page, or do we need to consider this page in our Exposures area?  https://www.benefits.va.gov/COMPENSATION/claims-postservice-exposures-radiogenic_diseases.asp
  - _these are the same_

  
### Education
 - [x] Apply Now Wizard - The current Vets site has a "wizard" that directs users to the correct application.  In the new IA there are contextual links that take users straight to specific forms and bypass the wizard.  Need to discuss this change with SMEs to determine any technical needs or UX challenges. 
   - _To ensure we do not risk more users selecting the wrong form, we will continue to follow the current experience where the How to Apply and Apply Now links both lead to the the How to Apply page to push users throught the wizard and ensure they are directed to the right form.  For the forms nested under Family, National Call to Service and Make Changes, Danielle and Mikki will review content to ensure that users are clearly vetted before they ove forward on those forms - if we don't feel we can make it clear enough, we will reroute through the How to Apply wizard.  We will also review the Transfer page to ensure users continue in the correct direction._
 
 - [x] Yellow Ribbon Participating SChools pages - There is a page for each year and under each year there is a page for each state that is participating for that year.  Will we be impacting the URLs for these pages as part of MVP or should they remain as they are?  If they remain, the user will leave the Education hub when they click on a link. 
   - _Link to pages as they are, not updating VA.gov URLs_
 
 - [ ] WAVE Web Automated Verification of Enrollment - Is this redundant to checking your GI Bill benefit status, or is this a different task that should be included in Manage spoke? https://www.gibill.va.gov/wave/index.do
   - _ask during VBA SME meeting_
 
 - [x] My Story Microsite - Do we move (i.e. change URL) this content into the Education hub? https://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/my_story.asp
   - _Link to pages as they are, not updating VA.gov URLs_
 
 - [ ] Colmery Opt-out Form - This form is launching on Vets.gov on Aug 1, it will not have high visiblity and stakeholders are not pushing traffic to it due to it not being very beneficial to the veteran.  In the new IA, this form has higher visibility from the hub page. Ensure that this is ok with SMEs or if it should be removed from the hub page and only accessible from referring pages (i.e. FGIB). 
   - _VBA SME question. Andy to chat with Matt_
 
 - [ ] Tuition Assistance Top-up - this page is currently grouped with ways to use your benefits, but doesn't seem to fit in that grouping. Is this more of a Manage task? Request a Tuition Assistance Top-up?
 
 - [x] Education Benefit Rates - Top level page with many child pages for each year.  Will we update the URLs of all pages, or link off to these pages? https://www.benefits.va.gov/GIBILL/resources/benefits_resources/rate_tables.asp
   - _Link to pages as they are, not updating VA.gov URLs_

 
### Careers
 - [x] Family pages - There are two pages with family benefits and resources. Determine how these two pages can work together or possibly be combined. The goal is to have a single link in the main navigation for Family and Dependent Benefits
   - https://www.vets.gov/employment/job-seekers/family-members/
   - https://www.vets.gov/employment/vocational-rehab-and-employment/family-members/

- [x] General Resource pages - There is a VA page and a Vets pages for "Resources".  Can these be combined?
  - https://www.vets.gov/employment/vocational-rehab-and-employment/external-resources/
  - https://www.benefits.va.gov/vocrehab/links_resources.asp

  -_Solution for both the above open items:  The VA resources page will be "retired" and links to the items on that page will be placed on relevant content pages.  The Vets resources page will be retitled to represent Veteran resources, and the Vets job seekers page will be retitled to represent Family resources.  The Vets family page will remain as is and nested under counseling since it is specific to that benefit. 
 
### Pension
- [x] Historic Benefit Rates - Top level page with many child pages for each year.  Will we update the URLs of all pages, or link off to these pages?https://www.benefits.va.gov/pension/current_rates_veteran_pen.asp
  - _Link to pages as they are, not updating VA.gov URLs_


### Housing
- [x] Natural Disasters PDF - can we alter the name of the PDF or just its location?
  - _Link to page as is, not updating VA.gov URLs_

### Life Insurance
- [ ] Pop-ups - Need to review all pop-ups and determine whether we can eliminate them or need to keep them in the experience. Removing them will require updating all entry point pages to link directly to the associated pdf rather than the pop-up.
  - _Talk with Jennifer, determine if Vets page should link to pop-ups.  Ensure that we are linking to most updated forms._

- [ ] Family content - There are a few benefits/services available to family members that are not readily called out. Options:
  - Move SGLI up and out from under the general options to provide visibility to family/dependent benefits like we do in other hubs?  
  - Create a new static page that includes reference to all the family/dependent options (i.e.FSGLI, Ben Fin Counsel, Will Prep, etc.) similar to how we handled it in Health Care
  
- [ ] Beneficiary Financial Counseling and Online Will Preparation - This was called out by the SME as more of a Manage task.  

- [x] Insurance for Service-Disabled Vets - This appears to be a page that simply brings together all content for service-disabled veterans - similar to how we handle Family/Dependent.  Should we keep this page and where does it belong?
  - https://www.benefits.va.gov/INSURANCE/disabledvet.asp
  - _Page is duplicative content. Will not be included in benefit hub._


### Burials
- [x]  Find a Cemetery - This is a group of pages that will be partly retired, partly moved to new Burials hub and partly left as part of NCA hub.  Need to finalize what this looks like. https://www.cem.va.gov/cem/cems/index.asp
  - _Decision: Keep the Overview page and content in the Burials hub.  On that page, link to Facility Locator for National and State cemeteries links.  DOI and AMBC pages will remain as is and live in NCA hub.  Volunteer and Construction/Design pages will live in NCA hub.  Cemetery detail pages will live in NCA hub, but will be accessible from Facility Locator._ 

- [x] Cemetery Detail Pages - The cemetery locator function will be handled by the Facility Locator by launch.  However, Facility Locator links back to individual cemetery detail pages.  Do the URLs of these pages all update to be part of the Burials hub, or will this content be in the NCA hub?
  - _Decision: Cemetery pages will live in NCA hub, no URL changes._

- [x] Disinterment - This content is not benefit oriented, however it is informational for the Veteran family.  Should we place it under More Resources or should we keep it in the NCA hub? https://www.cem.va.gov/cem/disinterment.asp
  - _Discussed with Jessica, we will leave this content in VHA hub at this time._
  

### Records/Root Level Content
- [x] Claim and Appeal Status - Does the Vets tool include more than Disability statuses.  Do we need a different static page for every status tool, or can we use a single static page to divert traffic through?
  - _Decision: The goal is to have all claim and appeal types available through the Vets.gov tool by launch.  This will mean we can have a single static page that all benefit hubs link to that will describe the statuses that are available and link to a single tool.  If this does not happen, we will keep the single static page, but will link off to different tools as appropriate._

- [x] Appeals - The only content on the site for appeals, is under Disability.  Many benefit hubs have the ability to track an appeal but nothing on filing an appeal. 
  - _Decision: This will be part of a future phase._
  
- [x] Administration Hubs - What work needs to be done, in terms of IA, to ensure that these hubs provide accessibility to all the content that is not included in the benefit hubs, as well as prominent access to the benefit hubs?
  - _Admin hub content will remain as it is today on VA.gov.  Options specific to benefits will be removed from their left navs._

- [ ] ID Cards - identify all the cards to be listed on this static page, and what additional supporting pages are needed for each card type.  Determine which pages we want to optimize for SEO to determine titles, URLs and meta data.
