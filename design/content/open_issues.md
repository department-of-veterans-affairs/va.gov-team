# IA Open Issues

### Health Care
- [ ] Health ID Card page - This page currently exists on VA.gov. Now that we are combining all ID cards into a single static page, do we still need this page that is specific to the Health ID Card.  https://www.va.gov/HEALTHBENEFITS/vhic/index.asp

- [ ] Community Care - Microsite that includes a heavy amount of content that is not geared towards Veterans.  Options:
  - Only link to this microsite from the HC hub page.  Do not make any changes to this site, URLs all stay the same. This content will not appear in the left nav of the HC hub.
  - Create a single static page to include in the HC Benefits hub about Community Care.  That page will appear in the left nav of the HC hub and the new page will link to this microsite. 
  - Move all the content that is pertinent to Veterans into the HC hub.  Change URLs and structure of that content to fit within the HC hub.  It will all appear in the left nav.  All remaining content will stay as is and be findable through the VHA hub.
  
  
### Disability
- [ ] Historic Rate pages - There are main rate pages for the differet types of compensation rates.  Each of them then link to historic rates, each year is a separate page.  Will we be updating the URLs of all of those historic rate pages as well?

- [ ] DBQ Microsite - There are a number of pages about the DBQ and process.  A few pages are not relatd to the Veteran, but most are.  Options:
  - Just link to this set of pages from the Disability hub page.  No changes will be made to the URLs or content of the pages, these pages will not appear in the left nav. 
  - Create a single static page to include in the Dis hub.  The page will appear in the left nav and on the hub page.  The new page will link to this content. 
  - Change the URL of the main page to be part of the HC hub but leave all other pages.  The one page will appear in the left nav. 
  - Move all the content that is pertinent to Veterans in the Dis hub.  Change URLs and structure of those pages as needed.  All remaining content will not be changed and will be findable through the VBA hub. 
  
  
 ### Education
 - [ ] Apply Now Wizard - The current Vets site has a "wizard" that directs users to the correct application.  In the new IA there are contextual links that take users straight to specific forms and bypass the wizard.  Need to discuss this change with SMEs to determine any technical needs or UX challenges. 
 
 - [ ] Contact/Feedback Pages/Regional Processing Offices
 
 - [ ] My Story Microsite
 
 
 ### Life Insurance
- [ ] Pop-ups - Need to review all pop-ups and determine whether we can eliminate them or need to keep them in the experience. 

### Burials
- [ ]  Find a Cemetery - This is a group of pages that will be partly retired, partly moved to new Burials hub and partly left as part of NCA hub.  Need to finalize what this looks like. 
  - Keep the Overview page that then links to Facility Locator
  - Retire the National and State Cemeteries pages
  - Leave the Volunteer and Design pages, they will be findable from the NCA hub

- [ ] Cemetery Detail Pages - The cemetery locator function will be handled by the Facility Locator by launch.  However, Facility Locator links back to individual cemetery detail pages.  Do the URLs of these pages all update to be part of the Burials hub, or will this content be in the NCA hub?
