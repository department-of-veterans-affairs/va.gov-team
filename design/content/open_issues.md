# IA Open Issues

### Health Care
- [ ] Health ID Card page - This page currently exists on VA.gov. Now that we are combining all ID cards into a single static page, do we still need this page that is specific to the Health ID Card.  https://www.va.gov/HEALTHBENEFITS/vhic/index.asp

- [ ] Community Care - Microsite that includes a heavy amount of content that is not geared towards Veterans.  https://www.va.gov/communitycare/ Options:
  - Only link to this microsite from the HC hub page.  Do not make any changes to this site, URLs all stay the same. Clicking on option will take user out of HC hub.
  - Create a single static page to include in the HC hub about Community Care.  This page will keep the user in the HC hub to get high level info. The page will link to this microsite. Going to the microsite will take the user out of the HC hub. 
  
  
### Disability
- [ ] Historic Rate pages - There are main rate pages for the differet types of compensation rates.  Each of them then link to historic rates, each year is a separate page.  Will we be updating the URLs of all of those historic rate pages as well?

- [ ] DBQ Microsite - There are a number of pages about the DBQ and process.  A few pages are not relatd to the Veteran, but most are.  https://www.benefits.va.gov/compensation/dbq_disabilityexams.asp  Options:
   - Only link to this microsite from the Disability hub page.  Do not make any changes to this site, URLs all stay the same. Clicking on option will take user out of the Disability hub.
  - Create a single static page to include in the Disability hub about DBQ.  This page will keep the user in the HC hub to get high level info. The page will link to this microsite. Going to the microsite will take the user out of the Disability hub. 
  - Use the main page of the DBQ as the overview page and move it to the Disability hub (URL change).  Leave all other pages where they are.  Going to other pages will take the user out of the Disability hub. 

  
  
 ### Education
 - [ ] Apply Now Wizard - The current Vets site has a "wizard" that directs users to the correct application.  In the new IA there are contextual links that take users straight to specific forms and bypass the wizard.  Need to discuss this change with SMEs to determine any technical needs or UX challenges. 
 
 - [ ] WAVE Web Automated Verification of Enrollment - Is this redundant to checking your GI Bill benefit status, or is this a different task that should be included in Manage spoke? https://www.gibill.va.gov/wave/index.do
 
 - [ ] My Story Microsite - Do we move (i.e. change URL) this content into the Education hub? https://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/my_story.asp
 
 
 ### Life Insurance
- [ ] Pop-ups - Need to review all pop-ups and determine whether we can eliminate them or need to keep them in the experience. Removing them will require updating all entry point pages to link directly to the associated pdf rather than the pop-up.
- [ ] Family content - There are a few benefits/services available to family members that are not readily called out. Options:
  - Move SGLI up and out from under the general options to provide visibility to family/dependent benefits like we do in other hubs?  
  - Create a new static page that includes reference to all the family/dependent options (i.e.FSGLI, Ben Fin Counsel, Will Prep, etc.) similar to how we handled it in Health Care

### Burials
- [x]  Find a Cemetery - This is a group of pages that will be partly retired, partly moved to new Burials hub and partly left as part of NCA hub.  Need to finalize what this looks like. https://www.cem.va.gov/cem/cems/index.asp
  - Keep the Overview page and content in the Burials hub.  On that page, link to Facility Locator for National and State cemeteries links.  DOI and AMBC pages will remain as is and live in NCA hub.  Volunteer and Construction/Design pages will live in NCA hub.  Cemetery detail pages will live in NCA hub, but will be accessible from Facility Locator.  

- [x] Cemetery Detail Pages - The cemetery locator function will be handled by the Facility Locator by launch.  However, Facility Locator links back to individual cemetery detail pages.  Do the URLs of these pages all update to be part of the Burials hub, or will this content be in the NCA hub?
  - Cemetery pages will live in NCA hub, no URL changes.
