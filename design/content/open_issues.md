Health Care
- [ ] Health ID Card page - This page currently exists on VA.gov. Now that we are combining all ID cards into a single static page, do we still need this page that is specific to the Health ID Card.  https://www.va.gov/HEALTHBENEFITS/vhic/index.asp

- [ ] Community Care - Microsite that includes a heavy amount of content that is not geared towards Veterans.  Options:
  - Only link to this microsite from the HC hub page.  Do not make any changes to this site, URLs all stay the same. This content will not appear in the left nav of the HC hub.
  - Create a single static page to include in the HC Benefits hub about Community Care.  That page will appear in the left nav of the HC hub and the new page will link to this microsite. 
  - Move all the content that is pertinent to Veterans into the HC hub.  Change URLs and structure of that content to fit within the HC hub.  It will all appear in the left nav.  All remaining content will stay as is and be findable through the VHA hub.
