The Frontend Development conducted internal research to better understand the question: 

## **What kind of documentation is useful to you as a developer?**

The platform group would like to know what kind of front end documentation would be useful to you. Currently, we have documentation in several places: vets-website docs folder, vets.gov-team, design-system, etc. We'd like to know what the most useful kind of documentation for us to build.

Below are some questions around documentation. They're ordered from most to least important:

* What are your biggest issues with our current documentation?
* Do you use the component documentation in the design system? 
  * If not, why not?
  * If yes, describe something you looked for in the component documentation
* If there was a site with documentation for code in `vets-website/src/platform`, would you use it?
* When you first started, was there any documentation that we didn't have that would have been helpful?
* Where do you normally look for documentation?
* What's something in vets-website you wish had better documentation?
* Any other thoughts related to documentation that you'd like to share?
* Is there a project or site that you think has great documentation? Why do you think it's great?

This ticket contains multiple responses to the questions above conducted as internal research https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/issues/15613
