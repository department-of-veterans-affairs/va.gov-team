# Platform ATO Approach Outline

## Communications
- GitHub Label: ATO
- Slack channel: N/A
- Product POCs: Michael Spurgeon (michael.spurgeon@adhocteam.us)

## The Problem
ATO is a requirement for launching any new product on the VA.gov platform, but as we've expanded to allow other contracting teams to launch products on VA.gov ATO responsibility and liability has become unclear.

The centerpiece of the ATO questions revolve around the `vets-api` backend repo. *Currently*, Ad Hoc under the Vet.gov contract is responsible for all ATO for the VA.gov platform. 

**Risks of Current ATO Landscape**
- If services built by external contract teams have ATO violations, Ad Hoc is liable for the result
- Services built by external contract teams could change our ATO risk status *(currently moderate risk status)*
- Services built by external contract teams could make it more difficuilt for our internal team to obtain new ATO approval
- If Ad Hoc is responsible for filing all of the ATO for the platform, we could become a bottleneck for other teams who are trying to launch services on the Va.gov platform


### User Goals *(external contract teams)*
- Get ATO approval as quickly as possible
- Avoid impacting the current ATO risk status of the VA.gov platform

### Business Goals *(DSVA/Ad Hoc)*
- Maintain the safety of Veterans information
- Don't assume liability/responsibility for external teams ATO violations
- Don't take on the burden of filing external teams ATO requests

## Assumptions

## Questions
Is it possible to create an ATO process that enables external teams to assume responsibility for their own ATO within the VA.gov platform, without impacting the ATO status of the internal team?
