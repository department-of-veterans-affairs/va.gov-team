Insignia onboarding is S3 or later

For CMS - need to figure out what LOE will be needed to support this once CMS team is gone. It will be wrapping the CMS build/release/deploy process into our process (off of their infra into ours). Need Discovery about what "transition" is and what it isn't, and what ops will look like. As of Oct 1 we need to be ready to take over the parts of CMS that we will be taking over (those parts TBD via Discovery). Decision: w/Wyatt on vacation, we may want to wait unil S3.
