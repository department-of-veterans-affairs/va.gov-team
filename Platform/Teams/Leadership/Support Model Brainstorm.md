# Support model brainstorm

## Problem statement
In our original vision of VSP, the Prod Dev Support team was responsible for all VFS team support and reviews. In reality, the volume of code reviews is exceeding this team's ability to handle and ends up taking about 20-30% of **all** VSP engineers' time (not just Prod Dev Support engineer's time). Additionally, we're benefiting from the expertise of senior team members in these reviews, but spending time on reviews decreases their capacity to move forward on Platform development. 

**How might we structure a Support model on VSP that enables us to support VFS teams in the most effective and scalable way?**

## Goals
- Keep work moving ahead for VFS teams (i.e. don't be a bottleneck they have to wait on)
- Notice red flags and recommend adjustments (i.e. leverage expertise of senior members)
- Don't burn people out
- Don't impede VSP's ability to have time and mental energy to work on the Platform itself
- Allow for easy scaling to support more teams

## Components
- [Rotate across VSP for code reviews](#Rotate-across-VSP-for-code-reviews)
- [Engage with rich Prod Dev Support Team mission](#Engage-with-rich-Prod-Dev-Support-Team-mission)
- [Scale through full VSP team augmentation](#Scale-through-full-VSP-team-augmentation)
- [Reduce per capita support needs](#Reduce-per-capita-support-needs)

## Rotate code reviews across all VSP engineers
_what does this look like?_

- Idea: what if extend this reviewe model past just Engineering? For design reviews, analytics reviews, etc? That way the Prod Dev Support team wouldn't really have to grow as VFS Teams increase, they can stay focused on building the Platform UX and answering questions in Slack...

## Engage with rich Prod Dev Support Team mission
_what does this look like?_

- Something beyond just onboarding and answering quesetions in Slack. Something more like creating a delightful e2e user journey for VFS Teams building things w/Platform.

## Scale through full VSP team augmentation 
_what does this look like?_

- Add Eng talent to other existing teams to help w/code review burden
- Add Design talent to other existing teams to help w/design review burden???
- What about ATO? Analytics? 508? QA?
- Prod Dev Support individuals:
  - Product
  - Design
  - Eng
  - QA
  - 508
  - ATO
  - Content
  - IA
  - Analytics
  - Call center

## Reduce per capita support needs
_what does this look like?_
- Invest in automation
  - Prioritize iterative checks automated tests so teams can catch their own stuff as they go
  - Would love to incorporate content plain language and other practice area checks into automated testing, right now it's mostly focused on code cleanliness.
- Invest in expectation setting
  - Like ROEs and Onboarding
- Invest in Support Experience Leadership team to design end-to-end user journey
  - Improvements to the user journey to be identified through resaerch
