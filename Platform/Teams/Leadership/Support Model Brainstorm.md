# Support model brainstorm

## Goals
- Keep work moving ahead for VFS teams (i.e. don't be a bottleneck they have to wait on)
- Notice red flags and recommend adjustments (i.e. leverage expertise of senior members)
- Don't burn people out
- Don't impede VSP's ability to have time and mental energy to work on the Platform itself
- Allow for easy scaling to support more teams

## Components
- [Rotate across VSP for code reviews](#Rotate-across-VSP-for-code-reviews)
- [Engage with rich Prod Dev Support Team mission](#Engage-with-rich-Prod-Dev-Support-Team-mission)
- [Scale through full VSP team augmentation](#Scale-through-full-VSP-team-augmentation)
- [Reduce per capita support needs](#Reduce-per-capita-support-needs)

## Rotate code reviews across all VSP engineers
_what does this look like?_

- Idea: what if extend this reviewe model past just Engineering? For design reviews, analytics reviews, etc? That way the Prod Dev Support team wouldn't really have to grow as VFS Teams increase, they can stay focused on building the Platform UX and answering questions in Slack...

## Define Prod Dev Support team's mission as more than just onboarding and answering questions in Slack
_what does this look like?_

## Scale through full VSP team augmentation 
_what does this look like?_

- Add Eng talent to other existing teams to help w/code review burden
- Add Design talent to other existing teams to help w/design review burden???
- What about ATO? Analytics? 508? QA?
- Prod Dev Support individuals:
  - Product
  - Design
  - Eng
  - QA
  - 508
  - ATO
  - Content
  - IA
  - Analytics
  - Call center

## Reduce per capita support needs
_what does this look like?_
- Invest in automation
- Invest in Support Experience Leadership team to design end-to-end user journey
