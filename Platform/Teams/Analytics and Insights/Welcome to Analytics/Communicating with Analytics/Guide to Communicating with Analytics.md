## Requesting Access to Google Analytics

### As a part of the initial weeks of onboarding
1. Make sure every team member has a Google account tied to their corporate or va.gov email. **Email addresses ending in `gmail.com` _**may not**_ be used. If the user has a VA.gov or work email address that is not linked to a Google account, they will need to create one by visiting [this link](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?continue=https%3A%2F%2Faccounts.google.com%2FManageAccount&gmb=exp&biz=false&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp). VA.gov users and external users with email accounts that are not Google based should select the option "Use my current email address instead".

    If the user already has a Google account that is not yet linked to their VA.gov email, they can link it using [these instructions](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/176347?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en).
    
2. Product managers will provide Google account linked emails to the analytics team on a slack message to `#vsp-analytics`. VSP Analytics and Insights will provide Google Analytics access to corresponding accounts within 4 business days.

### Post Onboarding: ad hoc Google Analytics access requests
1. Make sure the requested user(s) has a Google account tied to their corporate or va.gov email. **Email addresses ending in `gmail.com` _**may not**_ be used. If the user has a VA.gov or work email address that is not linked to a Google account, they will need to create one by visiting [this link](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?continue=https%3A%2F%2Faccounts.google.com%2FManageAccount&gmb=exp&biz=false&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp). VA.gov users and external users with email accounts that are not Google based should select the option "Use my current email address instead".

    If the user already has a Google account that is not yet linked to their VA.gov email, they can link it using [these instructions](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/176347?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en).
    
2. Send a Slack message to `#vsp-analytics` with the requested user(s) email address, any properties the user(s) might require _(e.g. eBenefits, MHV, WBC, a single modernized product area view, developer.va.gov, etc.)_., and the team, project, or office this request is for.
