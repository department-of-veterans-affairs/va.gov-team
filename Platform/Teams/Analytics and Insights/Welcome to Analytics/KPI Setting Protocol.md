# KPI Setting Protocol

**Goal**: All VFS teams will have Key Performance Indicators set up, be supported in tracking their data, and use these metrics for data-driven product decisions and goals. 

## KPI Setting Workshops (_As a part of the initial weeks of Onboarding_)
1. The VSP Analytics and Insights Team (VSP Insights) will set up 2 hour workshops with teams building products or services in the VA.gov ecosystem - this includes VFS and VSP Teams. VSP Insights will provide an editable copy of the [KPI Setting Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LGN2TKNwmobdl4yhxjyd_bua22KUkW3K56RU7yHMNrk/edit#gid=221438008) to each team before the workshop for teams to meet internally and fill out the pre-work areas of the template. **RR note: maybe, since the doc is a Google Sheet, we can instead have the pre-work be a .md template they fill out in GH and come to the KPI meeting with? Then we have the Google Sheet screenshared to collab during the meeting, and share as an Excel file w/them afterward. Thoughts?**
2. VSP Insights will facilitate the KPI Workshop itself, to lead teams through setting the KPIs for their product(s). Teams will collaborate in this meeting via screenshare, to fill out a KPIs Google Sheet hosted by VSP Insights.
3. Post-workshop, VSP Insights will Slack an Excel version of the Google Sheet to the team, and the team will upload it to their product folder.

## Ongoing KPI Setting (_Post Onboarding_)
1. VSP Insights will incorporate results from KPI workshops and check-ins to the Product Health Tool.
2. VSP Insights will perform quarterly KPI check-ins with each team. 
    - These check-ins will incorporate the KPI results, resulting actions, and any adjustments to KPIs.
3. VSP Insights will be readily available for team questions and updates on KPIs and product health metrics through the #vfs-platforrm-support Slack channel.
