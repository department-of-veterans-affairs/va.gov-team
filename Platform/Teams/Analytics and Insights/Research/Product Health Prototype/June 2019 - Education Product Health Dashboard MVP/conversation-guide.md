## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Layla and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the initial prototype for the Education Product Health Analytics dashboard. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet the needs of product owners. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record your screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

*Start screen recording using Zoom.*

## Warm Up Questions - 5-10 minutes
* Before we start, I want to take a few minutes to ask you some questions.
* Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? (Role at DSVA, what product do they focus on)

#### General product health questions
* If you could access all of your product analytics in one place, where would you expect to access it?
* For your specific product/role, which metrics are the most important to you?
   * How often you need access to those metrics?
   * Is there case where you would want to be notified about certain changes? If so, how would you like to be notified?
   * Do you ever need to share those metrics? With whom? In what format?
* Do you have specific deadlines for reporting metrics? Can you explain what drives those deadlines?

## Get comfortable on the machine
* Okay. I'm going to give you control of my laptop and ask you to complete a few tasks.

## First task: React to Education Product Health Analytics dashboard

Okay, I am going to ask you to open the Education Product Health Analytics dashboard by clicking the other tab.

* Take a moment to scan this page, and tell me what you're looking at here.
    * What is the purpose of this page?
    * What do you think you can do here?
* Based on what you see here, which product needs your immediate attention?
* How would you expect to learn about an urgent issue? 
* What steps would you take next?


## Second task: React to product statuses
* What do the different product statuses mean to you?
* Is there a product status that is missing?


## Third task: Interpret product health
* Which products are performing the best? How do you know?
* Which products are preforming the worst? How do you know?
* Are there any metrics that are unclear?
* Are there any metrics that you don't need? 
* Are there any metrics that are missing?
* What would you do to learn more about a specific metric?


## Fourth task: Drill into a metric
* Which metrics can you drill in to see more detail? What kind of detail do you expect to see?
* Go ahead and drill in to a metric. 
   * Tell me about what you see here.
   * Is this what you were expecting?
* If you had questions or needed support for this dashboard, who would you ask?

## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the dashboard and make sure it really works for product owners.
