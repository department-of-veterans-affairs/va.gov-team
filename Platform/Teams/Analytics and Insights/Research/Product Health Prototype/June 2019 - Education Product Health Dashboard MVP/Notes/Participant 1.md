### role:
Focuses on the platform as a product and watches for issues and ways to improve teams who improve va.gov

### Expect to access: 
Most ideal: something that is both public and useful to the team. Tracks site and links off to google analytics. Raw metrics + insights and indicators. Things we keep an eye on to see if they change, like funnel, but if we improve the platform it doesn’t change how many people use it. 

Want to change how much time and ease it takes for people to use the tool plus uptime. 

Public: redesign of scorecard that’s focused on key results. 


### How often do you want to have access and updates:
Level of health and uptime and throughput that pushes if there’s a change. Then check the other stuff on a weekly basis on Friday or Monday morning. Have an idea of what’s going on on the products. Depends on what stage of the process the product is in. 

Tie in the work that needs to be done with the realtime. 

### Notifications:
- Error rates increasing
- Unique error rates
- Uptime 
- big drop offs of completion rates

Notified by: 
Slack bot? Fits into normal notification patterns.

Does urgency effect how you want to see it:
Triage team handles emergency. More worried about if completion rate has slipped below a threshold. 

### Sharing out 
Leadership interest. 
- Testified to congress
- New launch
- Anniversary of product 

Make the case for our style of work and how we do it like conduct research. Get stories out about how it has an impact to build political capital. Storytelling promotion. 

### Deadlines:
Major congressional deadlines, contract award change, new acts, and anticipate the politics. 

### [Prototype]
“I like the coloring, I feel a lot less under attack”

It’s nice not to open it and see huge blocks of red. Differentiating what’s on fire to what’s normally bad. 

On the lookout for red

Disabled feels broken because it’s red. Worries me. 

It’s hard to know what each form is. helpful to have link to actual form so folks could learn more. 

light pink means below target/warning. 

I’d also wonder if the team set specific funnel conversion goals. Curious if the funnel conversion goal is the same for all of them. 

Would want to maybe see what the goal is. 

(Found the description note text) 

I keep jumping around to different use cases. Like the product manager for the product or for me. I wouldn’t want to necessarily see the goal all the time, because I’d want to trust the number and symbol. 

199N has a high error rate. I’d either click on (product name) or the (error rate)

I’d expect the (product name) to show me the form and where it was on the site. I’d expect the (error rate) to go to google analytics, but I’d probably just talk to the product manager and create more swirl and question. Curious to know what the backend was and if the backend wasn’t available. Do some digging to see

Add a note to see if it was being addressed and see how graceful the error path is. 

Error rate, repeat event, funnel conversion = most important. 

Why are they all the same latency? Are they all relying on the same system? 

### Top 5: 
- Call volume definitely. 
- Is CSAT the customer call volume thing? Is it the popup feedback? 
- Offline vs online, look at more if there’s more space in the backlog to dive in more if the gap isn’t significant. Rough stab in the dark to the more meaningful metrics. More powerful story for leadership. Less of a vanity metric. 

### Product statuses:
- Disabled - taken off site, but the red x makes me worried it’s fine
- Active checkmark makes me feel like it’s fine. 
- Maintenance makes me feel like there are issues, but they are being addressed, and the tool might be unavailable. 
- Warning is I should check that out
- What would you want to see for down? FIRE EMOJI, red X and unresponsive or significant problems or delays. 
- If something was down, I would expect a whole thing to be happening. 

### What project is doing the best?
The ones with the most stars, double check against the monthly. 

### Metrics that aren’t clear: 
I think the main thing is why latency is the same for multiple products. I would assume the front end would have an impact on latency. 

Error rate, there are tons of different error rates. 

But pretty straightforward	

### Get rid of:
Don’t look at total or unique unless a percent is really wack. I don’t really need it here, because I’m mostly worried about something falling bellow a threshold or a change. Just getting a sense of scale. I’m still concerned about the error rate regardless of the number. 

Total numbers are useful for telling stories., but not useful to me unless it’s part of a big aggregate. 

Definitely (the unfilled columns). Making them less vanity in terms of storytelling or success. 

What else is the team using to track

Want to see where in the funnel people are dropping off. If it took me to the specific overview of the funnel in google analytics and I could poke around. 

### Versions:
I like the colors. 
I think the only thing that concerns me is that you get fatigue from something showing up as a red alert. I like the gradient between the two warning colors. 

I think I like the symbols more. They’re easier on the eyes and I want to spend more time looking at this. 

### Missing:
Interested to see spikes in traffic. If there was a spike beyond an average level and there was an icon. Would want to pay more attention to it. 

More on the PR side of what’s happening and why people are coming to us.
