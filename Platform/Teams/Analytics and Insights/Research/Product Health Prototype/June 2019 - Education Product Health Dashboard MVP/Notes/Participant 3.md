Project person for VA.gov 

### Cares about:
- Overall availability and success of a product
        - Up, available, can people find it and submit
- Are users able to find it and understand it
- Is it achieving the goal? Are forms being submitted in a way that helps them 

- increases the use of self service tools for people who want them. Want to see more online and less in person. And a reduction in overall time to process/receive benefit

- Younger veterans are using different forms and probably more inclined to use online forms. 

- I’d see a tool online, log in with va info.

### Public:
I’m all for it, but might be a problem with va

### Notifications: 
- Downstream systems that are brittle. It would be good to be able to tell people this before they start. 
- Transparency into entire process. Ex starting now, 17 steps between now and you getting benefits
- Too much communication and too many methods. Less important for me, than for someone who can do something about it, like putting a message up. I’d want to know, but it’s more important for other people. 
- Would want to know where to look for it. Message to noise ratio. 

### Share metrics: 
- Data - excel - chart - powerpoint slide
- Google analytics - screenshot- powerpoint slide
- Desired: access to raw data and some visualization. So it can be moved to a powerpoint slide

### [prototype]
- Missed the key
- Its nice
- Standard status page, if its up or failing, perfect snapshot of what’s going and not going. 
- Rollover text is nice
- Warning is something that is operating but having an issue, like slow or low success rate. 
- Disabled, I’m not sure

- I’m going to assume that the data below matches. 
- Trying to match the weekly stats to the current stats
- Total events is unclear to me. Is it form submissions? Is it button clicks? What is total and unique?
- CSAT are the numbers that I’m interested in. Call volume, offline vs online tell me if people are happy with it. This is exactly the function/user split I was talking about. 
- I should be interested in deploys. I assume it gets deployed every day. Good to have if it was 3 months ago. 

### Wouldn’t use: 
I don’t think there are any that I would	need. These are 2 different states, product health vs product engagement

### Missing: 
This over time. Want to see chart over time to see trends. What’s going up or down over time or holding steady. 

The detail on each for the forms. And graph over time of salient metric, which is all of them. 

### Weekly and monthly snapshots:
Monthly I like a lot, helps show general growth. Needs to have at lease 13 months, because it matters, this month vs last month. Education has seasonality with application season. Seeing the same month from the previous year. 

Weekly and daily numbers are great for new products or change in products. I would like to be able to pick my own range

Found the support channel. 

Current product icons make sense. Disabled is odd, but eventually made sense. 

Key was up above, so I didn’t know where to look for it, and it’s less obvious. Stock ticker quote with comparison to previous week or day with arrow. Or mini spark chart. Might be too much for all of them, but useful for the one that are out of line. Stop sign did not convey that to me. 

Benchmarks should be set by product owner. In conjunction with technical product person. They should be reviewed like quarterly. 

### Versions:
Color
I like it. It makes it stand out a little bit more. These pope out more 
The light blue I don’t automatically know what that implies. I’m an excel guy, so I prefer this to the icons. Where this is going to get funky if the perimeters aren’t set right, and everything is a color.

Emoji
This has 0 meaning to me. 
I can’t tell between the smile and the grin
Thumbs up is common, the other ones are too too much thinking. 

I don’t know the different between the form numbers. I’d much rather see the goal of the form. It’s a problem if you’re new to VA. and it’s a problem for users. 

The products are the education products, but it applies broadly to everything that we do, but make it generalized enough. 

request that it’s automated and that the non- automated is as easy to update as possible so it’s not terrible to update.
