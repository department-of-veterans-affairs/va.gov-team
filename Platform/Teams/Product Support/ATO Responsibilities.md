# ATO Lead's Mission

Ensure that VSP and the VSP-hosted applications across VA.gov have the Authority to Operate. And, equally as important, ensure that VSP's ATO process doesn't impede the culture of agile, iterative product development.

# Areas of focus

1) Clean up VSP ATO
2) Move VSP ATO to the split model (so VSP has a base ATO that covers some cross-VA.gov things, and VFS Teams are responsible for the ATO of their specific products)  
3) Define process by which VFS Teams contribute to ATO
4) Support VFS Teams by answering questions and providing guidance as they take care of their own ATO

# Logistics
Hang out on the Tools team to start, so that you can meet with those engineers, understand how vets-api works, what kind of data we consume, how that data is used across VA.gov - all of this to help you understand the best way for us to stay compliant with our ATO.

Next phase, will be moving over to your more permanenent team: Product Development Support. This is where, once we have a solid ATO model in place, you will be working with VFS Teams to check that they have the appropriate ATO for their products and help them through any ATO questions they have.
