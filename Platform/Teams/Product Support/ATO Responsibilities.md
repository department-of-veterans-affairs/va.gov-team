# ATO Lead's Mission

Ensure that VSP and the VSP-hosted applications across VA.gov have the Authority to Operate. And, equally as important, ensure that VSP's ATO process doesn't impede the culture of agile, iterative product development.

# Areas of focus

1) Clean up VSP ATO
2) Move VSP ATO to the split model
3) Define process by which VFS Teams contribute to ATO
4) Support VFS Teams by answering questions and providing guidance as they take care of their own ATO
