# Preface
This document will help all team members working on VA.gov understand when it is appropriate to engage the Triage team for support and provide relevant information to assist in routing reported issues to other appropriate teams.  Because of the limited number of resources on Triage, they cannot be a "catch-all" for every issue reported on the platform and every application.  Please read the following document carefully in order to determine the appropriate path for your incident.

## When it is OK to engage the Triage Team

* When the incident is believed to be **Severity 1** which can be defined as
  * A significant amount of users are impacted
  * Issue resolution is required in a 24 hour period
  * Part of (or all of) va.gov is severely disrupted

Examples:
- VA.gov is inaccessabile
- Thousands of users cannot access their claims
- Platform errors causing extreme delays for users

Think Triage is the right place?  Please allow Product Managers Owner to initiate the contact. (Maybe?)

## When is it NOT ok to engage the Triage Team

* Severity 2/3 Bugs
* Bugs that currently have a team (see Products to Owner Map Here)
* Feature Improvements 

Examples:
- A bug that is effecting a handful of users from accessing their benefits
- A request to update a page with content

## Difference between a Bug and an Incident
**Incident:** An unplanned interruption. When the operational status of any activity turns from working to failed and causes the system to behave in an unplanned manner it is an incident. A problem can cause multiple incidents which are to be resolvedâ€”preferably as soon as possible.

**Bug:** A defect found by a tester or reported by a user that is not stopping a user from sucessfully achieving their goal but needs to be addressed in a timely manner.

## Still not sure?
If you still have a doubt about where to report your incident for whatever reason, please reach out to the #vsp-triage slack channel and we would be happy to assist you.
