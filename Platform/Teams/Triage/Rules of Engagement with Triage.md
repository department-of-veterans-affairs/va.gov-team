# Preface
This document will help all team members working on VA.gov understand when it is appropriate to engage the Triage team for support and provide relevant information to assist in routing reported issues to other appropriate teams.  Because of the limited number of resources on Triage, they cannot be a "catch-all" for every issue reported on the platform and every application.  Please read the following document carefully in order to determine the appropriate path for your incident.

## When it is OK to engage the Triage Team

* When the incident is believed to be **Severity 1** which can be defined as
  * A significant amount of users are impacted
  * Issue resolution is required in a 24 hour period
  * Part of (or all of) va.gov is severely disrupted
  
* When an issue is discovered that is not in your products scope of work
 * Any issue that is discovered that is outside your teams scope of work can be reported to Triage
 * In this case severity does not matter
 
If you already know which team the issue should be routed to, you can reach out to their pont of contact to confirm and directly asssign the issue to them.  If you aren't sure which team owns the issue and would like to send it directly to them without the assistance of Triage, the [Product Owner Mapping Document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hzz6whEGoQJQbiNvIggirhydYYdv57nfOZfLvFqZ1pQ/edit?ts=5d28958a#gid=1535759874) can help guide you in the right direction.

*The Product Owner Mapping Document listed above is a living document.  If you would like to suggest edits to add or change owner to products please reach out to the PM of Triage (Alex Pappas).  It is also protected as this is a public repo*
 
NOTE: Assigning an issue to Triage using the [Triage Incident Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=&labels=triage%2C+triage-incident&template=triage-incident-template.md&title=) does not guarentee the work will be completed by the triage team.  Triage will do their own investigation, priotization and scoping to determine the best team to be resonsible for resolution.

## When is it NOT ok to engage the Triage Team

* Bugs that belong within your own team
* Feature Improvements that belong within your own team
* What are we missing here?

## Still not sure?
If you still have a doubt about where to report your incident for whatever reason, please reach out to the #vsp-triage slack channel and we would be happy to assist you.

When in doubt, submmit it through our [Triage Incident Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=&labels=triage%2C+triage-incident&template=triage-incident-template.md&title=)

## Difference between a Bug and an Incident (for reference)
**Incident:** An unplanned interruption. When the operational status of any activity turns from working to failed and causes the system to behave in an unplanned manner it is an incident. A problem can cause multiple incidents which are to be resolvedâ€”preferably as soon as possible.

**Bug:** A defect found by a tester or reported by a user that is not stopping a user from sucessfully achieving their goal but needs to be addressed in a timely manner.

Create a process flow diagram to compliment what is being said in a visaul manner

Do we want to have examples for when to engage and when not to engage?
Examples:
- VA.gov is inaccessabile
- Thousands of users cannot access their claims
- Platform errors causing extreme delays for users
- You notice and issue on the site that isn't related to your work.

Examples:
- A bug that is effecting a handful of users from accessing their benefits
- A request to update a page with content
