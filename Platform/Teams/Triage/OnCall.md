# On Call
The [OnCall](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/tree/master/Practice%20Areas/Engineering/OnCall#on-call-rotation-standard-operating-procedure) directory in vets.gov-team is the primary source of information for On call documentation, including [Incident Categorization](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Engineering/OnCall/Incident%20Categorization.md).

The [Emergency Contacts / Information](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/devops#emergency-contacts--information) section of the devops repo, especially [Incident Response Playbook](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/devops#incident-response-playbook) is and additional source of quality information. 

External Service Integrations are documented in both the [devops repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/devops/tree/master/docs/External%20Service%20Integrations) and [vets.gov-team repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Engineering/OnCall/Services.md)

https://dsva.pagerduty.com/schedules is the authoritative source for the on call schedule, but is duplicated here for the visibilty of those without pagerduty accounts. ![june2019 pagerduty schedule](./june2019oncallSchedule.png)
