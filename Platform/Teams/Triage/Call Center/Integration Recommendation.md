## Preface:

The purpose of this document is to recommend what is needed, why it is needed, and how it will be obtained in order to fulfill the mission of the Contact Center Lead.  This is to be the liaison between the Call Center(s) and development teams to escalate Tier 2 and Tier 3 issues.

This document is only a recommendation and will be updated accordingly.


## Current State of Contact Center:

It has previously been determined that there are multiple Call Centers that work together, however, none of them implicitly support VA.gov.

Also, there is currently no way to escalate VA.gov issues that customers/vets are having therefore making it difficult to track and resolve.

It is the goal that The White House VA Hotline is the Call Center that will be handling these calls once processes have been created and training has been provided.  

 

## What:

It is the recommendation of the Call Center Lead to obtain access to SalesForce, a platform/program in which the WHH uses to capture call data.  

The access can be read only as long as there are permissions to run reports.

In the future, if Call Centers are transitioned to Microsoft Dynamics, the Contact Center Lead will need access to that platform/program in order to continue the mission.


## Why:

In order to improve the veteran experience on VA.gov, the Contact Center Lead needs to be able to access Tier 2 and Tier 3 data.  Being able to gain appropriate access to SalesForce will allow the Contact Center Lead to:
Run reports.
Review the data.
Parse (if necessary) and export the data to correct teams.
Investigate internally and resolve within the Contact Center team.
 Make further recommendations on how to move forward with the data that is obtained and presenting the data to the appropriate teams.
Continuously improve the veteran experience on VA.gov.


## How:

An introduction to the correct POC at the WHH Call Center is how this recommendation is going to be completed.  This portion of the recommendation may need to be initiated by Chante since a relationship has already been established. 

A request directly from Chante to the WHH POC on behalf of Kimberley is also an option.

## Questions:

What is the current state of transition from SalesForce to Microsoft Dynamics?
Will this transition be within the next 6 months?
Is there the ability to make edits in the current SalesForce platform?
Are there reports currently being provided to VSP from WHH that reflects amount of calls, breakdown of call types, escalated call types, talk time, abandoned calls details, or repeat issues? 
Access to reporting or data that is being provided to the VA is needed.
How often is this data being reported to the VSP teams?
What timeframe is being reported to the VSP teams?

## Next Steps:

Documents have been provided to the Contact Center Lead for review.  Call Center document review/training is being held on Monday with Chante and Kimberley.
