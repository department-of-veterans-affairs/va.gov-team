It is the recommendation of the Call Center Lead to obtain access to SalesForce, a platform/program in which the WHH uses to capture data.  

Assumption that WHH is the center that will be handling all issues, this is not in stone.

Being able to gain access to SalesForce will allow the Contact Center Lead to review the data that is obtained and make further recommendations on how to move forward with presenting the data to the appropriate teams.
