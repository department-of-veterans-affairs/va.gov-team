# Gatsby Documentation
- Live URL: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/veteran-facing-services-tools

## Problem Statment
The Frontend documentation for VA.gov is difficult to navigate, because they're spread out across various source and because GH's search isn't great for docs. 

As a Veteran Facing Services *(VFS)* frontend developer, I need to be able to access the appropriate infomation for building and updating the VA.gov Platform frontend code without support from the current VA.gov development team.

Currently, the React component docs at https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/design-system are useful, but that site has been so difficult to maintain that it has now been deprecated (the painfulness of that tooling was one reason for DSVA creating two new Jekyll sites: the handbook and the new design system site).

## User Groups
1. New frontend developers on the VFS platform
1. Existing fronend developers on the VFS platform

## Goals
### User Goals
#### New Frontends
- I want to be able to easily navigate the Frontend docs
- I want to be able to see live examples of React components that I can build with and direction on when those elements are suppose to be used
- I want to be able to search to quickly access specific frontend resources I'm looking for

#### Existing Frontends
- I want updating documentation to be easy 
- I want to be able to search to quickly access specific frotend resources that I'm looking for

### Business Goals 
- Limit the time it takes to onboard a new frontend teammember
- Remove the need for asking clarifying FE docs questions to the current VFS team 

## Assumptions
- New frontend developers that use this documentation know how to use React

## Value Propositions
The Gatsby site is intended to consolidate the relevant front end docs in one site that is searchable and easy to use, as well as closing the gap that we now have with React component documentation.

It also gives us the ability to write richer docs, that use our shared components live on the site to make examples and tutorials easier to follow.

## Solution Approach
The plan for this site is to live on github at https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/veteran-facing-services-tools

**Step 1**
- Aggregate and develop Information Architecture for FE docs - happening [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/167wfEPR7M77EY6s-K4zJ_REOJL3KfNOy4-3fZJEUERw/edit)
