# Rules of Engagement for Escalation during Oct 9 - Nov 9

**Please use good judgement in determining whether something is truly an emergency and needs escalation outside of normal working hours.**

### Oct 9 - Oct 12: "Critical Feature Complete"

On call escalation contacts will be responsive during reasonable business hours (M - F , 9 AM ET - 6 PM ET) via cell phone to support emergencies.

Alex, Paul, Curtis, James travel to NSOC in WV to meet team and establish working relationships.

### Oct 15 - 17: Ad Hoc Retreat

On call escalation contacts may not be fully available due to Ad Hoc retreat and the full day DSVA workshops. Call Rachael Roueche if there is a true emergency.

### Oct 18 - Nov 4: Final Stretch

On call escalation contacts will be responsive during a broader range of hours (7 days a week, 9 AM ET - 9 PM ET) via the cell phone to support emergencies.

### Nov 5 - 9: Launch Window

On call escalation contacts will be responsive at all hours via cell phone as needed to support emergency pre-launch, launch, and post-launch needs.

The following members will be on site at NSOC in West Virginia:
- [ ] Curtis?

The following members will be in-person ***Location with good internet TBD***" from 9am to 7pm.

- Chris Johnston

# The Plays

*thresholds and plays still tbd for these scenarios: major tweet, hack, errors in teamsite injections, horrible user feedback,
call center totally overwhelmed*

## Traffic migration

### Happy Path

1. Start call with NSOC
1. Wyatt routes 5% of production www.va.gov traffic through production VAEC
1. After 15 min, if error rate < 99.9% and 90th percentile latency < 2.5 seconds, move to next step
1. Wyatt routes 15% of production www.va.gov traffic through production VAEC
1. After 10 minutes end the call with NSOC
1. Brian disseminates Load Testing Status Report
1. After 24 hours, if error rate < 99.9% and 90th percentile latency < 2.5 seconds, move to next step
1. Wyatt routes 50% of production www.va.gov traffic through production VAEC
1. Brian disseminates Load Testing Status Report
1. After the weekend, if error rate < 99.9% and 90th percentile latency < 2.5 seconds 
1. Wyatt routes 100% of production www.va.gov traffic through production VAEC
1. Brian disseminates Load Testing Status Report
1. Continue if error rate < 99.9% and 90th percentile latency < 2.5 seconds continuously

### Error rate > 99.9%

***Work in progress - to be defined by Oct 4***

### 90th percentile latency > 2.5 seconds

***Work in progress - to be defined by Oct 4***

## Load Testing
Load testing will focus on local HTML assets and larger local assets (images, css, javascript), as well as proxied HTML assets, and lager proxied assets (images, css, javascript).

***Details of the play in progress - to be defined by Oct 4***

### Happy Path

### Crisis plan: 

- Load test 5 times steady state production traffic against staging.va.gov
- Load test 5 times steady state production traffic (if NSOC and OIT says OK) against preview.va.gov


## Launch Crises

### Rollback

1. Certain criteria/thresholds are met (***to be defined by Nov 5)***, for example: 
  - Spike in errors above baseline (define baseline based on historical log)
  - Latency > X seconds sustained for > X seconds for > X of traffic

2. On call party informs Rachael and James
3. Rachael updates Chris w/Launch Status Report including instructions for communicating decision (***template to defined by Nov 5)***
3. Chris makes decision to rollback based on data in the Launch Report
4. Chris disseminates decision via Slack and email (***recipients TBD, but must at least include OIT since traffic will be reverted to them***), and calls James
5. James coordinates with on call party
6. On call party deploys configuration update to revert back, and monitors grafana dashboards
7. Rachael updates Chris (***and OIT and other stakeholders?***) w/Launch Status Report
8. All parties stay on the joinme line until it's resolved.
9. Rachael updates Chris (***and OIT and other stakeholders?***) w/Launch Status Report

If not resolved...

### Rollback fails, put up a maintenance page

1. Certain criteria/thresholds are met (***to be defined by Nov 5)***
