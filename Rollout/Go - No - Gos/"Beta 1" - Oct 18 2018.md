# "Beta 1" Go / No Go 
## Oct 18, 2018

## Decision: 

---

**Performance monitoring: ready.**

**Traffic handling: ready.**

**Griffins products: ready.**

**Rainbows products: ready.**

**Dragons products: ready.**
- Still want UAT though

**Unicorns products: not ready.**
- PR w/changes is ready but not in prod, so need to see that in prod to make a Go decision
- Note: EVSS services are in and out right now, Call Center number
- Note: Frank Bryceland mentioned that EVSS was concerned/not ready/not apprised of launch, and Dale said he knew nothing about it. Andrea has already discussed - Frank was concerned we were turning "off" eBenefits and has been reassured that this is not the case, seems to be resolved.

**Search: ready.**

**Analytics: ready.**

**Call Center: ready**
- No LOVs to collect feedback for us
- But they are ready to answer questions
- Need targeting communications w/simple images to help Call Center conversations. The homepage is changing, but all the tools are the same, and you won't have to manage 2 versions of health tools (no more Vets.gov health tools).
- Not a blocker for preview/beta launch, but need 13818 to be complete quickly

- Anything that's in context (for example: https://staging.va.gov/disability-benefits/apply/form-526-disability-claim/introduction) we want the specific number that relates to that context, AND the MyVA311 number. So if there's a question about filling out the form, HRC can help with that. And we can also include the MyVA311 number so it's globally available. And then for GI Bill tool, there's the specific GI Bill number AND the MyVA311 number.

- On any page there can be up to 3 numbers:
  - The department-specific number (like a VBA help desk number for any VBA form). The current component for Need Help on forms is a generic forms component, so can't include this specific admin number in it.
  - The "tech support" number, which goes straight to HRC. Doesn't go on every page, only the Veteran Facing Tool pages
  - ON every page MyVA311 which is a generic number that can route you to the right place.

- 

- Tomorrow (10/19) need to run through strategy with Denise and Trish so we can use most helpful numbers where appropriate

**Messaging to internal VA community: ready**

**Messaging to Digital Modernization Community: ready**

**Are there too many things broken: ready.**

**Dashboard: ready.**
- Still want UAT though

**Login / SSO: not ready**
- BUT....
- Pop-up blocker issue, no short term fix but there are things we might be able to look into around the way the screen looks if the pop-up is  blocked. Not a short term couple of day thing though.
- Bigger problem about how our SSO works today: session doesn't get destroyed if logout happens on MHV side. Trying to figure out complications - is this a launch blocker? Session timeout is 30 min.
- Need estimates on a fix to be able to make a decision.
- Need estimates on reverting back to non SSO if ^ is too much time.

**Teamsite header/footer injection: ready.**

**Vets.gov Banner: ready.**

**Fallback option: ready.**
- Anyone can recommend that we do this to Chris, but Chris will make ultimate decision
- Uses a single value stored in build settings, and can update w/o a deployment cycle to update the text in the banner and the link.

**Next Go / No Go will be Monday**
