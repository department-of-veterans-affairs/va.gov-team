# "Beta 1" Go / No Go 
## Oct 18, 2018

## Decision: 

---

**Performance monitoring: ready.**

**Traffic handling: ready.**

**Griffins products: ready.**

**Rainbows products: ready.**

**Dragons products: ready.**
- Still want UAT though

**Unicorns products: not ready.**
- PR w/changes is ready but not in prod, so need to see that in prod to make a Go decision
- Note: EVSS services are in and out right now, Call Center number
- Note: someone needs to brief EVSS on launch and what this means for what "production" now means for their services

**Search: ready.**

**Analytics: ready.**

**Call Center: ready**
- No LOVs to collect feedback for us
- But they are ready to answer questions
- Need targeting communications w/simple images to help Call Center conversations. The homepage is changing, but all the tools are the same, and you won't have to manage 2 versions of health tools (no more Vets.gov health tools).
- Not a blocker, but need 13818 to be complete quickly

- Anything that's in context (for example: https://staging.va.gov/disability-benefits/apply/form-526-disability-claim/introduction) we want the specific number that relates to that context, AND the MyVA311 number. So if there's a question about filling out the form, HRC can help with that. And we can also include the MyVA311 number so it's globally available. And then for GI Bill tool, there's the specific GI Bill number AND the MyVA311 number.

**Messaging to internal VA community: ready**

**Messaging to Digital Modernization Community: ready**

**Are there too many things broken: ready.**

**Dashboard: ready.**
- Still want UAT though

**Login / SSO: not ready**
- BUT....
- Pop-up blocker issue, no short term fix but there are things we might be able to look into around the way the screen looks if the pop-up is  blocked. Not a short term couple of day thing though.
- Bigger problem about how our SSO works today: session doesn't get destroyed if logout happens on MHV side. Trying to figure out complications - is this a launch blocker? Session timeout is 30 min.
- Need estimates on a fix to be able to make a decision.
- Need estimates on reverting back to non SSO if ^ is too much time.

**Teamsite header/footer injection: ready.**

**Vets.gov Banner: ready.**

**Fallback option: ready.**
- Anyone can recommend that we do this to Chris, but Chris will make ultimate decision
- Uses a single value stored in build settings, and can update w/o a deployment cycle to update the text in the banner and the link.
