#### Nov 7:

**10 AM: Go / No Go**

In order to create the smoothest launch environment, it is beneficial to establish clear launch criteria early.  This allows the team to the most simple decisions possible.  We propose the follow critiera must be met in order to launch:
- 5,000 users in beta
- Representative of 85% diverse users (across browser types, login types, account types, tool types) have interacted with the site, and there are no unacceptable trends in Google Analytics, performance data, call center reports, user feedback submissions, or social media buzz.
- 100% of www.va.gov traffic is flowing to production VAEC
- AWS is ready for exepected traffic
