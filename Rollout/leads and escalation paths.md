## Rules of Engagement for Escalation during Oct 9 - Nov 9

Alex, Paul, Curtis, James travel to NSOC in WV to meet team and establish working relationships.

On call escalation contacts may not be fully available due to Ad Hoc retreat and the full day DSVA workshops. Call Rachael Roueche if there is a true emergency.

### Oct 18 - Nov 4

On call escalation contacts will be responsive during a broader range of hours (7 days a week, 9 AM ET - 9 PM ET) via the cell phone to support emergencies.

### Nov 5 - 9

On call escalation contacts will be responsive at all hours via cell phone as needed to support emergency pre-launch, launch, and post-launch needs.

**OIT / NSOC meeting**
- Do not push layout changes after this
- Do not adjust for lower traffic, in case we need to deploy config update and pipe back to you
- Do not change anything without talking to the new va.gov team


#### Nov 7:

**10 AM: Go / No Go**

In order to create the smoothest launch environment, it is beneficial to establish clear launch criteria early.  This allows the team to the most simple decisions possible.  We propose the follow critiera must be met in order to launch:
- 5,000 users in beta
- Representative of 85% diverse users (across browser types, login types, account types, tool types) have interacted with the site, and there are no unacceptable trends in Google Analytics, performance data, call center reports, user feedback submissions, or social media buzz.
- 100% of www.va.gov traffic is flowing to production VAEC
- AWS is ready for exepected traffic
