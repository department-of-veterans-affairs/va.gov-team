## ðŸŽ¯ Product Overview

### Executive Summary

The Decision Reviews product enables Veterans to file for reviews and appeals of VA claim decisions through self-service digital forms on VA.gov. As of 2023, all decision review forms are available online, marking a major milestone in digital transformation.

**Our Forms:**
- **VA Form 20-0995:** Supplemental Claim (SC)
- **VA Form 20-0996:** Higher-Level Review (HLR)  
- **VA Form 10182:** Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)

### Product Vision & Strategy

**Vision:** Transform Decision Reviews from individual forms into a personalized experience that rivals the value Veterans get from VSOs and accredited representatives.

**Current Focus Areas:**
1. **Stability** - Ensuring reliable form submission and processing
2. **Transaction Growth** - Increasing digital adoption over paper forms
3. **Personalization** - Creating a holistic, user-centered experience
