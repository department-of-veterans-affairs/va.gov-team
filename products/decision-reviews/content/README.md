# 📝 Content Request Ticket Template

This repository holds the [**Content Request Ticket Template**](products/claim-appeal-status/content/content-ticket-template.md) for use across the Cross Benefits Decision Reviews (DR) and Benefits Management Tools teams 1 & 2 (BMT 1 & BMT 2). The template is designed to standardize intake, ensure the content designer has what they need to begin work and support clear prioritization in the shared [Content board](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/1720/views/1).

## 🔍 Purpose

This template helps teams request content support in a structured way that aligns with:
- VA.gov’s Design System and content strategy
- Sprint planning and team capacity tracking
- Collaboration with VA Content + IA, a11y, design, and engineering teams

By using this format, we ensure the content team can scope, prioritize, and begin work efficiently.
