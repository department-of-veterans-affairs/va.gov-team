## Product context 

The Decision Reviews forms on VA.gov serve as the avenue for Veterans to formally disagree with a VA benefit or claim decision. Veterans can choose between 3 decision review options, (Supplemental Claims, Higher-level Review, or Board Appeal). If for any reason a Veteran is not satisfied with the results of the first option they choose, they can try another one of the options.

Initially started to try and track Veteran interaction with static Decision Review static pages to get insight on the types of information Veterans are looking for to inform the enhanced onramp initiative, but itâ€™s currently tracking unrelated VA.gov static pages, rendering it useless for our initial purpose.
