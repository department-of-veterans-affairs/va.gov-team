When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro:

Intro - 5 minutes
-----------------

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Christian and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. 

Today we're going to talk about Board Appeals (also called Notice of Disagreement). When a veteran chooses this option, they are appealing to a Veterans Law Judge at the Board of Veterans' Appeals in Washington, D.C. A judge who's an expert in Veterans law will review their case.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

-   This entire session should take up to 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

-   In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet veterans' needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

-   Looking at these websites, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

-   If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

-   Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete the analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

-   If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

Start recording.

-   I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
-----------------------------

Before we look at the website, let's start with a few warm-up questions.

-   Can you tell me a little about yourself or your service history?

-   Have you used the VA.gov website before?

-   If yes, what was the last thing you were doing or looking for on the site?

-   How was that experience?

-   Have you ever tried to file a claim for a disability with the VA? 

-   If yes, how was that experience?

-   Have you ever filed an appeal on a decision you received from the VA?

-   If yes, how was that experience?

-   Lets take a look at the prototype now. Since this is a prototype, some buttons and features will work, some will not.  

Task 1: [Request a Board appeal]:
---------------------------------

Imagine that you have logged in to VA.gov and you have navigated to this page (Board Appeals Info page) because you disagree with a decision VA has made about one or more issues you have submitted a claim for.

Starting on this page, please walk me through how you would request a Board Appeal (also called Notice of disagreement). Please tell me what you see on each page, what you think the purpose of it is and what you would do on the page. (It is helpful if you think out loud, so I can follow what you are thinking, trying to do, and experiencing). 

Board Appeals info page

Things to watch for:

-   Does the participant understand the meaning of the 3 different Board Appeal Options?

-   Does the participant notice by themselves the Request a board appeal button?

-   Is there any information missing on this page?

Imagine that you see only half of the issues you have previously registered, on this page. What would you think and do? 

Imagine now that you want to make a Board Appeal for 2 issues: let's say for Tinnitus and Arthritis (in your left ankle). Let's assume you have all the info and documents at hand to make a Board Appeal.

### Things to watch for:

-   Do they understand how to add one or more issues to appeal?

-   Do they by themselves, notice and click on the 'Why can't I see my issue' link?

Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes
---------------------------------

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
