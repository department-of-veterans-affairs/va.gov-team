Research Plan for a Usability test of Board Appeals (NOD)
=========================================================

VSA Claims & Appeals Team, Board Appeals (NOD), Christian Valla, March 2021.

Background
----------

This is a usability test of NOD (Notice Of Disagreement, also called a Board Appeal). 

As a veteran, I should fill out and submit a Notice of Disagreement if I have received a decision from a local VA office or a higher-level adjudicator with which I disagree, and I would like one or more issues to be decided by a Veterans Law Judge. 

I can choose to appeal all or only some of the issues previously decided, however, ONLY those issues that I list on my Notice of Disagreement will be considered.

Previously NOD has only existed as a paper form:

<https://www.va.gov/vaforms/va/pdf/VA10182.pdf>

NOD is a new product. A comprehensive usability test with actual veterans is needed. 

Goals
-----

-   To understand the current user experience, what usability issues exist, including confusing or unclear content/copy. 

-   Is the flow easy to understand and do participants have all the info they need?

-   Do participants feel that an adequate amount of information is presented?

-   Can participants go through the flow by themselves, without blockers or problems? 

Research questions
------------------

Overall:

-   What usability issues exist within the flow? 

-   Are participants able to successfully navigate to and through the form? 

-   What deviations exist from the anticipated happy path of the form and why?  

-   What kinds of frustrations and usability issues do participants experience throughout the flow? Do patterns exist? Why? 

-   Can participants successfully complete the flow without assistance from the moderator? 

-   Is the content and copy across NOD clear and concise? 

-   Is there ambiguity or confusion experienced by the participants within any of the pages within the NOD form? 

-   Do the participants feel that they have all the information they need to complete the NOD flow?

-   What is most helpful for the participants throughout the flow?

-   What is most confusing or unclear for the participants in the NOD form?

-   What part of the NOD form is most frustrating or difficult for the participants to complete?

-   Do participants feel that they are asked about the appropriate level of details?

-   Are the participants uncomfortable with any questions? If so, why?

-   If they could change one thing within this experience, what would it be?

Details:

-   NOD intro page: Is anything here confusing or unclear for the participants? 

-   Contact info page: is anything here confusing or unclear? 

-   Board review options: do users understand the purpose of this page?

-   Do users understand the terms used on this page? 

-   Is anything here confusing or unclear? 

-   Do users feel that they have all the information they need in order to make this decision?

-   Specific issues to be appealed page: 

-   Is anything on this page confusing or unclear? 

-   Do users understand the terms used on this page? (Example: adjudicated issues)

-   Do users feel that they have all the information they need in order to make fill out this page?

-   Opt-In from SOC/SSOC checkmark: Do users understand what they are actually doing when they decide to check / not check this box? 

-   Do users understand what "legacy appeals/legacy appeals process" means? 

-   Do they understand the full ramifications of this choice? 

-   Overall impressions of the form.

-   Other comments. 

Method
------

-   We will be conducting a remote, moderated usability study with 8 Veterans (separated from active duty).

-   We will test a prototype of the NOD form: (link here) (Invision).

-   Allowing users to interact with a prototype of the NOD form, on their own, in their own environment, can help us detect usability issues they encounter, in a test situation that is as close as possible to a real user experience.

-   We will use Zoom to conduct these sessions.

-   We will ask Veterans to navigate to the Invision prototype (a link provided in the Zoom chat) and have participants share their screen with us via Zoom.

-   We will ask the participants to go through the NOD form from its beginning to its end. 

-   We will ask participants to speak out loud as they move through the form, and probe for usability issues and relevant feedback. 

-   Pre-test interview: probe into what pain points, frustrations remain in the form and how they can be removed. 

Participants and Recruitment
----------------------------

We would like to interview 8 participants.

-   In order to get 8 participants, we would like Perigean to schedule 13 participants total, with the expectation that there will be a max of 5 no-shows.

-   For the participant's Perigean recruits:

Primary criteria / Must have: 

-   All Participants must be Veterans (separated from active duty). 

-   All participants must have submitted a claim or an appeal with the VA at some point.

-   ⅔ of participants have submitted an appeal with VA at some point.

-   ⅓ of participants have not submitted an appeal with VA.

-   Participants must be able to use Zoom, locate and use the chat function in Zoom, and share their screen through Zoom.

-   Must be willing to and able to interact with an Invision prototype and provide feedback on this experience. 

-   Must be on a computer with a stable internet connection.

Secondary criteria / Would like to have: 

-   Participants should be able to describe to the researcher what they are trying to accomplish, what they are experiencing, and what they are thinking, as they are interacting with VA.gov.

-   50% women, 50% men.

-   50% identify as an ethnicity/race other than Caucasian.

-   At least 1 participant 35 or under and 1 participant over 55.

-   At least 1 participant without a college degree.
