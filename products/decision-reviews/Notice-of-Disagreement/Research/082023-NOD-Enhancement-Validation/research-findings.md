## **Background**

Veterans can file a request for a board appeal if they are dissatisfied or disagree with a VA decision on their benefits claim in hopes of receiving a higher benefits rating. Following release in April 2022, The Request for Board Appeal online form was released in April 2022. A post-launch [evaluative study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/decision-reviews/Notice-of-Disagreement/Research/042023%20NoD%20Evaluative%20Research/research-findings.md) led to the following proposed enhancements:

### Context and Expectation-Setting Enhancements
- Enhancements to the form introduction page facilitating validation of their chosen decision pathway
- Language clarifying deadlines for submission and definition of contested claims

### Issue Selection and Disagreement Explanation Enhancements
- Links to claimant decision letters facilitating issue selection and entry
- Population of contention details facilitating the selection of reasons for disagreement
- Additional language clarifying the intent of the reason for disagreement field
- Additional form elements to gather context surrounding the appeal

### Navigational and Task Flow Related Enhancements
- Simplified form headers and task list facilitating task orientation and form navigation ([experimental ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-design-system-documentation/issues/1326))
- Simplified form review page facilitating validation of form data ahead of submission ([research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsp/teams/pst-forms-library/research/review-page-round-two/Review%20Page%20Research%20Round%202.pdf))

## BVA Priorities

We are working with the Board of Veterans Appeals to discover ways we can help meet the following goals:
- Each Veteran's appeal is timely docketed and tracked throughout the appeals process
- Each Veteran receives a timely hearing by a Veterans Law Judge upon request
- Each Veteran receives a timely decision on his/her appeal

## Veteran Journey

Services and products coming out of this effort would support the following
phases of a veteran's journey: Taking Care of Myself, Retiring, Aging and
Putting down roots, specifically engaging VA to access benefits and services in
the [Veteran Journey Map](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)

## **Research Goals**
Gather feedback surrounding the relevance, usability and comparative user value
of proposed enhancements.

### Enhancement Hypothesis and Desired Product Outcomes

**Enhanced Context and Expectation-Setting**
> We believe that providing Veterans **information and access points about
> different DR options in the form instruction page will decrease early
> drop-offs (false starts)**. Secondarily, this may increase the relevance of
>   analytics in evaluating form usability.

**Access to Decision letters and Contention Rating Information**
> We believe that providing Veterans **access to decision letters and contention
> rating details within the form will increase Veteran\'s confidence and
> completion rate** of submissions.

**Additional Context Regarding Submission**
>   We believe that providing Veterans **an area in the form to provide
> additional context surrounding their submission will decrease late form drop
> off % and increase digital form submission %**.

## Outcomes

Research findings will be used to validate the readiness of enhancements for
development and release. Comparative user value and desirability of enhancements
will be used to inform prioritization for development and release.

## **Methodology**

Moderated interview and concept evaluation of enhanced Board Appeal form clickable prototype.

## **Research Questions**

Gather feedback surrounding the relevance of usability of proposed enhancements

**Context and Expectation-Setting Enhancements**
- How well are Veterans able to orient and comprehend what's presented in the revised instructional pages?
- How well does content line up against Veteran expectations and support Veterans in validating their chosen decision pathway?

**Issue Selection and Disagreement Enhancements**
- To what extent is access to decision letters and details surrounding contention decisions valuable in facilitating the selection and entry of issues for disagreement?
- Are Veterans able to locate where to enter additional context and explanation for their reason for disagreement?

**Navigational and Task Flow Enhancements**
- How well are Veterans able to comprehend, orient, and operate enhanced form navigation controls?
- What value does the task list and enhanced submission review pages provide Veterans?

**Enhancement User Value and Desirability**
- Between the various enhancements proposed (revised instructional page, inclusion of issue details, enhanced navigation, and enhanced review page), which enhancements stand to have the greatest impact in bolstering Veteran confidence with their appeal submission? Why?

### **Context and Expectation-Setting Enhancements**

> We believe that providing Veterans information and access points about different DR options in the form instruction page will decrease early drop-offs (false starts). Secondarily, this may increase the relevance of analytics in evaluating form usability.

  **More investigation needed**
  
  Information about decision pathways support Learners in validating the chosen decision review path, but more information is needed to sufficiently support this use case.

  Doers preferred the original version. The additional information provided overwhelmed them. It is inconclusive what impact that might have on this segment of Veterans. 

  The additional context surrounding the appeal process steps did not satisfy Learners in providing insight into filing requirements. Many Learners wanted to click through items in the task list to delve more deeply into each step of the submission process.

### **Issue Selection and Disagreement Enhancements**

> We believe that Veterans will be able to identify where to provide additional information about their appeal and differentiate those fields from fields relating to reason for disagreement.

  **Inconclusive**

  The inclusion of contention rating details in the reason for disagreement screens did not stand out much for Veterans, but we also did not evaluate the counterfactual case. It’s unclear how beneficial this information may be. Most of the Veterans we spoke to kept their decision letters in their personal records, negating the benefit of a link to the DLD page. Even so, neither of these enhancements hindered Veterans in the appeals flow.

> We believe that providing Veterans an area in the form to provide additional context surrounding their submission will decrease late form drop off % and increase digital form submission %.

  **True**

  Most Veterans we spoke with expressed the desire to supply additional information for their claim. More work is needed to clarify the intent surrounding reasons for disagreement, additional information, and additional evidence (in cases where additional evidence is relevant).

### **Navigational and Task Flow Enhancements**

> We believe Veterans will find the enhanced navigation comprehensible and usable.

  **Partially True**

  Veterans found the header to be comprehensible. Comprehension of the Task list was mixed. It’s worth noting that the task list we employed did not display the status for each step of the appeals flow. This may have been cause for gaps in Veteran comprehension.

> We believe Veterans will find the enhanced review page to be comprehensible and usable.

  **False**

  The majority of the Veterans were thrown off by being sent back to the beginning of each section and had difficulty navigating to specific prompts to revise. Returning to the review page was also cumbersome.

## **Key Findings**

1. Veterans seem to sort cleanly into two groups — learners and doers. For some, more information is more.  For others, the opposite is true.
2. Veteran comprehension of decision reviews and appeals vary. Many do not know what is most relevant for their claim.
3. Veterans are unconfident in what they can submit to support their claim.
4. Veterans demonstrated confusion between reason for disagreement, additional information and additional evidence (where relevant).

## **Details of Findings**

### **Finding 1**

Veterans seem to sort cleanly into two groups — learners and doers. For some, more information is more. For others, the opposite is true.

Different claimants approach the claim process differently.  Learners are inclined to thoroughly investigate before pursuing their appeal. Doers want a single place to file and wish for the filing experience to be more directive.

* Learners tend to prefer the enhanced introduction page
* Doers preferred the original version

> I would google all terms… get all the forms and print it all out. Down to the section number. Figure out my angle of attack. - P12

> And this is where you get stuck. You know, It’s  just like, where do I go? You read through 900 pages of war and peace just get more and more confused. You start clicking down 19 different rabbit holes and then  and then nobody knows what to do. What's the highway? You know, this is taking me off into different forks in the road all the time. I want to get to my destination. I want to head south. - P13

### **Finding 2**

Veteran comprehension of decision reviews and appeals vary. Many do not know what is most relevant for their claim.

Claimants vary in their knowledge of decision pathways as well as how claims are adjudicated. More information is needed to sufficiently support Veterans in validating their chosen decision pathway.
* Veterans want to know how long each decision review and review option will take and the intent of each option
* Some think of appeals strictly regarding issues that have been denied
* Despite revisions to clarify, Veterans continue to find language surrounding contested claims and legacy appeals vague
* Even in being provided a preview of appeal steps, claimants will want to dig into specific form pages to better understand submission requirements

> I see higher level review. I see, you know, supplemental claim. But you know, maybe a better explanation is… what's the why, You know. Why I should go down a particular path? What’s the rationale behind it — the purpose, would be helpful. - P6

> You know, there's a lot of legal speak here. You’re just putting, you know, nonsense on here. What you're doing here is just putting roadblocks up! I’m reading through all this confusing information that doesn't even apply to me. - P13

> Whatever they deny, that's, that's the issue. The ones that have already been granted we don't need to look at again. - P13


### **Finding 3**

Veterans are unconfident in what they can submit to support their claim.

Veterans are unconfident in what they can submit to support their claim, particularly in the case that they’ve already submitted all the evidence they have on hand or have challenges in obtaining viable evidence.

* Several Veterans spoke to lost and missing records being a common phenomenon
* The desire for the most compelling and relevant narrative to supply alongside their appeal is a reason Veterans shy away from self-filing and rely on VSOs to support them in the process

> I would try to get my medical records from when I was in service, but I know that's pretty hard because a lot of Vietnam Veteran service records were destroyed in a fire in Saint Louis. -P7

> I was in the Marine Corps. They lost my stuff. And it's like, I made some copies. I didn't make all of them, but I made some. And so when I submitted it, it wasn't, it wasn't looked at. And that's when the VA says, "Oh, there's no proof of it." That's when you pull your hair out. -P12

> I think that's why I went with the DAV. They’re a little bit more up on this stuff than I am. I think he knows the words to use that might sway the judge. 
> 
> It's like anything else. Certain words click. It's good to have someone who understands the language to be able to speak to the law judge. They might say the right thing for you to win your appeal. You know what I'm saying? -P13

### **Finding 4**

Veterans demonstrated confusion between reason for disagreement, additional information and additional evidence.

Some wished to supply additional context for each issue in the reason for disagreement screen. Some interpreted additional information as a place to add additional evidence. These Veterans were surprised to see “submit more evidence” as a Board Review Option. 
* Most Veterans we spoke with expressed the desire to supply additional information for their claim. 
* Several Veterans found the separation of text area and file upload for additional information to be cumbersome — the ability to upload was frequently overlooked

> So additional information. Okay, I would assume it's gonna ask for New evidence. -P9

> It's like, submit more evidence? That's kind of what we were doing now. Submit more? I just submitted more. It just seems like there's a disconnect there. -P10

> [regarding reason for disagreement] I wanna say this is for  further evidence. Basically If you have anything else new to tell the VA about this particular issue. -P8

## **Additional Findings**

1. Some Veterans decide to self-file due to sensitive information in their claim file and stigma relating to military sexual trauma.
2. Many Veterans file appeals thinking that the VA has dismissed contentions they’ve filed, not knowing that the VA renders decisions as they arrive at them rather than across each claim as a whole.
3. Some of what’s driving the propensity to “do” is the concern of getting lost in VA.gov and not being able path back to the area to file the appeal.
4. The enhanced header and was universally understood by veterans and appreciated. 
5. Response to the task list was mixed. Comprehension varied widely — many thought of the task list as informational. “Doers” tended to be overwhelmed by what they saw, while “Learners” expressed wanting to open every link to dive into the specifics of the appeals flow. Those who used the task list for navigation did so extensively.
6. Response to the enhanced review page was poor. Veterans were thrown off by being sent to the beginning of each section upon clicking on “edit” and expressed wanting to be able to edit responses to specific prompts directly. Upon making revisions, Veterans manually stepped through the form to return to the review page.

## **Recommendations**

**NEAR TERM PRODUCT IMPLICATIONS**
1. Consider revisiting the task flow of the appeals process to allow for greater logical separation across steps the flow (particularly around reasons for disagreement, additional information, and additional evidence).
2. Consider exploring ways to dynamically address appeal requirements around eligibility, deadlines, and extension requests based on information in the Veteran claim file.

⠀**BROADER SERVICE / PRODUCT IMPLICATIONS**
1. Consider developing a universal entry point for filing decision reviews / appeals
2. Consider cultivating a more robust set of information disclosure patterns to enable learning in place
3. Consider simplifying information pathways between learning about appeals and decision reviews and submitting them.
