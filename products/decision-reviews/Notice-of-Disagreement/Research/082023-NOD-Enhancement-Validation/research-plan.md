VA BENEFITS Â· CE Decision Review # Research Plan for NOD Enhancement Validation
# Research Plan for NOD Enhancement Validation, September 2023

During post-launch evaluation of the Board Appeal form, the decision reviews
team identified the following post-release enhancements to improve form
usability and effectiveness. This effort seeks to validate the relevance,
usability, and desirability of proposed enhancements.

## Background

Veterans can file a request for a board appeal if they are dissatisfied or
disagree with a VA decision on their benefits claim in hopes of receiving a
higher benefits rating. Following release in April 2022, a post-launch [evaluative
study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/decision-reviews/Notice-of-Disagreement/Research/042023%20NoD%20Evaluative%20Research/research-findings.md) was conducted, leading to the following proposed enhancements:

### Context and Expectation-Setting Enhancements

- Enhancements to the form introduction page facilitating validation of their
chosen decision pathway
- Language clarifying deadlines for submission and definition of contested
claims

### Issue Selection and Disagreement Explanation Enhancements

- Links to claimant decision letters facilitating issue selection and entry
- Population of contention details facilitating the selection of reasons for
disagreement
- Additional language clarifying the intent of the reason for disagreement field
- Additional form elements to gather context surrounding the appeal

### Navigational and Task Flow Related Enhancements

- Simplified form headers and task list facilitating task orientation and form
navigation ([experimental
ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-design-system-documentation/issues/1326))
- Simplified form review page facilitating validation of form data ahead of
submission
([research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsp/teams/pst-forms-library/research/review-page-round-two/Review%20Page%20Research%20Round%202.pdf))

## BVA Priorities

We are working with the Board of Veterans Appeals to discover ways we can help
meet the following goals:

- Each Veteran's appeal is timely docketed and tracked throughout the appeals
process
- Each Veteran receives a timely hearing by a Veterans Law Judge upon request
- Each Veteran receives a timely decision on his/her appeal

## Veteran Journey

Services and products coming out of this effort would support the following
phases of a veteran's journey: Taking Care of Myself, Retiring, Aging and
Putting down roots, specifically engaging VA to access benefits and services in
the [Veteran Journey
Map](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)

## Research Goals

Gather feedback surrounding the relevance, usability and comparative user value
of proposed enhancements.

### Enhancement Hypothesis and Desired Product Outcomes

**Enhanced Context and Expectation-Setting**
> We believe that providing Veterans **information and access points about
> different DR options in the form instruction page will decrease early
>   drop-offs (false starts)**. Secondarily, this may increase the relevance of
>   analytics in evaluating form usability.

**Access to Decision letters and Contention Rating Information**
> We believe that providing Veterans **access to decision letters and contention
>   rating details within the form will increase Veteran\'s confidence and
>   completion rate** of submissions.

**Additional Context Regarding Submission**
>   We believe that providing Veterans **an area in the form to provide
>   additional context surrounding their submission will decrease late form drop
>   off % and increase digital form submission %**.

## Outcomes

Research findings will be used to validate the readiness of enhancements for
development and release. Comparative user value and desirability of enhancements
will be used to inform prioritization for development and release.

## Research questions

Gather feedback surrounding the relevance of usability of proposed enhancements

**Context and Expectation-Setting Enhancements**

>   - How well are Veterans able to orient and comprehend what's presented in the
>     revised instructional pages?
>   - How well does content line up against Veteran expectations and support Veterans in validating their chosen decision pathway?

**Issue Selection and Disagreement Enhancements**

>   - To what extent is access to decision letters and details surrounding contention decisions valuable in facilitating the selection and entry of issues for disagreement?
>   - Are Veterans able to locate where to enter additional context and explanation for their reason for disagreement?

**Navigational and Task Flow Enhancements**

>   - How well are Veterans able to comprehend, orient, and operate enhanced form navigation controls?
>   - What value does the task list and enhanced submission review pages provide Veterans?

**Enhancement User Value and Desirability**

>   - Between the various enhancements proposed (revised instructional page,
>     inclusion of issue details, enhanced navigation, and enhanced review page),
>     which enhancements stand to have the greatest impact in bolstering Veteran
>     confidence with their appeal submission? Why?

## Hypotheses and Assumptions

**Context and Expectation-Setting Enhancements**

- We believe that Veterans have inconsistent and incomplete knowledge of decision review pathways prior to pursuing a specific pathway.
- We believe there is value in providing additional context around decision pathways at the start of the appeals process.
- We believe the revised instructional page will help facilitate the validation of the selected decision review pathway.

**Issue Selection and Disagreement Enhancements**

- We believe that not all Veterans know they are able to access decision letters through va.gov.
- Veterans may need help locating information surrounding specific
contention decisions within their decision letters.
- We believe that Veterans will be able to identify where to provide additional
information about their appeal and differentiate those fields from fields
relating to reason for disagreement.

**Navigational and Task Flow Enhancements**

- We believe Veterans will find the enhanced navigation comprehensible and usable.
- We believe Veterans will find the enhanced review page to be comprehensible and usable.

## Recruitment

### Recruitment approach

We will recruit participants using a variant of the maximum variation sampling strategy. Our goal is to emphasize underrepresented veterans in past research. We desire to surface new insights that may not be obvious as a result of studying our usual groups. We will use Perigean's recruiting service to schedule 18 interviews to achieve 12 completed sessions.

### Recruitment criteria

**Primary criteria (must-haves) Our target audience for this research is Veterans who have had their claims denied and are considering to make a Board Appeal request.**

-   All participants must be Veterans.
-   All participants must have a computer or tablet and be willing to complete
    their session using one of those devices.
-   All participants must have Zoom installed on their devices before the
    session and be able to share screen or view screen-shared content.
