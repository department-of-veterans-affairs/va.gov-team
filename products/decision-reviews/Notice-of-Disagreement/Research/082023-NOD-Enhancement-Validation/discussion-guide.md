## Starting the session

    consent to having observers in the session. Tell them to have their camera
    on with full name displayed for a brief introduction to the participant when
    they are admitted to the session.
-   In the Attendees section, ensure everyone except the participant is on mute.
-   In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is
    unchecked.
-   Check your screen sharing setup and share permissions for participants.
-   When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro.

## Intro (5 minutes)

Thanks for joining me today. My name is Ruben. I'm part of a team working on the
portion of VA.gov used for submitting benefit decision reviews.

Just to provide a little background, we're holding a series of conversations
with Veterans who are in the process of considering or pursuing a Board Appeal
to get a better understanding of the Veteran experience of the process, and your
needs as a claimant in the process.

Before we start, there are a few things I want to mention: I have some
colleagues in the waiting room who would like to observe and take notes.
Perigean may have mentioned this, but I wanted to confirm with you before we got
started. Are you okay with my colleagues joining us for this session?

**Participant does not consent**
> Excuse observers from the meeting via Slack.

**Participant consents**
> Let other observers into the room and allow a short pause for short
introductions. For those of you who just joined, can you want to come off-camera briefly to introduce yourselves? Thanks!

This session should take about one hour. To ensure we're able to touch on all
the topics we're hoping to cover, I may occasionally prompt you to keep the
conversation on track.

During this session, we want to hear your open and honest opinions. Anything you
share will be taken as feedback for the claims process and VA website. We're not
here to evaluate you. Along those lines, if there's any reason you want to stop the 
session, please let me know. Likewise, if there are any topics or questions you 
prefer not to answer, let me know, and I can move the conversation along from there.
You'll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete.

Perigean may have shared, but we'll be reviewing a software prototype of a
a potential future version of the board appeal form to gather feedback from you. 
So, some of it might not feel familiar to you.

One last thing. Are you comfortable if I record the screen and audio as we talk
today? We capture these recordings to ensure we're able to capture your opinions
accurately. Recordings are deleted after we complete analysis, and none of the
comments from the recordings will be attached to your name.

> **If yes:**
> Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me
> recording this session once more.
> < Start recording >.
> I have started recording.
> Just to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we
> talk today?

## Warm-up (5 minutes)

***Goal: Gather context about the participant's claim context and location in
the appeal journey.***

To get us started, I wanted to ask you a few questions:

-   Do you currently have a claim you're considering pursuing a decision review
or appeal for? (They should)
-   How far along are you in the process of deciding to pursue a decision review
or appeal?
-   Have you filed a digital form on VA.gov before?
< If yes > Which one?

#### Navigate to the Board Appeal Form

Let's transition to looking at some of our in-progress work on a potential
future version of the board appeal form on VA.gov.

What we'll be looking at is a prototype, so not everything will work as it would usually and we'll be using mock data form a fictitious Veteran scenario, but hopefully, we'll be able to get some good input from you as we go.

 I'm going to share my screen. Once it's up, I'll hand over control of my mouse 
cursor. From here, you should be able to explore.

## Task 1. Review Form Instructions (10 mins)

***Goal: Evaluate if Veterans are able to orient around what's presented in
instructional pages and how comprehensible and valuable the content is, identify
gaps***

#### Orientation and Comprehension

-   Help me understand what you're seeing on this page. What do you think this
page is for?
-   How is the content on the page organized?

#### Content Value and Usefulness

**Probe expectations, usefulness, gaps**

-   Is this content you would engage in typically? Why or why not?
-   Is this the kind of content you would expect to show up on a page like this?
-   From your perspective, how useful is the content presented on this page?
-   Anything you'd expect to see that you're not seeing? What's missing?
-   From your perspective, how well does the content on these pages support you confirming that the decision review option you've selected is the right option for you?

#### Comparison Proposed Version with the Original Version

Taking a pause from the prototype. I'd like you to take a look at these two
versions.
- Which do you prefer and why?

Let's move on. 
How would you continue with pursuing the appeal?

## Task 2. Validate Comprehension of Task List Pattern and Heading Navigation (5 mins)

***Goal: Validate user comprehension of task list pattern.***

#### Task List

- Take a look at this screen and help me understand what you think this page is
for.
- Go ahead and continue.

#### Contact Information

For now, let's just imagine that everything that the VA has about your contact
information is correct. Go ahead and continue.

- What do you think the information written at the top of the page represents?

**Validate comprehension of heading navigation components**
- If you wanted to go back to the previous question, where would you go?
- If you wanted to go back to see all the steps to file an appeal where would you go?
- Go ahead and give it a try.
- What do you see yourself doing with this list? Why?

\< Click through Veteran Information, Request Deadline Extension, VA Healthcare  \>

-OR

We're actually going to skip ahead through a few of these sections. 
Can you navigate to Select Issues for me?

## Task 3. Select Issues (5 Mins)

***Goal: Evaluate value in facilitating issue selection.***

- What do you think this section is about?
- For your claim, do you know what issues you want the VA to review?
How are you able to identify which issues are most relevant?
\[ Listen for the role of decision letters, probe as necessary \]
- Suppose, for whatever reason, you didn't see the issue you wanted to select
listed. What would you do?
- Go ahead and scan through this page and help me understand what's on this
page.

For the sake of this review, go ahead and select \[ Tinnitus and Headaches \] and continue.

## Task 4. Select reason for disagreement (10 mins)

- Walk me through what you're seeing on this page.
- I know you don't have the details you might need to determine what to select here, but I would be curious
what you're thinking as you're looking at what's listed on this page.

\[ Listen for thought process in reviewing issue disagreement specifics 
Watch out for reactions to "other field" Probe as necessary \]

Let's go ahead and move on. Select \[ Service Connection and rating, respectively ] and continue.

## Task 5. Capture Additional Explanation and Review (5 mins)

**Capture Additional Explanation**

- Go ahead and take a look at what's on this page and help me understand what this section is about.
- For your own claim, what shape does the explanation take?
  [ Listen for attachments, written statements, additional documentation ]

Let's move on.

**Review Option** For the purpose of today's review, select direct review and
continue.

**Review**
- Help me understand what this page is for.
- Where do you expect to happen if you click on where it says edit?

## Bonus Topic: Receive Decision & Explore Options (10 mins)

While I've got you here, I wanted to learn more about the context of your decision review or appeal.

- How would you describe your familiarity with decision reviews or benefits
appeals overall? Have you gone through any decision reviews or appeals
previously?
- What's informing the path you're thinking to pursue?
[ probe research, consulting peers and experts, receiving support ]
- Can you currently share a little about your history with that particular claim
or set of claims?
- How did you arrive at pursuing a decision review?

## Closing Questions (8 mins)

Today we looked at a few enhancements the board appeal form does not currently
have. I wanted to have you weigh in on them.

- What were your overall impressions of what you saw today?
- Between the revised instructional page, enhanced navigation, inclusion of
issue details, and enhanced review page, which enhancement stands to have the
greatest impact in bolstering your confidence with their appeal submission? Why?

**Probe prioritization**

- What would you consider to be a "must have's"?
- What would you consider to be "nice to have"?
- Are there any enhancements you don't find to be useful?
- If you were filing this form on your own, how else could we make this process
easier?

## Thank-You and Closing: 2 minutes

That's all we had for you today. Thank you so much. This has been super helpful.
We appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us.

Before we close, do you have any questions or last thoughts for me before we end
the session?

## Emergency Exit

**Out of questions:** We have covered all the questions I have for you today.
Thank you so much for your time and feedback. Despite ending early, you will be
compensated for this session.

**Technology Issue:** I am so sorry, but the website is unexpectedly not working
properly. I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your time. Despite
ending early, you will be compensated for this session.

**Backup Moderator:** This is best to practice beforehand, but can work if there
is an emergency with the moderator. Appoint another team member who will be on
the call as the backup moderator. You can say "for the next part of this session
Gary/Ruben will moderate." They should be prepared to jump in if something
happens to you or you are not comfortable to finish the session.
