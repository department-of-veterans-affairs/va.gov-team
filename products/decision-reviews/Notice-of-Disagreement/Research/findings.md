Research Goals
--------------

-   What usability issues and pain points exist in the Board Appeals prototype?

-   Can users go through the form with ease and no blockers?

-   Is there any confusion with regards to language and terms used? 

-   Do participants feel that they have all the information they need in order to complete the form?

Research Methodology
--------------------

We conducted a remote, moderated, task-oriented usability study, using Zoom

-   Participants logged into Zoom with their computer, shared their screen, and opened up the prototype (Invision) for us to observe their interaction.

-   The participants were given tasks to perform within the prototype.

The structure of the study:

-   2 minutes for an introduction.

-   3 minutes for warm-up questions.

-   Approximately 35 minutes with usability tasks and questions

-   5 min for exit questions and wrap-up

### Who we talked to

The participants in this study consisted of 7 veterans:

-   TBD Monday - waiting for a document from Shannon.

### Research Questions

-   What usability issues exist within the flow? 

-   Are participants able to successfully navigate through the form? 

-   Can participants successfully complete the flow without any assistance? 

-   Is the content and copy across the form clear and concise? 

-   Do the participants feel that they have all the information they need in order to complete the form?

-   What is most helpful, confusing, or unclear for the participants throughout the flow?

-   What part of the form is most difficult for the participants to complete?

-   Do participants feel that they are asked the appropriate level of details?

-   Are the participants uncomfortable with any questions? If so, why?

-   If they could improve one thing in the form, what would it be?

Details:

-   Issues eligible for review page: do users understand the terms on this page? Do users feel they have all the info needed in order to make this decision?

-   Opt-In check box and text: Do users understand what they are actually doing when they decide to check / not check this box? 

-   Do users understand what legacy appeals/legacy appeals process means?

-   Do they understand the consequences of this choice? 

-   Overall impressions of the form.

Key Findings
------------

1.  Several participants have  submitted a board appeal before. Their experiences varied from pretty easy to a very frustrating experience that took several years.

2.  Overall participants find the online form easy to navigate. The Veteran details-, Additional evidence-, and Review your request pages are intuitive/self-explanatory. 

3.  Participants are confused by the Opt-in information on the Board Appeals  Info page and on the Issues Eligible for Review page.

4.  A few participants would like to be asked why they are appealing.

5.  Participants are appalled by the processing time for the Board Appeals.

6.  Some key elements are not discoverable enough. A few participants needed prompting to locate the drop-down links (e.g. Why aren't all my issues listed here?).

7.  Participants would be confused and  worried if they did only see some of their issues listed on the Issues Eligible for Review page. They would add their issues not shown, to make sure they were all in the system.

8.  Inconsistent copy about the board review options between the Board Appeals Info page and the Board Review Options page.

9.  Participants would like to upload several/all documents simultaneously.

10. Several participants want to be able to print (and save) the entire form when it is filled out.

Details of Findings
-------------------

### 1. Several participants have  submitted a board appeal before. Their experience varied from pretty easy (with a VSO) to a very frustrating experience that took several years. 

"I have no issues with the law judge, but they don't do it in a timely fashion, having it there since 2014 then having it go back up, it is just sitting on the desk, or sitting in a cabinet until they get to it".

### 2\. Overall participants find the Board Appeals online form easy to navigate. The Veteran details -, Additional evidence -, and the Review your request pages seemed self-explanatory for the participants. 

1.  A few participants were not sure if they would have their representative's email at hand, or would prefer not to leave the form to locate that email.

2.  Two participants suggested providing a definition for VA-accredited attorney or agent.

### 3\. Participants are confused by the Opt-in information on the Board Appeals  Info page and on the Issues Eligible for Review page.

1.  Participants think the following information is lacking: 

1.  what is the difference between the old and the new review process?

"I think maybe it should be something that says that the VA has changed their review process. I think there is a lack of transparency here".

1.  why should they choose the new review process?

2.  what are the actual consequences of their choice? 

1.  Participants are confused about the term legacy appeals process.

"I think I would need to read it 10 times to understand it".

1.  Participants are uncomfortable with copy: ...you are withdrawing any issues you've selected... They are not sure about the consequence of this choice.

"I am not withdrawing any issues, even though it says it will be under the new process. I don't get a warm and fuzzy feeling here, it makes me feel like I am terminating my rights even though when you read further on it will be under the new process".

### 4\. A few participants would like to be asked why they are appealing. They would like to add information about what part of an appeal they are appealing, and why. 

### I need to say something like: "I disagree with the rating. Here's why I disagree and here's whatever information I want to present to justify my disagreement".

### 5\. Participants are  appalled by the processing time for the Board Appeals. They think that one year and more than one year is too long, and would also like more granularity in these time estimates.  

### One year to complete, wow! I think that is disgusting, I could be dead in a year. 

### 6\. Some key elements are not discoverable enough. A few participants needed prompting to locate drop-down links (e.g. Why aren't all my issues listed here?) and two participants (Vietnam-era veterans) needed some time to locate the Request a Board Appeal button.

"It was not clear that it was a link, with the arrow and everything. I looked for the blue color. I also have one eye that doesn't work".

### 7\. Participants would be confused and worried if they did only see some of their issues listed on the Issues Eligible for Review page.

### Multiple participants said that they would add all their issues that were not shown, to make sure that all their issues were registered in the system.

"I don't like it. They should list all issues, even if one is pending. If I submitting it electronically they must have received it. I feel like I needed to add all the issues again since they have not been registered."

1.  One participant worries that if veterans can add any issue, they will potentially list any issue they can think of, and overwhelm the system. 

"If the guys can add any issues that are bothering them, they will gum up the system. There needs to be a system of checks and balances". 

1.  Participants expect all their issues (eligible for an appeal) to be listed.

"If you can list 2 issues, then you can list all of them. I would need to click add issues and add them all in. It seems odd that I need to tell VA the issues on a VA website, you would assume they have all of the information".

1.  The explanation under the link: Why aren't all my issues listed here? is not adequate for some participants.

"...it's kind of a lame excuse! It sounds like the VA doesn't have its act together". 

1.  A few participants worried that not everyone would notice the drop-down link. 

1.  One participant thought there should be a possibility to take action here about this issue (e.g. contact info). 

"This text is informative, but doesn't give me an action. What should I do if I don't see my issue? Maybe there should be a status report or a link to where you can go to see if it is being processed".

### 8\. Inconsistent copy about the board review options between the Board Appeals Info page and the Board Review Options page.

1.  A few participants were confused by the 3 options. Two participants seemed to interpret these as steps in the process, and not options.

2.  A couple of users wanted to see the time estimates also on the Board Review Options page, preferably with more granular time estimates.

"Direct review is the fastest, but the prior pages said each take over a year so that doesn't make any sense. Option B says it takes longer, but I was told earlier that everything takes over a year. You tell me direct review is the quickest and B and C take longer. Before I was told everything takes over a year, I am lost here".

### 9\. Participants would like to upload several / all documents in one go. They assumed that the 25 MB limit for uploading additional evidence is per document. A few participants are worried that they can reach this limit.

Additional evidence page one: "I would highlight the "90 days" and put it in bold print to make sure Veterans understand that. If you don't get it done in 90 days, then you've already lost the battle."

### 10\. Several participants want to be able to print (and save) the entire form (filled out), not only the Submitted page. Being able to check the status of the appeal seems very important for the participants.

"After I close my browser, how can I check the status of my appeal at another time? Information about that would be helpful."

"Checking the status of the appeal is the absolute most important to us."

Recommendations
---------------

-   Change the copy about ...opting into the new process on the Board Appeals Info page: use plain language, simplify language, consider not using legacy appeals process, but instead old and new appeals process. 

-   Consider if the Request a Board Appeal button is noticeable enough.

-   Change copy on button Track the status of your claim to ...appeals.

-   Add a definition (or infobox) for VA-accredited attorney or agent on the Veteran details page.

-   Make the representative's email address optional or remove the question. 

-   Considerations for the Issues eligible for review page: 

-   Consider making the drop-down link Why aren't all my issues listed here more noticeable. 

-   Change the copy of the Opt-in note from Legacy Appeals Process to plain language (e.g. new and old appeal process). Simplify and clarify the copy about the opt-in process, and make it consistent with the copy about the opt-in process on the Board Appeals Info page.

-   Due to the incomplete list of issues eligible for Board Appeal, allow veterans to instead manually add the issues they want to appeal to the board. Caveat: if the list of issues in fact shows most of their issues, keeping the list makes sense (we are waiting for more data on this.)  

-   Tech discovery - can additional data be pulled from VBS, to provide a complete list with all the veteran's issues, whether registered or just pending?  

-   Make the copy on the Board review option page consistent with the Board Appels Info page. Simplify language if possible. Add the time estimates to both pages.

-   Tech discovery: can the time estimates be more granular?

-   Consider allowing veterans to print (and save) the whole completed form.
