# Notice of Disagreement Heuristic Review Topline Summary

December 2022

This is a high-level, top of mind summary of findings from the recent heuristic review to help our team align on the current condition of the experience, potential opportunities, and determine specific directions to pursue.

The review was conducted by [Eva Floyd](mailto:eva.floyd@coforma.io) and [Eileen Chi](mailto:eileen.chi@coforma.io), using the lens of two VA personas: Proud Patriot, and Day by Day Veteran, covering a set of heuristics that can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L6MLFqAnn7FcK4LU4Nh1PCD04lhSZnu84XqHkamEp7E/edit#gid=342521442).

### **Tasks covered in this review**

1. View the status of a disability claim (either online or in a letter), when a disability claim has been denied, or received a lower rating than expected.
2. Chooses Board of Appeal out of 3 review options
3. Decides to apply online, instead physically through mail, in-person, or fax.
4. Reviews steps required for VA Form 10182
5. Decide on board review option: direct review, evidence submission, or hearing with a judge.
6. Completes form (may return to form several times)
7. Reviews and submits form
8. Views claim status as needed


### **Findings**

No unusable or major issues were found in this review however, there were several minor issues identified, along with open research questions and needed metrics.

| Heuristic Categories | Score | Area of Concern |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Aligns System and Real World | 3~ | S1. Unknown: We don't know how it aligns across channels nor which aspects of that alignment are most needed. 
|  |  | S2. Unclear how the three decision review options occur and why I should choose one above the other. |
| 2. Valuable | 3 | V4. The existence of the online form does seem to provide value to new and returning users however the opt-in to the new system doesn’t not clearly state the benefits for Veterans who are already in the review system. 
|  |  | V5. Unknown: How are we measuring satisfaction around forms? Could the customer satisfaction score be pulled from the Medallia score? |
| 3. Findable | 3.5 | F4. Unknown: What is the Veteran experience like filing an NoD by visiting a VA center? |
| 4. Clear | 2.8 | C1. Listing multiple deadline scenarios in the introduction makes it overly complex to understand before starting the form.
|  |  | C5. Introduction steps and filing deadlines have too much jargon to be considered simple. |
| 5. Trustworthy/Credible | 2.75 | T3. Unknown: We aren't sure how easy it is to contact a helpful person.
|  |  | T4. Could be more informational when it comes to explaining new process and reasons for disagreement and need more information about choices |
| 6. Control and Freedom | 3.5 | CF4. Easy to exit, but harder to return to unless you have the direct URL. The incomplete form does not show up in myVA or as a notification for the account. |
| 7. Learnable | 2.6 | L1. Form steps do not change as you progress. |
| 8. Error Prevention | 3 | E1. Form controls are clear, but language and terms are not, especially around 2019 seem unclear and confusing. |
| 9. Frictionless | 2.4 | F1. Header + Progress bar + copy can be more descriptive
|  |  | F4. For Veterans moving from paper forms to online forms, there's a lack of clarity to what happens in the process, and if the timeline for decisions is extended.
|  |  | Unknown: how do Veterans feel after filing an NoD? What are their expectations? |

Heuristic values include:

- Unusable: imperative to fix Unusable (0)
- Major issue: Important to fix with high priority Critical (1)
- Minor issue: should be given low priority Moderate (2)
- Minor issue: could be improved but does not affect process (3)
- Meets Criteria No Issues (Default Value) (4)

### **Primary Opportunity Areas**

- Learn more about cross-channel experiences and contacting support during form use
- Improve ‘steps’ construct when progressing through this form (and likely others)
- Simplify language to make it easier to understand and choose the right pathway
- Find metrics on satisfaction and completion rates (setting up dashboard for NOD
