# Request a Board Appeal Discovery and Evaluative Research

VA BENEFITS · CE Decision Review

**Apr 2023**

## **Overview**

The Request for Board Appeal form was released in April 2022 and is overdue for a post-launch review of the feature. The scope of this evaluative discovery includes reviewing qualitative and quantitative data, redefining product outcomes, and identifying opportunities for improvement and ways to measure the impact of our work on the form.

### **Phases**

1. Analytics review and SME discovery conversations
2. Veteran facing evaluative research

### VA priorities

- Each Veteran’s appeal is timely docketed and tracked throughout the appeals process
- Each Veteran receives a timely hearing by a Veterans Law Judge upon request
- Each Veteran receives a timely decision on his/her appeals


### **Goals**

1. Understand the Veteran’s experience of the current digital form
    1. What was the experience like for Veterans who have submitted a request for board appeal on va.gov?
    2. What is the experience like for Veterans looking to submit a request for board appeal?
    3. How helpful is the current content on va.gov for Veterans choosing between decision reviews?
2. Understand how digital form submissions are affecting the VBA and BVA process
    1. What is it like getting a data set from VA.gov?
    2. Where can service be improved to expedite claims?
    3. What pain points do claims processors have?
3. Investigate areas where we can increase the user’s confidence before entering the form.
    1. Users don’t fully understand why their claim was denied initially
    2. Users are unsure which decision-review pathway will yield the best results
4. Investigate areas where we can increase the user’s confidence within the form flow.
    1. Users aren’t able to see the evidence submitted with their original claim
    2. There is no way of reviewing or saving a copy of the form once submitted digitally

### **Metrics**

- Improve data capture and transmission for NOD submissions.
   - Claim submission / establishment failure at 0% 
- Increase the number of hearings scheduled using VA.gov
   - Reduction of form abandonment when selecting board hearing type
- Increase the number of veterans choosing the right hearing
  - Reduction in the number of hearing rejections caused by hearing type


### **Tasks**

- Google Analytics and Medalia review
- SME interviews
- Veteran facing interviews and usability tests

## **Assumptions**

- There is no difference between the paper form and the digital experience (barring the updates that need to be made).
    - VHA appeal
    - Request for extension
- There is one form (VA Form 10182) for all different types of contentions.
- The Board Appeal process is not affected by the PACT Act.
- Virtual hearings can be requested without representative information (removed from online form)

## **Evaluative Questions**

### **Quantitative questions**

- What critical points along the Board Appeal online form journey currently have the highest drop-off rate?
- What opportunities have been captured in the Medallia survey?
- What is the baseline satisfaction rating for Board Appeal?
- Does the digital form improve user satisfaction?
- How many Veterans choose to manually send evidence rather than uploading immediately?
- How many Veterans still choose to select to do a board hearing the long backlog and wait *“Please keep in mind that this option has the longest wait time for a decision because there are currently tens of thousands of pending hearing requests.”*?
- What percentage of users are interacting with the form using AT (assistive technology)?
    - If any, what tool are they using?
- What percentage of users are on mobile vs desktop?
    - Which pages within the form are more accessed on mobile vs desktop?
- Is there myVA (VA: Health and benefits) app usage data related to Board Appeal? Can they check the status of appeal there? (this might be an evaluation that comes after veteran facing research)

### **Goals Questions**

- What is the scope for the online NoD form? What compensation types is it looking to cover?
- Is there a difference for Veterans applying for different compensation types (ie. appeal a PCAFC)?
- Does the BVA have processes in place to support other compensation types?
- What scenarios would the BVA want veterans to be applying for a board appeal vs other decision review types?

### **Support / Contact Center Questions**

- Can we find out if there are instances where veterans are trying to use the 'application ID' for reference after submission?
- Where are Veterans calling for support while filling out the digital form?
- How are Veterans referring to the Board Appeal when they’re calling for help (appeal, board of appeal, notice of disagreement)?

### **Notification Questions**

- What is the notify team providing along the journey/doing to Veterans during the process of filing for a Board Appeal?
    - What formats are they delivered in? (mobile, email, **app** notification?)
    - Can we see samples for each?
    - How does that change if a form is incomplete (for weeks, months, years)

### **Process Questions**

- What are the most common issues you see with this type of decision review that cause the backlog to build?
- Does the type of hearing selected have a significant impact on the outcome of the decision?
- Are there use cases when it is better or worse to choose a certain hearing type?
- Are there other SMEs we should hear from prior to the Veteran facing evaluation?
- Does the VSO submit through a separate system?
- When should the Veteran be filing a board appeal as opposed to the two other appeals?
- Are there scenarios where the BVA would when they should be filing something else, if so, how often is that happening?
- Is there a clear identifier between forms submitted through va.gov to forms submitted by mail?
- What happens when a Veteran identifies themselves as homeless on the form?
- Representative name is required to set up a tele hearing request, but it is not currently on the digital form? Why was it taken out of the initial release?

### **Quality Assurance Questions**

- Is there a BVA role responsible for gathering feedback from board attorneys, hearing operations, and judges?
- How is the health of the appeals service assessed?
- How is feedback from board attorneys, hearing operations, and judges collected?
- How is feedback from Veterans collected? Is there a BVA equivalent for customer service or success?
- Do SME's such as Quality Control have documented points of friction?
- Is there a way to see the satisfaction for paper form experience (to compare with the digital form experience)?

### **Content Questions**

- Which stakeholders are directing content team edits on static sitewide pages regarding decision reviews?
- How does the content team receive feedback and updates for static sitewide pages?

### **Technical Questions**

- How does the NoD currently route in the backend? Is it all through central mail? Any opportunity in VBMS?
- Are all claims available online through VBMS or is it only disability claims?

### **Veteran Questions**

- How is the current online experience?
- Are there any areas of friction when filling out the request?
- What information are veterans looking for when self servicing?
- Is the information provided sufficient in helping them progress with the form?
- Are there unmet needs in the current form?
- How confident are they in filling out the form and understanding the process after submission?

## **Broader Questions**

- Of the people who are choosing a direct review, how many have gone through HLR and/or why have they chosen this option?
- Where are areas of friction in the current NoD process?
- Are veterans informed as to why their claim was denied when they receive their decision letter?
- How many use informal conferences? What are some common questions/needs that come up? Is this being under/over/misused?
