## **Background**

Veterans can file a request for a board appeal if they are dissatisfied or disagree with a VA decision on their benefits claim in hopes of receiving a higher benefits rating. The Request for Board Appeal online form was released in April 2022 and hasn’t received a post-launch review of the feature. The focus of this qualitative study is to evaluate the usability and learn what decision led veterans to choose the board appeal pathway over the others.

### **BVA Priorities**

We are working with the Board of Veterans Appeals to discover ways we can help meet the following goals:

- Each Veteran’s appeal is timely docketed and tracked throughout the appeals process
- Each Veteran receives a timely hearing by a Veterans Law Judge upon request
- Each Veteran receives a timely decision on his/her appeal

### **Veteran Journey**

Services and products coming out of this effort would support the following phases of a veteran’s journey: Taking Care of Myself, Retiring, Aging and Putting down roots, specifically engaging VA to access benefits and services in the [Veteran Journey Map](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) .

## **Research Goals**

1. Understand the Veteran’s experience of the current digital form, identify possible usability and accessibility issues within the form.
2. Understand the Veteran’s reason for choosing to apply for a Board Appeal as opposed to the other two decision review pathways.
3. Understand the Veteran’s reason for choosing a hearing type.

## **Methodology**

Moderated interview and usability test of Request a Board Appeal form through production or screen sharing the staging environment.

## **Research Questions**

1. What are the high and low points for Veterans requesting a board appeal?
    1. High points:
        1. Majority of Veterans gave high marks (5/6 out of 6) for form experience. The main reason they quoted was they found the form easy and self-explanatory.
    2. Low points:
        1. The few Veterans that gave lower marks for form experience (4) stated that it was hard to find, and that they wanted to compare it to the paper form to see if they could explain their case.
        3. Misleading language about contested claim
        4. Not being able to meet deadline requirements
        5. Not being able to explain their reason for appealing on the form
2. Are Veterans able to submit a fully developed request for a board appeal online form?
    1. What are the areas of friction and pain points that exist within the current form?
        1. Misleading language about contested claim
        3. Adverse reaction to the language about wait times for hearings
    2. Are there unique pain points to disabled Veterans, including those using screen readers or ZoomText (magnification)?
        1. Undetermined. A separate accessibility test would be required.
3. Is the content provided sufficient in helping them progress through the form?
    1. How confident are Veterans in filling out the form and understanding the process after submission?
        1. Veterans are confident that they can complete the form, but they lack confidence in the success of the form.
        2. Their understanding about the process is that they have to be patient and wait.
4. How helpful or unhelpful is the current content on VA.gov for Veterans choosing between decision reviews?
    1. What information are Veterans looking for when self-servicing?
        1. Veterans looked at requirements, deadlines, and the time it takes.
    2. Do users understand the difference between a denial and disagreement, and how does it affect their confidence in choosing a decision review?
        1. Unclear. Veterans that had either a denial or didn't agree with their assessments would look to file a Board Appeal.
5. Would giving veterans the ability to review and save a copy of their form provide any value for them?
    1. Yes. A few veterans we spoke to had their records lost by the VA, which lowered their confidence in the VA keeping their records. There are also cases where submissions weren’t received and the Veteran had to call to find out. Allowing them to review and save a copy of their form is part of the form instructions, as well as give them a reference for what they’ve submitted.
6. How much confidence do you have that your appeal will be handled properly and in a timely manner?
    1. Veterans have confidence that the VA will handle their claim properly, but low belief that it would be handled in a timely manner, given the timelines that they see on the introduction pages. A few Veterans are under the impression that the PACT Act extended timelines for the different AMA options.

## **Hypotheses and Conclusions**

1. We believe Veterans do not understand what is needed from them to gain favorable judgment.
- **True.** Veterans have lower confidence in the success of their submission because of various reasons, including the following:
    - Veterans don’t understand the parameters that VA considers when rating their disabilities
    - Veterans know evidence is needed for a successful claim, but unsure if they have enough evidence to support their claim. This concern comes from lack of medical records from service, or lost medical records after leave.
    - Veterans are unsure that the piece of evidence required by the VA even exists due to missing records and lost files.
    - Veterans wait for the VA to inform them of what evidence or appointments are needed for them to process the appeal.
    - Veterans believe that it depends on the luck of the draw for who reviews your claims.
2. We believe that Veterans submitting a Request for Board Appeal have considered the other two disagreement pathways before moving forward with the application.
- **Not true.** Among the Veterans we spoke to, Veterans know they can submit evidence to Supplemental Claim, but are unsure about the difference between Higher Level Reviews and Notice of Disagreements. They end up choosing based on timeline, their perceived sequential requirements, or the language on VA.gov.
3. We believe that the content provided about the Request for Board Appeal before, during, and after the application sets reasonable expectations for Veterans about the timeline and process.
- **Partially True.** A Veteran pointed out a copy discrepancy for timelines about the Board Appeals between two sitewide content pages. There is also a language mismatch with the contested claims definition.
4. We believe that Veterans are unclear about the deadlines for submission, and issues they can request a board appeal for.
- **Partially True.** Veterans we spoke to understood that the deadline for Board Appeals is 1 year from the decision date, but one Veteran thought the decision date applies for the original claim and not their appeals.
5. We believe that the updates to the paper form that are missing from the digital form may be preventing Veterans from successfully completing a Board Appeal request.
- **True.** Veterans did not know they could request an extension, and thought that they had to redo the entire application if they missed a deadline due to circumstances beyond their control
6. We believe Veterans desire a copy of the form once it’s submitted digitally
- **True.** Veterans with the experience that the VA has lost their submissions, records, etc, will keep a folder of their own records with the VA.

## **Key Findings**

1. There are multiple entry points to the Request a Board Appeal form, but no clear path to it from MyVA, which lowers Veteran confidence in filing themselves.
2. There is no indicator or clear path back to the in-progress form. The participant had to follow a path to start the form over before seeing their in-progress form.
3. Veterans don’t see the difference between a Higher Level Review and Board Appeal apart from having different reviewers and the time that it takes to go through each process.
4. Veterans choose a review option based on whether they have evidence to submit, and how long each process takes.
5. Language about ‘contested claims’ within the form lacks clarity, and causes unease and hesitation for Veterans looking to request a Board Appeal.
6. For the few Veterans considering a hearing, they expressed interest in doing it virtually, because of distance reasons.
7. The ambiguous language on a text field within the disagreement screen created a misconception about the purpose of the field and participant frustration when attempting to use it.

## **Details of Findings**

### **Finding 1**

There are multiple entry points to the Request a Board Appeal form, but no clear path to it from MyVA,

- 5 Veterans went through the CST. P3, P4, P5, P6, P10
- 3 Veterans went through the search bar. P2, P7, P8
- 2 Veterans went through the homepage. P1, P8
- 2 Veterans attempted through the footer. P1, P2
- 1 Veteran referred to their decision letter to search for the form by form number. P9
- 1 Veteran attempted through eBenefits. P7

> Like you think it would be on the homepage, right? File a client. But it's not there. You gotta kinda fish around and then you can kind of see it at the bottom on these blue links. Normally by this point I just get too frustrated and I try it again later. - P1
> 

> The biggest thing I have for you guys that I've seen when we're going through. This is just being able to find it. The links are not the most user friendly. - P8
> 

> Finding the form on the website. I probably have to give it, maybe a 4 or 5, because it's rather difficult to find without going through the paper form that they mailed to me. - P9
> 

### **Finding 2**

There is no indicator or clear path back to the in-progress form. The participant had to follow a path to start the form over before seeing their in-progress form

We asked 5 Veterans to save and get back to the in-progress form, and all of them were unable to. One eventually figured out that they would see the form if they followed the same path that they started the form with.

> Like this one was a survivor's pension, sometimes they show up at the bottom down here. Or, if you start a new claim, it'll ask you if you want to continue something you prefer previously saved. - P1.
> 

> I realize that I consider myself a pretty, you know, technology savvy guy, and believe it or not, I guess I'm still used to navigating it on my own, having to actually explain it to someone what you're doing, what you're looking at, man, that was kind of rough. - P10
> 

### **Finding 3**

Veterans don’t see the difference between a Higher Level Review and Board Appeal apart from having different reviewers and the time that it takes to go through each process.

> You're asking me about a Supplemental Claim right? Board Appeal is a Higher Level Review right? I guess I haven't done that yet. I WILL be doing that. -P1

> [When asked if PPT submitted a Board Appeal] The Board Appeal, was that not the Higher Level Claim? -P10

> I guess, yeah. So I don't know if I would follow under the Higher Level Review or the Board Appeal. -P7

### **Finding 4**

Veterans chose a review option based on whether they had evidence to submit, and how long each process takes.

![Screenshot 2023-07-10 at 2 09 34 PM](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/111457818/4458467c-3e2d-454e-a411-34582a9a6c75)

Out of the 8 that went through the form, 4 chose to add evidence, 3 chose to do a direct review, and 1 chose a hearing. A few Veterans pointed out the description for the hearing option that stated “tens of thousands of pending hearing requests” as a reason for aversion towards that option.

> So, since I really don't have any more evidence, basically request a direct review would be pretty much my only decision or selection. -P9
> 

> Obviously I have no more evidence. Ooh, keep in mind that is the longest wait because there are currently tens of thousands of pending hearing requests, and that right there deters a lot of stuff. Because it becomes a waiting game, and honestly, it’s a game of attrition, who’s going to wait the longest. -P10
> 

> And then the board takes so long. I had a hearing docket set up, and then the lawyer’s like, well, you’re talking like 6 to 8 years realistically, you know. Just the backlog. And that’s why we switched over the lane with the appeal docket just to add new information to my claim and get it done. -P8

### **Finding 5**

Language about ‘contested claims’ within the form lacks clarity, and causes unease and hesitation for Veterans looking to request a Board Appeal.

![Screenshot 2023-07-10 at 2 03 59 PM](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/111457818/d4aadbdd-da51-4476-a6fd-74b08c09a067)

The definition for contested claims within the deadline page caused Veterans to think it was related to their disability claim, when in reality, a contested claim only occurs if two people try to submit the same claim (which does not happen with disability).

> If I get a favorable claim what other person would be in denial or reduced benefits? -P2

> Contested claims, when a favorable claim decision for one person is resolved in denial. Usually you don't compare 2 people's claims. I don't know if I agree I don't like the way that sentence is worded. -P7

### **Finding 6**

For the few Veterans considering a hearing, they expressed interest in doing it virtually, because of distance reasons.

Only one chose to have a hearing when going through the form, but for Veterans who read the introduction and saw hearing as an option, they mentioned that the Virtual hearings would be ideal because of distance.

> Here I chose the virtual tele hearing online because the regional office is too far from me and the board in Washington is definitely too far. - P2
> 

> I really love this feature of virtual hearing from your home. I want to try that, instead of going to D.C. or conferencing at a VA location. That’s the full advantage here. -P3
> 

### **Finding 7**

The ambiguous language on the ‘something else’ text field within the disagreement screen created a misconception about the purpose of the field and participant frustration when attempting to use it.

![Screenshot 2023-07-10 at 2 10 28 PM](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/111457818/8e0fedf6-9c0b-424d-89d7-88a8c4da501a)

50% of the 8 participants that reached the disagreement screen tried to add context for why they’re disagreeing with what they’re disagreeing with.

> And I would give the details of like, you know why I think that my condition was degraded, or the rating was not proper. I would give my statements here. [tries typing in field] Oh, there is a limit of words here. I guess I'm not able to type more than this. -P3
> 

> If I had something I wanted to add, I would put it here. -P6
> 

## **Additional Findings**

1. The load time for myVA and the Claim Status Tool takes longer than expected, and causes an extra level of frustration.
    
    > Normally by this point I just get too frustrated and I try it again later. -P1
    > 
    
    > There's kind of that loading sequence, and sometimes a loading sequence doesn't even load, and tells you that it's down right now, and that can be very disheartening, especially if you're not sure if the claim has been fully submitted. -P3
    > 
    
    > When it loads here lol...oh yeah, the slow - P5
    > 
2. Veterans use sources outside of VA.gov to guide their decision review consideration and application process.
    
    > As far as how to improve or do better on the I'll watch YouTube videos. I'm constantly watching or listening to YouTube videos. Helen Potton is a lawyer site. They're really good about explaining things to vets and how we can file things for them. -P1
    > 
    
    > Google, but we, I mean, I start off the VA website. But not even that. I'm not always. I don't always trust it. -P5
    > 
    
    > Yeah, I've been logged into a couple Facebook groups that discussed, you know, via ratings and what evidence you gotta provide. -P7
    > 
    
    > Va gov, get in touch with the VSOs, and you know, just kind of calling around. You get more information from networks of people. -P10
    > 
3. The AMA deadline requirements are causing Veterans to restart their claims, due to circumstances outside of their control.
    
    > And those 2 appointments got rescheduled 6 months. Then it was a year, and it was like 15 months, and at the 12 month point the VA sent me a notice. Hey, there hasn't been any change to your packet in 12 months, so you have to reapply. -P7
    > 
    
    > A year to make an appeal on the housing, and I didn't get the decision till after the appeal date had ended. -P5
    > 
4. Veterans believe that they need to go through the process multiple times, in order to fully complete their appeals. They also believe the process is sequential due to hearsay and experiencing remands, which move their claims from a Board Appeal to a Supplemental Claim.
    
    > They give you the option, but as I've been told and what I've read. If you jump the gun and go to the Board Appeal, you're less likely to have it processed. They kick it back down anyway, so you should start with the Supplemental Claim and then go step by step. -P5
    > 
    
    > But typically I mean, everyone's told me that your VA claim is never done on the first for the second review, usually gotta do it a few times. They said, if you don't get it taken care of while you're still on active duty, that afterwards it's just more difficult. -P7
    > 
    
    > If you need to get it raised, something else it would be on the first thing it'd be if you wanna fight to get that connected. Once it's connected, then you can go through the go back through the other routes and get it, you know, like a Higher Level Review, or go back and do a Supplemental. -P8
    > 
5. There is a lack of medical records from time of service, which lowers a Veteran’s ability to prove service connection.
    
    > Based on the fact that denied my claim. And the issues that I'm claiming are things that I know happened in the military, and some of them don't have paper trails. -P2
    > 
    
    > I’m just assuming that I’m going to get a denial. My records, I’ve been trying to get them since 2012… Oh, I've tried several different things, and I'll get a letter saying that somebody else has your records and haven't returned them, but they don't tell me who's got my records. -P6
    > 
    
    > I don't think a lot of the reviewers take into account also a lot of soldiers, just because they're trying to maintain their career. Will not seek out a lot of help because it does look bad on your record… Soldiers tend to go off offline or off post to receive those benefits just because they don't want it to get on their record, and they don't want their command team to be able to see it because it hurts you just being honest, it hurts you there. -P7
    > 

## **Recommendations**

- Create an indicator for the in-progress forms on myVA. Also, address the opportunity to notify Veterans that they have an in-progress form at a certain drop-off point.
- Reconsider the objective of the deadline screen, and clarify the definition of contested claims.
- Add in a deadline extension option to the digital form (already available on the paper form), and remove the limitation of showing contentions with a decision date within the year.
- Provide a space on the form for Veterans to explain the reason for their disagreement (available as an optional attachment on the paper form).
- Work with IA to provide more accessible points to the Decision Review pathways, with the consideration that there are Veterans who want to learn more about the forms vs Veterans who know exactly which pathway they want to pursue.

### **Next steps**

- Identify and prioritize opportunities for improvement with the digital application, as well as, the holistic decision review process.
- Make design adjustments to the application.
- Collaborate with IA to solve the wayfinding challenges for decision review, and with content on opportunities to improve language and comprehension.

## Further research needed

- Further research may be needed for Veterans who are appealing issues outside of disability
- Further research may be needed for a separate accessibility study with this form
- Further research may be needed for with Veterans who are homeless
