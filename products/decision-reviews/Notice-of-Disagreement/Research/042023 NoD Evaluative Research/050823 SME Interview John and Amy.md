### Open Questions
* What do we want the veteran to know before they start a Board Appeal?
	* Amy:  Vision is.. For the vet to know how to appeal a decision. Would like to see them have more hand-holding (instead of being told “this is what the process is). Wants us to lead the vet through the process and show them which choices they have. 
	* Are there any legal limitations that keep us from making recommendations?
		* I know we have to give them an option to file on paper. I’m not telling them what to do. It’s more like…”here are you 3 choices, here’s what they are…essentially want to give them more info on what they’re choosing and what it “means” to choose said path. 
	* (which dockets to follow, have them be informed of the process and lead through the process.). 
	* Are there certain outcomes that you’ve noticed based on the context vets have for choosing board appeal? That makes you feel like they’re not given enough context upfront?
		* Not sure if we have some way of measuring that. (John & Amy)
	* Do you know if BVA has the ability to distinguish if NOD is coming via va.gov or paper?
		* (John) Yes, we have a field in caseflow that identifies that. (Amy) that has to be manually checked by central intake. So there’s still potential for error. 
		* We may be able to get some qualitative data from the people on the front line to get that information.
* Are there scenarios where the BVA recommends that the Veteran file other decision review types instead of the board appeal ? If so, how often is that happening?
	* John Gos: For AMA 3 options: appeal, HLR, supp claim. BVA or Jane Chi can give you a high level metric of supp claims they review.
	* NOD is about 10% of the volume of all appeals filed.
* What compensation types does the BVA have processes in place to support?
	* If it can be submitted as a claim then appeals come to us for anything. John, we process VHA appeal, CSP and Camm.. Education, loan guarantee (we process..any appeals)
* Is there a difference between the way a digital form submission from va.gov is processed vs a paper form submission?
	* Yes, field
	* Still has to manually be entered by someone in intake
* What type of claims can we service on va.gov through the digital form? (ie. disability vs other claims)?
	* Is there anything we should explicitly not accept via va.gov?
		* Not that we’re aware of
* Where does the PACT Act fall in priority for the Board Appeals?
	* No. Doesn’t affect docket. It still goes in docket order. 
	* AOD (Advance on docket) front line. Few things that qualify for advance in docket
		* Homelessness is front line
		* Over 75
		* Few other cases
	* If you’re not over 75 and you fill a Pact act.. You will still follow the timeline (in other words, we’ll talk to you in a couple of years)
* Are there other SMEs we should hear from prior to the Veteran facing evaluation? Do we have a contact for a Quality Assurance SME?
	* Action Item: QA/QI team focuses on the decision process and the VEO. Send to John after meeting
### Additional Research Questions
*Thanks for your input on our research plan, Amy. Can you expand a little on a few of the questions you suggested adding to the veteran facing research?*
1. How easy/hard is it to understand where you are in the appeals process?
	* What do you mean? (Amy) The context is,  I’m working with John’s team on trying to establish outcomes (OKRs ) the 3 primary outcome the board is looking for: 1) timeliness in intake, timeliness decision making
		* Intake isn’t only someone submitting the request but track where they are in the process.  “Once it gets submitted it goes through docketing. Depending if you want a hearing or not, you’ll be put in hearing or you’ll be put in a docket that doesn’t need a hearing. Then you go to make a decision. . 
		* In a nutshell, what are these distinct points in the process, how long should I expect that to take, and where am I in line? We need to offer veterans more transparency (from intake to decisions). 
2. How much confidence do you have that your appeal will be handled properly and in a timely manner?
3. What kinds of self-service options would you like us to add?
	* Option sin VANotify to opt out of getting written documentation ad that sort of thing, 
	* My personal preference is to make sure there is sufficient notification (e.g. if we are going to tell them” this is what the process looks like and these are the common steps… we should tell them, what the process each is, what the queues are (expected time to wait in the queue). Maybe the vet will want notification everytime they change their steps or when they move up in the queue. 
	* Maybe a self service option is to have control of the notifications (when (like which steps of the process) and how often).
	* (Matt) What amount of technical availability would we have from the notify team (feature request?
	  * (Amy) I am pushing much stronger integration between your team and there. Ask for an invite to be a part of the veteran-facing functionality team.  
4. Does the current process seem too impersonal?  What could we change to make a difference in that respect?

### Additional Thoughts, Feedback or Comments
Amy is pushing for stronger integration between our teams and theirs. Asked to be part of the veteran facing functionality team

Any examples where you’ve seen the experience you want?
* Turbotax
* FAFSA

Amy likes the “step through process”, aka “skip logic”.  
* Veterans don’t know which questions they can skip. By using skip logic, we let users know which questions you can skip. 
  * (if you’re over 21 yrs of age, you’re considered an adult so you don’t have to answer parental questions.) 
  * If they put a date of birth, and they are over 21 years of age, we don’t need to ask them that question.
  * I think there are a number of ways we can make it easier on the Veteran by pulling info in or skipping info we ask in the form.

*Things that are done by hand* 
* (Amy) once form comes in via central mail portal. Staff still have to enter info about the hearing request. The staff copy the info and paste it elsewhere into intake. The digital form doesn’t just pass the information through. “When is that really digital…it is NOT”

Intake operations team members we should speak to: Kendra Jones, Valerie Tolson, William Rollins (insight on how to improve from board and veteran side)
