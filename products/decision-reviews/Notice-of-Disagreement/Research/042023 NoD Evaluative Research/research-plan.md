# Research Plan for Board Appeals

This work is the first of three products to undergo evaluation as part of the decision review pathway for veterans looking to increase their disability rating. For a summary of the three products and information gathered, visit the  [Decision Review Mural Board](https://app.mural.co/t/coforma8350/m/coforma8350/1679600983883/c565af371b4772fe601b1ab9df7a4a8212b7f7e9?sender=udbf574074425980f04c55360)  (sign-in required).
## Background

Veterans can file a request for a board appeal if they are dissatisfied or disagree with a VA decision on their benefits claim in hopes of receiving a higher benefits rating. The Request for Board Appeal online form was released in April 2022 and hasn’t received a post-launch review of the feature. The focus of this qualitative study is to evaluate the usability and learn what decision led veterans to choose the board appeal pathway over the others.
### BVA Priorities
We are working with the Board of Veterans Appeals to discover ways we can help meet the following goals:
* Each Veteran’s appeal is timely docketed and tracked throughout the appeals process
* Each Veteran receives a timely hearing by a Veterans Law Judge upon request
* Each Veteran receives a timely decision on his/her appeal
### Veteran Journey
Services and products coming out of this effort would support the following phases of a veteran’s journey:  Taking Care of Myself, Retiring, Aging  and Putting down roots, specifically engaging VA to access benefits and services in the  [Veteran Journey Map](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) .
## Research Goals

1. Understand the Veteran’s experience of the current digital form, identify possible usability and accessibility issues within the form.
2. Understand the Veteran’s reason for choosing to apply for a Board Appeal as opposed to the other two decision review pathways.
3. Understand the Veteran’s reason for choosing a hearing type.
## Outcomes

We will use the research findings to establish a baseline for measuring the effectiveness of the Request a Board Appeal digital form experience, including:

* Identifying ways to increase usability, accessibility, and veterans’ confidence
* Understanding why veterans select specific hearing types
* Identifying opportunities to improve the content for Decision Reviews
## Research questions
1. What are the high and low points for Veterans requesting a board appeal?
2. Are Veterans able to submit a fully developed request for a board appeal online form? 
	* What are the areas of friction and pain points that exist within the current form?
	* Are there unique pain points to disabled Veterans, including those using screen readers or ZoomText (magnification)?
3. Is the content provided sufficient in helping them progress through the form?
	* How confident are Veterans in filling out the form and understanding the process after submission?
4. How helpful or unhelpful is the current content on VA.gov for Veterans choosing between decision reviews?
	* What information are Veterans looking for when self-servicing?
	* Do users understand the difference between a denial and disagreement, and how does it affect their confidence in choosing a decision review? 
5. Would giving veterans the ability to review and save a copy of their form provide any value for them?
6. How easy/hard is it to understand where you are in the appeals process?
7. How much confidence do you have that your appeal will be handled properly and in a timely manner?
8. What kinds of self-service options would you like us to add?
9. Does the current process seem too impersonal?  What could we change to make a difference in that respect?
## Hypotheses
1. We believe Veterans do not understand what is needed from them to gain favorable judgment.
2. We believe that Veterans submitting a Request for Board Appeal have considered the other two disagreement pathways before moving forward with the application.
3. We believe that the content provided about the Request for Board Appeal before, during, and after the application sets reasonable expectations for Veterans about the timeline and process.
4. We believe that Veterans are unclear about the deadlines for submission, and issues they can request a board appeal for.
5. We believe that the updates to the paper form that are missing from the digital form may be preventing Veterans from successfully completing a Board Appeal request.
6. We believe Veterans desire a copy of the form once it’s submitted digitally.
### Assumptions
* Veterans are getting information from misleading sources outside of VA.gov when making a decision to file a Board Appeal.
* Veterans are uncertain of which disagreement pathway is best for them, but have knowledge of all three before submitting a Board Appeal.
* Veterans are able to submit a Board Appeal online successfully, but will not be confident that his/her submission will result in a favorable outcome. 
* The language about deadlines is unclear to Veterans and decreases confidence.
* There are updates missing from the digital form that would require Veterans to file via paper form.
* Veterans are more confident about their submission when they  have a completed copy of the online form upon submission.
## Methodology

Moderated interview and usability test of Request a Board Appeal form through production or screen sharing the staging environment.
## Location
We’ll conduct remote usability testing over Zoom. This method will enable us to observe participants attempting to file a claim with clear objectives given to them.
## Research materials
*  [Conversation Guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/decision-reviews/Notice-of-Disagreement/Research/042023%20NoD%20Evaluative%20Research/conversation-guide.md) 
## Recruitment

### Recruitment approach
We will recruit participants using a variant of the maximum variation sampling strategy. Our goal is to emphasize  underrepresented veterans in past research. We desire to surface new insights that may not be obvious as a result of studying our usual groups. We will use Perigean’s recruiting service to schedule 18 interviews to achieve 12 completed sessions.
### Recruitment criteria
