## Starting the session

* Keep observers in the waiting room to ask the participant if they still consent to having observers in the session. Tell them to have their camera on with full name displayed for a brief introduction to the participant when they are admitted to the session. 
* In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.
* In the Participant “more” menu, make sure “Play Join and Leave Sound” is unchecked.
* Check your screen sharing setup and share permissions for participants.
* When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro.
## Intro: 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today. I’m Eileen, and I’m part of a team working on the process of appealing benefit decisions on VA.gov.
Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
I have some colleagues in the waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I wanted to confirm before we get going. Are you okay with letting them in for this session?
* If the participant does not consent, ask the observers to kindly leave the Zoom via Slack.
* If a participant consents, let other observers into the room and allow a short pause to say hello. Here are some other members from our website team - if you’d all like to say a quick hello. And now for those of you who just joined, if you could please turn off your cameras to save bandwidth, that would be great.

This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you any longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic to keep us on schedule.

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability; we are testing our work so you cannot do anything wrong here. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. As you go through the exercise, it’ll be really helpful if you can think out loud as much as possible.

As you’ve been briefed by Perigean, for this session, we want to see how you navigate decision review options on VA.gov. You’ve either filed a Board Appeal before, or are looking to file a Board Appeal, and we want to step through the form with you. We will not be submitting the form, or making changes to your account in any way.

If you are uncomfortable with navigating your account, we have a staging environment set up that you can walk through with a fictional scenario. If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know, you'll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete.

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are deleted after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
* If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
Start recording.
I have started recording. I’d like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
## Warm up: 5 minutes

## Emergency Exit
Out of questions: We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback. Despite ending early, you will be compensated for this session.

Blame technology: I am so sorry, but the website is unexpectedly not working properly. I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your time. Despite ending early, you will be compensated for this session.

Backup Moderator: This is best to practice beforehand, but can work if there is an emergency with the moderator. Appoint another team member who will be on the call as the backup moderator. You can say “for the next part of this session Gary/Ruben will moderate.” They should be prepared to jump in if something happens to you or you are not comfortable to finish the session.
