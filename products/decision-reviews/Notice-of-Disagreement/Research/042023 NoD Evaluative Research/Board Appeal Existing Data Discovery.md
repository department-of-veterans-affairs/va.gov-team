# Board Appeal Discovery | Data Review

Benefits Decision Review Team | May 2023

## **Background**

The Request for Board Appeal form was released in April 2022 and is overdue for a post-launch review of the feature. The scope of this evaluative discovery includes reviewing qualitative and quantitative data, redefining product outcomes, and identifying opportunities for improvement and ways to measure the impact of our work on the form.

## **Questions**

- What points along the Board Appeal journey currently have the highest drop-off rate?
- What opportunities have been captured in the Medallia survey?
- What is the baseline satisfaction rating for Board Appeal?
- Does the digital form improve user satisfaction?

## **Data Points**

Date range for data reviewed is between April 2022 and April 2023

- Request and review DOMO dashboard
- Review Google Analytics
- Review Medallia survey entries
- Review MyVA411 calls

### **Summary of Findings**

1. There is a high exit rate for the introduction
2. There is a high exit rate for the contestable issues step, what are the reasons for this?
    1. Veterans noted that they did not see their contestable issues listed
    2. Veterans noted that they could not add additional information about their issue
    3. Veterans noted that PCAFC issues are not supported
3. Veterans are being led to the Board Appeal form through PACT campaigns. Did the PACT Act have an affect on Board Appeal form processing?

### **Google Analytics Findings**

Report dates: Mar 1, 2022-Mar 1, 2023

Generally, veterans seem to progress through the form if they were moving from one form page to the next (I.e. When the previous page visited was a form page). Pages with higher than site average bounce rates and exit rates tend to have lower page views. This indicates that those pages have unique attributes like campaign ID in the URL, different sources (e.g. the way veterans are arriving at the page), etc. Based on the data, we’ve concluded that the pages with higher bounce rates were mostly entrance pages (i.e. pages that users directly landed on). Contrastingly, exit rates were impacted by campaign ids in the url and  number of issues a veteran is inputting.

Entrance pages with bounce rates are as follows:
- Introduction page 
- Add issues
- Contestable issues
- Contact information
- Evidence upload

Page(s) with notable exit rates:
- Area of Disagreement: exit rates over 40% when there are 10 or more issues.
- Introduction pages - exit rates over 40%. Note, this page shows up repeated in the report because the url has variation because of the marketing campaign used at the time. 
- Add issues - exit rates over 15%


### **Medallia Findings**

- 12 Veterans provided a satisfaction rating on the confirmation page, with a median of 2 and an average of 2.8. It is unclear whether the Veteran was rating satisfaction of the form or the entire decision review journey.

- 2 Veterans stated PCAFC Claims were not supported
- 10 issues recorded within the add issues step
    - Veterans are not finding their issues listed

- 4 Agent Orange/PACT Claim submissions were found among feedback

    - About income drops
    - Additional information about disagreement (service connection)
- Document upload functionality not working
