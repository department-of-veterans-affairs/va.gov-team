# Research Plan for Decision Review Team, Accessible Copy of Completed Submission, Feb 2024
## Background
In previous studies, we found that Veterans have a desire to save a copy of their submitted forms. As the submission PDF currently exists, it is not accessible to Veterans with visual impairments that are using screen readers. We are proposing providing an HTML page that allows Veterans who are using screen readers to review their submission, as well as an optional download.

In this exploratory study, we seek to understand how Veterans who use screen readers would review and save a copy of their completed form. We hope the results from the study will help inform accessibility best practices for our team going forward.

We believe it is important to support Veterans using screen readers to access a record of their online submissions.

Participants will walk through a code prototype on staging.

### OCTO Priorities
This research supports 2 of the 2024 OCTO Objectives:
Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.
Our platforms are the best way to deliver products at VA.

This research supports OCTO 2023 priorities 2 and 6:
- Solidify the VA.gov platform
- Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience

It also supports OCTO goals 5 and 6:
- Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features
   
### Veteran Journey
Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)? Are there moments that matter?

Key moments this research touches in the Veteran journey are:
- Engaging VA to access benefits and services
- Finding additional sources of income
- Taking care of my health
  
This research also touches on aging and managing new needs for those that develop vision issues or blindness later in life.

## Research Goals
What are you trying to learn from this research?
1.  Evaluate the effectiveness and value of the accessible submitted appeal page for Veterans using screen readers.
2.  Understand how Veterans using screen readers are currently accessing and storing a copy of their appeal submission.
3.  Understand where Veterans using screen readers expect to access, and how they expect to use  a copy of their submission.

### Outcome
- We believe the results from the study will help inform accessibility best practices for our team going forward.

### Research questions
#### GOAL 1: Evaluate the effectiveness and value of the accessible submitted appeal copy page for Veterans using screen readers.
- Do Veterans using screen readers know that they can review a copy of their submission through the confirmation page?
- Do Veterans using screen readers seek to review a copy of their submission?

#### GOAL 2: Understand how Veterans using screen readers are getting copies of their submitted form.
- How do Veterans using screen readers access a copy of their submission?
- How do Veterans using screen readers save a copy of their submission?

#### GOAL 3.  Understand where Veterans using screen readers expect to access, and how they expect to use  a copy of their submission.
- Where do Veterans using screen readers expect to access a record of their submitted form?
- What do Veterans using screen readers want to do with a copy of their submission?

### Hypothesis
1. We hypothesize that the copy of the submission page will be usable by Veterans using screen readers. They will be able to understand it and save it.
2. We hypothesize that there is a need for Veterans, including those using screen readers, to save a copy of their submission.
3. We hypothesize that Veterans using screen readers would want to return to copy of submission page at a later time.
4. We hypothesize that two of the four methods of storing results (PDF and printing) will be less valuable if a Veteran is blind and/or rely on a screen reader.

## Methodology

**Follow Up Call:**
Please follow up by phone with prospective participants with these (4) questions and please let us know what they say. 
1. We want to confirm that you use a screen reader due to low vision or blindness
2. What is the name of the screen reader technology you are using?
3. What is your comfort level with using screenreaders, very comfortable, comfortable, or still learning?
4. Are you comfortable joining a Zoom call using your screen reader technology?
5. We’ll have an accessibility specialist on the call. Are there any other accommodations that would be helpful during this session?
6. (If participant uses Dolphin) Are you able to join the study on two devices, one for Zoom, and one to navigate to the webpages for this session?

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves) What criteria would strengthen your results?**
Note: The following demographic criteria is our goal, but we understand that historically it's been challenging to recruit participants who use screenreaders.

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.

### Prepare

Before recruitment starts, we would like to **request a kickoff call with Perigean** to align on recruitment criteria and terminology for screnner questions in the survey and emails that will be sent to Veterans. We would also like to discuss the relative priorities of recruitment criteria and how the criteria are prioritized when recruiting replacements for participants who cancel in advance.

The team is available for a kickoff call during any of these times:
- 1/22 3:30PM ET, 4:00PM ET, 4:30PM ET
- 1/23 1:30PM ET, 4:30PM ET
- 1/24 3:00PM ET, 3:30PM ET, 4:30PM ET

Please invite Eileen (eileen.chi@coforma.io), Sade (sade@coforma.io), and Lauren (lauren.sinreich@coforma.io) to the kickoff call.

**Prior to the kickoff call, we would like a link or screenshot of the recruitment survey** for this study so we can review it beforehand.

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session.
-   Pilot participant email: TBD
-   Date and time of pilot session: TBD

### Research sessions
Planned dates of research: 

2/6-2/12

### Length of sessions
Session length: (e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours):
-   60 minutes
    
Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time) 
-   60 minutes buffer

Maximum Sessions per day: (We all have limits - how many sessions can you and your team conduct in one day considering the session length, the mental strain of conducting sessions, other work you still need to complete in a day, etc?)
-   2 per day

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time. Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.

Please request enough dates and at least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; 12 time slots for 6 participants). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.

2/6 9AM-6PM ET
2/7 9AM-6PM ET
2/8 9AM-6PM ET
2/9 9AM-6PM ET
2/12 9AM-6PM ET
2/13 9AM-6PM ET
