# Conversation Guide for Benefits Decision Reviews - Accessible record of an appeal submission, Feb 2024
## Starting the session
* Keep observers in the waiting room to ask the participant if they still consent to having observers in the session. Tell them to have their camera on with full name displayed for a brief introduction to the participant when they are admitted to the session. 
* In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.
* In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked.
* Check your screen sharing setup and share permissions for participants.
* When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro.
## Intro: 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today. I’m Eileen, and I’m part of a team working on decision review forms on the VA.gov website.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
I have 4 colleagues in the Zoom waiting room–we often include a couple of people to observe and take notes. Are you okay with having them join us for this session?
* If the participant does not consent, ask the observers to kindly leave the Zoom via Slack.
* If a participant consents, let other observers into the room and allow a short pause to say hello. Here are some other members from our website team - if you'd all like to say a quick hello, and then mute, that would be great.

This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you any longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic to keep us on schedule.

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability; we are testing our work so you cannot do anything wrong here. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. As you go through the exercise, it'll be really helpful if you can think out loud as much as possible.

As you’ve been briefed by Perigean, the company that recruited for this session, we want to understand what you would do right after you submit a claim or decision review (aka appeal) form.

Before we get started, I want to ask for your permission to record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are deleted after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
* If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
* We like to use transcription to improve our notes. However, this Zoom setting turns on Closed Captions in Zoom, which can be a problem for screen readers. Would it be disruptive do have Closed Captions on?
  * If no, turn on transcription.

Start recording. Turn on transcription.

I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Do I have your permission to record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
## Warm up
_Goal: Confirm they qualify for the study, and understand how they currently keep or access a record of their submission._

Before we look at the website, I'd like to get a little background information from you:
* Can you tell me a little bit about the last time you filed a claim or appeal?
* How do you currently file and manage your VA claims and appeals?
* How do you currently keep a record of your VA claims and appeals?

## Participant Tech Setup
Next, I want to get our tech set up.

## Task 1: Review the confirmation page 
Scenario: Today we’ll be reviewing a few pages regarding the Board Appeal form VA-10182. A Board Appeal is one of the decision review pathways you can go through if you don’t agree with a decision on your claim. We’ll be going through a mock scenario where you just filled out and submitted a Board Appeal form, and have reached the confirmation page. We want to understand your expectations for this experience.

As you move through the steps, please do your best to think out loud and let us know what is particularly clear or particularly unclear or challenging about the way the form is structured. I will mostly be observing, and I may ask you to pause at certain points and ask you questions.
Spend some time reviewing this page. Let us know when you’re ready to continue.

* After reviewing this page, what are you most likely to do next?
* After you click the links, what do you expect will happen?
