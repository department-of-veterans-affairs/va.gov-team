## Background
Today, when Veterans file an appeal on va.gov, there is no way for them to maintain a record of their submission. To increase Veteran trust of the reliability of our products, we want to provide the ability to retain a copy of a submitted appeal, so Veterans can store it in their personal records. This study is focused on the accessibility of receiving a copy of submission, because we found that PDFs we currently generate may not be accessible to Veterans using screen readers. We want to use this study to check our assumptions, and provide alternate methods for Veterans to save a copy.

### OCTO Objectives
This research supports 2 of the 2024 OCTO Objectives: 
* Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits. 
* Our platforms are the best way to deliver products at VA.

This research supports OCTO 2023 priorities 2 and 6:
* Solidify the VA.gov platform
* Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience

It also supports OCTO goals 5 and 6:
* Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
* Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

### Veteran Journey
Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)? Are there moments that matter?
Key moments this research touches in the Veteran journey are:
* Engaging VA to access benefits and services
* Finding additional sources of income
* Taking care of my health
This research also touches on aging and managing new needs for those that develop vision issues or blindness later in life.

## Research Goals
1. Evaluate the effectiveness and value of the accessible submitted appeal page for Veterans using screen readers.
2. Understand how Veterans using screen readers are currently accessing and storing a copy of their appeal submission.
3. Understand where Veterans using screen readers expect to access, and how they expect to use a copy of their submission.

**Note:** As we found during our studies, Veterans using screen readers include both blind and low-vision Veterans who use screen readers under certain contexts or to supplement their experience with screen readers.

## Research Questions
**GOAL 1: Evaluate the effectiveness and value of the accessible submitted appeal copy page for Veterans using screen readers.**
* Do Veterans using screen readers know that they can review a copy of their submission through the confirmation page?
* Do Veterans using screen readers seek to review a copy of their submission?

**GOAL 2: Understand how Veterans using screen readers are getting copies of their submitted form.**
* How do Veterans using screen readers access a copy of their submission?
* How do Veterans using screen readers save a copy of their submission?

**GOAL 3. Understand where Veterans using screen readers expect to access, and how they expect to use a copy of their submission.**
* Where do Veterans using screen readers expect to access a record of their submitted form?
* What do Veterans using screen readers want to do with a copy of their submission?

## Methodology
* Usability testing with assistive technology users through [prototype](https://staging.va.gov/decision-reviews/submitted-appeal/) shared on the staging environment. We tested the first version with 9 participants, and the second version with 6 participants.

## Hypotheses and Conclusions
* We hypothesize that the copy of the submission page will be usable by Veterans using screen readers. They will be able to understand it and save it. **Mostly True**
  * Veterans using assistive technology found the page to be very accessible (rated as a 4 or 5 out of 5). Screenreader users rated the page as a 5.
* We hypothesize that there is a need for Veterans, including those using screen readers, to save a copy of their submission. **Mostly True**
  * Most Veterans saw a need for the option to either download or print the submission fr their records. Some would even take both actions just to have backups. 
  * A few Veterans mentioned a lack of trust in VA’s ability to to receive submissions or records as a reasoning for why they’d want to keep their own.
  * One Veteran mentioned that it wasn’t necessary to save a copy because they knew what information they’ve submitted, and they didn’t want to manage more files as a blind Veteran. They did mention having the expectation that it would be accessible online via the Claim Status Tool.
* We hypothesize that Veterans using screen readers would want to return to copy of submission page at a later time. **Mostly False**
  * Although most Veterans prefer a method to receive a copy of their submission, they didn’t express interest in coming back to the site to see this information. A few reasons include, not having the expectations for VA to keep sensitive information for long periods, difficulty navigating through VA.gov website to find this information, and feeling more secure in a paper trail they can manage.
* We hypothesize that two of the four methods of storing results (PDF and printing) will be less valuable if a Veteran is blind and/or rely on a screen reader. **Maybe True**
  * 5 out of 7 Veterans using a screen reader expressed interest in downloading the PDF to save as a digital copy for their records. 
  * Although Veterans using a screen reader aren’t happy with the accessibility of PDFs, they expect it from VA, and use OCR or similar technology to help read inaccessible PDFs.
  * 3 out of 7 Veterans using a screen reader expressed interest in printing a copy to store in their physical cabinet and/or to share with people who help them manage their claims and records.
 
## Key Findings
1. Veterans found a separate page for a copy of their submission was redundant to the confirmation page, and the link language misled Veterans into believing the form was not yet submitted.
2. Veterans prefer saving a digital or physical copy of their submission. If they saved a copy of their submission, they would not be as inclined to return to a page on VA.gov for that information.
3. Veterans found the 'What to Expect Next' section valuable, and would want to highlight the timeline for immediate expectations and the rest of the process.
4. Veterans using screen readers expect multiple methods of contact, and prefer being notified by email.
5. Veterans use headings and search to navigate a page, and there is a mixed reaction to the use of lower level headings.
6. Veterans using screen readers expect to receive PDFs from VA and rely on alternate methods to read them when they’re inaccessible.

### Finding 1
Veterans found a separate page for a copy of their submission was redundant to the confirmation page, and the link language misled Veterans into believing the form was not yet submitted.

![Screenshot 2024-03-27 at 1 16 23 PM](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/111457818/998f2386-9bdd-40c8-abfe-4bbc41d8475f)

On the initial 2 screen prototype, 6 out of 7 Veterans missed the link to the second screen. When prompted, Veterans mentioned that the link language made them believe that the form has yet been submitted. When guided to the second screen, Veterans mentioned that the information is useful, but had the expectation that the information on the two pages to be combined.

> This page sounds good like I was thinking as we could easily take the previous page and merge some of the elements from that page onto this page and get rid of that previous page altogether. Just because that previous page really serves little purpose concerning that you're doing that confirmation 2 pages back, or just somehow. Yeah, this is the more important of the 2 pages we've reviewed. - **P7**

> I would say it's a probably about a 4 out of 5 for usefulness, and say that only because it seems redundant to the previous page. Okay, there's a bit of redundancy here. It's kind of going through same thing over and over, the other one just said, if you want to view it and then print it or view it, and save it, or whatever that button was on the other page, support you here, which said the same thing. But this one obviously says, more information on your phone numbers and addresses. I think 2 of them could be combining into just one page. - **P8**

>  Review and save it. It sounds like it hasn't been saved. And if it hasn't been saved, it hasn't been submitted. So i'll review. I can review my request that would make sense. I don't know about the and save because at this point about that's what I was checking with you, I’ve already submitted it. - **P1**

### Finding 2
Veterans prefer saving a digital or physical copy of their submission. If they saved a copy of their submission, they would not be as inclined to return to a page on VA.gov for that information.

Veterans expressed interest in saving a copy of their submission for their records, even if they hope to not have to revisit the information again. Instead, they would reference it for the Next Steps information, and ways to contact VA. They aren’t as interested in coming back to the site for this information, citing that they weren’t sure if this information could be kept long-term and it was more difficult to navigate on the site vs within their documents.

> So from an electronic copy, when I go to file and stuff like that. It's on the computer. I get mailed stuff, all that type of stuff. Here's forms that I have to fill out on hand and sign initialize and send in. I have those copies, hard copies. and then I have screenshots on my phone from when I use the app. So paper trails all over the place. And again, that's from a militaryism that's when I was in the military and then, more importantly, when I started filing this in 2016. I don't know how many times in that first year I got the “we didn't get the form. It was this form, you filled out that form.” And so in the beginning, when I was doing paper copies, I was actually taking pictures with my phone to say, “here's the form that I submitted.” So when they turn around and say that I didn't submit it, I could be like, “here, here's me in the VA center, here's the VA people, here's the form.” - **P13**

> If I had downloaded a copy. Even if I was waiting for the physical version to be mailed, I don't think I would [return to this page]. Just don't want to see a reason to, you know all of the information that would be on this page. I would expect to be in that PDF. - **P15**

> You know, quite honestly. You know VA has a bad name. They got a bad rap. It's you know. It didn't come on right away. It's not gonna go away right away. But people feel that, you know, if they if this information goes away, they can't see it. That therefore, doesn't exist anymore. And you know, having sometimes having that piece of paper is just a level of comfort that a person can have cause, they got that information. - **P8**

>  I'm going to save this in case we need it or have to go over it or resubmit it. Cause I'm not trying to fill out in more information all over again. - **P14**

> You know I would save it. So I would have a copy of what's going on that way. I don't have to keep going to the website to do it, you know. that's a pretty secure way of doing it. Because, you know, most people don't shred their information, or whatever you just store it in a garbage. And that's a great way of being hacked. So that's why I save everything on my devices. - **P19**


### Finding 3
Veterans found the 'What to Expect Next' section valuable, and would want to highlight the timeline for immediate expectations and the rest of the process.

![Screenshot 2024-03-27 at 1 17 41 PM](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/111457818/0a6e7c66-adee-4869-a0ed-080bb3e44494)

Majority of Veterans called out the note about 7-10 days and use it as a guidance for their immediate next action. If they don’t see their appeal in the status tool within that time range, they would call. Many Veterans also expect the next steps to include more details about how long the entire process should take.

> I’ve known, and I've worked with Veterans that don't live in areas where they can access internet and phones on a daily basis. So being able to know a timeline that I could expect to have information available because I'm gonna you know, just sit in their shoes. I would have to go into a town or another area more populous to get any sort of access. I would want to know that cause it's not always practical for some people. - **P11**

> We're always left wondering how they're gonna reach out to you and obviously, a paper trail is always good.  - **P16**

> What's going to happen next? And that's always good. Yeah. Cause you don't know. People just don't know. - **P1**

> I would love to say, explain to me what those 7 to 10 days are are those business days or those week days, you know. I know government holidays are quite extensive, I would imagine. For example, I don't have President's Day off, but I imagine the Government does. I would really like it was explained, to have like a pop up, you know, some sort of calendar link API.
 - **P11**

> It's gonna take 7 to 10 busy days. So you don't have to worry, because you know. Oh, well, it's not up there, and it's not up there, you know. You get a basic timeline of when it's going to be up there. - **P19**

> There's nothing about how long it takes. The only thing I saw was that said 7 to 10 days to get it into the system nothing, about 90 days. 5 years. You know what kind of backlog, and I know that varies. I know it varies. You have different people in different states, and that was told. If I'd lived in Louisiana at the time I originally filed, I would been on. but would have been on disability then. but not in Arkansas. - **P18**


### Finding 4
Veterans using screen readers expect multiple methods of contact, and prefer being notified by email.

![Screenshot 2024-03-27 at 1 18 18 PM](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/111457818/c766c354-f13f-4054-b740-5a63e2ee6996)

![Screenshot 2024-03-27 at 1 18 39 PM](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/111457818/56f0a971-ff32-4283-86d5-0d955fefbb6d)


Veterans with vision impairment are looking for inclusivity when it comes to the ways VA is contacting them. A Veteran mentioned that the language surrounding a package being “mailed” to the Veteran lacks options for blind Veterans who would prefer a different method of contact. Another Veteran mentioned that knowing how and when the VA will contact them will help them filter the important correspondence and phone calls from other spam mail or robo calls.

> They'll mail back a submission packet, and there's some verbiage that we have had get established that is supposed to have this provided in alternative means, and not just default back over to, hey? You're gonna send me a paper document that's actually supposed to be a phone call. It says, Blind person like, yeah, don't mail it to me. Give it to me in a format that I could otherwise use. - **P7**

> It was bred in to me a long, long time ago to believe in backups for everything. especially when it comes to the VA. I learned a long time ago that when it comes to voice messages and the mail that if you don't keep a backup once, it's leaves your hands, there's really there's no proof or record. And I guess that's why I fell in love with email cause there's always a paper trail. - **P16**

> How the information is going to be sent out, especially for blind and low vision, to know is how to be looking forward because we get so many Robo calls, too. If I'm not, don't know the number that's gonna be coming up. - **P3**

> I'm looking at this. And when I see it says, “we will contact you, but we need more information.” But it's not we're saying, how you gonna contact me. Is it going to be by phone or email or mail? And I'm taking this from a low vision, or blind person’s standpoint because a lot of times they say they mailed you something, and you overlook it in the mail, because a lot we get so much junk mail, you might overlook it, so I always like to know which way they're sending it, or if you can end up in my spam or something, especially with something as important as your claim. - **P3**

> Maybe there was a how and why would you contact it. You wanna know the status or don't agree with the status, so on so forth. I know I would. I would personally love a more direct phone number other than the general line. But I understand that that's not always possible. But yeah. The only part that I think is perhaps could be clarified a bit is the what to expect next? - **P11**

> This would be one where it'd be great if yeah, we had some options on how we wish to receive that information, but other than that, everything else was pretty good with it. - **P7**

### Finding 5
Veterans use headings and search to navigate a page, wanting the H1 to be more descriptive of the page, and a mixed reaction to the use of lower level headings.

![Screenshot 2024-03-27 at 1 20 57 PM](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/111457818/7985a4a7-24fa-4e96-bd24-5fc4376d353d)

Veterans were impressed by our use of headers to describe sections, but wished that the H1 was more descriptive of the page itself, instead of just the form name. A few Veterans found that the use of H5s for form questions may be excessive, since it doesn't help them navigate the page.

> Once you mentioned the headings, sometimes the headings are great, sometimes headings are bad. It's easier to hit next heading, then to search. Sometimes I'll also pull up a taggable of links on the page, or all the headings you. - **P18**

> I might almost say here (in the form details), we have too many headings -- I don't personally like headings in forms that much. I prefer they have the form labels. I don't know why headings in forms: it's just more I have to listen to. I'm not the most patient in the world. Even a level 5, I'm still reading it with the letter H. I don't personally do H1 or H2 -- I just do H to get to the section I want to go to without listening to all the other crap. I expect headings to get me to sections, not to actual individual items. - **P5**

> I think that, yeah, that looks like very in depth and not cluttered. Hmm. so yeah, some people go overboard with headings, and almost every line has a heading on it. Th, that that sounds to me like pretty good it would got, you know, could get through the same just in a very few seconds to what I wanted. - **P18**

> So I'm just gonna go and say, just couple the things are just more of a screen. Reader Mac OS, voiceover type things where it kind of it didn't exactly read off the text initially, but I knew that there was text there. So that's why you heard me go back and forth. Otherwise, you know most of the information there is quickly, easily structured. Maybe a little bit too heavy-handed on the headings cause it's almost like every other line is a heading. - **P7**

> Yeah. Just looking at them again. Verbiage. bringing that information upfront, I mean even Thank you for submitting, even that, if that's your main heading level one and get rid of the other 2 and just kind of flop those around that would make a little bit more sense. - **P7**

### Finding 6
Veterans using screen readers expect to receive PDFs from VA and rely on alternate methods to read them when they’re inaccessible.

Experienced screen reader users aren't fond of inaccessible PDFs that are comprised of a single image. They find ways to work around making the content legible by copying the content to a document, printing and running it through OCR, or having someone else help the convert the file.

> I'm gonna stick with PDFs I'm not gonna move off it. Its what people are looking for. - **P7** 

> Some of them [PDFs] are good. Some of them are paying I usually run have to end up running them through a OCR To read unless they're the kind that actually has the detection embedded in the PDF file. - **P18**

>You can take that PDF file and store that. Although I hate PDF files. [why?] Because JAWS doesn't read them. Yeah, to convert word to read it. here's my wife usually comes in helps with that, but I know we can convert PDF to work. - **P4**

> Okay, but that was one of the ones I was gonna work on is converting that over which is just a pain, and sometimes we do get them from you know, VA, or wherever and it'll be JPG, or it'll be an image, or whatever. Yeah, that's a document. But it's not a document that's accessible. I would save the attachment to download folder. So now I would then go to the Internet. Go to Adobe, bring it over it. It's a pain in the butt. I don’t do it too often. - **P8**

> PDF is fine. If when they do it, they use the accessibility side of it. But if they don't. jaws usually does a pretty good job nowadays of just scanning it, anyway. But sometimes it's impossible. Still. - **P5**

## Additional Insights
1. Veterans with visual impairments rely on family or caregivers for file management and storage.
> I'll set up a file for it. and probably have probably have a paper copy with this somewhere, I'm sure got it letter, and then my wife files it away and or the file folders. - **P4**

> I have an assistant that comes in. Make sure that everything is in the folder and stuff like that. - **P2**

> When I fill out paperwork with VA on the computer. I'm not doing the navigation by myself, as you can tell with the computer, you have to know what keys to press, so usually I get help. So, my son, since he's visual, he will go on answer the questions. - **P14**

2. There are multiple barriers around gathering and submitting digital evidence 
   * Not self-reporting medical issues during service
   * FOIA requests being returned as large stacks of paper documents or on CDs
   * Needing to familiarize with the digitizing and uploading process
> A couple years ago I made a request for a copy of my medical records and they sent back 2 envelopes about 3 inches thick. I don't need to go back to when it was the sixties. - **P11**

> I mailed in the evidence because there were  medical records from other providers so I mailed it in instead of doing it online because I didn't have digital copies of it. - **P15**

> I send stuff all the time, cause I can't see. I have to trust what people send me, and I have to send it back and forward it, and so on and so forth. So when we use websites like this where we can upload, I have to pay attention to what kind of file it is, cause I know it'll get kicked back if you don’t know the difference between a Jpeg and a PDF and all that. It starts off as French to me, but then, in the end it starts getting drilled into your head. And you pay attention to all those little letters at the end of a a document cause it seems like, everybody wants to pick their favorite and leave all the other ones out. - **P16**

> ROI offices are not allowed to give you anything in a flash drive or emails for security reasons they give it to you in a CD, Is that compatible or you to upload them to these forms on on a computer. - **P16**

3. Blind Veterans recommend the My VA app to manage their claims because of the ease of login, navigation, and use with screen readers.
> Health and benefits app now is a godsend. and in that I can get in there. Look at benefits, look at their claim letters and see where it is that way. But as far as actually filing appeals and things like that, it's more or less our national staff that will do that. - **P8**

> As I said surprisingly, I figured I had to go find I found my password and all of that which is stored but then, when I went in it was face ID had already set up, and bingo I was in. - **P1** 

4. Reader mode hides certain components, rendering the page inactionable.

One Veteran went through the prototype using Reader mode on Safari. In Reader mode, we saw that a few of the important components were hidden. These included: alert, PDF download link, telephone number, and buttons.

## Recommendations
1. Give Veterans multiple options to save a copy of their submission, including through email.
2. Set clearer expectations about the process under What to Expect Next, and move immediate, time-related information higher on the confirmation page.
3. Provide clear methods of communication and contact, both to VA and from VA, such as, giving more information about what phone number or email VA would be contacting Veterans from.
