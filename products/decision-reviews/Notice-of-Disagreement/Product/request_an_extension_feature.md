## Outcome Summary
> *Brief statement describing opportunity you're pursuing e.g. "Increase Use of Search Tools on VA.gov." Include measurable outcome (i.e. metric) you're trying to affect.*

- The latest PDF version of the Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) form allows Veterans to request an extension and confirm if they are appealing a denial of benefits by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). This update to the VA.gov form brings it into parity with the PDF version.

## Problem
> *Describe the challenge / pain point you seek to address.:* 
* Veterans with good cause need the ability to request an extension when filing a Notice of Disagreement with the Board of Veteran's Appeals (BVA).
* The PDF version of the form includes this field as a checkbox with the option to attach a good cause reason on a separate piece of paper. VA.gov form does not have this field. 

## Desired User Outcomes
- As a Veteran filing a Notice of Disagreement on VA.gov, I want the ability to request an extension when I submit my form, so I can file after my 1-year deadline has passed. 

## Undesired User Outcomes
- As a Veteran filing a Notice of Disagreement on VA.gov, I do not want to use an older version of the form, that doesn't contain teh latest input fields. 

## Desired Business Outcomes
- As a BVA stakeholder, I want the latest version of the VA.gov form to match what's available on the current paper form, to reduce the risk of negative consequences caused by appeals submitted using outdated form versions. 

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- As a BVA stakeholder, I do want to lose any important information related to a Veterans notice of disagreement, which could in turn introduce legal risk for the BVA.

- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - Veterans will understand how to use the new form fields and will not exit the form due to confusion.
- **Technical Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
  - None
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - Compliance requirements

### What're you building
