# Appeal PDF Download Initiative Brief

---

## Outcome Summary
> *Brief statement describing opportunity you're pursuing e.g. "Increase Use of Search Tools on VA.gov." Include measurable outcome (i.e. metric) you're trying to affect.*
* Today, when Veterans file an appeal on va.gov, there is no way for them to maintain a record of their submission. To increase Veteran trust of the reliability of our products, we want to provide the ability to download a PDF copy of a submitted appeal, so veterans can store it in their personal records.

## Problem
> *Describe the challenge / pain point you seek to address.:* 
* Usability and design, experimentation, testing conducted with Veterans indicates that most expect to be able to download a copy of their submitted claim for their records. During research, many veterans expressed difficulty maintaining personal records, and simultaneously expressed distrust of va.gov's website because of a fear of data loss. 
* The reason for Veteran distrust in VA.gov services frequently points to site performence and their past experiences with VA healthcare and previous claims. Many veterans expressed challenges getting access to their records and finding data that they expected the VA to keep on file. Others expressed challenges meeting deadlines due to lost correspondence letters or other communications that slipped through the cracks. Although the reasons vary across factors related and unrelated to va.gov, we believe we can improve trust by providing Veterans with a record they can keep.
* This initiative helps further OCTO-DE's goal of making the claimant experience better by ensuring that application and decision review workflows set clear expectations about the process.

## Desired User Outcomes
- As a Veteran, I want the ability to download a copy of my submitted appeal, so that I know my appeal was successfully submitted.
- As a Veteran, I want to know exactly what date and time I submitted my appeal, so that I can keep it in my personal records.
- As a Veteran, I want to know which issues I added to a claim, so I can keep track of what I've filed.

## Undesired User Outcomes
- As a Veteran, I do not want to be mislead when downloading a copy of my claim, such that I believe it was successfully submitted when it was not.
- As a Veteran, I do not want to mistake the copy of my claim for a paper version that I need to mail, which could cause longer development time due to duplicate filing.
  
## Desired Business Outcomes
- *Why would your business want this to exist?*
- *With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*

## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks
> *Identify risks related to usability, value to users, feasibility/implementation, and viability given organizational constraints<sup>2</sup>. 
> Indicate how you'll validate/test against these risks. Inspired by [SVPG's Four Big Risks](https://www.svpg.com/four-big-risks/).*

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - Prior user research for Decision Reviews and Claim Status Tool have shown us that Veterans are expecting a way to keep a record of what they submitted.
- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - This replaces the current CTA to 'Print this page for confirmation'
  - The risk is if Veterans believe they need to submit the downloaded PDF, but we've included measures (watermark) that clearly states the copy is not for submission. 
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
  - Examples:
    - Upstream/Downstream API/Data availability and reliability
    - Site performance impacts (see [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse), [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/), #-daily-lighthouse-scan)
  
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - Examples: 
    - VA stakeholder testing, marketing, compliance requirements 

### What're you building
> *What's in scope for you to build with this initiative? Describe key features/flows. 
> *What have you explicitly decided to **not** include and why?*
> *How does this solution address your Assumptions & Risks?

- Scope of this build is to make edits for the submission confirmation page for all three decision review forms (Supplemental Claims, Notice of Disagreement/Board Appeal, Higher-Level Review), starting with Board Appeal and link to an already created endpoint that lets users download a print version of the confirmation page and a copy of their completed form.
- Lighthouse has created an endpoint that adds a watermark to the completed PDF package.
