# SME Discovery and Review 

08-2023 Benefits CE Decision Reviews

## Background

Our team is working on the second version of the form, and iterating based on opportunities identified through evaluative research.

## Intake
**SME:** William Bo Rollins & Valerie Tolson
- How does the intake team use the area of disagreement?
- If the user identifies their area of disagreement as 'something else', can the claim still be processed?
  - Does that impact the time it takes to process the claim?
- How does the intake team process additional explanation provided on a separate sheet of paper?
  - Does the format for this additional explanation impact the time it takes to process the claim?
  - What do the explanations typically look like?
  - Do Veterans typically include one explanation for the entire appeal, or do they provide separate explanations for each issue?

## Legal
**SME:** Angeline DeChiara
- Deadline + contested claims, are the plain language modifications acceptable?
- Area of disagreement, are there examples of other areas of disagreement, and can we provide them?
- Board Review Options: What kind of clarifying information can we show Veterans? 
- Reason for extension: What is the definition of ‘good cause’ and are there examples we can provide?
