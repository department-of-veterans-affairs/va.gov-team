Intro
-----

Good morning/afternoon and thank you for joining us today.

I have a few things I need to mention before we start:

-   The session should take up to one hour. 

-   In this call you'll be entering or reviewing personal information, and submit an actual Notice of Disagreement.We will be using a live VA form, you can use this form to submit a Notice of Disagreement.

-   If you need a break or want to stop the session at any time, please let me know.

Screening
---------

OK, let's get started.

Today we're going to submit a Notice of Disagreement (NOD). First I have a few questions to make sure this is the right form for your situation:

-   I need to confirm: are you a Veteran (separated from Active duty?) And do you have an existing claim decision that you would like to appeal to the Board of Veteran Appeals.

-   If "no," end the session.

-   Is the date on the decision letter less than one year old?

-   If "no," end the session.

-   Can you confirm that you have a VA.gov account? And do you know your username and password?

-   If not: Are these easy to get? Could you get them?

-   If the user can not remember or retrieve their login credentials, end the session.

-   Are you ready to submit a Notice of Disagreement and do you have the info or documents you need at hand?

-   During this call, I will ask you to fill out and submit the form, and we will be looking for any technological issues that need to be fixed. Are you comfortable walking through the form on the call?

-   If not, end the session.

If you choose, you can turn off video when entering any information you want to keep private. We're not recording this session, but we need to see your screen as you go through the form. Are you comfortable sharing your screen?

-   If not: Explain this is necessary for testing. If they are still unwilling (e.g. because of personal info), end the call.

OK, please share your screen, and we'll get started.
