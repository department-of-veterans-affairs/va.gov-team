### Background

This is a bug test (UAT test) of the online version of NOD (Notice Of Disagreement, also called a Board Appeal). 

What is NOD? As a veteran, I should fill out and submit a Notice of Disagreement if I have received a decision from a local VA office or a higher-level adjudicator with which I disagree, and I would like one or more issues to be decided by a Veterans Law Judge. 

I can choose to appeal all or only some of the issues previously decided, however, ONLY those issues that I list on my Notice of Disagreement will be considered. I need to appeal within 1 year after the date on the decision letter.

### Goals

The goal of User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is to determine if a user can submit a Notice of Disagreement successfully, and fix any bugs and resolve any technical issues or blocks that exist.  

### Method

We'll do the UAT remotely using Zoom. Participants will log into their VA account, step through the wizard, then complete the NOD form. Remote observers may be in attendance. 

We will use NOD in production. We need users email in advance, in order to be able to white list them and enable them to use NOD in staging.

#### Success criteria

Users will:

-   Navigate to the form

-   Log in with VA credentials.

-   Navigate through the form

-   Review and submit the form

-   Form will successfully submit for processing

#### The process

-   There will be a quick introduction to UAT

-   The user will log into VA.gov

-   The user will submit a Notice of Disagreement

### Participants & recruiting

Participants will be recruited via Perigean. Notes are not necessary during UAT.

Sessions will run up to 60 minutes, depending on potential technical issues; sessions should be scheduled for 60 minutes, and at least 30 minutes apart.

Recruit for a minimum of 5 fulfilled sessions using the following criteria:

Must have for participants:

-   The veteran must be ready to submit a NOD for a claim decision in the session.

-   This means that they have received a decision from a local VA office or a higher-level adjudicator with which they disagree, and they would like one or more issues to be decided by a Veterans Law Judge. 

-   The date on their decision letter needs to be less than one year.

-   The participants need to be Veterans (separated from active duty) 

-   They need to have at hand their (working) VA login credentials. 

Examples: Do you have a DSLogon Premium, a MHV premium, or ID.me identity verified account?
(if they do not know what that means, ask: Do you ever sign into any va websites, such as VA.gov or ebenefits, to access or apply for your benefits? (If yes: Can you talk me through how you do that? -- hopefully they'll tell you something like "I click on the MHV button" or "I click on the DS Logon button")).

-   They need to have an existing claim decision that they would like to appeal to the Board of Veteran Appeals.

-   They need all necessary info and documents at hand, as well as any additional medical reports or supporting evidence.

-   They need the name for their representative or VSO. 

-   They must provide a list of issues they'd like to contest.

#### Recruitment requirements

-   We need their email (associated with VA.gov) in advance, so that we can white list them for the production environment.

-   They must know how to log in to VA.gov with their VA login credentials. 

-   Participants must be on a desktop. 

-   The participants must have Zoom downloaded prior to the session

-   The participants know how to screen share in zoom and find links in the chat.

#### Team Availability

Please allow 30 minutes between sessions.

Please schedule max 2 participants the first test day (June 2, 2021)
