### Background

This is a bug test (UAT test) of the online version of NOD (Notice Of Disagreement, also called a Board Appeal). 

What is NOD? As a veteran, I should fill out and submit a Notice of Disagreement if I have received a decision from a local VA office or a higher-level adjudicator with which I disagree, and I would like one or more issues to be decided by a Veterans Law Judge. 

I can choose to appeal all or only some of the issues previously decided, however, ONLY those issues that I list on my Notice of Disagreement will be considered. I need to appeal within 1 year after the date on the decision letter.

### Goals

The goal of User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is to determine if a user can submit a Notice of Disagreement successfully, and fix any bugs and resolve any technical issues or blocks that exist.  

### Method

We'll do the UAT remotely using Zoom. Participants will log into their VA account, step through the wizard, then complete the NOD form. Remote observers may be in attendance. 

We will use NOD in production. We need users email in advance, in order to be able to white list them and enable them to use NOD in staging.

#### Success criteria

Users will:

-   Navigate to the form

-   Log in with VA credentials.

-   Navigate through the form

-   Review and submit the form

-   Form will successfully submit for processing

#### The process

-   There will be a quick introduction to UAT

-   The user will log into VA.gov

-   The user will submit a Notice of Disagreement

### Participants & recruiting

Participants will be recruited via Perigean. Notes are not necessary during UAT.

Sessions will run up to 60 minutes, depending on potential technical issues; sessions should be scheduled for 60 minutes, and at least 30 minutes apart.

Recruit for a minimum of 5 fulfilled sessions using the following criteria:
