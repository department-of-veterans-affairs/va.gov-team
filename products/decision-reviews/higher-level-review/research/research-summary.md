Unicorns, Higher Level Review Research, January 2020

## Goals
- The Higher Level Review (HLR) flow has been tested before, but several changes has been made (some due to technical requirements) since then, so a new round of Usability testing was needed. 
- HLR as a product has changed designers several times and their last updates needed to be implemented and tested.
- We wanted to test an Invision prototype of the HLR flow with 8-10 veterans, in order to identify successes, usability issues and pain points. 

## Background

### [Research Plan](/research-plan.md)

### [Conversation Guide](/conversation-guide.md)

Veterans are using the Claim Status tool to submit their Decision Review forms. This creates a problem because the forms get stored in the eFolder, without an EP code for tracking and does not notify anyone of their existence. Therefore, Decision Review form could go unnoticed indefinitely. This issue was identified during a conversation with RVSR (rater inside VA).

We're unable to find data that helps us understand how frequently this issue is happening. Therefore, we're doing this research learn more about where Veterans expect to be able to file appeals on VA.gov and how we might improve the current Claim Status tool so that appeal forms are not uploaded there.





# Methods

### Dates

- We conducted 9 qualitative interviews (usability studies) between 15 - 22 January 2020.
- These were all task-oriented, semi-structured interviews done remotely via the Zoom app. 
- We used this [InVision prototype](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/PMVHSE4DRN6#/screens/400541600) for our testing, referring to the VA.gov website.


### Participants

- We interviewed 9 users. One participant (P3) was an outlier and was removed from the analysis.
- There was a good spread in age, gender and geographic location between the participants.
- We interviewed 5 female and 4 male.
- All users had submitted a claim before. Several users had done or started a HLR review before.  

### Hypotheses
- Certain terms and use of language in the HLR flow may confuse veterans (i.e. legacy appeals, opt-out, etc).
- Opt-out page could potentially alarm users because it is a deliberate and forced action to proceed in submitting the HLR process. (Users need to feel 100% confident that they know all the consequences of this action before moving forward).  

### Research questions
- What usability issues remains in the latest HLR flow?
 - Are there any confusing steps in the HLR flow?
 - Are each steps clearly defined or self-explanatory?
 - Does the user organically move from step to step?
 - Does the user needs more information in order to feel confident to move forward?
 - Are there other questions or concerns the user has while completing the HLR process?
- Is there any confusing or ambiguous language in the HLR flow?


# Key Findings

**Overall users found the flow to be simple & straightforward, but with some unclear and confusing steps.** 



**Intro page:** Users are confused about the info on the Opt out process and the rules about New Evidence.

**Opt Out page:** All participants are confused about this page. In order to continue the flow, they want to know the implications, the benefits (of new process), and what claim(s) they are actually opting out from.

**Add Notes page:** Users think this page is for uploading new evidence. When they see link: What if I have new evidence,  they still expect to upload new evidence here. Confused about the purpose of this page.

**Same Office page:** Participants are confused about this page. Users want the contextual info to be available upfront. Reading the info, users think their choice will not matter. (“VA will do what they want”).

**Informal Conference page:** Users think they are scheduling the conference here. They assume they will receive a call the next couple of days with a time for the conference. Users want to choose day(s) of week,  a range of dates, an option to contact both representative and themselves, and an option to add an alternate phone number.

###Additional Findings

**Review application:** Users want a  Print or Save button. Some users expected to see their name and a receipt or appeals number on top of the Review page. 

**Submit page:** users like that they can track the status. Users want a  Print or Save button. User suggestion:  "Please allow at least ... days before checking the Claim status." A few users would like an email in addition to a phone number. 

Users are very positive to be able to complete the HLR process 100% online.

All users want to avoid calling VA. Users expect 45-60 minutes initial wait time to get through, and then several hours on the phone. They want alternatives to a phone call (email, chat).


# Recommendations

**Intro page:** Increase visibility of, and add info about New Evidence and Opt out process. Move info about New Evidence up to the first paragraph. Add info box or F.A.Q. (e.g. Why should I opt out? What are the implications?) for the Opt out process and the rules for New Evidence in the HLR process.

**Opt out page:** Move to the Contested issues page to provide contextual info. (This idea came from Riley O.).  Users needs to know what specific claim they opt out from. (Or at the very least add info: Opt out is for the issues / claims that you will choose when going through  this flow).

**Add notes page:** Users are confused about the purpose of this page, when they understand (with our guidance)  that it’s not for new evidence. Consider removing from flow (Legal requirement?). If this step is needed copy needs to be reworked for clarity.

**Same office page:** Remove preselection and move contextual info to the top of page. Users since are confused about the purpose of this step. Consider removing from the flow (Legal requirement?). If this step is needed, copy needs to be reworked for clarity.

**Informal Conference page:** clarify through copy and potentially new design elements that this step is only to schedule a call to book a conference. Add an option to contact both a representative and themselves. Allow users to add an alternate phone number. Remove "Senior Reviewer" in contextual info box. 

**Contact Info page:** When user edits Contact Info, allow them do auto update on all VA systems, at least their Profile Page.

**Contested Issues page:** *“Don’t see issue”* link: remove “Pension”. 

**Review application page** and **Submit application page:** add button for print and save. Consider sending a confirmation email for the Submit page.
