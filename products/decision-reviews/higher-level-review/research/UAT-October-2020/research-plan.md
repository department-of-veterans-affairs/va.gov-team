# **Research Plan for UAT for HLR**

## **Goals**

1. **What product &amp; team are you doing this research for?**

The Benefits and Memorials 1 team has created an online version of the Higher-Level Review form (VA form 20-0996) and will now be conducting user-acceptance testing.

Note that the Veterans will submit a real Higher-Level Review during the session. We will request AMO representatives to be present during the application process.

1. **Background: Briefly, what is the background of this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?**

If a veteran disagrees with the VA&#39;s decision on their claim, they can request to do what&#39;s called a &#39;Decision Review&#39;. In essence, this is an appeal of the decision they received on their initial claim. There are 3 types of decision reviews:

1. Higher Level Review
2. Supplemental Claim
3. Notice of Disagreement (or board appeal)

We will be testing our Higher-Level Review tool on va.gov.

**What is a Higher-Level Review?**

If a veteran disagrees with VA&#39;s decision on their claim, they can request to have a senior reviewer take a new look at their case. The reviewer will determine whether the decision can be changed based on a difference of opinion or an error. A Veteran cannot submit new evidence with a Higher-Level Review. Rather, only the evidence that has been submitted with the original claim may be considered.

1. **Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?**

- Can veterans request a Higher-Level Review on VA.gov?

1. **Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research?**

- Veterans will be able to successfully apply online for a HLR.

## **Method**

1. **What method of research are you planning?**

- Moderated UAT.
- These sessions will not be recorded.

1. **Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?**

- This is the only way we will be able to catch technical issues in real time and diagnose on the frontend of the website.

Specifically, we want 6 participants: The 6 Veterans must understand that they are submitting a real HLR request, be eligible for said request, and have all the necessary documents ready for the UAT sessions.

1. **Where are you planning to do your research?**

- Through Zoom

1. **What will you be testing?**

- The Higher-Level Review request / application process.

## **Participants and Recruitment**

1. Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?

We would like 6 participants who MUST meet the following criteria:

- Participants must have a DS Logon account.
- **Participants must have a desire to apply for / request a Higher-Level Review of their disability claim.**
- Participants must have all documents needed to apply for a Higher Level Review, (to contest at least _one_ claim decision or a supplemental claim decision).
- Participants must be able to see the content on the screen clearly and hear the moderator clearly.
- Participants should not have to use a screen reader or other assistive devices.
- Participants must be on a computer (not a phone or a tablet etc.)
- Participants should be comfortable using Zoom on their computer, and be able to locate the chat function and the share function.

Nice to have requirements:

- Good spread in demographics.
- Good spread across different levels of &quot;tech-savviness&quot;.
