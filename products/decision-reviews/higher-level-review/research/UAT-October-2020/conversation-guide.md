## **Intro - 2 minutes**

Thanks for joining us today! My name is ______ and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we&#39;re going to talk about Higher-Level Review (HLR). A Veteran that wants to dispute a decision they received on a claim, can file a Higher-Level Review, were a more senior, experienced reviewer take a look at the case and the evidence they already provided.

This meeting has several observers as you may have noticed.  These are members of the technical team (in case of technical issues) and stakeholders (experts in Higher Level Review that work for the Office of Adminstrative Review, which is responsible for appeals and decision reviews.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

Before this was just a paper form but we have created a digital version and today we will be testing out that functionality. Our goals for the session are:
- To test out the functionality of our new digital HLR form and catch any bugs or technical issues throughout the process, and
- To have you file a real higher-level review of your disability compensation claim. Again this will be a real Higher-Level Review request with the VA, so we want to emphasize that. If we cannot successfully file your HLR request then we will be sure to give you another way to do so. 
Some other things to note:
- The entire session should last 60 minutes or less (HLR is a relatively short form). Throughout the process if you would like to stop the session or discontinue for any reason, that is totally fine - just let me know. 
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. If you find anything unclear or confusing, we want to hear about it. Your honest feedback will help us improve the veteran experience, and of course we will not be offended by any opinions you express. Weâ€™re testing the product - not you.

Does that all sound good?

## **Warm-up/Screener Questions - 3 minutes**

OK, let&#39;s get started.

1. Have you heard of Higher-Level Review (HLR) before today?
2. Great, next, I&#39;d like to confirm: You are ready to apply for a HLR today and have all the necessary information available?

- If no, the participant can not complete the UAT. (Confirm/probe if they seem confused.)

1. Can you confirm for me that you have a DS Logon?
2. Do you know your username and password?

- If not: Are these readily accessible?
- If the user can not remember or retrieve their login credentials, end the session.

1. Can you tell me what type of computer you are using today?

- If needed: I&#39;m asking this question because sometimes the type of computer can affect your experience with the tools. Knowing which one you are using will help our developers make adjustments if needed.
- Can you tell me which web browser you are using?

1. Today we are going to observe you interacting with the new tools on your computer. Would you feel comfortable sharing your screen with me at this time?

- If no: Explain this is necessary for testing. If they are still unwilling, end the session.

(Pass presenter rights).

OK, please share your screen, and then we will get started.
