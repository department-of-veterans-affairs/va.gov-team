# Higher-Level Review - Call Center Video Script

## Introduction

Welcome! Have you ever wondered what a veteran or their representative does when they disagree with VA’s decision on a claim? Well, there are a few ways the decision can be contested - this is called a decision review. Today, we’ll talk about the process of requesting a Higher-Level Review - or ‘HLR’ - for short.  We’ll go over the basics as well as walking through the online version of the Higher-Level Review form - so let’s get started.

### What is a Higher-Level Review?

As previously described, 

If a Veteran or their representative disagrees with the VA’s decision, they can request to have a senior reviewer take a new look at their case. The reviewer will determine whether the decision can be changed based on a difference of opinion or an error.

**A Higher-Level Review can be requested on:**

An initial claim, or
A supplemental claim

**It cannot be requested on:**
A previous Higher-Level Review on the same claim (no stacking)
A board appeal on the same claim 
A contested claim (though these are rare)


### How do you request a Higher-Level Review?

You can request a higher level review in a few ways. 

**Via the paper form**
You can download the paper form by opening your browser and entering this address into the URL bar of your browser window or in a search engine:

https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-20-0996-ARE.pdf

**Via the online form**
To access the online form, visit va.gov and navigate to the disability section of the website. When you’re there, scroll down until you see the section entitled ‘Manage your Veterans disability benefits’. Click on the link that says ‘Request a decision review or manage a legacy appeal’. Once in the decision review section of our website, scroll down to the section entitled ‘Request a decision review or appeal’ and choose the link called ‘Decision review option: Higher-Level Review’. You’re now on our information page for how to request a Higher Level review.
About halfway down the page, you’ll see a green button that says ‘start the higher level review request.’ click on that to begin the process.

### The online form Wizard

You will be brought to a page that will ask a few simple questions to determine your eligibility for using this form. 

The first question asks ‘For what type of claim are you requesting a Higher-Level Review?’ At this time, only disability compensation claims are eligible for the online form process. If you select ‘a claim other than disability compensation’, the system will give more information on how you can file a Higher Level Review for that claim. Otherwise, the system will reveal the next question to determine eligibility. 

It then asks ‘Is this claim going through the legacy appeals process?’ At this time, opting out of the legacy appeals process requires the paper form, so the system will instruct you on how to do this and offer a download link for the paper form. If the claim you are requesting is not part of the legacy appeals process, you can move forward by clicking ‘no’ here.

To continue, click the green button.

### HLR Introduction Page

On the introduction page of the Higher Level Review form, the system will prompt you to log in. Click the ‘sign in or create an account’ button to begin the process. If you have an account, enter your username and password. You will then be prompted to enter a mobile phone number where you can receive a 6-digit confirmation number. When you receive the confirmation number, be sure to enter it on the login screen. Upon entering this information, you should be redirected back to the Higher Level Review introduction page.

Now that you’ve been redirected to the introduction page, click the ‘start the request for a higher level review’ button to begin the process.


### Basic Information

Once inside the form, you will see your personal details. If any of this is incorrect, please contact Veterans Benefits Assistance at 800-827-1000. If everything looks correct, click the continue button.

### Contact Information

Next, you will have the opportunity to review your contact details. If any of this is incorrect, you can update the information on your profile page by clicking the link on the page. Otherwise, hit continue.

### Contested Issues

On this screen, you will be able to select the issues you would like the VA to review. Please select at least one issue. If you do not see the issue you’re looking for, you can click on the dropdown link below the list of issues. It will outline all the possible reasons for why an issue may not display here. When you have selected all of the issues you would like to have reviewed, you can click continue.


### Office of Review

If you’d like, you can request that the same office that made the previous decision conduct this review. This may not always be possible, but the VA will make an effort to fulfill your request. In either scenario, your case will be reviewed by another individual and considered separately from your original decision. Please choose either ‘yes’ or ‘no’ here and click continue.

### Informal Conference

On this screen, you’re given the option to request a phone call between yourself or your accredited representative and the reviewer to discuss why you believe the decision should be changed and identify factual errors - this is called an Informal Conference. It’s important to note that two calls will occur during this process. First, the VA will call the specified individual to determine a date and time for the actual informal conference call to occur. The second call will be the informal conference. Please select one of the options below and click continue.

#### If you select call my rep

**Rep details**

When you select ‘call my representative’, you will be asked to fill in a few more details so the VA is able to get into contact with your representative. Please provide your representative’s name and phone number on this screen, then click continue.

**Rep availability**

Next, you will be asked to indicate the availability of your representative to receive a phone call. The purpose of this call is to set up a time to conduct the informal conference - not availability for the informal conference itself. This just ensures that the VA calls at a time when your rep is available to receive a phone call. Here, you can select up to two times periods when your rep is available. Once you’ve made your selection, please hit continue.




#### If you select call me


Next, you will be asked to indicate your availability to receive a phone call to set up the informal conference. The purpose of this call is to set up a time to conduct the informal conference - so you’re not indicating your availability for the informal conference itself. This just ensures that the VA calls at a time when you’re available to receive a phone call. Here, you can select up to two times periods that work for you. Once you’ve made your selection, please hit continue.


### Review Page

On the review page, you’ll have the opportunity to review the information and confirm the accuracy or edit as needed. To review the details, simply click on one of the labeled boxes to expand. If you need to edit the information, click the ‘edit’ button located in the top right corner of the information box. It will make the content within editable, so you can make your changes on the fly. When you’re finished, click ‘update page’ and it will automatically be saved for you. When everything looks good, you’re ready to review the privacy policy. Acknowledging that you’ve read and accept the privacy policy is required in a checkbox above the submit button. When everything is accurate and complete, click the ‘submit application’ blue button at the bottom of the page.

### Submission Page

The submission page confirms that you have submitted your application for a higher level review. We advise that you print this page for your own records. Be sure to track the progress of your submission using our claims and appeals status tool. For Higher-Level Reviews, please wait at least 7-10 business days for your claim to appear in the claim and appeals status tool.

This concludes the process of submitting a Higher-Level Review application online. Thank you and have a great day!
