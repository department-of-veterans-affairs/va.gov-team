# I. PRODUCT OVERVIEW

## What is the Decision Reviews Onramp tool?

The Decision Reviews Onramp is an **interactive online questionnaire** that helps Veterans identify which decision review pathway is most appropriate for their situation. It's designed to reduce confusion and help Veterans make confident decisions about how to contest unfavorable VA decisions on disability compensation claims.

**Key Features:**
- **Unauthenticated:** Veterans don't need to log in to use it
- **Plain language:** Questions and explanations use simple, clear wording
- **Personalized:** Recommendations based on the Veteran's specific answers
- **Guided:** Provides context and help throughout the process
- **Direct access:** Links directly to the appropriate form after recommendation

**How to Access:**
- **URL:** [PLACEHOLDER: Insert production URL for Onramp tool]
- **From VA.gov:** [PLACEHOLDER: Insert navigation path from VA.gov homepage]

**Scope:**
- **IMPORTANT: Disability compensation decision reviews ONLY**
- Does *not* support other benefit types (education, pension, etc.)
- For initial claims or supplemental claims already filed

## Why this tool exists

Veterans face significant challenges when choosing between decision review options. Research and data show:

**The Problem:**
> "Veterans sometimes struggle to choose the right decision review option for their unique needs, which can result in delays and unfavorable decisions. Veterans aren't consistently able to identify the differences between options, their eligibility, and if it will give them the chance at a favorable outcome."
> *— Enhanced DR Onramp Initiative Brief*

**Current Data (Before Onramp):**
- **43.9% form abandonment rate** overall (Veterans start but don't complete forms)
- **4.8% pathway switching rate** (Veterans submit multiple different decision review types)
- Individual pathway abandonment:
  - Supplemental Claims: 54.3%
  - Higher-Level Review: 37.1%
  - Board Appeal: 40.9%

**What Veterans Tell Us:**
From qualitative research and Medallia feedback:
- Hard to find and understand pathway information
- Difficult to determine relevance to their specific situation
- Confusion about evidence requirements
- Unsure which option gives them the best chance of success
- Often rely on outside help but don't know where to turn

## Goals and success metrics

**Desired Outcomes:**
- Reduce confusion-driven pathway switching by 10-20%
- Improve form completion at decision points by 15-25%
- Decrease same-day duplicate submissions by 20-35%
- Reduce burden on Contact Center and VSOs

**For Contact Center:**
- Fewer calls from confused Veterans
- Better prepared Veterans (who used tool before calling)
- Clear escalation path when tool doesn't meet needs

# II. BACKGROUND: WHAT IS A DECISION REVIEW?

## Overview

When a Veteran disagrees with a VA decision on their claim, they have the right to request a decision review. Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), there are **three pathways** available:

1. **Supplemental Claim** (VA Form 20-0995)
2. **Higher-Level Review** (VA Form 20-0996)
3. **Board Appeal** / Notice of Disagreement (VA Form 10182)

**Critical Deadline:** Veterans must file within **one year** of the date on their decision letter.

## Quick comparison of the three pathways

| Feature | Supplemental Claim | Higher-Level Review | Board Appeal |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Form Number** | VA Form 20-0995 | VA Form 20-0996 | VA Form 10182 |
| **New Evidence?** | Required | *Not* allowed | Optional |
| **Who Reviews** | Different reviewer at local office | Senior reviewer at same or different office | Board of Veterans' Appeals (judges) |
| **Average Timeline** | ~125 days | ~125 days | 400+ days (varies by docket) |
| **Best For** | Veterans with new, relevant evidence | Veterans who believe there was an error but have no new evidence | Veterans who want Board-level review and are willing to wait |
| **Informal Conference** | No | Optional phone call with reviewer | Hearing option available |
| **Can Stack?** | No - can't file multiple SCs for same issue | No - can't file multiple HLRs for same issue | No - can't file NOD while other DR pending |

## Important rules all Veterans should know

### Cannot mix and match
- Veterans can't have multiple decision reviews pending for the same issue
- Must choose ONE pathway
- If they choose wrong, [PLACEHOLDER: Policy on withdrawing and refiling]

### Evidence is the key differentiator
The most common confusion point is **evidence requirements:**

- **Have new evidence?** = Supplemental Claim
- **No new evidence, think there's an error?** = Higher-Level Review
- **Want Board to decide?** = Board Appeal

**CRITICAL POINT FOR CC:**
Higher-Level Review does *not* allow new evidence. This is the #1 source of confusion. If a Veteran has new evidence, they should file a Supplemental Claim instead.

# IV. THE THREE DECISION REVIEW PATHWAYS (DETAILED)

## Pathway 1: Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995)

### When to use it

Use when Veteran has **new and relevant evidence** - information not previously submitted to VA that could change the decision.

**Examples:** New medical records, buddy statements, private treatment records, medical opinion linking condition to service.

### What happens

1. Veteran submits form with new evidence (or tells VA where to get it)
2. Different reviewer examines original evidence plus new evidence
3. Issues new decision

**Timeline:** ~125 days [PLACEHOLDER: Confirm current processing time]

**How to access:** [PLACEHOLDER: URL] or link from Onramp recommendation

### Key points for Contact Center

**New evidence means:**
- VA hasn't reviewed it before for this claim
- Could help prove or disprove the claim
- Can be documents Veterans submit OR records they ask VA to obtain

**When to recommend:** Veteran says they have new information, medical records, or additional documentation.

**Red flag:** "I don't have new evidence, VA just got it wrong" = Higher-Level Review instead

### Common questions

**"What counts as new?"** Evidence you didn't previously submit for this claim.

**"Can I add more after filing?"** [PLACEHOLDER: Yes, within timeframes - insert policy]

**"What if I don't have it yet?"** Indicate on form where VA can get it, or use VA Form 21-4142 to authorize record requests.

---

## Pathway 2: Higher-Level Review (VA Form 20-0996)

### When to use it

Use when Veteran believes there was an **error** in the decision but has **NO new evidence** to submit.

**Examples:** VA misread evidence, overlooked information already in file, made error in judgment or policy application.

### Critical requirement: *No new evidence*

**Most important point:** Higher-Level Review does *not* allow new evidence. This is the #1 source of confusion.
- Cannot submit new medical records, statements, or documentation
- **If Veteran has new evidence = Supplemental Claim instead**

### What happens

1. Veteran submits form (no evidence allowed)
2. Senior reviewer examines case for errors or difference of opinion
3. Can only consider evidence already in file
4. Optional: Informal conference call with Veteran
5. Issues new decision

**Timeline:** ~125 days [PLACEHOLDER: Confirm current processing time]

**How to access:** [PLACEHOLDER: URL] or link from Onramp recommendation

### Key points for Contact Center

**Informal conference (optional):**
- Phone call with senior reviewer to point out errors or overlooked evidence
- Not a formal hearing - informal discussion
- Two calls: (1) scheduling call, (2) actual conference

**When to recommend:** Veteran says "VA made a mistake" or "they didn't understand my evidence" AND has no new evidence.

**Red flag:** "I have new documents/records" = Supplemental Claim instead

### Common questions

**"What if I have new evidence?"** File Supplemental Claim instead - HLR doesn't allow new evidence.

**"What is an informal conference?"** Optional phone call to discuss why you think the decision was wrong and point out errors. You must request it on the form.

**"My doctor wrote a new letter - can I use it?"** New letter = new evidence. File Supplemental Claim instead.

---

## Pathway 3: Board Appeal / Notice of Disagreement (VA Form 10182)

### When to use it

Use when Veteran wants **Board of Veterans' Appeals** (a Veterans Law Judge) to review their case and is willing to wait longer.

**Timeline warning:** Board Appeals average 400+ days (over 1 year) - *much* longer than SC or HLR. Make sure Veterans understand this trade-off.

### Three review options (dockets)

Veteran must choose ONE:

**1. Direct Review** (fastest Board option)
- No new evidence, no hearing
- Board reviews existing record only

**2. Evidence Submission**
- Can submit new evidence within 90 days after VA receives NOD
- No hearing

**3. Hearing**
- Virtual or in-person hearing with Veterans Law Judge
- Can submit new evidence at or before hearing
- Longest wait time
- Opportunity to testify

### What happens

1. Veteran submits Notice of Disagreement (Form 10182) with docket choice
2. VA processes and dockets the appeal
3. Veterans Law Judge reviews and makes decision
4. Decision is final (next step: Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims)

**Timeline:** 400+ days average [PLACEHOLDER: Confirm by docket type]

**How to access:** [PLACEHOLDER: URL] or link from Onramp recommendation

### Key points for Contact Center

**When to recommend:** Veteran specifically wants judge to decide, willing to wait, wants to testify, or previous SC/HLR was denied.

**Red flag:** "I need a decision quickly" = SC or HLR instead (both ~125 days vs 400+ days)

**Medallia feedback highlight:** Veterans appreciate space on Board Appeal form to explain disagreement and want issues not on the list to be addressable.

### Common questions

**"Why so long?"** Board reviews appeals nationwide in order received. While longer, you get a Veterans Law Judge decision.

**"What's the difference between the three options?"**
- Direct = fastest, no evidence, no hearing
- Evidence = add evidence within 90 days, no hearing
- Hearing = testify to judge + add evidence, slowest

**"Can I explain why I disagree?"** Yes - form has space to explain for each issue, plus Hearing option lets you explain in person.

**"Need faster decision due to hardship?"** [PLACEHOLDER: Priority processing guidance/escalation path]

# V. ASSISTING VETERANS WITH THE ONRAMP TOOL

## When Veterans should use the tool

**Recommend when:**
- Veteran just received decision letter and disagrees
- Unsure which pathway is right
- Asks "Which form should I file?"

**May not help when:**
- Claim is *not* disability compensation
- Veteran prefers human guidance or has urgent need

**Always appropriate:** Suggest contacting an accredited representative for personalized advice

## Walking a Veteran through the tool

**Script:**
> "I can direct you to a tool that will ask questions about your situation and recommend the best decision review pathway. It uses plain language and explains as you go. When done, it recommends a pathway and links to the form. Would that be helpful?"

**URL:** [PLACEHOLDER: Production URL]

**Key points:**
- No login required, mobile-friendly
- Takes 5-10 minutes
- One question per page with help text
- Branching logic = different questions based on answers

## How the tool works

**For complete question-by-question reference**, see: `onramp-questionnaire-complete-reference.md` and `onramp-decision-tree.md`

### Two-section structure

**Section 1: Eligibility screening (3-5 questions)**
- Decision received? Timeline? Contested claim?
- Determines basic eligibility for decision reviews

**Section 2: Pathway-specific (varies by answers)**
- Service connection, condition changes, evidence, law changes, hearing preference
- Different questions appear based on Veteran's situation

### Key question types

**Evidence** (appears multiple times):
- "Do you have new and relevant evidence?"
- Evidence = information VA hasn't considered before that could help prove/disprove claim

**Service connection:**
- "Did we decide your condition is service connected?"
- Help text includes PACT Act examples

**Claim type** (critical branching point):
- "What type of decision do you want us to review?"
- Creates different paths for Initial/SC/HLR/Board decisions

**Hearing preference:**
- "Do you want a hearing with a Veterans Law Judge?"
- Explains timeline trade-off (~2 years with hearing vs ~1 year without)

## Understanding the recommendation

**Tool shows:**
- Recommended pathway with explanation
- Why it fits their situation
- Timeline and key details
- Direct link to form

**Alternative result:** If ineligible for decision review, tool explains why and suggests alternatives (file initial claim, contact VSO, etc.)

**If Veteran questions recommendation:**
> "The tool based this on your answers. You can review your answers and try again, contact an accredited representative for personalized guidance, or choose a different pathway - the tool is a guide, not a requirement."

**Note:** Veterans can't save/print results, but can bookmark page or screenshot. Tool provides all info needed to proceed.

## Common Veteran questions about the tool

**"Do I have to use this tool?"**
No - completely optional. Go directly to any decision review form if you know which one. Tool helps if you're unsure.

**"Does this file my appeal for me?"**
No - tool recommends and links to form, but you still complete and submit the form. Tool is a guide, not a filing method.

**"Are my answers saved?"**
[PLACEHOLDER: Does tool save progress? For how long? Login required?]

**"Different recommendation than expected?"**
Tool bases recommendation on your answers. You can retry with different answers, choose a different pathway, or contact an accredited representative for personalized advice.

**"Tool says Supplemental Claim but I don't have new evidence?"**
"New" = anything not previously submitted for this claim. Examples: medical records after decision, new statements, new medical opinions, private treatment records VA doesn't have. If unsure, contact accredited representative.

**"Can I use this for education/pension claims?"**
No - Onramp only works for disability compensation decision reviews. [PLACEHOLDER: Guidance for other claim types]
