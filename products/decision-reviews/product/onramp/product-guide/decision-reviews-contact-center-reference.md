# I. PRODUCT OVERVIEW

## What is the Decision Reviews Onramp tool?

The Decision Reviews Onramp is an **interactive online questionnaire** that helps Veterans identify which decision review pathway is most appropriate for their situation. It's designed to reduce confusion and help Veterans make confident decisions about how to contest unfavorable VA decisions on disability compensation claims.

**Key Features:**
- **Unauthenticated:** Veterans don't need to log in to use it
- **Plain language:** Questions and explanations use simple, clear wording
- **Personalized:** Recommendations based on the Veteran's specific answers
- **Guided:** Provides context and help throughout the process
- **Direct access:** Links directly to the appropriate form after recommendation

**How to Access:**
- **URL:** [PLACEHOLDER: Insert production URL for Onramp tool]
- **From VA.gov:** [PLACEHOLDER: Insert navigation path from VA.gov homepage]

**Scope:**
- **IMPORTANT: Disability compensation decision reviews ONLY**
- Does *not* support other benefit types (education, pension, etc.)
- For initial claims or supplemental claims already filed

## Why this tool exists

Veterans face significant challenges when choosing between decision review options. Research and data show:

**The Problem:**
> "Veterans sometimes struggle to choose the right decision review option for their unique needs, which can result in delays and unfavorable decisions. Veterans aren't consistently able to identify the differences between options, their eligibility, and if it will give them the chance at a favorable outcome."
> *— Enhanced DR Onramp Initiative Brief*

**Current Data (Before Onramp):**
- **43.9% form abandonment rate** overall (Veterans start but don't complete forms)
- **4.8% pathway switching rate** (Veterans submit multiple different decision review types)
- Individual pathway abandonment:
  - Supplemental Claims: 54.3%
  - Higher-Level Review: 37.1%
  - Board Appeal: 40.9%

**What Veterans Tell Us:**
From qualitative research and Medallia feedback:
- Hard to find and understand pathway information
- Difficult to determine relevance to their specific situation
- Confusion about evidence requirements
- Unsure which option gives them the best chance of success
- Often rely on outside help but don't know where to turn

## Goals and success metrics

**Desired Outcomes:**
- Reduce confusion-driven pathway switching by 10-20%
- Improve form completion at decision points by 15-25%
- Decrease same-day duplicate submissions by 20-35%
- Reduce burden on Contact Center and VSOs

**For Contact Center:**
- Fewer calls from confused Veterans
- Better prepared Veterans (who used tool before calling)
- Clear escalation path when tool doesn't meet needs

# II. BACKGROUND: WHAT IS A DECISION REVIEW?

## Overview

When a Veteran disagrees with a VA decision on their claim, they have the right to request a decision review. Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), there are **three pathways** available:

1. **Supplemental Claim** (VA Form 20-0995)
2. **Higher-Level Review** (VA Form 20-0996)
3. **Board Appeal** / Notice of Disagreement (VA Form 10182)

**Critical Deadline:** Veterans must file within **one year** of the date on their decision letter.

## Quick comparison of the three pathways

| Feature | Supplemental Claim | Higher-Level Review | Board Appeal |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Form Number** | VA Form 20-0995 | VA Form 20-0996 | VA Form 10182 |
| **New Evidence?** | Required | *Not* allowed | Optional |
| **Who Reviews** | Different reviewer at local office | Senior reviewer at same or different office | Board of Veterans' Appeals (judges) |
| **Average Timeline** | ~125 days | ~125 days | 400+ days (varies by docket) |
| **Best For** | Veterans with new, relevant evidence | Veterans who believe there was an error but have no new evidence | Veterans who want Board-level review and are willing to wait |
| **Informal Conference** | No | Optional phone call with reviewer | Hearing option available |
| **Can Stack?** | No - can't file multiple SCs for same issue | No - can't file multiple HLRs for same issue | No - can't file NOD while other DR pending |

## Important rules all Veterans should know

### Cannot mix and match
- Veterans can't have multiple decision reviews pending for the same issue
- Must choose ONE pathway
- If they choose wrong, [PLACEHOLDER: Policy on withdrawing and refiling]

### Evidence is the key differentiator
The most common confusion point is **evidence requirements:**

- **Have new evidence?** = Supplemental Claim
- **No new evidence, think there's an error?** = Higher-Level Review
- **Want Board to decide?** = Board Appeal

**CRITICAL POINT FOR CC:**
Higher-Level Review does *not* allow new evidence. This is the #1 source of confusion. If a Veteran has new evidence, they should file a Supplemental Claim instead.

# IV. THE THREE DECISION REVIEW PATHWAYS (DETAILED)

## Pathway 1: Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995)

### When to use it

Use when Veteran has **new and relevant evidence** - information not previously submitted to VA that could change the decision.

**Examples:** New medical records, buddy statements, private treatment records, medical opinion linking condition to service.

### What happens

1. Veteran submits form with new evidence (or tells VA where to get it)
2. Different reviewer examines original evidence plus new evidence
3. Issues new decision

**Timeline:** ~125 days [PLACEHOLDER: Confirm current processing time]

**How to access:** [PLACEHOLDER: URL] or link from Onramp recommendation

### Key points for Contact Center

**New evidence means:**
- VA hasn't reviewed it before for this claim
- Could help prove or disprove the claim
- Can be documents Veterans submit OR records they ask VA to obtain

**When to recommend:** Veteran says they have new information, medical records, or additional documentation.

**Red flag:** "I don't have new evidence, VA just got it wrong" = Higher-Level Review instead

### Common questions

**"What counts as new?"** Evidence you didn't previously submit for this claim.

**"Can I add more after filing?"** [PLACEHOLDER: Yes, within timeframes - insert policy]

**"What if I don't have it yet?"** Indicate on form where VA can get it, or use VA Form 21-4142 to authorize record requests.

---

## Pathway 2: Higher-Level Review (VA Form 20-0996)

### When to use it

Use when Veteran believes there was an **error** in the decision but has **NO new evidence** to submit.

**Examples:** VA misread evidence, overlooked information already in file, made error in judgment or policy application.

### Critical requirement: *No new evidence*

**Most important point:** Higher-Level Review does *not* allow new evidence. This is the #1 source of confusion.
- Cannot submit new medical records, statements, or documentation
- **If Veteran has new evidence = Supplemental Claim instead**

### What happens

1. Veteran submits form (no evidence allowed)
2. Senior reviewer examines case for errors or difference of opinion
3. Can only consider evidence already in file
4. Optional: Informal conference call with Veteran
5. Issues new decision

**Timeline:** ~125 days [PLACEHOLDER: Confirm current processing time]

**How to access:** [PLACEHOLDER: URL] or link from Onramp recommendation

### Key points for Contact Center

**Informal conference (optional):**
- Phone call with senior reviewer to point out errors or overlooked evidence
- Not a formal hearing - informal discussion
- Two calls: (1) scheduling call, (2) actual conference

**When to recommend:** Veteran says "VA made a mistake" or "they didn't understand my evidence" AND has no new evidence.

**Red flag:** "I have new documents/records" = Supplemental Claim instead

### Common questions

**"What if I have new evidence?"** File Supplemental Claim instead - HLR doesn't allow new evidence.

**"What is an informal conference?"** Optional phone call to discuss why you think the decision was wrong and point out errors. You must request it on the form.

**"My doctor wrote a new letter - can I use it?"** New letter = new evidence. File Supplemental Claim instead.

---

## Pathway 3: Board Appeal / Notice of Disagreement (VA Form 10182)

### When to use it

Use when Veteran wants **Board of Veterans' Appeals** (a Veterans Law Judge) to review their case and is willing to wait longer.

**Timeline warning:** Board Appeals average 400+ days (over 1 year) - *much* longer than SC or HLR. Make sure Veterans understand this trade-off.

### Three review options (dockets)

Veteran must choose ONE:

**1. Direct Review** (fastest Board option)
- No new evidence, no hearing
- Board reviews existing record only

**2. Evidence Submission**
- Can submit new evidence within 90 days after VA receives NOD
- No hearing

**3. Hearing**
- Virtual or in-person hearing with Veterans Law Judge
- Can submit new evidence at or before hearing
- Longest wait time
- Opportunity to testify

### What happens

1. Veteran submits Notice of Disagreement (Form 10182) with docket choice
2. VA processes and dockets the appeal
3. Veterans Law Judge reviews and makes decision
4. Decision is final (next step: Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims)

**Timeline:** 400+ days average [PLACEHOLDER: Confirm by docket type]

**How to access:** [PLACEHOLDER: URL] or link from Onramp recommendation

### Key points for Contact Center

**When to recommend:** Veteran specifically wants judge to decide, willing to wait, wants to testify, or previous SC/HLR was denied.

**Red flag:** "I need a decision quickly" = SC or HLR instead (both ~125 days vs 400+ days)

**Medallia feedback highlight:** Veterans appreciate space on Board Appeal form to explain disagreement and want issues not on the list to be addressable.

### Common questions

**"Why so long?"** Board reviews appeals nationwide in order received. While longer, you get a Veterans Law Judge decision.

**"What's the difference between the three options?"**
- Direct = fastest, no evidence, no hearing
- Evidence = add evidence within 90 days, no hearing
- Hearing = testify to judge + add evidence, slowest

**"Can I explain why I disagree?"** Yes - form has space to explain for each issue, plus Hearing option lets you explain in person.

**"Need faster decision due to hardship?"** [PLACEHOLDER: Priority processing guidance/escalation path]

# V. TOP 10 COMMON CONFUSION POINTS

*Based on external veteran feedback, VSO testimony, and government oversight reports*

This section addresses the most frequent points of confusion that Contact Center staff should be prepared to clarify when assisting Veterans with decision reviews.

## 1. "New and Relevant Evidence" Definition ⚠️ CRITICAL

**The Confusion:**
Veterans think "new" means "recently created" or "recent medical records."

**The Reality:**
"New" means **not previously submitted to VA for this claim** - even if it's decades old.

**How to Explain:**
> "New evidence means anything VA hasn't reviewed before for this specific claim. That could include:
> - Old medical records you never sent us
> - A new doctor's opinion based on your existing records
> - Buddy statements from people who knew you during service
> - Private treatment records we don't have
>
> It doesn't have to be recently created - a 20-year-old medical record you just found counts as 'new' if we haven't seen it before."

**Common Misconception to Address:**
- Photos/videos are usually given very little weight as evidence
- "New" doesn't mean "additional" - it means "not previously in your file"

## 2. Higher-Level Review "No New Evidence" Rule ⚠️ CRITICAL

**The Confusion:**
This is the **#1 confusion point** across all sources. Veterans file HLR and try to submit evidence, or avoid HLR when they should use it.

**The Reality:**
HLR does **NOT** allow any new evidence - no medical records, no statements, no documents.

**How to Explain:**
> "Higher-Level Review is ONLY for situations where you think VA made an error with the evidence already in your file. You CANNOT submit:
> - New medical records
> - New statements
> - New documents of any kind
>
> If you have new evidence, you need to file a Supplemental Claim instead. HLR is for pointing out errors VA made with what they already had."

**Red Flags to Watch For:**
- Veteran says "I have a new doctor's letter" → Supplemental Claim, not HLR
- Veteran says "I want to submit more records" → Supplemental Claim, not HLR
- Veteran says "VA just didn't understand my evidence" but has no new evidence → HLR is correct

**Fear to Address:**
Veterans fear HLR reviewer can reduce their other ratings. **This is false.** Explain: "The reviewer only looks at the specific issue you're appealing, not your entire rating."

## 3. Board Appeal Timelines - Expectation vs Reality

**The Confusion:**
Veterans see "300-400 days" but experience 3-5 years actual wait time.

**The Reality:**
Board Appeals commonly take **much longer** than stated timelines, especially with hearing option.

**How to Explain:**
> "While VA's goal is around 400 days for Board Appeals, actual wait times are often longer - sometimes 2-5 years depending on which option you choose:
> - Direct Review: Fastest Board option
> - Evidence Submission: Moderate wait
> - Hearing: Often 2+ years because you're waiting for a hearing slot with a judge
>
> If you need a decision faster, Supplemental Claim or Higher-Level Review both average around 125 days."

**Financial Hardship Guidance:**
If Veteran reports homelessness, severe financial hardship, or terminal illness, explain expedited processing may be available. [PLACEHOLDER: Insert expedite request procedure]

## 4. Decision Letters Are Hard to Understand

**The Confusion:**
30% of VA decision letters contain errors (per DAV testimony). Letters test at college reading level, not 8th grade.

**The Reality:**
Veterans genuinely struggle to understand denial reasons and appeal options.

**How to Explain:**
> "Decision letters can be complex. The key things to look for are:
> - **Effective date**: When your benefits would start (check this carefully - VA sometimes gets it wrong)
> - **Denial reason**: What evidence was missing or why you didn't meet criteria
> - **Appeal deadline**: One year from the date on the letter
>
> If you're confused, that's completely normal. Free help is available from Veterans Service Organizations who can translate the letter for you."

**Recommend VSO Strongly:**
Given 30% error rate and complexity, **strongly recommend VSO assistance** for understanding decision letters.

## 5. Duty to Assist - VA Should Help You Get Evidence

**The Confusion:**
42% of claims have duty-to-assist failures (per American Legion). Veterans don't know VA has a legal obligation to help obtain evidence.

**The Reality:**
VA must help you get federal records (military, VA medical, Social Security) if you tell them where to look.

**How to Explain:**
> "VA has what's called a 'duty to assist' - we're required to help you get federal records like:
> - Your military service records
> - VA medical records
> - Social Security records
>
> You can use VA Form 21-4142 to authorize us to request records from private doctors. You don't have to get everything yourself - we should be helping you."

**When to Suspect Duty-to-Assist Error:**
- Veteran says "VA denied me for lack of evidence but never asked for my records"
- Veteran says "I told them where my records were but they didn't get them"

## 6. Pathway Switching and Delays

**The Confusion:**
Veterans don't understand why their HLR shows "closed" and a supplemental claim was opened.

**The Reality:**
VA can move claims between pathways if they find duty-to-assist errors or evidence was submitted with HLR.

**How to Explain:**
> "Sometimes VA will move your claim to a different pathway. Common reasons:
> - You filed HLR but included evidence → VA moves it to Supplemental Claim
> - VA found a duty-to-assist error → Claim goes back for development
>
> You should receive a letter explaining why this happened. If your status changed unexpectedly, contact us and we can check what's going on."

**Known Issue:**
16,300 supplemental claims were not established after HLR completion due to software delays (per VA OIG). This is a known system problem.

## 7. Effective Date Errors and Appeals

**The Confusion:**
Veterans don't know to check effective date or that they can appeal it separately.

**The Reality:**
Effective date errors are a **common VA processing mistake** that can cost veterans months or years of backpay.

**How to Explain:**
> "When you receive a decision, check the effective date carefully. This is when your benefits start, which affects how much backpay you receive.
>
> Common VA error: Setting effective date as the date of your new medical exam or supplemental claim filing, instead of your original claim date.
>
> You can appeal the effective date separately from appealing the rating decision itself."

**Red Flag:**
If effective date seems wrong (too recent), strongly recommend VSO review before accepting decision.

## 8. VSO Quality and Availability

**The Confusion:**
VSO quality varies wildly. Some are very helpful, others are unresponsive or give incorrect advice.

**The Reality:**
Not all VSO representatives have equal experience, especially with the AMA system (implemented 2019).

**How to Explain:**
> "Veterans Service Organizations provide free help, and I strongly recommend using one. They can:
> - Help you understand your decision letter
> - Determine which appeal pathway is right
> - Complete forms for you
> - Represent you throughout the process
>
> If you contact a VSO and don't get a response within a reasonable time, it's okay to try a different one. You can work with any accredited representative - American Legion, DAV, VFW, state/county VSOs, or private attorneys."

**Set Expectations:**
VSOs are often overworked. If calls aren't returned, try visiting in person or trying a different VSO chapter.

## 9. Can't File Multiple Pathways for Same Issue

**The Confusion:**
Veterans try to "hedge their bets" by filing SC + HLR + Board Appeal for the same issue simultaneously.

**The Reality:**
You can only have **one decision review pending** for the same issue at a time.

**How to Explain:**
> "You must choose ONE pathway per issue:
> - Can't file Supplemental Claim AND Higher-Level Review for the same denied condition
> - Can't file Board Appeal while HLR is pending for same issue
>
> You CAN file different pathways for different issues from the same decision letter.
>
> If you choose wrong, you can [PLACEHOLDER: withdrawal/switch policy]."

## 10. Expedited Processing for Financial Hardship

**The Confusion:**
Veterans experiencing homelessness or severe financial hardship don't know expedited processing exists.

**The Reality:**
Expedited processing is available for:
- Homelessness or risk of homelessness
- Serious financial hardship
- Terminal illness
- Other serious hardship

**How to Explain:**
> "If you're experiencing homelessness, severe financial hardship, or terminal illness, you may qualify for expedited processing. This can move your appeal faster.
>
> [PLACEHOLDER: Insert specific procedure for requesting expedite - contact info, forms, escalation path]"

**Data Context:**
MyVA411 data shows "majority of calls regarding expediting the process" and veterans citing "drop in income" and "declaring homelessness." This is a real and significant need.

## Quick Reference: "What Veterans Get Wrong"

**Top 5 Misconceptions to Correct:**

1. ❌ "New evidence means recent" → ✅ "New means not previously submitted"
2. ❌ "HLR allows new evidence" → ✅ "HLR does NOT allow any new evidence"
3. ❌ "Board appeals take 400 days" → ✅ "Actually 2-5 years common"
4. ❌ "VA will get my records automatically" → ✅ "You need to tell VA where records are (duty to assist)"
5. ❌ "Photos prove my case" → ✅ "Photos typically given very little weight"

**Top 3 VA Processing Errors to Watch For:**

1. ⚠️ **Effective date errors** (30% of cases ignore favorable evidence per American Legion)
2. ⚠️ **Duty-to-assist failures** (42% of cases per American Legion)
3. ⚠️ **Decision letter errors** (30% error rate per DAV testimony)

**When to Strongly Recommend VSO:**

- Decision letter is confusing (30% contain errors)
- Veteran unsure about evidence requirements
- Complex medical conditions or service connection questions
- Veteran reports possible VA processing error
- Multiple denied claims or appeals

# VI. ASSISTING VETERANS WITH THE ONRAMP TOOL

## When Veterans should use the tool

**Recommend when:**
- Veteran just received decision letter and disagrees
- Unsure which pathway is right
- Asks "Which form should I file?"

**May not help when:**
- Claim is *not* disability compensation
- Veteran prefers human guidance or has urgent need

**Always appropriate:** Suggest contacting an accredited representative for personalized advice

## Walking a Veteran through the tool

**Script:**
> "I can direct you to a tool that will ask questions about your situation and recommend the best decision review pathway. It uses plain language and explains as you go. When done, it recommends a pathway and links to the form. Would that be helpful?"

**URL:** [PLACEHOLDER: Production URL]

**Key points:**
- No login required, mobile-friendly
- Takes 5-10 minutes
- One question per page with help text
- Branching logic = different questions based on answers

## How the tool works

**For complete question-by-question reference**, see: `onramp-questionnaire-complete-reference.md` and `onramp-decision-tree.md`

### Two-section structure

**Section 1: Eligibility screening (3-5 questions)**
- Decision received? Timeline? Contested claim?
- Determines basic eligibility for decision reviews

**Section 2: Pathway-specific (varies by answers)**
- Service connection, condition changes, evidence, law changes, hearing preference
- Different questions appear based on Veteran's situation

### Key question types

**Evidence** (appears multiple times):
- "Do you have new and relevant evidence?"
- Evidence = information VA hasn't considered before that could help prove/disprove claim

**Service connection:**
- "Did we decide your condition is service connected?"
- Help text includes PACT Act examples

**Claim type** (critical branching point):
- "What type of decision do you want us to review?"
- Creates different paths for Initial/SC/HLR/Board decisions

**Hearing preference:**
- "Do you want a hearing with a Veterans Law Judge?"
- Explains timeline trade-off (~2 years with hearing vs ~1 year without)

## Understanding the recommendation

**Tool shows:**
- Recommended pathway with explanation
- Why it fits their situation
- Timeline and key details
- Direct link to form

**Alternative result:** If ineligible for decision review, tool explains why and suggests alternatives (file initial claim, contact VSO, etc.)

**If Veteran questions recommendation:**
> "The tool based this on your answers. You can review your answers and try again, contact an accredited representative for personalized guidance, or choose a different pathway - the tool is a guide, not a requirement."

**Note:** Veterans can't save/print results, but can bookmark page or screenshot. Tool provides all info needed to proceed.

## Common Veteran questions about the tool

**"Do I have to use this tool?"**
No - completely optional. Go directly to any decision review form if you know which one. Tool helps if you're unsure.

**"Does this file my appeal for me?"**
No - tool recommends and links to form, but you still complete and submit the form. Tool is a guide, not a filing method.

**"Are my answers saved?"**
[PLACEHOLDER: Does tool save progress? For how long? Login required?]

**"Different recommendation than expected?"**
Tool bases recommendation on your answers. You can retry with different answers, choose a different pathway, or contact an accredited representative for personalized advice.

**"Tool says Supplemental Claim but I don't have new evidence?"**
"New" = anything not previously submitted for this claim. Examples: medical records after decision, new statements, new medical opinions, private treatment records VA doesn't have. If unsure, contact accredited representative.

**"Can I use this for education/pension claims?"**
No - Onramp only works for disability compensation decision reviews. [PLACEHOLDER: Guidance for other claim types]
