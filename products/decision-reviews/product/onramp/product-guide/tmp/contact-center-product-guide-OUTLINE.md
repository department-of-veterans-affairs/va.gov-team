### C. Common Veteran Questions

#### About the Tool Itself
*Source: Prior research insights*

**Q: "Do I have to use this tool?"**
A: No, the tool is optional. Veterans can go directly to any decision review form. The tool just helps them choose the best option for their situation.

**Q: "Does this tool file my appeal?"**
A: No, the tool provides a recommendation and links to the form. The Veteran still needs to complete and submit the actual form.

**Q: "Will my answers be saved?"**
A: [USER INPUT NEEDED: Confirm if tool saves responses]

**Q: "I'm getting a different recommendation than I expected. Is it wrong?"**
A: The tool bases recommendations on the answers provided. If a Veteran disagrees, they can:
- Review their answers and try again
- Contact an accredited representative for personalized guidance
- Choose a different pathway if they prefer

#### About Choosing a Pathway
*Source: Research findings on Veteran confusion*

**Q: "Which option is fastest?"**
A: Supplemental Claims and Higher-Level Reviews typically take around 125 days. Board Appeals take significantly longer (400+ days). However, the best option depends on the Veteran's situation, not just speed.

**Q: "What if I choose the wrong one?"**
A: [USER INPUT NEEDED: Policy on withdrawing/changing pathway]

**Q: "Can I file more than one type?"**
A: Generally no - you can't have multiple decision reviews pending for the same issue. The tool helps identify the best single pathway.

**Q: "I have new evidence. Which should I choose?"**
A: If you have new and relevant evidence, the tool will likely recommend a Supplemental Claim. Higher-Level Review does NOT allow new evidence.

#### About Evidence
*Source: Medallia feedback - most common confusion*

**Q: "What counts as 'new' evidence?"**
A: Evidence that:
- Was not previously submitted to VA
- Is relevant to your claim
- Could potentially change the decision

**Q: "I already submitted evidence but they didn't consider it. Is that 'new'?"**
A: [USER INPUT NEEDED: Policy clarification]

**Q: "What if I'm not sure if I have new evidence?"**
A: The Onramp tool asks questions to help determine this. If still unsure, recommend contacting an accredited representative.
