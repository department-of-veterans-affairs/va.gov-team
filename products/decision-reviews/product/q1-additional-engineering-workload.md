# Additional Engineering Workload (plan around; not primary goals)

## Q1 2025 Engineering Work Items

| Super epic | Work Item | Intent | Goals & Outcomes | Notes |
|------------|-----------|--------|------------------|-------|
| | Same-day contestable issues | Complete bug fix; evaluate policy/logic changes | **Goal:** Fix timezone discrepancy causing veterans to successfully select same-day contestable issues on the frontend but fail backend validation on submission.<br><br>**Outcomes:**<br>• Veterans can successfully submit decision reviews the same day as decision is issued (electronically notified decisions)<br>• Frontend and backend evaluate `decisionDate` consistently (currently frontend uses veteran's local time, backend uses UTC)<br>• No more production errors from failed submissions due to same-day `decisionDate`s<br>• Proper error messaging if same-day submission is blocked<br>• Backwards compatibility with existing in-progress forms<br>• Coordination complete with Lighthouse on backend logic updates | Sequence to minimize context switching. May lead to plan for redesign of SC Step 2 much the way the date issue triggered a refresh of Step 3 (for design system compliance, etc.). |
| #110583 | DR submission statuses on MyVA | Continue implementation as guidance is received | **Goal:** Display decision review submission statuses on veterans' MyVA dashboard so they can check status without calling.<br><br>**Outcomes:**<br>• Veterans can check submission status for all three DR types (Supplemental Claims, Higher-Level Reviews, Board Appeals) plus evidence submissions<br>• Increased transparency during 7-10 day period before EP is established and claim appears in Claim Status Tool<br>• Status information includes: received by VA, submission in progress, or error occurred<br>• Veterans can self-service instead of calling contact center<br>• Reduced call center inquiries about missing decision reviews<br>• Improved CSAT scores<br>• Follows VA.gov design system patterns for [form submission status](https://design.va.gov/patterns/help-users-to/stay-informed-of-their-application-status#form-submission-status-in-my-va) | Depends on MyVA integration guidance |
| | International phone number support | Scoped fix implemented | **Goal:** Enable veterans with international phone numbers to successfully complete and submit decision review forms.<br><br>**Outcomes:**<br>• Veterans outside US can enter valid international phone numbers in all decision review forms<br>• Phone numbers validate correctly on frontend<br>• International numbers display properly on shared review page (currently broken)<br>• Backend accepts and stores international phone number format<br>• No submission errors due to phone number validation failures | Depends on resolution of:<br>• VA Profile release pushed back, more info expected from PI planning end of month<br>• Issues with displaying int'l phone number correctly on shared review page still persist |
| | Lighthouse Appealable Issues API migration | Plan and execute required updates | **Goal:** Migrate from Lighthouse Decision Reviews API (contestable issues endpoint) to new Appealable Issues API, adopting OAuth authentication and improved terminology.<br><br>**What this API does:** Retrieves the list of issues from veterans' claims that they can appeal (formerly called "contestable issues," now rebranded as "appealable issues")<br><br>**Outcomes:**<br>• OAuth authentication implemented (practice for upcoming Decision Reviews API OAuth migration)<br>• Production credentials obtained and stored in AWS Parameter Store (dev, sandbox, staging, prod)<br>• Feature flag enables seamless toggling between old and new API<br>• No regression in performance metrics (Caseflow targeting 25% latency improvement Q3/Q4)<br>• All existing functionality works identically (transparent to users)<br>• Phased rollout plan executed for gradual traffic migration<br>• Error handling and logging maintained<br>• Tests updated for OAuth flow<br>• **Target:** Lighthouse releasing new API July 15, 2025 | — |

## Summary

These engineering work items support our primary Q1 goals but are not measured as standalone OKRs. They address:

1. **User-facing bugs** (same-day contestable issues, international phone numbers)
2. **Transparency improvements** (MyVA submission statuses)
3. **Technical infrastructure** (Lighthouse API migration)

All work requires cross-team coordination with Lighthouse, MyVA, Caseflow, and VA Profile teams.
