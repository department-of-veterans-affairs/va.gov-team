# I. PRODUCT OVERVIEW

## What is the Decision Reviews Onramp tool?

The Decision Reviews Onramp is an **interactive online questionnaire** that helps Veterans identify which decision review pathway is most appropriate for their situation. It's designed to reduce confusion and help Veterans make confident decisions about how to contest unfavorable VA decisions on disability compensation claims.

**Key Features:**
- **Unauthenticated:** Veterans don't need to log in to use it
- **Plain language:** Questions and explanations use simple, clear wording
- **Personalized:** Recommendations based on the Veteran's specific answers
- **Guided:** Provides context and help throughout the process
- **Direct access:** Links directly to the appropriate form after recommendation

**How to Access:**
- **URL:** [PLACEHOLDER: Insert production URL for Onramp tool]
- **From VA.gov:** [PLACEHOLDER: Insert navigation path from VA.gov homepage]

**Scope:**
- **IMPORTANT: Disability compensation decision reviews ONLY**
- Does *not* support other benefit types (education, pension, etc.)
- For initial claims or supplemental claims already filed

## Why this tool exists

Veterans face significant challenges when choosing between decision review options. Research and data show:

**The Problem:**
> "Veterans sometimes struggle to choose the right decision review option for their unique needs, which can result in delays and unfavorable decisions. Veterans aren't consistently able to identify the differences between options, their eligibility, and if it will give them the chance at a favorable outcome."
> *— Enhanced DR Onramp Initiative Brief*

**Current Data (Before Onramp):**
- **43.9% form abandonment rate** overall (Veterans start but don't complete forms)
- **4.8% pathway switching rate** (Veterans submit multiple different decision review types)
- Individual pathway abandonment:
  - Supplemental Claims: 54.3%
  - Higher-Level Review: 37.1%
  - Board Appeal: 40.9%

**What Veterans Tell Us:**
From qualitative research and Medallia feedback:
- Hard to find and understand pathway information
- Difficult to determine relevance to their specific situation
- Confusion about evidence requirements
- Unsure which option gives them the best chance of success
- Often rely on outside help but don't know where to turn

## Goals and success metrics

**Desired Outcomes:**
- Reduce confusion-driven pathway switching by 10-20%
- Improve form completion at decision points by 15-25%
- Decrease same-day duplicate submissions by 20-35%
- Reduce burden on Contact Center and VSOs

**For Contact Center:**
- Fewer calls from confused Veterans
- Better prepared Veterans (who used tool before calling)
- Clear escalation path when tool doesn't meet needs

# II. BACKGROUND: WHAT IS A DECISION REVIEW?

## Overview

When a Veteran disagrees with a VA decision on their claim, they have the right to request a decision review. Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), there are **three pathways** available:

1. **Supplemental Claim** (VA Form 20-0995)
2. **Higher-Level Review** (VA Form 20-0996)
3. **Board Appeal** / Notice of Disagreement (VA Form 10182)

**Critical Deadline:** Veterans must file within **one year** of the date on their decision letter.

## Quick comparison of the three pathways

| Feature | Supplemental Claim | Higher-Level Review | Board Appeal |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Form Number** | VA Form 20-0995 | VA Form 20-0996 | VA Form 10182 |
| **New Evidence?** | Required | *Not* allowed | Optional |
| **Who Reviews** | Different reviewer at local office | Senior reviewer at same or different office | Board of Veterans' Appeals (judges) |
| **Average Timeline** | ~125 days | ~125 days | 400+ days (varies by docket) |
| **Best For** | Veterans with new, relevant evidence | Veterans who believe there was an error but have no new evidence | Veterans who want Board-level review and are willing to wait |
| **Informal Conference** | No | Optional phone call with reviewer | Hearing option available |
| **Can Stack?** | No - can't file multiple SCs for same issue | No - can't file multiple HLRs for same issue | No - can't file NOD while other DR pending |

## Important rules all Veterans should know

### Cannot mix and match
- Veterans can't have multiple decision reviews pending for the same issue
- Must choose ONE pathway
- If they choose wrong, [PLACEHOLDER: Policy on withdrawing and refiling]

### Evidence is the key differentiator
The most common confusion point is **evidence requirements:**

- **Have new evidence?** = Supplemental Claim
- **No new evidence, think there's an error?** = Higher-Level Review
- **Want Board to decide?** = Board Appeal

**CRITICAL POINT FOR CC:**
Higher-Level Review does *not* allow new evidence. This is the #1 source of confusion. If a Veteran has new evidence, they should file a Supplemental Claim instead.

# IV. THE THREE DECISION REVIEW PATHWAYS (DETAILED)

## Pathway 1: Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995)

### When to use it

A Supplemental Claim is appropriate when:
- Veteran has **new and relevant evidence** that was not previously submitted
- Evidence could potentially change the decision
- Evidence relates to the issues being contested

**Example Scenarios:**
- New medical records showing condition worsened
- Buddy statements not previously submitted
- New medical opinion connecting service to condition
- Private treatment records VA didn't have

### Requirements

**Must Have:**
- New evidence that:
  - Was *not* previously submitted to VA
  - Is relevant to the claim
  - Could potentially result in a more favorable decision

**Timing:**
- Generally within 1 year of decision date
- Can request extension in certain circumstances [PLACEHOLDER: Link to extension request process]

### What happens

1. Veteran submits form with new evidence (or indicates where VA can get it)
2. **Different reviewer** examines the case
3. Reviewer considers original evidence PLUS new evidence
4. Makes a fresh determination
5. Issues new decision

**Timeline:**
Average: ~125 days [PLACEHOLDER: Confirm current processing time]

### Evidence submission options

Veterans can:
- Upload documents directly with the form
- Request VA obtain records (using VA Form 21-4142/4142a)
- Mail evidence separately
- Provide evidence location and VA will attempt to retrieve

### How to access

**Direct URL:**
[PLACEHOLDER: Insert current URL for SC form]

**From Onramp:** Tool will link directly after recommendation

### Common Veteran questions

**Q: "What counts as 'new' evidence?"**
A: Evidence is "new" if you didn't previously submit it to VA in connection with this claim. It doesn't matter if VA might have it for a different reason - if you didn't specifically submit it for this issue, it's new.

**Q: "I submitted evidence but VA didn't look at it. Is that 'new'?"**
A: [PLACEHOLDER: Policy clarification - this is complex and depends on circumstances. May need to escalate.]

**Q: "Can I add more evidence after I submit the Supplemental Claim?"**
A: [PLACEHOLDER: Yes, but within certain timeframes. Insert policy details.]

**Q: "What if I don't have the evidence yet but I know it exists?"**
A: You can submit the form and indicate on the form where VA can get the evidence. You can also use Form 21-4142 or 21-4142a to authorize VA to request private records.

**Q: "My doctor says my condition is worse now. Is that new evidence?"**
A: Yes, new medical records showing your condition has changed or worsened can be new evidence. You would submit those records with your Supplemental Claim.

### When to recommend SC over other options

Supplemental Claim is usually the best choice when:
- Veteran explicitly says they have new evidence
- Veteran describes evidence that sounds new (medical records, statements, etc.)
- Veteran says "VA didn't have all the information"
- Veteran wants to submit additional documentation

**Red Flags for SC:**
- Veteran says "I don't have any new information, I just think they got it wrong" = HLR instead
- Veteran has no evidence and wants judge to decide = Board Appeal instead

---

## Pathway 2: Higher-Level Review (VA Form 20-0996)

### When to use it

A Higher-Level Review is appropriate when:
- Veteran believes there was an **error** in the original decision
- Veteran disagrees with decision but has **NO new evidence** to submit
- Veteran wants a senior reviewer to take a fresh look at the existing record

**Example Scenarios:**
- VA misread or misapplied medical evidence
- VA didn't properly consider evidence that was submitted
- Veteran believes decision maker made an error in judgment
- VA misapplied regulations or policy

### Critical requirement: *No new evidence*

**MOST IMPORTANT POINT ABOUT HLR:**

**Higher-Level Review does *not* allow new evidence.**

This is the #1 source of confusion about HLRs. Emphasize to Veterans:
- Cannot submit new medical records
- Cannot submit new statements
- Cannot add new information that wasn't in original claim file

**If Veteran has new evidence = Use Supplemental Claim instead**

### What happens

1. Veteran submits form (no evidence attachments allowed)
2. **Senior reviewer** (higher level than original decision maker) examines case
3. Reviewer looks for errors or difference of opinion
4. Reviewer can only consider evidence already in the file
5. Optional: Informal conference call with Veteran or representative
6. Issues new decision

**Timeline:**
Average: ~125 days [PLACEHOLDER: Confirm current processing time]

### Office of review option

Veteran can request:
- Same office that made original decision, OR
- Different office

**Note:** VA will try to honor request but it's not guaranteed.

### Informal conference (optional)

Veteran can request a phone call with the senior reviewer to:
- Point out errors in the record or decision
- Identify evidence that may have been overlooked
- Explain why they think the decision was wrong

**Important:** This is *not* a formal hearing. It's an informal discussion.

**Process:**
1. Veteran requests conference on form
2. Can choose to participate themselves OR have representative participate
3. Provides preferred phone number and times
4. **Two calls occur:**
   - **First call:** VA calls to schedule the actual conference
   - **Second call:** The informal conference itself

### How to access

**Direct URL:**
[PLACEHOLDER: Insert current URL for HLR form]

**From Onramp:** Tool will link directly after recommendation

### Common Veteran questions

**Q: "What if I have new evidence?"**
A: Then Higher-Level Review is *not* the right choice. File a Supplemental Claim instead, which allows and requires new evidence.

**Q: "Can I explain my side of the story?"**
A: You can request an informal conference to discuss the case, but you can't submit new evidence. The conference is to point out errors or things the reviewer should pay attention to in the existing record.

**Q: "Can I request a specific office review my case?"**
A: You can request either the same office that made the original decision or a different office. VA will try to honor your request but it's not guaranteed.

**Q: "What is an informal conference?"**
A: It's an optional phone call between you (or your representative) and the senior reviewer. You can discuss why you think the decision was wrong and point out any errors. It's informal - not a legal hearing. You must request it on the form.

**Q: "What's the difference between Higher-Level Review and Board Appeal?"**
A: Higher-Level Review has a senior VA employee review your case (typically takes ~125 days). Board Appeal has a Veterans Law Judge review it (typically takes much longer, 400+ days). HLR doesn't allow new evidence, Board Appeal does.

**Q: "My doctor wrote a new letter saying the VA got it wrong. Can I use that?"**
A: A new letter from your doctor is new evidence. You would need to file a Supplemental Claim instead of a Higher-Level Review to submit it.

### When to recommend HLR over other options

Higher-Level Review is usually the best choice when:
- Veteran says "I think they made a mistake" or "They didn't understand the evidence"
- Veteran does *not* have new evidence
- Veteran wants faster review (compared to Board)
- Veteran believes decision maker overlooked something already in the file

**Red Flags for HLR:**
- Veteran mentions having new documents = SC instead
- Veteran says "I have more evidence" = SC instead
- Veteran wants a judge to decide = Board Appeal instead

---

## Pathway 3: Board Appeal / Notice of Disagreement (VA Form 10182)

### When to use it

A Board Appeal is appropriate when:
- Veteran wants the **Board of Veterans' Appeals** to review their case
- Veteran is willing to wait longer for a decision
- Veteran may want to submit new evidence (optional)
- Veteran may want a hearing with a Veterans Law Judge (optional)

**Example Scenarios:**
- Veteran wants a judge's decision
- Case is complex and Veteran wants Board-level review
- Veteran wants to submit evidence AND have Board decide
- Previous HLR or SC didn't result in favorable decision

### Timeline warning

**IMPORTANT: Board Appeals take significantly longer**

- Average wait time: 400+ days (over 1 year)
- Varies by docket choice
- Much longer than HLR or SC

**Make sure Veterans understand the timeline trade-off.**

### Three review options (dockets)

When filing a Board Appeal, Veteran must choose ONE of three options:

#### 1. Direct Review
- **Fastest Board option** (relatively)
- Board reviews based only on existing evidence in file
- No new evidence submissions
- No hearing
- Board makes decision based on the record

#### 2. Evidence Submission
- Can submit new evidence
- Deadline: 90 days after VA notifies Veteran that NOD was received
- No hearing
- Board considers existing evidence PLUS new evidence submitted

#### 3. Hearing
- Can request hearing with a Veterans Law Judge
- Can be virtual or in-person (typically virtual now)
- Can submit new evidence at or before hearing
- **Longest wait time** of the three options
- Opportunity to testify and answer judge's questions

### What happens

1. Veteran submits Notice of Disagreement (Form 10182)
2. VA processes and dockets the appeal
3. Depending on option chosen:
   - **Direct:** Board reviews current record
   - **Evidence:** Veteran has 90 days to submit evidence, then Board reviews
   - **Hearing:** Hearing is scheduled, then Board reviews
4. Veterans Law Judge makes decision
5. Decision is final (next step would be Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims)

**Timeline:**
Average: 400+ days [PLACEHOLDER: Confirm current processing times by docket type]

### How to access

**Direct URL:**
[PLACEHOLDER: Insert current URL for NOD form]

**From Onramp:** Tool will link directly after recommendation

### Common Veteran questions

**Q: "Why does Board Appeal take so long?"**
A: The Board of Veterans' Appeals reviews appeals for Veterans nationwide. There are currently [PLACEHOLDER: Insert current # if available] pending appeals, and the Board works through them in the order they're received (with some exceptions for older or priority cases). While it takes longer, you get a decision from a Veterans Law Judge.

**Q: "Can I add information about why I disagree?"**
A: Yes! One of the most common pieces of Medallia feedback is Veterans wanting space to explain their disagreement. On the Board Appeal form, you can explain your areas of disagreement for each issue. If you choose the Hearing option, you can explain in person to the judge.

**Q: "I don't see my issue listed in the form. What do I do?"**
A: [PLACEHOLDER: This is common Medallia feedback. Insert guidance - can they add issues not on the list? What's the process?]

**Q: "What's the difference between the three options?"**
A:
- **Direct Review** = fastest, no new evidence, no hearing
- **Evidence Submission** = can add evidence within 90 days, no hearing
- **Hearing** = can add evidence AND testify to a judge, slowest

**Q: "Can I change my mind about which option I picked?"**
A: [PLACEHOLDER: Insert policy on changing docket selection]

**Q: "What if I need my decision faster because of financial hardship?"**
A: The Board has a process for priority treatment in certain circumstances (homelessness, financial hardship, etc.). [PLACEHOLDER: Insert guidance or escalation path for priority processing requests]

### When to recommend Board Appeal over other options

Board Appeal is usually the best choice when:
- Veteran specifically wants a judge to decide
- Veteran is willing to wait 400+ days for decision
- Veteran wants opportunity to testify (Hearing option)
- Previous HLR or SC was denied and Veteran wants next level of review

**Red Flags for Board Appeal:**
- Veteran says "I need a decision quickly" = HLR or SC instead (much faster)
- Veteran doesn't understand the timeline = Make sure they know it's 400+ days
- Veteran seems to think this is faster = Clarify timelines

### How the tool works: Question flow

The tool asks **different questions based on previous answers** (branching logic). Here's what to expect:

#### Section 1: Eligibility and timeline (first 3-5 questions)

**1. Decision status**
- Asks: "Have we sent you a decision on your claim yet?"
- **If NO:** Tool asks if they filed a disability claim, may need to file initial claim first

**2. Claim decision timeline**
- Asks: "Was your claim decided less than a year ago?"
- **If over 1 year:** Different path (claim for increase options)

**3. Contested claim**

- Includes PACT Act examples

**About condition changes:**
- "Has your service-connected condition gotten worse since you filed this claim?"

**About disagreement:**
- "Do you disagree with any part of our decision?"
- Help text explains: effective date, disability rating, service connection

**About evidence:**
- "Do you have new and relevant evidence?"
- **Important:** This question appears in multiple places depending on path
- Help text explains: must be information VA hasn't considered before AND help prove/disprove the claim

**About law/policy changes:**
- "Are you requesting a review because of a change in law or policy?"
- Help text includes PACT Act examples, court rulings, new laws

**About prior decisions (claim type):**
- "What type of decision do you want us to review?"
- Options: Initial claim, Supplemental Claim, Higher-Level Review, or Board Appeal decision
- **This creates different paths through remaining questions**

**About hearings (if Board Appeal is possible):**
- "Do you want to have a hearing with a Veterans Law Judge?"
- Explains virtual/in-person option and timelines (2 years with hearing, 1 year without)

2. **Click the link** to go to the recommended form
3. **Complete and submit** the form within 1 year of decision date (in most cases)
4. **Contact VSO** if they want help completing the form or understanding the recommendation

**Note for CC:** Veterans cannot save/print results from the tool itself, but they can bookmark the page or take a screenshot. The recommendation includes all the information they need to proceed.

## Common Veteran questions about the tool

### "Do I have to use this tool?"

**Answer:** No, the tool is completely optional. You can go directly to any decision review form if you already know which one you want to file. The tool is just here to help you make an informed choice if you're unsure.

### "Does this tool file my appeal for me?"

**Answer:** No, the tool provides a recommendation and links to the form, but you still need to complete and submit the actual decision review form yourself. Think of the tool as a guide to help you choose - not a way to file.

### "Will my answers be saved if I need to stop and come back later?"

**Answer:** [PLACEHOLDER: Does tool save progress? For how long? Does it require login to save?]

### "I'm getting a different recommendation than I expected. Is the tool wrong?"

**Answer:** The tool bases its recommendation on the answers you provided about your situation. If the recommendation doesn't match what you expected, you can:
- Go through the tool again and double-check your answers
- Choose a different pathway if you prefer
- Contact an accredited representative for personalized advice

Remember, the tool provides guidance based on typical situations, but your case might be unique. If you're uncomfortable with the recommendation, seeking help from a representative is always a good option.

### "The tool is telling me to use Supplemental Claim but I don't think I have new evidence."

**Answer:** The evidence rules can be confusing. "New" evidence means anything you didn't previously submit to VA for this claim - even if it feels like old information to you. For example:
- Medical records from after your original decision
- Statements from people who can support your claim
- New medical opinions
- Private treatment records VA doesn't have

If you're still not sure whether you have new evidence, the tool may recommend consulting an accredited representative.

### "Can I use this tool for [education/pension/other non-disability] claim?"

**Answer:** No, the Onramp tool only works for disability compensation decision reviews. For other types of claims, you would need to [PLACEHOLDER: Insert guidance for other claim types].

# VIII. QUICK REFERENCE

## Decision Tree (Simple)

**Does Veteran have new evidence?**
- **YES** = Supplemental Claim
- **NO** = Continue...

**Does Veteran want a Board-level (judge) decision?**
- **YES** = Board Appeal (warn about 400+ day timeline)
- **NO** = Higher-Level Review

## Key Differences at a Glance

| Question | SC | HLR | Board |
|----------|----|----|-------|
| Can submit new evidence? | YES (required) | NO | YES (optional) |
| How long? | ~125 days | ~125 days | 400+ days |
| Who decides? | Different local reviewer | Senior local reviewer | Veterans Law Judge |
| Best for... | Have new evidence | Think there's an error | Want judge's decision |

## Top 3 Most Confused Points

1. **HLR does *not* allow new evidence** ← #1 confusion point
2. **Board Appeal timeline** is *much* longer (400+ days vs ~125 days)
3. **Cannot file multiple pathways** for the same issue simultaneously

## Scripts for Common Situations

**Veteran has new evidence:**
> "Since you have new evidence, a Supplemental Claim would be the right pathway. The Onramp tool can confirm this and guide you to the form."

**Veteran thinks there was an error but no new evidence:**
> "If you believe there was an error in the decision but don't have new evidence to submit, a Higher-Level Review might be right for you. The Onramp tool can help confirm this."

**Veteran wants fast answer:**
> "Supplemental Claims and Higher-Level Reviews both average around 125 days. Board Appeals take much longer - over a year on average. The Onramp tool will help you choose the option that balances your timeline needs with your situation."

**Veteran is completely confused:**
> "That's completely understandable - these options can be confusing. The Onramp tool was built specifically to help with this. It will ask you questions about your situation and recommend the best pathway. If you'd prefer to talk to someone, I can also give you information on how to find an accredited representative who can provide personalized guidance."
