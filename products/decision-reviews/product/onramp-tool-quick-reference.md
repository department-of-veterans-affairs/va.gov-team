## Key questions explained

### "Do you have new and relevant evidence?"

**New evidence** means:
- Information VA hasn't considered before, AND
- Could help prove or disprove the claim

**Examples:**
- New medical records showing condition worsened
- Buddy statements not previously submitted
- Private treatment records VA doesn't have
- New medical opinion connecting service to condition

**NOT new evidence:**
- Information already submitted with the claim
- Records VA already reviewed

---

### "Did we decide your condition is service-connected?"

**Service-connected** means:
- Got the condition during active duty, OR
- Existing condition got worse due to service, OR
- Developed after service due to something that happened during service (toxic exposure, PACT Act conditions)

Tool includes help text with PACT Act link.

---

### "Are you requesting a review because of a change in law or policy?"

**Examples:**
- PACT Act coverage for toxic exposure
- New court ruling changing how a condition is evaluated
- New law adding eligibility for certain conditions
- VA policy updates for specific claim types

Tool includes PACT Act link in help text.

---

### "What type of decision do you want us to review?"

**4 options:**
1. **Initial claim or claim for increase** - Filed for new condition or to increase rating
2. **Supplemental Claim** - Submitted new evidence after previous decision
3. **Higher-Level Review** - Senior reviewer looked at previous claim
4. **Board Appeal decision** - Veterans Law Judge reviewed the case

**This question creates different paths** through the rest of the tool.

---

### "Do you want a hearing with a Veterans Law Judge?"

**With hearing:**
- Virtual or in-person
- Can submit new evidence during/after hearing
- Average: ~730 days (2 years)

**Without hearing:**
- Judge reviews file only
- Average: ~365 days (1 year)

**Benefits backdated** to request date either way.

## Common Veteran questions

**"Do I have to use this tool?"**
> No, it's optional. You can go directly to any decision review form if you already know which one.

**"Does this file my appeal?"**
> No, the tool recommends a pathway and links to the form. You still need to complete and submit the form.

**"Will my answers be saved?"**
> No, the tool doesn't save progress. Plan to complete it in one session (5-10 minutes).

**"I'm getting a different recommendation than expected."**
> The tool bases recommendations on your answers. You can:
> - Review your answers and try again
> - Choose a different pathway if you prefer
> - Contact an accredited representative for personalized advice

**"Can I use this for my education/pension claim?"**
> No, the tool only works for disability compensation decision reviews.
