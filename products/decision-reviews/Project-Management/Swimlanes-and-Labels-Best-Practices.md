# Swimlanes and Labels: Best Practices

## Swimlanes
### Epics
* Epics are used to define work that spans across several user stories. They are great for tracking a group of user stories, providing background information and desired outcomes. A well defined epic has: clear value, background context, desired outcome(s), success metrics, a definition of ready, and a definition of done. 
* User stories are added to the epic swimlane by default, and should be moved immediately after creation. 
* **Labels: benefits-team-1, squad-2, Epic**

### Discovery 
* The swimlane for ideas. User stories in this swimlane require research (from any discipline). 
* Stories in this swimlane may need a lot of creative iteration and may not end up moving forward. 
* **Lables: benefits-team-1, squad-2, discovery**

### Design
* The swimlane for work that requires context, UX, UI, or other design related work that impacts the visual experience. User stories may start here after research or return here for further refinement. 
* **Labels: benefits-team-1, squad-2, design**

### Product Backlog
* An ordered list of code work and tasks needed to deliver value to users. A living artifact that constantly changes to identify what the product needs to be appropriate, competitive, and useful. 
* User stories in this swimlane may still need refinment before they are ready for the sprint backlog. 
* **Labels: benefits-team-1, squad-2, needs-refinement, needs-estimate**

### Sprint Backlog 
* The set of Product Backlog items selected for the current sprint. This is the plan for delivering the product increment that has been argreed upon for the current Sprint Goal. A forecast about what functionality will be in the next increment and the work needed to deliver that functionality in order for it to be considered "Done". 
* **Labels: Should _not_ contain needs-refinment or needs-estimate labels**

### In Progress
* Any work that is currently being done. This includes tickets that contribute to the sprint goals, bugs, research, design, spikes, prioritized stakeholder requests, and any low hanging fruit that has been pulled into the sprint to be worked on. 
* **Labels: benefits-team-1, squad-2, labels describing the work being done (Check below for some commonly used labels)**

### Validate
* Any ticket that needs to be reviewed by a person other than the one who did the original work. If a problem (or suggestion) is found in this review stage, the ticket is to go back to the "In Progress" swimlane until the changes are ready to be reviewed. Once the reviewer has given final approval, the ticket can be closed. 

### Blocked
* User stories that need intervention ASAP. 

### Closed
* Hooray! The promised land.
