# PTO Process 
## Requesting PTO 

Requesting PTO from our project team is not required, but is strongly encouraged to ensure our project runs smoothly. The process of requesting PTO is as follows: 
* You DM the Delivery Lead (Silke Dannemann) your proposed dates that you'd like to take off
* The Delivery Lead will reach out to the leads to verify it doesn't conflict with other PTO requests or deliverables
* The Delivery Lead will DM you whether its approved or not. If it isn't approved, they will request you move the dates of your PTO for when the team has more coverage
* If approved, please follow the company policy for requesting PTO 

## Post Approval Checklist
Before you leave for PTO, please make sure you have completed this checklist 
- [ ] Add outage to our Shared VA Benefits Google calendar
- [ ] If outage is longer than 3 days, then create an outage doc which should include:
  - [ ] Dates of outage
  - [ ] Meeting coverage (if applicable)
  - [ ] Who will be taking over any In Progress work 
- [ ] Work + Ticket coverage 
- [ ] Sprint review slide presentation (you create slide & ask someone else to present)
- [ ] Set DSVA slack status to OOO with outages dates
- [ ] Set up email vacation responder
- [ ] Block out days on calendar with OOO event (this automatically rejects invitations & lets people know you are unavailable those days) 

**Now go enjoy your PTO!! ðŸŽ‰**
