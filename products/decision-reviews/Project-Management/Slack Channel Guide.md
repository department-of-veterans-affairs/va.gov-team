# (WIP) Slack Channel Guide

## Overview
Welcome to our team's Slack Guide! This guide lays out our most used team channels within our two Slack workspaces; Coforma Space & DSVA (Digital Services @ VA), and explains when to use each channel. This guide is a living document and is subject to change. 

## Coforma Workspace Channels
_Cofolx will be added to the Coforma space by the Delivery Lead or Scrum Master during onboarding, Ad Hoc members need to be added to the channels by another Ad Hoc member who is already in the channel._
