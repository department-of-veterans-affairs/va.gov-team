## Problem
> *Describe the challenge / pain point you seek to address.:* 

Today, Veterans and other claimants and appellants sometimes struggle to choose the right decision review option for their unique needs for a myriad of reasons that can result in delays and unfavorable decisions. Veterans aren't consistently able to identify the differences between options, their eligibility, and if it will give them the chance at a best outcome.

## Target Audience
The enhanced decision review onramp initiative will focus on Veterans (or their accredited representatives) that seek to file a decision review option for disability compensation on VA.gov. Additionally, the enhanced onramp will key in on users that have first navigated to these pages: "VA decision reviews and appeals", "Choosing a decision review option", or “Find a Form” on VA.gov or have used decision review-related search terms.

Why?
- Limiting scope to appeals for disability compensation claims because it is what the team currently has the most subject matter expertise.
- These VA.gov static gateway pages enable users to navigate to the decision review options and submit an online Supplemental Claim (SC), Higher Level Review (HLR), or Notice of Disagreement (NOD).


## Audience
All Veterans and other claimants/appellants who navigate to the gateway pages, namely those who seek information regarding their decision review options with the VA or seek to submit an online claim.
- Including, but not limited to, Veterans who just want to know of the options for future reference, Veterans who want to understand the options available prior to choosing one, and Veterans who are simply passing through to a specific decision review page.

### Third-party Decision Review sources

Where Veterans are finding information regarding clarification of decision review options:
- Paid Veteran assistance programs
- https://veteranai.co/
- Online search articles (Example )
- Social platforms (Reddit, Facebook)

Considerations:
-Do accredited reps have access to downstream VA systems to show Veterans?

## Desired User Outcomes
- As a Veteran, I will know the exact purpose of each decision review option.
- As a Veteran, I feel VA has supplied enough engaging and understandable content to self-educate about the decision review options.
- As a Veteran, I have confidence in my eligibility for the decision review I choose.
- As a Veteran, I will have an idea of how long each decision review option takes


## Undesired User Outcomes
- As a Veteran, I do not want the decision review options to be harder to choose between
- As a Veteran, I do not want to feel overwhelmed making me not want to proceed with any decision review option
  
## Desired Business Outcomes
- Reduction in Veterans that submit claims and appeals for which they do not qualify for
- Reduction in the number of disability claims that are submitted when a supplemental claim would have been more appropriate
- Reduction in duplicate submissions
- Increase of Veterans that state they're satisfied with their online decision review experience

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Increase of incorrect and duplicate claims
- Negative impact to CSAT

## Risks
- Frustration from users who are seeking to file decision review for claims other than disability compensation (i.e., users who are not in our target audience) 
- Users gain false confidence in their decision review options that result in unfavorable outcomes

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
> 💡 *VA.gov products measure success against Ease of use, Service Completion, Trust/Satisfaction, Health.*<sup>1</sup>\
> 💡 *Identify balancing metrics to ensure you're not bringing about undesired outcomes.*

- % reduction in form abandonment | DOMO and GA
- % reduction in number of pathways started | form in progress count
- % reduction in incorrect claims submitted | how is incorrect determined?
- % reduction in duplicate claims submitted | 
- Increased redirects to form introductions from targeted gateway pages Gateway page views
- CSAT | how to measure (periodic page surveys? Does this already exist?)

- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
  - Examples:
    - Upstream/Downstream API/Data availability and reliability
    - Site performance impacts (see [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse), [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/), #-daily-lighthouse-scan)
  
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - Examples:
