# Supplemental Claims (21-0995) 2024 Updates

## Background
Supplemental Claims (VA 21-0995) was digitized and published in initially in February 2023. Since then, stakeholders have made updates to the paper form, including optional but important new sections, rephrasing of questions, and new fields.
In order for our digital Veteran userbase to successfully submit our form, we must also update our digital form to match the latest paper form updates.

## Problem or Opportunity
The current digital experience of VA 21-0995 doesn't include new questions asked on the updated paper form. The questions include an option to give updates on living situation, and for Veterans with conditions related to Military Sexual Trauma (MST) an option to include a notification in their medical files for their Veteran Health Administration (VHA) providers. There are also new required fields such as selection of Treatment facilities, and the option to not include a date for VA health visits after 2005. 

## Proposed Solution
We want to update our digital experience to include the new sections and questions, while ensuring that it does not hinder the Veteran's ability to fill out and submit the form.

## In of Scope
Update the Supplemental Claims flow to include sections for living situation, MST option, and treatment facility questions.

- Review existing research on these forms and Veteran MST, identifying relevant findings to incorporate in our MVP
- Collaborate with OCTO and VBA stakeholders throughout the design process
- Review content changes with CAIA, including any changes needed to the benefits hub content related to the form change
- Collaborate with LH to ensure that the endpoint includes the newest questions, and populates an updated form
- Review new designs with the Platform team through the Collaboration Cycle
- Implement updates
- Conduct usability testing on the updated form

## Out of Scope

## Success
Online 21-0995 reflects the updated 21-0995 paper form

## Risks

## Release Plan
The new paper form was released around the end of June 2025, but this timeline could change. We want to be updated as soon as possible.
