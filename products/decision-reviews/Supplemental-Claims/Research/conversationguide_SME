# Introduction
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Pam, I am a Senior Designer/Researcher on the VA Benefits Crew. Today we’d like to learn about your experience with the Supplemental Claims benefit form and process. 


# Formalities
* Some of my colleagues may be on the call to observe, but I’ll lead the conversation. We will have some time for open questions at the end. 
* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your feedback accurately. 
* Any questions before we begin?

**Automation Opportunities **
* Do you know of any initiatives where the VA was able to presumptively connect people to a claim? [Blue Water Navy]
    * If yes, what did they do?
    * If yes, are these claims adjudicated in the same way? What is the same or different?
    * Are there obvious opportunities to automate any parts of the SC?
* Can we learn from other benefit automation efforts?
