Moderator: Eileen Chi

Product: 

Observers: Eileen Chi, David Kennedy, Skyler Schain, Julie Strothman

Have link to prototype ready [code prototype](https://staging.va.gov/decision-reviews/test-sc/introduction) 

## Starting the session

• Keep observers in the waiting room to ask the participant if they still consent to having observers in the session. Tell them to have their camera on with full name displayed for a brief introduction to the participant when they are admitted to the session. 

• In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.

• In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked.

• Check your screen sharing setup and share permissions for participants.

• When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro.

## Intro (2 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today. I’m Eileen, and I’m part of a team working on decision review forms on the VA.gov website. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

I have 3 colleagues in the Zoom waiting room–we often include a couple of people to observe and take notes. Are you okay with having them join us for this session?

- If the participant does not consent, ask the observers to kindly leave the Zoom via Slack.
    
- If a participant consents, let other observers into the room and allow a short pause to say hello. Here are some other members from our website team - if you'd all like to say a quick hello, and then mute, that would be great.
    

This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you any longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic to keep us on schedule.

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability; we are testing our work so you cannot do anything wrong here. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. As you go through the exercise, it'll be really helpful if you can think out loud as much as possible.

You'll be interacting with a prototype filled with mock or pretend data. This may not function exactly the way you expect. Since it's a simulation, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. 

Also, I want you to know that I work on the VA.gov website. I don’t have access to your records or benefits, and I don’t have the ability to change your claims or benefits in any way. My main focus is to understand your experience with the website.

Before we get started, I want to ask for your permission to  record my screen and audio as we talk today. We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are deleted after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. Would it be okay for me to record this session?

- If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
    
- We like to use transcription to improve our notes. However, this Zoom setting turns on Closed Captions in Zoom, which can be a problem for screen readers. Would it be disruptive to have Closed Captions on?
    

- If no, turn on transcription.
    

Start recording. Turn on transcription.

I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Do I have your permission to record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Participant Tech Setup (5-15 minutes)

Before we get started, I want to get our tech set up for the prototype review later.

### Screenshare prompt

- So we can understand how you’re navigating this feature, we’d like you to share your screen.
    
- If participants cannot share their screen, walk them through screen sharing.

## Warm up (5 minutes)

### Task goal: Confirm they qualify for the study, learn how they receive information from VA about claims, and how that's meeting their needs.

Before we look at the prototype, I'd like to get a little background information from you:

- How do you currently file claims with VA?.  
    Let's talk about the website - how do you use [VA.gov](http://va.gov)? 
      
- As part of the scheduling for this session, we asked if you had filed a disability claim with VA. Can you tell me how you got info from VA about updates on those claims?
    
- How likely are you to use VA.gov to file a follow-up claim?
   - If not likely, tell me more about that.
    

  

## Determine if the Veteran understands disclosing personal information (5 minutes)
    

### Task goal: Validate that users are able to start the form, review their personal information, and disclose their living situation

Now I'm going to ask you to open a prototype from a link I'll post in the chat and have you share your screen. Just a reminder - it'll be very helpful if you think out loud and share what's on your mind as much as possible as you're looking at the prototype.

  

Scenario:

We will be walking through a scenario where you play the part of Hector, a Veteran who applied for disability compensation for migraines  and was previously denied, but now you have new evidence you think qualifies you. As we go through the prototype, the claim will be filled automatically & applies to “Hector,” not you, but I'd like to hear your thoughts as you try to complete the task.

- We'll be looking at a prototype of [VA.gov](http://va.gov) and talking about specific sections.
    
- Go ahead and start to file a claim and talk aloud as you go. We’d like to understand if anything confuses you (no wrong answers!).
    
- ITF: How would you describe what this alert is telling you?
    
- Homelessness: How would you describe what this is asking you?
    
- What do you think happens if you click yes?
    

  
  

Things to watch for: 

- Do any users understand that the VA has data on file for them and what it is?
    
- Do users understand what homelessness and being at risk of being homeless means?

- Are users comfortable with disclosing this information?
    
- Do users understand that all the questions are optional in this section?

Great, thank you so much. This has been really helpful for our team, and we appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. 
- Do you have any questions or last thoughts about what we did today before we end the session?

## Exit Strategies

- Out of questions: We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.
    
- Blame technology: I am so sorry, but I just learned that the [website/prototype/thing I wanted to test with you today] is unexpectedly not working. I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your time.
    
- Backup Moderator: This is best to practice beforehand, but can work if there is an emergency with the moderator. Appoint another team member who will be on the call as the backup moderator. You can say “for the next part of this session [backup moderator name] will moderate.” They should be prepared to jump in if something happens to you or you are not comfortable to finish the session.
