### **OCTO Priorities**

✅  Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.

✅  Our platforms are the best way to deliver products at VA.

### **Veteran Journey**

Since Veterans can file Supplemental Claims benefits with VA between 180 and 90 days before separating from the military, this work impacts the Veteran journey from serving, to getting out, and all the way to dying as survivors can also file Supplemental Claims on the Veteran’s behalf. This work especially maps to the taking care of myself part of the Veteran journey, as Supplemental Claims for disability compensation supports:

* Recognizing and addressing mental health needs

* Managing primary care and chronic health issues

* Maintaining my health

## **Research Goals**

1. Determine if the Supplemental Claims updates create any new points of friction within the form

   1. Validate if Veterans understand (or skip if ineligible) the series of homelessness questions

   2. Validate that users are able to understand if they’re eligible for and respond to the VHA Military Sexual Trauma (MST) Notifications question

   3. Validate that users are able to understand what it means to submit a piece of non-VA evidence (submitting a 4142/a)

2. Validate that the users are able to complete the new Supplemental Claim flow

3. Validate that AT-users are able to navigate through the entire form

## **Research Questions**

* Do users experience friction within any point of the form?

* Are users able to navigate through the new form flow?

* Do any of the new screens / questions cause any hesitation?

## **Methodology**

We conducted remote usability testing over Zoom using a code prototype with two different cohorts. One cohort was for Veterans who use assistive technology, another cohort was for Veterans who’ve received a denial on their claim

[Link to prototype](https://staging.va.gov/decision-reviews/test-sc/introduction)

## **Hypotheses and Conclusions**

* We believe that all users will still be able to successfully complete a Supplemental Claim. Mostly True.

  * True for most Veterans. All of our Veterans were able to complete the Supplemental Claim form flow, and reached the confirmation page within the prototype. We witnessed two JAWS users having issues with specific form fields (checkboxes and radios).

  * The new questions did not interfere with the Veterans’ ability to complete the form.

  * Veterans using assistive technology rated 10s, 8.5, and 7.5 for confidence in submitting the form. Sighted Veterans rated an average of 9 (3 10s and 3 8s)

* We believe Veterans will disclose the information that is most relevant to them. Likely True.

  * Veterans disclosed information regarding their condition if they thought it would help with their claim. Veterans are comfortable with skipping over questions they thought were not relevant to them.

* We believe Veterans will be able to provide the relevant information that could lead to a more favorable outcome by submitting through this digital experience. Maybe True.

  * Veterans understood they were able to submit evidence through the Supplemental Claim, and had no issues navigating through the various types of evidence retrieval. A few Veterans realized while submitting that there are other types of evidence they hadn't considered, such as lay/witness statements.

  * A few Veterans would still choose to rely on a representative (whether VSO or accredited representative) because although the form is clear, they would want a professional to help them navigate the appeals process in general.

  * A Veteran mentioned VSOs work for the VA, and not for the benefit of Veterans, so they would prefer working with an accredited representative

## **Key Findings**

1. JAWS users had a hard time operating form controls since there were issues such as checkboxes and radios not being announced.

2. 3 out of 4 Veterans with a claim related to MST did not understand the purpose of the MST notification, and either chose to decline or revoke their previous decision.

3. Veterans without MST were able to understand the initial question, but a few were concerned about the emphasis we’re placing on MST and PACT over other conditions.

4. Half of the participants experienced friction with the notice of evidence needed.

5. A few Veterans were not familiar with the names of certain facility types.

6. Most Veterans missed or didn’t choose to act on the hint about treatment dates.

7. All of the Veterans understood what submitting non-VA medical records means submitting an authorization, but a few struggled with the process.

8. Most of the participants struggled with going back and adding evidence from either the evidence summary, or review and submit page.

## **Details of Findings**

### **Finding 1**

JAWS users had a hard time operating form controls since there were issues such as checkboxes and radios not being announced.

2 JAWS users had trouble navigating certain areas of our prototype due to issues with checkboxes and radios.

* JAWS didn’t announce that the radio/checkbox fields were editable.  
* One JAWS user made a selection, only for it to be changed because it dragged the selection to the next option as he was navigating.  
* Both were eventually able to find workarounds, but voiced frustration.

### **Finding 2**

3 out of 4 Veterans with a claim related to MST did not understand the purpose of the MST notification, and either chose to decline or revoke their previous decision.

* Two participants mentioned the question felt sudden and out-of-place, and were concerned that it would affect their claim.

> “Here's the problem. VA has showed us that they're not taking care of their veterans. So I maybe it's just for me. I have a problem with fully trusting Va. So I'm not going to believe it… This is probably not the best place to put it. However, if something to the effect of to provide better healthcare services. We're looking to inquire if if you've experienced this, and VA. Is truly trying to help better the healthcare services that we could get for that.” P11

* One mentioned that they’ve provided details about MST, but haven’t seen any changes to their claim. 

> “To me this seems convoluted. I don't understand why that would be a thing. In my experience, I've let my provider know. But there's not been any more actionable things that she has done towards that experience.” P11

* Another mentioned that they’re afraid that noting that they had MST would cause delays to their claim.

> “It just seems like it's gonna it's  an indicator to slow things down. Because, just like okay, or you know, if it's handled by a special group or whatever it's an indicator, it's gonna add that indicator” P13

* Two weren’t sure why the notifications question was being asked again when they already gave an answer within the initial claim.

> “I don't know, because, even though I submitted and it was approved like there's no rating. But the only services I've noticed, for it was like group meetings and therapy, and that's it. So if I had to do it again I probably wouldn’t do it because it wasn’t much benefit from it except for therapy and then those support groups can be a little stressful. So they weren’t that helpful.” P3

### **Finding 3**

Veterans without MST were able to understand the initial question, but a few were concerned about the emphasis we’re placing on MST and PACT over other conditions.

* We added an interstitial screen to help Veterans determine if they need to answer a question for an option only available to Veterans who have a claim related to MST, and all of the Veterans understood the question. On the contrary, when a Veteran without MST chose to read the question, they chose "No" instead of "Not eligible"

> “Here we go with MST. They gonna make somebody have. I mean, I mean, it's like, it's so imposing. It's unnecessary. I'm gonna leave it at that.” P2

### **Finding 4**

Half of the participants experienced friction with the notice of evidence needed.

* Three Veterans using assistive technology experienced friction with the presumptive conditions alert, since it wasn’t announced as an alert, but the close button was announced.

> “Presumptive, and I would spell that out a little bit. There. Not everybody's gonna know what presumptive means.” P4

* One struggled with the language in the alert stating that they can submit “this form” within the PACT alert, but didn’t realize it was referring to the 0995\.

> “If you have a presumptive condition for a condition we now consider, presume you can submit this form for review. But where's the form?” P14

* One clicked through the link for the notice of evidence needed, found the links to other forms helpful, but couldn’t find their way back to the form from the new tab.

> “No, I probably would have gone back to the start and done the whole thing over. But here it is. I see it. Yeah, there it is. Okay. Well, that's that makes me feel dumb.” P10

* One mentioned that the Supplemental Claim is being submitted within the year, so they shouldn’t have to verify that they’ve read the notice.

> “Okay, obviously, the I certify that I've reviewed the notice of evidence. This is, it's not matching. Because the 1st one is saying, if you're filing claim. More than one year after you got your decision, you need to review the notice of evidence needed. However, underneath it's requiring you to review the notice of evidence needed.” P11

### **Finding 5**

4 out of 11 Veterans were not familiar with the names of certain facility types.

* Veterans were unclear what a Vet Center or Department of Defense military treatment facility (MTF) is.  
* Veterans would choose Vet Center until they see Vet Healthcare Center, and realize they’re two different types of locations.

> “What is a VA Vet Center?” P6
> “Department of Defense military treatment facility. I’m not sure what that is. That a base you would go to, and a medical clinic on a base? I’m not sure what that is.” P10  
> “I think the thing that I learned early when I was applying for it back in the early 2000s was that there was no connection between the Department of Defense and the VA.” P8

### **Finding 6**

Most Veterans missed or didn’t choose to act on the new hint about treatment dates.

* A Veteran expressed frustration that medical treatment dates are still being asked

* Veterans with dates on the top of their minds filled out the treatment dates

> “I think this is silly. Because what I’ve been told is that they pull your whole file from the facility, and they look like they'll dig for everything, so honestly for me, if I’m telling you the facility, and it’s a VA facility you should be able to get it. I shouldn’t have to give you a date.” P11

* “Which is interesting, that we have to do that, since it’s all VA” P14

### **Finding 7**

All of the Veterans understood what submitting non-VA medical records means submitting an authorization, but a few struggled with the process.

* Some weren’t sure why a 4142 would be required again for the Supplemental Claim, since they had already given authorization in their disability claim. They struggled with the way VA and non-VA evidence was listed separately, when she should just be giving a list of new facilities.

> “It sounded like you shouldn't file that form but then you should file the form so it just kind of was a little hang up there that it kind of had some doubt with.” P7

> “I'm just saying, Okay, it's like, Oh, I've got a new 4142\. I printed it, saved it as a file, uploaded it, and now I'm doing the same thing again. Here.” P13

### **Finding 8**

Most of the participants struggled with going back and adding evidence from either the evidence summary, or review and submit page.

Out of 11 participants, 8 tested a flow where they made edits to evidence when they got to the review page, and 5 struggled with making edits. The different ways participants struggled with making edits include:

* Not realizing that they’ll be dropped to the beginning of the evidence flow and seeing all of the evidence they’ve already added

* Making a change by mistake to their previously added evidence

* Not being able to go directly back to the evidence summary after making an edit

### **Additional Insights**

1. Most of the participants did not understand what the ITF informational alert was for, but chose to move forward.

2. Veterans have a hard time trusting a process when they receive inconsistent and inaccurate information.

   * Veterans expected the Community Care center data to be already a part of the VA system since information is uploaded weekly

     > “I said, hey? Can you send this to the VA right away? You know they need it by this date, you know, this letter's been sitting there, and they said, well, we upload to the VA every week.” P13

   * A Veteran received a notice that they had to give authorization despite uploading their own records

     > “I have to authorize. I also tried to send them my version that I downloaded. That wasn't acceptable, and until I had to reach out to the provider who already is providing this to the VA. Now they want more, you know. Now they want a summation or something. I don't know.” 13

   * Veterans spend a long time asking for records to be retrieved, only to be given the wrong records.

     > “Those DoD records were, you know, you had to get them separately. I once took 3 years to get my records, and when I opened up the disk it was somebody else's records with my name on it. So I had to do another 3 years” P8

3. Veterans responded positively to the multiple summary pages, and areas where they can make edits

   > “But I do like how, throughout, by the time you get to this, this page, this page right here your stuff should be on the money, because it gives you so many options so many times to edit.” P2

4. The digital upload process is still a source of friction for digital submissions.

   > “I had to learn all this the hard way” P8

   > “I had to pay someone to digitize my documents” P7

   > “I get the size, but I don’t get the width and the height” P13

5. Veterans that went through the non-VA medical records flow felt inclined to give an answer to the limiting consent page when it was not required.

   * P8 caught that he was limiting information and removed it from the evidence summary screen

   * P10 put “no” in the limiting consent box, and did not realize that it was labeled as “added a limitation”

## **Recommendations**

1. Determine if usability issues with JAWS is replicable and pervasive across forms.

2. Keep the initial MST question and add language to clarify that the question is optional and does not impact the Veteran’s claim.

3. Possibly remove the presumptive conditions alert. It’s clear to Veterans in the form that it covers PACT Act, and the alert was causing unnecessary friction.

4. Adjust the wording around types of facilities to clarify the meaning.

5. Adjust the visual design around the memorable date hint.

6. Revisit the list-and-loop pattern to create a clearer editing flow.

   1. Adjust the add new evidence link to clarify that it will also bring them back in the flow, which edits their information

## **Next Steps**

Make updates based on recommendations, and consider a better evidence collection flow.

## **Who we talked to**

We talked to two cohorts of research participants. 1 cohort of 5 Veterans using assitive technology. 1 cohort of 6 Veterans not using assitive technology.
