# Research Plan for Supplemental Claims
## OCTO Objectives
## North Stars
- Increase the usage and throughput of VA services
- Decrease the time Veterans spend waiting for an outcome
- Increase the throughput of favorable supplemental claims
## Specific Goal	
Veterans and their families can claim disability benefits faster and more accurately, leading to more favorable outcomes. 
## Veteran Journey
Services and products coming out of this effort would support Taking Care of Myself, specifically managing primary care and chronic health issues in the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf).

## Research Goals
The goal of this discovery is to 
- Understand Veteran needs around applying for disability compensation through a Supplemental Claim (SC)
- Identify opportunities to optimize the actions and decisions that lead to favorable claims outcomes for a subset of the Veteran population related to the Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2021 ([PACT Act](https://enchanting-fossa-083.notion.site/PACT-Act-Overview-for-Presumptive-Claims-RRD-b8da586e2b1f4ff38a76c672a0b37a68#94f8b7c860324764890ecc6b5d3fd01f)).

## Background
Veterans file Supplemental Claims when their claim for disability compensation is denied and new and relevant evidence is needed. The Supplemental Claim Decision Review type is the most widely used DR. Currently there is no way to digitally submit a Supplemental Claim apart from uploading a PDF.  The Lighthouse API team has done work to support building a Veteran facing experience to file a Supplemental Claim.  

The findings from this effort will produce prioritized recommendations for modernizing the Supplemental Claims application with potential optimizations for Veterans that fall under the PACT Act.


[PACT Act Legislation](https://enchanting-fossa-083.notion.site/PACT-Act-Overview-for-Presumptive-Claims-RRD-b8da586e2b1f4ff38a76c672a0b37a68#94f8b7c860324764890ecc6b5d3fd01f): _VBA predicts the PACT Act legislation will result in up to ~7.5 million additional supplemental claims being submitted in the next ten years. The anticipated volume of presumptive claims being added to the existing claims processing backlog is a major concern for VBA._


## Hypothesis

Veterans will benefit by having a clear pathway to file a supplemental claim on VA.gov, helping them achieve the goal of being compensated for their disability incurred while serving within a reasonable amount of time. 

## Goals 
* Personalize the experience for Veterans appealing via Supplemental Claims
* Improve speed and usability of SCs
* Reduce cognitive burden involved in appealing claims decisions
* Reduce factors that contribute to unfavorable decisions

## Research Questions

**Phase 1: SMEs and Collaborative Teams**
* What are the biggest challenges for Decision Reviews?
* What is considered new and relevant evidence?
* Can we learn from any efforts where the VA was able to presumptively connect Veterans to a claim? [ i.e. Blue Water Navy ]
* Can we learn from other benefit automation efforts?
* How does this work relate to the personalization initiative?

**Phase 2: Form audit, technical discovery and research gap assessment**
* What are the biggest challenges Veterans face when filing supplemental claims?
* What are the biggest challenges adjudicators face in approving claims?
* What is considered new and relevant evidence?
* Where are the opportunities to pre-fill, automate or presumptively connect Veteran claims?
* How does communication with the Veteran typically happen during supplemental claims processing?

## Methods

**Phase 1:** Remote subject-matter experts (SME), collaborative team members  and review of past research conducted with administrative staff at the VA involved with intaking, processing and deciding Supplemental Claims.   
[Conversation Guide SME](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/decision-reviews/Supplemental-Claims/Research/conversationguide_SME.md)

Methods also include:
* Stakeholder interviews
* Collaborative benefit team syncs 
* Design and content system process discovery 
* Past research review


**Phase 2:** Past research review and form audit exercise with internal teams to understand pain points around the processing and filing Supplemental Claims. We will also identify gaps and opportunities for research with Veterans.  
Methods also include:
* Technical Discovery
* [Form audit and journey mapping ](https://app.mural.co/t/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/m/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/1653490344368/8a035f7639e54b70edb4dc7002cae95967c36d1a?sender=uf4e8628bdc7dc81e50353314)


## Participants 

**PHASE 1: Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and Collaborative Team Members**

Stakeholders 
* Matt Self
* Shawna Hein
* Paul Shute
* TBD

Collaborative Teams
* Lighthouse Benefits Crew (ongoing)
* Benefits Automation Crew (ongoing)
* Contact Center
* Content/IA Team (ongoing)

**PHASE 2: Processing and Filing Claims**  
* Internal teams technical discovery
* Adjudicator and representative research review and form audit exercise
* Gap analysis to define further research

## Schedule

**Phase 1: June 1-15**

Outcomes: 
* We identify borrowed learnings about Veteran pain points.
* We define what can be reused from existing infrastructure and components.

**Phase 2: June 15-28**

Outcomes:
* We identify unique learnings about Veteran pain points.
* We define hypotheses about value that we want to validate.
* We define assumption tests to execute.
