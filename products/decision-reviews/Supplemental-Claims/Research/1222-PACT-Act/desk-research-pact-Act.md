# Supplemental Claims PACT Act Desk Research

# Research Goals
Gather information on what veterans are saying about PACT ACT and gauge their level of understanding. We want to see what we can leverage to include in our design work. We also want to look at some existing research done to see what we can learn. 
Lastly, we want to use the knowledge gained to frame future veterans research studies. 

## Summary of Finding
As of December 2022, veterans appear to be familiar with PACT ACT and have a general understanding of what it entails. There has been some confusion surrounding the exact time the PACT ACT claims will be rated. Some claimed the ratings had already begun in 2022 and they seem to have proof, and others are confident ratings will not begin until January 2023. Furthermore, there are some VET (veterans) that have received low ratings from their initial presumptive claim, they are considering filing a supplemental PACT claim, however they are afraid this may negatively impact an existing rating. These VETs want to file a PACT claim with the hopes of getting a higher disability rating, but are afraid of the risk of harming their current rating. Lastly, there are VETs and dependents who were living in war zones (ie. Guam, Vietnam, Gulf War, post 9/11 etc) who are NOT experiencing any symptoms but had toxic exposures that are wondering if they should have doctor checkups or be placed on a registry; dependents who lived in these war zones are wondering if they are covered under PACT ACT as well.

## Details of findings
### Finding 1: VET is having concerns about how his newly diagnosed illness might affect an existing claim.
Found a  [reddit post where a VET received a 50% rating](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransAffairs/comments/zouq60/non_service_connected_cancer/)  due to a bone injury during service. He was recently diagnosed with lung cancer (30 yr smoker) that has affected the same bone that was in his original claim. There is discussion on whether or not this will upgrade his rating and/or will presumptive evidence will play a role.
_My thoughts_: I’m wondering if this could be an opportunity to educate VETs on options for clearly discern if their case falls under presumptive claim or  [A&A (Aid and Attendance allowance)](https://www.va.gov/pension/aid-attendance-housebound/) , etc

### Finding 2: VET is seeking clarification on when PACT reviews will happen.
Based on  [latter comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransBenefits/comments/zegyyb/pact_clarification/) , it seems that the VET understands something about PACT and presumptive claims, because he is confident there’s, “no way his claim could be service connected without being presumptive under PACT…”

Another Veteran is seeking clarification on  [when PACT ACT claims will have decision](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransBenefits/comments/zd5hzg/pact_act_question/) , is it by Dec ‘22 or does he have to wait to Jan ‘23

### Finding 3: Seemingly healthy VET is unsure if he should take precautionary measures to begin screenings since he had frequent exposures to burn pits during his time of service.
This VET  [doesn’t keep up with his health](https://www.reddit.com/r/Veterans/comments/wf7avj/the_pact_act_and_your_va_benefits/) , at the time of his post, he hasn’t felt sick but he revealed during his time in service he was the “boot” so he was often picked to work the burn pit. He’s wondering if he should begin screenings. Another VET advised him to screen and at least put himself on a burn pit registry.

### Finding 4: There’s been some discrepancies surrounding the 10 year presumptive period.
The confusion is whether or not a diagnosis has to be given within the 10 year period or if the illness must manifest itself within the 10 years of the vet being discharged. A screenshot was taken of a VET referencing two codes of regulations 8 CFR 3.303 and  [3.307 (c)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-38/chapter-I/part-3/subpart-A/subject-group-ECFR39056aee4e9ff13/section-3.307)

### Finding 5: Dependents who were living in a war zone and had been exposed to Agent Orange, wondered if they would be able to benefit from PACT ACT.
 A user posted a concern about the inclusion of dependents who were living in a war zone ( [Guam during Vietnam](https://www.reddit.com/r/Veterans/comments/zel8rj/do_you_have_pact_act_questions/) ) and were exposed to Agent orange. They are wondering if they would be included in the PACT. A direct quote from the post is pasted below:
“For dependents who lived on Guam during Vietnam, and were exposed to Agent Orange, have they updated the PACT Act to include them? Their dependents? Has anyone heard anything about that?

# Additional insights
A few surprising posts were seen where people have evidence that PACT ACT ratings were made as early as 3rd quarter in 2022. Also, there’s been some suspicion about malicious acts by the rater to delay benefits for a particular VET he has been having issues with. In the thread, other VETs had experiences where they felt as though they were being treated unfairly.

1. Though there was a wide understanding that PACT Act reviews would not be processed until the start of 2023, a VET  [received a letter with an upgraded rating back in August 2022 ](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransBenefits/comments/x489xv/i_was_finally_approved_for_my_claim_at_100_due_to/) citing the upgrade was because of the new PACT ACT.

2. This VET believes his rating has been  [upgraded to 100% back in Sept 2022 due to PACT ACT](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransBenefits/comments/x489xv/i_was_finally_approved_for_my_claim_at_100_due_to/)  going into law. However, most posts in reddit says ratings will not occur until jan 2023

3. In the comments responding to this thread, a  [VET believes his non-PACT related injuries are being submitted as PACT claims](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransBenefits/comments/z2ssk7/comment/iy6y41s/) . He believes this could be a malicious act from the rater. He has had his challenges with a particular rater, and the VET believes the rater passed his claims as PACT so it can be further delayed.
