# PACT Act Research Strategy

Benefits Team 1

Dec 2022

## Overview
Starting in January 2023, Veterans filing claims for presumptive conditions that are PACT Act eligible are allowed to file without submitting new and relevant evidence. To get a disability rating, Veterans must prove that their time in service caused their condition. For claims that fall under the PACT Act, we remove the burden of proof. Veterans with presumptive conditions can file a Supplemental Claim without providing evidence.

## Goals
Understand how to identify PACT Act eligible claims.
Identify opportunities to improve the experience for those applying to Supplemental Claims under the PACT Act.

## Metrics
### KPIs
- Time to establish a PACT Act supplemental claim
- Discuss with VBA and PO

## Tasks
- [ ] Research: How are we identifying claims that qualify for PACT Act?
- [ ] Research: What do the veterans expect the application experience to be like if they qualify for the PACT Act?

## Open questions
- Is there a timing / prioritization that we need to be aware of? 
  - Do those who qualify for PACT act need to be flagged for earlier consideration?
  - Will the PACT act pathway need to be in place during the launch of Supplemental Claims?
- How is policy handling the evidence requirement for Supplemental Claims?
  - Currently lighthouse has an evidence requirement for submissions. How stakeholders want to handle it long-term. (might not be something for SME, more for implementation)
- How are they currently identifying cases that contain presumptive conditions?
  - What other qualifiers do we need to consider (discharge date, service connection date, etc)?
  - Are they allowing veterans to self-identify, or is it something that they have to make the connection during reviews?
  - How are we handling veterans who have presumptive conditions that do not fall within the timeline of the PACT act?
  - What is the data we’re using to identify veterans who fall under the PACT act?
- What are the policy requirements for terminal illness flash?
