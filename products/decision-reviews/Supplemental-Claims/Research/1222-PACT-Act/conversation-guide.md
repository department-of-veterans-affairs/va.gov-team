### Conversation Guide for Benefits Team 1 - Supplemental Claims, January 2023 
1. Have link to prototype ready  [mobile](https://www.sketch.com/s/d2416db4-9a4f-4919-abe4-20ba4bdcfd89/prototype/a/A4ED99CB-748B-4EED-8F83-5D6733BA9F42)

### Starting the session
• _Keep observers in the waiting room to ask the participant if they still consent to having observers in the session. Tell them to have their camera on with full name displayed for a brief introduction to the participant when they are admitted to the session._ 

• _In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute._ 

• _In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked._ 

• _Check your screen sharing setup and share permissions for participants._  

• _When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro._

### Intro: 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today. I’m Eileen Chi, I’m part of a team working on the process of claiming benefits on VA.gov.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

I have some colleagues in the waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I wanted to confirm before we get going. Are you okay with letting them in for this session?
- If the participant does not consent, ask the observers to kindly leave the Zoom via Slack.
- If a participant consents, let other observers into the room and allow a short pause to say hello. Here are some other members from our website team - if you'd all like to say a quick hello. And now for those of you who just joined, if you could please turn off your cameras to save bandwidth, that would be great.

This entire session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you any longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic to keep us on schedule.

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability; we are testing our work so you cannot do anything wrong here. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. As you go through the exercise, it'll be really helpful if you can think out loud as much as possible.

You'll be interacting with a mobile prototype. This may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be interactive, and some will not. Since it's a simulation, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. We will be walking through a scenario where you play the part of a Veteran whose disability claim was denied, but now have been informed about a piece of legislation you think covers your claim.

If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are deleted after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
- If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

_Start recording._

I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

### Warm up
_Goal: Confirm they qualify for the study, learn how they receive information from VA about claims, and how that's meeting their needs._

Before we look at the prototype, I'd like to get a little background information from you:
- First, tell me a little about yourself and your relationship to the VA.
- As part of the scheduling for this session, we asked if you had filed a disability claim with VA. Can you tell me how you got info from VA about updates on those claims?
- How do you typically manage your VA claims?
- Let's talk about the website - how do you use VA.gov?
  - If they use it: Do you ever check your claim status when you are logged in?
- How likely are you to use VA.gov to file a follow-up claim?
  - If not likely, tell me more about that.
- What do you know about the PACT Act?

### Task 1. Supplemental Claims Introduction
_Goal: Validate that users are clear where they are and the expectations of the form._

Now I'm going to ask you to open a prototype from a link I'll post in the chat and have you share your screen. Just a reminder - it'll be very helpful if you think out loud and share what's on your mind as much as possible as you're looking at the prototype.

* Send link to prototype in Zoom chat
* If user is on mobile, tell them to tap the three dots that say "More" and then select Chat from the menu to access the link that was sent
* Ask participant to share their screen by selecting the green Share Screen button in the middle of the bottom menu

**Scenario:** You will be in a fictional scenario. Imagine you found that your disability claim was denied, and reached this page because you wanted to learn more about how you can file a Supplemental Claim.

- From this page, do you know why you would be filing a Supplemental Claim vs other claims?
- Is it clear what a presumptive condition is?
- What do you think that link leads to?
- Is it clear what you can do next?

**Scenario:**  OK now I have a shift in the scenario. You find out that asthma, the condition you’ve been denied for, is now covered under PACT. How will you go about filing the claim? 

- Go ahead and start to file a claim, and talk aloud as you go.

#### Things to watch for:
* Do any participants understand the new requirements for Supplemental Claim?
* Do any participants know how to access more information or help if they don't understand something on the page?

### Task 3. Review veteran information and issues for review
_Goal: Validate that the details displayed are the most important pieces of information for disability issues_

As a reminder, for this fictional scenario, the content will be filled in for you and not apply directly to you. 
* Please verify your primary information.
 * Choose a primary phone number

Ok, great, let’s move on. Can you describe to me what you think this section is for?

### Post-task questions:
- On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being the least confident and 10 being the most confident, how do you feel submitting this claim? Why?
- On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being the worst and 10 being the best, how would you rate this experience? Why?
 - Optional: If you were to give this a letter grade, A-F, what would you give this experience?

### Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes 
Great, thank you so much. This has been really helpful for our team, and we appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Do you have any questions or last thoughts for me before we end the session?

### Emergency Exit
**Out of questions:** We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.

**Blame technology:** I am so sorry, but I just learned that the prototype is unexpectedly not working. I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your time.

**Backup Moderator:** This is best to practice beforehand, but can work if there is an emergency with the moderator. Appoint another team member who will be on the call as the backup moderator. You can say “for the next part of this session [backup moderator name] will moderate.” They should be prepared to jump in if something happens to you or you are not comfortable to finish the session.
