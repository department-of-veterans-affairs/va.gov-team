### Conversation Guide for Benefits Team 1 - Supplemental Claims, January 2023 
1. Have link to prototype ready  [mobile](https://www.figma.com/proto/JveclTFbNNSmx4eiYwbZdZ/Supplemental-Claims?node-id=70%3A5676&scaling=contain&page-id=10%3A1697&starting-point-node-id=70%3A5676) 
### Starting the session
• _Keep observers in the waiting room to ask the participant if they still consent to having observers in the session. Tell them to have their camera on with full name displayed for a brief introduction to the participant when they are admitted to the session._ • _In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute._ 

• _In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked._ 

• _Check your screen sharing setup and share permissions for participants._  

• _When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro._

### Intro: 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today. I’m Eileen Chi, I’m part of a team working on the process of claiming benefits on VA.gov. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

I have some colleagues in the waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I wanted to confirm before we get going. Are you okay with letting them in for this session?

* If participant does not consent, ask the observers to kindly leave the Zoom via Slack. 

* If participant consents, let other observers into the room and allow a short pause to say hello. Here are some other members from our website team - if you'd all like to say a quick hello. And now for those of you who just joined, if you could please turn off your cameras to save bandwidth, that would be great.

This entire session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you any longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic to keep us on schedule.

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability; we are testing our work so you cannot do anything wrong here. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. As you go through the exercise, it'll be really helpful if you can think out loud as much as possible.

You'll be interacting with a prototype. This may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be interactive, and some will not. Since it's a simulation, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. We will be walking through a scenario where you play the part of a Veteran applying for disability compensation for conditions where you were previously denied, but now have been informed about a piece of legislation you think qualifies you. 

If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 

If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

 _Start recording._

I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?


### Warm up 
_Goal: Confirm they qualify for the study, learn how they receive information from VA about claims, and how that's meeting their needs._

Before we look at the prototype, I'd like to get a little background information from you:

* First, tell me a little about yourself and your relationship to the VA.
* As part of the scheduling for this session, we asked if you had filed a disability claim with VA. Can you tell me how you got info from VA about updates on those claims?
* How do you typically manage your VA claims? 
* Let's talk about the website - how do you use VA.gov? 
    * _If they use it:_ Do you ever check your claim status when you are logged in?
* How likely are you to use VA.gov to file a follow-up claim? 
    * If not likely, tell me more about that.
* What do you know about the PACT Act?

### Task 1. Supplemental Claims Introduction
_Goal: Validate that users are clear where they are and the expectations of the form._

Now I'm going to ask you to open a prototype from a link I'll post in the chat and have you share your screen. Just a reminder - it'll be very helpful if you think out loud and share what's on your mind as much as possible as you're looking at the prototype.

* Send link to prototype in Zoom chat
* If user is on mobile, tell them to tap the three dots that say "More" and then select Chat from the menu to access the link that was sent
* Ask participant to share their screen by selecting the green Share Screen button in the middle of the bottom menu

**Scenario:**
You will be in a fictional scenario. Imagine you are a Veteran needing to file a supplemental claim to a disability claim that was denied. The content will be filled in for you and not apply directly to you, but I'd like to hear your thoughts as you try to complete the task.

* We'll be talking about specific actions in the prototype. 
* * So looking at just what you can see now without scrolling, what's jumping out to you?
* Is it clear what you need to do next?
* Why do you think you need to make this decision?
* What would you do next after making a choice?
* What would you do if you wanted more information about this decision?
* For this study, we’ll focus on disability compensation. Please choose that option.
* Can you describe what’s happening on this screen?
* Go ahead and start to file a claim and talk aloud as you go.
* Please verify your primary information. 
    * Why do you think the VA needs this?

**Things to watch for:**
* Do any users understand the new requirements for Supplemental Claim?

* Do any users struggle with locating the start claim CTA?

### Task 2. Veteran Information and Issues for review
_Goal: Validate that the details displayed are the most important pieces of information for disability issues_

Ok, great, let’s move on. Can you describe to me what you think this section is for? 

* Imagine you are filing a Supplemental Claim for asthma. Please try to do that and talk aloud so we can hear your thought process. (probe as necessary)

**Things to watch for:**
* Do users understand the issues presented to them?
* Does the form contain everything users need to know to confidently continue?

* What do users expect to happen next, when they select continue?

### Task 3. Review and acknowledge this notice of evidence needed
_Goal: Veterans understand and certify that they have read and understand the duty to assist and take action on it_

  * In your own words, what do you think the alert is telling you?

  * What would you expect to happen if you choose “I certify?” 
  * If not?

**Things to watch for:**
* Do users understand the step of the form they are in?

### Task 4b. New and relevant evidence: Evidence summary
_Goal. Veterans understand where they are in the form and summarize the decisions they’ve made_

* Can you describe to me, in your own words, what this page is telling you?
* What would you do if you wanted to add more evidence? 
* Is there anything you expect to see here that you don't? Is anything confusing?
* What would you expect to happen next?

### Task 5. Review and submit
_Goal: Review the claim information that you’ve entered, understand how to change items_

    * How would you expect to edit?
    * Delete?
    * Start over?
* What do you think happens next?

### Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes 
Great, thank you so much. This has been really helpful for our team, and we appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Do you have any questions or last thoughts for me before we end the session?

### Emergency Exit
**Out of questions:** We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.

**Blame technology:** I am so sorry, but I just learned that the prototype is unexpectedly not working. I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your time.

**Backup Moderator:** This is best to practice beforehand, but can work if there is an emergency with the moderator. Appoint another team member who will be on the call as the backup moderator. You can say “for the next part of this session [backup moderator name] will moderate.” They should be prepared to jump in if something happens to you or you are not comfortable to finish the session.
