# Research Plan for Benefits Decision Reviews, Supplemental Claims, PACT, 01/23

## Background
Starting in January 2023, Veterans filing claims for presumptive conditions that are PACT Act eligible are allowed to file a Supplemental Claim without including new evidence. To get a disability rating, Veterans must prove that their time in service caused their condition. For claims that fall under the PACT Act, we remove the burden of proof. Veterans with presumptive conditions can file a Supplemental Claim without providing evidence.

### OCTO Objectives 
- [ ] Increase the usage and throughput of VA services
- [ ] Decrease the time Veterans spend waiting for an outcome
- [ ] Increase the quality and reliability of VA services

### Veteran Journey
Since Veterans can file Supplemental Claims benefits with VA between 180 and 90 days before separating from the military, this work impacts the Veteran journey from ***serving***, to ***getting out***, and all the way to ***dying*** as survivors can also file Supplemental Claims on the Veteranâ€™s behalf. This work especially maps to the ***taking care of myself*** part of the Veteran journey, as Supplemental Claims for disability compensation supports:

- Recognizing and addressing mental health needs
- Managing primary care and chronic health issues
- Maintaining my health

## Research Goals	
****1. Determine if the process of filing a PACT-eligible Supplemental Claim is clear and actionable.****

****2. Determine if the user can understand what presumptive conditions are, and what happens when they submit a claim without evidence.****

****3. Validate that users can successfully and confidently submit a claim with or without adding evidence.****

### Outcome
We'll use the findings from this research to iterate on anything critical that impedes the user from completing the form, add notable enhancements and concerns for the backlog, and refine our MVP.

### Research questions
- Do Veterans understand if this is the right form for them?
- Do Veterans understand the requirements for submitting a Supplemental Claim?
- Do Veterans feel confident enough when submitting a form they think is a PACT-eligible claim?

### Hypothesis
* We believe that all Veterans will be able to confidently complete a Supplemental Claim.
* We believe Veterans will understand the decisions they need to make with the content presented to them.
* We believe Veterans are more likely to achieve a favorable outcome by submitting a Supplemental Claim via this digital experience.

## Method
Usability testing with a mobile prototype that can be viewed on a mobile device or a browser

### Location
We'll conduct remote usability testing over Zoom using a prototype. This method will enable us to observe participants attempting to file a claim with clear objectives given to them. We will plan to test in production with a screen reader user before launch since that is a limitation of testing with a prototype.

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach
Our intended audience for this research is Veterans who have had their claims denied, and intend to file a Supplemental Claim or are in the process of going through a Supplemental Claim.

**Identity Assurance Levels**

- **IAL1:** Attributes, if any, are self-asserted or should be treated as self-asserted; there is no proofing process. (***Ex., User generated user name and pw***)

- **IAL2:** Either remote or in-person identity proofing is required using, at a minimum, the procedures given in NIST SP 800-63A. (***Ex., Id.me or Login.gov account***)

- **IAL3:** In-person or supervised-remote identity proofing is required. Identifying attributes must be verified through examination of physical documentation as described in NIST SP 800-63A.

### Screener
- Can you share your screen on your device? [Must answer yes]
- Have you been denied a claim for disability in the last couple of years? [Must answer yes]

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 

* Pilot participant email: TBD
* Observer: TBD
* Date and time of pilot session: TBD

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research:

### Length of sessions
* Session length: 60 minutes
* Buffer time between sessions: 60 minutes
* Maximum number of sessions per day: 4

### Availability
Monday 8-6

Tuesday 8-6

Wednesday 8-6

Thursday 8-6

Friday 8-6
