Benefits Crew 1 Research Team:
* Pamela Hastings, Design and Research
* Sade Ragsdale, Product

# Introduction

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Pam, I am a Senior Researcher on the VA Benefits Crew. Today we’d like to learn about your experience helping Veterans and their caregivers file Supplemental Claims so we can understand the process and pain points.

I might also ask some questions that may not apply to your role or your expertise. If that’s the case, just let me know and we’ll move on. 


# Formalities 
* Some of my colleagues may be on the call to observe, but I’ll lead the conversation. 
* We will have some time for open questions at the end. 
* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your feedback accurately. 
* Any questions before we begin?
