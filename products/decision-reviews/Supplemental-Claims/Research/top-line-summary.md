# Top Level Summary

### Background

Since the VA modernized its appeals process via the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) in 2017, Claimants who disagree with a VA decision dated on or after February 19, 2019 have had 3 decision review options: [Higher-Level Review](https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/higher-level-review/), [Board Appeal](https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/board-appeal/), and Supplemental Claims.

Supplemental claims allow Claimants to identify or submit new and relevant evidence to the VA so that a reviewer can make a determination whether the new evidence changes the decision. Supplemental claims can be used to:



* Supplement a claim within 1 year - Use this to add supplemental evidence to a claim decision within 1 year of its effective date.
* Re-open a prior claim closed 1+ years ago - Use this to re-open a prior decision that denied service connection, so that you can continue to prosecute the claim. This action will not re-open the prior effective date.
* Continuously prosecute a claim - Use this to continue prosecuting a claim and keep your effective date rolling.

Of the three decision review pathways, supplemental claims are the most widely used. More than 32,000 supplemental claims are filed each month (more than double then number of board appeals and higher-level reviews, combined) which indicates that streamlining and enhancing this pathway has an outsized potential to impact the lives of Veterans and their families.

### What We Did
* SME interviews
* Collaborative Teams Interviews
* Past research review and annotation
* Form gap assessment
* Form field audit
* Content Outline

### Key Findings
1. **Veterans need better, more transparent communication and plain language guidance** 
    * Veterans struggle to understand the way choices are presented in the Supplemental Claims form.
    * They do not understand the options presented in decision letters, what constitutes new and relevant information, or duty to assist. 
2. **Veterans expect to be known by VA**
    * Veterans are not experts of our process and expect the VA to know their personal information, their service records and to guide them towards the best outcome. 
3. **Legacy Opt-In and Duty to Assist confuses Veterans**
4. **Veterans do not understand the matching mental model for contentions**
    * Veterans present issues that adjudicators have to interpret and match to contentions for a favorable outcome, but this is not transparent to Veterans. 
    * The concept of matching a contention to a successful outcome causes delays and the burden is on the adjudicator to make the right decision for the Veteran.
5. **Veterans need issue and evidence support**
    * Veterans are not directed to a 4142 within the form - authorization to disclose medical information is an important step for adjudicators gathering evidence.
    * VA Form 21-4138 (Statement in Support of Claim) is not included in the SC flow, but it supports the odds of claim approval.
6. **There may be opportunities to presumptively connect Veterans who are eligible under the PACT Act**
    * Veterans could potentially be presumptively connected based on previous denial and the time and location of their service, under the PACT Act.
7. **Adjudicators experience a lot of signature errors. Signature support and authorization is unclear**
8. **There is opportunity to support housing insecurity**
    * Housing insecurity and gender choice patterns are not included in this form
9. **Research is needed to support the specific needs of claimants other than the Veteran**

### Recommendations
1. **Communications are confusing**
    - Optimize omni-channel communication with Veterans—for example: leveraging email, text and notifications to supplement snail mail. Chatbot help.
    - Consider the content and guidance for which form is best for a favorable outcome, contentions and evidence, inline help, FAQ and resources and support
    - Consider language in the decision letter
    - Consider upstream opportunities and prompts (MyVA, CST)
2. **Veterans expect to be known by VA**
    - Use the social security number, file number, service number, or other related data to connect disjointed Veteran files. 
    - Predict and Pre-fill issues and authorizations
    - Provide transparency around what is in the efolder and consider surfacing it inline
3. **Legacy Opt-In and Duty to Assist confuses Veterans**
    - Use plain language
    - Provide transparent outcomes for choices
4. **Veterans don't understand the mental model of matching issues to approval**
    - Educate and guide with plain language in decision letters
    - Consider a new interaction pattern that suggests and matches supported contentions
    - Preload current issues with the ability to add supporting evidence
5. **Veterans need issue and evidence support**
    - Display current issues, evidence and ability to add more, ideally with information that matches the decision language letter, code and date of decision.
    - Offer inline support claims and authorizations rather than "attach another form"
    - Provide 4138 statement in support of SC inline to support favorable outcome
    - Provide 4142 fields inline to authorize collection of specific types of evidence.
    - Provide clear guidance examples of evidence needed for a favorable outcome
    - Provide consistent and clear upload guidance for optimal results
6. **There may be opportunities to presumptively connect Veterans who are eligible under the PACT Act**
     - Work with the benefits automation team to identify a strategy to presumptively connect Veterans.
      - Consider an alternate flow for these use cases.
7. **Adjudicators experience a lot of signature errors**
      - See if they already have a POA on file
      - Provide plain language guidance and ability to authorize signature
8. **There is opportunity to support housing insecurity**
    - Add housing insecurity pattern to the flow
9. **Research is needed to support the specific needs of claimants other than the Veteran**
    - Discover specific needs around roles and permissions
    - Understand specific constraints and privacy issues for Veterans and claimants acting on their behalf
