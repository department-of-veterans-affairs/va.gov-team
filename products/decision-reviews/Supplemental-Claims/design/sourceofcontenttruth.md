## File a Supplemental Claim
VA Form 20-0995

If you disagree with our decision on your claim, a Supplemental Claim may be an option for you.

Action Link: Start your claim

### Follow these steps to get started

#### 1. Check your eligibility
You can file a Supplemental Claim if you meet at least 1 of these requirements: 
- You have new and relevant evidence that we didn’t consider before, or
- You have a condition that we now consider presumptive (such as under the PACT Act)

What's a presumptive condition? (expand)

>For some conditions, we automatically assume (or “presume”) that your service caused your condition. We call these “presumptive conditions.”
>
>If you have a presumptive condition, you don’t need to prove that your service caused the condition. You only need to meet the service requirements for the presumption.
>
>[Learn more about the PACT Act](https://www.va.gov/resources/the-pact-act-and-your-va-benefits/)

You can file a Supplemental Claim if you have new and relevant evidence that we didn't have when we reviewed your case before. You can file your claim anytime, but we recommend you file within 1 year from the date on your decision letter.

**Note:** You can’t file a Supplemental Claim if you have a fiduciary claim or a contested claim.

- New evidence. You can either submit new evidence (supporting documents) or identify new evidence you want us to gather for you. **Note:** If you have a condition that we consider presumptive under a new law or regulation (such as the PACT Act), you don't need to submit evidence to prove that your service caused the condition.
- The decision date of any issue you want us to review. You can ask us to review more than 1 issue.
- The name and address of any private medical facility you’d like us to request your records from.
- The dates you were treated at that private medical facility.

### Privacy Act Statement

**Respondent Burden:** We need this information to determine your eligibility for benefits (38 U.S.C. 3471). Title 38, United States Code, allows us to ask for this information. We estimate that you will need an average of 15 minutes to review the instructions, find the information, and complete this form. The VA cannot conduct or sponsor a collection of information unless a valid OMB (Office of Management and Budget) control number is displayed. You are not required to respond to a collection of information if this number is not displayed. Valid OMB control numbers can be located on the [OMB Internet Page (opens in a new tab)](www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain). If desired, you can call 800-827-1000 to get information on where to send comments or suggestions about this form.

**Privacy Act Notice:** VA will not disclose information collected on this form to any source other than what has been authorized under the Privacy Act of 1974 or Title 38, Code of Federal Regulations 1.576 for routine uses (i.e., civil or criminal law enforcement, congressional communications, epidemiological or research studies, the collection of money owed to the United States, litigation in which the United States is a party or has an interest, the administration of VA programs and delivery of VA benefits, verification of identity and status, and personnel administration) as
identified in the following VA systems of records published in the Federal Register: 58/VA21/22/28, Compensation, Pension, Education and Veterans Readiness and Employment Records -VA; 55VA26 Loan Guaranty Home, Condominium and Manufactured Home Loan Applicant Records, Specially Adapted Housing Applicant Records, and Vendee Loan Applicant Records -VA; and 36VA29, Veterans and Armed Forces Personnel Programs of Government Life Insurance -VA. Your obligation to respond is required to obtain or retain benefits. VA uses your SSN to identify your claims file. Providing your SSN will help ensure that your records are properly associated with your claim file. Giving us your SSN account information is voluntary. Refusal to provide your
SSN by itself will not result in the denial of benefits. VA will not deny an individual benefits for refusing to provide his or her SSN unless the disclosure of the SSN is required by a Federal Statute of law in effect prior to January 1, 1975, and still in effect. The requested information is considered relevant and necessary to determine maximum benefits under the law. The responses you submit are considered confidential (38 U.S.C. 5701). Information submitted is subject to verification through computer matching programs with other agencies.

*If veteran does not have an Intent to File*

## You submitted an Intent to File
By starting this Supplemental Claim request, you automatically submitted an Intent to File. Your Intent to File will expire on February 7, 2024.

**Note:** We found in our records an Intent to File that expired on February 24, 2022. There are 2 possible reasons you have an expired Intent to File. You may have started an application that you didn't finish before the Intent to File expired. Or, you may have already submitted the claim connected to this Intent to File.

What's an Intent to File? (expand) \

>When you submit an Intent to File, you're telling us that you plan to file a claim. This sets a potential start date (called an effective date) for when you could start getting benefits. It gives you time to prepare your claim and gather supporting documents. And it means that your start date for benefits may be earlier than the date you file your claim.

If you're filing a Supplemental Claim in response to a Statement of the Case (SOC) or a Supplemental Statement of the Case (SSOC) in the old appeals process (for a VA decision you received before February 19, 2019), you're opting into the new decision review process. You must opt in within 60 days from the date you received your SOC or SSOC.

Once you opt in, we’ll move your claim from the old appeals process to the new decision review process. You won't be able to return to the old appeals process for the issues you have selected. You’re likely to get a faster decision on your claim when you switch to the new process.

If you want to continue your claim in the old appeals process, don't submit a Supplemental Claim. Check your decision notice for more details about the appeals process.

1. All records and other information regarding my treatment, hospitalization, and outpatient care for my impairment(s) including, but not limited to:

- Psychological, psychiatric, or other mental impairment(s) excluding "psychotherapy notes" as defined in 45 C.F.R. §164.501,
- Drug abuse, alcoholism, or other substance abuse,
- Sickle cell anemia,
- Records which may indicate the presence of a communicable or non-    communicable disease; and tests for or records of HIV/AIDS,
- Gene-related impairments (including genetic test results)

2. Information about how my impairment(s) affects my ability to complete tasks and activities of daily living, and affects my ability to work.

3. Information created within 12 months after the date this authorization is signed in Item 11, as well as past information.

You should not complete this form unless you want the VA to obtain private treatment records on your behalf. If you have already provided these records or intend to obtain them yourself, there is no need to fill out this form. Doing so will lengthen your claim processing time.

In accordance with 38 C.F.R. §3.159(c), "VA will not pay any fees charged by a custodian to provide records requested."

I hereby authorize the sources listed in Section IV, to release any information that may have been obtained in connection with a physical, psychological or psychiatric examination or treatment, with the understanding that VA will use this information in determining my eligibility to veterans benefits I have claimed.

I understand that the source being asked to provide the Veterans Benefits Administration with records under this authorization may not require me to execute this authorization before it provides me with treatment, payment for health care, enrollment in a health plan, or eligibility for benefits provided by it.

I understand that once my source sends this information to VA under this authorization, the information will no longer be protected by the HIPAA Privacy Rule, but will be protected by the Federal Privacy Act, 5 USC 552a, and VA may disclose this information as authorized by law.

I also understand that I may revoke this authorization in writing, at any time except to the extent a source of information has already relied on it to take an action. To revoke, I must send a written statement to the VA Regional Office handling my claim or the Board of Veterans' Appeals (if my claim is related to an appeal) and also send a copy directly to any of my sources that I no longer wish to disclose information about me.

I understand that VA may use information disclosed prior to revocation to decide my claim.

- [ ] I acknowledge and authorize this release of information (*Required)
