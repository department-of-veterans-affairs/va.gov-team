## You submitted an Intent to File
By starting this Supplemental Claim request, you automatically submitted an Intent to File. Your Intent to File will expire on February 7, 2024.

**Note:** We found in our records an Intent to File that expired on February 24, 2022. There are 2 possible reasons you have an expired Intent to File. You may have started an application that you didn't finish before the Intent to File expired. Or, you may have already submitted the claim connected to this Intent to File.

What's an Intent to File? (expand) \

When you submit an Intent to File, you're telling us that you plan to file a claim. This sets a potential start date (called an effective date) for when you could start getting benefits. It gives you time to prepare your claim and gather supporting documents. And it means that your start date for benefits may be earlier than the date you file your claim.

**We need your authorization to request your medical records**

I voluntarily authorize and request disclosure (including paper, oral, and electronic interchange) of: All my medical records; including information related to my ability to perform tasks of daily living. This includes specific permission to release:

1. All records and other information   regarding my treatment, hospitalization, and outpatient care for my impairment(s) including, but not limited to:

•  Psychological, psychiatric, or other mental impairment(s) excluding "psychotherapy notes" as defined in 45 C.F.R. §164.501,

•  Drug abuse, alcoholism, or other substance abuse,

•  Sickle cell anemia,

•  Records which may indicate the presence of a communicable or non-communicable disease; and tests for or records of HIV/AIDS,

•  Gene-related impairments (including genetic test results)

2. Information about how my impairment(s) affects my ability to complete tasks and activities of daily living, and affects my ability to work.

3. Information created within 12 months after the date this authorization is signed in Item 11, as well as past information.

You should not complete this form unless you want the VA to obtain private treatment records on your behalf. If you have already provided these records or intend to obtain them yourself, there is no need to fill out this form. Doing so will lengthen your claim processing time.

In accordance with 38 C.F.R. §3.159(c), "VA will not pay any fees charged by a custodian to provide records requested."

I hereby authorize the sources listed in Section IV, to release any information that may have been obtained in connection with a physical, psychological or psychiatric examination or treatment, with the understanding that VA will use this information in determining my eligibility to veterans benefits I have claimed.

I understand that the source being asked to provide the Veterans Benefits Administration with records under this authorization may not require me to execute this authorization before it provides me with treatment, payment for health care, enrollment in a health plan, or eligibility for benefits provided by it.

I understand that once my source sends this information to VA under this authorization, the information will no longer be protected by the HIPAA Privacy Rule, but will be protected by the Federal Privacy Act, 5 USC 552a, and VA may disclose this information as authorized by law.

I also understand that I may revoke this authorization in writing, at any time except to the extent a source of information has already relied on it to take an action. To revoke, I must send a written statement to the VA Regional Office handling my claim or the Board of Veterans' Appeals (if my claim is related to an appeal) and also send a copy directly to any of my sources that I no longer wish to disclose information about me.

I understand that VA may use information disclosed prior to revocation to decide my claim.

### Follow these steps to get started

#### 1. Check your eligibility
You can file a Supplemental Claim if you meet at least 1 of these requirements:
- You have new and relevant evidence that we didn't consider before, **or** 
- You have a condition that we now consider presumptive (such as under the [PACT Act](https://www.va.gov/resources/the-pact-act-and-your-va-benefits/))

You can file your claim anytime, but we recommend you file within 1 year from the date on your decision letter.

**Note:** You can’t file a Supplemental Claim if you have a fiduciary claim or a contested claim.

If you don’t think this is the right form for you, you can go back to answer the questions again.

LINK: Go back to the questions

What's a presumptive condition? (Expand) \

For some conditions, we automatically assume (or “presume”) that your service caused your condition. We call these “presumptive conditions.”

If you have a presumptive condition, you don’t need to prove that your service caused the condition. You only need to meet the service requirements for the presumption.

[Learn more about the PACT Act](https://www.va.gov/resources/the-pact-act-and-your-va-benefits/)

#### 2. Gather your information
Here’s what you’ll need to apply: 

**New evidence.** You can either submit new evidence (supporting documents) or identify new evidence you want us to gather for you.
**Note:** If you have a condition that we consider presumptive under a new law or regulation (such as the PACT Act), you don't need to submit evidence to prove that your service caused the condition.

**The decision date of any issue you want us to review.** You can ask us to review more than 1 issue.

**The name and address of any private medical facility you'd like us to request your records from.**

**The dates you were treated at that private medical facility.**

Types of Evidence (expand) \

VA medical records and hospital records that relate to your claimed condition or that show your rated disability or how it has gotten worse

Private medical records and hospital reports that relate to your claimed condition or show that your disability has gotten worse

Supporting statements from family, friends, coworkers, clergy, or law enforcement personnel with knowledge about how and when your disability happened or how it has gotten worse

#### 3. Start your Supplemental Claim
We’ll take you through each step of the process. It should take about 15 minutes.

What happens after I apply? (expand) \

You don’t need to do anything while you’re waiting unless we contact you to ask for more information. If we schedule exams for you, be sure not to miss them.

Respondent burden: 15 minutes

## STEP 3 of 4: New evidence

We'll save your application every time you add or update information.

_Informational alert:_

### If you have a presumptive condition

If you're filing a claim for a condition that we now consider presumptive under a new law or regulation (like the PACT Act), you don't need to submit new evidence. But you do need to review and acknowledge this notice of evidence needed. 

**Review and acknowledge this notice of evidence needed.**

Unless you're filing a claim for a presumptive condition, we encourage you to submit new evidence. This evidence must be related to the issue you’re claiming, and it must be evidence we haven't reviewed before.

We’ll look for evidence that shows both of these are true:

You have a current physical or mental disability (damage to your body or mind that makes you less able—or totally unable—to do everyday tasks, including meaningful work), **and**

An event, injury, or illness that happened while you were serving in the military caused this disability

You'll need to submit or give us permission to gather medical evidence from a VA medical center, other federal facility, or your private health care provider.

- [ ] I certify that I have reviewed the notice of evidence needed. (*Required)

**_CONTINUE_**

_Error_: You need to certify that you've reviewed the notice of evidence needed.

## STEP 3 of 4: New evidence

We'll save your application every time you add or update information.

_Warning alert:_

### We noticed you didn't add new evidence

If you have a presumptive condition, you don’t need to submit new evidence with your claim. You can continue through this form.

If you’re filing a claim based on new evidence, we encourage you to submit the evidence with your claim. But if you don't have the evidence now, you can still file your claim. We'll work with you to get the evidence.
