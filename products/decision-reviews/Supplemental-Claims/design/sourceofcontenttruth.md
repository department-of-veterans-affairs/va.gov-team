**You’ll need to review and acknowledge this notice of evidence needed.**

You’ll need to submit new evidence we haven’t reviewed before that’s related to the issue you’re claiming.

We’ll look for evidence that shows:

You have a current physical or mental disability (damage to your body or mind that makes you less able—or totally unable—to do everyday tasks, including meaningful work), and

An event, injury, or illness that happened while you were serving in the military caused this disability

You'll need to submit or give us permission to gather medical evidence from a VA medical center, other federal facility, or your private health care provider.

- [ ] I certify that I have reviewed the notice of evidence needed.

Select your record types: (*Required)

- [ ] VA medical records
- [ ] Private medical records
- [ ] Supporting (lay) statements, other evidence, or upload your documents

Which evidence should I choose? (expand)

Types of evidence

VA medical records
If you were treated at a VA medical center or clinic, or by a doctor through the TRICARE health care program, you’ll have VA medical records.

Private medical records
If you were treated by a private doctor, including a Veteran’s Choice doctor, you’ll have private medical records. We’ll need to see those records to make a decision on your claim. A Disability Benefits Questionnaire is an example of a private medical record.

Lay statements or other
A lay statement is a written statement from family, friends, or coworkers to help support your claim. Lay statements are also called “buddy statements.” In most cases, you’ll only need your medical records to support your disability claim. But some claims—such as those for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder or military sexual trauma—could benefit from a lay or buddy statement.

You upload your medical records

If you upload a digital copy of all your medical records, we can review your claim more quickly. Uploading a digital file works best if you have a computer with a fast Internet connection. The digital file can only be uploaded as a pdf.

We get your medical records for you

If you tell us the name of the private doctor or hospital that treated you for your condition, we can get your medical records for you. Getting your records may take us some time, and this could mean that it’ll take us longer to make a decision on your claim.

**We need your authorization to request your medical records**

I voluntarily authorize and request disclosure (including paper, oral, and electronic interchange) of: All my medical records; including information related to my ability to perform tasks of daily living. This includes specific permission to release:

1. All records and other information   regarding my treatment, hospitalization, and outpatient care for my impairment(s) including, but not limited to:

•  Psychological, psychiatric, or other mental impairment(s) excluding "psychotherapy notes" as defined in 45 C.F.R. §164.501,
•  Drug abuse, alcoholism, or other substance abuse,
•  Sickle cell anemia,
•  Records which may indicate the presence of a communicable or non-communicable disease; and tests for or records of HIV/AIDS,
•  Gene-related impairments (including genetic test results)

2. Information about how my impairment(s) affects my ability to complete tasks and activities of daily living, and affects my ability to work.

3. Information created within 12 months after the date this authorization is signed in Item 11, as well as past information.
You should not complete this form unless you want the VA to obtain private treatment records on your behalf. If you have already provided these records or intend to obtain them yourself, there is no need to fill out this form. Doing so will lengthen your claim processing time.
In accordance with 38 C.F.R. §3.159(c), "VA will not pay any fees charged by a custodian to provide records requested."
I hereby authorize the sources listed in Section IV, to release any information that may have been obtained in connection with a physical, psychological or psychiatric examination or treatment, with the understanding that VA will use this information in determining my eligibility to veterans benefits I have claimed.

I understand that the source being asked to provide the Veterans Benefits Administration with records under this authorization may not require me to execute this authorization before it provides me with treatment, payment for health care, enrollment in a health plan, or eligibility for benefits provided by it.

I understand that once my source sends this information to VA under this authorization, the information will no longer be protected by the HIPAA Privacy Rule, but will be protected by the Federal Privacy Act, 5 USC 552a, and VA may disclose this information as authorized by law.

I also understand that I may revoke this authorization in writing, at any time except to the extent a source of information has already relied on it to take an action. To revoke, I must send a written statement to the VA Regional Office handling my claim or the Board of Veterans' Appeals (if my claim is related to an appeal) and also send a copy directly to any of my sources that I no longer wish to disclose information about me.

I understand that VA may use information disclosed prior to revocation to decide my claim.

IF Supporting (lay) statements, other evidence or upload your documents

**Upload your evidence**(*Required)

You’ll need to upload new and relevant evidence for your Supplemental Claim. This may include supporting statements (also known as lay statements), and other types of evidence. We’ll prompt you to upload each document from your device, but you may first need to scan your document, then save each file as a PDF and upload it.

You can do this one of several ways:

If you have access to a computer connected to a scanner, you can scan each document onto the computer. Save the file as a PDF.

If you have access to a smartphone, you can download or use the Notes app (for an iPhone) or the Google Drive app (for an Android phone) to scan each document onto the phone. The file will automatically save as a PDF when you’re done scanning.

A 1MB file equals about 500 pages of text. A photo is usually about 6MB. Large files can take longer to upload with a slow Internet connection.
