## Moderator logistics 
2-3 days before the session
[!NOTE] Review VA Platform's Research Checklist.
List and complete any project-specific setup tasks for this study below:
Create note-taking doc (?) for sessions. 
Slack channel creation / communication


## Day of the session
Use #feedback-backchannel in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.
Mute your Slack notifications.
Send out the observer instructions to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into #feedback-backchannel).


## Starting the session
* In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.
* In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked
* Check your [screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants.
* When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*


## Section 1: Introduction - 5-10 minutes
Thank you so much for joining us today! My name is **[NAME]** and I work at VA.gov to help improve access to benefits and services for Veterans like you. **[NOTETAKER NAME]** will be taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...

Today we're going to talk about choosing a decision review pathway. We’re working on an online guide to assist Veterans with exploring the review options available after a disability claim decision has been made. I’ll walk you through the guide and ask for your honest feedback so we can improve it.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:
* **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure to end on time, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your skills, knowledge, or abilities. We’re here to learn from your perspective, so please share your thoughts openly. All feedback is welcome.
* **Whenever you can, please talk out loud to share your thought process as you complete tasks.** This will help me understand your experience. I might remind you to think out loud because this can feel unnatural and be easy to forget.
* **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know. If you decide you need to stop at any time, you’ll still be compensated for your time.
* **I want you to know that although I work on the VA.gov website, I have no access to your records or benefits, nor do I have the ability to change your claims or benefits in any way.** I am not a specialist in benefits. My primary focus is to understand your experience with the website.
* That was a lot of information. Are you okay with proceeding with the agenda I’ve proposed for today’s session?
* The people from Perigean who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Is it okay with you to have  one person join us to observe this session?
	If no:
     * Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.

If yes: 
     * Admit observers.
	 * Then, ask the notetaker and observers to **give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov.** (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
     * Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth

* **You'll be interacting with a prototype today.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas and links of the prototype will be functional, and some will not. **Since this is only a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.**

* **I’d like to ask your permission to record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are deleted, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.
    * **Knowing that, is it okay with you if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
    * If yes,  ➡️ **Have the Notetaker start the recording.**
    * **Reminder to Notetaker:** After you start the recording, select the “Show captions (CC)” button to enable transcription for the recording.
I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Is it okay with you if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

**[Record answer here]**

**Warm-up Questions**
“Before we look at the prototype, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. Just to confirm, you mentioned during recruitment that you’ve previously filed a disability compensation claim with the VA—is that correct? 
	* How long ago was that - when did you last file a VA benefits claim? 
	* Have you received a decision for that claim?

2. Have you ever challenged a VA claim decision or filed a VA decision review before? 
Which claim review option did you choose? Supplemental Claim, Higher-Level Review, or Board Appeal? (could also be the US Court of Appeals. In the future, Motion to Vacate, Motion to Reconsider, CUE)

3. Did you file the decision review yourself, or did you work with a VSO or an attorney on your behalf?
If they filed themselves: Can you walk me through how you first learned about the different VA decision review options—and what factors helped you decide which one to choose?

Facilitator: Copy and paste the rating options from the Appendix into Zoom Chat for visual reference:

4. On a scale of 1-4, how well do you currently feel you understand the decision review options, the requirements, and which one might apply to your situation?
    1 - I don’t understand them at all (No awareness / high confusion)  
    2 - I understand them a little (Basic or initial understanding of concept; can’t explain in detail)    
    3 - I understand them well (Can outline DR steps and select one confidently, has completed a DR in the past)
    4 - I understand them very well (Could explain each option to another Veteran, has completed a DR in the past)


## Section 2: Work through their own situation - 20-25 minutes
## Set the Task
“For today’s session, imagine you’re on VA.gov, looking to ask VA to reconsider your disability benefits decision. You will be navigating through a guide to explore the review options available to you, to help you select the decision review option that fits your needs. The guide will ask a few high-level questions—no sensitive details—and anything you enter is for testing purposes only; none of the information you enter will impact your benefits in any way.” If it’s okay with you, we’d like you to answer the questions today as if you were using this on your own- providing answers based on your own personal situation.

**Caveat:** We’re interested in two things: how easy it is to use and does the way the information is presented support your decision making process. Some details haven’t yet been fully aligned with official VA policy, so please don’t rely on the information you see here to make decisions about your own situation.”

Task 1: Launch the guide
Navigate to the Intro screen. “Let's get started. I am going to drop a link in the Zoom chat. When you receive the link, please open the web page.”

**Link:  [https:staging.ca.gov/decision-reviews/explore-disability-claim-decision-review-options](https://staging.va.gov/decision-reviews/explore-disability-claim-decision-review-options)**

“Next, I’d like you to share your screen for the remainder of the session. If you need help figuring out how to share your screen I am happy to troubleshoot.”

* Troubleshooting guide for mobile: [https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-mobile-sessions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-mobile-sessions)
 
 * General troubleshooting: [https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/troubleshooting-for-va-gov-research-sessions-in-pr](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/troubleshooting-for-va-gov-research-sessions-in-pr)

  
## Introduction Screen
“Take some time to read through this screen. When you’re ready, please talk me through what you would expect to do before selecting any links. Please do not select any links or leave the page yet– but tell me verbally if there is an action you would like to take.”

## Intro screen questions
* “In your own words, what do you think the Explore disability claim decision review options guide is for? What do you expect to get out of this guide?”
* “What types of claims do you think this guide supports?”
* “What, if anything, would you like to know before starting the guide?”
* If they mention the text in the intro page: ‘This guide isn’t a form you’ll submit to us.’, Ask: “What does that mean to you?”
* “Is there anything on this page that is confusing or unclear that you would like to understand better?”
* “What would you select first on this page and why?”

If the Veteran selects the helper text/accordion links:
* Note which accordions they notice/open
* Note any language or wording that causes hesitation or confusion.

If they click on links, ask:
* “Was this information helpful?”
* “Did this link help you better understand the question being asked in the guide?”
* “Would you prefer links to open a new tab or stay within the same window?”
* “After viewing, where would you expect to return?”


## Task 2: Answer Explore disability claim decision review options questions
“Now that you have had a chance to read through the introductory screen, go ahead and start. Please answer the questions true to your situation, to the best of your ability.  I will mostly just observe you working through this process. If you can, please remember to talk out loud to share your thought process as you read through the guide to help me understand your experience.”

Observe the Veteran working through the questions as they correspond to their own situation.
At the question: ‘What type of claim decision is the one you want us to review?’: 
“Tell me in your own words what you just chose and why.”
Is there confusion or drop-off at the “type of claim” question in flow? 
Yes, participant was confused about “type of claim” question.
No, question was clear
NOTE: If they select the CFI & Disagree path:
If they answer Yes – VA said my condition is service connected to “Did VA decide that your condition is service-connected?” AND
They answer Yes, My condition has gotten worse to “Has your condition gotten worse since you filed this claim?” AND
They answer Yes, I disagree with VA's decision AND my service-connected condition has gotten worse to “Do you disagree with VA's decision?”
This places the user in the BOTH path and will receive an alternate summary screen of which we will ask additional questions.
NOTE: Be sure to ask questions about CFI AND DR Summary Screens here.
Did the user select the BOTH Path?  
Yes
No
Things to watch for:
Note issues or confusion with any of the language or terms used.
Are there common errors observed from misunderstanding questions?
Are there points of tension, friction, or confusion as they work through the questions?
Are there questions or considerations shared/reported?
Note which links the Veteran would select and note any comments they have about the information provided.


## Task 3: Select an option on the summary screen
Was the Veteran able to reach the summary screen successfully and without help?
Yes, participant reached the summary screen successfully.
No, participant didn’t reach the summary screen/needed assistance.
“You’ve reached the summary screen. I’m going to stop you here so that I can ask some questions. Take a minute and read through this page and please describe what you’re experiencing.”
## Summary screen questions
“Is this screen what you expected to find? Why / why not?”


“Now that you have walked through the Guide, given the options presented to you, which option would you choose for your individual situation and why?”
“On a scale of 1-4, how confident are you in selecting that choice?”
1 = Not at all confident
2 = Slightly confident
3 = Very confident

## Section 5: Wrap up - 5 minutes
Consent to use video clips
I want to circle back and ask one more question that we ask all participants about the video recording: Is it okay with you if we share a video clip of part of this session with our VA partners? We'd want to do this if we find a clip that demonstrates the need for an improvement or other helpful example of Veteran needs. We remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and would only share the video clips with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.

If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip? Record answer here:



## Thank you and closing
“We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work to improve the website for Veterans.
Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.
Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!”



## Emergency Exit 🆗
Pause or exit strategies
If the participant can't screen share after troubleshooting
I really appreciate your patience through this. I'm sure you know, it can be really frustrating when technology is not our friend. Since we're not able to set up screen share, we're going to end the session now. You're still going to be compensated for the full session. Thanks again for joining us and we'll hopefully see you back here again for another study.
If the participant isn't feeling well
I'm sorry you're [not feeling well]. Do you feel up for continuing? You'll be paid even if we stop early.
If they choose to continue...
Okay, just let me know if you change your mind.
If the participant is showing signs of upset or distress
This sounds so hard. Would you like to take a break or stop?
If they choose to take a break and come back...
Welcome back. I'm interested to hear more about [topic you left off on]. Are you up for continuing or would you prefer we move to the next topic?
If the participant decides to stop
Thank you for your time today, I completely understand your decision to stop.
If they seem distressed...
Before you go, the VA Hotline number is 988, it's a confidential helpline, and it's 24/7. It's up to you whether you call.
If the participant is fine to continue, but you aren't
I hear that you're okay to continue. Before we do, I realized that I need a minute. I'm going to turn off my camera and microphone, and get a glass of water. Is that okay with you? I'll be back in 3 minutes.
If you're still not able to continue, after you pause...
Thanks for letting me take a break. You didn't do anything wrong, but I'm realizing that I'm not going to be able to continue this session. You will still be paid for the full time. I really appreciate you sharing with me today. Is it okay with you if we stop? Thanks very much.
