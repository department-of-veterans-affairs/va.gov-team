 Notes for Notetaker

## **Section 1: Introduction \- 5-10 minutes**

Thank you so much for joining us today\! My name is **\[NAME\]** and I work at VA.gov to help improve access to benefits and services for Veterans like you. 

**\[NOTETAKER NAME\]** will be taking notes. I also have another colleague in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...

Today we're going to talk about choosing a decision review pathway. We’re working on an online guide to assist Veterans with exploring the review options available after a disability claim decision has been made. I’ll walk you through the guide and ask for your honest feedback so we can improve it.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

* **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure to end on time, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

* **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your skills, knowledge, or abilities. We’re here to learn from your perspective, so please share your thoughts openly. All feedback is welcome.

* **Whenever you can, please talk out loud to share your thought process as you complete tasks.** This will help me understand your experience. I might remind you to think out loud because this can feel unnatural and be easy to forget.

* **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know. If you decide you need to stop at any time, you’ll still be compensated for your time.

* **I want you to know that although I work on the VA.gov website, I have no access to your records or benefits, nor do I have the ability to change your claims or benefits in any way**. I am not a specialist in benefits. My primary focus is to understand your experience with the website.

* That was a lot of information. Are you okay with proceeding with the agenda I’ve proposed for today’s session?

* The people from Perigean who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Is it okay with you to have  one person join us to observe this session?**

	**If no:** Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.

**If yes:** Admit observers.

* Then, ask the notetaker and observers to **give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov.** (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)  
  * Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth  
      
* **You'll be interacting with a prototype today.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas and links of the prototype will be functional, and some will not. **Since this is only a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.**


* **I’d like to ask your permission to record my screen and audio as we talk today.** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are deleted, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.

  * **Knowing that, is it okay with you if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**  
  * If yes,  ➡️ **Have the Notetaker start the recording.**  
    * **Reminder to Notetaker:** After you start the recording, select the “Show captions (CC)” button to enable transcription for the recording.  
* **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Is it okay with you if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

**Record answer here:**

## **Section 2: Work through their own situation \- 20-25 minutes**

### Set the Task

“For today’s session, imagine you’re on VA.gov, looking to ask VA to reconsider your disability benefits decision. You will be navigating through a guide to explore the review options available to you, to help you select the decision review option that fits your needs. The guide will ask a few high-level questions—no sensitive details—and anything you enter is for testing purposes only; none of the information you enter will impact your benefits in any way. If it’s okay with you, we’d like you to answer the questions today as if you were using this on your own- providing answers based on your own personal situation.”

**Caveat**: We’re interested in two things: how easy it is to use and does the way the information is presented support your decision making process. Some details haven’t yet been fully aligned with official VA policy, so please don’t rely on the information you see here to make decisions about your own situation.”

### Task 1: Launch the guide

**Navigate to the Intro screen.** “Let's get started. First, I am going to drop a link in the Zoom chat. When you receive the link, please open the web page.”

**Link**:   [https://staging.va.gov/decision-reviews/explore-disability-claim-decision-review-options](https://staging.va.gov/decision-reviews/explore-disability-claim-decision-review-options) 

“Next, I’d like you to **share your window** for the remainder of the session. If you need help figuring out how to share your window I am happy to troubleshoot.”

#### 

#### Introduction Screen

“**Take some time to read through this screen.** When you’re ready, please talk to me about what you might expect to do before selecting any links. Please do not select any links or leave the page yet – but tell me verbally if there is an action you would like to take.”

Note:  

#### Intro screen questions

9. In your own words, what do you think the ***Explore disability claim decision review options*** guide is for? What do you expect to get out of this guide?

Note:  it seems to me that…we may not understand what you’re being pacific about, or what the claim is all about…theyre pretty good about telling you its gonna take a while…responding to statement of the case, in other words…Looking for other decision review options, that i font know what that would mean

10. What **types of claims** do you think this guide supports?

Note:  i would guess, in my opinion, vietnam vet, something to do with agent orange or if you were disabled physically, thats what im assuming

11. What, if anything, would you like to **know *before* starting the guide**?

Note:  probably how much theyre gonna sk you for specifically…when i filed my claim it said,..at that time you werent, you have to be in a drift zone for agent orange and that is ridiculous as heck…you know they sprayed the perimeter and…eventually with the PACT ACt they said you were there and that ounts, and that took a lot of stuff to prove, where i was, where i lived, where i worked, and i thought that was the VA not being honest, to be honest with you 

:26

12. On the Intro page, under the bullets it says: *‘This guide isn’t a form you’ll submit to us.’*  **What does that mean** to you?

Note:  trying to verify or get an idea of what the problem you have is or where they should send you with questions you have

13. Is there anything on this page that is **confusing** or **unclear** that you would like to understand better?

Note:  responding to statement of case (SOC…) i dont know what that means 

14. What would you **select first** on this page and why?

Note:  right now for me, i filed an intent to file which runs out this month, so havent filed a claim yet would be my choice…

###### ➡️ If the Veteran selects the **helper text/accordion** links, ask:

15. Which accordions did they notice/open?

Note:  havent filed a claim yet accordion

16. Was there any language or **wording** that caused hesitation or **confusion**?

Note:  that makes sense i get that

###### ➡️ If they click on any of the **links**, ask:

17. Was this information **helpful**?

Note:


18. Did this link help you **better understand** the question being asked in the guide?

Note:


19. Would you prefer links to **open a new tab** or **stay within the same window**?

Note:


20. After viewing, where would you **expect to return**?

Note:

### 

###  Task 2: Answer *Explore disability claim DR options* questions

**“Now that you have had a chance to read through the introductory screen, please go ahead and start. Answer the questions true to your situation, to the best of your ability.**  I will mostly just observe you working through this process. If you can, please remember to talk out loud to share your thought process as you read through the guide to help me understand your experience.”

*👀 Notetaker:* Things to watch for

Observe the Veteran working through the questions as they correspond to their own situation.

* Any issues or confusion with any of the language or terms used?  
* Common errors observed from misunderstanding questions?  
* Are there points of tension, friction, or confusion as they work through the questions?  
* Are there questions or considerations shared/reported?  
* Note which links the Veteran would select and note any comments they have about the information provided.

Note:  

* The only other thing…only thing down below that is (other accordions)...says below that need help  
* I dont know what im looking, i dont know what that would mean…  
* Task 1 \- fail  
* If youre filing a claim, really it wouldnt be a supplemental would it…  
  * Rereads page again, after redirected to top of page  
  * Then finds explore your options  
    * Seems to hover over preview of link. & we lost connection to screenshare  
* 1.0- seems to skip header and read body and answers  
  * Confusion on what to choose, but not sure which claim question is referring to  
  * Thinking through agent orange case…  
    * :36  
  * “In that case would I call for help?”  
    * I probably would because im not sure which one they would want me to do…  
  * Lauren redirects back to case study shared in warm up questions   
    * Trying to understand if he got an answer on the HLR  
      * If ive already been given an answer on a higher level, i dont know where there is to go after that :39  
    * Expresses lots of concerns/thoughts on PACT ACT  
    * Lauren directs to answer yes  
    * “Hit continue right?”  
* [2.IS](http://2.IS).1-  On first initial one, did not, on pact act they did  
  * Lets go with first one  
* 2.0 \- for my second claim i would tap the initial claim. Claim for increase  
  * Veteran seems to skip over some of the option titles “higher level review” and read hint text  
  * If on second claim, \#1, on the second one…i guess a senior reviewer did review my previous claim  
* Since considering 2 different claims, had dificulty answering questions based on one or another

**If the user gets to question 2.0: ‘*What type of claim decision is the one you want us to review?***’ ask the following: 

21. Tell me in your own words **what you just chose** and why.

Note:  SKIP

My personnel records have been lost since 1991…the only thing i have is a ….subsequentally they sent me a form that said i did serve and where..that is a really high hurdle when you are doing this sort of stuff. Ive had the senators in my state….and nobody can find my records

:45

22. Is there **confusion or drop-off at the “type of claim” question** in flow?   
    - [x] Yes, the participant was confused about the “type of claim” question.

Note:  see notes above

### Task 3: Select an option on the summary screen

* Reads through all options in not an option section  
* It makes sense, yeah

25. Now that you have walked through the Guide, given the options presented to you, **which option would you choose** for your individual situation and why?

Note:  id say uh…supplemental claim probably, because its really based on the same thing. I have another condition that is caused by agent orange and i would think it would be the same kind of thing…

### Consent to use video clips

I want to circle back and ask one more question that we ask all participants about the video recording: **Is it okay with you if we share a video clip of part of this session with our VA partners?** We'd want to do this if we find a clip that demonstrates the need for an improvement or other helpful example of Veteran needs. We remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and would only share the video clips with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.

- [x] Yes  
      - [ ] No  
            

      **If yes:** Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip? Record answer here:  
            Note:  no  
      

### Thank you and closing

“We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work to improve the website for Veterans.

Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day\!”

# Emergency Exit 🆗

## **Pause or exit strategies**

**If the participant can't screen share after troubleshooting**

I really appreciate your patience through this. I'm sure you know, it can be really frustrating when technology is not our friend. Since we're not able to set up screen share, we're going to end the session now. You're still going to be compensated for the full session. Thanks again for joining us and we'll hopefully see you back here again for another study.

**If the participant isn't feeling well**

I'm sorry you're \[not feeling well\]. Do you feel up for continuing? You'll be paid even if we stop early.  
If they choose to continue...  
Okay, just let me know if you change your mind.

**If the participant is showing signs of upset or distress**

This sounds so hard. Would you like to take a break or stop?  
If they choose to take a break and come back...  
Welcome back. I'm interested to hear more about \[topic you left off on\]. Are you up for continuing or would you prefer we move to the next topic?

**If the participant decides to stop**

Thank you for your time today, I completely understand your decision to stop.  
If they seem distressed...  
Before you go, the VA Hotline number is 988, it's a confidential helpline, and it's 24/7. It's up to you whether you call.

**If the participant is fine to continue, but you aren't**

I hear that you're okay to continue. Before we do, I realized that I need a minute. I'm going to turn off my camera and microphone, and get a glass of water. Is that okay with you? I'll be back in 3 minutes.

If you're still not able to continue, after you pause...  
Thanks for letting me take a break. You didn't do anything wrong, but I'm realizing that I'm not going to be able to continue this session. You will still be paid for the full time. I really appreciate you sharing with me today. Is it okay with you if we stop? Thanks very much.
