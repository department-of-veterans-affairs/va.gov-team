 Notes for Notetaker

## **Section 1: Introduction \- 5-10 minutes**

Thank you so much for joining us today\! My name is **\[NAME\]** and I work at VA.gov to help improve access to benefits and services for Veterans like you. 

**\[NOTETAKER NAME\]** will be taking notes. I also have another colleague in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...

Today we're going to talk about choosing a decision review pathway. We‚Äôre working on an online guide to assist Veterans with exploring the review options available after a disability claim decision has been made. I‚Äôll walk you through the guide and ask for your honest feedback so we can improve it.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

* **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure to end on time, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

* **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your skills, knowledge, or abilities. We‚Äôre here to learn from your perspective, so please share your thoughts openly. All feedback is welcome.

* **Whenever you can, please talk out loud to share your thought process as you complete tasks.** This will help me understand your experience. I might remind you to think out loud because this can feel unnatural and be easy to forget.

* **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know. If you decide you need to stop at any time, you‚Äôll still be compensated for your time.

* **I want you to know that although I work on the VA.gov website, I have no access to your records or benefits, nor do I have the ability to change your claims or benefits in any way**. I am not a specialist in benefits. My primary focus is to understand your experience with the website.

* That was a lot of information. Are you okay with proceeding with the agenda I‚Äôve proposed for today‚Äôs session?

* The people from Perigean who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Is it okay with you to have  one person join us to observe this session?**

	**If no:** Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.

**If yes:** Admit observers.

* Then, ask the notetaker and observers to **give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov.** (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)  
  * Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth  
      
* **You'll be interacting with a prototype today.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas and links of the prototype will be functional, and some will not. **Since this is only a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.**


* **I‚Äôd like to ask your permission to record my screen and audio as we talk today.** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are deleted, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.

  * **Knowing that, is it okay with you if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**  
  * If yes,  ‚û°Ô∏è **Have the Notetaker start the recording.**  
    * **Reminder to Notetaker:** After you start the recording, select the ‚ÄúShow captions (CC)‚Äù button to enable transcription for the recording.  
* **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Is it okay with you if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

**Record answer here:**

### Task 1: Launch the guide

**Navigate to the Intro screen.** ‚ÄúLet's get started. First, I am going to drop a link in the Zoom chat. When you receive the link, please open the web page.‚Äù

**Link**:   [https://staging.va.gov/decision-reviews/explore-disability-claim-decision-review-options](https://staging.va.gov/decision-reviews/explore-disability-claim-decision-review-options) 

‚ÄúNext, I‚Äôd like you to **share your window** for the remainder of the session. If you need help figuring out how to share your window I am happy to troubleshoot.‚Äù

\[Troubleshooting guide for mobile: [https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-mobile-sessions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-mobile-sessions)

### General troubleshooting: [https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/troubleshooting-for-va-gov-research-sessions-in-pr](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/troubleshooting-for-va-gov-research-sessions-in-pr) \]

### 

### Set the Task

‚ÄúPlease do not select any links or leave the page yet.   

For today‚Äôs session, imagine you‚Äôre on VA.gov, looking to ask VA to reconsider your disability benefits decision. You will be navigating through a guide to explore the review options available to you, to help you select the decision review option that fits your needs. The guide will ask a few high-level questions‚Äîno sensitive details‚Äîand anything you enter is for testing purposes only; none of the information you enter will impact your benefits in any way. If it‚Äôs okay with you, we‚Äôd like you to answer the questions today as if you were using this on your own- providing answers based on your own personal situation.‚Äù

**Caveat**: We‚Äôre interested in two things: how easy it is to use and does the way the information is presented support your decision making process. Some details haven‚Äôt yet been fully aligned with official VA policy, so please don‚Äôt rely on the information you see here to make decisions about your own situation.‚Äù

#### Introduction Screen

‚Äú**Take some time to read through this screen.** When you‚Äôre ready, please talk to me about what you might expect to do before selecting any links. ‚Äù

Note:  

* Well one thing i would do is‚Ä¶if i was staring out the first time and i had no idea what they were gonna do for a physical check, and what paperwork the‚Ä¶actually it was king of confusing, i realize now that paperwork, physical evidence‚Ä¶.these things didnt start till i was much older, and my medical records were incomplete‚Ä¶  
* :16  
* As i look at this section, there are three here‚Ä¶and actually i dont think it‚Äôs in the right order. If you filing a supplemental claim, it would be like an addition to a claim you already have‚Ä¶.if someone knew how to connect a service‚Ä¶you know i didn‚Äôt ‚Ä¶and when you go, they have VSOs, a lot of times they don‚Äôt understand that either‚Ä¶they dont always convey it to you, thats why i hired a lawyer because the VSOs werent giving me the answers i needed.  
* The board appeal, that was pretty much evidence based‚Ä¶if i went to a board appeal without a lawyer i would have failed.  
* A lot of this, you couldnt do without help, you couldnt do on your own  
* :19  
* Usually what they do is when you get a claim back, they will put on there why it was denied‚Ä¶not service-connected‚Ä¶it might be denied just because the paperwork isn‚Äôt right. The whole system needs to be made simpler. Its set up‚Ä¶.like courts, like a criminal court, they set its up so its almost impossible to do without a lawyer  
* :20

#### Intro screen questions

9. In your own words, what do you think the ***Explore disability claim decision review options*** guide is for? What do you expect to get out of this guide?

Note:  i believe this is information, telling you what your options are

10. What **types of claims** do you think this guide supports?

Note:  if you were denied, and you think you have more information, something maybe that ‚Ä¶process

:24

VSO has a lot of control because if they are filling out the paperwork, if they don‚Äôt put all the informatio they could drop the ball and you wouldnt‚Äô notice‚Ä¶

11. What, if anything, would you like to **know *before* starting the guide**?

Note:


12. On the Intro page, under the bullets it says: *‚ÄòThis guide isn‚Äôt a form you‚Äôll submit to us.‚Äô*  **What does that mean** to you?

Note:


13. Is there anything on this page that is **confusing** or **unclear** that you would like to understand better?

Note:  this guide isn;t a form‚Ä¶you‚Äôll be able to review‚Ä¶i want to know what i can do. Where it says no you can request, that is necessary but the two paragraphs ahead confuse it. 

:25

14. What would you **select first** on this page and why?

Note:  in stead of telling you exactly what its gonna do,this form isnt ..submit to us, why even present it then‚Ä¶.i never had two different options, i didnt request HLR, i requested board appeal and i never had to go any higher than that

:22

No, to me supplemental claim would be something on its own merit, this happened to me‚Ä¶i had left shoulder dislcoated in service adn i had neck problems since, and my neck problem is supplemental to my 9original injury, so thats what a supplemental claim is, its an add on, its the same thing

\*\* confusion around 526 / supplemental 

###### ‚û°Ô∏è If the Veteran selects the **helper text/accordion** links, ask:

15. Which accordions did they notice/open?

Note:


16. Was there any language or **wording** that caused hesitation or **confusion**?

Note:


###### ‚û°Ô∏è If they click on any of the **links**, ask:

17. Was this information **helpful**?

Note:


18. Did this link help you **better understand** the question being asked in the guide?

Note:


19. Would you prefer links to **open a new tab** or **stay within the same window**?

Note:


20. After viewing, where would you **expect to return**?

Note:  

### 

### 

### 

###  Task 2: Answer *Explore disability claim DR options* questions

**‚ÄúNow that you have had a chance to read through the introductory screen, please go ahead and start. Answer the questions true to your situation, to the best of your ability.**  I will mostly just observe you working through this process. If you can, please remember to talk out loud to share your thought process as you read through the guide to help me understand your experience.‚Äù

*üëÄ Notetaker:* Things to watch for

Observe the Veteran working through the questions as they correspond to their own situation.

* Any issues or confusion with any of the language or terms used?  
* Common errors observed from misunderstanding questions?  
* Are there points of tension, friction, or confusion as they work through the questions?  
* Are there questions or considerations shared/reported?  
* Note which links the Veteran would select and note any comments they have about the information provided.

Note:  \- Veteran not prompted to start/launch guide, Lauren prompted

**If the user gets to question 2.0: ‚Äò*What type of claim decision is the one you want us to review?***‚Äô ask the following: 

21. Tell me in your own words **what you just chose** and why.

Note:  this claim has already been claimed and im not looking for an increase‚Ä¶you would have to prove that was worse. Supplemental claim is if you have new evidence, or an addition from another injury‚Ä¶HLR that was never a consideration for me. I trief, a law judge,....im not criticisinx g everybody but theres some people t VA who cant do their job and are biased on some things. I like to have as little to do with them as possible   
:29  
Board appeal decision, im all set, so i wouldnt file a claim, but you said‚Ä¶.as soon as i would do a board of appeal i would hire a lawyer

22. Is there **confusion or drop-off at the ‚Äútype of claim‚Äù question** in flow?   
    - [ ] Yes, the participant was confused about the ‚Äútype of claim‚Äù question.  
    - [x] No, the question was clear.

Note:


### Task 3: Select an option on the summary screen

‚Äú**You‚Äôve reached the summary screen.** Please take a minute to read through this page and talk out loud to describe what you are experiencing. Please don‚Äôt click any links yet, let me know when you are done and I will ask you some questions.‚Äù

#### Summary screen questions

23.  Was the Veteran able to reach the summary screen successfully and without help?  
- [x] Yes, the participant reached the summary screen successfully.  
- [ ] No, the participant didn‚Äôt reach the summary screen/needed assistance.

#### 

24. Is this screen what you **expected** to find? Why / why not?

Note: i would print these results :30

* No, but its pretty self explanatory  
* I dont know if it needs to be that long,   
* Just put print this page and they should understand that‚Ä¶.

25. Now that you have walked through the Guide, given the options presented to you, **which option would you choose** for your individual situation and why?

Note:  i would go right to appeals board, a supplemental claim you could put in, but you would have to‚Ä¶for starters supplemental would have to be something that was already service connected, if you were denied because it wasnt service connected, youd have a tough time, if it wasn‚Äôt in your records‚Ä¶.i really, did a lot of research on my own and that would be a hard one to do. If youre going to go through this process you need someone to navigate it for you

:32

Board appeal, \*\* did not scroll down to see that as a grey card

üìÑ*Notetaker: Copy and paste the rating options [from the Appendix](#bookmark=id.uwh6p4r5tfw3) into Zoom Chat for visual reference:*

26. On a scale of 1-4, how **confident are you in selecting that choice from the Summary Screen**?  
    - [ ] 1 \= Not at all confident  
          - [ ] 2 \= Slightly confident  
          - [ ] 3 \= Confident  
          - [ ] 4 \= Extremely confident

    Note: im much more with board appeal, of course‚Ä¶its a nice process. Youve got someone you can talk to, this is like wizard of oz, ig you forgotsomething youve fot the lawyer there who can‚Ä¶

    :34

    Right now, if i had been denied at the supplemental would not be what i would choose, because i want a person to talk to, this falls onto somebodys desk, you really dont know where it goes‚Ä¶a lot of that stuff i feel is more an opinion than factual, whereas going into the court its factual

    :36

    

27. **Has your review option changed** from what you originally expected?  And if so, what about the guide led you to reconsider your choice?

Note:


  
üëÄ Notetaker: 

28. Did the user select the **CFI & Disagree path/BOTH PATH**?    
- [ ] Yes

Note:


üëÄ Notetaker:  Is the participant **able to state one requirement of why/why not** on the summary screens?

- [ ] Yes, the participant was able to rephrase the summary screen requirements.  
      - [ ] No, the participant was not able to state a requirement of the summary screen.

31. Looking at these options, what do you think about their **order**? Does any option appear **higher-priority or more important** than the others, or do they all seem equal? Why?   
    (Perceived hierarchy on summary screens, What about when \>1 pathway?)

Note:


32. Now that you‚Äôve reviewed the summary screen, is there **any information missing**? Are you still looking for something that would help you choose your next step?

Note:


33. What would you do from here? What is the **next step** you might take?  
    - [ ] Restart  
    - [ ] Print  \- Ask: ‚ÄúIf you printed, what would you do with that information?‚Äù  
    - [ ] Bookmark \- Ask: ‚ÄúWhere would you expect the bookmark to take you?‚Äù  
    - [ ] Email the link \- Ask: ‚ÄúWhere would you expect the link to take you?‚Äù  
    - [ ] Save as PDF   
    - [ ] Other 

Note:


34. Does the wording and presentation of the options on the summary screen give you the **confidence to move forward** with your next step?

Note:  

35. At this point in the process, **do you believe you‚Äôve submitted** your Decision Review request at this stage, or do you think there are still steps left to complete it? What actions would you expect to take next to finish submitting?

      *üëÇ*  Note: Listen for confusion around ‚Äú**You‚Äôre requesting a review of‚Ä¶**‚Äù language in the summary screen.

Note:


36. Imagine you've reached the summary screen and you noticed **you answered a question incorrectly or changed your mind**. What would you do?

Note:  since they dont offer, maybe something you could put there‚Ä¶.put all your answers up here, you know like a check

I would do the back arrow if it let me 

Then reads breadcrumb, says I think that does go back

:37

37. If you could **change anything about the summary screen**, what might that be?

Note:


üìÑ*Notetaker:*

38. Do they have anything to say about the **cards** on the summary screen?

    - [ ] ‚ÄòAll option‚Äô cards

*üëÇ Notetaker: Listen for‚Ä¶‚ÄùI still don‚Äôt understand why X option is not for me‚Ä¶‚Äù or ‚Äúthis doesn‚Äôt tell me‚Ä¶‚Äù or ‚Äúthis page is missing‚Ä¶‚Äù*

### Overall Post Questions

46. What, if anything, was **burdensome or confusing** about the experience overall?

Note:  i believe in the 000 rule, and i like to keep it simple. Some of the statements are repetitive or not needed at all, what was in that first screen, there were several things in there‚Ä¶.

Okay on this page‚Ä¶‚Äùthis guide isn;t a form‚Ä¶well if it isnt a form you submit than why is it you‚Äôre dealing ‚Ä¶ :40 that paragraph and the one below it 

More work to be done, all it was was that you were going to open up that window 

Right at begging‚Ä¶claim decision review options (for title), say exactly what it is, if you dont know what the meaning of these words are‚Ä¶thats what was confusing, learning the vernacular, these are words that people wouldnt normally use‚Ä¶anything where there is al awuer involved, you need to double down so you understand it. :42

I like these questions here, yes or no, boom‚Ä¶ :43

I just personal put decision review options, you know its mine‚Ä¶

Like i said, if you have a full page, before the print you can do a proof check to make sure you answer what 

47. *ASK ONLY IF THEY HAD AN ANSWER AT THE BEGINNING*: At the beginning of the study, we asked if there was a decision review pathway you were considering pursuing. **Have your results of the guide impacted the option** you were considering?

Note:


### 

48. Would you **recommend this tool** to a friend? Why / why not? 

Note:  if they went through ‚Ä¶of they want to know it, normally i just recommend a lawyer because trying to do this on your own is impossible

49. How might/would you **use this tool in the future**?

Note:  well, it would keep things moving and i am big on keeping information, i want a ndate and time stamp, this gets me into the system because if you dont even start it, nothing happens 

50. Is this guide something you would use to **plan next steps**? To **start the process** of a decision review? Both?

Note:


51. Does the **name** ‚Äò*Explore disability claim decision review options*‚Äô communicate its purpose?

Note:  i dont think you need the explore part‚Ä¶:46

52. Did the guide feel like **too many questions, too few**, or **about right**? 

Note:  about right, you gotta get the basic information out. One think i think should happen with this, once you receive the information, they need to verify they have received it‚Ä¶if you are doing mail, :46

It falls in a big hole someplace, with their process of taking months and years with these things, you forget what you did. The process is way too long‚Ä¶most of this stuff should be cut and dry‚Ä¶you shouldnt have to be waiting months and months 

Us court of appeals box \- kyra question :49

Thats fine i understand, short and sweet this is is exactly what i did, court of appeals

Uh, when it says hlr, this is almost like them not giving you options‚Ä¶this is like im going to far, without‚Ä¶why is it needed 

Well board of appeal is an option for everyone if youve got new evidence or if you disagree with a decision‚Ä¶theyll put a reason on here‚Ä¶you would have to submit more information, now what i did, i went with a lawyer and the lawyer helped me get the info and they knew what info i needed to sway option in my decision

I think everyone can request‚Ä¶you couldnt just go right off the get go, you have to go through procedure‚Ä¶i think what they mean by this, before you go to the proces‚Ä¶you would fill out a form, put in your information‚Ä¶compensation pension test, medical doctor‚Ä¶disability evaluated, bering it back to a rating in the VA, and either ok it and give you a rating :53 no reason if youwerent in the system

If you had already been processed and given appeals is only if you 

Neither i guess , :56

Biancas question

The supplemental is if you got some information that you didnt have in initial claim, like you went through and found medical records and resubmitted it. You could submit it that way, i chose not to because i dont tryst some of the rating that come in behind that. It takes a long time to get through that to start with. I felt my chances of getting refused again were great, so i went straight to appeals. :58

Yes, when you get a decision letter, although the decision letter is sometimes condusing to, they tell you why you were denied‚Ä¶.not service connected, not severe enough to get into the system‚Ä¶you could do a supplemental for that and argue i suppose. You cant really argue, youre just gonna resubmit information, whereas if you go to appeals judge you can argue on the spot :59

53. What **types of claims** do you think this guide supports?  
    Note:  

### If additional time allows‚Ä¶

54. How does this guide compare to **how you previously learned about** or chose decision review options?

Note:

## **Section 4: Wrap up \- 5 minutes**

### Consent to use video clips

I want to circle back and ask one more question that we ask all participants about the video recording: **Is it okay with you if we share a video clip of part of this session with our VA partners?** We'd want to do this if we find a clip that demonstrates the need for an improvement or other helpful example of Veteran needs. We remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and would only share the video clips with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.

- [x] Yes  
      - [ ] No  
            

      **If yes:** Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip? Record answer here:  
            Note:  no,   
        
      ‚ÄúI hope you can make it a little simpler‚Äù  
      

### Thank you and closing

‚ÄúWe really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work to improve the website for Veterans.

Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day\!‚Äù

# Emergency Exit üÜó

## **Pause or exit strategies**

**If the participant can't screen share after troubleshooting**

I really appreciate your patience through this. I'm sure you know, it can be really frustrating when technology is not our friend. Since we're not able to set up screen share, we're going to end the session now. You're still going to be compensated for the full session. Thanks again for joining us and we'll hopefully see you back here again for another study.

**If the participant isn't feeling well**

I'm sorry you're \[not feeling well\]. Do you feel up for continuing? You'll be paid even if we stop early.  
If they choose to continue...  
Okay, just let me know if you change your mind.

**If the participant is showing signs of upset or distress**

This sounds so hard. Would you like to take a break or stop?  
If they choose to take a break and come back...  
Welcome back. I'm interested to hear more about \[topic you left off on\]. Are you up for continuing or would you prefer we move to the next topic?

**If the participant decides to stop**

Thank you for your time today, I completely understand your decision to stop.  
If they seem distressed...  
Before you go, the VA Hotline number is 988, it's a confidential helpline, and it's 24/7. It's up to you whether you call.

**If the participant is fine to continue, but you aren't**

I hear that you're okay to continue. Before we do, I realized that I need a minute. I'm going to turn off my camera and microphone, and get a glass of water. Is that okay with you? I'll be back in 3 minutes.

If you're still not able to continue, after you pause...  
Thanks for letting me take a break. You didn't do anything wrong, but I'm realizing that I'm not going to be able to continue this session. You will still be paid for the full time. I really appreciate you sharing with me today. Is it okay with you if we stop? Thanks very much.
