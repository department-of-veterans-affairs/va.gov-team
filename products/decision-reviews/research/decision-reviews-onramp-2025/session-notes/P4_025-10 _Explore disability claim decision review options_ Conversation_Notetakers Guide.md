 Notes for Notetaker

## **Section 1: Introduction \- 5-10 minutes**

Thank you so much for joining us today\! My name is **\[NAME\]** and I work at VA.gov to help improve access to benefits and services for Veterans like you. 

**\[NOTETAKER NAME\]** will be taking notes. I also have another colleague in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...

Today we're going to talk about choosing a decision review pathway. We‚Äôre working on an online guide to assist Veterans with exploring the review options available after a disability claim decision has been made. I‚Äôll walk you through the guide and ask for your honest feedback so we can improve it.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

* **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure to end on time, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

* **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your skills, knowledge, or abilities. We‚Äôre here to learn from your perspective, so please share your thoughts openly. All feedback is welcome.

* **Whenever you can, please talk out loud to share your thought process as you complete tasks.** This will help me understand your experience. I might remind you to think out loud because this can feel unnatural and be easy to forget.

* **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know. If you decide you need to stop at any time, you‚Äôll still be compensated for your time.

* **I want you to know that although I work on the VA.gov website, I have no access to your records or benefits, nor do I have the ability to change your claims or benefits in any way**. I am not a specialist in benefits. My primary focus is to understand your experience with the website.

* That was a lot of information. Are you okay with proceeding with the agenda I‚Äôve proposed for today‚Äôs session?

* The people from Perigean who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Is it okay with you to have  one person join us to observe this session?**

	**If no:** Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.

**If yes:** Admit observers.

* Then, ask the notetaker and observers to **give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov.** (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)  
  * Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth  
      
* **You'll be interacting with a prototype today.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas and links of the prototype will be functional, and some will not. **Since this is only a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.**


* **I‚Äôd like to ask your permission to record my screen and audio as we talk today.** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are deleted, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.

  * **Knowing that, is it okay with you if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**  
  * If yes,  ‚û°Ô∏è **Have the Notetaker start the recording.**  
    * **Reminder to Notetaker:** After you start the recording, select the ‚ÄúShow captions (CC)‚Äù button to enable transcription for the recording.  
* **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Is it okay with you if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

**Record answer here:**

### **Warm-up Questions**

‚ÄúBefore we look at the prototype, let‚Äôs start with a few warm-up questions.

1. Just to confirm, you mentioned during recruitment that you‚Äôve previously filed a disability compensation claim with the VA‚Äîis that correct?

Note:  yes ma‚Äô‚Äôam

2. How long ago was that \- when did you last file a VA benefits claim? 

Note:  done several over the years, the oldest is maybe 6 years ago and the most recent is in the past year

3. Have you received a decision for that claim?    
- [x] Yes  
- [ ] No

Note:


4. Have you ever challenged a VA claim decision or filed a VA decision review before?      
   - [x] Yes  
   - [ ] No

Note:


5. Which claim review option did you choose?   
- [ ] Supplemental Claim  
- [x] Higher-Level Review  
- [x] Board Appeal  
- [ ] US Court of Appeals  
- [ ] Motion to Vacate  
- [ ] Motion to Reconsider  
- [ ] CUE  
- [ ] Don‚Äôt know or remember

Note:  reviewed by a judge i think, and its been a few years ago so i may have forgotten‚Ä¶.i think i challenged one decision or more, and they may have been approved or disapproved‚Ä¶.but i have an 80% total compensation rating ‚Ä¶

:39

Got a decision from a judge, there was a hearing but i was not required to appear at a hearing‚Ä¶

6. Did you file the decision review yourself, or did you work with a VSO or an attorney on your behalf?  
   - [ ] Worked with a VSO/Attorney  
   - [x] Filed themselves  
* If they filed themselves: ‚ÄúCan you walk me through how you first learned about the different VA decision review options‚Äîand what factors helped you decide which one to choose?‚Äù

Note:  donea ll my filings myself, ive never used an attorney. I dont think ive used the va iself, i follow the instructions on the computer and prob. A few years ago ive written them by hand. The instructions are not terribly complication‚Ä¶

How did you learn about the decision review options?

Probably reading the material on the VAs site and the periodicals they mail like agent orange, i was placed on the agent orange publication list and  i learned that i was probably eligible‚Ä¶.

:41

7. Is there currently a decision review option that you are considering filing?  *(IF ANSWER NO, THEN SKIP \#47)*

Note:  i dont think so, the last one i filed was the one the judge looked at. And i think that once you do that, theres no appealing. And i believe his or her decision was final on that matter. 

I assume i was applying for several different disabilities, and one or moe wre approved and one or more were disapproved 

:43

üìÑ*Notetaker: Copy and paste the rating options [from the Appendix](#bookmark=id.jd076ikhrh1n) into Zoom Chat for visual reference:* 

8. On a scale of 1-4, where 1 is that you don‚Äôt understand the options at all and 4 is that you understand the options very well, how **well do you currently feel you understand the decision review options**, the requirements, and which one might apply to your situation?

   - [ ] 1: I don‚Äôt understand them at all  
   - [ ] 2: I understand them a little  
   - [x] 3: I understand them well   
   - [ ] 4: I understand them very well

Note:


## **Section 2: Work through their own situation \- 20-25 minutes**

### Set the Task

‚ÄúFor today‚Äôs session, imagine you‚Äôre on VA.gov, looking to ask VA to reconsider your disability benefits decision. You will be navigating through a guide to explore the review options available to you, to help you select the decision review option that fits your needs. The guide will ask a few high-level questions‚Äîno sensitive details‚Äîand anything you enter is for testing purposes only; none of the information you enter will impact your benefits in any way. If it‚Äôs okay with you, we‚Äôd like you to answer the questions today as if you were using this on your own- providing answers based on your own personal situation.‚Äù

**Caveat**: We‚Äôre interested in two things: how easy it is to use and does the way the information is presented support your decision making process. Some details haven‚Äôt yet been fully aligned with official VA policy, so please don‚Äôt rely on the information you see here to make decisions about your own situation.‚Äù

### Task 1: Launch the guide

**Navigate to the Intro screen.** ‚ÄúLet's get started. First, I am going to drop a link in the Zoom chat. When you receive the link, please open the web page.‚Äù

**Link**:   [https://staging.va.gov/decision-reviews/explore-disability-claim-decision-review-options](https://staging.va.gov/decision-reviews/explore-disability-claim-decision-review-options) 

‚ÄúNext, I‚Äôd like you to **share your window** for the remainder of the session. If you need help figuring out how to share your window I am happy to troubleshoot.‚Äù

**‚ÄúNow that you have had a chance to read through the introductory screen, please go ahead and start. Answer the questions true to your situation, to the best of your ability.**  I will mostly just observe you working through this process. If you can, please remember to talk out loud to share your thought process as you read through the guide to help me understand your experience.‚Äù

*üëÄ Notetaker:* Things to watch for

Observe the Veteran working through the questions as they correspond to their own situation.

* Any issues or confusion with any of the language or terms used?  
* Common errors observed from misunderstanding questions?  
* Are there points of tension, friction, or confusion as they work through the questions?

**If the user gets to question 2.0: ‚Äò*What type of claim decision is the one you want us to review?***‚Äô ask the following: 

21. Tell me in your own words **what you just chose** and why.

Note:  i think i did a supplemental claim for that one

22. Is there **confusion or drop-off at the ‚Äútype of claim‚Äù question** in flow?   
    - [ ] Yes, the participant was confused about the ‚Äútype of claim‚Äù question.  
    - [x] No, the question was clear.

Note:


### Task 3: Select an option on the summary screen

‚Äú**You‚Äôve reached the summary screen.** Please take a minute to read through this page and talk out loud to describe what you are experiencing. Please don‚Äôt click any links yet, let me know when you are done and I will ask you some questions.‚Äù

#### Summary screen questions

23.  Was the Veteran able to reach the summary screen successfully and without help?  
- [ ] Yes, the participant reached the summary screen successfully.  
- [ ] No, the participant didn‚Äôt reach the summary screen/needed assistance.

#### 

24. Is this screen what you **expected** to find? Why / why not?

Note: 

‚Äú i dont think i need to print the page‚Äù :06

Yes i think so, previous screen told me what the review options were and shows me what they are again and fine tunes it a bit‚Ä¶.

:07

I think supplemental claim is a good fit‚Ä¶i think ill start with supplemental claim

25. Now that you have walked through the Guide, given the options presented to you, **which option would you choose** for your individual situation and why?

Note:  I think supplemental claim is a good fit‚Ä¶i think ill start with supplemental claim, well i feel, ill try to be specific, my body aget vietnam, when i got home‚Ä¶1969, my wife noticed i had these cherry red bumps‚Ä¶.at that time i didnt even consider it might be something the VA would want to know about, so i did nothing about it for years‚Ä¶.we need to take a look at this, because they are still there, so i did another exam at the VA and they determined that these cherry red bumps were not service-connected, and i think one doctor who examined me‚Ä¶.but i was only 25 years old and today i still think these bumps were caused by agent orange  
:09

Im pretty sure i did a supplemental claim and eveni n the most recent one, which i think i did a board appeal, and maybe a HLR\< but again they did not approve them for ocmpoension‚Ä¶they did not find them service connection, but ill slways believe‚Ä¶but i think now since we did the board appeal, we did the last step in the appeal process, theres nothing more i can do about it

üìÑ*Notetaker: Copy and paste the rating options [from the Appendix](#bookmark=id.uwh6p4r5tfw3) into Zoom Chat for visual reference:*

26. On a scale of 1-4, how **confident are you in selecting that choice from the Summary Screen**?  
    - [ ] 1 \= Not at all confident  
          - [x] 2 \= Slightly confident  
          - [ ] 3 \= Very confident  
          - [ ] 4 \= Extremely confident

    Note: 

    

27. **Has your review option changed** from what you originally expected?  And if so, what about the guide led you to reconsider your choice?

Note:


  
üëÄ Notetaker: 

28. Did the user select the **CFI & Disagree path/BOTH PATH**?    
- [ ] Yes  
- [ ] No

Note:


29. Does the user understand that there are 2 steps to take (DR and a CFI Claim)?   
- [ ] Yes  
- [ ] No

Note:


30. On this summary screen, if you were explaining to a friend **why these options would or wouldn't fit**, how would you explain your options to them?

Note:


üëÄ Notetaker:  Is the participant **able to state one requirement of why/why not** on the summary screens?

- [ ] Yes, the participant was able to rephrase the summary screen requirements.  
      - [ ] No, the participant was not able to state a requirement of the summary screen.

31. Looking at these options, what do you think about their **order**? Does any option appear **higher-priority or more important** than the others, or do they all seem equal? Why?   
    (Perceived hierarchy on summary screens, What about when \>1 pathway?)

Note:  they are definitely not equal, supplemental would be first step, if that didnt work then another supplemental claiml, then HLR, then board appeal

:14 \*\*\*

32. Now that you‚Äôve reviewed the summary screen, is there **any information missing**? Are you still looking for something that would help you choose your next step?

Note:  could learn more, or you could start board appeal request and i dont think that would be appropriate for someone working on supplemental claim 

33. What would you do from here? What is the **next step** you might take?  
    - [ ] Restart  
    - [ ] Print  \- Ask: ‚ÄúIf you printed, what would you do with that information?‚Äù

    - [ ] Other 

Note:  fill out the form for the supplemental claim and send it to the VA, either do by post office mail or file on the computer‚Ä¶i dont know if there is another way. A supplemental claim on the computer is the same id you are looking at the hard copy itself‚Ä¶its more desirable by the VA and veterans because it produces results faster \*\*

:15

34. Does the wording and presentation of the options on the summary screen give you the **confidence to move forward** with your next step?

Note:  yes

35. At this point in the process, **do you believe you‚Äôve submitted** your Decision Review request at this stage, or do you think there are still steps left to complete it? What actions would you expect to take next to finish submitting?

Note:  may be sometimes they might contact me for more information or at a later date, or more evidence would show up which i would need to let the VA know about‚Ä¶its not a final thing‚Ä¶.

Im getting mixed up in what ive done and what id like to do :17 \*\*\*\*

üìÑ*Notetaker:* Does the participant understand that there is further action (beyond the guide) needed to submit a DR?

- [ ] Yes, the participant understands that further action is required.  
      - [ ] No, the participant believes DR has been submitted.

### 

48. Would you **recommend this tool** to a friend? Why / why not? 

Note:  yes, because its really not that hard but many veterans especially my age still dont use computers‚Ä¶and eben filling out forms they dont enjoy doing that or would need some help to get it done, i dont know if its the education or just the experience at my age and i have some slight training in computers, and i have a bachelors in‚Ä¶.and i managed a busines‚Ä¶and to me it seems a simple way to get it done and it takes an hour or less \*\*\*

:22

49. How might/would you **use this tool in the future**?

Note:  i dont know, i may have applied for everything thats available and i either success or failed, unless some evidence comes up or a new law‚Ä¶

When i did initial request sometimes they would immediately approve, if they disapprove, then i would say wait a minute‚Ä¶so i would look for a further review or more evidence or something 

I ass

## **Section 4: Wrap up \- 5 minutes**

### Consent to use video clips

I want to circle back and ask one more question that we ask all participants about the video recording: **Is it okay with you if we share a video clip of part of this session with our VA partners?** We'd want to do this if we find a clip that demonstrates the need for an improvement or other helpful example of Veteran needs. We remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and would only share the video clips with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.

- [x] Yes  
      - [ ] No  
            

      **If yes:** Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip? Record answer here:  
            Note:  not really, i try to tell the truth and hopefully it will help somebody  
      

### Thank you and closing

‚ÄúWe really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work to improve the website for Veterans.

Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day\!‚Äù

# Emergency Exit üÜó

## **Pause or exit strategies**

**If the participant can't screen share after troubleshooting**

I really appreciate your patience through this. I'm sure you know, it can be really frustrating when technology is not our friend. Since we're not able to set up screen share, we're going to end the session now. You're still going to be compensated for the full session. Thanks again for joining us and we'll hopefully see you back here again for another study.

**If the participant isn't feeling well**

I'm sorry you're \[not feeling well\]. Do you feel up for continuing? You'll be paid even if we stop early.  
If they choose to continue...  
Okay, just let me know if you change your mind.

**If the participant is showing signs of upset or distress**

This sounds so hard. Would you like to take a break or stop?  
If they choose to take a break and come back...  
Welcome back. I'm interested to hear more about \[topic you left off on\]. Are you up for continuing or would you prefer we move to the next topic?

**If the participant decides to stop**

Thank you for your time today, I completely understand your decision to stop.  
If they seem distressed...  
Before you go, the VA Hotline number is 988, it's a confidential helpline, and it's 24/7. It's up to you whether you call.

**If the participant is fine to continue, but you aren't**

I hear that you're okay to continue. Before we do, I realized that I need a minute. I'm going to turn off my camera and microphone, and get a glass of water. Is that okay with you? I'll be back in 3 minutes.

If you're still not able to continue, after you pause...  
Thanks for letting me take a break. You didn't do anything wrong, but I'm realizing that I'm not going to be able to continue this session. You will still be paid for the full time. I really appreciate you sharing with me today. Is it okay with you if we stop? Thanks very much.
