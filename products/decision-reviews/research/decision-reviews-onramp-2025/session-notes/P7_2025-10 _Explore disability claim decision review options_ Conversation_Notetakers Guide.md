**KEY**

 Notes for Notetaker

## **Section 1: Introduction \- 5-10 minutes**

Thank you so much for joining us today\! My name is **\[NAME\]** and I work at VA.gov to help improve access to benefits and services for Veterans like you. 

**\[NOTETAKER NAME\]** will be taking notes. I also have another colleague in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...

Today we're going to talk about choosing a decision review pathway. We‚Äôre working on an online guide to assist Veterans with exploring the review options available after a disability claim decision has been made. I‚Äôll walk you through the guide and ask for your honest feedback so we can improve it.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

* **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure to end on time, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

* **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your skills, knowledge, or abilities. We‚Äôre here to learn from your perspective, so please share your thoughts openly. All feedback is welcome.

* **Whenever you can, please talk out loud to share your thought process as you complete tasks.** This will help me understand your experience. I might remind you to think out loud because this can feel unnatural and be easy to forget.

* **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know. If you decide you need to stop at any time, you‚Äôll still be compensated for your time.

* **I want you to know that although I work on the VA.gov website, I have no access to your records or benefits, nor do I have the ability to change your claims or benefits in any way**. I am not a specialist in benefits. My primary focus is to understand your experience with the website.

* That was a lot of information. Are you okay with proceeding with the agenda I‚Äôve proposed for today‚Äôs session?

* The people from Perigean who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Is it okay with you to have  one person join us to observe this session?**

	**If no:** Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.

**If yes:** Admit observers.

* Then, ask the notetaker and observers to **give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov.** (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)  
  * Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth  
      
* **You'll be interacting with a prototype today.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas and links of the prototype will be functional, and some will not. **Since this is only a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.**


* **I‚Äôd like to ask your permission to record my screen and audio as we talk today.** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are deleted, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.

  * **Knowing that, is it okay with you if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**  
  * If yes,  ‚û°Ô∏è **Have the Notetaker start the recording.**  
    * **Reminder to Notetaker:** After you start the recording, select the ‚ÄúShow captions (CC)‚Äù button to enable transcription for the recording.  
* **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Is it okay with you if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

**Record answer here:**

Note:  SECOND SCENARIO

* Chooses supplemental claim on 2.0  
* Slightly different hti time because inside a year  
* Again, id go to supplemental claim first because that fits my situation first  
* I really like that you have the time frames, i think that is  helpful   
* In my scenario where i had new information that wasnt considered in the first claim, i think that best fits that, and i think the timeline   
  * It is  in my case, where i know i had the appropriate information in the first one, and i have heard of people going the Board appeal route and it taking years and year‚Ä¶  
    :10  
  * The timeframe, it jumps out at you, id go through that first just to avoid being tied up in the board appeal process   
* Tabs :12 \*\*\*  
* Very unlikely that i would print, go through process again  
  * No wouldnt expect to save information   
  * Um‚Ä¶i think at this point i would be okay with looksing it, only after supplemental claim having a bookmark‚Ä¶\*\*\*  
    :13

### 

### Set the Task

‚ÄúPlease do not select any links or leave the page yet.   

For today‚Äôs session, imagine you‚Äôre on VA.gov, looking to ask VA to reconsider your disability benefits decision. You will be navigating through a guide to explore the review options available to you, to help you select the decision review option that fits your needs. The guide will ask a few high-level questions‚Äîno sensitive details‚Äîand anything you enter is for testing purposes only; none of the information you enter will impact your benefits in any way. If it‚Äôs okay with you, we‚Äôd like you to answer the questions today as if you were using this on your own- providing answers based on your own personal situation.‚Äù

**Caveat**: We‚Äôre interested in two things: how easy it is to use and does the way the information is presented support your decision making process. Some details haven‚Äôt yet been fully aligned with official VA policy, so please don‚Äôt rely on the information you see here to make decisions about your own situation.‚Äù

#### Introduction Screen

‚Äú**Take some time to read through this screen.** When you‚Äôre ready, please talk to me about what you might expect to do before selecting any links. ‚Äù

Note:  just going through looking at what the options are to address the claim

First click would be responding to SOC or SSOC

#### Intro screen questions

9. In your own words, what do you think the ***Explore disability claim decision review options*** guide is for? What do you expect to get out of this guide?

Note:  i think this would be if i were to start searching if a claim was denied and i was looking for options available, and if iwere to click through a few options this is where i would end up 

10. What **types of claims** do you think this guide supports?

Note:  supplemental, higher level review, board appeal

11. What, if anything, would you like to **know *before* starting the guide**?

Note:  not sure

12. On the Intro page, under the bullets it says: *‚ÄòThis guide isn‚Äôt a form you‚Äôll submit to us.‚Äô*  **What does that mean** to you?

Note:  its not going to go anywhere

13. Is there anything on this page that is **confusing** or **unclear** that you would like to understand better?

Note:  no not on this page

14. What would you **select first** on this page and why?

Note:  see below

###### ‚û°Ô∏è If the Veteran selects the **helper text/accordion** links, ask:

15. Which accordions did they notice/open?

Note:  responding to soc or ssoc accordion, appears to read through the body text

:42

16. Was there any language or **wording** that caused hesitation or **confusion**?

Note:  statement of case and supplemental statement of case, im not super familiar with‚Ä¶thats why i clicked here. And i guess id be looking for an option of i have received a decision and what that next option would may be

Then click ‚Äúlooking for a decision review options for other VA benefits? 

Reads though, and this is where i would expect to find possible next steps :43

First click on supplemental claim, because i would be looking to provide addiitoinal documentation (link within looking accordion) \- clicks link and is reading through webpage

- Then clicks how do i file supplemental claim link on page and reads through. I just read through clickly and i would try to do supplemental claim online to see if it is something ican do on my own before going to a VSO‚Ä¶  
- :45

###### ‚û°Ô∏è If they click on any of the **links**, ask:

17. Was this information **helpful**?

Note:


18. Did this link help you **better understand** the question being asked in the guide?

Note:


19. Would you prefer links to **open a new tab** or **stay within the same window**?

Note:  i didnt notice but i would have expwected a separate tab, or this would be a separate tab to start the supplemental claim 

20. After viewing, where would you **expect to return**?

Note:  

### 

### \*\*\*

After Lauren redirect, clicks link on ‚Äúchoosing a decision review option‚Äù link in accordion- this is what expected to find, a little more information on the three routes

Explore options, i think that is well marked  
:47

### 

###  Task 2: Answer *Explore disability claim DR options* questions

**‚ÄúNow that you have had a chance to read through the introductory screen, please go ahead and start. Answer the questions true to your situation, to the best of your ability.**  I will mostly just observe you working through this process. If you can, please remember to talk out loud to share your thought process as you read through the guide to help me understand your experience.‚Äù

*üëÄ Notetaker:* Things to watch for

* Are there points of tension, friction, or confusion as they work through the questions?  
* Are there questions or considerations shared/reported?  
* Note which links the Veteran would select and note any comments they have about the information provided.

Note:

**If the user gets to question 2.0: ‚Äò*What type of claim decision is the one you want us to review?***‚Äô ask the following: 

21. Tell me in your own words **what you just chose** and why.

Note:  N/A

#### Summary screen questions

23.  Was the Veteran able to reach the summary screen successfully and without help?  
- [x] Yes, the participant reached the summary screen successfully.  
- [ ] No, the participant didn‚Äôt reach the summary screen/needed assistance.

#### 

24. Is this screen what you **expected** to find? Why / why not?

Note: this would be my best approach, and a place to start the claim

This is the answer i expected to find, and then an option to move forward on that

25. Now that you have walked through the Guide, given the options presented to you, **which option would you choose** for your individual situation and why?

Note:  supplemnental claim, because of my scenario, because additional information that wasn‚Äôt considered in my initial time. I havent seen that listed before with VA‚Ä¶but thress months sounds good, that would be a abeneift in deciding this one

:51

üìÑ*Notetaker: Copy and paste the rating options [from the Appendix](#bookmark=id.uwh6p4r5tfw3) into Zoom Chat for visual reference:*

27. **Has your review option changed** from what you originally expected?  And if so, what about the guide led you to reconsider your choice?

    (Perceived hierarchy on summary screens, What about when \>1 pathway?)

Note:  supplemental stands out, its definitely leading me to go this route

    - [ ] Email the link \- Ask: ‚ÄúWhere would you expect the link to take you?‚Äù  
    - [ ] Save as PDF   
    - [x] Other 

Note:  i would start the claim and at least see what that next page looks like and if i felt confident continuing on myself 

:53

\*\*\*

Note:  yes it does

Note:  i didnt find anything to be confusing in this process

53. What **types of claims** do you think this guide supports?  
    Note:  all three, supplemental HLR and board appeal

### If additional time allows‚Ä¶

54. How does this guide compare to **how you previously learned about** or chose decision review options?

Note:  much better than going through google and other website, its nice that its all here and easily available on the VA‚Äôs website 

:58

55. What **resources did you use before**, and how helpful were they compared to this guide?

Note:  google, when i googled this informaiton a couple yesar ago i felt like it directed me more toward VSOs and attorneys than geting this information muself

Note: more confident 

 

57. How much do you **trust the information provided in this guide**? What would make it more trustworthy?

In my experience, i had evidence that was outside of the VA healthcare system, that i new i had to bring in‚Ä¶how to get documents from one place to another

61. Do you have any **questions for us** about the *Explore disability claim decision review options* guide?

Note:  a great tool, i wish i had it in years past   
:01

Lauren;s question re: options link

I think it stands out on its own, go through this information first before hitting that‚Ä¶

Get to this page? 

Im not sure how id get to VA home, unless i would possibly searching for it‚Ä¶i think they do a good job n the information they send in the paper mailer, if this information was there on how to get to this page \*\*\*

:03

Search, appeals or denied decision 

Additional information, bullllet points on each claim \- maybe that could be thought of as a first step, order of operations or more in depth what is a supplemental vs higher level 

Looking for snapshot of the three options before starting 

62. Do the **observers** have any questions?

Note:


63. Do **you** have any final questions for us?

Note:


## **Section 4: Wrap up \- 5 minutes**

### Consent to use video clips

I want to circle back and ask one more question that we ask all participants about the video recording: **Is it okay with you if we share a video clip of part of this session with our VA partners?** We'd want to do this if we find a clip that demonstrates the need for an improvement or other helpful example of Veteran needs. We remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and would only share the video clips with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.

- [ ] Yes  
      - [ ] No  
            

      **If yes:** Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip? Record answer here:  
            Note:    
      

### Thank you and closing

‚ÄúWe really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work to improve the website for Veterans.

Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day\!‚Äù

# Emergency Exit üÜó

## **Pause or exit strategies**

**If the participant can't screen share after troubleshooting**

I really appreciate your patience through this. I'm sure you know, it can be really frustrating when technology is not our friend. Since we're not able to set up screen share, we're going to end the session now. You're still going to be compensated for the full session. Thanks again for joining us and we'll hopefully see you back here again for another study.

**If the participant isn't feeling well**

I'm sorry you're \[not feeling well\]. Do you feel up for continuing? You'll be paid even if we stop early.  
If they choose to continue...  
Okay, just let me know if you change your mind.

**If the participant is showing signs of upset or distress**

This sounds so hard. Would you like to take a break or stop?  
If they choose to take a break and come back...  
Welcome back. I'm interested to hear more about \[topic you left off on\]. Are you up for continuing or would you prefer we move to the next topic?

**If the participant decides to stop**

Thank you for your time today, I completely understand your decision to stop.  
If they seem distressed...  
Before you go, the VA Hotline number is 988, it's a confidential helpline, and it's 24/7. It's up to you whether you call.

**If the participant is fine to continue, but you aren't**

I hear that you're okay to continue. Before we do, I realized that I need a minute. I'm going to turn off my camera and microphone, and get a glass of water. Is that okay with you? I'll be back in 3 minutes.

If you're still not able to continue, after you pause...  
Thanks for letting me take a break. You didn't do anything wrong, but I'm realizing that I'm not going to be able to continue this session. You will still be paid for the full time. I really appreciate you sharing with me today. Is it okay with you if we stop? Thanks very much.
