 Notes for Notetaker

## **Section 1: Introduction \- 5-10 minutes**

Thank you so much for joining us today\! My name is **\[NAME\]** and I work at VA.gov to help improve access to benefits and services for Veterans like you. 

**\[NOTETAKER NAME\]** will be taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...

Today we're going to talk about choosing a decision review pathway. We‚Äôre working on an online guide to assist Veterans with exploring the review options available after a disability claim decision has been made. I‚Äôll walk you through the guide and ask for your honest feedback so we can improve it.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

* **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure to end on time, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

* **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your skills, knowledge, or abilities. We‚Äôre here to learn from your perspective, so please share your thoughts openly. All feedback is welcome.

* **Whenever you can, please talk out loud to share your thought process as you complete tasks.** This will help me understand your experience. I might remind you to think out loud because this can feel unnatural and be easy to forget.

* **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know. If you decide you need to stop at any time, you‚Äôll still be compensated for your time.

* **I want you to know that although I work on the VA.gov website, I have no access to your records or benefits, nor do I have the ability to change your claims or benefits in any way**. I am not a specialist in benefits. My primary focus is to understand your experience with the website.

* That was a lot of information. Are you okay with proceeding with the agenda I‚Äôve proposed for today‚Äôs session?

* The people from Perigean who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Is it okay with you to have  one person join us to observe this session?**

	**If no:** Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.

**If yes:** Admit observers.

* Then, ask the notetaker and observers to **give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov.** (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)  
  * Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth  
      
* **You'll be interacting with a prototype today.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas and links of the prototype will be functional, and some will not. **Since this is only a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.**


* **I‚Äôd like to ask your permission to record my screen and audio as we talk today.** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are deleted, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.

  * **Knowing that, is it okay with you if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**  
  * If yes,  ‚û°Ô∏è **Have the Notetaker start the recording.**  
    * **Reminder to Notetaker:** After you start the recording, select the ‚ÄúShow captions (CC)‚Äù button to enable transcription for the recording.  
* **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Is it okay with you if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

**Record answer here:**

Time :11

## **Section 2: Work through their own situation \- 20-25 minutes**

### Set the Task

‚ÄúFor today‚Äôs session, imagine you‚Äôre on VA.gov, looking to ask VA to reconsider your disability benefits decision. You will be navigating through a guide to explore the review options available to you, to help you select the decision review option that fits your needs. The guide will ask a few high-level questions‚Äîno sensitive details‚Äîand anything you enter is for testing purposes only; none of the information you enter will impact your benefits in any way. If it‚Äôs okay with you, we‚Äôd like you to answer the questions today as if you were using this on your own- providing answers based on your own personal situation.‚Äù

**Caveat**: We‚Äôre interested in two things: how easy it is to use and does the way the information is presented support your decision making process. Some details haven‚Äôt yet been fully aligned with official VA policy, so please don‚Äôt rely on the information you see here to make decisions about your own situation.‚Äù

### Task 1: Launch the guide

**Navigate to the Intro screen.** ‚ÄúLet's get started. First, I am going to drop a link in the Zoom chat. When you receive the link, please open the web page.‚Äù

**Link**:   [https://staging.va.gov/decision-reviews/explore-disability-claim-decision-review-options](https://staging.va.gov/decision-reviews/explore-disability-claim-decision-review-options) 

‚ÄúNext, I‚Äôd like you to **share your screen** for the remainder of the session. If you need help figuring out how to share your screen I am happy to troubleshoot.‚Äù

‚Äú**Take some time to read through this screen.** When you‚Äôre ready, please talk to me about what you might expect to do before selecting any links. Please do not select any links or leave the page yet ‚Äì but tell me verbally if there is an action you would like to take.‚Äù

#### Intro screen questions

9. In your own words, what do you think the ***Explore disability claim decision review options*** guide is for? What do you expect to get out of this guide?

Note:  I would expect. I need them to help me navigate. Okay, heres my situation, which of these apply to me. I would hope it uses plain language that I can understand‚Ä¶keep going, then i would expect‚Ä¶to be walked through to know which of these options would be the best for me

10. What **types of claims** do you think this guide supports?

Note:  Um, claims‚Ä¶not initial claims, but claims that have been denied

If i had read that closer‚Ä¶.compare‚Ä¶that would be a really good thing to see the comparison

11. What, if anything, would you like to **know *before* starting the guide**?

Note:  I don;t know what i dont know‚Ä¶i just want the guide to tell me the things. I am so clueless about it

12. On the Intro page, under the bullets it says: *‚ÄòThis guide isn‚Äôt a form you‚Äôll submit to us.‚Äô*  **What does that mean** to you?

Note:  this is just an informational king of thing, its not me filing, its not me taking action on any of these things

13. Is there anything on this page that is **confusing** or **unclear** that you would like to understand better?

Note:  no

14. What would you **select first** on this page and why?

Note:  I would expect to click explore your options, and i expect that would show me a decision chart thing‚Ä¶does this apply to you? Yes, do this. Does this other thing apply to you? Do this. Something like that

I would, let me see‚Ä¶.(reads options) i would click explore your options, that link, next to the green button

###### ‚û°Ô∏è If the Veteran selects the **helper text/accordion** links, ask:

15. Which accordions did they notice/open?

###  Task 2: Answer *Explore disability claim DR options* questions

**‚ÄúNow that you have had a chance to read through the introductory screen, please go ahead and start. Answer the questions true to your situation, to the best of your ability.**  I will mostly just observe you working through this process. If you can, please remember to talk out loud to share your thought process as you read through the guide to help me understand your experience.‚Äù

*üëÄ Notetaker:* Things to watch for

Observe the Veteran working through the questions as they correspond to their own situation.

* Any issues or confusion with any of the language or terms used?  
* Common errors observed from misunderstanding questions?  
* Are there points of tension, friction, or confusion as they work through the questions?  
* Are there questions or considerations shared/reported?  
* Note which links the Veteran would select and note any comments they have about the information provided.

Note:  

* ‚Äúcool it asks a simple yes or no‚Äù  
* Seems to pause at claim decided.  My claims were not all approved at the same time. Im not really sure, is it the last thing i got my decision on was dec. 2024\. And then to thicken the plot, i had some of those where i added a dependent, but i dont know if that counts as to what you are talking about‚Ä¶  
* 1.3: Thats a good thing to include, because im going to hem an d haw, but that is good, i didn;t receive a letter. And thats good you have a link. \*\*\*\*  
* Pause at [2.is](http://2.is).2 \- they are trying to see if i should file a supplemental claim, based on the title i think that‚Äôs what they are getting at  
* 2.0: i just said no to condition gotten worse, so it can‚Äôt be that‚Ä¶that would be inconsistent  
  * Confusion, re-reads. Oh, what type do you want to review‚Ä¶ive already [had.im](http://had.im) being silly \*\*\*  
* [2.is](http://2.is).1A: good, they are double checking to see if they are doing it based on a change it law, that makes me feel better about my decision (on previous screen)  
  * I went through all of that hullabaloo for nothing. Cause they reassured me‚Ä¶

**If the user gets to question 2.0: ‚Äò*What type of claim decision is the one you want us to review?***‚Äô ask the following: 

21. Tell me in your own words **what you just chose** and why.

Note:  for me i guess it would be, lets see i have some new evidence so, it would be supplemental

I chose supplemental claim because that seem to be the most applicable, i would be submitting new evidence, ‚Ä¶say i found a doctors note or something‚Ä¶i dont know almost like a new trial, because the other;s just didn;t apply‚Ä¶.now how is actually. This is a little confusing, because this is talking about things that already happened though, so actually that is not confusing. But my initial confusion is that, if i am submitting for an increase, well based on what, i have new information to support it but ‚Ä¶\*\*\*\* i guess the purpose matters. Im confused. This is why i used an attorney because i don‚Äôt understand this stuff. They seem kind of similar to me, i would assume i have to provide some new evidence‚Ä¶.claim for increase vs. supplemental claim. I dont know if initial claim or claim for increase should be together‚Ä¶.

:29-:31

22. Is there **confusion or drop-off at the ‚Äútype of claim‚Äù question** in flow?   
    - [x] Yes, the participant was confused about the ‚Äútype of claim‚Äù question.  
    - [ ] No, the question was clear.

Note:  see note above

I guess, i have to back up a little bit and understand whats happening here. Ive already been reviewed, and now i am wanting someone to review the reviewing. All this past tense, its something that already happened‚Ä¶.i do have an issue that didn;t get service connection, or did it get 0%. I dont know, lets say its 0% and i want to‚Ä¶

I don‚Äôt understand the different between claim for increase and supplemental claim. 

Im gonna go with claim for increase. This is definitely one of those things id have to explore, id see what you tell me at the end and go back and fix

:33

### Task 3: Select an option on the summary screen

‚Äú**You‚Äôve reached the summary screen.** Please take a minute to read through this page and talk out loud to describe what you are experiencing. Please don‚Äôt click any links yet, let me know when you are done and I will ask you some questions.‚Äù

#### Summary screen questions

23.  Was the Veteran able to reach the summary screen successfully and without help?  
- [x] Yes, the participant reached the summary screen successfully.  
- [ ] No, the participant didn‚Äôt reach the summary screen/needed assistance.  
* Note:   
  \-gives a time frame, thats good, and a link to do the thing that they are talking about.   
* They double check your answers  
* Goodness a year and a half, why is that so different. 3 months vs. a year and a half. I guess its cause its a board‚Ä¶who wants to do that?  
* Those looks to be the same (evidence & hearin) they are the same, but there is a 6 month difference in the timeframe goal.  
* So, this timeframe goal, should that be taken as‚Ä¶.i don‚Äôt know. Im going to see  
* Interesting, so supplemental claim says average time to receive a decision and then board says timeframe goal, ‚Ä¶i like the average time because \*\*\* shrug, we dont know \*\*\*good quote  
* I am curious too, it takes a lot longer, but why would someone choose that, is there a more favorable outcome \*\*\*  
* Theres another one? Board appeal direct review?  
24. Is this screen what you **expected** to find? Why / why not?

Note: Yes, why, because it did give me the why this ia a good fit, it ga me a means to go and do the things they said, and it gives me a side by side, these are your options 

an d i like as a bonus that it also gave me a look at the prizes you didnt choose, but they dont work for you because‚Ä¶and they give you a link to learn more about those if you wanted to

:40 \*\*\*

25. Now that you have walked through the Guide, given the options presented to you, **which option would you choose** for your individual situation and why?

Note:  supplemental claim, because it is the shortest turnaround time

I guess‚Ä¶why would anyone choose it, can you go to the board appeal options if the supplemental claim are denited? I guess‚Ä¶you havae to take it up the chain and it takes longer \*\*\*\* :41. I would be curious as to the hierarchy, or i guess the progression of ‚Ä¶you can do this first. You cant go to board appeal back to supplemental claim. 

üìÑ*Notetaker: Copy and paste the rating options [from the Appendix](#bookmark=id.uwh6p4r5tfw3) into Zoom Chat for visual reference:*

26. On a scale of 1-4, how **confident are you in selecting that choice from the Summary Screen**?  
    - [ ] 1 \= Not at all confident  
          - [ ] 2 \= Slightly confident  
          - [ ] 3 \= Very confident  
          - [x] 4 \= Extremely confident

    Note: just because, i think that avg time to receive a decision seems like the straightforward..i think this must be what may be what everyone does. And its also the simplest name ‚Äúsupplemental claim‚Äù not ‚Äúboard appeal‚Äù i dont know \*\*

    

27. **Has your review option changed** from what you originally expected?  And if so, what about the guide led you to reconsider your choice?

Note:  

Oh, im trying to remember what i picked originally‚Ä¶i think i seesawed on that first option.

\*\* thinking back to her selection on 2.0, not her perception foing in\*\*

üëÄ Notetaker: 

28. Did the user select the **CFI & Disagree path/BOTH PATH**?    
- [ ] Yes  
- [x] No

Note:


29. Does the user understand that there are 2 steps to take (DR and a CFI Claim)?   
- [ ] Yes  
- [ ] No

Note:  n/a

30. On this summary screen, would you describe how you‚Äôd explain to a friend **why these option(s) do or don‚Äôt fit**.

Note:  id use this same language, you are requesting ar eview of initial claim, you have new evidence. Its not being contested‚Ä¶i think its in plain enough language that i can just read it off the screen basically. 

üëÄ Notetaker:  Is the participant **able to state one requirement of why/why not** on the summary screens?

- [x] Yes, the participant was able to rephrase the summary screen requirements.  
      - [ ] No, the participant was not able to state a requirement of the summary screen.

31. Looking at these options, what do you think about their **order**? Does any option appear **higher-priority or more important** than the others, or do they all seem equal? Why?   
    (Perceived hierarchy on summary screens, What about when \>1 pathway?)

Note:  i mean they seem to be listed in time to receive the decision because you have got 3 months to 2 years. Almost like they want you to go with (suppl) because seems to be the way themost people go. They seem to be efficient at doing it if it only takes 3m months vs 2 years.

32. Now that you‚Äôve reviewed the summary screen, is there **any information missing**? Are you still looking for something that would help you choose your next step?

Note:  i mean theres a link, i dont knw what it explains, but it may say if you do one you cant go back to another‚Ä¶i would expect that is something i woud like to know before i do one r another :45 \*\*\*

33. What would you do from here? What is the **next step** you might take?  
    - [ ] Restart  
    - [ ] Print  \- Ask: ‚ÄúIf you printed, what would you do with that information?‚Äù  
    - [ ] Bookmark \- Ask: ‚ÄúWhere would you expect the bookmark to take you?‚Äù  
    - [ ] Email the link \- Ask: ‚ÄúWhere would you expect the link to take you?‚Äù  
    - [ ] Save as PDF   
    - [x] Other 

Note:  i would look at this learn more about supplemental claims tab before i started my claim, but once i was satisfied with the ‚Ä¶i would click the link \*\*\*

34. Does the wording and presentation of the options on the summary screen give you the **confidence to move forward** with your next step?

Note:  yes, i wanna say yes, but ‚Ä¶im splitting hairs here‚Ä¶.i guess its all board appeal and i assume you would check a box when you get there‚Ä¶since there is only one link that says start board appeal request

35. At this point in the process, **do you believe you‚Äôve submitted** your Decision Review request at this stage, or do you think there are still steps left to complete it? What actions would you expect to take next to finish submitting?

Note:  no, i have not

üìÑ*Notetaker:* Does the participant understand that there is further action (beyond the guide) needed to submit a DR?

- [x] Yes, the participant understands that further action is required.  
      - [ ] No, the participant believes DR has been submitted.

      *üëÇ*  Note: Listen for confusion around ‚Äú**You‚Äôre requesting a review of‚Ä¶**‚Äù language in the summary screen.

Note:  id click this start supplemental claim link

36. Imagine you've reached the summary screen and you noticed **you answered a question incorrectly or changed your mind**. What would you do?

Note:  i thought i saw a thing‚Ä¶restart the guide, oh but then id have to restart all the way‚Ä¶i guess id have to restart. 

There really werent that many questions so its not that big of a deal‚Ä¶.you know with longer forms you could go back to the specific thing‚Ä¶but that doesnt really apply to this, but its not a big deal 

:48

37. If you could **change anything about the summary screen**, what might that be?

Note:  nothing, i think its all, this is all VA speak‚Ä¶its the typical screen i see on the website 

üìÑ*Notetaker:*

38. Do they have anything to say about the **cards** on the summary screen?  
    - [ ] Available options cards  
    - [ ] ‚ÄòAll option‚Äô cards

*üëÇ Notetaker: Listen for‚Ä¶‚ÄùI still don‚Äôt understand why X option is not for me‚Ä¶‚Äù or ‚Äúthis doesn‚Äôt tell me‚Ä¶‚Äù or ‚Äúthis page is missing‚Ä¶‚Äù*

Note:

    - [x] 2 \= Understand a little  
    - [ ] 3 \= Understand well  
    - [ ] 4 \= Understand very well

Note:  just cause there all things i dont exactly know that im concerned about, if i do one, am i stuck, is that final? Before i tell something else‚Ä¶well what else though, what is the downside of choosing one or anotehr‚Ä¶maybe its on those links \*\*  
:50 

***\*\*\*goes back and changes \- id have to do more research, i probably would have hit up reddit or facebook groups, what are potential downsides‚Ä¶.*** :51

40. On a scale of 1-4, how **confident are you in selecting a decision review option** from the summary screen?  
    - [ ] 1 \= Not at all confident

    - [ ] 3 \= Confident  
    - [ ] 4 \= Very confident

Note:  at least before i was not at all, and now im up to a 2\!

41. Using this 1‚Äì4 scale where 1 is ‚ÄòVery judgmental‚Äô and 4 is ‚ÄòVery supportive‚Äô, how would you rate the **wording, tone, and presentation** of the summary screen?

    - [ ] 2 \= Somewhat judgemental  
    - [ ] 3 \= Somewhat supportive  
    - [x] 4 \= Very Supportive

Note:  i mean, i didnt really think about it. Lets see‚Ä¶very supportive. Very straightforward, doesnt seem to bebiased at all. I dont feel bad for asking or a review for anytihngn. I dont hink the wording is making me feel bad.

### Overall Post Questions

46. What, if anything, was **burdensome or confusing** about the experience overall?

Note:  

Not knowing the difference up front between a claim for increase vs. supplemebntal claim. They asked the questions after the fact‚Ä¶maybe if they 

I found it confusinf initial claim vs, claim for increase. I dont know the difference and that did not help me know the difference either 

:56

47. At the beginning of the study, we asked if there was a decision review pathway you were considering pursuing. **Have your results of the guide impacted the option** you were considering?

Note:  no, not for my situation

###

## **Section 4: Wrap up \- 5 minutes**

### Consent to use video clips

I want to circle back and ask one more question that we ask all participants about the video recording: **Is it okay with you if we share a video clip of part of this session with our VA partners?** We'd want to do this if we find a clip that demonstrates the need for an improvement or other helpful example of Veteran needs. We remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and would only share the video clips with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.

- [x] Yes  
      - [ ] No  
            

      **If yes:** Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip? Record answer here:  
            Note:  no  
      

### Thank you and closing

‚ÄúWe really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work to improve the website for Veterans.

Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day\!‚Äù

# Emergency Exit üÜó

## **Pause or exit strategies**

**If the participant can't screen share after troubleshooting**

I really appreciate your patience through this. I'm sure you know, it can be really frustrating when technology is not our friend. Since we're not able to set up screen share, we're going to end the session now. You're still going to be compensated for the full session. Thanks again for joining us and we'll hopefully see you back here again for another study.

**If the participant isn't feeling well**

I'm sorry you're \[not feeling well\]. Do you feel up for continuing? You'll be paid even if we stop early.  
If they choose to continue...  
Okay, just let me know if you change your mind.

**If the participant is showing signs of upset or distress**

This sounds so hard. Would you like to take a break or stop?  
If they choose to take a break and come back...  
Welcome back. I'm interested to hear more about \[topic you left off on\]. Are you up for continuing or would you prefer we move to the next topic?

**If the participant decides to stop**

Thank you for your time today, I completely understand your decision to stop.  
If they seem distressed...  
Before you go, the VA Hotline number is 988, it's a confidential helpline, and it's 24/7. It's up to you whether you call.

**If the participant is fine to continue, but you aren't**

I hear that you're okay to continue. Before we do, I realized that I need a minute. I'm going to turn off my camera and microphone, and get a glass of water. Is that okay with you? I'll be back in 3 minutes.

If you're still not able to continue, after you pause...  
Thanks for letting me take a break. You didn't do anything wrong, but I'm realizing that I'm not going to be able to continue this session. You will still be paid for the full time. I really appreciate you sharing with me today. Is it okay with you if we stop? Thanks very much.
