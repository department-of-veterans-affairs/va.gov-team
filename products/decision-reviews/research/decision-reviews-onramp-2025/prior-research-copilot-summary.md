- **User Voices & Usability:**
  - Veterans express difficulty in accessing and understanding pathway information, often relying on VSOs for help. Some appreciated the detailed info on VA.gov, but struggled with relevance and accessibility ([2022-11 Research Findings, P33](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/5ecb8e1980e2d2abe339027bc6304c733e5295a0/products/claim-appeal-status/research/2022-11-Decision-Reviews/research-findings.md#L88-L88)).

## 2. Key Outcomes, Challenges, and Gaps

### Outcomes & Insights

- **Friction Points:**  
  - Veterans struggle to identify the right pathway due to complex, lengthy processes and difficulty distinguishing between options ([Strategy Background](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/5ecb8e1980e2d2abe339027bc6304c733e5295a0/products/decision-reviews/research/decision-reviews-onramp-2025/research-strategy.md#L10-L14)).
  - Confusion around eligibility, timing, and evidence requirements is common and leads to delays or unfavorable outcomes ([DR Onramp Initiative Brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/5ecb8e1980e2d2abe339027bc6304c733e5295a0/products/decision-reviews/Enhanced-DR-Onramp-Initiative%20Brief.md#L14-L18)).

- **Veteran Needs:**  
  - Many Veterans want human support (VSOs) but not all can access it. Thereâ€™s a desire for clear, tailored, actionable guidance online ([Research Findings, P33](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/5ecb8e1980e2d2abe339027bc6304c733e5295a0/products/claim-appeal-status/research/2022-11-Decision-Reviews/research-findings.md#L88-L88)).

### Gaps

- **Resource Navigation:**  
  - Veterans often do not know which resources to trust or where to look for pathway selection guidance.
  - Static, siloed content on VA.gov can increase confusion ([Product Line Overview, Phase 2](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/5ecb8e1980e2d2abe339027bc6304c733e5295a0/products/decision-reviews/product/dr_product_line_overview_DRAFT.md#L193-L196)).

- **Data Integration:**  
  - Opportunities exist to leverage existing data (e.g., CorpDB, Caseflow) to better guide eligibility and reduce duplicate submissions ([Product Line Overview, Value Proposition](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/5ecb8e1980e2d2abe339027bc6304c733e5295a0/products/decision-reviews/product/dr_product_line_overview_DRAFT.md#L220-L224)).

## 3. Relevant Standards, Guidelines, and Practices

- **Guided Decision Review Process:**  
  - Iterative design and usability testing recommended (moderated/unmoderated, A/B tests, feedback surveys) to validate hypotheses and improve the guided experience ([Research Strategy Methods](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/5ecb8e1980e2d2abe339027bc6304c733e5295a0/products/decision-reviews/research/decision-reviews-onramp-2025/research-strategy.md#L65-L80)).
  - User journey mapping and friction identification are foundational ([Claim-Appeal Status Research Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/5ecb8e1980e2d2abe339027bc6304c733e5295a0/products/claim-appeal-status/research/2022-11-Decision-Reviews/research-strategy.md#L23-L31)).

- **User-Centered Design:**  
  - Testing multiple formats (decision trees, single-page, resource comparisons) to reduce cognitive load and improve confidence ([Product Line Overview](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/5ecb8e1980e2d2abe339027bc6304c733e5295a0/products/decision-reviews/product/dr_product_line_overview_DRAFT.md#L193-L196)).

## 4. Areas Where Additional Research or Input is Needed

- **Open Questions:**
  - How do Veterans actually choose a pathway, and what resources do they use or trust? ([Claim-Appeal Status Research Strategy](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/5ecb8e1980e2d2abe339027bc6304c733e5295a0/products/claim-appeal-status/research/2022-11-Decision-Reviews/research-strategy.md#L54-L58))
  - Should the platform encourage Veterans to seek VSO support, and if so, how?
  - What technical integrations (e.g., CorpDB, Caseflow) can streamline eligibility checks and reduce errors/delays?
  - What additional resources or support would help Veterans who have limited digital or VSO access?

- **Usability and Trust:**  
  - Deeper exploration is needed on how to build trust and reduce cognitive burden with digital guidance tools.
  - Further A/B and usability testing should be conducted as new features are introduced.

## Recommendations for Next Steps

- Review and synthesize the main [research strategy](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/5ecb8e1980e2d2abe339027bc6304c733e5295a0/products/decision-reviews/research/decision-reviews-onramp-2025/research-strategy.md) and [findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/a04237e74934fc8c62e3086c8c5a8d6393ce36bc/products/claim-appeal-status/research/2022-11-Decision-Reviews/research-findings.md) documents.
- Explore Mural artifacts for brainstorming and validation.
- Consider the open questions as prompts for additional Veteran interviews or usability testing.
- Prioritize integrating real eligibility data and personalized guidance into the digital experience.
