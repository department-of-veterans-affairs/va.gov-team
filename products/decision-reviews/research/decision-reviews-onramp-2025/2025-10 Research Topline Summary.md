This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.

The goal of this document is:

* To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data  
* To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## **Initial Findings**

**Finding 1: Starting the guide was not intuitive**

* Many users didn’t see or could not find the “Explore your options” link at the start of the guide.  
* The accordions at the bottom of the Introductory page drew visual focus which distracted from the main purpose \- to start the guide.  
* Some users wanted to learn more before starting; others came to the Explore Your Options Introductory page thinking they had to “already know” what to select.  
* Clearer text about what the guide does (e.g., 'help you decide among 3 decision review options') might help clarify the guide’s purpose.

**Finding 2: Confusion around claim references and VA terminology**

* Question 1.2 (“Was your claim decided less than a year ago?”) was confusing for those with older or multiple claims.  
* Question 2.0 (“What type of decision do you want us to review?”) was often misunderstood as asking what they want to pursue moving forward, rather than referring to the type of previous claim they’d submitted.  
* Users struggled to distinguish between ‘initial claim,’ ‘supplemental claim,’ and ‘claim for increase.’  
* Some users assumed Board Appeal was the ‘final step,’ reinforcing a sense of hierarchy instead of flexible pathways.

**Finding 3: Language and content clarity need improvement**

* Users preferred plainer, conversational language throughout the tool.  
* Phrases like: 'disagree with a decision' or 'claim decided less than a year ago' were confusing for those with multiple claims.  
* Users appreciated inclusion of timeframes and clear explanations of options.

**Finding 4: Varying mental models, trust in information, desire for human guidance**

* There’s a prevailing perception of a 'hierarchy' or order of operations among Decision Review pathways.  
* Some users who already understood the Decision Review process might not rely on or trust the guide’s recommendations.  
* Some users expressed skepticism toward official tools and preferred advice from attorneys or community peers.  
* Users valued reassurance and the ability to talk with a person if still unsure after using the guide; several users mentioned they would call the VA hotline, contact a VSO, or talk to friends before deciding.

**Finding 5: Positive reactions to tool interaction and design**

* Users appreciated the yes/no question format, felt the guide was the appropriate length, and felt confident answering the questions.  
* Some users moved quickly through questions or skipped content, while others read more closely.  
* Older users preferred printable results; younger users did not express that need.  
* A few users expressed confusion around form submission, but most understood that completing the guide would lead to next steps for submitting their Decision Review request.  
* Most users would pursue options from the “may be a good fit” section.
