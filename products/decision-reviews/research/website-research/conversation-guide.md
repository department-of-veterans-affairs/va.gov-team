## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Kevin] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the appeals process on VA.gov. Specifically, we're going to be looking at the process called Decision Reviews. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. In reality, we're testing ourselves. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

- **During our session today, you'll be interacting with the va.gov website.** Since we won't be asking you to log in to anywhere on the website, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?**

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - (5-10 minutes)

Before we look at the VA website, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Tell me a little about yourself. (Where do you live? Which branch of service? What do you do for work?)

- Have you ever filed a disability claim with the Department of Veteran Affairs?
    - How did you file it (online, mail, fax, VSO)?
    - What type of claim did you file? What was the benefit?
    - How did you feel about the process?
    
- Have you ever filed an appeal with the Department of Veteran Affairs?
    - How did you go about filing it?
    - How did you feel about the process?

## Setup Task: Share your screen with Zoom - (5 minutes)

- Please minimize or close any windows that you don't want to share with us.
- Navigate to va.gov in your computer's browser. 
- Click the "Share" button on Zoom.

## First Task: Let's pretend that your claim we discussed earlier was denied and you want to dispute that decision. Show us how you would do that.

- Start on the home page of VA.gov.

### Things to watch for:

- What path does the participant take to file an appeal?
- Does the participant realize that they cannot file an appeal on VA.gov?
- What keywords and phrases does the partipant look for?
- What painpoints do they encounter?
- What works well?
- Do they understand that they have to click the link on the banner to get to the Decision Review page?
- How many assists does it take for someone to land on that Decision Review page?

**be sure to assist the user in making it to the Decision Review page, if they haven't landed there already.**

## Second Task: Now that you're on this page (decision review landing page), what might you do next?

**Go ahead and take a few moments to take a look at this page and determine how you might proceed.**    

- What options are available to you here?
- Are there any terms on this page that confuse you or are unclear?


## If you wanted to dispute the decision for your aforementioned claim, Which of these options (lanes) would you choose and why?  

**Go ahead and take a few minutes to take a look at this page and determine which option you might choose and why - remember to think aloud as you look through the page.**

- What are the key points of information that helped you make the decision to choose this particular option?
- What information could've made this process faster or clearer?

## Now that you've chosen this option, what would you do next to move forward?

### Things to watch for:

- What path does the user take from here?
- What information guides the user through the rest of the process?
- How does the user scan the page? 
  - What parts of the page are they looking at?
  - How are they consuming the content? Are they scrolling up and down the page repeatedly?
