#  Introduction
(About 5 minutes)

Thank you for joining us today! My name is [CAROLA, I am a user experience designer for the VA] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about your experience appealing benefit claims with the VA.
Before we start, I want to mention a few things:

- This entire session should take about 45 minutes I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. So please let us know what you think, and any ideas on how we can improve this process for you. We are not testing your abilities. We just want to improve the Appeals Form process to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.

#  Other questions (Present when and as pertinent to the conversation)
(About 2 minutes each)

- We’ve shown you two forms. The first lets you appeal your decision to the Board of Veterans Appeals. The second form lets you appeal your decision to a more senior reviewer in the same office. If we asked you to fill one of them out, what would you want to know? How would you decide which form to use for the review you need? How do you know what you’re eligible for? What tools or documentation do you need to make the best decision?

- Are you currently using any VA websites to find out about services? 
va.gov, MyHealthEVet, and eBenefits 
// What services? Do you go there to find forms? Do you upload any document to these4 sites? Would these documents be helpful when filling out Review forms? //

- Would you preferer to fill out appeal forms online? Why? Why not? Would it be a better process for you? Why? Why not? 

- If you filled out Appeal review forms online, what information would you need available to fill out the form accurately? Or to make the process easier for you?
