## Background and Context

The Decision Reviews team conducted a broad search of key themes and top Veteran pain points across 2 sources: Call Center and Medallia data. Call Center data is qualitative free-form text; the input coming from Call Center representative notes based on incoming calls with Veterans. Medallia is quantitative data which comes from Veterans answering surveys in various places on [VA.gov](http://VA.gov). We leveraged traceable parsing tools to produce a high-level overview of areas of top concern for Veterans. This will give us the ability to prioritize key focuses of improvement, as well as identifying areas for future more in-depth research. 

### Key moments this supports in the Veteran's journey:

Analyzing data from both the Call Center and Medallia survey feedback touches on many aspects of the Veterans journey, however these are the most relevant:

* The “*Taking care of myself*” stage, specifically the “Managing primary care and chronic health issues” phase.  
* The “*Putting down roots*” stage, specifically the “Engaging VA to access benefits and services” phase.  
* And the “*Retiring*” stage, specifically within the “Finding additional sources of incomes”  and “Taking care of myself” phase.

## Research Goals

The scope of this research included the Call Center logs and Medallia feedback data from March 2024 to October 2025\. 

### Primary Outcome To Achieve:

* Understand top user pain points to generate concepts for future work

### Additional Outcomes: 

* Improve Veteran confidence with better online claim transparency  
  * Enable Veterans to easily find, view, and understand claim status, next steps, and timelines, without needing to call.  
  * Reduce uncertainty by ensuring clear and timely updates and confirmations at every stage.  
  * Increase trust that submissions, evidence, and appeals have been received, processed, and reviewed correctly.  
* Reduce delays and attempt to prevent avoidable issues  
  * Identify where process breakdowns, handoffs, or system constraints create unnecessary delays.  
  * Reduce errors that cause resubmissions or misrouted forms, where possible.  
  * Prevent delays by offering visibility and transparency, before Veterans escalate to Call Centers.  
  * Better understand how system, form, or process issues contribute to:  
    * Incorrect effective dates and intent to file dates  
    * Misclassified appeal types  
    * Incorrect forms submitted  
    * Delays in processing  
* Make the online filing, evidence submission, and appeals processes more reliable  
  * Enable users to successfully submit forms and evidence regardless of device, location (international), length of response, or type of file (PDF, JPG, etc).  
  * Allow users to clearly express disagreements, context, and evidence supporting their claims or appeals.  
  * Make easy to view post-submission activity, validating what’s been done, and allow for post-submission additions to reduce user anxiety.  
  * Find and fix technical blockers that prevent online task completion.  
* Clarify VA processes and reduce complexity and cognitive burden  
  * Help Veterans know which form to use, what to do, and when to submit documentation, without assistance.  
  * Verify that online guidance matches the paper processes and workflows.  
  * Reduce confusion caused by lengthy webpages, terminology, VA vernacular, or navigation.   
* Reduce user’s dependence on Call Centers and external help/attorneys  
  * Identify which pain points most commonly drive Veterans to seek:  
    * Call Center support  
    * VSOs or legal assistance  
  * Enable more users to be successful with their own self-service, while providing access to human help, when needed.

## Research Methodology

**Method:** Desk research / Review of existing data

This audit synthesizes findings from 4 Call Center data pulls and 2 Medallia data pulls conducted between March 2024 and October 2025, compiled into the following spreadsheets:

**Call Center:**

### Engineering Methodology

ENG leveraged an AI-generated script using [keywords (Slack)](https://dsva.slack.com/docs/T03FECE8V/F09NLN0PHKN) to parse more than 400,000 lines of data and generated spreadsheets of relevant data.

### UX Methodology

UX then reviewed and cross-checked the AI-generated spreadsheets, then manually validated findings by reviewing and identifying matching and supporting quotes. We used an [AI Script (Mural)](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1764865611148/cc0fad9824e217588ffae479f660eeb23f98da0e?wid=0-1765295289517) (based on the [one used by CST (Slack)](https://dsva.slack.com/docs/T03FECE8V/F09UM2HFC2U)) to help us assess which findings were most relevant to our team and identified insights that could be shared with other teams. This work resulted in lists of Top Pain Points listed in order of frequency. We synthesized this data (2 Medallia and 4 Call Center spreadsheets) to come up with similar categories and reoccurring themes. We used the percentage of frequency to rank issues across both.

## Key Findings

There is some crossover between Call Center and Medallia data, with both showing similar issues: poor claim status visibility, technical failures, document handling issues, unclear guidance, and appeal workflow breakdowns. Call Center data tends to emphasize the outcomes and frustrations from the perspective of the Veteran, as reported to Call Center representatives, whereas Medallia data emphasizes the root causes in the digital systems \- both UX and system behavior. Call Center data captures the downstream impact on Veterans, while Medallia data provides a more detailed insight into why these problems might occur. Some of these issues are within the scope of the Decision Reviews Team, while others are the responsibilities of other teams and considered Out Of Scope (OOS).

| Need for help completing filings | Support/assistance with filing (VSOs, attorneys) | Low find-ability, unclear starting points, complex multi-step flows/forms | DR & OOS |

### Additional Insights

#### Issues Mostly Unique to Call Center Data

These show up little or not at all in Medallia:

* C\&P exam quality concerns (rushed, biased, missed, inaccurate exams)  
* Incorrect effective dates/missing retroactive pay  
* Discrimination or retaliation allegations  
* Veteran’s intent to seek human assistance (VSOs, attorneys)

#### Issues Mostly Unique to Medallia Data

These are issues not commonly found in Call Center data:

* File type restrictions (PDF-only, JPG and images blocked)  
* Character limits that prevent longer detailed explanations  
* International phone numbers/addresses not supported  
* Submission confirmation date issues  
* Automated form misclassification (QuickSubmit errors \- OOS)

  * Character limits

* Prioritize Onramp tool launch to support ease of Appeal process to support Veteran frustration with:  
  * Denials of claims  
  * Denials of appeals  
  * Appealing incorrect effective dates  
  * Disagreement with ratings  
  * DR process understanding

* Conduct ENG Spikes for further investigation on:

We filtered for only responses that had a response in "why did you..." and omitted lines of data that did not have responses. This created a second Medallia data set for further tagging to look into. 

**Note**: We scanned all data for mentions of “hearing” specifically within Board Appeals. The Engineering Team was able to omit any row where ‘hearing’ \= ‘audiology’ (eg: audiologist, hearing aid(s), hearing impaired, hearing the agent, hard of hearing, hearing caller, hearing the Veteran). We were only interested in the term ‘hearing’ as it applied to legal or court hearings within the judicial system.
