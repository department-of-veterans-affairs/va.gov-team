### Pain Point Discovery
1. **What pain points about decision reviews appear most frequently on r/VeteransBenefits?**
   - Evidence submission confusion
   - Timeline concerns
   - Form complexity
   - Choosing between pathways

2. **What questions do veterans ask repeatedly that our current documentation doesn't address?**

3. **What workarounds or "hacks" do veterans share with each other?**

### Language & Terminology
4. **How do veterans describe decision review processes in their own words?**
   - Do they use VA terminology or their own?
   - What analogies do they use?

### Process Understanding
5. **Where do veterans get confused about the three pathways?**
   - Evidence rules (especially HLR "no new evidence")
   - Timeline expectations
   - What each pathway actually does

6. **What do veterans wish they had known before starting a decision review?**

### External vs Internal Comparison
7. **What pain points appear externally but NOT in VA.gov Medallia/Contact Center data?**

8. **What issues do veterans discuss online but never report to VA?**

---

## TOOLS & METHODS FOR PHASE C

### Reddit Data Collection

**Manual Methods:**
- Reddit search with filters (time range, sort by relevance/recent)
- Save permalinks to valuable threads
- Copy-paste quotes into categorized document

**Automated Methods:**
- Reddit API (requires developer account)
- PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper)
- Pushshift Reddit API (historical data)

**Keyword Search Strings:**
- "supplemental claim" + "confused" OR "help" OR "question"
- "higher level review" + "new evidence" OR "mistake"
- "board appeal" + "timeline" OR "how long"
- "decision review" + "which one" OR "choose"

### Forum Scraping Ethics

**Considerations:**
- All sources identified are public forums
- No PII should be collected
- Use anonymous quotes (no usernames in reports)
- Focus on aggregate patterns, not individual stories
- Respect forum terms of service

### Data Organization

**Suggested Structure:**
```
/external-research/
  /reddit/
    - pain-points-SC.md
    - pain-points-HLR.md
    - pain-points-board-appeal.md
    - pain-points-general-DR.md
    - common-questions.md
    - veteran-workarounds.md
  /hadit/
    - [same structure]
  /government-reports/
    - GAO-findings-summary.md

## LIMITATIONS & CONSIDERATIONS

### Data Quality Concerns

**Self-Selection Bias:**
- Online communities may over-represent:
  - Tech-savvy veterans
  - Veterans with problems (complaint bias)
  - Veterans who seek peer support vs professional help

**Verification Challenges:**
- Cannot verify veteran status in most forums
- Cannot verify accuracy of shared information
- May include misinformation or outdated advice

**Representativeness:**
- May under-represent:
  - Older veterans (less online)
  - Veterans without internet access
  - Veterans who had positive experiences (less likely to post)

### Ethical Considerations

**Privacy:**
- Even public posts deserve respect
- Avoid identifying individuals
- Don't use PII even if publicly posted

**Research Use:**
- Consider informing communities if doing systematic research
- Some forums may have research policies

### Comparison to VA Data

**Strengths of External Data:**
- Unfiltered, authentic veteran voice
- Peer-to-peer advice reveals actual behavior
- May surface issues veterans don't report to VA
- Shows emotional/frustration aspects

**Weaknesses vs VA Data:**
- Cannot measure volume/frequency accurately
- No demographic data
- Quality varies widely
- May be outdated

---

## NEXT STEPS

### Recommended Priority Order

**Phase C - Immediate Focus (1-2 weeks):**
1. r/VeteransBenefits deep dive (pain points extraction)
2. HadIt.com recent discussions review
3. GAO/OIG report synthesis
4. **Deliverable:** "Top 50 Pain Points from External Sources" report

**Phase B - Ongoing Monitoring (2-3 months setup):**
1. Establish monitoring cadence for top 5 sources
2. Build analysis framework
3. Create comparison dashboard (external vs internal VA data)
4. **Deliverable:** "External Data Monitoring System" + monthly insight reports
