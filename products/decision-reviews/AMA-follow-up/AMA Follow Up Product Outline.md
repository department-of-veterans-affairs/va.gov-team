# Overview
The Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) caused a shift from the old or legacy appeals process to the new decision-review process. Some legacy appeals will still be pending for months or years to come. All new appeals must be filed using the decision review process.  As a result, both the decision-review and legacy-appeal processes must coexist on VA.gov. The VA wants to move away from “appeals” language toward “decision review” and “disagreement” language. This is a challenge as “appeal” is a deeply entrenched term, as demonstrated by SEO keyword research.

# Problem Statement
 - As a Veteran, I would like to submit all new appeals under the decision review process.
 - As a Veteran, I would like to use the VA.gov website to find content related to both the decision-review and legacy-appeal processes.
 - As a content writer, I would like to balance plain language [appeal] with the Client’s desire for adoption of decision review      terminology.

# Solution Approach
- IA Recommendations:  Identify optimal structure for content location and entry points, and address nav labeling.
- Move to Drupal:  Identify and rectify anomalies that will allow all decision review pages to be moved from GitHub to Drupal.
- Claim status tool CTAs: Make CTAs for this tool consistent across all pages.
