## Background Context

- For more info see [draft brief](https://dsva.slack.com/docs/T03FECE8V/F0992SF90HL)
- **Problem Summary**
  - Today, claims processors, attorneys, judges, and other employees within VA don't have visibility into the details of failed form & evidence submission attempts made by Veterans, leading to a request being made by the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) and the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA or the Board) for the team to upload a PDF copy of failure notification email contents and other critical metadata to a Veteran's eFolder. 
  - **Volume and Scale Context**
    - Current monthly volume: ~276 failure notification emails
    - Daily average: ~9 emails
    - This low volume influences our architecture decisions below, prioritizing simplicity and reliability over high-performance batch processing
- **Recommended Approach**
  - Option 4: [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) doesn't currently generate PDFs of failure emails, so this would be new functionality for us.
    In this method the must-have metadata (email address and date email was sent) *could* be available in the PDF.
    We can design it so that it's a shared service within `vets-api` that could be extended or leveraged by multiple teams. It's likely that each team might have unique requirements but they should be able to build on our example easily to reduce the effort needed to regenerate a email sent with VA Notify and upload it to a Veteran's eFolder.
  - We recommend our team move forward with Option 4 as a reference implementation.

## LOE Summary

| Aspect                  | Details                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Estimated Duration**  | 4-7 sprints (1 backend engineer at 70% capacity)             |
| **Confidence Level**    | Medium-High (75%) - POC validates core approach but unknowns remain |
| **Risk Buffer**         | 1.5-2 sprints included for unknowns                          |
| **Critical Path Items** | VA Notify data retention validation, Benefits Intake API testing |

#### Why 4-7 Sprints for Low Volume?
- Integration complexity with 3 external systems (VA Notify, Benefits Intake, VBMS)
- 6 distinct email templates requiring individual handling, testing, and error handling
- High reliability requirements (each failure is significant at low volume)
- Building as reference implementation for other teams to follow

#### Delivery Options

| Option            | Duration    | Description                                                  |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Minimal MVP**   | 2-3 sprints | Generate and upload PDFs, no status tracking, manual monitoring |
| **Standard MVP**  | 4-5 sprints | As described below with automated monitoring and basic error handling |
| **Full Featured** | 6-7 sprints | Comprehensive error handling, alerting, retry logic, and reporting |

## Key Assumptions

### Technical Assumptions

1. **PDF can be text/markdown-based** - No pixel-perfect email HTML/CSS rendering required
2. **Benefits Intake API works as documented** - No undocumented quirks or special handling
3. **VA Notify retains data for 7 days** - Per UK.gov docs, needs validation with VA Notify team
4. **No accessibility requirements** - PDFs don't need Section 508 compliance
5. **Staging environment sufficient** - Can adequately test the full flow before production

### Process Assumptions

1. **No scope creep** - Requirements remain as documented
2. **Single developer** - Working at 70% capacity (30% for meetings, reviews, support)
3. **No backfill needed** - Only handling go-forward emails
4. **Standard PR review cycles** - No extended review delays
5. **Stakeholder availability** - For demos and approvals at phase gates

## Technical Unknowns and Risks

### ‚úÖ Validated via POC

- VA Notify's `get_notification` API successfully returns email content
- All 6 email templates can be retrieved with consistent structure
- Personalization fields are redacted but reconstructable
- Notification status updates work as expected
- API authentication using existing keys successful

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Unknowns
#### 1. PDF Generation Requirements (MEDIUM RISK)

- **Impact**: +0.5-1 sprint risk
- **Issue**: Unclear how closely PDF must match email design
- **Unknown Factors**:
  - Markdown-to-PDF sufficient or HTML rendering needed?
  - Special character handling requirements
  - Font/styling requirements from stakeholders
- **Action**: Get sample approved by stakeholders early

## Out of Scope

The following items are explicitly NOT included in this LOE:

- ‚ùå Admin UI for manual PDF regeneration
- ‚ùå Backfilling historical failure emails (before implementation date)
- ‚ùå Generalizing for all VA.gov teams (only Decision Reviews in scope)
- ‚ùå Performance optimization beyond MVP needs
- ‚ùå Section 508 accessibility compliance for PDFs
- ‚ùå Direct VBMS integration (using Benefits Intake API instead)
- ‚ùå Processing emails older than 7 days
- ‚ùå Real-time PDF generation (batch processing only)
- ‚ùå Email template management or updates
- ‚ùå Veteran-facing features or notifications

## External Dependencies

### No Blocking Dependencies

The team can begin development immediately while validating assumptions in parallel.

## MVP Implementation User Stories

1. **As a system**, I can generate PDF versions of successfully delivered failure notification emails that include all must-have metadata
2. **As a system**, I can submit generated PDFs to the Lighthouse Benefits Intake API for routing to VBMS
3. **As a system**, I can track the status of PDFs from upload through VBMS confirmation
4. **As an engineer**, I can monitor and be alerted when PDF generation or upload fails
5. **As a claims processor**, I can see failure notification emails in the Veteran's eFolder

## Proposed Architecture/Implementation

### High-level Overview

Leverage existing `vets-api` infrastructure with minimal new components, processing ~9 emails daily through batch job within the 7-day retention window.

### Technical Details

- Using as much of the existing infrastructure in `vets-api` as possible, e.g.:
  -  `DecisionReviews::FailureNotificationEmailJob` 
  - Custom notification callback classes `DecisionReviews::FormNotificationCallback` and `DecisionReviews::EvidenceNotificationCallback` that validate the delivery status of emails
  - `DecisionReviewNotificationAuditLog` table which tracks delivery status of emails and includes a reference ID that would allow us to locate the original `AppealSubmission`/`SavedClaim` (for Decision Review form uploads), `AppealSubmissionUpload` (for evidence uploads), or`SecondaryAppealForm` (4142s submitted via the Supplemental Claim flow) record for which we sent the failure notification email
    - We will need to update this table with new columns to support tracking the creation and upload of the PDF to VBMS
  - `VaNotify::Service` , which wraps UK.gov's open source `notifications-ruby-client` gem's `Notifications::Client`
    - [notifications-ruby-client gem docs](https://docs.notifications.service.gov.uk/ruby.html) 
    - ~~Although not explicitly exposed in `VaNotify::Service`, POC code below demonstrates that we can use the underlying `Notifications::Client` and existing API key to access the  `get_notification` method, which provides data for one message.~~ We received some [additional guidance from the VANotify team](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C010R6AUPHT/p1757536769497629?thread_ts=1757513765.094709&cid=C010R6AUPHT) and realized that we can use the response from sending the email. **Critically, this response provides the key data needed for this feature, and also represents no change in our current usage of the API**:
      - **the subject line and content of the email that was sent** **and the date the email was sent**
        - the personalisation fields are redacted, but we can recreate those easily with a database lookup
          - Notably: first name and submission attempt timestamps for all submissions, and filenames for evidence uploads
- We will create the following new service classes and Sidekiq jobs in `vets-api` to facilitate generating PDF copies of delivered failure notification emails and uploading them to a Veteran's eFolder:
  - `DecisionReviews::NotificationEmailToPdfService` 
    - Given a notification ID, will fetch message data from VA Notify and generate a PDF version of the email
  - `DecisionReviews::UploadFailureNotificationEmailPdfJob` 
    - A Sidekiq job that we will schedule to run after our daily `DecisionReviews::FailureNotificationEmailJob` 
    - Will query `DecisionReviewNotificationAuditLog` to identify successfully delivered emails that we have not yet created a PDF for/uploaded to LH Benefits Intake API
    - Will invoke `DecisionReviews::NotificationEmailToPdfService`  to generate a PDF and use `BenefitsIntake::Service` to upload the PDF
  - `DecisionReviews::FailureNotificationEmailPdfStatusUpdaterJob` 
    - Similar to our existing `DecisionReviews::SavedClaimStatusUpdaterJob`, a Sidekiq job that we will schedule to run regularly that polls for the status of failure notification email PDFs uploaded via the LH Benefits Intake Service
    - Will update new fields on the `DecisionReviewNotificationAuditLog` to track the status of the uploaded PDF
    - Will alert if PDFs reach an error state or are stuck in a non-final state for >14 days, [per guidance from the LH team](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C5AGLBNRK/p1756996382014779?thread_ts=1756926424.341849&cid=C5AGLBNRK)

## Estimated Timelines 

- We anticipate that the overall delivery of this feature is well-sized for one backend engineer working full-time, adjusted for focus time spent on other tasks like production monitoring, coordination, etc, for ~4-7 sprints, or approximately one quarter.

##### Phase 1: Core PDF Generation Service Development and Integration with Existing VA Notify Callbacks (~1-1.5 sprints)

```ruby
# something like the following
class DecisionReviews::NotificationEmailToPdfService 
  def generate_pdf_from_notification(notification_id:, lookup_data: {})
    # 1. Retrieve notification using VA Notify client
    notification = fetch_notification_details(notification_id)
    
    # 2. Reconstruct full content using lookup_data for redacted fields
    content = reconstruct_full_content(notification, lookup_data)
    
    # 3. Generate PDF with metadata
    generate_pdf_with_metadata(content, notification)
  end
end
```

- Implement feature flag for toggling PDF generation functionality on/off 

- Implement fetching of notification data

- Implement HTML-to-PDF conversion for email content, making sure to include required metadata (email address, send date, template version)

- Goals

  - Demo E2E flow: 

    1. Sending a failure notification email 

    2. Triggering the PDF generation code from the notification callback on successful delivery
    3. Generating the PDF copy of the failure notification email with the required metadata

  - Sample of the most common failure notification email and the corresponding PDF copy, to be shared with the enablement team and stakeholders for review

    - Stretch goal: provide this for all 6 email templates (Higher Level Review form failure, Supplemental Claim form failure, Supplemental Claim evidence failure, Supplemental Claim 4142 failure, NOD/Board Appeal form failure, NOD/Board appeal evidence failure) in production currently

##### Phase 2: Support Async PDF Generation and Upload to eFolder (~1-2 sprints)

- Create `DecisionReviews::UploadFailureNotificationEmailPdfJob` 

- Updates to `DecisionReviewNotificationAuditLog` 

  - Determine schema updates needed 

- Goals:

  - Demo E2E flow: 

    1. Sending a failure notification email 

    2. Triggering ~~the PDF generation code~~ **update of the`DecisionReviewNotificationAuditLog` record**  from the notification callback on successful delivery, **to indicate that we need to generate a PDF and upload it to VBMS for this email**
    3. **Running the new `DecisionReviews::UploadFailureNotificationEmailPdfJob` , which calls the  `DecisionReviews::NotificationEmailToPdfService` to generate the PDF and `BenefitsIntake::Service` to upload the PDF**
    4. Updating the`DecisionReviewNotificationAuditLog` record to indicate that the PDF was generated and submitted to LH Benefits Intake API successfully 
    5. Manually query LH Benefits Intake API to validate receipt of PDF upload

  - Stretch goals: error handling 

##### Phase 3: Status Polling and Logging/Monitoring Updates (~1-2 sprints)

- Add error handling and stress test retry logic
- Implement audit logging
- Coordinate with enablement team on any reporting required for this feature 

##### Phase 4: Testing, Release, and Monitoring in Production (~1-1.5 sprints)

- Thoroughly test feature in staging
- Develop and get release plan approved by enablement team (go/no-go)
- Release feature and monitor impact

---

#### Appendix

- **Does this feature need to go through the Platform Collaboration Cycle?**

  - No. This feature does not meet that requirement according to [Platform docs](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/faqs):

    > Any new tool, product, or page or substantial change to the user experience of an existing tool/product or page should go through the Collaboration Cycle. This means anything that significantly modifies the page‚Äôs content, structure, or interactivity.

- **Design choices for tracking PDF upload to eFolder status** 

  - **Polling for Status Updates**

    - To poll for the status of the email copy PDFs being uploaded to VBMS successfully through the LH Benefits Intake API, we'll have to update our DecisionReviews `StatusUpdaterJob` code. 
    - Other explored alternative: There are other Sidekiq jobs used by multiple teams for polling the LH Benefits Intake APIs for submission statuses, which conveniently roll up into a shared Datadog dashboard veiw. However, as [previously discovered](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C5AGLBNRK/p1755615830513409?thread_ts=1755554628.563939&cid=C5AGLBNRK), our code is not currently wired up to use them. Additionally, the other status updater jobs hinge on `FormSubmissionAttempt` records, which are not suited for the kind of document we are uploading (as they are not form submission attempts).

  - **Storing Status Updates**

    - Recommendation: Update and extend existing `DecisionReviewNotificationAuditLog` table rather than creating separate table.

      - Strong cohesion: PDF upload is a direct consequence of the notification event with tightly coupled lifecycle
      - 1:1 relationship: Each notification produces exactly one PDF, making separate table unnecessary
      - Query efficiency: Most operations require both notification and PDF status data together, avoiding JOIN overhead
      - Operational simplicity: Single source of truth for notification outcomes aligns with existing audit patterns
      - Data consistency: Same retention policies and team ownership for both notification and PDF data

      - Sample required schema additions to `DecisionReviewNotificationAuditLog`

        ```ruby# Replace simple boolean with comprehensive status tracking
        # Something like the following...
        enum email_pdf_status: {
          not_generated: 0,
          pdf_generation_pending: 1,
          pdf_generation_failed: 2,
          upload_pending: 3,
          upload_failed: 4,
          benefits_intake_processing: 5,
          vbms_upload_confirmed
        }
        
        # Additional tracking fields
        
        add_column :pdf_generated_at, :datetime
        add_column :benefits_intake_uuid, :string      # Links to LH Benefits Intake submission
        add_column :benefits_intake_status_details, :text    # Store status information from LH Bnefits Intake API 
        add_column :last_status_check_at, :datetime    # Supports polling workflow
        ```

    - Integration Benefits:
      - Leverages existing status polling infrastructure used for other document uploads
      - Provides end-to-end visibility from notification through eFolder delivery
      - Supports existing monitoring and alerting patterns
      - Enables comprehensive audit trail for compliance requirements

    - This approach maintains architectural simplicity while providing the granular tracking needed for reliable PDF delivery to Veterans' eFolders.

- **Alternative approaches evaluated**

  - ‚ùå Recreating VA Notify's templates and template processing logic in `vets-api`
    - No benefit to duplicating template management logic in two places if we can retrieve our template content another way 
  - ‚ùå Attempting to directly access our VA Notify templates and leverage their existing template processing logic in [notifications-utils](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/notification-utils/blob/main/docs/README.md)
    - Access problems: we can only access our VA Notify templates using the admin UI, which is only available on the VA internal network/via Citrix Access Gateway (CAG)
    - Invoking Python package (`notifications-utils`) from Ruby code (`vets-api`) is risky and error-prone

- **POC code validating technical approach**

  - Performed in Argo `vets-api-staging` Rails console

    - **Critical Note on Data Retention**: The 7-day retention window (per UK.gov documentation) creates a hard constraint on our batch processing approach. If VA Notify's actual retention differs, the architecture may need adjustment to ensure PDFs are generated before data expires.
