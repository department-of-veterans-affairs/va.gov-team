# Additional IA/Nav questions we considered for this research

Documenting general IA/nav questions we have so we don't forget them. We talked through these as we were scoping the 2023 generative research effort, but ultimately decided they were out of scope. We may come back to these later as part of other work.

## OCTO/Stakeholders

- What work is happening across other teams that could effect the navigation (eg. notifications work, sitewide work, health apartment, etc)?
- How do OCTO stakeholders think about VA.gov site navigation? What are some stated and unstated assumptions they have?
- What requirements do outside stakeholders put on VA.gov re: the navigation?
- How will OFCIO work impact our work? How can we impact them?

## Tasks & tools

- What is a "task" on VA.gov? Do users define this as basically anything they come to do (eg. learn about eligibility; check payment status; etc)? How, if at all, does their definition differ from what we consider a task internally (eg. completing a form; managing an individual's benefits)?
- Do people truly come to just "learn", or do they come to do a task (eg. apply) and learning (eg. reading about eligibility) is a by-product of that?
- What role do notifications play in helping people navigate to tools and tasks? 
 
## Reconciling various VA properties/pages

- What actually works better with eBenefits and MHV re: navigation?
- What are the immediate plans for integrating the health apartment into the navigation? 
- Do people utilize the content hubs and resources & support when they are completing tasks? If so, how?
- How will people navigate between My Health and other benefit tools?
- How do we reconcile VA.gov and mobile app so they feel like a unified experience?
- How does getting help/customer support fit into the overall experience of completing tasks/finding tools?

## Technical considerations

- What technical constraints exist around the navigation (eg. Drupal)?
