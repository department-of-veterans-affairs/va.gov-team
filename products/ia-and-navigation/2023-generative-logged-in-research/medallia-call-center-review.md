# Medallia and call center data review

## Goals

- To understand what feedback we get in through Medallia or call center data around challenges people have navigating/finding tasks and tools on VA.gov, especially while signed in (**Note**: It is OK if we can't glean whether people are signed in or out).

**Out of scope**

- We do not need to capture data on issues people are having with specific tools. 

## Methods

### Medallia

- Use automated text analysis to do a keyword search to help sift through data.
- Let's start broad. If we aren't able to get helpful information, we may want to focus more closely on specific tools.

#### Potential keywords to search

- Navigation
- Find/Can't find
- Where do I go?
- (Common search terms in GA?)

### Call center

- Pull data based on existing call center categories.
- From there, do manual keyword analysis of feedback.

### Findings

- Create Github document with findings and recommendations in the 2023-generative-loggedin-research folder.

## Questions to answer

**During what time period should we be pulling analytics?**

Based on the questions posed in our [research outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ia-and-navigation/2023-generative-logged-in-research/README.md), we can potentially find supporting data that will help us address the following questions:

### Navigating to tasks & tools

- What do people have trouble finding on VA.gov (eg. "I couldn't find X tool/info because it was buried.")?
- When in a particular flow do people run into trouble with finding information?
