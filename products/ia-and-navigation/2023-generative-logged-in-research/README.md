## Overview

While we've observed some high-level problems people have navigating VA.gov's logged-in experience (eg. people are reliant on homepage and My VA links), we've never conducted research that is solely dedicated to this topic. To remedy this, we plan to conduct research in early 2023 that helps us clarify exactly what problems exist with the logged-in navigation, where we are not meeting users' expectations, and what we might do to improve the overall experience. This work will help guide meaningful improvements to the logged-in IA and navigation in the coming year.

## Problems

- The current VA.gov experience caters to an unuathenticated content, which can bury tasks people need to complete.
- People tend to rely heavily on the homepage top tasks or My VA links to navigate.
- We aren't sure what motivates people to sign in, and when they do this in a given flow.
- We don't have broader insights into problems and expectations people have navigating VA.gov when they are logged in.
- OCTO has historically treated unauth and auth experiences as if they are two distinct experiences instead of two halves of one flow, which means the IA and navigation has developed in a silo'd manner that doesn't consider logged in users' needs and expectations.
- People have historically viewed the My VA dashboard as *the* logged in experience, instead of thinking of things more holistically.

## Goals

### Research goals

- Determine if there is a difference in what people do logged in vs. logged out on VA.gov (not what they *can* do, but what they expect/want to do).
- Understand what motivates people to login, when in a flow they login, and where (eg. homepage, etc).
- Understand what issues people have navigating to tools and tasks when they are logged in to VA.gov.
- Understand what peoples' expectations are for navigating to tools and tasks when they are logged in to VA.gov.
- If applicable, extrapolate learnings to logged out flows as well instead of thinking of wayfinding as two distinct or competing experiences (unauth vs. auth).

### Process goals

- Understand what research has already been done, and establish what we already know about wayfinding issues and challenges on VA.gov.
- Understand what work is happening re: IA and navigation on other teams, so that we don't do competing or conflicting work.
- Work collaboratively across crews, so this work isn't silo'd.

## Project risks & challenges

### Insights may affect other teams, or VA.gov more broadly 

If our research suggests that more broad updates to the navigation need to happen, this obviously affects all crews. Everyone would need to be onboard and to work together to make and approve updates: 

- Auth - My VA, profile, notifications, chatbot
- Sitewide - Unauth home, benefit hubs, R&S, header
- Health - My health
- Benefits - IA and labeling
- Platform - design system
- Mobile app - IA and labeling

### There is no centralized IA team

Right now, Mikki is being treated as a team of one who is responsible for too many IA/navigation-related tasks and projects. We are able to support this effort by working cross-team (Mikki, auth experience, call center team), but OCTO is not used to working in this way. There will be challenges around coordination across teams, making sure we have the right people to do the work, and potentially not having a single researcher who is involved the whole time.

### People still view IA/navigation as "unauth" and "auth"

Though we are focusing research on issues people have once they are signed in to VA.gov, given that the navigation is almost entirely the same between unauth and auth states, we can not ignore the fact that these aren't entirely two separate and distinct experiences, as our team has historically treated them. We've become a team that is updating the site in a way that reflects how we're set up as a "business" and how we've defined our own products, not necessarily how users expect to holistically navigate. 

## Questions

### Signing in to VA.gov

- Why do people sign in to VA.gov? When? What prompts them to? Where on the site?
- Are our patterns to prompt people to sign in effective? How could that be improved? What is confusing/overwhelming/doesn't meet expectations (outside of the known issues with the actual login credentials)?

### Navigating to tasks & tools

- What tasks do people come to VA.gov to do? What tasks do they specifically intend to sign in to do?
- What are the known problems for users around navigating to tasks and tools when they are logged in to VA.gov (eg. reliance on homepage or My VA quick links)? What's not working?
- If people can not rely on quick links on the homepage or My VA to navigate, how do they get to tasks?
- What are people's expectations for how they should be able to navigate to tasks when they are logged in if they can not rely on homepage or My VA links?
- How similar should the navigation be from a logged out to logged in state? This isn't something we'd ask, but something we'd extrapolate from observations.

### User types

- We already know about what's important to veterans when they are logged in (eg. claims, health info, etc). What is important to other key user groups (eg. transitioning service members; families; caregivers)?
- What problems with navigating the logged-in experience are shared among user groups? What problems are unique by user type?
- What expectations with navigating the logged-in experience are shared among user groups? What expectations are unique by user type?

### Reconciling various VA properties/pages

- How do users make sense of the homepage and My VA when they are logged in? Do they need both? (Note: My VA does not exist in a logged-out state)

## Scope

### In scope

- Evaluating problems and expectations around navigation and IA in the logged in experience.
- Conducting a research review to determine what existing problems and user expectations we already know of re: navigating VA.gov while logged in experience, and to determine what outstanding questions we still have.
- Conducting an analytics review to help us understand how people move through the site while logged in.
- Conducting a call center and Medallia data review to see what we can learn about problems people have finding tasks and tools.
- Conducting user research to answer questions we haven't answered in other parts of our research, and to gain additional insight into problems and expecations people have with navigating VA.gov while logged in.

### Out of scope

- Evaluating stakeholder requirements/opinions/expectations around navigation.
- Evaluating technical constraints around updating navigation.
- Testing UI mockups or prototypes of an ideal/potential logged-in state.
- Evaluating specific questions around the health apartment.
- Mocking up new navigation updates or patterns as part of our findings.
- Capturing specific problems with individual products (eg. login credentials, claim status tool, etc).
