# Research review

## Goals

### Determine what we already know

This includes:

- Challenges with navigating the logged in experience that we're already well aware of (eg. people being reliant on homepage and My VA links).
- Veteran top tasks that we've already seen demonstrated through research and analytics that we don't need to rehash (eg. health care and claims are the most popular tasks/tools on the site).
- Known expectations around the logged in experience (eg. people expect it to be personalized).

### Determine what we need more information on

This includes:

- Documenting any initial findings that maybe show in one or two reports, but on which we'd like to gather more information.
  - Where helpful, include context for specific tasks in case it's relevant to a finding (eg. if something was really specific around the homepage, put it in context).
  - If applicable, include thoughts on how we can potentially explore findings further (eg. homepage research was just about the homepage. How can we expand on it?).
- Determining where we still have outstanding questions that have not been covered in any previous research.

## Questions to answer

Based on the questions posed in our [research outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ia-and-navigation/2023-generative-logged-in-research/README.md), what information do we potentially have on the following? **It is ok if we can not answer all of these questions**. Part of this effort is to determine where there are still holes in our knowledge.

### Signing in to VA.gov

- Do we have information on the following:
  - When do people sign in to VA.gov? Do they intend to do it first thing, or only after finding a page that tells them they need to sign in?
  - Are people able to find prompts to sign in easily?  

### Navigating to tasks & tools

- What are the known challenges do people have navigating the logged in experience (eg. reliance on homepage/My VA links)? 
- How easy/hard is it to find tasks that require people to be logged in?
- What tasks do people come to complete (eg. we already know disability and health care info are primary, so worth reiterating and moving on quickly)?
- What are other known insights around navigating the site/logged in experience?
- What do we not know at this point? What would be helpful to get more information on?
