# Information architecture activities 

### The problem we're trying to solve:
The VA.gov team has not had the resources to focus on how things are organized **across the whole veteran experience.** Any interaction a veteran has with the VA should be seamless. To get there, information architecture (IA), content, and design need to work together on **everything.**
<br></br>
### Who's involved?
For IA strategy and planning, the information architects work with DEPO leads, product owners, content strategists, and designers. **The information architects are:**
* DEPO: [Meg Peters](https://github.com/mpeterz)
* Platform: [Mikki Northius](https://github.com/mnorthuis), who supports VSP teams with [guidance, best practices, and standards for information architecture](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/information-architecture).  
<br></br>
### What we're doing and planning.

**1) Working on a framework to regularly evaluate the health of VA.gov’s information architecture.** 

We'll focus on how users navigate the site on both mobile and desktop, whether they are signed in or not. We'll find out things like:
  * How well can veterans do important tasks?
  * Where do they struggle? 
  * How can we make improvements? 
  * By doing certain things, have we improved the site or not? 

**We plan to regularly test the IA health of VA.gov and compare results over time.** To do this, we'll set up a repeatable framework of quantitative and qualitative measures, including: 
  * baseline testing of top tasks;
  * [Google Analytics for top tasks and mobile](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/global/IA-strategy%2Bplanning/analytics/top-task-analytics.md); 
  * search metrics; and
  * an expert review of VA.gov.

**2) Recommending current and future IA work based on these regular evaluations ^ of VA.gov.**
And showing how we can help.

**3) Working with the [#ia-forum](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/ia-forum) and others in DEPO to prioritize IA projects:**
  * Where do they think users struggle?
  * What projects need IA help the most?
  * What are other considerations? 
<br></br>
### We've kicked off discussion and sharing about IA.

* **IA planning roadmap:** [The latest IA planning roadmap](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/global/IA-strategy%2Bplanning/IA-planning-roadmap.pdf) shows the (hopefully) full landscape of projects that involve IA. **(Download the roadmap for easier reading.)**
* **Slack:** Members, please post ideas, input, and examples to [#ia-forum](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/ia-forum) or [#va-cto-team](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/va-cto-team)!
* **Meetings and discussions:**  
  * **June 24** we discussed and got feedback on:
    * Our [plan for IA work](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/global/IA-strategy%2Bplanning/presentations/IA-at-VA-planning-6-24-2020.pdf); 
    * The [IA planning roadmap](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/global/IA-strategy%2Bplanning/IA-planning-roadmap.pdf); and
    * The smaller "slice" of the roadmap: [the projects we're working on now or starting soon](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1592598791785/debc1b99ef8b34444174e7ab691b4757b4027d66).
  * **June 17** we gave a [presentation on IA planning](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/global/IA-strategy%2Bplanning/presentations/IA-at-VA-6-17-2020.pdf) in the biweekly VA.gov platform review for DEPO/CTO staff.
<br></br>
### Soon we’ll define the IA role, responsibilities, and the best ways to work across teams.

* **IA role and responsibilities:** In the IA workshop June 29, we'd like to discuss:
  * Who does which IA work? (DEPO v. Platform)
  * How do we bridge between DEPO and Platform?
  * How do we balance current and future IA needs?
  
* **Best ways to work together:** Let's continue the talks already underway and think about:
  * How do we identify projects that need IA early on?
  * What's the workflow between product, content, IA, visual design, and dev (Drupal)?
