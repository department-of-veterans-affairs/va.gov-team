# Top task analytics 

**We've been researching the top tasks people do on VA.gov to prepare for baseline usability testing.** 

We plan to test top tasks with veterans regularly on both desktop and mobile devices. Over time, this will show us whether updates to IA, design, and content are making it easier for veterans to use VA.gov.

One caveat to the numbers below is that sessions expire after 30 minutes. So users may have visited the site, done nothing for 30+ minutes, then resumed —- and that counts as a new session.


### Mobile usage for all VA websites
[This mobile usage report for June 3, 2019 to June 3, 2020](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/report/visitors-overview/a50123418w177519031p176188361/_u.date00=20190603&_u.date01=20200603&_.useg=builtin1,builtin28,builtin26/) shows mobile and tablet usage for all VA websites with new users broken out.

### Top tasks for modernized pages only
[This page views report for June 3, 2019 to June 3, 2020](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/?authuser=0#/report/content-pages/a50123418w177519031p184624291/_u.date00=20190603&_u.date01=20200603&explorer-table.plotKeys=%5B%5D&explorer-table.rowCount=50&explorer-table.rowStart=0&_.useg=builtin1/) shows users of VA.gov doing the tasks below. "Modernized pages" are pages that have been converted to the standard VA.gov design, written in plain language, and optimized for SEO.

**Within the top 50 page views, we combined multiple pages for the same task into a single row.** (Examples: track claims, download VA letters, check education benefits)

### Top pages for all VA websites
[This page views report for June 3, 2019 to June 3, 2020](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/report/content-pages/a50123418w177519031p176188361/_u.date00=20190603&_u.date01=20200603&explorer-table.plotKeys=%5B%5D&explorer-table.rowCount=5000&explorer-segmentExplorer.segmentId=analytics.pageTitle/) shows usage of VA.gov, MyHealtheVet, and eBenefits. 

Because of the limitations and quirks of Google Analytics, the "pages" below are actually groups of pages represented by one < title > tag. For this reason, we did not combine rows below that are part of the same task. (Example: On MyHealtheVet, we would consider "secure messaging" and "compose message" parts of the same task.)
