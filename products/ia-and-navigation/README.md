## Overview

VA.gov is responsible for a large quantity of information, and it is critical that the site remains intuitive and navigable to users and manageable from a governance perspective. The goal of ongoing IA and navigation work is to keep VA.gov organized and navigable as the site grows, especially as we consolidate eBenefits and MHV into its architecture and functionality. Ongoing IA and navigation work primarily focuses on the veteran experience and those within the veteran sphere (service members, families, dependents, caregivers, etc).

## Problems & opportunities

### Problems

- The current IA and navigation largely caters to logged-out, unauthenticated flows and content. This makes it hard for users who need to manage their health and benefits to complete tasks.
- Figuring out how all of MyHealtheVet fits into VA.gov means there will be some major changes to IA and navigation, and how we approach this has to not only consider the health user experience, but also how this will affect management of other benefits.
- IA and navigation needs to work for multiple audiences, including audiences that are not veterans, service members, families, and caregivers. This can sometimes cause organizational friction since our team wants to prioritize the veteran experiences over business wants and needs.

### Opportunities

We have opportunities to:

- Treat IA and navigation like any other product, and do continual work and maintenance in this space so our site remains organizable and navigable.
- Rethink how we approach prioritizing task-based flows and navigation through the health apartment work.
- Work more collaboratively across unauth and auth experiences, to consider flows through both instead of considering them as two separate experiences.

## User outcomes

### Desired user outcomes

Veterans (including soon-to-be veterans), those involved in their care or benefit management, and those who receive benefits as a result of their relationship to a veteran should be able to:

- Learn about new benefits they do not currently receive.
- Manage existing benefits.
- Get help if they are having trouble.

### Undesired user outcomes

Undesired user outcomes for veterans (including soon-to-be veterans), those involved in their care or benefit management, and those who receive benefits as a result of their relationship to a veteran include:

- Not being able to easily complete a task on VA.gov.
- Not being able to get help when they need it.

## Business outcomes

### Desired business outcomes

- Users are able to easily complete tasks, regardless of whether they start in a logged-in or logged-out state.
- The primary focus of our IA and navigation remains on the overall veteran experience and does not get overtaken by business needs and wants.

### Undesired business outcomes

- Our IA and navigation continues to reflect OCTO teams are set up, not how users want to expect to move through information.
- We keep thinking of unauth and auth experiences as two separate experiences instead of two halves of the same experience.
