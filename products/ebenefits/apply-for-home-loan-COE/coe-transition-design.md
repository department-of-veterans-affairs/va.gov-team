## Feature background
A VA-issued Certificate of Eligibility (COE) is needed by Veterans, service members and surviving spouses looking to get a VA-backed home loan or Native American Direct Loan (NADL). There are service-based requirements for obtaining VA loans, and a COE confirms for lenders that an applicant qualifies for this benefit. Specific requirements depend on service dates and details.

Home loan applicants must apply for a COE to ensure they meet eligibility requirements.
