## Findings
Keyboard navigation and aXe tests were used throughout the COE application (My COE and Form app) to check for accessibility compliance. Two issues were found:
1. Confirmation page header progression should only increase by one - documented in [this issue](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/31226)
2. Application should only have one `<h1>`- documented in [this ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/31223)
