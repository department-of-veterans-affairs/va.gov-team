## Warm-up
**M:** Thank you. Okay. Well, to start out, if you would, please just tell us a little bit about yourself, maybe starting with your services?

**P2:** Sure. I did. Eight years of active duty separated and I've been in the reserves now for three years. Okay. Just about three. All right.

**M:** Sounds good. Hold on one sec. I am doing a technical thing I'm going to There we go. Cancel. All right. I had a participant show up in the inside. Okay. Um, so have you applied for a VA back long before or Native American direct loan?

**P2:** I said just just recently.

## Section one: The loan process

**M:** Okay, so you've got some really recent hands on experience? Yeah. How would you? Do you remember how you learned about this benefit?

**P2:** Um, it was usually just word of mouth. Right? I know, when, and, you know, I was reminded about it during top class, as well.

**M:** Okay. And that that's, uh, on separation, they run you through that to give you an idea of what sort of benefits to expect. Right? Right. Okay. Have you ever visited either va.gov? Or maybe he benefits? Okay, well, let's use the sites for let's start out with va.gov would have used that site for

**P2:** I haven't used va.gov as much as like, directly logging into my u benefits. va.gov. More recently, I guess? Because it seems like a lot of stuff would just redirect there first. But mostly for disability claims. Okay.

**M:** You're definitely running into part of what we're working on. If you go to EAD benefits, a lot of times it will send you straight back to va.gov. So you have more experience with the benefits then? Yeah. Okay. And what do you do with that

**P2:** time? Just processing disability and. Okay, the claims process?

**M:** Sounds good. So you mentioned that you've very recently gone through the loan process, or heard about it mostly from word of mouth. So when you apply for the loan, and I'm not sure where you are in that process of you're all the way through what you're all the way through? Great. Yeah. Can you outline for us the steps in your process? Just kind of big picture how it went? You know,

**P2:** I don't think I had to do anything with the VA. I think the bank handled pretty much everything. Okay. I did print off my, like disability claim form. But that was kind of the only thing I had to do the bank work with, with the VA to verify me.

**M:** All right, yeah, that is how it goes for a lot of people to the lenders have a direct line, and they're able to navigate,

**P2:** fill out some paperwork, asking about the VA stuff, like, and I think some of that were VA specific forms that were in the package, if I recall. Okay. And I, you know, I think I'm guessing that's what went to the VA. So I suppose I probably filled out some VA forms during the process. Okay,

**M:** so basically, you, you went to the lender and mentioned that you were a veteran, and they said, Great, we've got a packet for you. And among them were paper forms. Is that how you? Yeah,

**P2:** I mean, the electronic versions of some paper forms. Yeah.

**M:** Okay. So no websites and involved with them.

**M:** So when you were going through this process, what do you what do you feel was like the biggest help, or the biggest bonus, you know, in getting you through successfully?

**P2:** Um, in terms of actually like completing? Yeah. And just getting through the process. It could be a person could be uniform or whatever, ability to use DocuSign. That was a tool that they employed, the bank employed, okay. They took the paper forms, but they use DocuSign to create the fill in for like, amounts, numbers, signatures and initials. And so I could I literally did it all from my phone.

**M:** Wow. So that was super convenient.

**P2:** Yeah, I didn't have to go through another website. They just took the existing stuff and added a DocuSign to it. Okay.

**M:** So would you say that that was one of the things that went, you know, the best in the course of getting this done? You know,

**P2:** yeah, it was very smoothly like they having them do everything I was able to bottom line sign my stuff. So I knew it, you know, the information had to be okay. And then they just had to follow a follow up and follow through. I know that if something didn't match, the VA would have to reach out somehow. So it gave me the peace of mind being able to control the information that went forward, and just having that Do everything, you know, they scheduled the, you know, the VA home appraisal for me, they took the forms and verified my eligibility, they made sure I was in good standing and I wasn't like delinquent to any debts or anything with the VA was really helpful.

**M:** Great. Well, sounds like you were in really good hands there.

**P2:** Yeah.

**M:** I was thinking about the process. It sounds like it went really well. Oh, what would you say was the biggest stumbling block that showed up in that process?

**P2:** He went really smooth. I didn't really? I didn't really have any I mean, um,

**M:** there doesn't have to be,

**P2:** it would be preferable. I mean, and then proven point might be like, if I could have, you know, provided them with a certificate of eligibility instead of, I mean, I know, like those exist, obviously. But if I could have instead of filling out those forms, with them, if I could have like, done something on my own, and given them something with a confirmation number, right, um, that might have given me a little peace of mind, because I had to fill out these forms, right? And then they're processing authority issues, I still have to, like, rely on them. And, you know, with me, I'm in the reserves, and you can't get paid your disability benefit and reserve benefit at the same time. Okay, so every year, you have to kind of, like settle that with the VA. And I had settled my stuff, a couple weeks prior to this happening. And, you know, in the back of my head, I'm like, Oh, I hope that like the process has caught up. I hope they showed me not as delinquent. You know, what I mean? I've done that on my own, I would have been able just like, Hey, I went to the VA, I'm good. And, you know, scan this barcode or check this confirmation, and you can verify it, like it would have just given me a little peace of mind. Right? And, I guess, assurance in the process,

**M:** right? Sounds good. So just to kind of reflect that back to you, it sounds like everything went really well. And that if there was something that maybe could be improved, if you had some sort of self service thing where you could go and just make sure that the documentation is done, and then come to the lender with the documentation in hand, you would save a step or you you'd save that little tiny peace of mind.

**P2:** Yeah, but like a very, like something as easy as like printing off something, you know what I mean? Yeah. Because I, the VA sometimes can take processes and make them convoluted or complicated. And the customer service mechanism isn't really that easy. Right? You know, sometimes you have to go to their generic website and fill out like a contact form and hope that it goes to the right place kind of thing. Okay, I say that with like, some cautious has a tation. You know,

**M:** right now, that's, that's okay. That's, and that's understandable. We do talk to a lot of veterans, and we do here, you know, a lot of, you know, how this this, these lines of contact, go for them?

## Section two: COE
**M:** you mentioned certificate of eligibility, could you tell us what that certificate of eligibility is?

**P2:** So I didn't have to provide them with one. But I've also had to provide university with them, because I use GI Bill benefits for it. Okay, um, and essentially, when you're using the GAO educational benefits, you have to, like, certify. And so you have to tell the VA, like, you know, where you're going to school, what your program of study, and it's this, really, it's like a 10 page thing that they send you. And usually the school gets it too. So if they have like a veteran office, it's very helpful, but right, that's, I guess, why I sort of sensible, hesitant thinking back to that process.

**M:** Okay. So then, as far as the certificate of eligibility, if there was one in your loan package, the lender took care of that. You never actually saw any of that, you know, okay, right. All right. But do you know, in general, what it is?

**P2:** I have, I assume that it tests that I'm eligible for a VA back home.

**M:** All right now, that's fine. It's it. We're just trying to gauge you know, the awareness of what this document is for veterans, for people who are going to be using them. So just get that baseline. All right, appreciate that. Do you know, let's say just knowing generally about certificate of eligibility and or the VA home loan benefit, you'd mentioned something about the education loans, do you know any other requirements for a certificate of eligibility or maybe just generally about VA loans, VA back loans?

**P2:** I imagine I'd have to be in good standing not be like financially delinquent with the VA. Right. I'm not have any other VA loans. That sort of thing. I am. Yeah. And I think a lot of that stuff for me. Like just came from discussions among You know, colleagues in the military, but I know a tap class too. They really like hammer hard on some of those things. Okay.

**M:** Yeah, that's we do hear that quite a bit that a lot of people go to their, you know, fellow veterans go to websites, Facebook and those sorts of things, just kind of get word of mouth info on these things. Okay, we are right about quite a bit of what's required for that. You mentioned a little bit about some documentation that you had to provide. Was there any issue providing that documentation to the lender to get through that CSV or that online process?

**P2:** Now, it's pretty straightforward. All the questions are really fair. Okay. I had to like look up a couple things from my own records, but it was very, very easy. And the only thing and this is just like a knowledge thing that I didn't fully understand was, I didn't know that I would have to pay as many of like the closing costs and close, close closing fees. Okay? Because when you compare this benefit to like, your educational benefits, you know, if you go to a school that has Yellow Ribbon Program, for example, you don't pay a single penny, right? So just kind of understand the difference in that benefit.

**M:** Okay, so that's something that you you feel like you wish you knew a little more clearly, upfront. Yeah. Just what you'd be responsible for. That's good to know that, you know, that's the sort of insight that, you know, can help us down the road, when we take feature, move it over. And then you know, what can we do better? So we tried to surface that. So that's a great, that's a great piece of feedback right there. So not to beat the the certificate of eligibility thing. If your lender didn't provide that to you? How would you go about getting a certificate of eligibility just thinking back to maybe you got to provide us with this document? Yeah, we'll try to get that.

**P2:** probably try to go to the benefits and see if there was one somewhere in there. Okay. Like, can they, you know, messages or documents or inbox? And if there wasn't, then I probably Google that again. And I'd expect to probably to be brought to the my VA site. And try and find it from there. Now,

**M:** that sounds good. So just kind of a standard web search, hit the websites first. See if they've got it there. Okay.

**P2:** That sounds great. And the only reason I don't know if it matters, but like my preference toward gi benefits opposed to my VA is I just feels like he benefits is really geared toward, like action items, like everything is an action item. Right? you view this, I want to click this. And when I go to my VA, I feel like sometimes these are articles that sometimes I'll have like a link at the bottom to do something with it.

## Section three: tools and features
**M:** no, that makes perfect sense. Someone who stares at that day in day out, I think I know exactly what you're talking about. So what you get from va.gov is a lot of content, a lot of words, a lot of information versus Yeah. Benefits. It seems to be a place where you can actually go and do things and be a tool. Okay. No, I think that's, that's good feedback for us. And we're trying to turn that around. So that's part of what we're doing here and trying to migrate this one feature. Okay, well, we're moving on to pretty much the last section. So let's see you you've talked a little bit about your experiences with VA websites. In the course of managing your benefits, you say that you don't use va.gov that much you use more benefits. So what are what are some experience with the benefits that you feel are particularly good? And then maybe some that are not so good? You could just describe those for us?

**P2:** I think just being able to view documents, like they're right there. Yeah, whatever you're looking for, it seems like a central repository. Okay. Um, and I, I just kind of like, all in one place. And I feel like I'm my login to the benefits. I feel like I'm logged into my own database in my records and my tools, right? Whereas when I use my va.gov, I kind of feel sometimes I'm wondering if I'm logged in, or if I'm logged out if my stuff is saved, because sometimes it'll bummed me out to like an article and I don't want the article. So it gives me more ease like I'm, you know, I know it's older, but I'm in it.

**M:** Okay, now that makes sense. So it sounds like the good thing is kind of like a one stop for you. And it's all personalized and it's all yours and it keeps you in one spot. Yeah, that right. Okay. And then va.gov, on the other hand, tends to sort of throw you out to articles or pages, okay. And then,

**P2:** you know, if I sometimes I'll go to a page like more than once to try to find Like, you know what I'm actually looking for because, like, the aesthetics are really nice. But sometimes things blend in too much for me. And sometimes, like the button I'm supposed to use looks like, you know, just something else in like an article that I read on a different kind of website, I guess.

**M:** Okay, come on, let us get back to, because we are working on, you know, the look and feel of it, the screens themselves. So that sort of stuffs also really important, we try to get that out of the food chain, too. So, if you were to, let's say, at some point in the future, or if you were to go back in time and go through this SBA loan process again, how do you feel about going to VA websites for some of the documentation or some of the process? How does that strike you? I mentioned before that you could get some of this documentation and have it in hand. Can you kind of expand on that a little bit?

**P2:** Yeah. Like, are you familiar with mill connect from active duty? I've heard of it, I haven't seen it. So essentially, it's, um, it's similar to like, any benefits. And one thing that they host are the TRICARE health care, you know, some of your info like, you know, your dependents, your self. And you can generate on the site immediately a certificate of like, coverage, like proof of something, right. And all it is, is like clicking through three pages. And it'll tell you, okay, you have a new item in your inbox, and it's your certificate that you requested, okay? Something like really simple like that. Okay, that can take the information that's already there, and just generate something without having to, you know, wait, or, you know, fill out some bigger request or, you know, get verified, it's just like a robot like a bot does it, you know,

**M:** right. Okay. Now, that sounds really good. There is something that's kind of sort of like that port Civ. It's not the most in your face feature. But it is sort of, depending on your, your background, they could produce a CSV for you. So I like that. I do understand that concept of what you're talking about, where you you fill out certain amount of information, and he gets a good one. So that is good. And we're definitely going to try to maintain that as we move it over.

**P2:** So and that sounds good to you. I probably would have been familiar if I had to, if I was prompted to go get stuff from the VA, you know what I mean? Exactly? Yes. In my case, my I didn't have to do that.

**M:** Okay, so yeah, it sounds like you, you had a pretty good experience, it went end to end with not a whole lot of problems. And the lender kind of took you through the whole thing. So that's, that's a great scenario right there. And it's kind of think about how that might be better. But you had mentioned before that maybe if there was some documentation, instead of seeing in the packet and filling it all out that you could, you know, kind of go somewhere and generate that? How would you kind of how would you expect? He benefits? Or, you know, since we're moving over to va.gov? How would you expect us to deliver that stuff to you? How, how can we give you those documents so that you wouldn't have to worry about filling them out? How would you find them?

**P2:** Like it? Like how would I do it with what exists now? Or what would I like to see

**M:** Yeah, exactly. What would you like to see, that's a better way of standing. You know,

**P2:** it'd be nice if you could just be like, you know, maybe there's like, you could do a few ways, but a few ways to bring you to a page like thinking of buying a home or like hey, you know, prepare for home buying. obtain your, you know, obtain a pre approval document, our eligibility documents here, you know, like your mortgage under my ask for these. Okay, and maybe just, again, with stuff that's already in there, like the opportunity to correct if need be, but just like Click, click, click, you know, maybe a few screens next, next and then, right, there you go.

**M:** Okay. So if I were to paraphrase, it sounds like you would like some sort of, hey, buying a home, here's a checklist, some things to do, and then maybe take you to the, you know, the service point or something that can make that document for you. Once you fill in some info or once it looks you up. Is that fair? Yes. Good, cool.

**P2:** Because, you know, like, we're giving these forms to the banks, and that's fine because they process but they don't need to really know how long they get the bottom line for the bank is, you know, besides the stuff they want to know, like, okay, what's my salary is does the VA endorses loan writing or does the VA say I'm good? Morning, they're standing so then they can apply? Let's just kind of my thoughts on it.

**M:** Yeah. And that is the you know, the bottom line for that certificate of eligibility. It's it's the It's just what you're talking about, it's the certification for the bank that you are eligible for this benefit. So I can proceed with that. So very good. Well, the last, the last question I had to do about tools and features, and those sorts of things is thinking about the process. Let's say somebody comes to you, and you talked about word of mouth is kind of how people find out a lot of this information. So if somebody were to come to you and talk about the, the home loan process or anything about CMV, what sort of advice could you give that person? What would you tell them?

**P2:** If they were looking for a cure?

**M:** Or, or just thinking in terms of the whole process end to end, like the home loan process? But if CEO, he factors into it, of course, that too, but, you know, hey, I'm going to go and get a loan? What What can you tell me?

**P2:** I mean, I probably tell them, you know, shop around for the best rate first. Okay. And then, you know, like, that's, like, the important part. And, you know, I'd probably tell them to try to find somebody who's experienced that recommend who I went through. Okay, it just makes it easier. You know, and then if, you know, they had a better rate, but the person was less experienced i'd, you know, I tell him, I'd probably just tell him to Google how to get a CEO he

**M:** gotcha. So just thinking in terms of the bottom line is you want the rate to be the best you can get, so that I can understand going out and getting that good rate. But then having the experience of dealing with VA, and with veterans buying homes and those benefits, you can kind of weigh those in the balance. And you'd go with somebody who understood the veterans

**P2:** situation where we're, or if if all things are considered equal, but yeah, I would go for the lowest rate first, that makes such a difference. I want to make sure I was hearing that right. Yeah. Sorry. Like, if perfect world with all the stars aligned for me to happen to align? Yeah. And so, you know, I would probably advise about that. But I wouldn't say like, you know, $30,000 difference over time would be worth not doing some live work on your own, you know, agreeable. Yeah,

**M:** I understand. All right. Well, that's pretty much all I've got at this point on my list, and we're right at time. 1130 on the.is. there anything else that you would like for us to know about? You know, any of the things that we've talked about here, you know, be a website's e benefits? Anything else coming on?

**P2:** No, I don't think so. Unless it any other questions for me?

**M:** No, no, I think we have hit pretty much everything. So I really appreciate you taking the time to talk with us.
