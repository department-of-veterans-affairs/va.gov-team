**P5:**  0:05  
Thank you. Okay. Just to start out, if you could tell us a little bit about yourself, maybe starting with your service history or just general experiences with VA?

**P5:**  0:16  
Yeah,

**P5:**  0:16  
um, yeah, I've been in the army for a little under nine years now. commissioned out of West Point, and then I'm actually transitioning out of the military here and the next few months. Yeah.

**P5:**  0:32  
Okay. So you are a you're an active duty servicemen at this point, but you're in transition going through tap and that sort of stuff.

**P5:**  0:39  
Yes. Yeah. I'm actually doing the CSP right now. So I finished tap and and all that a little bit ago. All right. Yeah.

**P5:**  0:48  
So have you applied for a VA loan or via direct, like, Native American direct loan? Have you done that? In the past?

**P5:**  0:57  
I applied for a home loan. Home Loan. Okay. Yeah.

**P5:**  1:03  
Now, where did you learn about the the VA home loan benefit?

**P5:**  1:08  
I'm tough to say. I mean, I feel like you just kind of hear about it coming out of school. I feel like I've just always kind of known about I couldn't really pinpoint.

**P5:**  1:19  
Yeah, I hear that time. Yeah. In the year, and you just you just have general awareness of that particular event. Okay. So nothing specific there.

**P5:**  1:30  
All right. Yeah. I had a good friend who, who did buy a house and I lived in that house. And so I mean, I probably learned a bit from him, but I'm sure I knew about it before that.

**P5:**  1:44  
Okay. Sounds good. So when you have applied for a VA home loan before, do you remember the steps in that process, you know, outside of dealing with VA, just kind of the end to end process? Can you describe that once? Yeah,

**P5:**  2:00  
I mean,

**P5:**  2:03  
yeah, I guess I don't remember a ton of specific so I bought the house in 2019. And while I was deployed, um, so I was doing a lot of this while in a rack. So first thing I got what the realtor figured out what house we were looking at, and then they sent us to, you know, LA, loan manager. And then I just kind of worked with her and kind of did whatever she asked me to do to help me get the loan going.

**P5:**  2:41  
Okay, so that loan manager just basically took you through the process step by step. Right. And yeah, the thing was remote because you were deployed.

**P5:**  2:49  
Right? Yeah, I didn't sign any physical pieces of paper. I just, I did signed everything on the computer. And then my wife, fiance at the time did all the physical Signing Day of of actual buying the house, because I still Iraq for another few few weeks.

**P5:**  3:12  
Do you remember at any point in this, and I imagine it is going to be kind of a blur, because you were so far removed, but any particular VA steps in this process? Something that not necessarily the bank needed, but VA needed.

**P5:**  3:29  
So yeah, I, I vaguely remember needing to get like a memo signed, that had like, my information on it. Okay, um, but I'm not sure that I even, like use the VA website. I feel like, she asked me to provide this document. I sent it to her, and then she was able to, you know, do a lot of the heavy lifting.

**P5:**  3:57  
Sounds good. So I'm just thinking about who, or what was the biggest help in getting this process from end to end? That would be the loan manager that you were talking about? Were there any other people or any other things that were particularly helpful?

**P5:**  4:15  
Yeah, no, I mean, she was definitely the key there. And I think with her, like, I think they like specialize and, you know, loans with veterans, and so they just have a lot of experience with it. So it was a very easy process.

**P5:**  4:33  
That sounds good. We've actually heard that quite a bit is that of the people we've been talking to there. They've had good experiences, you know, and in the big wide world, you think Home Buying is not always the easiest thing in the world, but so far, so good with people we've talked to. Yeah. So Well, with that in mind. And knowing that it did go pretty well and that you were removed from that scenario. Was there anything instruct us like, Well, that was easier that went really well. What would you say was like the easiest best part of that process?

**P5:**  5:10  
And it's hard to, I guess specify one thing. I feel like the whole whole process was really was really pretty simple. For me, I think what? Because I've, I've read every finance sense, and I think it's trying to figure out kind of what the rules are with that, because I know, you're only able to be approved for a certain amount. And I think it was unclear to me if I could have two loans that are VA backed or just one kind of at a time on something. I've been trying to figure out, I guess, okay.

**P5:**  5:56  
Yeah, I wouldn't want to give you my take on that offhand. Because I'm afraid I'd be wrong. But I believe that the the info for that is, I think it's available on one of the one Yeah, yeah. So all right. All right. Well, so things went pretty well. end to end, and nothing really stood out. What about any issues or problems? Were there any snags in the process?

**P5:**  6:24  
Um, yeah, not? Not really. It was it was pretty smooth.

**P5:**  6:32  
Yeah, I think I think the biggest thing was, for me, it was just trying to make sure I had all the paperwork I needed sign and the power of attorneys figure it out. So that way, I could, you know, have this done without me physically being there on the day of.

**P5:**  6:49  
Okay, so really, your biggest problem is just not being in person. And you got through that with pra paperwork. And that,

**P5:**  6:57  
yeah, well, yeah. They had all the right power of attorneys, and I was able to find a notary out there.

**P5:**  7:06  
I don't even want to know where you might have found that person. Yeah. I'm sure. Okay. All right. Well, then, this is the last question that I've got about the the general home buying process. But do you remember there being any particular tools that you just couldn't do without something that was especially helpful? Or maybe easy to use that made this process go?

**P5:**  7:30  
For me? I not really, however, haftar gone through tap? i? Yeah. I mean, they they did explain everything pretty well. And I think using the benefit fit site has been good. But like you said, you guys are trying to emerge. And I think that would kind of simplify the process for that, like just having one central location for all this information and processes.

**P5:**  8:01  
Right. So thinking ahead, that so tap was was kind of helpful when it came to learning about the tools and the different things that you can do.

**P5:**  8:10  
Yes, yeah. You know,

**P5:**  8:12  
it's good to have that. Okay. I think we understand where that's go. So the next thing we're going to talk about, because this is the particular thing that we're moving, is the certificate of eligibility. Can you tell us what a certificate of eligibility what a CSV is?

**P5:**  8:28  
I, it's basically just something saying that the VA, I think, you know, says you are qualified for this benefit. So I need it for this, or I need it for like the GI Bill, saying like, Hey, this is what this particular person is qualified for.

**P5:**  8:48  
Okay. I think so quite well, in your, from what you remember, is it for anything in particular, because you've mentioned gi benefits, but the certificate of eligibility is for anything else that you can think of?

**P5:**  9:03  
Yeah, I mean, for the for the loan, I imagine that like for whatever benefit you're trying to use, you'd need a specific CLE for that one. Okay.

**P5:**  9:15  
So thinking back to the process, do you remember the point at which you got a CSV for your home loan?

**P5:**  9:23  
Honestly, I don't I like because I, as I signed in, I saw CSV, looked it up and I remembered the what I needed, I guess, to start to the application. And I remember getting that memo signed and everything but I don't remember specifically signing for it myself.

**P5:**  9:44  
Okay. So then really, you it was just part of the process and it was yet another piece of paper or something or another form. So you don't it doesn't stand out so you don't recall any challenges running into

**P5:**  9:58  
now. All right.

**P5:**  10:01  
Okay. Thinking just in general about a CI, do you have any idea with the requirements for SEO? We would be?

**P5:**  10:10  
me so I mean, your name and social? And then time of service? And then a signature from? Yeah, either commander or your s one. Okay.

**P5:**  10:30  
Mmm

**P5:**  10:32  
hmm. I've got a question about a detail on CSV, but you're not seeing a cure or having much recollection about it. I'm just gonna throw it out there and see if it rings a bell.

**P5:**  10:41  
Yeah, um,

**P5:**  10:42  
do you know anything about your funding fee? And your or your funding fee status that might show up on your CV? Does that ring a bell?

**P5:**  10:53  
It's not now.

**P5:**  10:56  
It's alright. No, that's fine. Actually, there are there's a lot of information to uncover in what people are not familiar with. Or they're not they haven't heard, because we, on our side, have our view of the process and the issues and the documents. But yeah, other people, we often find that, you know, they have a different perspective. So, yeah, that's fine. It's not a problem. If you don't, that you're not familiar with it. And given the fact that you were, you know, out there downrange, and, you know, doing this stuff. I imagine you had other things to worry about.

**P5:**  11:30  
Yeah, I was, yeah, I was pretty pleased with the overall process. The fact that I was able to buy the house while there and then just come back, and move right into the house was pretty nice.

**P5:**  11:43  
That is kind of amazing. Right there.

**P5:**  11:45  
Yeah. Um,

**P5:**  11:46  
do you recall any other documentation that you had to have? You said, you mentioned a letter, you thought you saw CSV somewhere in the process? Is there anything else that you had to provide to the lender? Or to anybody to get the whole month through the process?

**P5:**  12:04  
Um, specifically for the VA? I'm not sure. But obviously, I know, I needed those power of attorneys, I think, right, we're probably the biggest hurdle I needed to get over.

**P5:**  12:21  
Now, in terms of hurdle in providing these documents, in terms of how you had to give this documentation, was there, how did you do what websites were you? Did you have to send a courier?

**P5:**  12:36  
Um, I think I just I scanned most things. So if it was something that I had to get physically signed, I would just scan it to them and then send it via email. Or, or they might have had a portal, where I uploaded it to and then for a lot of the actual signature stuff, I think DocuSign was was how I signed a lot of things over there.

**P5:**  13:03  
Okay, yeah. And that's, that's a pretty popular tool stateside, too. So you know, a lot of people not not wanting to go or expedite the process. DocuSign is something I believe they use here. So that's, that's good. So you didn't run into any particular problems with that getting physical stuff signed? uploaded? email sent her DocuSign?

**P5:**  13:26  
Nothing. Now, it was all pre Smith.

**P5:**  13:29  
All right. Do you know anything about other CSV options is if you had to maybe tell somebody, hey, you need to get to see we try this or this? Do you know what options there are for getting a certificate of eligibility?

**P5:**  13:46  
Um, no, I mean, if if active duty, you know, probably give the information that you have, or some sort of sort of orders to kind of prove your service that you're eligible. And then if you're out of the military, I assume if you just have your dd 214, and you're able to give a copy of that, that should write documentation.

**P5:**  14:09  
If you had to go and find one and fill it out yourself. Where would you start?

**P5:**  14:17  
I'd probably I'd probably start@va.gov and then find that particular spot and then just kind of let it lead me there, which probably would be to the benefits page right now.

**P5:**  14:33  
Okay. All right. The last thing we're going to talk about is just kind of general tools and features. So you've mentioned va.gov, and you mentioned the benefits. So thinking about VA websites that are out there, what experiences good or bad, come to mind about managing your benefits.

**P5:**  14:55  
Um,

**P5:**  14:57  
yeah, I think I think But they harp on the most during tap was just making sure you have that DS login. Okay, and getting that early, and then making sure you kind of maintain that. So you're able to access it once you don't have, you know, a cat card to get into these websites. So that's, um, so that's good. I, for me, I had, I did the DNS login. So long ago, when I went back to login, I forgot what picture I use. So I had to do some really deep thinking to try to remember what picture that was

**P5:**  15:37  
the security picture that comes up.

**P5:**  15:39  
Yeah, ah,

**P5:**  15:40  
yeah. Well, it's it's a 21st century problem. logins and stuff. Right? Yeah. Okay, so managing your password and logins and stuff like that. That's, that's something it could be problematic. Have you used the site's for anything and run into any issues yet? Or is it you're just at the kind of the awareness level now.

**P5:**  16:04  
Um,

**P5:**  16:04  
I think more the awareness level now, like, I haven't dug too deep, I've looked a little bit at the like disability rating. But I think I'm gonna go physical mail for that, because I've been working with a, I guess, a consultant for that. And she suggests using the physical mail. And then I've also been looking at the GI Bill benefits. Haven't haven't applied for the cod yet. Because I think I need to wait until I'm actually off active duty to make sure that I get all the benefits for like the bH. But I know the school that I'm going to they like have an office that is dedicated to that. And they'll be able to help me

**P5:**  17:01  
through that process. Yeah, a lot of schools. Yeah, have veterans offices where and they deal with your day in day out so they can lead you through. So that's good. Okay. All right. So just kind of back to thinking about the loan process in general. Is there anything that we could do to make that process simpler for you? It sounds like you had a pretty easy go of it. But can you think of something that, you know, you wished were easier?

**P5:**  17:41  
Not not off the top of my head? I mean, I think I think it's pretty simple. Like I can easily Google, like the, you know, VA Home Loans, it'll take me right to the page that kind of talks me through the different loan types, and how to use it and how to figure out if you're eligible. And I think, you know, anyone can really kind of navigate through that and figure it out. Pretty well, it seems pretty well spelled out.

**P5:**  18:15  
Sounds good. So see you he was pretty simple. It's kind of integrated home buying process seems like it went pretty well. You would, you know, do Google searches if you needed to kind of figure things out. So you kind of got through it that way. I Well, I guess when your situation you didn't have to do much of that. I think it was you were just kind of led by the hand and taken through the process by the person you've mentioned. The last question I've got then is maybe just it's kind of like a hypothetical. if somebody were to come to you and go, Hey, you got a VA loan? And there's this sci fi thing? What sort of advice? Would you give that person? What would you tell them about how to go forward trying to get a VA loan?

**P5:**  19:00  
Yeah, I mean, yeah, obviously, I tell them kind of the benefits of having a VA loan, and then I would say, I would, I would kind of tell them to do their research on va.gov. And then try to find a good a good, you know, loan manager that that has experienced and kind of kind of help you through the process. Yeah, definitely. That

**P5:**  19:27  
seems to work pretty well for you. And we've heard that from other people, too, is that finding somebody who's been there before is one of the biggest help.

**P5:**  19:34  
Yeah. Okay.

**P5:**  19:36  
Well, I've pretty much covered everything that I've got on the list. And I know we started late, but it looks like we're pretty close to on time. So is there anything else that you would like for us to know about va.gov for VA benefits in general, that we can take away and maybe right up in some of the findings

**P5:**  19:59  
um,

**P5:**  20:01  
No, I mean, it's it's really I think, you know, spelt out pretty well. I mean, you go on the homepage and you see like it's broken down pretty easy right there figuring out how to get your ID cards, education, health care disability. It's kind of all right there.

**P5:**  20:25  
So it sounds like you'd like the way the homepage is laid out with all the benefits and, and the organization and all the different links that take you straight to things.

**P5:**  20:33  
Is that right? Yeah. Yeah, I think just, I think that kind of interface thing is extremely helpful. And the easier it is to kind of read and the simpler is like, oh, housing assistance, let me just click here and it'll take me you know, kind of right to what you know, what I'm looking for think that the simpler it is, the better. So having, I think a homepage, that boom has it all right there and so you're not clicking as much reverses, you know, it being hidden under tabs. And then now I'm like, Alright, which tab is the Sunder? I found? I just saw it. Okay, now I move my mouse and it's gone or whatever. I think it just being there on the webs on the site just makes it a little bit simpler for people to find things.

**P5:**  21:24  
That sounds good. So the takeaway there is keep things simple and step by step and direct links.

**P5:**  21:32  
Yeah, good.

**P5:**  21:34  
Okay. Well, that's pretty much all I've got for this morning. And I really appreciate you joining us and letting us know how that whole loan process went for and I'm glad it went so well, so smoothly, especially with you deployed.

**P5:**  21:47  
Yeah, no, no, I appreciate them. Happy to be here. All right. Well, thank

**P5:**  21:52  
you so much.

**P5:**  21:55  
Thanks, have a great day.

**P5:**  21:56  
You too. Bye. Bye. Bye.
