**P6:**  0:00  
Okay, do I have your permission to record this session?

**P6:**  0:03  
Yes, you do.

**P6:**  0:04  
Thank you. Okay. To start out, if you could tell us a little bit about yourself, you know, maybe just in general, your experiences with VA, service history, something like that.

**P6:**  0:19  
I served three years in the Army Reserves from 2003 to 2006. Okay. And then I went to active duty from 2006 to 2010. I got out in 2010. And as far as use of VA services, I have used my VA home loan. And I have also used my education benefits, but I have not used any of you healthcare services.

**P6:**  0:52  
Okay.

**P6:**  0:53  
Well, I hope that's because you're very healthy, and you don't need them.

**P6:**  0:56  
Yes, it is.

**P6:**  0:58  
Very good. Okay, so you'd mentioned that you applied for a VA back one on before, can you describe to us what that process was, like, with the VA and even outside of what the VA was involved with?

**P6:**  1:11  
It was in 2015. So it was a few years ago, I don't remember if I had to email somebody to get my certificate of eligibility, or if it was just something I could do online and have it kind of automatically sent to me. But I don't remember it being an issue. So it must not have been too hard. One thing that I think would have been helpful, and I don't know if it's changed, is just kind of having like an informational, like PowerPoint or tutorial and the VA home loan. I know I personally did a lot of research on it. But kind of explaining the funding fee. And that the VA is not providing you with money, they are just backing, you know, the the mortgage from a traditional.

**P6:**  2:10  
Okay, loan. Right. So you're, it would be good if you had maybe something to clarify some of these points a little more specifically. And so, PowerPoint or, you know, for us, we're working on websites, we have some limitations when it comes to producing that sort of material, but certainly take into account that information, maybe we can produce a page or some other resource with that. That's good. So going back to the the process, you know, and your involvement with the lender and getting the home. How did that go?

**P6:**  2:46  
It was fine. I ended up using a going through a program, I think it was like homes for heroes or something like that, where they actually provided you with a lender and a realtor. And the only issue that I had with that was that the only realtor that I had access to through that program was not local. So she wasn't familiar with kind of real estate in my area, which was challenging, but it worked out I found a house. And that had nothing to do with the VA. Right. But I think just having people where that those programs are out there, but also to do research on them, because not all of them are ready. Right?

**P6:**  3:34  
Yeah, that is that's good feedback. I mean, we do want to know about, you know, where, where you worked with VA on things, but to also know, just in general terms of what the situation was like, it gives a lot of context. So that's fine as we go forward. It doesn't have to do with VA, if something comes in comes to mind. So it sounds like you you were involved with a, you know, a program focused on Veterans and real estate and home loans. What What was your decision in going with them versus just going maybe straight to a lender?

**P6:**  4:08  
Um, a lot of it was because they had grants to cover closing costs.

**P6:**  4:15  
Okay.

**P6:**  4:17  
So that saved me some money. But I also made sure that with that lender that their rates were competitive, and I wasn't making sacrifices in other areas to save a couple of $1,000 on closing costs,

**P6:**  4:32  
right? Sounds like you're pretty good researcher too. So you just want to wait that in, in the balance. I'm thinking about the whole loan application process from start to finish. What what went especially well, in that process, was there anything that was surprisingly good?

**P6:**  4:50  
Um,

**P6:**  4:52  
I think just kind of how easy it was it. The whole home buying process is pretty long and complex. cated but working with a VA working with a lender. There was always somebody there to answer my questions and to help me find information or documents that I needed.

**P6:**  5:16  
We have, we've heard that pretty consistently, that the home buying experience was kind of long, it's gone pretty well for most people. And that's good. That's really good. Was there any particular person or any particular tool or thing that was like the biggest help in getting you through the process?

**P6:**  5:36  
Um,

**P6:**  5:40  
I wouldn't say my realtor, she was just willing to go above and beyond with providing me with information of like, first time home buying classes, things like that. And she lived about an hour and a half away from me. So her having to travel down for showings and stuff I know wasn't necessarily easy for her.

**P6:**  6:08  
Well, that sounds like Yeah, it definitely sounds like above and beyond. And it sounds like she was a good resource for other, you know, like educational programs or other information?

**P6:**  6:19  
Definitely. Good.

**P6:**  6:21  
Now, thinking on the other side, and problems and issues that you ran into with the home buying process was, were there any stumbling blocks, anything comes to mind that we that didn't go well.

**P6:**  6:33  
Um,

**P6:**  6:35  
one thing that I would say was a challenge was that with a program I did decide to go to, they hadn't thoroughly read all of my documents. So they thought I was eligible for more grand than I actually was. I was in the process of getting a divorce. So I was only using my income as proof that I could, you know, afford the mortgage. So they thought that because it was just based off of my income, I would be eligible for more grants. However, me being married, technically, at the time meant that I was not because there was additional income in the household, even though technically even though that I wasn't using that. Right. So that was kind of a stumbling block, but it worked out.

**P6:**  7:33  
Okay. So basically, you finally got past it, just working through the problem and saying, hey, look, here it is, and pointed out the how they were looking at the intro.

**P6:**  7:42  
Right. Okay.

**P6:**  7:45  
Were there any other problems besides that, that you ran into in the home buying process?

**P6:**  7:51  
I don't think so. No?

**P6:**  7:53  
Well, again, that's good. We're not looking for problems, we want to, it's good to hear that people are good experiences. So far, I'd say probably five out of five, it's been that way. So that's great. Okay, so let's talk a little bit then about the certificate of eligibility, you said that you don't remember exactly how you did it, you know, whether it was email, or you going to a website. But in terms of what a certificate of eligibility is, can you tell us what that is,

**P6:**  8:27  
but from my understanding, it just shows that through the VA, you're eligible for them to back your home loan, that you did the required service, and that they're providing that financial insurance, so you don't have to pay the the private mortgage insurance, like original loan if you don't have that 20% down.

**P6:**  8:56  
So you know, specifically that there's no money involved, it's just the degree to which they'll back you you had mentioned, and you've done all the research on that. So you know, some of the details. You actually even knew you brought up some one of the things that I was gonna ask about funding fee. That's kind of a detailed question and strong a lot of blanks from people but so you, you know, funding fee status is an item on the on the CSV. It's important. Excuse me, do you know why that it's an important number or an important status?

**P6:**  9:31  
I know that it is money that is added on to your loan, and that it's different depending on whether it's your first time using your VA loan, how much money down you're having, or your disability rating, but that's about all I know about it.

**P6:**  9:50  
Oh, well, like I said, you know, the fact that you even heard of it. A lot of people like said we're drawing blank. So that's it's important. I'm going back to do The CSV and and generally what it is, do you know you'd mentioned some other requirements? Do you know more detail about what the requirements are for receiving a certificate of eligibility?

**P6:**  10:13  
I do not.

**P6:**  10:15  
Okay. But you just know that you went through the process pretty easily. And so you met all their requirements?

**P6:**  10:23  
Yeah. Okay.

**P6:**  10:26  
And then you don't recall how you got the certificate of eligibility. So it sounds like it was pretty simple. You don't recall any sort of questions or hiccups or difficulties in getting at do?

**P6:**  10:40  
No, I don't. Okay.

**P6:**  10:45  
Thinking about? Well, and if you don't remember how you got to see it, we wouldn't really recall it. There was documentation. I've got one of the questions about documentation provided for CSV. Let's just generalize that a little bit and talk about documentation in general. Do you recall any issues with having to provide VA or the lender documentation for your VA loan? It could be just anything dd 214, or anything like that?

**P6:**  11:15  
Um, I don't in particular, I'm assuming like with the VA, they have all my information, they had all the information already from applying for the GI Bill. So I'm assuming that I didn't have to really send in any additional documentation.

**P6:**  11:31  
You don't recall anybody asking and saying, hey, you need to give us a XYZ. Now. Okay. All right. In terms of a CSV, are you aware of any other options for how to get one? You said, maybe you sent an email? Or maybe you applied online? Do you know of any other ways that a person could get a CMP? Or veteran could get a CMP?

**P6:**  11:55  
Um,

**P6:**  11:58  
no, I'd say either directly contacting VA, maybe via phone or email. Otherwise, there's probably some way through the VA website to kind of automatically request one and habit generated, I'm assuming, but that's about it.

**P6:**  12:14  
Okay. All right. So if let's say you were going through the process again, and you're like, Okay, somebody says, I need to see a way what would your steps be at this point? Because you had said, Maybe you'd get on the phone, but just thinking more specifically about you? What would your next steps be in trying to find out about a certificate of eligibility or and or applying for one,

**P6:**  12:36  
I would probably use Google and search flight, Veterans Affairs, Home Loan certificate of eligibility, and make sure that whatever I am looking for is actually on the VA like.gov. website. It is reputable.

**P6:**  12:57  
Right. Yeah. You had mentioned before that scammers or disreputable people were looking to take advantage of people trying to get home loans. is a good idea. Do you know of anybody that has had that sort of issue. Anything come to mind about disreputable people coming in trying to take advantage or trying to redirect you get your business?

**P6:**  13:26  
I don't personally know any buddy that I would say was scammed. I do know that some places have just higher interest rates. They're not anything outrageous, but it really does pay off for people to research on their own. Lenders, right, and everything that goes into it.

**P6:**  13:52  
Gotcha. So they they flash, you know, VA Home Loans, and then kind of up the rates a little bit so they can make right or

**P6:**  13:59  
they don't advertise that there's points associated with it or things like that.

**P6:**  14:03  
Alright, so settle things like that. Okay. That is, that is one of the other things that we've run into in some of the discussions we've had is that make sure that you do get the best rate first and foremost. So that is very important. That's the bottom line. So we're going to move on then, to just talk about in general, use some VA websites and the tools that we have. You mentioned va.gov and that you would pull some you'll do a lot of research. So what sort of experiences have you had with VA websites, good and bad, particularly trying to manage your benefits.

**P6:**  14:44  
I have had mixed with a VA website. I do know that if I my e benefit, nothing works. It hasn't worked for years. I can't Like access documents on there, every time I try and log in, I just get a message, an error message. So I generally use the phone or email services to get things done that I need done. Another problem that I seem to have is that not everything is always consolidated or super easy to find. There'll be like, you can find a main page about the post 911 GI Bill, say. And then if you're looking for other additional resources through the VA related to that, it'll take you to a different page to a different page to a different page. And then it's hard to kind of find exactly what you had been looking for, again, if you're trying to find that same information. But the information is there, you just have to look for it, which is great.

**P6:**  16:01  
So there are a couple of things. It sounds like on the one side, and I'm going to guess was that va.gov? You're talking about when there's like page after page of information? Yeah. Okay. So it sounds like you just have a lot of click throughs. And a lot of links to go from here to here to here to be able to collect all that information. How would you How would you rather get that information,

**P6:**  16:25  
maybe just have, like, a main page for the topic. And then on, like the left hand side, you can do a drop down menu with links to different areas about it. Instead of just like, click through the different pages, like there's another link on the next page, and then there's more links on the next page, just have it all consolidated in one place. Okay.

**P6:**  16:55  
I think I understand. So some sort of overview. And then pages devoted to details. Right, Y chromosome. Okay. Now, that's good feedback. Now, you also mentioned he benefits and I had to laugh because we're working on the benefits. And I know what a little bit of what you're going through, because I go through it too. When I take a look at the site. You say it doesn't work, and it hasn't worked? Was there a point at which it did work for you? And what to do on the benefits, so it's never worked for me? Alright, so your only recourse is if the benefits is is your option is to pick up the phone. Is that right? Yes. Okay, well, that is part of what we're trying to do is to retire, he benefits for reasons you're talking about other reasons and move those things over. So there is a CSV feature on there that if you can't get into it you've never seen. So that's what we're working on specifically. But we're also working on some other things. So hopefully, fingers crossed, within another year or so we'll be retiring that site, and everything will be on va.gov. And we'll be improving it from there. So just to give you a kind of a sense of what to expect. So you've not used? Or have you used VA websites for either researching or any other step in online processes.

**P6:**  18:21  
i.

**P6:**  18:25  
So, what did you do to? or What were you looking for when you were using the VA sites?

**P6:**  18:34  
Probably with the home loans, just general information about them. For the home buying process, you know, starting out, I wasn't aware, you know, that, again, the money wasn't coming from the VA. They were just backing a banking institution that you got a mortgage for things like that, the fees associated with it, how to go about using it getting the certificate of eligibility, just kind of information on the entire process. Okay,

**P6:**  19:09  
so you didn't really use it for any of the tools that might have been there used it for research and for information.

**P6:**  19:15  
Correct. Okay.

**P6:**  19:17  
Well, what was your experience? Was that was it a good experience? Did you find what you were looking for? Um,

**P6:**  19:22  
I would say yes, I feel like I have a lot more information now about VA loans than I did going into it.

**P6:**  19:31  
And it's good to know. Okay. Now, now that you're a homeowner, and you've gone through the process, and you've got the loan. And looking back, you'd mentioned a couple of things that you wish you had known or you You didn't know that you found out, of course, is there anything at this point that you can think of that, gee, if I had just known this, it would have been great or would have made things better?

**P6:**  19:57  
Um,

**P6:**  20:00  
I would say no. But if there was one thing, I would have stressed myself, I would tell people not just to look at, like interest rates when they are in the home buying process and trying to find a lender. but to also look, look at the fees associated the closing costs. If they're purchasing points, things like that, and to sometimes find a local lender. I'm sure like realtors, a lot of them suggest local lenders that they regularly work with. But I actually refinance this here and had a horrible time with Navy Federal, and ended up two months end of that just sign them to cancel everything. And what was the local lender, and it was not just a lot easier, and they were able to get it done in 30 days, where maybe further ahead, just mess things up in two months, and it hadn't even started. But the closing costs were less than half. And the interest rates were lower. So really just doing research on lenders, and what they have to offer, even if they might not be a big name in industry,

**P6:**  21:30  
that's definitely a good thing to keep in mind, just in general, because that's ultimately what the home buying process is all about. would you expect VA to give advice or guidance on lenders or, you know, maybe the fine points of how to find good rates is that

**P6:**  21:51  
I think that would be really helpful. I would not expect them to kind of advertise or use specific lenders, but just tips on what to look for and what to compare. Maybe say, Hey, you know, there's a lot of lenders have a thing where you can just put in, put your information online, and they'll give you a quote right away, maybe compare at least three things like that.

**P6:**  22:18  
Okay, so just like general guidance versus anything specific. Okay, that's good. I do have a question about what we could do to make cod simple. But you don't recall. Having gone through that process, it was apparently pretty simple for you. So we'll we'll talk a little bit more about the home buying process. Is there any thing in the VA is involvement in the home buying process that can make things simpler? Anything you can think of?

**P6:**  22:49  
I really don't think so. It really seems like the VA is part is just to really provide that to do get of eligibility. So that you can get a VA loan through. Okay, and institution.

**P6:**  23:07  
So they're they're part of the process worked pretty well for you and go back to your your original step by step it went through pretty quickly, pretty easily.

**P6:**  23:17  
It did.

**P6:**  23:18  
Okay, good. Well, then, just talking once more about that, the whole process, if somebody were to come to you and go, Hey, you just went through, you know, buying home, maybe not so much the refinancing, because it sounds like that was problematic, but the initial buy? What sort of advice would you give to that person? You had mentioned interest rates and shopping around? Is there anything else you could tell them about the process itself to you know, learn from what I did?

**P6:**  23:46  
I would say that those are the really big things. And also just to consider the local market, I know where I am right now, a lot of homes are selling for quite a bit more than appraised value. So just for especially for active duty, if you're going to be leaving in a couple years, just to consider that you might not want to throw an extra $30,000 out of pocket at something that you might not, you might be losing money on and

**P6:**  24:22  
that would definitely be good advice that's on the financial side. That's definitely really good advice. Okay, well, that's pretty much all that I've got in terms of the questions on my list. So before we wrap up, is there anything else that you would like to let us know about va.gov benefits management or your experiences with VA? No, I

**P6:**  24:46  
don't think so.

**P6:**  24:48  
Okay, well, I really appreciate your time and taking us through your experience on the VA loan and I'm glad everything went super fast, super easy, you know until the refi but Yeah, that CSV it sounds like it was an invisible process to you, which I think is about as good as things can get. So, thank you so much for your time. And I think we are done at this point.

**P6:**  25:15  
Great. Thank you Have a great afternoon.

**P6:**  25:18  
Yep, you too. Thank you. Bye bye.
