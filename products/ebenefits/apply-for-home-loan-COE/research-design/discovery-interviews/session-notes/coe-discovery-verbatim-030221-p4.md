## Warm-up
**M:** Okay, for the record, Do I have your permission to record this session?

**P4:** Yes, sir.

**M:** Great. I appreciate that. Alright, to start out with, if you wouldn't mind telling us just a little bit about yourself. I understand that you are a veteran and that you are a veteran caretaker. Could you tell us a bit about your maybe your

**P4:** I joined the service in between my junior and senior year of high school 1979. Left which basic training in March of 80 did my a it came home to Southern southern Indiana, and I wanted to be active duty. So I went active duty for their got out in 95. Desert Storm veteran my husband and I have gotten together to fly 2018 we got married in November of 2018. He is a special forces combat veteran. For my rack. I got my certificate of eligibility. Do I could buy a house? And I finally closed on the house in January of 2014.

## Section one: The loan process
**M:** Oh, okay. So it's, um, it's relatively recently. So that's good. So you have applied for and received a VA loan, you've gone through the process. So there's that that puts you in a good spot to be able to talk about this feature that we're looking at here. So you had applied for the VA back loan? Do you remember how that process went? Can you kind of outline for us the steps that you went through to get that loan? A general,

**P4:** went online, found the form, pulled it out, submitted it with a copy of my dd 214. Okay. And it sent me the paper and my dd 214 back showing that I was eligible.

**M:** Alright, so you're talking about looking online, and you found out the form for the certificate of eligibility? Yes, sir. Is that? Okay? All right. I'm trying to remember offhand what the number that is. I think it's an 1880. So you just basically. Oh, no, that's fine. No worries at all. All these numbers run together. So you printed off the form, filled it out, and then sent it in? Is that the steps in your process?

**P4:** Yes, sir.

**M:** He's using the US mail.

**P4:** Okay. Yes, sir.

**M:** All right. Um, so as far as the rest of the loan process, can you describe for us how how that went?

**P4:** I found the property I wanted was told that I would be back to a certain amount. And so whenever I found the property, it was submitted to the government to how much the property was they agreed that that was a good price for it. They sent a gentleman out to inspect. And at first, she did not agree with the inspection.

**M:** Okay,

**P4:** state of Florida, you have to have air conditioning.

**M:** It's important.

**P4:** And the aircon, your chair didn't work. I had been hit by lightning. So they had to put a whole new system in. And then after that, it was approved and my lung went through and I got my property.

**M:** Okay, that sounds good in in big terms, just in, in general thinking about the process. So would you say that it went really well. Were there any problems that you ran into that you remember? From the time

**P4:** I bed in time we closed with less than two months?

**M:** That sounds like it went pretty well then. So you don't recall any big stumbling blocks or any any issues or problems that kind of derailed things?

**P4:** No chair because there was already a stove in the house. Because that's also something for the the loan agreement for the VA is that there has to be someplace to cook you do not have to have any place to keep your food cold. Because you can go to the store every day and by your feet have to have some way of cooking.

**M:** Okay, so that was a VA requirement from what you remember that the VA requirement.

**M:** Yeah, it seems like every house should kind of come with a place to cook food but I think that's the first I've heard that the VA requires it. So I appreciate that feedback. Do you remember anything that went particularly? Well, something that was surprising, like, Oh, that was easy.

**P4:** Getting much of eligibility.

**M:** Okay, so you found that to be actually pretty easy?

**P4:** Yes, sir. Good.

**M:** Okay. And then just in terms of any single big problem that you ran into, you mentioned that the inspector said, Hey, the AC has been hit by lightning. Okay. So that's, that's one thing that you've mentioned, Was there another problem with the lender, or the process that you can remember, that kind of stopped things.

**P4:** Um, when I was getting the property mice, I was with a gentleman that was a Vietnam veteran, we were not married. And because we were not married, or because we were not a couple of things act, right. We could not go on the loan together. I had better credit. So when in my name, and when we made the closing cost and payment and all of that stuff, I had to prove to them that he had went to his bank took out a certain amount of money and gave it me, you pay on closing costs. Gotcha. Because I had to be able to show exactly where every penny of my money went.

**M:** Okay, so it sounds like the the, just the big issue that you had to go through was justifying what you know, some of the money that you have for closing costs, and just the length these sound like lenders requirements to me. So you ran into a little bit of a problem with that. Is that right? So what

**P4:** No, it was actually the VA, or the VA did require this,

**P4:** the VA required me to be able to show that I was going to be able to make my monthly payment, okay, and want to know how I got my my down payment and payment, I'm sorry, I had I didn't have put down payment, my closing costs and all the inspection fees and, and that stuff, they want to know where I got all that money from.

**M:** Okay, so the VA made that requirement. Yes. Asking about the I'm asking about the lender at this point. Did you work with a lender who was familiar with veterans and VA loans?

**M:** The lender? Yes.

**P4:** I guess it'd be like an outsourcing company. Lady. No, she really wasn't familiar with that. She studied up on on what needed to be done and everything. And within a week, she was a power.

**M:** Okay. So she wasn't familiar at first, but she went looked up everything. And then she was she pretty much had all the answers after spend a little time and she was good with it at that point.

**P4:** Yes, sir. Because it was a national company that I was going through for my loan. She did work for them. Okay.

**M:** So going back to the just this general home buying process, you mentioned that you went online and you searched found the form, you filled it out. Were there any other tools, whether they're online or any other forms of paperwork, anything else that was especially helpful, or anything that was easy made the process easy for you?

**P4:** Oh, follow following the instructions online, how to fill the form out and who to get it to.

**M:** Okay, so the form you're talking about here is that's the CSV again.

**P4:** Yes, sir. Okay, so

**M:** the online directions for the form itself, we're, we're easy.

**P4:** We're clear, sir.

## Section two: COE
Unknown Speaker  8:34  
Good. Okay. Well, we have talked quite a bit about CSV already. Um, I've got another section of questions where we're going to talk a little bit more detail about that. So you can you describe for us what that certificate of eligibility is, and how it's used.

**P4:** You submit to get your certificate when you receive it, it will tell you how much the government will back you all alone.

**P4:** Sometimes it depends on what your disability rating is. Sometimes that depends on how long you served. Now, there's all these different formulas they used to come up with it. Mine, they would back me $250,000. And the property that I was asked for was 190,000. And when they saw what the property looked like and everything, they went ahead and boosted mine up to 190,000 so they back home long.

**M:** Okay, well, that's kind of interesting. We've talked to a couple of people about this. You're the first that's had an experience where you've been able to use the CSV and kind of negotiate a, you know, a bigger backing Can you just tell us a little bit about what that process was like? Who did you talk to? or How did you get that that 150 to go to 190,

**P4:** there was a phone number on the tip, or with the letter with CSV, that explain that whenever you found the property wanted to contact them. And that's what I did was I gave them the, the property description and where the property addresses. And they looked it up to see what value of it was to make sure it was worth what we're backing. Okay. I know they have went up as far as $360,000. On some places, I didn't need that much.

**M:** Okay. So you mentioned just in the course of talking about certificate of eligibility, that there are some requirements. Yes. So you know, what those requirements are, and they were clear, can you describe some of those to us? Um, you did say, service history,

**P4:** service history being able to produce a DDP 14. Okay, I'm having a good, good, decent credit, credit history not being in default for the government not being in default on other foreclosure somewhere. If you'd already had a government loan eligibility. Okay. You've paid it off before you applied for another one. About a month ago? Wow.

**M:** Yeah, that's, that's actually pretty good recall for something that happened six years ago. I had trouble with last week, quite a bit of the time. Okay. Well, I appreciate your your insight on that one. I have a question that we're asking. We're looking for a particular detail. On the CSV, there's funding fee status. Do you know why that's important? And why it's on there?

**P4:** Yes, sir.

**M:** Okay. Have you heard of funding fee or your funding fee status? Is that even? Okay? So you had mentioned that you're a DD 214? Did you have to provide that as documentation? And what other documentation Do you recall having to provide for the put alone or for CLE

**P4:** such carry number might copy my security card, even though it was on my dd 214. And that's the only thing I can think of. Okay, so seeing it, as the process went on, and I had to give them bank account numbers and that stuff, so they could verify what I was showing you my income was my output was,

**M:** okay. So you're talking about providing that information to VA, not necessarily the lender, because I know the lenders got their their requirements as well. Okay, for CSV, then it sounds like you just had dd 214 on the list for that. Social, okay. In terms of how you got the the CSV of you're the first person that we've we've run into who's actually gone, looked at the form, pulled it out and sent it on that way. And it sounds like that process worked pretty well for you. Are you aware of any other options any other way to get a certificate of eligibility?

**P4:** Oh, I'm Carrie, you're a veteran service officer.

**M:** Okay,

**P4:** good. You're through your county or through your your veterans organizations. Probably the library, we'd be able to help you find them. Your county clerk may be able to. My thing is, is I have PTSD. I don't like being around people. Okay, so it was easier for me to go on and find it myself.

**M:** Hmm. And it sounds like it worked pretty well. That's kind of interesting. The library. I didn't think of that. But they, they often are really good about finding forums. So that's, that's good insight on that.

**P4:** It will help you find forums and they don't charge you $1 a page to make a copy to give you Wow,

**M:** that is good.

**P4:** That's a page or a quarter or a page instead of like most businesses are $1 a page, right?

**M:** Yes, definitely. The businesses are gonna probably get as much as they can out of you. Okay, well, knowing what you know about SEO, he sounds like you've you've got a really good handle on it. And the process that you went through, is there anything that you could do differently in that SEO process or anything that would improve things make it better faster?

**P4:** If you could apply online, okay. But not everybody has a scanner where they be able to scan their dd 214 and stuff into in with the application


## Section three: tools and features
**M:** Okay, that yeah, that is a good point there. So if you had to have that dd 214, you needed to have some equipment to get it in. So maybe an online forum or an online tool. That is pretty much what we're looking at right here today is there's one on E benefits, we're going to be moving it over. So I appreciate the the input that you've got about documentation. We're going to scoot on to the final section that I've got, we're just going to talk about just VA websites and tools and some of the features have thinking about experience that you may have had with VA websites, or any websites having to do with VA information or forums, what experiences good experiences, and maybe some bad experiences have you had

**P4:** getting lost in the wormhole? As you go in looking for one thing, and like the day you'd be going in and looking for a letter for your benefit? Okay, I, you may have an E, E benefit, you may have to go to five or six different web pages to find that certificate. Okay, that letter, instead of it being first on the list, your certificate of disability, or you know, whatever your benefit or your difficut.

**M:** Okay, so it sounds like you, you have to do a lot of work to get to these documents.

**P4:** I'm sorry to say, I just turned 59 yesterday, and I'm not really computer literate. And people that are older than me have a lot more problems than I do on computer, though for him Frank find it would be a nightmare.

**M:** Yeah, we have, we've heard that we've run into that a couple of times. So that is your you're spot on with that. Um, so in terms of some of the bad experiences of trying to, you know, round up this information or find it or have to hunt for it? Are there any good experiences that you can think of online when managing your benefits? Anything that stands out?

**P4:** Oh, same thing be able to print off what a letter of benefit on the VA website itself, being able to order your medication, get in touch with your doctor if you have tests done being able to read your test results.

**M:** Okay. So are you talking about things that you've actually seen that are working for you are this is this more like what you would like to see what you're talking about?

**P4:** Those are things that work for me? 

**M:** Oh, good.

**P4:** Alright. So I have PTSD. I don't like being around people. So I can go on. And instead of having to go over to three R's or the walking clinic, I can get online and get a hold of my primary care doctor and say, Hey, this is what's going on. Do you think I need to be seen?

**M:** Okay. Are you talking about my health event?

**P4:** Yes. Okay.

**M:** Yep. Okay, now rings a bell for me. Thank you. So in general, looking at going through the loan process, and in VA websites in general, because of your particular situation, it sounds like you really prefer to do things online.

**P4:** So online on the telephone.

**M:** Okay. Well, thinking about that, then. Can you think of any any details or any sorts of things that we could put online that would make that process easy for you? Yeah, I'm thinking about the home loan process.

**P4:** If there's any way to do that, putting a link for the the local Veterans Service.

**M:** Okay. So you've mentioned a VSO a couple of times, like Florida has a county veteran's service officer,

**P4:** right. So that Oh, sure. Okay, sorry about my husband just got home the dog

**M:** Oh, not a problem. We want to make sure people don't just wander in. Alright, so you had mentioned a VSO Veteran Service Officer, and we've heard that before and we we've dealt with them, you know, over the time we've been working on on the site. What are your experiences working with a VSO maybe having to do with the home loan but anything in general?

**P4:** I didn't, I didn't work with them. For my disability, I did work with them. And one here and today. JOHN County, Florida is fantastic. They know their stuff. When I lived in Indiana, the gentleman that was VSO for county by county, Indiana couldn't find his button a wet paper bag.

**M:** Okay.

**P4:** He would I actually walked down the hallway from him and he would come to my office and asked me if I knew what form works. And I would I would find it for him and and print them off a copy of because he didn't he couldn't use the computer to do that.

**M:** Huh? All right. Well, it sounds almost like you were a deputy VSL right there?

**P4:** Well, it was he was he was the old boy system. They've been in the position for 30 something years and

**M:** Okay. All right. So you've had some good experiences with VSOs. And some of them really know what's going on? And then, you know, some not so good experiences. So that's Yes, sir. We run into that, too. There it is a little bit of a mixed bag. Generally, it seems that VSOs are pretty, pretty on top of things. But some others not so much. So if going back to the idea of VA back loans, or VA loans, just anything else that we might be able to do to make that whole process easier, whether it's online or in the real world.

**P4:** This may sound bad, but the places that have had to be foreclosed on by the veterans.

**M:** Okay.

**P4:** Make it where other veterans have first shot at them.

**M:** Okay,

**P4:** before before they go out to the public or banks.

**M:** Okay, that's actually pretty interesting. Yeah, that, that is some interesting insight, because we haven't heard anything like that. But it does seems like there'd be an advantage built in for veterans,

**P4:** I capital of friends that have went on the website, looking at the foreclosures and contacts out, and get told that it's open that anybody can bet on them. And by the time they get their stuff submitted, now, they've already been outbid by a bank or

**M:** right, I say, Okay, um, you are the first person who's brought that up. But that's the sort of stuff that we can surface and it may be outside our scope, but we can certainly put it in our analysis. And

**P4:** well, that's looking for brothers and sisters that way.

**M:** Exactly. I agree. Okay, a couple other questions before we wrap up? So knowing what you know, now, is there anything that you wish you knew beforehand, in the course of getting the CSV or going into the loan process? So you felt like it was pretty straightforward, and you had all the all your questions answered as you went?

**P4:** And if I ended up with a question, I drove people crazy, and I got an answer.

**M:** Okay. Sounds good. The CEO II process for us was our for you was was pretty simple. And we talked a little bit about, you know, how we can make that simpler. I'm trying to recall what you had said, maybe just you were talking about putting it online, putting that process online?

**P4:** Yes, putting it online, the only problem is people not everybody have as a scanner, right? or print for the again after they did online that they can print them a copy of their records. Right.

**M:** Okay. So anything else you could add to that? Anything? I mean, you talked about the scanner, maybe we can take that out of the equation, but is there anything else we could make that do to make that process simple?

**P4:** No, give anything?

**M:** All right. Sounds good. The last question I've got is knowing what you know about the process and it sounds like you've been in a position to kind of, you know, help other people through some of the VA benefits. What sort of advice would you give to somebody if they came to you and they said, you know, I'm thinking about a VA loan, what would you tell them?

**P4:** yet their eligibility before they have restarted anything?

**M:** Okay. Now, why would you say that? What is it about the CSV that makes makes that your first step?

**P4:** It makes it easier when you go looking for a loan because mom and pop banks don't handle. Government doesn't handle VA loans. They've got to find a bank or a financial company here. Handle VA loans. And if you don't have that certificate in hand already, they're gonna say, well, we can't talk to you. Okay? They want us, they want to see that certificate of eligibility before the big bang, and many people will talk to you. Right?

**M:** And you had mentioned before, it's got a lot of information, one says that you're eligible to gives you an amount. Yes, you're saying that should be your first step, get that in hand, and then you can talk to the lenders. Okay,

**P4:** yep, get that in hand, actually, even before you go out looking for what you're wanting to buy.

**M:** Okay, there you go.

**P4:** That way, you've already got it, you pick out. That was my case, I already had mine. I went out, found the place I wanted, put my bid in on it. And of course, they came back and said, Well, what kind of funding are you getting at a VA loan? Here's my certificate of eligibility.

**M:** Sounds good? Okay, well, that's the last question that I have about tools and features. And we're pretty close to time at this point. Is there anything else that you would like for us to know whether it's about loans, certificate of eligibility or any other VA benefits? Anything? Okay. Well, I really appreciate you taking the time to talk with us. And, you know, we're going to use your feedback. And we've got some interesting details, some things, insights that nobody else is has brought to our attention yet. We're going to take that we're going to try to make our tools as we migrate them over to va.gov. Even better, so I appreciate it. Thank you.

**P4:** Wonderful. Thank you so much. All right.
