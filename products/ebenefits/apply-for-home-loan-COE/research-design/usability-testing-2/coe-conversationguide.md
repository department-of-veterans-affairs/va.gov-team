### Project-specific setup
- [ ] n/a

## Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Candy and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. We're part of a team with the Department of Veterans Affairs that is moving some features of the old eBenefits site over to VA.gov. We're learning what veterans need to improve their online experience, and how we can make VA.gov more useful for you. Our focus today is the Certificate of Eligibility for VA-backed home loans.


Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
- **This entire session should take about 1 hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototypes and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 
*Start recording.*
- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes
Before we look at the website, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.
- Please tell us a little bit about yourself? Maybe start with your service experience...
- Have you applied for a VA-backed loan before?
- (If "yes") How did that go, what was your experience?
- (if "no") What do you know about VA home loan benefits?
- What do you know about a VA home loan Certificate of Eligibility?

## First Task: Wayfinding - 5 minutes
- **Please go to VA.gov.** link: [va.gov](https://www.va.gov/)
- **Now we're ready to start.** OK, now could you share your screen with us?
- Here's a scenario: you're looking to buy a new home and a lender said you could get a Certificate of Eligibility (COE) from VA.
- You heard there was a way on VA.gov to apply for a COE, where would you look for that?
- This is the actual home page; you're free to click on anything.

### Things to watch for:
- What is the user's thought process?
- What interactive elements does the user look for (e.g. menu, links, footer...)?
- What content/section does the user expect to find COE information and the form itself?
- Where does the user's search end? Do they make it to the COE landing page?

## Second Task: Complete 26-1880 - 10 minutes
- Okay, now let's move on to the prototype. link: [uxpin landing page](https://preview.uxpin.com/65c0623a799c268173fe1a3cb4375f9ce00ad820#/pages/137557312/simulate/no-panels?mode=cvhdmf)
- We'll be using made-up scenarios that may not really apply to you, and we're using test data in the prototype. 
- Nothing will be submitted because this is a prototype.
- I have a link in chat to the prototype we're testing; **please click on it.** (Clicks on prototype link to COE prototype)
- So we'll continue with what we said earlier: you're looking to buy a new home and your lender said you could get a Certificate of Eligibility on VA.gov.
- So you've come to this page; what do you do next?

### Follow-up questions - 5 minutes
- Once your COE is issued, how would you like to receive it?
- If you came back to VA.gov, where would you want that to be?
- How could we make things easier or more clear?
- If this was the actual VA.gov site, what would you do next?

### Things to watch for
- Do users find and use the "Find out about your VA home loan COE" action link?
- Where in the form flow do users stop or get confused?
- What language do participant find confusing?
- What additional info would help users and where?
- What information do participants expect on the confirmation screen?
- Do participants know what they should do next?
- Are users satisfied with the various avenues for following-up?

## Third Task: Pending with uploads requested - 5 minutes 
User returns to Check COE Status landing page and signs in to reveal [pending status with uploads requested](https://preview.uxpin.com/65c0623a799c268173fe1a3cb4375f9ce00ad820#/pages/140810030/simulate/no-panels?mode=cvhdmf)


Let's move on to our next task. We're going to imagine that some time has passed. You are now ready to proceed with your mortgage and want to download your COE.
I've put a new link in the chat. **Please click on it.**
- Take a look at this screen and describe what you see.
- (Participant signs-in) What just happened?
- What is your next step?
- Where would you go to find out what you need to upload.
- (Participant uploads document) What do you expect to happen now?

### Things to watch for:
- How quickly does the user determine they need to sign-in to see their status
- Do users understand they need to take action to follow up?
- Can users successfully use the upload tool?
- Do users see the letters?
- Do users want to download or save the letters?


## Fourth Task: Download existing COE - 5 minutes
User returns to Check COE Status landing page and signs in to reveal [available status](https://preview.uxpin.com/65c0623a799c268173fe1a3cb4375f9ce00ad820#/pages/139512694/simulate/no-panels?mode=cvhdmf)

Okay, so let's imagine that some more time has passed and you've returned to va.gov to get your COE.

I've put a new link in the chat. **Please click on it.**

- Take a look at this screen and describe what you see.
- (Participant signs-in) What just happened?
- What is your next step?
- If you left this page, what do you think would happen to your COE/link?

### Things to watch for:
- How quickly do users locate the "Download your COE" link?
- What do users expect will happen to the COE/link?
- Will the user look at their COE? How would they "save" it?


## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes
Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.
Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 
Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
