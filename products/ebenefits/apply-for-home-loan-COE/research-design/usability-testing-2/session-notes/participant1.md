## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes
Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.
- Please tell us a little bit about yourself? Maybe start with your service experience... I am a Gulf War Veteran, I am a sexual assault victim survivor, I have PTSD, I have a book written about my experience, and I am a social worker. Just trying to get my voice heard. 
- Have you applied for a VA-backed loan before? Yes, back in the day but I did not have the income. 
- (If "yes") How did that go, what was your experience? 
- (if "no") What do you know about VA home loan benefits?
- What do you know about a VA home loan Certificate of Eligibility? I do not know much now.

## First Task: Wayfinding - 5 minutes
 -	Please go to VA.gov.
 -	Now we're ready to start. OK, now could you share your screen with us? Let me see. Where does it say share your screen option? Share your contacts? Okay?
 -	Here's a scenario: you're looking to buy a new home and a lender said you could get a Certificate of Eligibility (COE) from VA.
 -	Where would you go to look for that? I would just Google and search for it. I wouldn’t go to VA.gov. If I were looking on VA.gov I would go to Menu and go to loans. There is a list of all the loans that are available. I like to talk to individuals when looking for something like this. If I clicked this one, I know I am not Native American so I know I would not qualify for that. I would go to purchase loan. Scrolls until she saw a link that said Certificate. I would go here and look through all the information and answer all these questions. 
 -	Do you think it gives you the information that you need? Yes, it has the information that it needs for me to know that I need to go there.
 -	You heard there was a way on VA.gov to apply for a COE, where would you look for that?
 -	This is the actual home page; you're free to click on anything.

## Second Task: Complete 26-1880 - 10 minutes
 -	Okay, now let's move on to the prototype.
 -	We'll be using made-up scenarios that may not really apply to you, and we're using test data in the prototype.
 -	Nothing will be submitted because this is a prototype.
 -	I have a link in chat to the prototype we're testing; please click on it. (Clicks on prototype link to COE prototype)
 -	So we'll continue with what we said earlier: you're looking to buy a new home and your lender said you could get a Certificate of Eligibility on VA.gov.
 -	So you've come to this page; what do you do next? I would read it, click on where it says I am a veteran, read how to request it, and then click on request it. Sign to start your request, I would click that and start it. I would request the certificate of eligibility. I would click continue. Continue. Continue. Continue. Do I need to select anything?
 -	Can you go back a couple of pages? Yes, I can. 
 -	Can you look at these questions and tell me what you think? I am a Veteran or previously activated, so I would pick that one. I would have to have a copy of my DD-214 on here so I would upload it.
 -	Show me what you would do if you had to upload it. I would click upload and select my DD-214 file. Would I need to upload another? It looks like something else is required. Unless I must upload something, I would think my DD-214 would qualify me. If I would actually be doing this, I would be confused because I would think my DD-214 would be good. I never heard of these other documents. I would stop and fill it out later when I called somebody to tell them I was stuck on the application. 
 -	Your DD-214 is all you need; you can continue with your form. Okay I would continue with the application. I would go to privacy policy and click here and continue. I would print it out. 

### Follow-up questions - 5 minutes
 -	Once your COE is issued, how would you like to receive it? Email would be fine.
 -	If you came back to VA.gov, where would you want that to be? No because it seems as if I was signed out somewhere. I think I would be able to log back in and find it. I would screenshot it.
 -	How could we make things easier or clearer? Some don’t have access to a print/email so having more options to save this would be great.
 -	If this was the actual VA.gov site, what would you do next? I would log out and go because it seems like I would just check my email.

## Third Task: Pending with uploads requested - 5 minutes
User returns to Check COE Status landing page and signs in to reveal pending status with uploads requested
Let's move on to our next task. We're going to imagine that some time has passed. You are now ready to proceed with your mortgage and want to download your COE. I've put a new link in the chat. Please click on it.
 -	Take a look at this screen and describe what you see. I would check my status. Sign in to check my status. We need more information from you. I would call somebody because I don’t know what other information they would need. I would also look through these links. Basically, I don’t have my birth certificate, so I would get my birth certificate and upload it on here. Upload a document and submit. That is what I would do.
 -	(Participant signs-in) What just happened?
 -	What is your next step?
 -	(Participant uploads document) What do you expect to happen now? About 5 days because that is what it said on the other site. I would say 5 business days. 
 -	You would come back to VA.gov or other communication on the status of this? I would hope they would email me to tell me the status. If not, I would come back on here to check, but we should get an email stating they did receive our documents.

## Fourth Task: Download existing COE - 5 minutes
User returns to Check COE Status landing page and signs in to reveal available status
Okay, so let's imagine that some more time has passed and you've returned to va.gov to get your COE.
I've put a new link in the chat. Please click on it.
 -	Take a look at this screen and describe what you see. I would download it. Scrolls through the site. I would check the notification letters. I would go here and download it and see if it comes up. Yes, that is what I would do. I would print it out or save it. 
 -	(Participant signs-in) What just happened?
 -	What is your next step?
 -	If you left this page, what do you think would happen to your COE/link? I would hope they would send me a copy of it through email or mail. Yes, I would forward it to my lender. 

### Things to watch for:
 -	How quickly do users locate the "Download your COE" link?
 -	What do users expect will happen to the COE/link?
 -	Will the user look at their COE? How would they "save" it?
