## Warm-up
- Please tell us a little bit about yourself. Maybe start with your service experience: I served for 20 years I retired in 2013. AS a first class it was the same time I did my claim. It took a little but I think it was due to backlog. Once done I got the back pay. I did have an issue where they hacked my information so I had to make sure. When I login to ebenefits is when I am at work and can login with CAC. 
- Have you applied for a VA-backed loan before? No not yet. 
- (if "no") What do you know about VA home loan benefits? 
- What do you know about a VA Certificate of Eligibility?
- What VA sites have you used in the past? What did you do there?

## Wayfinding
User screenshares / 5 minutes
- You heard there was a way on VA.gov to apply for a COE, where would you look for that? Download your benefit letters. How do I download a va letter. I would clock get adobe reader. I would download that. 
- Next step: I would sign in. 
- What would you except to find once signed in: Like the different percentage letters, theres a section with the summary letter, how much your percentage is and all of that. 
- Expect COE there: Yes. 

## Usability tasks
- For the purpose of this test, we'll continue with what we said earlier: you're looking to buy a new home and your lender said you needed a Certificate of Eligibility.

### Task 1 / Automatic COE scenario / 5 minutes
User reviews VA Form 26-1880 intro screen, then signs-in to reveal an automatic COE link.
- So you've come to this page; what do you do next? I would sign in to start the application. 
- Why on this screen: it says you don’t need to apply for a COE because you have one and you can download now.
- Next: I would go to download COE and click on it. 
- What would you do with it: I would print it out and download and save it to send to the Leander that requested it. 
- Take a look at this screen and describe what you see.
- If you left this page, what do you think would happen to your COE/link? I would go back to the home page. 
- Then what: the download your benefit letters.
- Back to this page: Right. Yes. 

### Task 2 / Missing info scenario / 5 minutes
User goes back to VA Form 26-1880 intro screen, then signs-in with bottom link to advance to the "missing info" intro screen.
- So sign-in again, but this time use the button below all the process information.
- What happened here? What's different? I would go to make a change and click the form. It says you can make changes to the form.
- Next step: I would go to download the COE now. IF I need to make the changes I would download that form. 
- What to make changes on the form: make sure my name is correct. 
- If not correct: fill out the form if I need to make changes.
- Anything on here that will let you make changes: no there is apply and then it says eligibility requirements. I don’t see anything. 

### Task 3 / Complete 26-1880 / 10 minutes
User continues through the form.
I would need to add jr to it.
Next step: click continue then go down and check that my address is correct.
If it were wrong what would you do: I would go ahead and change it where it says street address. Then continue. I would check my number and email and reconfirm my email. Then continue. Then mark what I am. I would pick veteran. Then continue. 
Service history: make sure that it is correct then continue. 
Va loan: I would answer the question. I would click no I have never had a va backed home loan and continue. 
Supporting documents: I would have to load my DD214. If I couldn’t remember I needed to do that I would need to make sure that it is downloaded to my computer. I have it in my file cabinet. I have a paper copy and I think I have one on my desktop computer. I would go ahead and pick dd214 and upload the document. 
Next: go down and click continue
Review: It is giving me another chance to make sure the information is correct so I would click the plus signs and make sure it is all correct. Then I would go down and click I have read and accept the privacy policy.
Would you read it: Yes. I would.
Do you normally: Yes. I would 
Next: I would submit
Confirmation screen: they need to review it but I would print this page because it tells me that I applied. I would click print this page. 
What would happen next: If you go down it tells me I should know within 5 business days, if not I should call or check status.
Where would it take you: back to the screen that it ahs the records on it. 
Letters page: yes. 
Next step: I would just logout at that point. 

## Final thoughts
- If we could store it for you on VA.gov, where would you want that to be?
- How could we make things easier or clearer? Maybe if you need to make changes make sure it tells them they need to have it uploaded. Not everyone has a scanner so they need to look for the form then upload it.
- Tell them upfront: yes. 
- Anything else: No I think it is self-explanatory. 
- Just the dd2214 or records: yes. 
 
## Wrap-up
Looks like we covered everything on my list. (ALT) Looks like we're at (time), so we'll need to leave it here. Is there anything else you'd like us to know--something we didn't cover about the screens we looked at, or VA.gov in general? No. 

##Closing
Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us! Your feedback is critical to our team's effort to improve Veterans' online experiences--and VA.gov in particular. Enjoy the rest of your day!
