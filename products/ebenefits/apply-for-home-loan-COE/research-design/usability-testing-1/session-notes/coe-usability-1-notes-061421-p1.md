## Warm-up
- Please tell us a little bit about yourself. Maybe start with your service experience: My name is Michael Hollis and professor of research and was a broadcaster and got out in 05. Applied for disability a few years ago and got the rating and healthcare last year and now am eligible for va mortgage. I am scheduled for another hearing in a few months for disability stuff. 
- Have you applied for a VA-backed loan before? Not yet but I have the COE, searching for a home now. 
- (If "yes") How did that go, what was your experience? It took 6 tries and denied a few times. I have been going back and fourth by email with the individual at the FL office and uploading documents in the VA system. 

## Wayfinding
User screenshares / 5 minutes
- You heard there was a way on VA.gov to apply for a COE, where would you look for that? Honestly, I would go back to ebenfits just because that’s where I have been finding it lately. Knowing what I am looking for housing benefits, I don’t see that menu here. 
- Next: in my case I would sign in because it has all of my applications. Other wise trying to find something for housing or benefits. The one with benefits would make the most sense. The under housing assistance is how to apply for COE. That is normally general information, I click it thinking it is to get the COE but then I get stuck in a loop. 
- Next step: my case from doing it so much it would take me to ebenefits and take me to get the letter.
- Thoughts on grey box: it is good organization and helpful for people that will be on here. It would be nice to click that ox and get the letter. It would be nice to have more information under there as well. I may qualify under more than one but would stop under veteran. 

## Usability tasks
- So you've come to this page; what do you do next? It is a familiar design for va. There’s one thig I notice is when I go to find the letter it takes me to apply for it, it would be nice to have a separate link to download it. 
- Next step to apply: just start going down logically, required infomration, it says dd214 but I needed a lot more when I applied for mine. That is a logical layout because people will want to sigh in and come back and then the checklist of infomration. That is a logical layout. 
- Next step: just because it is visual just jump straight in. 
- Thoughts: it looks like I have already applied before and it is complete. 

### Task 1 / Automatic COE scenario / 5 minutes
User reviews VA Form 26-1880 intro screen, then signs-in to reveal an automatic COE link.
- Take a look at this screen and describe what you see: it is the same thing, download link there that is nice. My download gives me a technical error. It wont save it because theres a flaw in the document. That is straight word and nice. That would eb god to have because it takes a few minutes pulling up the application then the letter. This is visually nicer. 
- Next: I would want to download it. 
- Only way to save it: print it out as well but I have already emailed it. I know they are able to pull it up on their end as well. 
- Lost and needed again: I would just go right to this link; it would be nice to have them all in one area so I would look in the letters menu first but last week it wasn’t there with he rest of the letters.
- Assume they are all together: yes. 

### Task 2 / Missing info scenario / 5 minutes
User goes back to VA Form 26-1880 intro screen, then signs-in with bottom link to advance to the "missing info" intro screen.
- So sign-in again, but this time use the button below all the process information: since it said make changes, 
- What happened here? What's different? It looks like it is taking me to the initial application again. I don’t see an option to make the change. Yeah, it has the download link which I don’t remember before, I thought this was in the blue box and I don’t remember that being here. Then this information was in the click boxes. 
- Nothing obvious that says you can change: I would assume it is going through the application process again but that is based on the non-stop dealing with eh va. If I were unfamiliar with the process I would be lost at this point.
- What should you do in this case?
- Please continue through the form.

### Task 3 / Complete 26-1880 / 10 minutes
User continues through the form.
- We've put some fake information in this form, but in some place you can make changes.
- You're free to type-in whatever you want--since this is a prototype, it won't submit or change anything in the system.
- Other questions as situation dictates...
- Thoughts: being part of va and a government site: I don’t think they will just let me change the name. 
- Next step: verify everything then continue. 
- Which would you choose: I haven’t gotten rid of it then I need the restoration of entitlement. I would say restoration but I haven’t gotten to that point in the process so I am not certain.  
- Anything to make it clearer: perhaps links to explain each of them. I know what they are but that’s not my scenario so I needed to think of it. 
- Va loan number passed by, do you know what it is and where to locate it: I would assume it is on the mortgage document but I know the COE has a section for prior loans.  I would hope it were on the COE, if I were filling it out for the first time after 30 years I might not have that. 
- Gone through the process before: One thing I discovered was that I had to prove I was on active duty from national guard a few times. I wish it were as easy as uploading dd214 which for active duty it is but for us it is our reserve orders. 
- Next step: mine was under other for the sake of the test. Then upload from the computer. 
- Next document: honestly, I would expect to get an error code due to past experience. If you have a prior loan then it will be that documentation as well.
- Clue on this page: up here. It would be good if it would be personalized based on the applicate. This would be great for former active duty but not for national guard. Either bold or have a color block to have it stand out.
- Second doc: I guess the conclusion there will be documentation that it ahs been paid in full
- Drop down options: va home loan documents
- Next: upload again and then continue. 
- Reason you have to change was to add jr. is it right: Yeah but I would go through it. It looks like it
- Next step: I would go through it to make sure nothing was changed by accident. 
- Assume everything is correct: no one actually reads the privacy act but click it. then submit. 
- What’s here: looks like it went through without errors.
- Next steps for you: Ideally an email confirmation the timeline then it will show up under my va applications pending.
- Where do you check it: I have it bookmarked. I think if I go to the va main it pulls it up for me. 
- Anything on this page for status: normally the myVA takes me back or something under my name. 
- Next steps to be: I guess at this point I am finalizing the mortgage so letting them know it will be done in about a week. 
- Va to get ahold of you: sadly a very slow letter. That’s how I normally know something ahs been changed. 
- Preference: just email. I wish there were a better way to email back and forth. Like at the mortgage office. I just ordered a copy of my C&P exam so like a month later I will get a confirmation it was sent but never get a reply.

### Final thoughts
- Once your COE is issued, how would you like to receive it?
- If we could store it for you on VA.gov, where would you want that to be?
- How could we make things easier or clearer? No I think it is straightforward besides where I said we needed more explanation. 
- If this were the actual VA.gov site, what would you do next? It would be good to have it all in one place. I like benefits because all of the options are in front of me whereas va.gov has all sorts  of applications. Normally I have to scroll forever to get the ones I need and its not always clear. Maybe just organize it categorically. 
 
### Wrap-up
Looks like we covered everything on my list. (ALT) Looks like we're at (time), so we'll need to leave it here. Is there anything else you'd like us to know--something we didn't cover about the screens we looked at, or VA.gov in general?

### Closing
Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us! Your feedback is critical to our team's effort to improve Veterans' online experiences--and VA.gov in particular. Enjoy the rest of your day!
