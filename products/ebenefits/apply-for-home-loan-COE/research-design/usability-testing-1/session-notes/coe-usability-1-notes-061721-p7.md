## Warm-up
- Please tell us a little bit about yourself. Maybe start with your service experience: I am 71 years old, retired US navy. I am on my HealtheVet site serval times a month and I have a premium account. 
- Have you applied for a VA-backed loan before? I have a long, long time ago. Back in the 70’s I believe. (reading page)

## Wayfinding
User screenshares / 5 minutes
- You heard there was a way on VA.gov to apply for a COE, where would you look for that?

## Usability tasks
User is directed to the prototype.
- I have a link in chat to the prototype we're testing; please click on it. (Clicks on prototype link to COE prototype)
- We'll be using made-up scenarios that may not really apply to you. We'll be filling-out a small form, and you can type-in anything--fake names and numbers are fine.
- Nothing will be submitted because this is a prototype.
- For the purpose of this test, we'll continue with what we said earlier: you're looking to buy a new home and your lender said you needed a Certificate of Eligibility.
- So you've come to this page; what do you do next?

### Task 1 / Automatic COE scenario / 5 minutes
User reviews VA Form 26-1880 intro screen, then signs-in to reveal an automatic COE link.
- Take a look at this screen and describe what you see: I would login and then it provides the information needed. If you have all of the things checked off I would go to download. I would click on that link to make sure the information is updated. 

### Task 2 / Missing info scenario / 5 minutes
User goes back to VA Form 26-1880 intro screen, then signs-in with bottom link to advance to the "missing info" intro screen.
- So sign-in again, but this time use the button below all the process information.
- Next step: to make a change I would click the link
- What happened here? What's different? It tells me they have all of the information they need. I would apply for the COE at this point. Being it has all of my information; the next logical step would be to apply for it. 

### Task 3 / Complete 26-1880 / 10 minutes
User continues through the form.
- We've put some fake information in this form, but in some place you can make changes.
- You're free to type-in whatever you want--since this is a prototype, it won't submit or change anything in the system.
- Other questions as situation dictates... 
- What is happening and next step: it is providing step 1 of 6 which is the application process so click continue. Click continue again. Step two, I guess hit continue again. 
- Why wont it let you go further: it looks like I need to confirm my email then click continue. Step 3 of 6, service history. I would click I am a vet. Continue. I guess I would continue. 
- Come to va backed loan: I did so yes then click continue. 
- What do you see here: (reading page): If I were applying for a new on I would click a restoration of entitlement.
- Having read that, why is it the right choice: I a not looking for cash out finance or interest rate reduction I am just applying right now. 
- Your va history: tell us about the va backed loans and asked the month/year, date paid off.  Property address. 
- Next step: Hopefully, I would remember, in put the month/year and I paid off the loan I did. Then the property address. I click no for owning the property. Refinance loan, no. its already done and paid off. Click continue. 
- Supporting documents: I could upload my DD214. I would click on upload a document. 
- If it didn’t work, next step: if it didn’t work I would need to go backwards I guess.
- Anything that indicates type of documents: a copy of the DD214. 
- Go to upload and click it: Right, and I have a copy on my laptop so I would find it and load it. 
- Next step: I wouldn’t have anything else to upload so continue at this point.
- Noticed COE is wrong because you are a Jr. what would you confirm: Check the box I read and accept the privacy terms. Then click submit. 
- Would you actually read it: probably I would click on it to scan through to see what it is talking about. 
- Next step: submit.
- This screen, what happened: It says when I will hear back is 5 business days but I would print this page. 
- Expect to happen after it ahs been submitted: To see if it was accepted. The normal question is when would I hear back but they say within 5 business days. If I have more questions which I don’t it says it has been successfully submitted
- How will they contact you: Through the secure website myhealthevet I hope. 
- Anything else you would do: no I would wait to hear back. 
- Next step: I don’t have any questions; it was successfully submitted so I would be done and wait to hear from them.
- If you didn’t hear form them within 5 days, next step: I would go back on va.gov website and try to search why I haven’t heard anything. 

## Final thoughts
- Once your COE is issued, how would you like to receive it?
- If we could store it for you on VA.gov, where would you want that to be?
- How could we make things easier or clearer? I know on my screen the print is really tiny so maybe the print can be bigger. Yeah like that because I can see. Were all done really, I would be waiting to hear. On the va.gov theres the va benefits and healthcare, I would contact them if I haven’t heard. 
Process: it was easy to go through, just point and click. Its not rocket science. 
 
## Wrap-up
Looks like we covered everything on my list. (ALT) Looks like we're at (time), so we'll need to leave it here. Is there anything else you'd like us to know--something we didn't cover about the screens we looked at, or VA.gov in general? I am familiar with both sites and I can get around easily on both sites. 

## Closing
Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us! Your feedback is critical to our team's effort to improve Veterans' online experiences--and VA.gov in particular. Enjoy the rest of your day!
