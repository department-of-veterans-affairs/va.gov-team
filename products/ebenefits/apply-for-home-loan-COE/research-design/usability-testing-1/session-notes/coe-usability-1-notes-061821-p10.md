## Warm-up
- Please tell us a little bit about yourself. Maybe start with your service experience: I spent 5 years in the army as a combat medic. The va has been amazing for the most part, great programs and provided quality of life back. Having the benefit of going to school is more than most have and I am appreciative of it. 
- Have you applied for a VA-backed loan before? No I have not but I plan on it in the future. 

## Wayfinding
User screenshares / 5 minutes
- You heard there was a way on VA.gov to apply for a COE, where would you look for that? I would sign in and use the login I actually remember. It is clear and concise but it is irritating to have one for each website. I have heard they are doing away with benefits. I like the verification code in case someone shady is trying to get into my account to steal my identity. 
- Now where: Download your benefits letters.  Let me see, I think I would go to benefit letters. That’s my address, 
- Thoughts: I am thinking a letter would be a COE so I am going on that. 
- Expect you have one waiting for you: I would expect it to be waiting somewhere for me. Maybe it is civil service, no. sorry my husband popped in and I was like what. Yeah, no I am totally lost. 
- In terms of getting a COE, automatically qualify: I would believe so, knowing my personal history yes. I would then use the search bar because I get lost. 
- What for the GI bill: Maybe I need to be more specific. Searches COE  va home loan. My ADHD went shiny. Yeah its not working for me today apparently. Clicks eligibly requirements for VA home loan. 
- Why the green button, thoughts: the big header that says how to apply for my COE. My instinct was oh how to apply for my COE.
- Thoughts: I tried to refine the search to save time but apparently it doesn’t save time. I thought maybe a secondary command it would be more specific but then it brought me here to where it use to take you. 

## Usability tasks
- So you've come to this page; what do you do next? I would sign in because they need my personal information. I would go to sign in to start my application. 

### Task 1 / Automatic COE scenario / 5 minutes
User reviews VA Form 26-1880 intro screen, then signs-in to reveal an automatic COE link.
- Take a look at this screen and describe what you see.
- If you wanted to apply for a COE, what would you do first? Clicks on sign in to start the application. 
- (Participant signs-in) What just happened? It basically said I have everything I need and don’t need to apply then click right there its my COE. it makes it very easy. 
- What is your next step? To print it. 
- What is happening: If I need to make changes I could, say for some reason something’s not right I can fill out the form to make the changes and submit it then wait for a reply. 
- If you left this page, what do you think would happen to your COE/link? I would navigate through va.gov, home housing assistance then following the link right here I go oh VA backed home loans then COE and print. 
- Retrace the steps: yes
- Where would you put it: following these links I think it is idiot proof because it says housing assistance which is how I would apply for the COE because it is housing assistance.

### Task 2 / Missing info scenario / 5 minutes
User goes back to VA Form 26-1880 intro screen, then signs-in with bottom link to advance to the "missing info" intro screen.
- So sign-in again, but this time use the button below all the process information: I would retrace the steps and make the changes right here and follow the steps provided. 
- Looking at the steps provide an outline: (reading page) I would click apply for COE then I would of course change all of this and change the suffix because that was the concern. 
- What happened here? What's different?
- What should you do in this case?
- Please continue through the form.

### Task 3 / Complete 26-1880 / 10 minutes
- Looking at the steps provide an outline: (reading page) I would click apply for COE then I would of course change all of this and change the suffix because that was the concern. I would follow it all the way through to make sure it is correct. Reconfirm my email because I am sure it wouldn’t let me through without. I am a veteran
- service history, what do you see: of course I would click the corresponding answer that relates to my personal situation. I would verify the service information and make sure it is correct.
- If it were wrong, what would you do: I would go up here and rectify the situation.  
- Va loan history: then I would click the corresponding situation to me. I would click restoration of entitlement. 
- What do you think about the options, is it clear: Yeah they are pretty clear and concise. Even knowing I had a loan then making a new one. It makes it obvious that I need another one because I already paid off my other one. 
- Va loan history: I would fill out the corresponding information. I don’t want to refinance because I am buying another one. 
- Supporting documents: I would up0load what I needed to regarding the situation like va home loan documents.
- Review application: I would review it and make sure it is correct before hit sending because we are human
- How would you make a change: I guess I would need to go back. I would make the corrections, theres the Jr. click read and accept then click submit the application
- Confirmation page, what’s happening here: I would print this for proof of submission. Then it says within 5 business days I can check back about the application to see if my situation has been corrected and if I don’t hear from them I can call them here.
- What would va do next: I would give it 5 business days then I would check my COE to see if it reflected the jr. if it has been fixed I would print it and if it hasn’t I would call the va to see the status
- Checking status, where: I would go right here.
- Looking at this page: that I applied on this date and it is being reviewed and I will be notified by mail on how to get my COE.

## Final thoughts
- How could we make things easier or clearer? I think it is pretty smooth. 
- Nothing we can do to make it better: I think it is pretty fail safe, it was easy. Its only 6 steps, the hardest part was finding it but that’s the transition because it hasn’t been done yet. 
 
## Wrap-up
Looks like we covered everything on my list. (ALT) Looks like we're at (time), so we'll need to leave it here. Is there anything else you'd like us to know--something we didn't cover about the screens we looked at, or VA.gov in general? No sir not that I can think of. 

## Closing
Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us! Your feedback is critical to our team's effort to improve Veterans' online experiences--and VA.gov in particular. Enjoy the rest of your day!
