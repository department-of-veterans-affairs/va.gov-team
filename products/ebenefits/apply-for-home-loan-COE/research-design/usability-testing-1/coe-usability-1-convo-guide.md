## Intro
Good morning/afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I'm Jim, and with me are a few colleagues who are helping-out by observing and taking notes. We're part of a team with the Department of Veterans Affairs that is moving some features of the old eBenefits site over to VA.gov. We're learning what veterans need to improve their online experience, and how we can make VA.gov more useful for you. Our focus today is the Certificate of Eligibility for VA-backed home loans.

There are a few things I need to mention before we start:
- The session should take about 30 minutes. But you can end it at any time--just let me know. We have quite a few things to cover, so I may break-in occasionally and move us to the next item.
- We're not testing **you** in any way--so there are no right or wrong answers. We need to hear your thoughts and ideas about what we show you so that we can make improvements to the tool we're working on.
- So please say what's on your mind--good and bad. I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- Today we'll be working with a prototype. It's not the "real thing," but most things we're testing will work. We'll have you walk through the tool and enter information, but because we're using prototypes, none of your actions will affect your account or any VA data.
- We'd like to record this session. This'll give us a reference for note-taking. We'll store the recording on a private drive, and we'll delete it when we conclude our testing and note-taking. No personal identifying information will be transcribed.
- I'll ask "on the record" once the recording starts.
- (Start recording) OK now, do I have your permission to record this session?

## Warm-up
- Please tell us a little bit about yourself? Maybe start with your service experience...
- Have you applied for a VA-backed loan before?
- (If "yes") How did that go, what was your experience?
- (if "no") What do you know about VA home loan benefits?
- What do you know about a VA home loan Certificate of Eligibility?

OK, we'll be doing a couple of things today: 
- First, well take a quick look at the VA.gov home page to get an idea of where you might look for the new feature
- Then we'll go to the prototype of the new feature we're testing

## Wayfinding
### User screenshares / 5 minutes
- **Please go to VA.gov.**
- **Now we're ready to start.** OK, now could you share your screen with us?
- Here's a scenario: you're looking to buy a new home and a lender said you could get a Certificate of Eligibility (COE) from VA.
- You heard there was a way on VA.gov to apply for a COE, where would you look for that?
- This is the actual home page; you're free to click on anything.

#### Things to look for:
- What is the user's thought process?
- What interactive elements does the user look for (e.g. menu, links, footer...)?
- What content/section does the user expect to find COE information and the form itself?
- Where does the user's search end? Do they make it to the COE landing page?

## Usability tasks
User is directed to the prototype.
- I have a link in chat to the prototype we're testing; **please click on it.** (Clicks on prototype link to COE prototype)
- We'll be using made-up scenarios that may not really apply to you, and we're using test data in the prototype. 
- Nothing will be submitted because this is a prototype.
- So we'll continue with what we said earlier: you're looking to buy a new home and your lender said you could get a Certificate of Eligibility on VA.gov.
- So you've come to this page; what do you do next?

### Task 1 / Automatic COE scenario / 5 minutes
User reviews VA Form 26-1880 intro screen, then signs-in to reveal an automatic COE page.
- Take a look at this screen and describe what you see.
- If you wanted to apply for a COE, what would you do first?
- (Participant signs-in) What just happened?
- What is your next step?
- If you left this page, what do you think would happen to your COE/link?

#### Things to look for:
- How quickly does the user determine they need to sign-in to access the form?
- How do users react to the automatic COE notification?
- Do user know they were redirected to a different page?
- What do users expect will happen to the COE/link?
- Will the user look at their COE? How would they "save" it?

### Task 2 / Make changes scenario / 5 minutes
User returns to VA Form 26-1880 to make changes.
So let's say you know that you need to make a change--you need to add "Jr." to your name so your records don't get confused.
- What do you do now?
- What happened here? 
- What is this page? What's different from before?
- What should you do to make a change? 

#### Things to look for:
- Do users immediately see they're back on the intro screen?
- How do participants feel about this path vs. the automatic COE scenario?
- Do users expect any further guidance on next steps? How easily/quickly do they find how to proceed to the form?

### Task 3 / Complete 26-1880 / 10 minutes
User continues through the form.
As you go through the form, we'll be using test data. For the purpose of this test you have one VA loan that you paid off.
- You can make changes to any of the test data.
- You're free to type-in whatever you want--since this is a prototype, it won't submit or change anything in the system.
- Other questions as situation dictates...

#### Things to look for:
- Where in the form flow do users stop or get confused?
- What language do participant find confusing?
- What additional info would help users and where?
- What information do participants expect on the confirmation screen?
- Do participants know what they should do next?
- Are users satisfied with the various avenues for following-up?

## Final thoughts
- Once your COE is issued, how would you like to receive it?
- If you came back to VA.gov, where would you want that to be?
- How could we make things easier or more clear?
- If this was the actual VA.gov site, what would you do next?

## Wrap-up
Looks like we covered everything on my list. (ALT) Looks like we're at (time), so we'll need to leave it here. Is there anything else you'd like us to know--something we didn't cover about the screens we looked at, or VA.gov in general?

## Closing
Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us! Your feedback is critical to our team's effort to improve Veterans' online experiences--and VA.gov in particular. Enjoy the rest of your day!
