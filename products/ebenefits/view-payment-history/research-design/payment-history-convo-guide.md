## Intro
Good morning/afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I have a few colleagues on the line who're helping-out by observing and taking notes. We're part of a team with the Department of Veterans Affairs that's moving some features off the old eBenefits site and over to VA.gov. We're learning what Veterans need to improve their online experience, and how we can make VA.gov more useful. Today, we're looking at the View Payment History feature.

There are a few things I need to mention before we start:
- The session should take about 20 minutes, but you can end it at any point--just let me know. 
- We have quite a few things to cover, so to respect your time, I may occasionally break-in to move us to the next item on the list.
- We're not testing **you** in any way--so there really are no right or wrong answers. We'd like to hear exactly what you think about what we show you so we can make improvements to VA.gov.
- Please say what's on your mind--good and bad. I will not be offended by any opinions you express.
- Today we'll be working with an early version of a feature we're developing. Most things we're testing will work, but some might not. But because it's not a live web page, none of your actions will affect your account or any VA information.
- We'd like to record this session. This'll give us a record to use for note-taking. We'll store the recording on a private drive, and it will be deleted when we conclude our testing and note-taking. No personal identifying information will be transcribed.
- I'll ask "on the record" once the recording starts.
- OK, now that I'm recording, do I have your permission to record this session?

## Warm-up
- Would you tell us a little bit about yourself? Your service experience, where you live, general experiences with the VA...
- Have you used eBenefits to check the status of Comp & Pen or Education benefits?
- (If user has disability rating) Would you mind telling us what your disability rating is?
- How often do you visit the eBenefits site? How about VA.gov?
- **Now we're ready to start.** OK, now could you share your screen with us?

## Wayfinding
### User screenshares / 3 minutes
- Before we go to the prototype we're testing, we'll take a quick look at VA.gov
- **Please go to VA.gov.**
- If you were told VA.gov was the place to review your payment history, where would you look on the site?
- This is the actual home page; you're free to click on anything.

#### Things to look for:
- What is the user's thought process?
- What interactive elements does the user look for (e.g. menu, links, footer...)?
- What content/section does the user expect to have career and education benefits?

## Usability tasks
User goes to staging link
- For the purpose of this test, we'll have you use a test account. **Please sign-in using the username and password in the chat.**
- Now I have a link in chat to the page we're testing; **please click on it.** (Clicks on staging link to the VPH screen)

### Task 1 / Identify the bank and account for C&P payments  / 1 minute
- If you wanted to be sure your payments were going to the correct account, where would you check?
- Can you tell me the bank and account number that C&P payments are going to?

#### Things to look for:
- Can useers quickly find the Bank and Account Number columns
- Do they understand the relationship of these columns?

### Task 2 / Find the earliest entry / 2 minutes
- If you were looking for the first payment made to you, how would you find that?
- What is the date of the earliest payment made?

#### Things to look for:
- Do users identify the sort function?
- Do participants use the pagination function to move to the end of the table?

### Task 3 / Determine the highest EDU payment / 2 minutes
- This table shows different types payments, can you tell which kinds?
- Can you find the highest Educational payment made since payment began?

#### Things to look for:
- How quickly do users identifiy the payment type column?
- Do user move through the table to find all payment types?

### Task 3A / Move to the last "page" of the table / 5 minutes
- This table has information arranged in pages; can you find the first entry on the last page?

#### Things to look for:
- Can users easily find the pagination controls?
- Are the pagination controls understandable?
- Do users know what "page" of the table they're on?

### Task 4 / Determine if there are returned payments / 1 minutes
- Looking at this screen, can you tell if there are any returned payments?

#### Things to look for:
- Where do users expect to find Returned Payments?
- Do any users look to the Payments table
- Do users readily scroll down?

### Task 5 / Identify path to report a missing payment / 3 minutes
- If you discovered you were missisng a payment, what should you do?

#### Things to look for:
- Where do users go first?
- Is there "Right-Rail Blindness"?
- Which of the instances of the 800 number seems most "available" to the user?

## Final thoughts
- If this were an actual application, what would expect to happen next?
- What are your thoughts about the questions at the start of the form?
- What on the site would you do/look at next?
- Do you see differences between Chapter 36 and Chapter 31? 
- How could we make things more clear?

## Wrap-up
Looks like we covered everything on my list. (ALT) Looks like we're at (time), so we'll need to leave it here. Is there anything else you'd like us to know--something we didn't cover about the screens we looked at, or VA.gov in general?

## Closing
Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us! Your feedback is critical to our team's effort to improve Veterans' online experiences--and VA.gov in particular. Enjoy the rest of your day!
