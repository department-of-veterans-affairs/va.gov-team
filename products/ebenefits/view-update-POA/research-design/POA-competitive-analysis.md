## Problem
#### eBenefits Representative for VA Claims or Power of Attorney feature

Claims Representative or Power of Attorney (POA) feature enables Veterans to submit Form 21-22 and 21-22a online. These forms allow the Veteran to allocate legal representation regarding a disputed VA claim to a Veteran Service Organization (VSO) (21-22) or legal counsel (22-22a). The application also provides the Veteran with a list of officially recognized organizations and lawyers that can represent the Veteran. 

#### VSO and Attorneys POA forms
**VSO** | Most VSO websites provide informational articles and FAQ pages about the VA's Power of Attorney process.  Within these webpages, the VSO provides links to VA.gov or eBenefits, directing users to the 21-22 or 21-22a forms. There are several other forms and links directing the user to more information provided by VA.

**Attorneys** | There are several examples of law firms that provide their own Power of Attorney forms as PDFs. Standard inputs to the form are the applicant's legal name, today's date, applicant's address, and usually a signed statement agreeing to allow the attorney the right to represent the applicant.  

Previous research was conducted regarding the VA’s Power of Attorney process. 5 lawyers were interview and questioned about how the Power Of Attorney forms were submitted to the VA. Below are quotes from the lawyers.  
Addition discovery about POA process at Law Offices
-	> "We'd be happy to be able to directly upload anything to the VA"
	
-	Beyond the burden this places on attorneys, according to The Office of Business Process Integration, processing faxes and paper documents **costs VA an additional $0.02 per document** as compared to digitally-submitted documents.
	
-	Additionally, we learned that when attorneys submit documents, they do so in tightly-prepared, clearly-labeled packets, which are often pulled apart and mislabeled as they’re processed by Central Mail. 
	
-	> "We feel like our job is to make it as easy as possible for the adjudicators to review a case"


-	> Attorneys stated that they often submit comprehensive, properly labeled evidence for the adjudicators that then gets pulled apart and individually mis-labeled as "third party correspondence,” which further increases the time needed to process a claim.
