## Research Goals 

The team has previously interviewed veterans about how they find and appiont reps to help them complete their claims, so the primary goal of this research was to understand how that process works from the perspective of Veterans Service Organizations and individual Veterans Service Officers. Specifically, we were interested in:
How dow an organization or individual become a VSO?
How does a Veteran or Service Member find a VSO?
Do veterans search for individual representatives or organizations? If organizations, how do they get connected to an individual?
At what point in the claims process do Veterans begin looking for a representative?
What are the limits of what a VSO can help with?
Do VSOs specialize in particular types of benefits or disabilities?

## Research Methodology 

Conversational discovery interviews were conducted remotely using Zoomâ€™s audio capabilities. There was no screen-sharing component. Participants were recruited through internal VA contacts.

### Who we talked to

We spoke to five (5) Veterans Service Officers that represented five different Veterans Service Organizations. 
- 8-25 years of experience as VSOs
- all were also veterans
- 2 upper management/director level
- 3 currently representing clients

### Research Questions

## Key Findings

1. VSOs are largely found through word of mouth and outreach efforts.
2. VSOs want to position claims for the best chance of success and want to talk to Veterans/Service Members prior to a VA 21-22 being filed. 
3. VSOs still rely on in person communication and paper forms, however, COVID-19 proceedures forced a move to more electronic subissions.
4. VSOs use a mix of VA tools and tools internal to their organization.
5. Representatives reported probelms with out of date information and submissions in eBenefits that were not reflected in SEP.
6. Ending represenation is not as clear as beginning representation.
7. VSOs really care about Veterans and work to stay up to date on details that will affect claims.


## Details of Findings
1. Every representative interviewed identified word of mouth and outreach efforts as the primary way they connect with Veterans and Service Members. Many organizations rely on regional outposts with monthly meetings and/or relationships  with medical providers to funnel Veterans to their organization. Three of the representatives mentioned outreach during TAPS but have found that the claims process is not the highest priority during initial transition from active duty. Only two of the representatives mentioned searches on VA.gov and none mentioned OGC. 
> Usually, it's word of mouth. We have a fraternal side and our DAVs have chapters. If you choose to join as a member, which is not required for representation, then you would be placed in a DAV chapter in your local state or community. They meet in random places once a month and then those chapters fall under the state level. A lot of the referrals will go through DAV chapters, which can have Chapter Service Officers (CSOs). States can have Department Service Officers (DSOs). Those filter up to National Service Officers (NSO). We also have TSOs, Transitional Service Officers, which work on local military installations to work with military leaving active service. 
> The biggest way is our reputation. When I mentioned ALS and that we represent 75% of Veterans with ALS, that's a huge percentage and in effect anyone who's diagnosed with ALS gets referred to us... That starts in the private sector. There were changes to legislation in 2008 that we knew were coming in 2007. So we started a massive outreach campaign across the country with hospitals and ALS clinics to let them know what we do and what we can do for Veterans with ALS.

2. Representatives estimated that 80-90% of clients begin looking for a representative before starting the claim process. Although this means they are starting with less initial information, every representative preferred to meet with Veterans or Service Members prior to claims being started so they can position their claim for the best chance of success. Typically Veterans will be routed to individual representatives through a group that determines which department (by specialty, location, or other demographic) is best matched with them. Some of the representatives had slang terms Veterans and Service Members that change representation mid-claim, referring to them as "POA hoppers" or "POA hunters", and the behavior makes them wary. Sometimes these claims are not really related to VA benefits, or the veteran feels they should be getting more than they are. All representatives were very clear that they can consult with any Veteran or Service member, but they cannot take any action until the VA 21-22 is in place and active.
> Usually they haven't even started the process. You get a handful here and there that have already started the claims process, but 9 out of 10 times they haven't. That gives us the opportunity to build that claim out, get it ready from start to finish and give it the best probability of getting maximum benefits for the veteran.
>  We will look at any claim for any condition, as long as you have "credible evidence", that medical nexus where you can tie it to service. We do get repeat customers, because sometimes conditions get worse. But, if they go in and blindly file an increase claim, they are taking a chance that they could lose benefits if they don't have the evidence they need. It's very important that they have that evidence so they don't open themselves up to an appeal to reduce.
>  We call them "POA hoppers". They'll go from POA to POA to POA until they find someone they like.
>  Sometimes you'll have a veteran come to you that is already in the claims process with another representative. For whatever reason they don't like those people, maybe they had words with a service officer or you name it, and they want to come and switch to you. They are allowed to do that, but our business rules prohibit us from taking on that kind of claim.
>  We call them the "POA hunters". Those are the ones that stick out and they usually make their way back around to you. At that point we just won't even mess with it and we decline to take on the case again. 
 

3. All representatives remarked that paper forms and in-person help is still necessary to reach veterans, but that COVID-19 protocols had driven more of their process "online". This largely meant that they were collecting filled-in VA 21-22 forms through encrypted mail and uploading to VA through Direct Mail Upload or the Centralized Mail Portal. Using Direct Mail Upload has decreased the time it takes for a POA to be active from 10 days using fax submission to 3 days.
> Because of the serious nature of the disabilities in our clients, we try to fill out everything we can and send it to them for their signature so they don't have to fill out a whole bunch of forms... Prior to COVID, most of them were paper copies through the mail. Because of COVID, it's changed significantly in that almost everything is done electronically, which actually should be the preferred message because it's made things much easier for our clients and much faster.

4. Tools mentioned include eBenefits (Veteran tool only), SEP, Direct Mail Upload, Centrailized Mail Portal (also referred to as Cenmail Portal), VetsPro, VBMS, CAG, encrypted email, paper forms, and fax. Additionally, each organization has internal tools to manage cases. One representative mentioned creating a special "user guide" to walk Veterans through appointing a representative in eBenefits. This user guide includes screen shots of eBenefit pages, arrows pointing to menu items, and specific information to enter to find the organization.
> Once they file their 21-22, we take that and put it in our CMS (Case Management System), it's an in-house tool. We fill it out and submit the Power of Attorney and an intent to file to the VA. If they come into the office, we just have them fill it out here. We can handle it by email attachment. All of our NSO Offices are co-located with VA Offices and are behind the firewall with remote user access (Citrix). The other way is SEP. We get notified that there is an individual that wants to elect us as POA and we can accept that and reach out to them.

5. Two of the representatives said their organization prefers to get VA 21-22 forms through eBenefits and SEP. After the initial consultation with a Veteran or Service Member, they will ask the client to go through eBenefits to appoint the representative. Then the representative will use SEP to finish their portion of the form and submit to VA. However, sometimes this goes wrong and the appointment does not show up in SEP. When this happens, the Veteran will have to call the helpdesk. Often they revert back to paper forms instead of waiting for digital resolution. This is especially problematic for users that are trying to change representatives during the claims process.
> We prefer to it done through eBenefits because it's instantaneous access for us. We can go in through SEP (Stakeholder Enterprise Portal) and view it on our end, accept it right then and there and gain access to their efile through VA benefits. The paper form is a little slower, but now we can direct upload it. Sometimes you still have to go that route with older veterans, though.

6. When a claim is complete, the file is no longer "active" with VA, but the representation stays in place unless a Veteran does something to explicitly end that representation. There is not a form or formal process to do this, but the most common response was that veterans can write a letter and mail it to VA. Similarly, if a representative chooses to end a relationship, there is no formal process. As mentioned above, changing representation during a claim, or when appealling a decision, can create problems when the representation change is not coordinated.
> The case file is "inactive" but the representation is in place unless the veteran takes action to end or change it.
   > Every once in awhile you will get someone who does something where you need to revoke the Power of Attorney. We let them know our policy and reserve the right to revoke. We'll do an internal write up and send to a management team. When we get the okay internally, we'll write up a Memorandum to Revoke to send to the VA and then we'll send a copy of that to the Veteran.

7. Each of the representatives interviewed spoke with passion about their job and helping veterans. In addition to helping veterans, they can also help family members. They have continuing education to stay up to date on legislative changes and state benefits. Three of five representatives mentioned having systems that proactively flag clients that may be affected by program changes, or that have not had active communication in a certain amount of time. 

## Additional Insights


## Recommendations
1. Determine best end point for process.
    - Do we have information to allow user to send an email to the VSO?
2. Revise content to direct users to contact VSO directly before making a selection.
3. There are several opportunities for further inquiry, including:
    - What functions are available in SEP and how it fits in to the day-to-day usage for VSOs?
    - What is the system of record for VSO contact information and current POA status?
    - How might we connect Veteran > Organization > Individual Rep more consistently?
    - How might we help Veterans find and understand an organization or representativeâ€™s specialty (type of disability, location, other demographic)?
