This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.




**The goal of this document is:**
- To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings


- To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data


- To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Initial Findings





**VSOs are largely found through word of mouth and outreach efforts.**

- Every representative mentioned word of mouth or reputation as the first way that V/sm find them. Three mentioned outreach as a big part of their service.

- Only 2 mentioned VA.gov




**VSOs prefer to start representation at the beginning of the claims process and are wary of "POA hoppers".**

- Representatives estimated that 80-90% of representations start at the beginning of a claims process, and they prefer this so they can evaluate and position each claim for the best chance of success.

- Representative have slang terms for V/sm that move switch representation mid-claim - "POA hoppers", "POA hunters"



**VSOs use a mix of VA tools and tools internal to their organization**

- Two of the five representatives direct V/sm to eBenefits and then use the SEP to retrieve a submitted representation election. Those that do prefer this method.

- One org has a "how to" guide with screen shots and arrows to help V/sm correctly submit their VA 21/22 in eBenefits.

- Other representatives used internal tools to manage incoming VA 21/22 forms.

- Representatives used Direct Mail Upload and Central Mail Portal to transfer forms to VA.





**VSOs want to talk to Veterans/Service Members prior to a VA 21-22 being filed and will turn down or refer to another type of representative if they don't feel they have a good chance of success.**

- Claims have to be directly related to benefits the VA provides and must have a reasonable chance of success.

- Generally claims that are in an appeals process need to be handled by an attorney. Three (?) of the representatives said they have lists of attorneys that have agreed to work at no cost to the V/sm that they will refer to.

- If a V/sm submits a new representation, it ends the old one, but the new is not official until a VSO accepts and signs. This can create issues in the middle of claims.




**Physical paper forms are used less frequently, but still important**

- Older veterans and those with more severe disabilities rely more heavily on paper forms and in person meetings.

- COVID protocols have had an impact on ability to rely on those tools.

- One participant mentioned that COVID has forced his organization to use electronic submissions more and it is easier.

- DMU takes about 3 days to be effective, vs 10 days with fax submissions.



**Representatives reported problems with out of date information and submissions that didnâ€™t seem to go anywhere.**

- eBenefits sometimes has out of date information.

- Sometimes a submission in eBenefits doesn't show up in SEP.

- Some reported problems with V/sm reaching the help desk if they are overseas.



**Ending representation is not as clear as beginning.**

- There is no formal process for a V/sm to end representation and representation does not end at the end of a claim.

- If a V/sm submits a new VA 21-22a, it will end the previous representation.

- Either the V/sm or the VSO can write a letter to the VA terminating the representation, but there is not a standard form or letter.
