DAV for 20 years
USMC veteran Gulf war era
VSO user; VA benefits (some not health)

Asst. director 

Had questions about benefits in a mobile office
Was recruited by DAV

DAV national service officer

Training
Certificates for VSO at service level
Used to have program
Now does on the job training 16-month works with voc rehab with VA
Classes with OTJ
Then your apprentice National service officer
Don’t stop training
VA’s always changing
Rules and regs change different percentage levels, get orange presumptive level
Medical, dental , education
Word-of mouth
Paternal side DAV chapter, has member system representation is free
Placed in chapter local state or community
Some meet once a month
Chapters are under state level
National service officer have NSOs and referrals
DAV chapter have CSO DSO NSO chapter/department/national
Transition service officers work with outgoing service members; captured/referred/
Most is word-of-mouth
No service members don’t even know what they are looking for
100 mil installation; service never hear about VSOs some hear about some service organizations
Not problem, not a choice, 
Most look at org vs. individual; Veterans don’t know who they’re talking to
NSO may reach out to Vet for processing
Referral, email, SEP, mail election made on VA.gov
Had WWII vets and people right before retirement; people may be at any stage; reaches out
POA hoppers; change until they find someone they like
File 21-22 (POA); have own in-house system input into CMS
Put in intent to file they finalize claim
Some may come into office they fill out paper there
May trade attachment
Remote user access (Citrix)
SEP notifies individual wants VSO then individual reaches
CMS is just a DB not for VA uses DNU into VA system
If accepts SEP
Most hard copy or email attachment
Once DMU gets it goes to VBMS
Don’t use benefits
Wants: do you have a rep, then choices, probably just needs the code where should just go into the POA for the nation
Problem is notifying once receive PON
EBN has not role for VSO; just veterans
Just need notification for submission
VBMS has records if a person is a hopper
May reboot and start if claim is a problem
Interact a lot upfront, a lot at the end, but not much in the middle
Only status checks in the middle; don’t reach out unless there’s a problem
No visibility into problems; new notification system could alert
All veteran are different
Not going to review an individual status unless requested
265 NSO Can’t look at everyone’s file
Has a legislative team if laws change have meeting with VA  at national level get heads-s up on law changes or processing
Specialize in disability claims, but can answer any questions about other benefits, state  benefits too, tailored within states know about all the national benefits
Limited to VA benefits 
Could do SS but they are accredited 
If a tort claim, seeing govt can’t do that have to recommend to private attorney
Health care adaptive housing, that’s what we do
Once POA is set it’s there forever
No automatic ending
Once there is a decision on disability rating; after that is just a stagnant claim sitting forever
No “off” switch
Has been in requirements sessions will help if needed
All VSOs are different, can be tricky building 
Straightforward how to connect veteran make sure not missed so VSO can grab them
