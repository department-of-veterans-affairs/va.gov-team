## Warm-up
- VSO programs manager at office works out of Silve Springs MD; works out of Washington DC
- Been with VBA(?) for over a year; job is to be intermediary to provide info to people in the field
- Started just looking for a job; saw position with VSO claims and appeals
- Really enjoys advocating for Veterans; helping Veterans really matters
- Served eight years in USMC; two tours in Iraq; out of reserves, now retired

## Section one: Becoming a VSO/rep
- Prefers the term "VSO" to "rep" (representative)
- Mandatory training, TRIPS training and HIPAA like other VA employees
- There is a lengthy VSO training regarding claims/appeals processes
- Has training to complete to meet OGC requirements
- Has to re-certify every five years
- Refresher training and keeping up with legislative changes is ongoing
- Updates on legislative changes/conditions can cause claim/changes to weighting; and it changes frequently

## Section two: Appointing a representative
- Veterans usually look for organizations vs. individuals
- Could be referered by friend (individual VSOs)
- Veterans look online; site have search tools; ususally search by ZIP or state; VSO have their own searches; results list individual reps
- Veterans call or email; general email monitored
- Most Veterans have not started the claims or appeals process; but 20% have and need help
- Before someone can represent a Veteran, they have to complete 21-22 to give VSO POA
- 21-22 is sent to VA they note the appointment, and VA grants access to Veteran records
- They inform Veteran upfront they must be given POA to represent the Veteran
- Upload 21-22 to portal online; imports to VA; logs into VA system; access has to be granted by VA
- Used to be a fax
- Some VSOs use their own program or site to upload
- Paper and face-to-face are still popular, so they still mail 21-22
- Some officers have physical location so everything can be handled in-person
- They do not move forward with anything regarding claim until 21-22 is submitted

## Section three: Working with Veterans
- Younger Veterans have more information upfront on CD they get at discharge; so they can get medical info upfront
- Older veterans don’t; Some info was destroyed in a fire
- May start with minimal info; may need info from doctors and family members
- There is frequent contact early on; after it’s when there is an update
- They have access to VBMS to check cases/status
- Often, they help family members vs. Veterans
- Sometimes Veterans come in/call when they receive letter
- Typically, contact is onece a month or so
- Timing is three to six month for initial claims, way faster than it used to be
- No specialty — any kind of claims (health)
- Some orgs are very specialized; (PBA) work with paralyzed Veterans
- Most common things are mental health conditions, physical knee back problems
- Example of update linking respiratory conditions to Service, update allows this
- Sometime call from veterans, so need to be educated on updates when questions come in
- Veterans need to know how weighting table affect them

## Section four: Limits and ending appointment
- Only up to the board of appeals; after refer them to lawyer
- Attorneys working pro bono
- Other limitations issues related to state or local area—if not a VA issue they are referred
- References are usually to no-cost firms
- Provide list—no favoritism
- Usually find out about the issue by talking to the Veteran/initial convo
- Can help most veterans; some circumstances are extraordinary
- Once a veteran appoints someone else, automatically terminates representation
- If Veteran just wants to stop, they can; write letter to VA for processing VA will 

## Wrap-up
- Knows about eBenefits, but no-one monitored system so 21-22 didn’t go any where
- No one monitored it; wasn’t well managed
- VSO just weren’t aware of feature, so make sure VSO knows feature is available and active and use it
- Communication/meeting with VBA inform VSOs about feature
- Make sure correct contact info is correct and up-to-date; many complaints
