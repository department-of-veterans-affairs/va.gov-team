---

- Director of field service for PVA
- Veterans Benefits department
- Filed service is bigest component
- 73 office across US 2 in PR
- 50 offices are in ROs
- 25 are in VAMCs
- If they have spinal cord injury center
- Oversee operation
- Country dividend into three regions
- E s and w
- Different from other VSOs they have too jobs NSO is what they’re called
- Like other VSOs they represent Veterans and widows but their expertise is in Healthcare
- Used to make rounds on regular basis before COVID 
- Even reps have expertise in VA healthcare
- Unique in specific area like spinal cord injury and disease represent 75% of veteran with ALS 
- Experience with catastrophic disabilities
- Special compensation is above 100%
- Continue to refine 
- Been a rep for 25 years
- got into this line of work because needed assistance from VA long winding road led to a VSO and ultimately PVA
- Most people want to get out, get wrapped up and get to their life
- It’s not well know, more now, what VA does and what assistance VA give
- Things have changed in the last 25 years
- By filing a claim and looking for assistance himself
- It’s a passion and a way of life
- Biggest way is reputation
- ALS of veterans with ALS huge percentage of that population
- Veterans with ALS are referred to PVA
- Hospitals refer veteran based on reputation
- 2008 regulations changed for veterans with ALS, started outreach campaign to hospitals, doctors and clinics
- That’s how the referral/reputation started
- After veteran passes away, they represent the widow(er)
- 25 representative at VA hospitals
- Prior to COVID representatives would meet with patients
- When referred there is a specific office to contact, could go to web site search for an NSO with map/office
- Claim might be in-progress, claim might be denied and need appeal or reopen it
- There are a lot of new injuries, didn’t matter where they lived they initiated claim in Boston
- Send them a 21-22 (POA) they sign and return and submit to VA
- Because of the serious nature of injury, they fill out form before time, and other forms, try to collect and complete all forms
- Before COVID, most were paper forms in the mail, now almost everything is electronic—this should be the preferred method
- Make it faster
- They have internal secure email
- 99.9% they use direct upload to VA, before they would fax to central mail and they would upload
- Now they use direct upload
- Haven’y used benefits in so long so they have access to personal account since veterans, passwords change every 90 days
- Some staff uses SEP a lot found more effective/useful tools
- Just VA… certain programs are more effective than others
- Veterans shouldn’t submit a POA on their own, 
- Gives conflicts, not helpful for many reasons
- VSOs have to accept the POA
- An automatic system that just appoints VSO causes problems
- Once a veteran is in appeal, a lot of VSOs won’t accept a veteran until it’s resolved, at some point
- If a veteran wants a VSO, they should speak to the VSO
- Some veterans had problems, with citations, foreclosure, can’t pay rent—seems to be no limit to what someone comes to get help for
- A lot of times problems are relevant to disability claims
- Will work with VA to document financial hardship
- Some thing and individual needs an attorney, can’t take on everything
- National office has other departments that deal with other issues, ex: dealing with accessibility issues, architecture department
- Can’t recall referring someone to an attorney, not VSO either, sometime to other departments or local resources
- Looked for other services local for Veterans, not a lot of outside referrals
- Even though most have spinal cord injury, 30% make up all other disabilities/issues
- May get referrals form attorneys
- Generally if they’re starting from scratch with new patients
- Often a doctor letter is enough to initiate the process
- Need all the other basic docs DD214
- Might have to get a medical opinion, VA or private
- VBA already has access to the VA healthcare records
