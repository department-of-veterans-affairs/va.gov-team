## Research Questions & Answers
### Power of Attorney
**Is the wizard intuitive to the Veterans?**</br>
- Participants expressed confusion about what exactly they were filling out and wanted more context up front regarding the form and what to expect.
- Participants remarked that the steps were “Easy to complete or fairly straight forward.”
- Participants favored the small amount of information and limited interaction per screen.
- Participants remarked some steps were not intuitive; specifically, the VA Number, Limiting Consent, Privacy Act, and the Insurance Number. 
- When encountering error states, some participants wanted more information regarding what the error was about and how to address the error.

 
**Is the information presented clearly?** </br>
- Many participants did not understand they were filling out Form 21-22 and were unsure how to fill out certain steps. 
- Two things hindered participants from completing the steps: when the instructions were in legal language or if there was a lack of information providing the necessary context.
- Participants indicated a preference towards summarizing legal language into layman terms.
 > Users are overwhelmed by all the text on this page. Most users think they will not read most of 
 > this text (even though they find the text important) and skip to the next step. 

 > Quotes:

 > “This is a heck of a lot of reading! Most of us will not read all of that. Anytime you see “terms 
 > of service” that you have seen 50 times before, you want to skip over it.“
 > “90% of veterans are not gonna read it!”
 > “That is a lot of reading!”

**Do users understand how to fill in each field?** </br>
- Participants did express a lack of confidence in how they completed certain steps, specifically, VA number, Insurance Number, Authorization of Address Change, and Limited Consent.
> “Is this the correct information to provide?” and “I don’t know? Should I answer it this way?”. 
- Some participants confidently answered the Confirm Personal Information, Military Service, and Privacy act steps.   
> “Yes, it clearly asks for this...”
- Participants were also hesitant to complete certain fields and expressed their desire to “get more information or talk to someone about this” before completing the field.  
- Overall, participants expressed mistrust for the VA and worried that an incorrectly filled out form would negatively impact the outcome of the appeal. 
- The participants that commented on the steps being clear and easy to complete coincided with having expressed confidence in knowing what and how they were answering.

**What do users think will happen after they’ve submitted the form?** </br>
- Participants were unclear about what would happen once they completed the form.
- Participants often wanted to know whether or not the VA would send the form to their chosen representative.  

**What type of information do Veterans expect to see in the search results?** </br>
- Participants favored representatives with a complete profile over those lacking representative information, such as a missing number or address. 
- Participants with fewer results wished to have non-local representation offered.  
- Several participants also wanted to see the representative’s subspecialties, judgment stats, representative’s name, and representative's phone number.  
	
**What other tools/sites do Veterans use to complete the Power Of Attorney Form?**</br>
- All participants preferred completing the form with their representative present.

- Participants spoke about word-of-mouth and Veteran services as valued resources.

**What matters to a Veteran when choosing a representative?**</br>
- The participant’s history demonstrated an evolution in how representatives are chosen.  Many participants find a representative through word of mouth. In some cases, that representative will not work for them and they then choose a different representative.
