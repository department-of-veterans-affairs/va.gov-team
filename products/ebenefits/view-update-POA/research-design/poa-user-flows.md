#### Users
Users can be any Veteran. VA recommends that Veterans appoint an accredited Veterans Service Officer to help them initiate their claim, gather their required medical records and evidence, and submit their claim. Veterans can appoint a Veteran Service Officer, claims agent, or attorney to act on their behalf. These individuals are trained and certified in VA claims and appeals, and can help guide the Veteran through the process.

Generally, users can find a representative two ways:
- Go to eBenefits to find a local representative (including a recognized VSO, an attorney, or a claims agent) by state/territory, zip code, or the organization’s name.
- Or search the VA Office of the [General Counsel’s list](https://www.va.gov/ogc/apps/accreditation/index.asp) to find VA-recognized organizations and VA-accredited individuals by name, city, state, or zip code.

#### VA Forms 21-22 and 21-22a
The "paper" forms are available online [(21-22 for VSOs)](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-22A-ARE.pdf) [(21-22a for individuals)](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-22-ARE.pdf) as a fillable PDFs. The forms themselves are both two pages long and include four sections:
- Veteran information
- Claimant information (if other than the Veteran)
- Organization information
- Authorization
