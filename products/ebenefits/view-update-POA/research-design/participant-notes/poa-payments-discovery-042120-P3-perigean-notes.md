## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
We are going to be talking about how you use certain VA benefit features today. You will not be asked to divulge any personal health information. Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.
Tell me a little about your background and your service history.
Well. Actually right now I don’t do anything due to COVID19 . I am a disabled veteran so I stay home all the time. 

## Document Expectations - 10 minutes
Are you currently using a PoA or representative to assist with a disputed VA claim? 
Not at the moment but I have used the DAV. 

How did you find out about this service? 
The Veteran service office that originally assisted told me. 

Can you briefly tell us what you know about VA’s Power of Attorney. 
I don’t remember much about it but is provides authority to someone else to act within your place. I have used it in the past but I quit using them in 2015. 

## Discover Pain Points - 10 minutes
How familiar are you with the Power of Attorney form, also called the 21-22 form?
Yes I have filled it out and had one prior to getting out of the military and I had one for my mother. 

**Screens**
## Privacy Act
What are your initial thoughts about this step? 
Well it is important information and I see that. I wouldn’t sit and read the whole thing even though I know I should. 

Why is it important: 
it refers to the privacy act notice and reasonability. 

Why would you not read it:
Just because of my disabilities when I read things sometimes I cannot understand it so I skip over long paragraphs.

What are your feelings about how the VA presents this legal text on its pages? 
I would be more comfortable if there were larger words. I know if I brought it up on my screen it may be kind of small so I would need larger letters. 

## VA Number (796-12-4704)
Thoughts: Well I would say the file number, unless you are an older veteran with service numbers it is redundant because you already put your ssn and I do not think they should use it as an identification. We have IDs that they use like drivers’ license. 

How does it make you feel: 
I have no choice I have to so I am between a rock and a hard place. I have had my identity stolen before. There have been hacks for the VA websites as well. 

## Personal information
Thoughts: This information is okay I guess expect I don’t like my SSN on everything. 

Is there more than the SSN: 
No I guess the rest of the information is needed because it is personal information. 

How often do you update your personal VA information? 
If I move but I don’t move often so there isn’t any reason to. I check it to make sure it hasn’t been changed. I don’t tend to change my email or number. 

How often does the VA have the wrong information? Rarely. 
Last time they changed my address. 

## Search for Representative
Please give me your thoughts about this step? When I first look at it is overwhelming because they have every state listed but it can be narrowed down by state. Still seems like a lot of information at once. 

What seems like a lot of information: when you have to scroll through the states. 
What is the paragraphs below.
What is helpful: 
The boxes with extra information because it will allow you to have someone close by. 

Why is distance important: 
it depending on your mobility. You might need someone to come to you or close by because you don’t drive. 

What besides mobility: 
their ability to help you and history of helping other. Number of complaints, if any. 

Ability to serve you, explain: 
well helping and serving are the same thing but how they keep in contact and updated on the progress of the claim. The lawyer I had in 2015 never contacted me and I had to contact them when I wouldn’t get things to the VA so I fired them. I found the PoA prior to filling out the form because I didn’t want to commit until I had someone helping. 

Do you see this as searching or committing to someone: 
I see this as searching but I didn’t know about this prior to looking for an attorney. 
Did they help you fill this out: Yes, we did it together.

Prefer that method or website: 
By myself

why: 
You don’t want their preference to influence your decision. They will prefer their company over another company . They will omit their ability to close cases or get the benefits you would like. 

Using this to vet an attorney: 
Yes

Other items needed that aren’t current present: 
I cant see it all that well but I think it is complete. 

## Representative Table
Please give me your thoughts on this table? 
This provides the list of attorneys 

Expectations: 
Yes, that is what it looks like to me. It provides all of the information that you will need to contact them to make a choice from there. 

You would call then go from there, would you stop the form now: 
No. I would complete the form. 

Impression what you are doing: 
Choosing a PoA

Needed information that would be helpful: 
Maybe their rating system if it is possible to do an unbiased rating. Rating would be completed files successfully from people that they helps. Like the Better Business Bureau or how successfully they are at doing this. 

## Confirming Representative
Please give me your thoughts on this step? Well it would help if it showed you the one that you select but provides you the option to pick a different one. 

Do you see value in this screen? 
Yes

Other thoughts: 
Not at this time. 

## Insurance Number
Thoughts: 
What do they need my insurance number for and what kind of insurance. It does not specify. 
What would you do: I would have to leave it blank because I don’t know what kind of insurance they are looking for but I assume it is the VA. 

Does the Va provide a number: 
I don’t know.

Do you know your number off hand? 
I would have to go through my papers to see. I have home insurance and car insurance. 

## Military Service
Please give me your thoughts on this step? 
This is another place they want your SSN; 
I don’t understand why they need it multiple times within one application. 
Some veterans have different ones like older veterans. Service number is a SSN in my mind.

Was the questions confusing: 
No but I do not understand why they need to understand which branch you were in. 

How does that question make you feel: 
I think it is a pointless question. 

Any other thoughts: 
No.

## Limited Consent
Thoughts: If it is part of the claim that is being made I don’t understand why they would exclude art of the medical records because it could be important if its part of the claim they might need to know. If you try to block that part of the medical records from the claim they would not have all of the information they need.

How would you fill it out: 
I would fill it out honestly and completely. Its not a secret I smoked pot and it would be part of my claim. 

Element that the claim may not get through if the information is not allowed: 
yes I would feel like the aspects of drug abuse may be needed to the claim so excluding that information form the claim is questionable. 

Do not hurt the claim, still include, or opt out: 
Yes. 

Needed: 
a detailed explanation. 

Would you focus on this information: 
Yes. 

Why: 
Because it has to do with my claim and personal information and what I want them to know.

## Legal Understanding - 10 minutes

## Payment History - 15 minutes
We are going to change gears a bit and look at a different part of eBenefits.
Confirm with the participant that they can see the eBenefits Payment History screen.

### Accessing Payment History
Do you currently receive payments from the VA? 
Yes I do. 

How long have you been getting payments from the VA?
Have you ever seen this page before?
If so

How often are you coming to this page? 
It has been a long time since I have been on ebeenfits because all I have been doing is tracking my appeal. I don’t have anymore to put into the claims so I don’t go there often.

Do you prefer to check your VA payment on your bank's website or the VA? 
With my bank.

How would you know there is an issue?
How would you fix the problem? They have been taking money out of my benefits to cover my prescriptions so I come to this page to see what they did with the money.

How often are you looking for a particular payment? 
I look at everything when I go onto the page. This is one I like to look at because they put pending payments on it to I believe. It is under payments.

In the table: 
yes I see the pending payments it wont show up months before only a few days prior. 

Come here to see the amount: 
Correct

How would you like to see just the one payment: 
Highlighted or in different groupings in a different heading. 

How would you pull that one payment so it could be pulled out and highlighted: 
Under display and view. I could filter it as well. 

How often are you looking for a range of payments?

## Wayfinding tasks 5 minutes
"OK we're going to switch gears and ask you to tell us where you would look for the features we've discussed on VA.gov

### Power of Attorney
For this exercise we are going to ask you to share your screen. 
Let's say you heard that you could fill out the form to appoint a representative (the one we looked at earlier) on VA.gov. You have navigated to VA.gov and now want to find the application. Show us where you would go to find it."

I would still go to disability first.

Why: 
For the PoA to do my claim I would assume it would be under disability. 
It doesn’t have one on there. Does have PoA under any attorney on here? I don’t see anything that says anything about a PoA so I would have to go through everything. 
T
hank you.
