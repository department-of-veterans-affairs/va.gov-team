## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
We are going to be talking about how you use certain VA benefit features today. You will not be asked to divulge any personal health information. Before we look at the website, let us start with a few warm-up questions.
Tell me a little about your background and your service history.
I enlisted and have been working as a chemist in the civilian world so I enlisted for the 82nd and served in combat arms. I got classified as a medicine specials and chemical lab specialist Than after I joined the special forced national guard. I have 24 years of service half of the special forces. I was one of the first on the disaster forces before 9/11. I went to e-6 and sent to PA school for the army. Came out as a CW2. A year later they sent the PA to officers than made it to Major. 

## Document Expectations - 10 minutes
Are you currently using a PoA or representative to assist with a disputed VA claim? 
Actually I tried to do it without assistance with filling my claim. I went to WV VA. They were not extremely helpful and I was working for the VA as an orthopedic PA. Frequently I heard individuals say if the VA keeps messing with me I would get Jane Dills. Jane Dills is a good attorney that handles claims against the government. When I tried to get my disability to an appropriate level I keep getting turned down. I finally contact Jane Dill’s office and everything fell into place so I still get communication from them and talk to them if I have an issue. I ended up going to a different VA to be evaluated by an objective doctor. The nurse PA that did the evaluated did not know what she was doing when examining my knee. I saw my x ray prior to going to the appointment. The other PA had it on their computer and asked what I thought of my x rays. He asked when we would schedule for bi-lateral replacements and laughed because it was my knees. A person with basic knowledge of an x ray would have been able to see it. When I told her about the x-rays, she said you are not getting a total knee.

Is that what caused you to think of a representative: 
absolutely. I complained about and then they sent me to another PA and they did a poor examination as well and only provided a 10 percent. I did a lot of jumps and a thousand miles of carrying a ruck sack of 75-100 pounds. When the weather changes my knees scream and I could not get any assistance. I had to pay out of pocket for the surgery, do an evaluation then they get submitted to the va and it was finally increased. 

## Discover Pain Points - 10 minutes

How familiar are you with the Power of Attorney form, also called the 21-22 form? 
I am sure I filled it out for representation but I did not do it online.

How did you do it: 
in their office.

Was it helpful and why: 
well because I felt like they knew what they were doing, they did it many times before and I had confidence that the individual was knowledgeable and would do the paperwork proper. I did not have that perception when dealing with people in the VA.
The first step we will be reviewing is the Privacy Act.

Screens
## Privacy Act
What are your initial thoughts about this step? 
That there is a lot to read and I have a master so it is not like I only have an 8th grade education. It seems like there are a lot of information that may be hard for some to comprehend. 

Explain what it is saying: 
That I had to go through all of this to indicate who my representative will e. it seems like I am requesting the va to provide a representative which makes me questions whose wealth fare they are looking out for. A request for representative is like the VA is supplying on and then how objective will they be in dealing with my claim. 

Other parts of the screen that provides that impression: 
It is back to the, they are saying you can  have a VSO like the DAV or an attorney but it has to be one that is recognized by the va if that is what I am reading anyway. The rest of it is saying that my SSN will indicate who I am as a VA and filing the claim my SSN will identify me. There are a lot of words that you read and have to re-read to understand it. Even after looking through it when you have the respondent burden mentioning the legal codes, that is a lot of legal terms I do not understand. It is confusing but I understand why it is there. I understand that the VA has to tell me that their benefit decision and things like that fall under the U.S codes. I am not an attorney and I am not poorly educated but it is intimidating and I does not seem like it is needed. 

What would be the first step: 
just supplying the information like the SSN, and other information related to my disabilities. Also when the issues occurred, service experience, it is expected to provide that information. 

### VA Number (796-12-4704)
Thoughts: A lot better, it is simple. They could clarify the VA file number and indicate that it is your SSN, if that is what it is. It just asked the VA file number, if I have not filed than I do not have a file number so it is not clear. This is more comfortable than the prior page. This is straightforward. 

### Personal information
Thoughts: Clear straight forward. I would not mind filling this out, I do not have to research 3-4 hours to find a date or number to fill in.

Is that common searching for a while: 
No normally, no. if they are for certain dates for an experience than I have to research that. It is nice not having to do that for this request.

Information needed to improve: 
Not really. This is when I am requesting a representative. Maybe a place where I can designate who I want to be the representative unless that comes up somewhere else.

What action would you take and why: 
I would fill it in. 

### Search for Representative
Please give me your thoughts about this step. I think it is clear. Again I would pick an attorney because that is what I did. Accordingly I understand that they can charge, that does not need to be explained more but it does not clarify that. Maybe there would be an explanation on what that means that they are not able to charge me and what is in it for them. It does not make sense and does not provide information.

Would the important impact you: 
personally no but when working with the Va. I have met many veterans that got the runaround that they are paranoid and do not trust anything that is no in black and white. That is not the unusual situation it is typical. They say they do not trust them and when you see something that says attorney and agents cannot charge you it is like yeah right. I find it to be a lack of explanation that there should me. 

Why it would not impact you: 
Well, maybe because I am more trusting or less paranoid than other guys. It says they can charge me but I would ask Jane Dill’s office what that is about and I trust them to explain it to me. When preparing it in their office I would ask them. I am signing it saying that I understand you cannot charge me but in reality I do not understand they. Doing it online I do not have anyone. I can note on the side to ask them the next time I call.

Was that discussed: 
I honestly cannot remember. I know they explained that they took the small fee based on the back compensation and if I did not get back compensation they did not receive anything at all. If I go 10,00 they would get a percentage. 

Information conveyed would assist the group of individuals that have fear: 
I think it would yes. Just not a lot of legal term, having the plain text would assist. Having they cannot charge you but can take a percentage of the back pay. It says they are not charging per hour rather a percent of the back pay that wont really affect me. 

How would you fill this out: 
I would like an attorney, then put Jane Dils in Charleston, WV. Then within 10-15 miles and first name. 
What would you do in this step: it says no PoA was found. 

What are you thinking: 
that would throw me.

What about it: I
t would be frustrating to me. Well, I would call Jane Dils office to tell them I got to this point and you are not listed and see what they say to do. 

Say it is a VM and you are still here, what would you do: 
I would wait until I hear from them I know that they do this every day so there is a glitch somewhere if they aren’t listed. I would not go farther I would wait until I heard from her office. 

### Representative Table
Please give me your thoughts on this table. I would select Jan Dils.

### Confirming Representative
Please give me your thoughts on this step. Simple easy to do, that is fine. 
What was accomplished during this step: 
we were able to select who I wanted to designate and it would provide the PoA for them to communicate with the VA on my behalf. 

### Insurance Number
Thoughts:
Can you tell me what you know about the insurance number?
How often are you asked for you insurance #
Do you know your number off hand?

### Military Service
Please give me your thoughts on this step. It is clear and straight forward. The guys in the Vietnam era has serial number but shortly after we started using the SSN instead. If you do not know the branch of service you have a problem. 

### Limited Consent
Can you talk to me about your initial thoughts regarding this step? 
It looks pretty clear. If I had someone representing me I would want the Va to disclose all of my medical records. That is really clear, I see the restrictions but I think that personally you tell your attorney everything than let them sort it out. I would not withhold information. You go back 6 months into the process and say I did not say this  had to go to AA because of what happened in the military they would ask why you did not tell me it 6 months ago it could be service connect. It make sense to let them know ahead of time. I understand that a person is less likely to have their attorney know they are able to mark them on this page. 

If you picked a VSO would that change the decision: 
probably, yes because someone that may be an alcoholic of a result of a service experience. The VSO will say we need to know everything because it could be service connected, other than they are ashamed of drugs or alcohol they know to admit it to allow it be part of the record and compensation. 

### Authorizes an Address Change
Thoughts: After reading through it, it involves people that are unable to handle their resource. It authorizes the PoA to act on the veteran behalf to change the veteran’s information or to refuse the authorization. It is pretty clear.

Difference before reading: 
Yeah, I did not know what it was relating to based on the titles. It did not make sense until you read the paragraph. You can authorize them to give the va your information or not. This is the form that you have to fill out for that.

Initially not clear but after reading it was: 
Yes.

What would you do: 
I would pick why

Why: 
well if you have someone represent you, you have to trust them to do what is right for you. There is no reason why they would not be able to. I would have them to do it so I know that the paperwork is going correcting instead of me talking to someone. I would rather my representative so they had documentation on the change, who they spoke to and what was done. If there was a question months later they could say exactly when they were notified and what happened. 

### Error Messages- 
Just tells me everything was straightforward and my answers made sense and were accepted by the VA.

### Legal Understanding - 10 minutes

## Payment History - 15 minutes
We are going to change gears a bit and look at a different part of eBenefits.
Confirm with the participant that they can see the eBenefits Payment History screen.
I am going to continue sharing my screen with you. Can you see the eBenefits website on your computer? So I am going to click through to the Payment History screen. Just so you are aware there is only one screen to review.

### Accessing Payment History
Do you currently receive payments from the VA? Yes I get compensation. 
How long have you been getting payments from the VA? It has been a few years. In the national guard I could get it for the days I did not drill. I started researching it with the VA provide when I should have been diagnosed with diabetes. I had lab forms and they know I was diabetic but did not diagnose me. 

Have you ever seen this page before? 
No I do not think so. 

How do you check: 
it is directly deposited

Do you go to the bank: 
I just do it online to confirm it is there

Any issues with a payment: 
never

What if there was: 
I would call Jan Dils office. I would let their office find out what happened because trying to contact someone in the VA is frustrating a lot of the times. 

If they told you about this site and you can check here, how would you find a particular payment: 
I can filter it to go back 3 months that would tell me how much I got last month and this month. It does not really example why there is a difference but confirms there was a difference in payment. 

Question about 2 years ago, how you would find it: 
I would look at the filter to see how far back I can go, I would have to go to all. Then go from there. 

Next: 
I would go down to the one for two years ago than work back toward the present. 

Anything done well: 
Only if there were an adjustment, it would be nice to have a column for why it was different. If there were a code or column that says if it is travel pay, back pay, clerical error pay or an indication of a different payment.

Anything else: 
NO. as it is it is telling me that they are mailed checks. If someone took it out of my mailbox and I do not have it deposited in my bank I can say I never got the check. 

Feel about the details page: 
I think it is fine, it is showing all I hope that I would see but if there is a difference in the pay I would like to see hat listed somewhere. 

## Wayfinding tasks 5 minutes
"OK we're going to switch gears and ask you to tell us where you would look for the features we've discussed on VA.gov

### Power of Attorney
For this exercise we are going to ask you to share your screen. I have added the Zoom's screenshare instructions to the chat. The chat icon can be found in the lower part of the Zoom app's window.

Let us say you heard that you could fill out the form to appoint a representative (the one we looked at earlier) on VA.gov. You have navigated to VA.gov and now want to find the application. Show us where you would go to find it."
I would go the va benefits and healthcare, then to I guess disability again than I do not know. I would not be eligibility or anything on the left. I might think managing the benefits or check the claim/appeals status.

Why would it be under manage your benefits: 
it was intuitive to me because I already have benefits so get benefits would not apply. I would start by signing into the account.

Where next: 
I would scroll down, I do not see anything other than disability compensation that includes claim. I do not see where I would find the PoA unless it is listed on the disability compensation

Certain words looking for: 
Representative is the key word. Track claims or view status. I would look there to see. On down it says you can view your representative for va claims. 

What next: 
I would go to that one to look at representatives or va claims. I guess to scroll down to track claims section. I do not see it

What next: 
go back up to re-read it to see if I made a mistake somewhere. According to this I should be able to find the information I need. 

What do you mean: 
the explanation above says I should be able to go down to see claims and appeals and click on it to see my representative.

### Payment History
"Let us say you heard that you could see a list of payments the VA has sent you (the feature we looked at earlier) on VA.gov. You have navigated to VA.gov and now want to find this list. Show us where you would go to find it."

I would say going to VA benefits and healthcare

Why: 
well I know I do not need the location or hear anything about the VA I want to know about the disability payment. 

Next: 
go to disability and click on it. Manage benefits and view payment history.
