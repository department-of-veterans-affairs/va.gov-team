## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
We are going to be talking about how you use certain VA benefit features today. You will not be asked to divulge any personal health information. Before we look at the website, let us start with a few warm-up questions.
Tell me a little about your background and your service history.
Was in the navy for 4 years than the army for 4 years. S contractor and civil service and my sons are in the military and I work for FEMA right now. Working mitigation and disaster. 

## 3Document Expectations - 10 minutes
Are you currently using a PoA or representative to assist with a disputed VA claim? 
I have used the DAV but they did not help so I used the American Legion and the lady I work with is challenging so I pretty much do it on my own. I recommend if someone is doing a claim that they have someone so that they can get into the database. 

Can you share your reasoning behind electing a representative for your claim?
Who did you end up choosing?
Is that an attorney or a VSO?

How did you find out about this service? 
I have had it for a number of years and used them when I got my claim started than went back to renew my claim. Nothing was going on and the representative did not do much so I wen tot the DAV and the person was not able to help so I went back to the American legion. 

What are the steps you think might be involved in selecting a representative for the Power of Attorney process? 
I recommend someone pick someone in DAV , American legion an organization because they have a system and have access to the government system. They are a liaison. And they are challenging and do not want to work so if you want it to get done you must be able to get it done yourself. Here we have older individual that needs help doing the claim and have issues so the programs need to be redone and they need to be held accountable. I am looking at being able to audit individuals because they are not doing it or helping people. The PoA allows them to have access to their records. 

## Discover Pain Points - 10 minutes

Screens
### Privacy Act
What are your initial thoughts about this step? 
My son is really smart and asks if I read it all. I just say yes. I think that it is to much and many people click yes just to move on so it needs to be smaller. 

What is it saying and why: 
it is saying you are giving them access to your information, its like HIPPA. You are allowing someone to represent you and you let them have everything and use it with caution.

What part: 
the entire page but the average person does not read it. All websites have this and its to much information. The older and younger generation will not read it so if you summarize it and highlight the important points people will read it. 

### VA Number (796-12-4704)
Thoughts: It is your SSN. It used to be the draft numbers but now it is the SSN. 

Any other thoughts: 
keep it simple, its good. A lot of people do not have time and you must take their temperament into account. Many are challenged mentally; you have to keep in mind that you are looking at veterans but a lot of folks have mental and emotional challenges. 

What is simple and why is it good: It is clean, limited information, centered information in document and there are tabs. 
You like the tabs, 
why: 
Yes. They are systematic. 

Explain: 
You are going in the system in which you need to get the information. That is really how many people think. 
Registers to many: Right, or you could do the click, push buttons. Either way. Like when you click on the tab to fill out the information. I think the tabs are a lot better. 

Why are tabs better: 
Like I said it is like doing laundry. You do it in a system. 

### Personal information
Thoughts: I think that would be fine. 
Explain: 
I would highlight the titles in bold. 

Would that help: 
They are the same font right now and you want to make sure that the person sees the name. like writing a paper you always bold the title. 

Anything else: 
No that is fine. 

## Search for Representative
Please give me your thoughts about this step. I think this is good, I would but the VSO, and veteran organizations bigger and bold.

Why: 
maybe it is hard to read because it is zoomed. 

Please explain how you would complete this step.
When you initially came to this step do you see it as a way to gather information about how to contact a representative or did you already have the representative in mind and you are trying to find that representative. Well nobody would help me, I just needed someone in the system because I had to do it myself. I had to go out to do my research, I filled it out on paper. I would have all the information and then explain what you are looking for in a box. I would ask what your grade level is, ability to communication verbally and writing, because they can match you with someone in the VSO. Personalities matter. I personally know what I need and want so I just needed someone to represent me. I know they did not understand my issues. When it asks the age you kind of have to select the client for the VSO. But when the VSO is sitting there drinking coffee and not helping it is upsetting. 

Clarify: 
no I looked for the organization first, you do not get to pick. I picked the organization than filled out the form. 
What do you look for: the culture and where it is in location to your home. When it is a younger person they like people that relate to then but some VSO are ready to retire and do not do their jobs. 

If you can put you are looking for this how would search: 
Each VSO has a specialty and a lot of women have MST. I would put what are the major concerns, I had Hep-C and hearing so I would search using the primary concerns. I would put the top four issues than it would bring the Vso up that have dealt with those issues. 

One could be the entry for claim and distance: and age it is a big factor
Why: 
you are still dealing with Vietnam war, cold war, and now you have Afghanistan and Iraq so you are looking at three different levels of age. 

### Representative Table
Please give me your thoughts on this table. Okay they are all the locations of the American legion. The one is at the VA. The rest of them I can see (reading page).

Anything needed to be added: 
Women vs. Men. Some women do not want to deal with guys. We do not have enough VSOs that are women either. 

That would help to decide: 
If I were still with MST yes it would. 

Any thoughts: 
I do not think so, you have the list but I think there should be an option to virtually seek on and do zoom. Not everyone is available so doing it online is good and it is no longer needed to have someone sit in a desk. 

### Confirming Representative
Please give me your thoughts on this step. Basically I have no problem. I would put that the scenario of what they can offer, bullet points of their specialty. Its like going to the doctor, like are they a back surgeon, ENT, is there a female available. 

### Insurance Number
Thoughts: Do you have private insurance then you would list your insurance from work , VA, Tricare or whatever. You click on the basics. 
Would prefer a dropdown: Well you have VA, Tricare, Private insurance, Self-insured. 

What do you want to see: 
Are your co-insurance, primary. Just like the normal forms they do on the others

Why that information: 
I do not think personally when you see a VSO it should have insurance. You do not pay for it with insurance.

This is not need: 
No, insurance is not part of the equation when you speak to a VSO. 

### Military Service
Please give me your thoughts on this step. 
Do you see value in this screen?

### Limited Consent
Can you talk to me about your initial thoughts regarding this step? 
I would shorten it a bit, there is too much information people will not read. Keep it simple. 

What is it for:
what you can and cannot do, what the VA can and cannot do. It is government. It is basically HIPPA to protect your information. 

If you filled it out how would you do it: 
I would click on yes to authorize the VA. That is really simple I do not see a problem. But I would have it put the initial and time/date. For the fact that you have read it, agreed, and put the initially just like DocuSign. 

What about this step needs that: 
This is more complicated because it is what you can or cannot do. This is deeper into personal information. 

Weight to this page compare to other: 
Yes. 

### Authorizes an Address Change
Thoughts: I do not trust them. 
Did you initially answer yes: 
I think you have to be careful. I like the VA and I use the VA but the VA is made out of people and people can be challenging. Like if you have an older person you may not have issues. You have to look at all of the angles. 

No due to past experiences: 
yes. Every group level is totally different. The younger ones may not trust the VA. It is easy to understand.

What helps the understanding and why: 
I would explain why the VA had the right to change the records, the reason.

Not currently occurring on that page: 
No, I cannot read it. There has to be an official reason why, when and where they do it. 

### Error Messages: 
Yeah, that is good.

## Legal Understanding - 10 minutes

## Payment History - 15 minutes
We are going to change gears a bit and look at a different part of eBenefits.
Confirm with the participant that they can see the eBenefits Payment History screen.
I am going to continue sharing my screen with you. Can you see the eBenefits website on your computer? 
So I am going to click through to the Payment History screen. Just so you are aware there is only one screen to review.

### Accessing Payment History
Do you currently receive payments from the VA? 
Yes. 

How long have you been getting payments from the VA? 
I do once a month and get direct deposit. 

Have you ever seen this page before? 
I do not pay attention I just let it run. 

How would you know there is an issue? 
I get a ping on my phone from the bank. 

How would you fix the problem? 
I call the VA directly and let them have it. I have had no problems.

No issues: 
No I have not had to track it.

Thoughts on the table: 
That is not problem.

How would you look for a payment on the table: 
Like when you use excel you can run it for the dates. Have a query for the date for the newest to oldest. 

When query to change the dates: 
Yes

Help for a particular date: 
yes. It is just like excel.

Any other way for a particular payment: 
I do not know why there would be different amounts I would think they would be the same amounts.

Is this different, are yours all the same: 
Yes. 

How often are you looking for a range of payments? 
I have not, my VA check has always been used as my house payment so I do not pay attention. If my house payment is not paid than I go back and look. Some people track it like a dog but I do not. 

Any thoughts: 
No. 

## Wayfinding tasks 5 minutes
"OK we're going to switch gears and ask you to tell us where you would look for the features we've discussed on VA.gov

### Power of Attorney
Let us say you heard that you could fill out the form to appoint a representative (the one we looked at earlier) on VA.gov. You have navigated to VA.gov and now want to find the application. Show us where you would go to find it."

You need a query base to do a questionnaire. I would do online assistance to provide issue, age, and give it more forethought of the individual being matched to the right person and customer service. If they do not do well than have them fired. 

### Payment History
For this exercise, Instructions
Can you please go back to the homepage.
"Let us say you heard that you could see a list of payments the VA has sent you (the feature we looked at earlier) on VA.gov. You have navigated to VA.gov and now want to find this list. Show us where you would go to find it."

I would go to benefits, to service benefits. That is where you get the letters and all your other stuff.

Where next: 
I do not know I would have to be driving the train. 

Overall what was done well: 
I think the website should be sent to the person that is reviewing it so that you can ask questions. 

Better if given the screen shots prior to the discussion: 
yes than go over it once the session occurs. 

Payment screen, anything to improve: 
I think you should follow the way the screens are built like a bank.

Examples: 
Like the bank statement you get each month. 

What features: 
like the time of date of it being it deposit, to from, like a normal statement.
