## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
We are going to be talking about how you use certain VA benefit features today. You will not be asked to divulge any personal health information. Before we look at the website, let us start with a few warm-up questions.
Tell me a little about your background and your service history.
Well I am retired. Right now I stay at home, I was active duty for 12 years and recently in the last 2 years have started to use my veteran benefits. My husband is a retied military officer that got out in 2010 and started through the claims and a few years ago I said it does not hurt to try so we went through the veteran assistance office and they helped me fill it out and get the process started. We are in contact with them and trying to do more claims but on hold due to not being able to complete the paperwork for the claims. 

## Document Expectations - 10 minutes
Are you currently using a PoA or representative to assist with a disputed VA claim? 
Yes. I had but once again the veteran service commission is the PoA and they are working through the American legion and submit the paperwork information to the VA.

How did you find out about this service? 
When my husband got back and wanted to update it once he moved back he used the state organization. They were hard to get ahold of so I went to a retirement conference that the county has done by elderworks and a presentation was the veteran commission and I set up a meeting. 

Can you briefly tell us what you know about VA’s Power of Attorney. It allows a person to represent me for the VA and to submit the documentation to them and receives responses. A lot of it is completing the paperwork and it is easy for her to update/correct and change what needs to be done.

It is easy on her computer: 
I have meet with her three times. 

Did paperwork there: 
yes

Fill PoA in office: 
I signed it, she filled it all out.

### Privacy Act
What are your initial thoughts about this step? It is standard, it is a privacy act and notice so you know they will not use your information for things that they are not supposed to. It is basically they will use the form as making sure I have authorized someone to speak on my behalf

### What did you see as a common first step: 
I would say this is it because it is common that they provide the privacy act and the purpose of the form and whose responsibility. 

Next step: 
probably the form. 

## VA Number (796-12-4704)
Thoughts: Good, it is standard if you have the number fine if not click the box.
Can you tell me what you know about the VA number? I know that I have a ton of communication that I can find it if I need it. The information from the VA is not always correct. When I did my appeal I got the 30 days to provide the initial information or the claim is closed. It does not tell you which claim and did not date the letter. It can be confusing if there are multiple claims and you do not know what it is for. 

Clearly state what it is for: 
well I mean you have to fill in the blanks. You could have multiple file numbers. It is something that you have been in the system before than it could auto populate but if there are multiple than you would have to fill it in.

A claim has its own file number: 
that is what I think but I do not know that to be true

If there is only one file number, and it is stored, it could be auto populating: correct, if it is the file number never changes than it should auto populate so you do not need to search for it. 

How often are you asked for you VA#?
Do you know your number off hand?

### Personal information
Thoughts: I do not personally like that the file number is the full SSN due to identify theat. Anything that it is used as an identification the concern is getting hacked especially because it has all of your personal information.

How would you like it: 
when we go to the VA they ask for the last 4, I would prefer the first 5 X’d out so it is more encrypted. 

Change thoughts from before: 
well I just do not like entering my SSN on any sites because the date of birth and the last 4 should be enough to confirm your information. I guess I do not know why you have the I do not know the file number unless you are not aware it is your SSN.

What was done well or needs improvement: 
I guess no but most people only have a mobile number so if you are not required to entre what kind of phone. Many do no take calls at work. Maybe one number than check the box which phone it is. 

### Search for Representative
Please give me your thoughts about this step. To me, I guess if you are unaware of the option you may be fishing for people to see. I guess the concern of the attorney or agent is how they are populated within the system. Not to say an attorney is bad but how do you know the quality of the person. The VSO is understood better because they do not charge a fee and they are a true representative to get through the paperwork whereas the other two I do not understand how you would go about the evaluations unless there are reviews that you can go through. Then in the stated you can go in city to lessen the amount. I hate for people to think the first step is to go to someone that charges when it can be done through organizations for free. 

When you see this you said fishing, does it make you feel like you have to go find someone: 
yes. Then I guess it I will not say a lot of it is because of the TV for attorneys. They know what they need to say to be successful but it is not always the truth for the individual. Maybe its my skeptical way. It could allow for abusive of the system. 

What about it makes you think to search for something: 
I guess if you maybe are new to the system or are frustrated with the lack of fair evaluation or leads you one way or the other. To me I guess I would select the one that would best fit there needs. It seems to me that you can go far right when they could have gone a bit left and have been fine. 

If its someone tell you to fill it out: yes because you were directed by the person you choose to fill it out. They are asking you to fill it out so they can move to the next step. I would think that organizations have it on the computer so they would do it right there and if you had conversations with them then why do it on here by yourself. 

Preference: I would place my zip code 60050

### Representative Table
Please give me your thoughts on this table. It puts me an hour or more away from my house. It would be nice that the ones closer to me were upfront instead of search through to try and find the VSO in my county. 

How would you find it near you: 
I do not know how far this goes but it should have been in my county

What next: 
I would hope that I would not have to go through all pages. Maybe I would have to keep clicking. It seems to be a lot of choice so it would take me a bit but there should have been a better way to sort like distance. I do not know if you can limit it within a certain number of miles. 

Would that be an option you would take: 
yes, I would search by the ones closer to me. 

Would you go back to limit the mileage: 
Yes because I would be here for a while. There it is, I would limit it for 30 miles. Then typed in American Legion. Yeah. So the American legion it is the first one is the one I would select. 

Improvement: 
No each system is unique so you need to know the information gets you to where you need to be. If you had the interact with the person than you know the information you need to put in to get where you want. 

### Confirming Representative
Please give me your thoughts on this step. The only concern is that I know there are multiple people that work there, will you be able to select the person or is that further down the line. Is it on the next screen will you be able to enter the name of the person I guess. 

Without the name there , would it influence the decision: 
If I am not able to put the name in yes because I do not want all of my requests filtered through a person instead of a general office. I want to deal with the same person each time for rapport instead of changing. I do not want anyone that could claim to be the American legion to get my information. 

Next step: 
I would save and continue but hope it allows me to put the name or an identifier for the person. To say that I want a person to represent me instead of just the American legion. 

If not being able to find Sue does it change the page: 
No, I guess if somewhere I can pick the name. Yes that is the organization that sponsors her to file claims. 

Additional thoughts: 
no.

### Insurance Number
Thoughts: I have no clue what an insurance number, I did not know the VA gave insurance numbers. 

Why va insurance number: 
Because this is a claim going to the VA unless this is supposed to be secondary insurance. The only other thing I can think of is that if this is what they need to get your medical records for the claim but each place has different numbers. 

### Military Service
Please give me your thoughts on this step.
Do you see value in this screen?

### Limited Consent
Can you talk to me about your initial thoughts regarding this step? I am curios why this comes up worrying about drug abuse, infectious diseases, or alcoholism.

Feelings: 
I guess I am shocked that it is this information. Maybe because none of mine have ever been related to this, normally you want the PoA to have all medical records. If you claim this on active duty and now need treatment for it, I am shocked that it is in here. 
Belongs here or does not: maybe if there were an explanation of why it is here. I would have had a better understanding. My opinion is only giving this information to the PoA is to establish the claim so I do not know if there are records within the VA why do you need them unless trying to determine if you are eligible for compensation. I do not personal believe it is there. 

They push forms to the VA: 
Correct, they use the PoA to get my old military records from places we were stationed at and civilian doctors. SO those sorts of records. I never limited to what they could or could not see. Unless you want the PoA to evaluate it to see if you have a claim. 
How would you answer this: for me it does not apply so I would but no. 

### Authorizes an Address Change
Thoughts: I guess It means if you are not able to manage your final concerns they are able to change the VA records to handle your money on your behalf. 

Feelings:
once again personally, I would select no because I am not at that point but if I could not handle my own money issues I assume that you should have the person handling your money providing information as well. You do not want someone that is in charge of a veteran to take advantage of them. 

Comfort level: 
yes and if you want to you should be able choose who you want. If I were to come in and change your own information. The only person that should be able to change the information is those I have appointment. I am more put out to say as the PoA that I need some to clarify the information

## Payment History - 15 minutes
We are going to change gears a bit and look at a different part of eBenefits.
Confirm with the participant that they can see the eBenefits Payment History screen.
I am going to continue sharing my screen with you. Can you see the eBenefits website on your computer? So I am going to click through to the Payment History screen. Just so you are aware there is only one screen to review.

### Accessing Payment History
Do you currently receive payments from the VA? Yes and no but I had to repay the severance so I am still repaying. 
How long have you been getting payments from the VA? I think it has been a year and a half. Aug of 2018 is when I did my first claim. 
Have you ever seen this page before? I have seen it and received information in mail. They say it will be repaying this but then when I will receive it. 

If so

How often are you coming to this page? 
I view it in paper form. 

How would you know there is an issue?
What would you do if you felt like there was an issue with a VA payment?
How would you fix the problem?
How often are you looking for a particular payment? If it is like a standard bank, I would do the range of dates like Jan  to Feb. there could be a lack if you receive it early. I would do the rang of dates received in a certain amount of time and that you can click on a link and gather more information. 

Another search technique if range of date were there: 
I would hope it would allow you to go back two years but go to the months you needed to or search by the dollar amount if you knew it. 

More information needed in the table: 
I am shocked they mail checks but I mean yeah. I just do not understand how someone could get that many retroactive checks. The date is the date the check was mailed or received. It would be nice with all of the retroactive one to receive a reason unless it is sent within the mail with he check. Normally when it is changed you are sent information on what has been changed with eh date and the amount that you will be getting. At least when we receive information it is but this is okay but when you see the changes are often it is sensitive.

Need more context: 
yes unless you get it with the check

Does the detail assist: 
It does not bring value because it does not explain why it is retroactive. It does not tell you it went up 10 percent. Like I said when we get mail it tells us how it is calculated. 

## Wayfinding tasks 5 minutes
"OK we're going to switch gears and ask you to tell us where you would look for the features we've discussed on VA.gov
### Power of Attorney
Let us say you heard that you could fill out the form to appoint a representative (the one we looked at earlier) on VA.gov. You have navigated to VA.gov and now want to find the application. Show us where you would go to find it."
Please sign down I cannot see it. Records, I guess I would think that a PoA would be because it is a type of record. I am not seeing it there. Okay so I guess keep scrolling because it is not there. I am not seeing where you would do a PoA. I would go back to records to see if you are able to see if it will allow you to do it

Is there certain would you think of: 
PoA, I do not know, it is not apparent to me where to go. I would go to the search bar and click on it to enter PoA. Click search and type PoA. (reading page) 

Thoughts: 
Well I do not think I want the DNR. It is not what I want. I do not know , how to click on how to apply for VA health care or the next one down. It depends on which one. 

Which one would you click: I use a VSO so I would pick that one and hope there is a form on it. I guess you would download the 21-22 form. Yes. 

What part was done well or needed improvement: O
nce again I would be shocked if you have a face to face appointment that they did not have it there for them to be in. It was not apparent but if I did the search than I would know which one I wanted to do. I would be shocked if the person did not do it in face during the meeting. No one can help you until they have the signed form. They need to send it when asking for the medical records. It is not limited to the form. 

Of the journey the important part is finding the Representative: 
correct.

No reason to look for someone else after being in the office: 
Yes, typically I would say there are few cases where you would fill it out without knowing who you are naming.

Recently done it: 
better understand you have done it than when you originally did it: I would look at it again to see if the drug and alcohol abuse is in the papers I signed because it does not always follow you. 

### Payment History
For this exercise, Instructions
Can you please go back to the homepage.
"Let us say you heard that you could see a list of payments the VA has sent you (the feature we looked at earlier) on VA.gov. You have navigated to VA.gov and now want to find this list. Show us where you would go to find it."
If you go under disability and click on the view payments than you have to sign in if not done prior.
