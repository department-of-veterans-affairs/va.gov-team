## Intro - 5 minutes
## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
We are going to be talking about how you use certain VA benefit features today. You will not be asked to divulge any personal health information. Before we look at the website, let us start with a few warm-up questions.

Tell me a little about your background and your service history.
Raised with 9 children. Went into the air force a few years after high school. Stationed in CA and had a top secret. After 3 years I was sent to England with the top secret clearance. I enjoyed my time and immensely proud to have served. It has not like today where people respect the people that have served so I am just now have talked about it and am involved with veteran groups. 

Document Expectations - 10 minutes
Are you currently using a PoA or representative to assist with a disputed VA claim?
When I initially went to a VSO for my claim file we used the DAV. I was not pleased with how it was going and the non-representation so we switched to the American legion where they were helpful. 

How did you find out about this service?
Look for answers such as friends, family, bureaucracy, approached by service
Through my former husband and he has a lot of health issues and was introduced through him because he is 100 percent disabled. 
Can you briefly tell us what you know about VA’s Power of Attorney
Not a lot because I was told from the VSO that I needed someone to represent because it is better for your claims. I did not know much about it. 

When was the last time you assigned a representative to your claim(s)?
I would say 8 to 10 years ago. 

## Discover Pain Points - 10 minutes
### Screenshare
Moderator will share their screen. Confirm with the participant that they can see the eBenefits portal.
I am going to share my screen with you. Can you see the eBenefits website on your computer? As I said before we are going to walk through how to fill out the Power of Attorney form and gather your thoughts about each step.
How familiar are you with the Power of Attorney form, also called the 21-22 form? I have never heard of it. I am not familiar with it. 
The first step we will be reviewing is the Privacy Act. I would strain my eyes because of the small print. 

***Screens***
## Privacy Act
What are your initial thoughts about this step?
What are your feelings about how the VA presents this legal text on its pages? Wow I did not know a thing about it and I don’t think I have very signed a piracy form or power of attorney. 

How often do you read the legal text in a document (sometimes called Terms and Conditions) You question in your mind because it is the government and you want to understand what you are signing before saying yes. Critical. 

How would you prefer to view the legal documents? I guess I scan it but never read it because it seems like you would need a lawyer to talk through it. 

Common- I do not get it often so being clear I do not know the last time that had legal text relating to the VA. 
Do you have any other thoughts about this step that you would like to bring up? I guess some thought would be as far as the legal rights are you giving up your rights if you sign the power of attorney or what are your rights. 
Explain why the questions/thought process- The reason in this situation is because when it comes to disability first my claim was denied and you have to prove the government wrong and its like if they come back and say you are wrong. The legality of it scares me. 

## VA Number (796-12-4704)
Can you tell me what you know about the VA number? When you get past the legal aspect, this form I understand perfectly. They are asking for my va file. This form is not completely filled with things that are hard to understand. 

How to fill it out: I would call my VSO to ask if they know what the claim number is since I would  not know what it is. 
How often are you asked for you VA#?
Do you know your number off hand?
No: How would you prefer to look up your number? (emailed / verification number) This is the number that is assigned when initially filing for a claim. I do not know where you get it but it says the VA sends it to you so you must get it from the VA once your claim has been sent.

Anything else: No because it is limited information that I would place in and then go on the next step. 

## Personal information
Thoughts- It is important information and does not ask much. You need your DOB, SSN and VA file number. I would review, ensure it is correct and move on. 

How often do you update your personal VA information? I guess when there is a major change. I moved almost 1.5 years ago so I changed the address, then got divorce so I had to change my status. I will update it when there is a change. If there is not a specific change I don’t review it.

Helpful- yes. The old email was there so updating it is important information to update. 

## Search for Representative
Please give me your thoughts about this step. I cannot read it because the text is so small. I think it is important to have a representative and to just do one online without one you might be unsuccessful. 

Please explain how you would complete this step. As I said I was at the VSO and they did it on the computer as I answered questions and reviewed before signing. I went with heir recommendations. Started with the DAV. I would want to know who the best representative is to choose. 

What information- are they responsive to questions because when you file a claim you get the paperwork it can be hard to understand. I would want my representative available to me for a quick question. 

Other information- If further information requested by the va I would like them to be available to assist for things that I do not understand and rely on their experience to navigate the waters to get to the next step of the claim process. 

Want to connect first then fill out- Yes. That is correct. 
Outside of piece of mind, other reasons- Success with filing the claim so someone that has a good track record of successful outcomes. 

## Representative Table
Please give me your thoughts on this table. Well since I cannot read it because its so small. What does action mean. I do not know what that means.

What would you think it means: action to me means do I want them to represent me without contacting me prior to going to the next steps. I am unclear of what that means. 

Would it help if it went to the next page- I think it depends on what it says under select. 
Does this help- It does because it gives me information but I do not know how it relates to action. 

What do you expect to see here- If you click select it means that you are picking that person. My miss understand is the word action because it does not clearly select this one. It does not seem like the title is clear to me. 

## Confirming Representative
Please give me your thoughts on this step. It is clear that you selected that person and their address and number are there. It is clear, no questions or confusion. 

## Insurance Number
Thoughts: Do I put my SSN, Medicaid number or supplemental insurance number. It is not clear which one they want. I would put my Medicare number but I do not know because they aren’t clear which they want. A lot of people my age have Medicare so it should specifically ask. Then ask if they have supplemental insurance. 

## Military Service
Thoughts: Noticeably clear and if you can’t figure this out you are in trouble. 
Value: I do not know if they still provide service numbers. Here does it mean your service number or your SSN. I do not know if they still assign them. 

How would you fix it: if it is your SSN than it should be called that but I think it should be your SSN. 

## Limited Consent
Can you talk to me about your initial thoughts regarding this step? I do not know what limited consent. I would say it is only a certain amount of time that you provide the representative. If you are giving a representative consent I do not think you should have the option to opt out to that and all records should be available because when an applicant does not want someone to see anything it raises red flags. I guess I do not think it should be part of the form all medical records should be available. 

How easy is this screens information to understand. It seems to me that it would be scary for a lot of people, the person may be uncomfortable if they had one of the issues. They may be physically uncomfortable with the choices under options. My personal situation they could look at anything they would like. I do not think the options should be there all information should be available. 

## Authorizes an Address Change
After reading the step’s title What are you expecting to see on this page? It is clear what they are asking for, it is a yes or no than move on. It is a good question and most people would answer and move on. 

How easily is it to understand the steps objective? The large letters make it clear what they are asking and the red asterisk make it required to submit and it is only a yes or no. the bold heading is great and makes it clear, 

How would you prefer to display information?

## Error Messages: 
This is important because when filling out forms it is easy to miss stuff. This is good because if there are errors there would be a red x instead of a green. 

Length: I think that it was okay, not to long. Other than the one form which the options for providing information, not wanting to include that in there. It is good. 

What worked well: it was easy to understand, the one page to select the representative was not clear until you click select. Other than the conditions that you do not want them to go into t was user friendly.

Any parts the form was confusing: recent service number, is it the old one or the new one or the SSN. I do not know why you would have more than 1. It should also have your SSN. It would be clearer if it were like that. 

Confusion hinder the purpose of the form: Yes, as the service number question because I do not recall see it asking for the SSN. 

## Legal Understanding - 10 minutes

## Payment History - 15 minutes
Thoughts: This is obviously once you have been in the system because you would not be getting a payment.
Do you get payments: yes direct deposits and have been receiving them for about 8 years. I never go look at the payments because I have no reason to.

Why: Because each year you get your cola and the increase, if changed I would go look at it. If there were a major life change I would go look but if not I would unitize this page. 

How to check: I just know they would give me my payment. If I had a question I would come here and see. It has gotten a lot better since I started. When I started we did not have eBenefits. Once I got signed up to access the information it has been much easier. I would monitor it when I have a new claim  to see the change. 

I am going to continue sharing my screen with you. Can you see the eBenefits website on your computer? So I am going to click through to the Payment History screen. Just so you are aware there is only one screen to review.

## Accessing Payment History
Do you currently receive payments from the VA? I go to my bank statement.. I like looking at the upcoming appointments. Benefits is such a helpful tool, if I had more payments or had questions I would look at ebenfits 
I would sign on than look at my choices so I would go to the ebenfits and look at account activity to see the changes that are there. 

How to search for the changed: look at payment history. I would look to see if it changed when I got divorced to see if it changed. I would go into the history. 

### Table Features and Attributes
My next set of questions will be centered around the Payment Table features.
Helpful to see the tablet: You should have the option to look, I think this works well. I think the way it is currently is fine to chose 

how far you want to look back. 
Comfortable with choosing the time frame: Yes. 

Helpful: Yes because it provides me the recurring payments and the retro active payments are labeled. It allows you to know that changes. 

Anything to add to help: I cannot think of anything I would do to change this form. 

## Wayfinding tasks 5 minutes
"OK we're going to switch gears and ask you to tell us where you would look for the features we've discussed on VA.gov
### Power of Attorney
Let us say you heard that you could fill out the form to appoint a representative (the one we looked at earlier) on VA.gov. You have navigated to VA.gov and now want to find the application. Show us where you would go to find it."

I cannot see what is on the bottom, okay there we go. (reading page). I do not know where we would go I would think it would be under disability. I would click file a claim for compensation. (reading page). This is overwhelming I would be stuck at this point. 

What would you do? Start searching 

Where would you look: I would scroll to the top to look where I can search for the key word representative. I do not see a search box. 

Thank you.

### Payment History
For this exercise, Instructions
Can you please go back to the homepage.
"Let us say you heard that you could see a list of payments the VA has sent you (the feature we looked at earlier) on VA.gov. You have navigated to VA.gov and now want to find this list. Show us where you would go to find it."

I would go the search up at the top to the payment history to see what it would give me. I would click on the first one. Yes that is what I would do. Then I would go to ebenefits. 

For the representative I would use PAO representative. 
Do you feel like is helpful- No because I do not see where it has it as a title where it shows PAO representative.  
Thank you.
