- Every vet knows what VA file number is
- No, veterans don’t go to eBenefits 80% don’t know how to use it
- They don’t realize what the tools are
- Personal info is OK, it’s really good, it has the major things
- Good that they can change the info

- Expects select to “pick” the VSO
- expects green check indicate there would be an electronic submission

- Says Yellow box instructions exactly as expected for non-electronic VSOs
- Wouldn’t base decision on having to mail-in form
- Still doesn’t realize he’s in the form
- wants a button to pre-fill a 21-22 form
- Doesn’t understand insurance question, it’s not clear what insurance
- The form doesn’t ask for any insurance info
