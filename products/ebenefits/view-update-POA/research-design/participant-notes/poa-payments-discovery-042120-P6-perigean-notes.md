## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
We are going to be talking about how you use certain VA benefit features today. You will not be asked to divulge any personal health information. Before we look at the website, let us start with a few warm-up questions.
Tell me a little about your background and your service history.
Former DAV employee but have been retired since 2014. 
I am 24 years army retires, when I retired I started working for the VA. I worked there 7 years and because of my disabilities I retired. I do volunteer for disabled veterans for assisting with claims and benefits. 

## Document Expectations - 10 minutes
Are you currently using a PoA or representative to assist with a disputed VA claim? 
I do, I have DAV. There are my service organization. 

Can you share your reasoning behind electing a representative for your claim?
Who did you end up choosing?
Is that an attorney or a VSO?

How did you find out about this service? 
From working at the VA. On the website itself they talk about and then veteran to veteran stuff when I originally did the claim.

Other veterans first: 
yes and even when I talk to veterans now I tell them to have someone represent them and not to go at it alone. 

Can you briefly tell us what you know about VA’s Power of Attorney. It has a veteran filing a 21-22 form and it provides access for the records and make decisions for the veteran on behalf of their claims, assist with appeals as their advocate for anything that they need at the VA> 
When was the last time you assigned a representative to your claim(s)? For myself, many years back probably 2012-2013. 

## Discover Pain Points - 10 minutes
Screens
### Privacy Act
What are your initial thoughts about this step? 
I mean if you read it yes, but 90 percent of the veterans do not read it. If they understand that we will not sell their information and it is protected, we won’t use it for anything other than their benefits.
Does it explain it: To be honest I have never even read it. 

At the current state is it clear: 
Yes. 

Why: 
It explained right out If it can be larger that would be good. Okay that is good. 

Initially you stated the message is clear, what was: 
That any information gathered would only be used basically by the VA and not given to other sources. 

Other thoughts: 
Nope

### VA Number (796-12-4704)
Thoughts: Nothing it is clear and every veteran should know their file number. Most cases it is there SSN. If they do not have one they can check they do not have one. Noticeably clear. 

What do you like about it: 
It shows up how a file number is and explains where it is

### Personal information
Thoughts: It is good and to be honest many veterans do not use ebenefits to include myself I do not use it often. Like last year we dealt with 28k veterans at the providence medical center. A lot of them do not utilize ebenefits. The personal information is good because you can change it and many veterans change things is being able to change it here is good so they can make sure all is right in the system. 

Veterans do not use it often and you help veterans with claims, do you know as a worker , do you see a difference in people using it, PoA more or less: 
No, I would say 80 percent of veterans I have helped don’t even use ebenefits or know how to use it. They do not realize the information they can get out of it and if they say they have it they still do not realize the tools there. 

Improvements: 
I think it is really good, it is the major things like contact information. Making sure their contact information is good and the ability to change the information is excellent.

## Search for Representative
Please give me your thoughts about this step. I like the dropdown for the state. Finding the agent that will meet their need (reading page). That is good because it explains the options. 

How often is the charge brought up: 
Mostly on appeals. Veterans will come in after being denied so they go see the attorney but I explain to them that they can charge the fee. They won’t take it unless they have someone for them, they can only take a percentage of the back payment so much won’t take the claims. That is how I explain it to them because they do not like the outcome process. 

How often does this happen or unaware of the fee: Most of the time they will go with a VSO. 
There are reasons why they are guided so sometimes they may want to talk to the attorney. Some cases are impossible to prove so maybe they need to see the lawyer firm, it is not often. 

Please explain how you would complete this step. 
Mostly word of mouth, I switched from one to another because I was not happy with their work so I changed to DAV.

Did you have different search criteria: 
Basically by sitting with them and interviewing them. I could see the difference between the first and the second PoA in knowledgeable. I do not know how you would do that with a computer.

Want were topics spoken about: 
How familiar they were with the appeals process and what they think about the appeals and talking with other veterans about how they were handled. If a veteran were using the website all the time it would take more data, by listing the success rate of the organizations. If a veteran were looking at it they would have something to go off of the first time around. Just general information would help the veteran, maybe by region or state so you can see which organization is helping the most or best results. 

Other topics outside of success rate and knowledge: 
Yeah, attitude was big. I know I sat with one and you can make someone feel like you want to help or they will just fill out the form. I work with DAV and the VA I know when I talk to a Vietnam veteran they may say Diabetes but I will talk to them about other medical issues than to help. 

Anything else: 
I do not know how current the numbers are and I do not know the main thing if it is updated constantly with name, phone. it can be frustrating if they call and the number is disconnected. It needs to be updated constantly. 

### Representative Table 
Please give me your thoughts on this table. (Reading Page) 
The information is up to date there. I have never even looked at it to be  honest. 

### Confirming Representative
Please give me your thoughts on this step. Someone wanted the American Legion so they went to the regional office . I do not know if they moved.

When asked to select this what did you expect: 
I am not sure how this works not, if they save and continue would that take them to the 22 form.

Do you expect that to happen: 
I am not familiar with the purpose so I do not know how this is going to work. It would not automatically send anything to the American region to get in contact with you.

What do you expect: 
I would expect for after saving and continuing the 22 would come up . almost prefilled because you are logged in so it would build it for you. If I had someone else it would be like a change, so I had DAV but want these guys so I save and continue that it comes with an automated one that goes to the VA than the service organization and they would have it electronically. 

Why do you feel like it should do that: 
For the veteran it save them form having to go there or the VA. They could do it at night because if they work during the day. No one else can do it because they have to login with their password and the PoA would get it electronically so they could know they would have that veteran as well.

Selecting produces a form that send to VA and PoA, do not see it as choosing someone, what about that indicates that is occurring: 
When I see the PoA and the number, and address. I do not know the electronic receipts but I think it is set up for them to electronically set up the notification and it would occur. If they were not in the system yet than it would not let me because they cannot get the 22 electronically so it would instruct to mail it. Like someone of them allow me to electronically send the 22 PoA Form so click that and its pre-fills. Then another button to confirm after reviewing than enter to sign and submit. 

Did you have someone in mind or want information on it: 
I am not familiar with the screen. When you see accept electronics requesting I do not know what the check marks are. My first thought is that they can become my PoA electronically so selecting them the 21-22 would come up to sign. 

The other ones, thoughts here: 
That you could not and it would only provide the information on eligibility.

This table has two purposes for you, one side it provides and sends 21-22, if it does not have the green box it provides information: Correct. As soon as I see accepts electronic requesting they will do it electronically. The check mark allows me to complete it electronically. 

Is this what you are looking for: 
Yes. That is exactly it. 

Would this be information that would make your decision: 
No.

It does not matter if it needs to be mail: 
No, it does not help make a decision, most decisions are based on their needs. If they are a Vietnam veteran they may want someone within the same area to assist. 

What next if you see this: 
It would be nice to see a button to click here for VA form 21-22. If a veteran gets this far they can click here for va for 21-22, it is easy. It comes up and they can print it where they are. 

Link to provide the 21-22: 
Yes. If that was in blue and you click on it you can complete it right there than print it out with all of the information for the PoA.

Beginning thoughts: 
Okay with this it is good on how that works. The option for them but not being able to do it electronically but it provides how to complete selecting them by mail. 

### Insurance Number
Thoughts: What type of insurance? I do not know it is not clear. What insurance, if you have Tricare it is your SSN, if it is Medicare than it is the Medicare number. 

Is it helpful, do you ask: 
No because the hospital and DVA stuff, even on 21-022 it does not ask the insurance stuff and the VSO do not need the insurance information so I do not know why it would even come up. 

### Military Service
Please give me your thoughts on this step.
Do you see value in this screen?

### Limited Consent
Thoughts: I am familiar with this part.

As a veteran and helping: 
Yes I filled it out and it is part of the 21-22. It is providing whoever you make your VSO the authorization to get the records. You are able to opt out of the mental health it is self-explanatory. It looks like what we are doing by checking this off it is doing the 21-22 electronically.

Is that what you feel: 
Yes. 

Does it change anything: 
no, I do not use the system but as we go along it is making sense. 

Step had an impact, which part: 
Looking at it, you can check off the authorization and save and continue. 

Before you did not feel that, what about this save and continue made a difference: 
It is really clear of what we are doing. 

### Authorizes an Address Change
Thoughts: That is really good. 

What is good: 
Being able to allow the PoA to do the change.

Why: 
Because a veteran if they try to call and cannot get though or do not know how to. At the same time I assume by saying yes the PoA’s can get the change of address completed to. If they sit with you and you do a form and realize that the address is different they are able to update the information for them.

Benefit as the PoA is able to update the information: 
Yes. I think it is good. I think of the categories of veteran. A competent veteran would be on ebenefits.

What do you mean: 
To be able to change addresses with identity theft, I think it is good for the authorizations to change the address. The service organization can pull it up and those are things they notice. It helps the veteran and the PoA if they have to send them something.

### Error Messages: 
That is good. Right off the bat , there were no errors but there is a warning and it tells you. You have limited the VSO. To go back and correct it how would I do that, arrow back.

What would you do: 
I would arrow back. 

Where to: 
I would not know where and the average veteran would not know either. If you could click the warning to go back or something to review the warning. It should have a click here to change the option, a link to change the option and they can change it and save it. If they do not get warnings than they have completed it the way they want. 

### Legal Understanding - 10 minutes
What are your thoughts on the length of this form? You can buzz right through this fast. The average person could go through this pretty fast, this is good. 

Better understanding: 
Yes and without go further into it, I assume that this would do what I thought it would. It would generate the electronic 21-22 to the system to the VA ands to the VSO. It is really good. 

What worked well or did not work well when navigating through the Power of Attorney application? 
It worked really good. 

After walking through this form can you explain to me what this form legal purpose is for?
Do you feel you have a better understanding of this process after filling out the form?
How did you apply for a Power of Attorney?
Are you satisfied with the method you used?
Did anyone assist you in filling out this form?
What issues did you run into while filling this form out?

## Payment History - 15 minutes
We are going to change gears a bit and look at a different part of eBenefits.
Confirm with the participant that they can see the eBenefits Payment History screen.

I am going to continue sharing my screen with you. Can you see the eBenefits website on your computer? 
So I am going to click through to the Payment History screen. Just so you are aware there is only one screen to review.

### Accessing Payment History
Do you currently receive payments from the VA? 
Yes. 

How long have you been getting payments from the VA? 
Since 2005. 

Have you ever seen this page before? 
Yes.

If so
How often are you coming to this page? 
No through here but I have not used it in a long time but I have in the past. You can see the payment and the date. You would be able to see reimbursement and things like that. It tells you want it is and if it is mailed. 

Payment history anything sent by them: 
Yes. Like if you have an appointment, they pay you mileage. I assume you would see that in there as well. 

Do you prefer to check your VA payment on your bank's website or the VA? 
Most of it is electronic and you have to have direct deposit. I know they send out a letter for awards or anything that goes on. I see a lot of guys go to the hospital and they may have changed their banking and they do not get the payment because they changed banks and not get the payment. I would look at returned payment so I would look down there and it would say and provide the reason like a bank account closed. 

You assumed, but what would you do: 
I would click on returned payments. I would assume that if it were due to changing banks that the returned payment would be listed there with the information with amount, date, what it was, and reason why. 

What about in the payment section: 
When it says type I do not know 

How would you fix the problem?
How often are you looking for a particular payment?
How often are you looking for a range of payments?

### Table Features and Attributes
My next set of questions will be centered around the Payment Table features.
On average, how many payment items would you like to see displayed?

How would you search for a particular payment you are looking for?
Sort, filter, text input of fuzzy math, auto-complete suggestions, date range searches

Can you please rank the table headers from most import to least important?
Is there anything on the table that we could remove without preventing you from completing your task?
If so, why would that information in particular not be necessary?
