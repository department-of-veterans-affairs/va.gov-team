## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

## Document Expectations - 10 minutes
Are you currently using a PoA or representative to assist with a disputed VA claim?
Actually the VFW got involved in my claim back when I filed it in 2001. They actually got it approved which did not get it approved until 203 and I began to get my VA disability. I think if it were not for them it would have taken longer. 

Can you share your reasoning behind electing a representative for your claim?

How did you find out about this service?
I think it was the American Legion. I did not know they were involved until I received an email that sated they were my representative; I did not ask them to they just got involved. I do not know how they did. I did not even know that I had someone that was working with my claim.

##Privacy Act
What are your initial thoughts about this step? 
It is a lot of reading. If you make it shorter, it seems like it is a lot of reading just to get to the next step. My opinion I like the simple to the point than once you get into it than explain it more. 

What are your feelings about how the VA presents this legal text on its pages? 
It is a lot of information that is not needed. I think it would be better if it were shortened. With the military we deal with a lot of information and it is easier if it is simple and to the point. 

## VA Number (796-12-4704)
Thoughts: Simple and to the point. It should have the SSN instead. 

Can you tell me what you know about the VA number? 
My VA number is your SSN. I do not know if it has changed or not but it has always been your SSN. 
Done well or could be better: I do not see any problem with it. 

## Personal information
Thoughts: It provides you all of the personal information that you can ensure that it is correct. It is nice to know your information is correct and you can make changes which is even better. Say you just moved and you want the VA to have the current information so it is nice that you can change it right there. 

How often do you update your personal VA information? 
I do not really need to I have moved once in the last 5 years so I keep all my information the same but it is nice to look and be able to change it if you need to. 

How often does the VA have the wrong information? 
I have only had one time when the VA did not have my correct information. 

Can you remember when you were filling out this form if there was any personal information missing that would help speed up the process? I do not think there was to much information. Like I said it is the simple basic information. I think that the information on there is simply fine. 

## Search for Representative
Please give me your thoughts about this step. This is pretty much to search for on that is near you. It is good to be able to find one that is close to you, not everyone has internet access all the time so it is nice to find a local on where you can go to them to talk instead of over the internet. Area is important. 

What are you seeing on the page: You are looking for someone to represent you the best and for your needs. Searching for an organization that will best fit your needs. 
Clarification, not knowing who you are looking for but looking for someone to help. : Correct

Please explain how you would complete this step.

When you initially came to this step do you see it as a way to gather information about how to contact a representative or did you already have the representative in mind and you are trying to find that representative? 
I guess what their specialty is I would say. Here they have if you are looking for an attorney for legal issues or for assistance with a claim. Or the other one is the American Legion, VFW’s. The people that have experience with the issues that you are having. 

Specialty trump distance, why: 
I think it depends on the issues at hand. You have to weigh the pros and cons; do you want an attorney that is the best within their field or how far they are from you. Can you select more than on type of PoA. 

Why would you be interested in more than one: 
If someone had an issue that was more complex and it had more needs like needing an attorney and claim agent or VSO. You want more than just one issues needing more than one person as well. 

## Representative Table
Please give me your thoughts on this table. It was hard to see it. So this is pretty much a list of lawyers that are in AL no less but it just provides the address, number, and name of the individual. The veteran would have to call the lawyer to see if they deal with their issues. 

Please explain how you would select a representative from the table.
What information would you expect to find in this table? 
This is just a list of all attorneys within a 50 mile radius it does not show you what they specialize in. Like veteran issues, etc. The veteran would have to call each on to ask if they deal with VA Claims. It would be good to have a block that says what they deal with. 

Do you see the list as just attorneys; Yes

Is there a thread that they have in common or just attorneys: I do not know; 
I just see the attorney and the VA just provide a full list of just attorneys. Even if it was a small box after the name that shows that they are veteran friendly. 

We are looking at the form of gathering information about someone, how would fill it out: 
I do not know. I still only see it as a list of attorneys and do not see it ask I do not know. 

What would you do next and why: 
What is the action button. 

What are you looking for: 
In my opinion I would search for something else because my impression is that it is just a list of all attorneys in AL. To me it would be looking than calling all of them to see if they specialize in VA Claims. It just adds a step to what you are doing. 

## Confirming Representative
Please give me your thoughts on this step. It pretty much tells you want the last screen did, you clicked select on the person and provides the same information.

Feeling about the page: 
It is a waste of a step.
Why: 
It is the same information as the last page. It is the same information but it is the individual than click save and continue to the next page. It is a useless step I guess. 

## Insurance Number
Can you tell me what you know about the insurance number?
How often are you asked for you insurance #
Do you know your number off hand?

## Military Service
Please give me your thoughts on this step. This one they want your service member idea and branch of service; do not they already have it. Wait this is just confirming, saying it is your information. If it is correct in the first screen why do you have to confirm it again. It is another repetitive step. 

Do you see value in this screen? 
All it is doing is confirming you branch of service and service number so it should be correct because it was confirmed when I first logged in. You cannot really do anything on this page so why would it matter if it is correct or not. It is a useless step.

How would you fix it: 
call the VA as it says right here. What is the point of updating the information if you will have to call the VA to update the information anyways. Some pages are useless and make the process longer. 

## Limited Consent
Can you talk to me about your initial thoughts regarding this step? 
This is a release of information and giving permission to the VA to release your medical records to the representative. This is a good consent form to have here and it lets the veterans give the VA permission to sent the records. This is a good thing to have on here. 

What was done well: 
It lays out all of the authorization that you are giving the VA and it provides the opinion of what to include and what not to include to sent the representation. It provides the veteran with a choice. 

Similar to the privacy page in the beginning: 
The first page was all black and white whereas this page separates what you are reading or highlights the important things the veteran needs to do. The first page was black and white whereas this page is broken up.

How did it help: 
It makes it stand out. 

## Authorizes an Address Change
After reading the step’s title What are you expecting to see on this page? Did the VA have to put this in here because the PoA changing the Veterans address? 
Why do you think there as an issue: 
The only reason I say that is why would the Veteran have to authorize the address, the only person that should change the address is the veteran themselves. That is why I was wondering why this is in here unless the PoA was changing information without the veteran’s knowledge. I would be clicking no on it anyways because the PoA representative is not being used to change your information that is not why you should have them. The only person that should be changing the information is yourself.

## Error Messages
Thoughts: 
It is good to have because someone I make errors when filling out things and you want to ensure everything was filled out so it does not delay the application. I like the error check page. 

## Legal Understanding - 10 minutes
What are your thoughts on the length of this form? I do not think it is bad but the only thing I have an issue is the repeated pages. If you have the information page at the beginning what is the point of having the few extra pages in the middle when you have already confirmed or made changes at the beginning. Why do they keep putting in pages to confirm the information. 

American Legion did it: 
Yes I never did and. When I first found out that they were my PoA I called to see how they got involved and they said they were working with the VA to go through the claims. If there were claims that took a while they were getting involved to assist. 

## Payment History - 15 minutes
I am going to continue sharing my screen with you. Can you see the eBenefits website on your computer? 
So I am going to click through to the Payment History screen. Just so you are aware there is only one screen to review.

### Accessing Payment History
Do you currently receive payments from the VA? Yes I get 40% through the VA. Whenever I login that is one of the things that I look at while I am there. I do that just to make sure that everything is there. Sometimes the payment information can get hacked and that is one of the things I look at to make sure that my payment is the right bank account and everything like that. I also have to pay the VA back so I look at how much has already been paid off. 

I go to ebenfits to check just to make sure everything is correct and if I need my VA letter for something I can go on there to print it out.
How do you like to check- 
I go to the payment history and it pulls up when you click on it. I will show each month I receive it and it shows me how much I got. Yes what you just did. 

What would you do if you felt like there was an issue with a VA payment? 
That is another reason I go on. If I notice in my bank that the VA changed my amount I can go on there to check and see why it changed. If I do not understand something that is on there I call the 1-800 number to talk to them. 

How often are you looking for a particular payment?- 
not often. 

How often are you looking for a range of payments? 
That is why I like this page because I can look from the time that I started getting the payment. 

Anything to make it better: 
No is provides all of the information that you need. It is simple. What is on there now is perfect. 

## Wayfinding tasks 5 minutes
"OK we're going to switch gears and ask you to tell us where you would look for the features we've discussed on VA.gov
### Power of Attorney
For this exercise we are going to ask you to share your screen. I have added the Zoom's screenshare instructions to the chat. The chat icon can be found in the lower part of the Zoom app's window.

Let us say you heard that you could fill out the form to appoint a representative (the one we looked at earlier) on VA.gov. You have navigated to VA.gov and now want to find the application. Show us where you would go to find it."
I would click search and look at power of attorney. That is what I would do. 

What are you thinking: 
We may have to put more.

Why: 
Its just bringing up other information and not actual the information that we want to fill out but instead the directives. I think where it has apple it is just for ebenefits. 

How do you feel about the results: 
They are a little better

Why: 
it is for the applications and not just the power of attorney. It has the veterans Vso information and instructions so you know what you are looking for. I am sure there is an easier way to look for this.

What would you do: 
I would go back to the home page: (reading under disability) With the PoA they are looking at the claims so that is where I would look. I was looking at where you can check your claim and appeal status. 

What was done well or not done well: 
Searching for it was not done well. If you click search for a PoA it does not take you to where you need to go and I think the first page if there was a link under disability that would be good for claims representative or PoA.

Search results lacking: 
Yes

Anything else: 
When you are requesting that claims representative they may want to look at all of the steps that go through it and there are steps that are useless. 

### Payment History
For this exercise, Instructions
"Let us say you heard that you could see a list of payments the VA has sent you (the feature we looked at earlier) on VA.gov. You have navigated to VA.gov and now want to find this list. Show us where you would go to find it."
I would scroll down and under disability click view payment history. Then you have to sign into your benefits.
