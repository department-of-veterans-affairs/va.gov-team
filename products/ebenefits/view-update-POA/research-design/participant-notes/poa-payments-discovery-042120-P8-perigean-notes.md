## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
We are going to be talking about how you use certain VA benefit features today. You will not be asked to divulge any personal health information. Before we look at the website, let us start with a few warm-up questions.
Tell me a little about your background and your service history.
I was medically retired in December 2017. The process for medical retirement took over 3 years. 

## Document Expectations - 10 minutes
Are you currently using a PoA or representative to assist with a disputed VA claim? 
Not a PoA and I used VSO’s through the entire process.

Can you share your reasoning behind electing a representative for your claim?
Who did you end up choosing? 
I used the VFW, DAV, and appointment someone at the VA

How did you find out about this service? 
Word of mouth but the assistance by the VA was appointment while being medically retired.

Can you briefly tell us what you know about VA’s Power of Attorney I am not familiar with it at all.

Why VSO, over an attorney: 
through the medical bought we are appointment an VA CFC and a PEB attorney. They were paid by the government. Not really impartial. The VA CFC is great and helped me through the appeals and an advocate for the solider. 

Close together: 
yes

Assist with forms: 
Yes they did all of the forms. One form was do not badly because she did it how she wanted to and not how it was supposed to be and submitted it without my signature so I had to provide them the correct out.

When filling out the forms, together or on the same screen: Both but mostly us sitting down together and I had to bring in the medical claims that have even been resolved and we need to claim it so the VA checks it out. The one person said we cannot claim things that had been fixed but I said no it still needs to be claims. When I changed to the second person they would have me review prior to submitting. Out of the claims he would separate them than have me resign. 

## Discover Pain Points - 10 minutes
Screens
### Privacy Act
What are your initial thoughts about this step? There is a lot to read and comprehend. It depends on the person if they are able to due it based on their capability. I have a few friends with TBI’s and would not have been able to complete it. They would have cancelled out of it. 

Overloaded: 
Yes. I prefer it in three screens

How would it help: 
one that you would be reading the privacy act, then click on the notice than click on the respondent burden but ensuring they know they have to read them

What is most important: 
I am not familiar with respondent burden so that is the most important.

Why: 
not as familiar with it. Most places have their privacy acts where they are standard. The respondent burden, if you tell them upfront what it is they may or may not have the capability to do it on their end. Must be transparent so they know how lengthy it will be because they may not want to do it.

What is the second step and why: 
Just to fill out the personal information when you login

Why login: 
you are already in the system and have started a claim.

### VA Number (796-12-4704)
Thoughts: So I did something similar to request for my representative and it was worthless. He did nothing because of being overloaded.
What part is worthless: When I was trying to get advice if I should appeal the initial reward and told to do it this way. He only worked part time and he had beliefs on what someone’s claim should be. He was with the VSO. He was not helpful at all. 

When you first did it, were you by yourself, difficult or easy: 
I had someone help me so I would say either or. They walked me through the steps. 

Can you tell me what you know about the VA number? 
It is your SSN.

What needs improved or was good: 
I am old school so I prefer my SSN over the DoD ID numbers because it is confusing. Requesting for representation, you can request but they have an understanding of who is priority and who is not. 

Organizations think this: 
Yes. 

### Personal information
Thoughts: It is standard for the military. It is not a bad thing. I am resistant to the DoD ID number but understand why they do it but having to learn extra ways to login it difficult. I like that the SSN matches the VA file number. 

Other thoughts: 
I think if there is a PoA appointment it should be on this page and who it is. 

Explain more of why: 
It would let you know the level of comprehension or competency of the individual if they have a PoA it would let them know if they need assistance. 

VA knew your current or prior PoA and want it presented: 
Yes I think it should be transparent. 

If you were doing this form to find an attorney, would you like to see prior PoA’s: Yes if there is any PoA on file it should be recognized. If it is for medical care it should be linked to this form so you can see the expiration date and their capabilities. 
Vetting process: 
If I have a PoA it may be for specific things but they should know I have a PoA document for any case I might have.

If you have someone you like, you had their information from a pervious one and placed it here, would it provide more confidence about the form: 
I don’t know about confidence but it would be a good record keeping that I used them in the past so why not reach back out to them to ask guidance or advice. With all of the military moves some PoA’s get lost but if the online form is able to collect everything. There should also be a way to have it taken away if they no longer want the person involved if you find out things did not not occur how you expected.

### Search for Representative
Please give me your thoughts about this step. I do not remember seeing this when I went through the process. I remember being able to search for it but I do not remember finding a PoA through one of these places. 

What are thoughts about the step than: 
That I would explore it more because I do not really know. If I pull up a state will there be 2 people for 100 options. If there are only 2 people I would be caution because there are only 2 people for the entire state that you can get in contact with to interview. 

Amount of people per state, anything else expected: when you place the state information, I would like contact information and what they specialize in. 

What would you expect to see on the screen to complete the task and why: 
When you are looking for a PoA, you should see primary and alternate decisions you make and the physical documents loaded onto the screen. Since your claim is Electronic and on file you should be able to see the PoA on file as well. 

### Representative Table
Please give me your thoughts on this table. I am familiar that some of the places are Vso. There are a lot of pages. What is the checkmark is for. I would scroll to the top. It is an electronic request that they accept. It is frustrating that they do not have numbers especially when just given a P.O box.

Why frustrating: 
because sometimes it is nice to talk to a person when needing help. Also if they have a P.O Box are they a physical organization or not.

Impact: 
Yes because I like to sit down to talk to someone and provide the information to. Look at the first person, it does not have a number and doesn’t take the electronic requests but you have to send it to a P.O Box. How did they make it onto this form. What happens when you click select you do not know where they are location and you can’t call or email so it doesn’t make sense that they are on this form. 

What happens when you click select: 
That it is the person you pick to be assigned to and do not have other options. 

Lack of information is frustrating; distance play a role: to some extent but the organizations that I am familiar make a bigger impact. In my case, I am an MST so I prefer not to work with men so who am I selecting. Until I became familiar with my second VSO, it was a male so before I trusted him I did not present all of the medical concerns. It is about transparency. It goes back to the first page when I think it needs to be broken down. It is all about transparency. 

### Confirming Representative
Please give me your thoughts on this step. You selected a random VSO but not a person. On the screen you do not see if it is a male or female that you would be dealing with. It is not transparent. 

If you were here without the name what would you do: 
I would try to call than search again. I would have to spend hours to see if I were going to be with a male r female. 

Hoe did you find Charlie: 
I found one with the VFW, his hours were not convenient and he was overbooked that I had to find a new one. It should show if they are accepting new cases/clients. 

Some done: 
yes. You can spend a week leaving messages than have to go back to the drawing board. 

### Insurance Number
Thoughts: I do not know what insurance number means; I do not know what that means. I would enter my SSN because it is my case number. I also have multiple types of insurance so I do not know if they need it for the case. 

### Military Service
Please give me your thoughts on this step. 
Do you see value in this screen?

### Limited Consent
Can you talk to me about your initial thoughts regarding this step? 
I think it looks familiar.

How so: 
The authorization of a complete stranger to have access to the medical records was alarming especially since I did not have a good VSO until the second one.

What part stood out to you: 
The start select authorization; it is the most important words on the screen for me. (reading page) it does not say anything about MST. That needs to be there because it is just as private as past drug or alcohol issues. I understand that the list can go on and on. 

How would you complete this form: 
The optional restrictions do not apply to me. Personally if you are holding things back when doing the claim it is the first VSO that would be like it has been resolved so it does not need to write it down. You do not know if the optional restrictions will lead to additional claims. I do not hold things back because you never know. The second VSO would always leave his door cracked out of both personal safety and security. 

### Authorizes an Address Change
Thoughts:  I would click not the PoA cannot change my address.

How did you come to the conclusion: 
Because when my father was my PoA during deployments he would receive information and not show it to me so I never knew about it. 

Explain what this step means to you: 
that I want to ensure that I receive the amil from the VA is communicated to me and to my address.

Would you think it would be if the PoA change the address: 
Yes it would be a potential issue s if the PoA made a P.O Box I did not know about. 

More in the driver seat: 
Yes. 

What if it were for them to update the information that needs to be updated: If it were my health than they would be authorized if something drastic in my health changed. 

### Error Messages- 
what are warnings, what would be detected.

What do you think it would be and why: 
I have no idea. When you are requested representation, do you have the ability to ask if they have the ability to assist with cancer, etc.

Warnings about Vso: 
Yes. 

Why: 
it has request for representation, may if their case load is full and not taking new clients. It says they have no errors. 
How often were you using the title to asset with the steps: it is the first thing you should read so. The titles were helpful sometimes but here I do not have errors so I assume it is correct. I just do not know what the warnings are.

## Payment History - 15 minutes
We are going to change gears a bit and look at a different part of eBenefits.
Confirm with the participant that they can see the eBenefits Payment History screen.
I am going to continue sharing my screen with you. Can you see the eBenefits website on your computer? So I am going to click through to the Payment History screen. Just so you are aware there is only one screen to review.

### Accessing Payment History
Do you currently receive payments from the VA? 
Yes.

How long have you been getting payments from the VA? 
2018

Have you ever seen this page before? 
Yes. I received money in my bank prior to being told I was getting paid.

How were you notified: 
In a letter from the VA. 

Often bank first: 
no but it was a nice enough difference to check to see what was occurring. When the bank ahs an 3k increase you have to ask what happened. 

Were you waiting for notification, what steps did you take when you saw the money: 
When on active duty to get a purposed amount than when you retire you get a finalized amount. While on Active duty and you go through the Medical process you get a recommended percent and then you need to expect to see a certain amount than a third part goes and reviews the case and then you get your payment., 

What brings you to the page: 
I go here to find my claims and appeals status along with ensuring my information is correct.

Familiar with ebenefits: 
yes. 

How often are you looking for a particular payment? 
I do not look for them not they are consistent. When you retire you are told that you will not get paid for 1-2 months. The va pay arrived before my military retirement pay so you do not actually know the date you will be paid due to the second review.

How would you search for a certain payment: 
click on payment history. Is what we are in than you pick the timeframe. I do not know why you had a mailed check when you have to provide a bank account for direct deposit. 

How to search for the payment: 
use the dropdown and click on all. Then click filter. You just had a payment within the last 3 months but then when you click all you do not see anything. Why do people still mail checks. I received a check for mileage but I was waiting to see if I got more.

What would you do: 
I do not know I would have gone here than called friends. All my friends get direct deposit. The 27 dollar one was probably for travel. 

How often are you looking for a range of payments?

## Wayfinding tasks 5 minutes

## Post-Task Interview
OK, those are all the screens we are going to look at today. I just have some closing questions for you.

Any questions you have for me? There is a lot of things that can require different treatment so I do not know, one thing I have not seen where the burn pit registry is. 

Why would that be important: it can be based off of the claims you have so you can make a claim but I do not see where it is on there so I don’t see the burn pit registration. 

Thank You and Closing

We appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is extremely helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it works for Veterans.
