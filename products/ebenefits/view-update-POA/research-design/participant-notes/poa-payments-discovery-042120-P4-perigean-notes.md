## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
We are going to be talking about how you use certain VA benefit features today. You will not be asked to divulge any personal health information. Before we look at the website, let us start with a few warm-up questions.

Tell me a little about your background and your service history.
I was a paratrooper from 1976 to 1985. That is my basic honorable service. I got out of the army and then was commission in the Air Force in 1988 than in 1991 I was in a bad situation and got a felony and received another than honorable. I can only get benefits from my Army service. I went to prison than got out and I have my college degree and went back to work. I have 4 children and a wife, life is wonderful. I am working from home and my wife is working from home as well. My oldest child is special needs because we cannot take our daughter out due to her being high risk. The family is here and we are really enjoying it. I am a developer and an analyst so I have been home for two weeks and will be home for at least 3 more weeks. 

## Document Expectations - 10 minutes
Are you currently using a PoA or representative to assist with a disputed VA claim? 
So I actually was using a VSO than lost confidence in them and did it myself on benefits. I did pretty well and got it done and there are a lot of message board like veteran benefit networks. All are veterans and I got a lot of help and I met a guy that was a VSO. He helped me and gave me advice than about 7 months ago I switched my PoA to DAV. I have met with them a few times but I am not sure they are really helping me either. I have claims that have been decided not to be favorable to me and I would like to move forward with it.

### Privacy Act
What are your initial thoughts about this step? 
I think for most people that is a lot of reading, I know the privacy act stuff is required but most people will not read it and just move on. 

You have enough information from the past: 
Yes anytime you see the terms of service or privacy act you have seen 50 times before your kind of just want to skip over it. When I buy things I will read the manual the first time but if I get it again I will not read it again. 

## VA Number (796-12-4704)
Can you tell me what you know about the VA number? 
Well this stud is really good. It shows you how to put the number or if you do not have one you can click I do not have one and continue. It is a good page. 

Do you know your number off hand? 
When I was in service it ended up to be my SSN. Like my father that was in in 1956 he had a service number that is not his SSN.

## Personal information
Thoughts: This is just a page to bring up the information. It is good to check if everything is correct. I normally would read through it to ensure it is correct.

How often do you update your personal VA information? 
I want to say I do not actually need to change it. I have not moved or anything like that. It may have been prompted, so I have updated it a few times. I have been working on this stuff since 2016. If I would have known earlier I would have used it earlier. I am blessed to be a veteran and have the benefits. 

## Search for Representative
Please give me your thoughts about this step. It is clear and concise. You pick the state and move on to other information. I like that it explains you can have an agent, VSO, or an attorney. A VSO is free and an Attorney will charge money. It is pretty simple and clear.
Thoughts that you would use for searching: for me being in NE you would only get one result. I was looking to sign the DAV you do not need to search for counties because there are not that many here as there are in other states. If I were in TX, CA, or NY there might be more options

Helpful: 
Well I remember when I did it, it was really easy to find the DAV because 10 or 12 things popped up. I think there may be one more thing that pops up. If you put in the zip code you would get the Douglas county one. It is helpful in a small county but if you do CA there may be thousands that come up. 

Where you looking for a certain person or looking to find one: 
After a phone conversation he told me before they could do anything I needed to complete the PoA because they have someone qualified to look online but they have to be assigned if they do not have permission. Looking for a certain person. 

Anything else on this page: 
Nope. 

## Representative Table
Please give me your thoughts on this table. This table is a good example. It can go to 17 p[ages whereas when I did mine there were only a few entries and it was easy. If someone looked at this they may be overwhelmed. It could be better by putting it into groups and subgroups. 

Could we provide help when overwhelmed: 
This one says choose a PoA, it looks like they are all lawyers, were they looking for a VSO or veteran organization. Maybe if they could pair that. 

Is the title misleading: 
That is a good point. As far as the VA is concerned it could be anyone. I try to think of this as me being a brand new veteran and I want to see if there is potential for a claim. I ask if I need a VSO, Veteran organization, or attorney. When I started I did not know, I started by calling and making an appointment. This is a new person and the worst thing they can do is use a Lawyer because of the cost was Veteran organizations are free. 

## Confirming Representative
Please give me your thoughts on this step. Basically you picked on and not you click save and continue, After this there may be more information to connect with the person. It makes sense and is pretty simple. 

What brought hesitation: 
I guess it does not because you read through the list and now you have one that you are using. This is asking if this is the one you actually want. This is really good. 


Do you see value in this screen?

## Insurance Number
Thoughts: I did not know we put in an insurance number. This would make people ask what they are asking for. I know that I have health insurance through work they also bill my work insurance because it is logical and they should not have to pay for it all. You would need to know what type of insurance they are asking for here. What is the reason for it? More information needs to be added but why do I need my insurance here at this step. Unless they needed it for some reason I would delete it and skip over this step. 

What would you do next; 
we would skip this instead unless there was a reason they need it now. If they do need it now I would place an explanation here to explain why they need it now. If looking for a PoA when I could provide it when actually going to the VA for services up until then they do not actually need it. 

If you did provide it would that be a problem: 
if I were new at this I would want to know why I had to provide it. I would but a reason why they had to provide it at this point. 

Would it stop you from filling it out: 
I tend to follow the chain of command but things the VA do I trust them and they have been nothing but great to me. The ebenefits website is a bit redundant there may be a reason why they need it. If I were doing this I may make a call to see why they need it. 

## Military Service
Please give me your thoughts on this step. This is just confirming you service information that you already put in. It seems very redundant. Me who were in two branches of service will ensure they are clicking the correct one that they have benefits for. 

## Limited Consent
Can you talk to me about your initial thoughts regarding this step? 
Like a lot of stuff on here it is kind of long. If you take the time to read. I think those things are important if you want to go to the VA for services like a disease or an alcohol issue. I am not even sure that needs to be involved at this point but instead at a later time. You may provide authorization for records but the restrictions, if someone is representing you in claims that the medical records should be shared. I am not sure that the optional restrictions should be there. I know there are a lot of veterans with issues that they prefer not to share. That is just my thoughts. 

How easy is this screens information to understand.
It is easy to understand but the problem is that my perception in the technological age we like to click something and move on. This is profoundly serious in itself and governed by federal statues and the person needs to know of their rights in accordance with the laws. 

## Authorizes an Address Change
Thoughts: To be honest, I think I always check no. I do not think they need to be able to change my address. I think I need to read the whole thing. I would still check no on this because my wife would be managing things like this instead of my PoA. But other than that it makes sense. In general people do not like to give away their power to other people. They are trying to pick a PoA and we have not met them so why trust them. I have my wife to do things for me and she is entitled to everything of mine. 

This question is too intrusive: 
Yes. I think at the end of the form it has all of this in it. Maybe it is there and you do not want the VA to maintain three different authorizations. I think you could move this and be able to change it at any time. 

## Error Messages, it is always good to know that you did it right. 

## Legal Understanding - 10 minutes
What are your thoughts on the length of this form? 
If I am just going to find a PoA than it was long but the government needs to have all of this. If it could be shorter that would be good. 

What worked well or did not work well when navigating through the Power of Attorney application? 
We talked in the beginning about selecting by date maybe to use a free VSO or an Attorney. A check box prior to going to the list and an explanation that attorneys will cost an amount whereas a VSO is free. Other than that is was fairly good. 

Did you prefer doing it or have someone else: 
I like doing it myself because I know what I am filling out and signing. 

Peace of mind: 
Yes probably. The VSO did a lot of things and had me sign it but did not give me copies. I think anything I am part of I deserve a copy of. 

Maybe you in the driver seat more: 
Yes.

## Payment History - 15 minutes

Confirm with the participant that they can see the eBenefits Payment History screen.

### Accessing Payment History
Do you currently receive payments from the VA?
I do yes.
How long have you been getting payments from the VA? 
I started in December of 16. The first claim was decided in April of 17 so since then. 

Have you ever seen this page before? 
Yes.

If so

Do you prefer to check your VA payment on your bank's website or the VA? 
I am the type that learned how to balance the check book. I sign on my bank at least 3-4 times a week then I hold on to my receipts and balance it and check that my deposits are there. 

Bank account to see payment: 
Yes.

Why are you coming to this website instead of your bank? 
I look here sometimes and I can check 3 months, 6 months, or all payments. 

How would you fix the problem? 
I have not had any problems with payments. In the way things have worked for me since I have done a few claims, as it gets closer to being decided va.gov shows you when it should be decided. When I logon and see it has been decided I can check here than it should be in the bank in a day or two but I have not had to complain about a payment. 

How  are you looking for a particular payment? 
This shows the last 3 months, it should show the last three payments than the 6 months , 1 year or all. They are in order of date from the start of the payments. If it is a decided claim and it being closed. I will not see the letter for 2 weeks but I can check here under disability and know my rating so I would know how much I should have. Then looking at payments I could see it here. My bank normally shows it prior to this.

Efficient in what it provided: 
Yes. There should show more payments because she ahs more than one. I think this is actually good, it provides information for you to see and you can total it up and it is all in one place. 

No information that you need: 
no not really because it says mailed check, mine says direct deposited and it should go to my bank. 

## Wayfinding tasks 5 minutes
For this exercise we are going to ask you to share your screen. I have added the Zoom's screenshare instructions to the chat. The chat 
Let us say you heard that you could fill out the form to appoint a representative (the one we looked at earlier) on VA.gov. You have navigated to VA.gov and now want to find the application. Show us where you would go to find it.

Okay so I would click on search and place PoA or spell it out. 
I would spell it out because it is clearer and concise. 
Things do not always have abbreviations in there.

How do you feel about the page: 
Their searches are always horrid but each time I search I get tons of information that go outside of here. You have all of this information and need to be more specific in the search. You can scroll down and see PoA and VSO instructions. I would think that is what I am looking for so I would click on that one. That does not look right, I do not see the form. I would go back up to the search bar and I know I want a PoA than place form and search again. 

What about now: 
Well its not giving me what I want there. I said specifically PoA form so nothing else should be there. It is not bringing up what I am asking for. 

What next: 
I would scroll down more than I would click on the VSO/PoA instructions. Now it has the VA forms. I would click on the form but it is not the one I need. 

You choose the same link twice, what spoke to you: It says VSO/PoA instructions and that is what we are looking for but it does not provide the link to assign someone. 

## Post-Task Interview
OK, those are all the screens we are going to look at today. I just have some closing questions for you.
