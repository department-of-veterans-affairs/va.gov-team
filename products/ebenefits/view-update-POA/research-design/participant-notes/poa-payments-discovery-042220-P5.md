[ NOTE: Raw notes are unedited; some cleanup required ]

- Navy for four years
- Son in military
- Worked as contractor, FEMA
- American legion is VSO rep
- Found contact a challenge
- Would recommend Veterans use rep
- Went to DAV back to AL
- Pick someone because they have organization and access they are liaisons
- Have to be able to do it yourself
- Found reps are not very good, not helping people
- POA give them access to your records
- Reps need to explain form
- Filled out form 2013 or so
- Privacy act is too much… summarize
- Thinks privacy act is like HIPPA
- Confuses privacy act text with consent text
- File number is SSN (not really)
- You want it simple
- Audience doesn’t have time
- Sometime audience is challenged mentally/emotionally
- Likes progress indicator calls them “tabs”
- Likes linear path, step-by-step
- Wants to highlight titles (bold labels)
- Gets to search screen
- Make VSO font bigger
- Had to do own research
- Filled out paper form
- Explain what you’re looking for 
- Wants self-assessment on cognitive/communication/emotional/personality to match with Veteran
- Looks for Organization first, then completed form
- Criteria: culture, location, lot of factors, age, specialty (women’s issues, claim details)
- Wants to match VSO to primary concern (women, back, PTSD, etc.)
- Age is a big factor: Generations Viet Nam, Gulf war, war on terror
- Needs to find VSO virtually Zoom
- Wants more info about VSO, summary of services
- Just like doctor: specialty, details, women, etc.
- Confused by insurance question
- Wants details or options in dropdown
- Would offer more complete insurance info
- Insurance shouldn’t have anything to do with VSO; not even part of the equation
- Remove insurance-does not apply
- Simplify and summarize limitations of consent
- Would click YES option
- Wants initial and time/date; force user to view info
- This is a little more complicated it gets deeper into personal info
- No! I don’t trust them. Wouldn’t give permission to change address
- Every group level is very different
- Way VA needs right to change your address
- There needs to be an official reason
- OK with error check

- Does not pay attention to payments
- Gets notice from bank on bank app
- Calls VA directly to solve problem
- Never used eBenefits to view payments
- Payment table is OK
- Wants to use table like excel
- Want to query date but changes to sort…
- Doesn't know why amounts would be different
- Amounts are all the same for P
- Never looks at range; doesn’t pay any attention
- Some people track payment like a dog
- Wayfinding… looks a big blocks
- Would go to benefits… service member benefits
- Would like to get the screens ahead of time
- Send session questions ahead of time
- Follow the way bank app look like a bank statement
- Just like a regular statement
- VA is in 1980’s
