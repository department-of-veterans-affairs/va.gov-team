## Intro - 5 minutes 

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Candy Clark and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about using representatives to assist the claims process.  

Before we start, a few things I want to mention: 

- **This entire session should take about [30 minutes].** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic. 

- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. 

- **You'll be interacting with a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. 

- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**  

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.  

    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**  

  

*Start recording.* 

  

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?  

  

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes 

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions. 

 *Background info about the participant should have been provided by Coordinator already, so use this time to ask any other questions that you feel will help with the session. This warm-up is not required*] 

- What is your service background? 

- What kinds of benefits have you applied for? 

- What was that process like? 

    - [If they indicate that they had a representative] How did you find your representative? 

`NOTE: TASKS ARE TBD AFTER RESEARCH SCOPE IS FINALIZED` 

## First Task: Wayfinding - < 5 minutes 

- Please share your screen with us. 

- Now go to va.gov 

- For our first task, I’d like for you to imagine that you are interested in finding someone to help you with you apply for disability compensation. Where would you look for someone? 

  

### Things to watch for: 

- Where does the participant initially look? 

- What elements does the user look for or interact with?  

    - Do they use search? 

    - Do they look under myVA? 


## Second Task: Contact current representative - 5-10 minutes 

- Okay now we’re going to move to our prototype. 
- `If using staging, add link and log in here. If prototype, add prototype link.` 
- Continuing our earlier task, imagine some time has gone by and now you have already appointed a representative, but you need to contact your representative.  
- You’ve come to this page, what do you do now? 
- Follow up questions:
    - Is there another way you would expect to be able to contact your representative?
    - What contact information do you expect to be available?
    - Where would you go if you needed more information?


### Things to watch for: 

- `start page tbd` 
- Does the user correctly identify their current representative?
- How would the user contact their representative?
- Does the user expect an email address?
- Does the user feel they have sufficent information to move forward?
 

  

## Third Task: Change representative - <5 minutes 

- Okay, great. Let’s move on to our next task.  

- Some more time has gone by and now you want to change your representative. 

- What do you do now? 
- `If testing View functionality only` Follow up questions:
    - We are not going to log into eBenefits right now, but what would you expect to see when you click that link?
    - How would you know who you wanted to appoint?
    - Where would you expect to find their contact information?


### Things to watch for: 

- Does the user find the link to [eBenefits OR Search Rep]? 
- Does the user expect to be able to search for a rep or that they would already know what the contact information would be for the new rep?

`If testing View functionality only, end here. If testing combined functionality, add search and appoint tasks` 

  

## Post-Task Interview - <5 minutes 

- TBD based on test scope 

- Any questions for me?  

  

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes 

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans. 

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session?  

    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.  

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
