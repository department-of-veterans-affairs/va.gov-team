# Research Plan for eBenefits Migration Team, Accredited Representative, December 2021

`DRAFT PLAN`

## Background

When a Veteran, Service Member, or one of their dependents needs help filing a claim, they can choose to appoint a Veteran Service Organization (VSO), attorney, or claims agent to act on their behalf. There are three basic functions a user needs to be able to complete: searching for an accredited representative, appointing a representative through filing a VA Form 21-22 (to appoint an organization) or VA Form 21-22a (to appoint an individual attorney or claims agent), and viewing their current representative.

Currently, searching is done through the [Office of General Counsel](https://www.va.gov/ogc/apps/accreditation/index.asp). Veterans can then submit their VA Form 21-22 through eBenefits or through a VSO, or their VA Form 21-22a through their selected Attorney or Claims Agent. Once the form has been signed by both parties and accepted by VA, the appointed representative has (limited) access to the Veteran's benefits and appeals records, and the Veteran can view their representation in eBenefits.

The purpose of this project is to streamline access to accredited representative information and migrate features from eBenefits to va.gov. The View Representative tool is primarily informational. The Veteran can see who the VA has as their current representative, along with location and contact info for that representative. The search and appoint functions are designed as a single form that will allow the user to find a representative and then continue to enter their information to generate a pre-filled VA Form 21-22 (if they select an organization) or VA Form 21-22a (if they select an attorney or claims agent). The veteran would then need to submit the form to their representative for a signature.

### OCTO Objectives

The View Accredited Representative tool will support the following objectives:

5. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information

6. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

7. Veterans and their families trust the security accuracy and relevancy of VA.gov



The Search and Appoint form supports:

1. Veterans and their families can apply for all benefits online

3. Logged-in users can easily track applications, claims, or appeals online

4. Logged-in users can update their personal information easily and instantly



### Veteran Journey

Veterans are likely to be impacted through the “getting out”, “starting up”, “taking care of myself”, and “aging” parts of their journey. This tool will matter most when Veterans need help applying for VA benefits, or when they need to appeal VA decisions.



## Research Goals

For the view functionality, the primary research goal will be to ensure users can view their appointed representative. We'll want to know if users are satisfied with the info presented--is it sufficient? Do they understand any next step in contacting or changing their representative.

For search the search and appoint tasks, we will seek to understand how users search for accredited representatives and how users proceed through the appoint task. We want to know if, and when, users expect to speak to a representative and how they expect to be able to submit their completed form.

### Outcome

This research will allow us to understand where there are problems in the search and appoint forms and allows us the opportunity to refine steps and content.

### Research questions
- Where do users expect to find their current representative?
- Can users quickly and easily identify their representative?
- How would users reach out to their representative? Is there sufficient information to do that?
- How do users expect to change their current representative?
- Do users understand the search options?
- Can users refine their search if they don’t find the representative they are looking for?
- Do users expect to talk with a representative before appointing them?
- Do users understand how to select a representative?
- How do users respond to pagination when there are many search results?
- How do users expect to submit their completed form?
- When do users sign in?

### Hypothesis
- Users will initially look for information about accredited representatives in the white quadrants
- Users will expect to find their current representative in their profile.
- Users  will find the presentation satisfactory, but may want additional contact info.
- Users will be able to find a link to eBenefits to update their representative but may not understand the process to do so. (For View functionality only)
- Users will be able to link to search and appoint tool to search for new representatives.
- Users will be able to proceed through the search form but may not understand the type of representative option.

## Method
Research will be conducted through moderated, remote usability sessions.

### Location
Sessions will be conducted remotely through Zoom.
