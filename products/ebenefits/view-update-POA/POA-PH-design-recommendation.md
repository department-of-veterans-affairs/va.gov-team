## Power of Attorney
- Make sure the Content page's FAQ helps veterans clearly understand the overall process of the form. Veterans were confused by what the "next steps" were after completing the form.
- Instructions should be clear and written with common, everyday verbiage. Reduce the use of legal language to inform or to instruct Veterans. There is a high probability that Veterans will not read the legal text or will struggle to comprehend it.
- Remove the Representative Search feature from the form. It may be easier to have a step where the Veteran enters the Representatives information instead of searching for it. 
   - This step caused a lot of confusion for the participants. 
   - Maybe have a separate flow that stores the selected rep that can be applied to the form once the Veteran starts the form.
- Break apart the Privacy Act step. Veterans saw this step as a wall of text and would not read it. Veterans were comfortable with the Privacy Act information but did not read the Respondent Burden section. 
- Combine and auto-populate all Veteran information steps (VA File Number, Military Service, and Personal Information).
- Participants wanted the Representative Search Table to include: a rating system based on Veteran feedback, the representative's specialty, representative's name, and the number of cases won, 
- Provide verbiage about the last time the table information was updated.
- Ensure that the statement below or something similar is incorporated in the Limited Consent step because Veterans understood the intent of the step after reading the statement. 
> “Though I give my consent to the VA, I do NOT want the POA Representative to access records relating to the following treatments.”
- Participants asked that Military Sexual Trauma (MST) be included in the Limited Consent step. 
- Provide a statement regarding how the Veterans may benefit from the Representative changing or updating their address. Veterans are fearful and lack trust, and saw the request as relinquishing control and a breach of trust.

## Payment History
- Veterans favored their bank's website features and layout over the current Payment History.  
    - Incorporate a search by a range of dates. Veterans did not know when the VA sent a payment, and a range would help them locate a payment easier than a sort feature.
    - Combine Payments and Return Payments into one ledger. Veterans are familiar with a ledger with debit and credits. 
    - The Disclaimer text is confusing and poorly labeled. Creating a FAQ section may make the content more palatable.
    - Display the Veteran's financial information on the page:  
       - The Veteran's bank
       - The account linked to their direct deposit
       - Link payments to their claims
