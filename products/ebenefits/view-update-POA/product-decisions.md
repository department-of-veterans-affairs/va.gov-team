## Purpose of this document

This is to help guide and memorialize decisions made about different functionalities and behaviors for the feature we are working with.  

- [VA Form 21-22](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/vba-21-22-are.pdf): Appointment of Veterans Service Organization as Claimant's Representative  
- [VA Form 21-22a](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/vba-21-22a-are.pdf): Appointment of Individual as Claimant's Representative (Attorney, Claims Agent, etc.)

## Questions for Stakeholders

**Things we are curious about for Representative stakeholders**  
  
1. Workflow for the form:
- Where does it originate? **Veteran or dependents, caregivers, etc.**
- Where does the Veteran send it? **The Veteran must complete the form (electronically or paper), and submit it to their chosen VSO.** 
- From there (**the intended rep**) it goes to **the VSO who will sign and send on to VA (often via a VA "upload portal").**
2. What system(s) is/are used to send now? **We heard there is an "upload portal" to send the 21-22; eBenefits was mentioned once, SEP came up.** What is expected? **VA receives the form, then allows the VSO open access to the veteran's health records and claims (minus and restrictions). That's pretty much the sum of what the form does: POA so the VSO can see what the Veteran sees.**
- Is there regular downtime on partner systems for things like scheduled maintenance?
- Is the Office of General Counsel responsible for managing the system/process? **OGC is responsible for accreditation of representatives. Unclear if they manage Representative selection or open access to Veteran files.**
3. What is the appointment process?
- Where or who set the rep in CorpDB for the Veteran
4. How long does that take?
5. How often is the list of accreddited reps updated?
- It seems that email address is preferred for initial contact (reaching out directly), is that collected and available? Or will it eventually? Is it a spam risk?
6. Is there a place to determine if the application is pending?
- Do we need to manage its status?
7. How does SEP play a role?  
- Is it just another portal for VSOs to use?  
- Can we get a walkthrough?  
- How many are using SEP?  
8. Is there anything on the form(s) that is not necessary?  (What is the minimum required fields for successul addition?  
9. How are reps removed? **Representative POAs can be terminated when the Veteran or Rep sends a letter to VA stating POA is revoked/terminated, or when a Veteran selects another representative by submitting another 21-22. There is no automatic expiration (death?).**
10. For VA use only, do we need to address this?

</details>

11. What are the largest pain points?   
- What would make things easier for the Veteran?   
- For VA?  
12. How does Direct Upload play a role in this application today?   
- Centralized Mail?   
- We have heard of SEP, Direct Mail Upload, CMP, Vets Pro, VBMS, CAG  
13. Is it necessary that the forms be PDF'd and uploaded to eFolder?  
14 .Another requirement is the "fee arrangement" doc that needs  to be submitted with a Veterans request 

**TL;DR - what does this mean?  what do we do next?**
