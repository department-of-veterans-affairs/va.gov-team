1. In the Yellow Ribbon app they have functionality to update the query parameters in the URL. This is most likely so that someone can copy and save the URL to run the same search at a later time. Do we want to include this in POA search?

| pros | cons |
|------|------|
| would allow users to copy URL | adds a lot of extra code and time to build |
|                               | until we test it we are not sure if users will even use the feature |



2. Can we be provided a mobile design first as mobile will be more difficult to build and will most likely account for the largest segment of traffic?

3. When a user clicks the "select as representative" button, what happens next in the UI?
