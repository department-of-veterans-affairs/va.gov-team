# SAHG Product Outline & Transition Document

- Contact Oscar Hines ASAP
```

## Overview
The Specially Adapted Housing Grant feature is a transactional form ([VA Form 26-4555](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-26-4555-ARE.pdf)) to submit a request for money to modify a home for special needs.


## Problem Statement
Veterans with special needs around the home can submit this form and get grant money for changes that need to be made.  This form needs to be brought into the VA.gov digital experience and be made available quickly and easily.


## Desired User Outcomes
- A Veteran should be able to come through and quickly and easily submit this form to be deemed eligible for money via grants.

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Failed submissions or lack of communications on activities or status

## Desired Business Outcomes
- Increased conversion and exposure to the Veteran population.

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Decreased conversion and exposure to the Veteran population.

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_
* _**Limit 5-6 KPIs per product**__

| Category | Ease of use | Service completion | Trust/Satisfaction | Health |
|----------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |

## Assumptions
- This will present as a straightforward migration to VA.gov but curerntly uses an iframe within EBN that will need t obe integrated into an API for the downstream system (SASHA) to accept.
- More details in the [/research-design/](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/ebenefits/view-apply-SAHG/research-design) folder

## Solution Approach

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

### Initiatives
*Include initiatives (iterations, new features, etc.) to improve this product. See the [Initiative Brief Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/product/initiative-brief-template.md)*
