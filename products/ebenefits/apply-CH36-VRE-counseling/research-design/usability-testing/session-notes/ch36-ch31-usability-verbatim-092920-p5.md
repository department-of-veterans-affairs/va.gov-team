Unknown 0:04
Okay. Is it alright to have your permission to record the session. Yes. Very good. Thank you. All right, we'll start out with a little bit about you. And if you could tell us maybe a little bit of your service history,

Unknown 0:19
and maybe some experiences that you've had with the VA.

Unknown 0:23
Um, yeah I served in the Marine Corps for four years and traveled to several places, wonderful, wonderful places in the middle of nowhere. And after I got out. You know, I wanted to you know do work with the VA and because I had struggles, just like several other veterans that um, you know what, as soon as they got out it was a hard transition because the foundation that we had in the military was not there anymore. And we had very little direction afterwards. I mean I guess it's just you know you figure it out by trial and error of trying things after you get out but it was just a hard transition.

Unknown 1:09
So, You know, I started working with a nonprofit

Unknown 1:12
organizations Wounded Warrior Project dap, and the VA and then a few years later after 2008, I came to VA to start working, and I moved on up. Throughout my career ladder. And I'm actually involved in a lot of web design and improving the patient overall patient experience. Even for like caregivers and, yeah, just, I mean it's a wide range of things but

Unknown 1:45
it sounds like you're really

Unknown 1:48
extremely qualified to be helping us out with this.

Unknown 1:51
Yeah, I saw it I was like oh yeah this would be perfect.

Unknown 1:55
I'm looking forward to this. That's phenomenal. So you actually are employed by VA at this time.

Unknown 2:01
Yes. Okay.

Unknown 2:03
Well, we were just contractors for VA and we're part of a team of the DSA team that is proving via DACA. So that's our connection to it. Personally I've worked in VA for about five years now on different projects. Yeah, now be there. It's great. Okay, well I appreciate you telling us that. So you're familiar with va.gov. Yes. Okay. The benefits have become without saying,

Unknown 2:30
Yes.

Unknown 2:31
What's your personal experience with that have you used the tools that are on the benefits and maybe some of the America. Yeah,

Unknown 2:39
yeah, Yeah. Have you used,

Unknown 2:42
and the experience lease with EA benefits I mean is it something. It's a little hard to find a few things on there. But I mean, the transition over to vets.gov

Unknown 2:56
like that is a

Unknown 2:58
lot easier to navigate you're definitely.

Unknown 3:02
That is our goal. All right. Um, so would you mind sharing your screen with us. And once you get that set up, go to va.gov. Yep. Okay.

Unknown 3:27
Sorry I just had to

Unknown 3:30
allow women there's

Unknown 3:32
blocking on here. Right.

Unknown 3:55
See, let me know if you can see

Unknown 3:57
it on the air and

Unknown 3:58
the Sir, I do see it going to be a darker. Yep. Yeah, just read our home screen. So you mentioned that you went through the process of transitioning out of service into civilian life and you kind of felt like you were a little bit of a drip. Did you ever go through chapter 31 or chapter 36 benefits. Did you ever get those.

Unknown 4:25
Yes, I did.

Unknown 4:26
Okay, so you know, pretty much what we're talking about when we bring those terms up. Yeah, because back to being extremely well fried. So, okay, well, just imagine you were told, word of mouth. Somebody said yeah you can get benefits from VA things that will help you to training, find a job. Career Planning, those sorts of things. And you land here on the homepage. Yep. What would you do to find out more, or try to apply for those sorts of benefits

Unknown 5:00
to things. I mean,

Unknown 5:01
definitely, of course, go down here to the

Unknown 5:04
education section. Right, or

Unknown 5:08
search for it out there. Okay.

Unknown 5:12
There's another option here but I don't know why it just wouldn't automatically go there.

Unknown 5:18
No, that's fine. Whatever your, your reflexes. I mean, which would you go to first thing nobody's looking at you and you're just like I want to get to this step right away. What were you doing first English

Unknown 5:30
education, just call a jet.

Unknown 5:33
Yeah, that'll be the first spot that I will go. Okay. If you

Unknown 5:37
roll down the page, go ahead and just click on the link that you think will take you to information about these benefits.

Unknown 5:48
I mean, I would want to click here where it says that's,

Unknown 5:54
yeah for the next day I would check does it apply for education benefits. I mean probably wouldn't be the same screen, but, you know, I think if that first icon or link this area or here was the link that

Unknown 6:08
would help out or is

Unknown 6:10
just another way to get people to click on, that's a

Unknown 6:14
right. Oh, I agree with that, and that's those are the sorts of things that we surface in these sessions, it's not necessarily the focus of what we're doing here but it is, you know, it's good information we put that into our, our follow up or summary in our analysis. So when you come to this page. What on this page tells you about job training career educational sorts of benefits maybe chapter 31 or 36 Theater those terms.

Unknown 6:44
I have I will look at possibly eligibility but I think most people will probably click GI bill because it's just a more common term. The chapter 31 chapter 33. I don't even think it'll go into that. Yeah, I mean they may know it when, but like for me. When I was in service I paid for the chapter, or the GI Bill extension or whatever the plan was but after that I didn't hear anything about the GI Bill until I was getting out but you know by then it's like, Alright I'm just ready to get out of this.

Unknown 7:21
I don't care, I'll figure it out later.

Unknown 7:24
Okay, with that in mind, because it's really good insight right there. And if somebody said just in general, hey there are these sorts of benefits. You think people would know them by name, or would they know the like the statute chapter 3631. What's your sense how people identify those benefits how they

Unknown 7:45
call.

Unknown 7:46
I think they just reference them as rescue referred to them as the GI Bill benefits. That's it. I mean, even better I know veterans, either served with or just you know people who are veterans and they're like, GI Bill benefits, they always refer refer to it, even for those family members even my brother, he just retired after 20 years and he just reversed his

Unknown 8:11
GI Bill. Okay,

Unknown 8:13
now that's good to know that is important to know. Okay, so what on this page, tells you about your eligibility or gives you have to actually go and apply. Do you see anything that would go to that

Unknown 8:29
site or on this page or do

Unknown 8:31
you want to see what I meant.

Unknown 8:33
Yeah, if you were just to come to this, and just follow your nose, and click whatever you think is the right way to go, doesn't matter where

Unknown 8:43
you're standing anywhere on the screen

Unknown 8:44
yeah I would probably go there, or this on the left hand will apply. Okay, go ahead and click that,

Unknown 8:53
whatever you may have collided him, and we'll see what pops up next. Okay. Now, looking at the screen and thinking about career benefits. Career Planning, job training those sorts of things. What on here would let you apply for those sorts of things.

Unknown 9:15
Oh yeah, see the qualifications here to be in the program,

Unknown 9:21
or you know, it'd be so good, I could apply for it, but I'm sure I

Unknown 9:26
would have to go look deeper to see if I have those benefits still

Unknown 9:38
average should be down here.

Unknown 9:41
This is more details.

Unknown 9:52
What are your thoughts as you're looking at all this information, scroll bar impression.

Unknown 9:56
It is a lot of information.

Unknown 10:01
Um, I mean I'm, I know the the GI Bill one, you know, education benefits but in most cases, this is why I know a lot of people they get confused by the, you know, so many so much information stacking the one in most cases or this one to apply, you know, or see if they're eligible on how can I apply. And, you know, then go on to the next step of

Unknown 10:25
the process. You're just giving me like a perfect segue so what I'm going to do at this point is put a link in the chat box. Okay. And we will go to that second thing I was talking about we're going to walk through the prototype. Okay. So before you click on anything this looks very much like the site that you were coming from, and it's a, we'll call it a seven Function. prototype. There are some things that are clickable links and things that are not the things that we're walking through are pretty much clickable. And if you were to click on something and, you know, feel like, oh, it didn't go the right direction. Don't worry about becoming stack up. So taking a look at this. Let's, let's say in this particular scenario you with your qualifications, heard, and with your history, your background. You are good there is a benefit that you might qualify for and etc on job training career counseling and those sorts of things. And you've come. And we'll worry about how you'd have there you know later on down the road you've come through the va.gov home screen this.

Unknown 11:41
What would you do.

Unknown 11:43
Once you Your first step.

Unknown 11:44
Well if I add.

Unknown 11:48
Let's see. I mean I would click here to see about going to the next step. But I'm applying for personal career planning guidance. Is that like a common term that's used or not turn rely on term or phrase. Yes, and I don't think about.

Unknown 12:11
Chapter 33 or you know GI Bill.

Unknown 12:15
Yeah, that's actually very good feedback your question is a good one. I can tell you that this is the you know the form of their 2018, or into the program, behind it is called personalized career planning and guidance, and you've been creating and you've been in the military so you know everything's in Evernote so this is PC PG. What I'm hearing in your, in your feedback is you're like what is this. So, does that. Looking at this does it kind of create some confusion, what was your sense when you ran into that.

Unknown 12:53
Yeah, definitely, it seems like it would be a whole different benefit. I'm not like educate you know again GI Bill related, it's more like, you know, just something else a different program. So, and this is common throughout all VA but we don't use consistent in terms, which causes a lot of confusion for people just like in this case, just like when we say healthcare benefits or Compensation and Pension people merge that stuff together all the time because the process. One is admin and others you know healthcare related. So, like, you know, it's just a consistent consistency would

Unknown 13:36
help out because a lot of veterans a

Unknown 13:38
lot of this stuff at the VA is very

Unknown 13:41
overwhelming for them.

Unknown 13:44
Yeah. I think you have hit on something that we do here quite a bit and Arsalan, you know, working on this content design. We're, we're collecting as much of this feedback as we can. We're trying to channel that and get some clarity in what we're working on. So, that's where we'll be back. So what this is the 20 to 32 is. It's, in addition to, or along with GI bill, which is chapter 33. So if you'd heard that you have potential additional benefits for chapter 30 for your GI Bill. Walk us through what you would do to apply

Unknown 14:25
for that battleship.

Unknown 14:27
Alright, so I'm gonna click now here of course.

Unknown 14:32
And then,

Unknown 14:35
see, then this is the another alien seems like we're using chapter 30 was that specific to like GI Bill, I mean I know chapter 31 is but is this like local rehab type of thing.

Unknown 14:51
The answer is, but it's it's what it's called now. Right. All right, and so just to capture that point on, you know you've found that another confusing term is that our understood Yeah,

Unknown 15:06
yeah,

Unknown 15:08
because again now we're referencing as me I know this is specific like if you're sorry. If you're involved in that. Are you signed up for the veteran readiness and Employment Program ope rehab or whatever prior. And if I don't, I'm thinking of it as gi go related, which means like these things are kind of in the same ballpark, but it may be like a sub program or sub benefit from the GI Bill. I don't know it just seems like it's merged. It's like all together but

Unknown 15:49
yeah I don't even know how did you.

Unknown 15:52
Oh, actually. Actually you're, you're explaining the free well you know that it kind of turns into a big blob of benefits and names and sounds like you're having looking at this, you're at margin sort of gamble. Where are you, what are you doing with this, how is this different from what you know. Yeah. So that's important to capture, so that's good feedback for us to go having gotten this far. If you walk through the next question. Yeah, we'll just take it to the to the end of this one, and then see what you would do next. Okay. So we're going to assume that you are still going to apply for this benefit, or one class to you, you're going to determine your eligibility. So how would you answer the last question. So you've been out for quite some time. So you're outside that that timeline. Yeah. Let's assume, just for the purpose of walking through this, that you're just getting your out your lesson.

Unknown 16:54
And then we'll just continue.

Unknown 16:56
Okay so,

Unknown 16:59
would you like to apply for career planning and guidance benefits now. Share, Like me I'll click yes but again it's, it seems like another. Like I guess it goes with this career planning and guidance.

Unknown 17:21
Sorry my fault. My, my laptop is clearly connected to my phone

Unknown 17:27
works. That is funny. I have to admit, I do the same thing. Like, I could call that for a while. Okay, so you hit the green button and you come to this screen. What do you see going on here. What's your initial impression.

Unknown 17:57
Right yeah man let's begin the process I get that part.

Unknown 18:12
Um, I actually probably prefer this part above here.

Unknown 18:19
Just because it's gonna walk you through the process and then as soon as you read it, then you, you know, go, actually, exactly to this part, or that ox could be on the bottom. It's good to know the steps in the process I mean most cases where you know just.

Unknown 18:34
It's like

Unknown 18:36
a, we're guessing what's coming next I mean it's a lot, a lot better now of course. So seeing something like this at the time, then we know what to expect.

Unknown 18:47
Okay, so it's good like the like the 123, and like having the button have.

Unknown 18:53
Yes, and even this box could be at the bottom.

Unknown 18:58
Just like to finish this. You know this, the steps of the process off. Right. It does seem simple, I mean it's, it seems easy to understand, at least to me. Okay.

Unknown 19:16
So, if you if you decided that you were eligible based on the questions, and you came to this screen right here and you wanted to apply over your next step.

Unknown 19:24
You know I would either you know,

Unknown 19:26
hit the sign in there or sign in to start your application

Unknown 19:30
to do that.

Unknown 19:39
So, in the course of signing into via DACA, you would go through the document and eventually come back to this so it's the same screen, you have to assign. Okay, in what you see right here. And so we went through assignment process. My first question is, would you consider filling out form on authenticated. Why did you choose sign in versus the other option.

Unknown 20:09
Yeah, just because I saw a sign in at the top, that was it.

Unknown 20:13
Oh, that's pretty much it. Okay, so what would you do next haven't covered this file.

Unknown 20:21
This looks like the same information so I'm gonna just click that clicked apply for career counseling,

Unknown 20:26
or at least again,

Unknown 20:29
that's it's just another. So career counseling, it's just it seems like another term that may confuse people

Unknown 20:36
just

Unknown 20:38
another way of saying the same thing. Yeah. Okay. So you click the green button, and you come to this screen right here. What do you want to do next. For the purpose of this. You are an American. So we need yeah we have fake information in place. All right.

Unknown 21:00
Yeah, it's,

Unknown 21:01
yeah. Seems

Unknown 21:03
pretty straightforward. Click Continue. Yes.

Unknown 21:09
And then just confirm the information.

Unknown 21:19
Yep, that's

Unknown 21:19
that. I mean that works outside of me You want me to take this in again. Um, you can. Doesn't matter.

Unknown 21:30
Yeah, so that just felt like I designed several websites, but

Unknown 21:37
the forum's whenever I mean Not that it matters, it probably just my

Unknown 21:41
own personal preference but sure,

Unknown 21:44
I would probably just make two columns there. That's just, again personal preference. It doesn't mean everybody

Unknown 21:50
will like that. and then I confirm it. Click Continue.

Unknown 21:57
All right, let's see it's pretty straightforward, before you click this

Unknown 22:01
I think it hit the back button real quick. It's going to have your input but what are your thoughts about this particular screen right here.

Unknown 22:16
I mean I went through pretty quickly. Yeah, I get it. But, I mean, I am sure most people may see this, if you're already logged in and sign in, then I would think

Unknown 22:30
they would have your statuses that would you think

Unknown 22:32
yeah they would have the status but I you know it also does make sense that you know you could be could be going through this process, and I see I don't even know why would. Why would the spouse of a veteran or servicemember be involved in personalized personalized career planning and guidance, unless they're like the caregiver. But then, there probably wouldn't be applicable, or I mean, again I don't know the benefits or people are entitled to but. Right. And same thing for like the child I mean it's, it would say GI Bill and I would understand it because I know those are, you can transfer them to, you know, your spouse or your kids, and active duty members that make sense because if you're transitioning.

Unknown 23:20
So if you're like the it's a straightforward screen. That's what I'm hearing, and the question was why independent point of view. Okay,

Unknown 23:30
yeah, or the spouse of a veteran, because it's again personalized career planning and guidance, it's just, it's not. It doesn't say GI Bill, so I see it as something. Another benefit. Outside of GI Joe.

Unknown 23:47
All right, well as you proceed from the screen will appear the next one.

Unknown 23:57
Review application.

Unknown 24:03
So is this the whole purpose of this is it to have them.

Unknown 24:09
You submit this information, which it doesn't seem like enough information.

Unknown 24:17
For purposes of prototyping we're only showing that we're all showing the personal info. So the other information in the real working prototype would be there that is the address information, and your staff selection. Yeah, you kind of, you kind of caught us there, we were taking a shortcut on the prototype. So, that populates all the information, your populates a little bit, but the real feature, which at all. So, and in this scenario. If you were to click that off it would show. So with that in mind, what would you do next.

Unknown 24:55
No No,

Unknown 24:56
nobody want to read the privacy policy but, yeah, click the box, you hit submit. I think something useful there and even though you listed the steps of the whole process. A few screens back, you know, listening something on the bottom saying, you know, say for, I don't know the next step of the process so maybe somebody will reach out to you You'll receive correspondence from the VA.

Unknown 25:25
You know, in regards to the next steps

Unknown 25:27
of the process. And

Unknown 25:30
if you came to this screen, would you want, would that prevent you from submitting or would you go ahead and send them.

Unknown 25:38
No I submitted. I mean,

Unknown 25:40
yeah, this wouldn't prevent me

Unknown 25:44
from crossing at all. Okay that's good feedback, we'll go ahead and click that. And so looking at this screen does this. Excuse me, versus going. Does this line up with your expectations, it's, it sounds a little bit like what you were just talking about.

Unknown 26:00
Yeah. Okay.

Unknown 26:04
Yeah, and then it goes.

Unknown 26:07
It just go one step further, see how you can look at the status of your process, and get that.

Unknown 26:20
Yeah, I'm not sure what

Unknown 26:23
this is just to apply for another benefit.

Unknown 26:26
On the bottom Do

Unknown 26:26
you have a service connected disability, or is this the same thing that we just applied for.

Unknown 26:34
Well, to answer your question is, it's chapter 31 whereas, the one we went through was 36, but it's not clear to you from looking at this, that this is something different. That's kind of Yeah.

Unknown 26:46
Okay.

Unknown 26:48
Yeah, and it. I mean, I know that it was a career data, personalized career. Yeah, it's just another term and it does amaze me, and I'm aware I'm accustomed to using this information or like, you know, referencing chapter 31 you know chapter 33 and Voc Rehab or whatever the term is now, but it can get a little confusing there.

Unknown 27:12
Okay, well you were reading along with quite a few other people too. we've talked too, with that. So we have that pretty much top of the list is trying to get the content to align with when you expect it to say try to be consistent. Well we have just like a little bit of time maybe you wouldn't mind staying with this. Looking at this page. If you were somebody with let's say 30% disability rating and you came to the screen we came down to that section.

Unknown 27:42
Would you be inclined to click that link,

Unknown 27:46
which which link

Unknown 27:49
to the section that we rely on this part. Yeah, let's just assume for a second. We've got 3% disability rating.

Unknown 27:58
Yep, on click it. Okay.

Unknown 28:03
And for you just give your thoughts about what you see here. Yeah, having gone through that process and you saw that link, and it brought me here. What's your impression. Now,

Unknown 28:11
again with the terms, or

Unknown 28:19
maybe you should put for 30, odd, those are right here. Can you see that. Yeah, see the list of 30 if you're over 30% service connected, maybe something like that just to clarify, I'm sure it's on here,

Unknown 28:34
the process somewhere but

Unknown 28:37
good to see that here. This is only for eligible veterans that

Unknown 28:41
are rated at 30% or more, or whatever the quote you know

Unknown 28:46
qualifications are for this program.

Unknown 28:49
Well, if you wouldn't mind if you could just like pretend to be a veteran 30% disability rating I don't know what your disability rating is, but just for the person through, could you complete that and see if you would be eligible for that. Yeah.

Unknown 29:05
Okay.

Unknown 29:09
What is kind of better than non normal Nash.

Unknown 29:11
Okay.

Unknown 29:15
There's actually a very good question.

Unknown 29:25
Yeah, this question would be, are you within 12 years of your active duty separation date, or of getting your first VA disability rating. Right. I don't know it's I mean I understand it but I can see people getting confused over the wording for some reason.

Unknown 29:46
But having gone through Do you feel like answering the questions with, you know, just 40% disability rating Do you feel like you're eligible at this point. Having it Yeah,

Unknown 29:55
I keep on moving through the process. Yeah, If I click No, then. Yeah, exactly, that's what I would expect. And maybe I should say something about the 30% rating because we, we often tell people no but you don't tell them why

Unknown 30:16
it's actually a very good insight. I appreciate that. Okay, if you would. If you answered the next question. Yeah.

Unknown 30:27
I should put no since I just retired are separated from a year on the last example. Okay.

Unknown 30:36
So there's a

Unknown 30:37
gap that's again with the wording of like reading a quickly and I'm like right let me read it again.

Unknown 30:43
That's the sort of thing, uncovering this so having come to this last question. Would you go ahead and apply for benefits at this point.

Unknown 30:53
Yep.

Unknown 31:05
All right, yeah it's the same setup. Okay, there's another one. In most most cases people are gonna go straight for this. Okay,

Unknown 31:15
I understand that too. We have watched people do that quite a bit.

Unknown 31:21
All right, and then.

Unknown 31:23
That's what I would do there. All right, everything's populated. Right.

Unknown 31:35
Now if I could stop here for a sec. Yes. Let's say you came and you looked at the screen there was a mistake in there, you know the got your phone number. Wrong. Let's say they put in the wrong place you want to get a cell phone. Yep. What would you do on that screen. And it should be wired you should be able to do anything yeah I would just type it in and then. Okay.

Unknown 32:00
And then same thing you know, unless I had to swap it out here I would put it there. Right. Okay, that's not a simple standard form.

Unknown 32:10
So what would your expectation we want you to hit continue after making that change. What do you think's gonna happen.

Unknown 32:16
Wait, it'll up my expectation will be for that information to be updated everywhere across the VA. But I know personally that is not does not happen. Okay, so, of course, go on to the next step two. Okay, very good.

Unknown 32:40
All right. How many years of education, do you have, I mean I don't even.

Unknown 32:48
It's like after high school. How many yeah I have no idea what that would even. Okay. I mean I have a bachelor's degree so right.

Unknown 33:00
So what if you were to arrive at a number. How would you start counting.

Unknown 33:09
Number. I mean,

Unknown 33:12
let's say 16. Okay, I mean coding high school, I have no idea. Okay,

Unknown 33:18
now that's really good. That's going to be back that's the sort of thing that we need to uncover here so you can increase clear as possible. So you can start with. Basically the kindergarten, that number in Broadway four through four years of college. So that's it. Yes. Okay. That is fine. You didn't really put any number in there I'm interested in finding out where you start accounting, and we'll be able to make that crystal clear to the users when we go to the next days.

Unknown 33:46
Yeah and I mean even, I don't know if the benefit. Oh, I guess it does, it wouldn't be related to that too so. Yep.

Unknown 33:56
Okay. Excuse me.

Unknown 33:59
The next question is, is that a good question for you.

Unknown 34:05
Yeah, it is I would have probably placed this under the dress area.

Unknown 34:11
On a. I think the previous section where

Unknown 34:14
I confirmed all that information. For addresses with addresses. Okay. And then will be your next step be having answered those two questions.

Unknown 34:27
All right, going on next step,

Unknown 34:36
have no idea what that is coming I see what it is there, but is that a

Unknown 34:44
text messaging system.

Unknown 34:48
I wouldn't be, I'm not sure what that is.

Unknown 34:51
Okay. So, if you're if you're not sure what it is would you opt in or out

Unknown 34:56
time. No, I wouldn't. I mean I'm, because I don't know what it is. So I'm thinking something, you know, if this is like a text message reminder type of thing, then, you know, using those terms will probably be easier to understand and

Unknown 35:15
another VA

Unknown 35:18
term. Right.

Unknown 35:22
Okay. And then moving to the next question.

Unknown 35:31
Yeah, with the whole tele counseling I mean that's.

Unknown 35:35
I just put video video chat sessions. I mean I'm guessing that's what it is right, but just video chat and other Wi Fi likes using tele telehealth and stuff but even when I've had a pointment at the VA. They said video conference or video chat, even though it's, I know that the common return is telehealth. But that's not

Unknown 36:03
that's not

Unknown 36:05
to say you, you understand what what it is, despite the change in terms. So you got on this one. Okay.

Unknown 36:12
And then the last question How would you answer that.

Unknown 36:25
I would answer. In most cases, anything with the VA, any available time.

Unknown 36:31
Okay. Wonder clicking them all.

Unknown 36:34
Yeah, why no clicking them all because I know if

Unknown 36:38
if I select only a certain time period,

Unknown 36:43
then it's just going to limit the you know the amount of options that I'll have for, you know, to have a meeting with a counselor, it'll just limit it with them. That's what I think. So I'm like I click them all make myself as available as possible because they're probably taking care of seven people, so

Unknown 37:04
good that is good and so are you. You know both sides of the desk. So that's, that's two times two, right there already, then your next step should

Unknown 37:17
continue.

Unknown 37:24
And it's the same scenario here we don't have everything live in a prototype. So it's just a representative amount of information. You know,

Unknown 37:32
I'm on this top part here. I mean I think the. If there's several steps like four steps in the process. It could listed here like you know this first blue bar whatever that first stage of the process is as soon as you complete it, it turns blue. The next part, you know, step to the process whatever the name is and complete. I know it's a little, a small step but, I mean, I managed my projects like that and all the, all of our teams. Right, little isn't that is, it could see the stage of the process that they're in. And it helps them out.

Unknown 38:11
So right there aren't redesigns, you know with your, your insight is a year with web design and stuff like that you've hit on some of the things that we are working on. There are a lot of initiatives to do different things in the interface. And that's one.

Unknown 38:28
You definitely hit on that. Okay, so what would your next step be now

Unknown 38:32
not read the privacy policy.

Unknown 38:37
No. hit submit.

Unknown 38:40
So what I do with this.

Unknown 38:45
I've called the VA when this the sites have said this information and got got into a rabbit hole, trying to get information that was referenced on here. And not specific Of course to this case but how many men and we throw around this number a lot, and in most cases that I've seen out of five times or 10 times that I've call five times they've been helpful.

Unknown 39:14
Yeah, that's, that's the sort of insight that we do here. Occasionally, you know this and most people are reluctant to to call on. It sounds like your experiences you've gotten through, and it's only 50% helpful. In that case where they're not helpful is, is it kind of kind of threatening what's what typically happens when they're not helpful. Um,

Unknown 39:38
but when they're national full I try to figure out myself. Okay, or actually there's a, the other VA phone number. I have to look it up real quick. it's here, this number the 844-698-2311, which is I think for the contractors who, you know, are the call center
