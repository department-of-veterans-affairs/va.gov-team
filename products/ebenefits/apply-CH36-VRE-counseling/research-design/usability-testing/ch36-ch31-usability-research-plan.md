# Research plan for usability testing for Chapters 31 and 36
**VSA eBenefits Team | September 2020**

`James Adams, designer/researcher`

#### Background
The Chapter 31 program (CH31), Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E), provides counseling and planning to eligible Veterans and service members with **service-connected disabilities** to help them prepare for, obtain, and maintain suitable employment or achieve independence in daily living.

The Chapter 36 (CH36) program, Personalized Career Planning and Guidance (PCPCG), provides career, educational and adjustment counseling to Veterans, service members or **their qualifying dependents.**

The eBenefits team is moving Chapter 31 and Chapter 36 features from the eBenefits site to VA.gov. Primarily, this involves rebuilding the digital versions of VA forms 28-1900 and 28-8832 (CH36). These will be reconstructed on VA.gov using the site's form system conventions. CH31 and CH36 benefits overlap a bit, creating confusion for some users. At VBA's request gating/screening wizards have been developed to help Veterans decide which form is best for them.

### Goals
Our primary goal is to move the Chapter 31 and Chapter 36 features--currently form submissions--to VA.gov, maintaining all existing functionality. Secondarily, we want to reduce confusion between the two programs using screening wizards on the form introduction pages. We're conducting usability testing of the features to determine if the new forms and wizards are intuitive and functional for users needing to submit either form VA 28-1900 or 28-8832.

#### Guiding questions
- Where and how (what links/navigation) do participants expect to find CH31 and CH36 forms?
- Do participants understand the function of the wizard features?
- Will users identify the differences between the CH31 and CH36 programs and select the right form(s)?
- What challenges prevent users from quickly and accurately completing the forms?

#### Hypotheses
- Users will have some difficulty locating the landing pages/logins for the CH31 and CH36 forms on VA.gov
- User will generally understand the function of the screening wizards, but will miss the "bypass" link
- The language in the wizards and intro will confuse users; they may misunderstand when they can apply for both CH36 and CH31 benefits.
- The forms themselves will be very easy for users to complete

### Method
We will engage in moderated usability testing conducted remotely using Zoom. Remote testing is currently the only viable option, but the method should yield acceptable observations on which to base findings. Participants will be recruited using Perigean. These users will be provided links to UXPin prototypes to review the features. The sessions will be recorded, and observers and notetakers may be in attendance.

#### The process
- There will be a quick warm-up and introduction usability testing
- The participant will be given a link to the VA.gov home with instructions to find the CH36 page (Screenshare)
- The user will be provided a link to the CH36 prototype intro screen
- The moderator will outline a scenario (use case) for the participant to follow
- The user will potentially proceed through the wizard, sign-in and the CH36 form itself; or on to the CH31 form
- There will be a quick Q/A and wrap-up

### Participants and recruitment

Recruit for 5 fulfilled sessions using the following criteria:

**Must have for participants**
- No special requirements: can be Veteran, service member or dependent.

**Good to have for participants**

- At least one person with a disability rating of 80% or greater

**Recruitment requirements**
- The participants have Zoom downloaded prior to the session
- The participants know how to screenshare
