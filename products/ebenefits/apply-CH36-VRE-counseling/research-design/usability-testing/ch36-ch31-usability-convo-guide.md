## Intro
Good morning/afternoon and thank you for joining us today. With me are a few colleagues who are helping-out by observing and taking notes. We are part of a team with the Department of Veterans Affairs that is moving some features of the old eBenefits site over to VA.gov. We're learning what veterans need to improve their online experience, and how we can make VA.gov more useful for you. Our focus today is the career and education counseling benefits--most people know them as Chapter 31 and Chapter 36.

There are a few things I need to mention before we start:
- The session should take about 30 minutes. But you can end it at any point--just let me know. We have quite a few things to cover, so to respect your time, I may occasionally break-in to move us to the next item.
- We're not testing **you** in any way--there are no right or wrong answers. We want to hear your thoughts about what we show you so that we can make improvements to VA.gov.
- Please say what's on your mind--good and bad. I will not be offended by any opinions you express.
- Today we'll be working with a prototype of a feature we're developing. Most things we're testing will work, but a lot of what you see isn't functional. But because we're using prototypes, none of your actions will affect your account or any VA information.
- We'd like to record this session. This'll give us a record to use for note-taking. We'll store the recording on a private drive, and it will be deleted when we conclude our testing and note-taking. No personal identifying information will be transcribed.
- I'll ask "on the record" once the recording starts.
- OK, now that I'm recording, do I have your permission to record this session?

## Warm-up
- Would you tell us a little bit about yourself? Your service experience, where you live, general experiences with the VA...
- Have you received VA career counseling or education benefits in the past? What do you know about Chapter 31 or 36?
- (If user has disability rating) Would you mind telling us what your disability rating is?
- How often do you visit the eBenefits site? How about VA.gov?

OK, we'll be doing a couple of things today:
- First, well take a quick look at the VA.gov home page to get an idea of where you might look for the new feature
- Then we'll go to the prototype of the new feature we're testing

## Wayfinding
### User screenshares / 3 minutes
- **Please go to VA.gov.**
- **Now we're ready to start.** OK, now could you share your screen with us?
- If you heard VA could help with finding a job or getting training, where would you look on the site?
- This is the actual home page; you're free to click on anything.

#### Things to look for:
- What is the user's thought process?
- What interactive elements does the user look for (e.g. menu, links, footer...)?
- What content/section does the user expect to have career and education benefits?

## Usability tasks
User goes to prototype
- I have a link in chat to the prototype we're testing; **please click on it.** (Clicks on prototype link to CH36/28-8832 form wizard)
- For the purpose of this test, we'll say you're interested in VA career and education benefits.
- We'll be using made-up scenarios that may not necessarily apply to you. We'll be completing a form (or forms), and you're free to use whatever names and dates come to mind--fake names and numbers are fine.
- Nothing will be submitted because this is a prototype. However, we're recording this, so please don't use real social security numbers--1234567890 should work in those cases.

### Task 1 / Chapter 36 wizard / 5 minutes
User determines if 28-8832 is the sole form to use to apply for career and education benefits
- Please take a **look at this page and see if you qualify for Chapter 36 or other benefits.**
- (When user gets to the time-limit Q) Does this disqualify you? Let's say that it's been only six months.

### Task 1A / Chapter 31 wizard / 5 minutes
Users with a disability rating may jump to the 21-1900
- So do you know why you were sent here?
- How is this different from the previous page/screen/form?
- Please **look at this page and see if you qualify.**
- (When user gets to the time-limit Q) Does this disqualify you? Let's say that it's been only two years.

#### Things to look for:
- Does the user read/understand the intro copy?
- Are the mechanics of the wizard intuitive? What other (wizard) features are users expecting?
- Do any users see or use the "skip to form" link?
- Can the user determine from the wizard if the form is right for them? Will they (and when) jump to the 28-1900?
- Are users thrown-off by the final "do you want to apply" question at the end of wizards?
- Where are users confused by the similarities of the two wizards?

### Task 2 / Completing the form / 3 minutes
User completes the 28-8832 or 28-1900 form
- (If prompt needed) OK, looks like you qualify, so now **take the next step to apply for benefits.**
- (ALT) Seems you don't qualify according to our questions; but what if you were told to complete the form any way? Please **go ahead and apply for benefits.**

### Task 2A / Completing the alternate form / 3 minutes
User jumps to VR&E wizard, then the 28-1900 form
- (If prompt needed) OK, looks like you qualify, so now **take the next step to apply for benefits.**
- (ALT) Seems you don't qualify according to our questions; but what if you were told to complete the form any way? Please **go ahead and apply for benefits.**
- (At end of form) How was this form different from the last form?

#### Things to look for:
- Do users choose to sign in? Or do they prefer to submit the form unauthenticated?
- Is the flow of the form intuitive? What language trips-up the user?
- Do users review their submission info? Do they understand the intended function of the accordions?
- Does the confirmation screen satisfy the user regarding confirmation and next steps?
- Where are users confused by the similarities of the two forms?

## Final thoughts
- If this were an actual application, what would expect to happen next?
- What are your thoughts about the questions at the start of the form?
- What on the site would you do/look at next?
- Do you see differences between Chapter 36 and Chapter 31?
- How could we make things more clear?

## Wrap-up
Looks like we covered everything on my list. (ALT) Looks like we're at (time), so we'll need to leave it here. Is there anything else you'd like us to know--something we didn't cover about the screens we looked at, or VA.gov in general?

## Closing
Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us! Your feedback is critical to our team's effort to improve Veterans' online experiences--and VA.gov in particular. Enjoy the rest of your day!
