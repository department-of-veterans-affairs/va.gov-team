## TED Office Overview
In November 2018, the Office of Transition and Economic Development was created and reports directly to the Principal Deputy Under Secretary for Benefits ([Margarita Devlin, MA, CRC](https://www.benefits.va.gov/benefits/bio_margarita_devlin.asp)) and collaborates across all VBA business lines and work towards empowering current and future Veterans.  In addition to Chapter 36, TED also works on the Transition Assistance Program (TAP) and is on over 300 military installations and impacts over 200,000 transitioning servicemembers nationwide.

Currently, Chapter 36 is housed within VRE but on October 1, 2020 it will re-align with the TED Office.  Renamed from Personalized Career Planning and Guidance (PCPG) Program with assistance from Mitre.

There are a few differentiators for how Chapter 36 will be administered: 1) Using contracted counselors, 2) The application process will be triaged by TED as they come in online, working with VRE, who owns the Form 8832.

This program will be accessible by Veterans and their dependents.

### Q&A
**What happens after an application is processed?  What is the next thing a Veteran might hear?**  
When someone applies, the first thing is that eligibility is determined, then it goes to a contract counselor to have that service done and a report is generated.

Right now, online at EBN, a notification gets sent to someone at a VRE mailbox (based on the address) so they can pull it up and assess the eligibility and further processing/contact.  

**If someone hands in a paper form directly to someone at a regional office, is there a processing lag time?**   
If they do it right there in person, there is no lag time if any and it wouldn't even be digitized.

**Part of the application talks about how the applicant would like to be contacted, is there a sense as to how long getting back to them might take?**  
Currently, we reach out by telephone, email, and then letter where we reference the previous attempt at communication. 

**What is the time frame from: date of receipt, reviewing eligibility, to initial contact with applicant?**  
Five (business days).  

**Do you have a sense of volume?  How many applications are obtained?**  
Data is unreliable but we think it might be 4-6,000 per year but that is based on very little evidence.

**Is there a blueprint for what is absolutely required via the form or a minimum amount of things to get someone through the process?**   
As an action item, we would like to spend some time on that and we will get back to you in about a week.

Future steps will include comm strategy which the EBN team can help collaborate with and there is a contractor (DIS) in place to help with this and any other marketing needs.  There will most likely be some announcement in September.

Lois has shared some SME and customer findings via email (April 1, 2020).

### Notes from Education and Career Counseling discovery deck
The discovery deck outlined the results of the implementation of a Human Centered Design (HCD) strategy. Organizers gathered information and insights around Chapter 36 by talking to Veterans and service members, private sector counselors, and program intermediaries. Organizers mapped out the user journeys of participants, and identified strengths and weaknesses, pain points and opportunities.

#### Key takeaways for VA.gov implementation of 28-8832 (Application for Educational and Career Counseling)

- Dependents of Veterans and service members are eligible for ECC, but they are underserved; often, they don't realize they are eligible, and the strong focus is on Veterans and service member themselves.
- Websites, and other sources, presents incomplete or misleading information; participants often just "stumbled" onto Chapter 36 info searching a variety of VA sites.
- eBenefits in particular was cited for hidden, mischaracterized information.
- Because of nomenclature and program overlaps, VA education and career programs are conflated and confused; participants often mixed-up the features and benefits of Chapter 33, Chapter 31 and Chapter 36. Confusion is stronger between CH 36 and CH31.
- There was a marked decrease in CH36 applications when the "paperless" electronic application process was encouraged.
- One specific recommendation was to give Chapter 36 benefits its own page, and to cross-promote CH36 on Chapter 33 pages.
- There is a general recommendation to produce clear, easily understood content for CH36 pages.
- Another particular recommendation was to host Chapter 36 events for groups of eligible participants which would include completing the 28-8832 on eBenefits.
- The deck gives anecdotes from individual who process CH36 forms; they say form information is incomplete and processing time is often greater than two weeks.
- There is a correlation between processing time and participation: the less time in processing, the higher the rate of program participation.
