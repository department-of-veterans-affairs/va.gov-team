**Dependency verification usability testing conversation guide**

- (Start recording) OK now, do I have your permission to record this session? Yes you do. 

**Warm-up**

- Please tell me a little about yourself: My name is Neil; I did 30 years in the army. I got injury and was hospitalized for a while. It was a broken back, I finished 30 years then went to work for the federal government then retired. 
- Dependents: no. 
- How often do you visit the eBenefits site? I did once but I think I get all of the benefits I will get. The hearing aids are expensive enough, that’s a good benefit. Another thing is that I had gotten my covid test but they offered it for your spouse as well, I thought that was neat. I have seen a lot of change in the va, they are more proactive now. They put out the health watch magazine and it’s the first time I saw that kind of thing come from there, they have some good things in there. 
- about VA.gov? Yes, I get a lot of emails from them at the VA clinic for Fort Meade. I go through va.gov to talk to them as well. I get physicals there; I get my prescriptions form the army hospital. Then I get my hearing aids and evaluations through them. 

**Scenario 1: Verify dependents**

For the first task, imagine that you have two dependents -- a spouse and one child. You're on VA.gov to get some info about dependents benefits.

What are you looking at: the second one, how to add a dependent than more questions about adding or removing. I would check 1,2,3,4 which I will probably do now after this meeting. Just looking what else we have here. This looks interesting, I had never seen this before. If I had questions on this, I would think when I die my benefits would pass on to her or how would that work.

**Task 1 / Sign-in / 5 minutes**

- You're now on VA.gov and you want to know who the VA has listed as your dependents. Find your list of dependents: oh that’s cool. Back before you had something to click on that had who can be my dependents. When we talk about this I am not sure, the va will pay disabilities for dependents. There are a lot of questions in here I could explore to find out exactly how to add dependents
- Thinking: it has a lot of good stuff to think about. If I really needed something for va to assist with I would get good answers or try to call or visit someone.  You have all of the applications here as well. What question I would have is what does a dependent need, do they need an injury. I am asking because my wife has a bad foot and she has issues walking and she won’t do anything because she says she’s fine. 
- If you thought there was a list how to view: Yeah how to add or view current dependents. Interesting stuff, can I save this online so I can go over these myself. 

**Task 2 / Review dependents / 5 minutes**

- .
- Why do you think you're seeing this? Its not my kid. 
- What is it asking: to verify if it is correct or change dependent. If it were mine I would verify or if they are 18 have them taken off. 

**Task 3 / Confirm dependents / 2 minutes**

For this scenario, your dependents should be Veronica Corningston and Quanily Ortiz.

- What other information would you need to confirm these are your dependents or not? That’s enough. 
- If the list of dependents is correct, what would you do next? Go ahead and do that: click verify this is correct. 

And now you've come to this page. What do you see here? Somewhere in the vast computer world of va, next to my name it has the dependents under mine and verifying they are still my dependents. What they do with it who knows. 

To change: click change and this tells you how to remove a dependent. That’s pretty detailed, it’s almost like getting a passport. 

**Scenario 2: Update dependents**

Let's go on to the next scenario. This time, you are going to be Allan and you have one child, Margie. Margie has recently finished school and you want to remove her from your benefits.

**Task 1A / Back to start / 2 minutes**

User is again given the link to the starting page in the VA.gov staging environment and credentials for test user 15.

- You are back on VA.gov. Remove Carl from your list of dependents: click add or remove a dependent here, (reading page) remove child that is 18 to 23. This is self-explanatory. Whoever made this its good. 

**Task 2A / Review dependents / 2 minutes**

- Why do you think you're seeing this now?
- How often do expect to see this? 
- After user clicks “Remove dependent” link: This is where we run into a feature we haven’t prototyped yet. What would you expect to happen now? Eventually when they got around to it they would remove it. 
- What do you think actually happens: I was being facetious because when you work on the internet with government agencies nothing happens overnight. It might take a week, 3 months, or a year especially when the va started and I went in for an emulation it says it might take 6 months to a year. 
- How to confirm: a month later I would go in to check if they were removed. If I saw that they were not removed I would probably start the process all over again. Then a month later if they aren’t removed I would call
- Why important to remove dependents: because know how the government works, if you don’t keep on top of these they will tell you that you didn’t do this and you’d lose your benefits and take no responsibility. Less you are proactive you get lost in places. It would be good to get a confirmation and then confirm
- Expect to get one: 50/50 it would be nice if you did so you could file it away. 
- How often to eb asked: if you go to va once a year for a checkup they should have a questionnaire to confirm the appointment and asking if anything has changed. Or even when you get an appointment once a year, there should be somewhere that asks if anything has changed. 
- What information: it says that I am alive, kids are still alive and the medical conditions have not changed. 
- Sent a form to va: Not that I know of. It might have but I don’t know. I would hope that when you send something like this a questionnaire is being automatically developed so when the VA receives it all of the information would create a form
- This page that you’re on: yes. The application must go someplace. 
- Verify dependent form: it should have. I think this whole thing. Looking at this and its talking about the application, I think that would be a form. It wouldn’t go in a blackhole someplace. 

**Final thoughts**

- How could we make things clearer? No, just looking at it I think you have covered a lot of ground on this kind of thing. Only think I would say where it says need help, as long as someone answers the phone. I think it has a lot of good information.

**Wrap-up**

Looks like we covered everything on my list. (ALT) Looks like we're at (time), so we'll need to leave it here. Is there anything else you'd like us to know--something we didn't cover about the screens we looked at, or VA.gov in general?

**Closing**

Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us! Your feedback is critical to our team's effort to improve Veterans' online experiences--and VA.gov in particular. Enjoy the rest of your day!
