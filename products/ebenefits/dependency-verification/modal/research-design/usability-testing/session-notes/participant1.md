**Dependency verification usability testing conversation guide**

- (Start recording) OK now, do I have your permission to record this session? Yes. 

**Warm-up**

- Please tell me a little about yourself: Well lets see now. I live in CA; I work as a legal document assistant. I work 1 day at the office then 4 days at home, I’m married, two kids and that’s it. 
- Benefits: yes. 
- Have you used eBenefits to make changes to your dependents? No. 
  - What kind of changes did you make?
- How often do you visit the eBenefits site? Yes I do. I mostly order medicine, setup appointments and I can talk to serval people in my group including the doctors, nurse people of that nature. I can go on and check test results. 
- How about VA.gov? Yes I do. I just look to see if my benefits have changed, I have people working on my behalf and you never know when they will change it or not. recently I looked on it to make sure I have dependent benefits and things of that nature that have been approved. 

**Scenario 1: Verify dependents**

For the first task, imagine that you have two dependents -- a spouse and one child. You're on VA.gov to get some info about dependents benefits.

**Task 1 / Sign-in / 5 minutes**

- Now I have put a link to the page we're starting on in the chat; **please click on it.** (Clicks on link to landing page)
- To be able to see dependents' information, you'll have to log in. I put the username and password in the chat -- **use these to sign-in.** For this scenario, your name is Morris.
- You're now on VA.gov and you want to know who the VA has listed as your dependents. **Find your list of dependents:** I am at the beginning, do I have to sign in. Okay, sign in, okay continue to va.gov. I am back on the page to view or add dependents. Do I click on how to add a dependent. Oh how to view  current dependents. Okay it is showing me with a screen (reading page) verify they are correct. 

**Task 2 / Review dependents / 5 minutes**

Modal intercepts user.

- observe reaction If needed, prompt: Tell me what you are thinking here.
- Why do you think you're seeing this? Because this is what is available to the va at this present time. 
- Who is listed as your dependents? yes a spouse and a child.

**Task 3 / Confirm dependents / 2 minutes**

For this scenario, your dependents should be Veronica Corningston and Quanily Ortiz.

- observe reaction If needed, prompt: Tell me what you are thinking here.
- What other information would you need to confirm these are your dependents or not? Well it is showing me the spouse, child, last 4 of the SSN and the Dob. So I would know this is correct. 
- If the list of dependents is correct, what would you do next? Go ahead and do that. I would keep going to see what it offers me. it is showing me different relationships and then the test. It says thank you for verifying the dependents. I can get more information to the right
- Do you need more: yes, it tells me to let the va know if there is a change (reading list)

**Scenario 2: Update dependents**

Let's go on to the next scenario. This time, you are going to be Allan and you have one child, Margie. Margie has recently finished school and you want to remove her from your benefits.

**Task 1A / Back to start / 2 minutes**

- You are back on VA.gov. Remove Margie from your list of dependents.: okay so I need to sign in with id.me. okay go to add or remove dependents. 
- Can you go back a page for me, how to see if he is on the list first: I thought it would have the list of my dependents. Okay going to the top, view current dependents. Click view current dependents. It is should child, verify that is correct. Are we looking for mike, oh theres carl. Change dependents. I see the list again. I don’t see how to delete it. theres a click learn more for adding or removing, if I saw this I would click add or remove. 

**Task 2A / Review dependents / 2 minutes**

- After user clicks “Remove dependent” link: This is where we run into a feature we haven’t prototyped yet. What would you expect to happen now? That the child would be taken off the list of benefits. 

**Final thoughts**

- If this were an actual application, what would expect to happen next? I would go back to the list of dependents and it would show me if they were there or not. 
- Immediate or take time: well in the old days it would take time but now it should be immediate. 
- Important to verify: computers have problems and sometimes you need to check to make sure the transaction that was done was successful because you may or may not get a confirmation email so it is important o make sure it was taken care of. 
- Why to verify: the va might want me to do that because perhaps it could result in an over payment. 
- How often should they ask: it should be every year on their birthday and maybe an email to have me to check it and this is where I would go to check and make sure carl is no longer on my list. I can take care of it there, no overpayments and everyone is happy. 
- What on the site would you do/look at next?
- Did you notice any differences between the “Verify” and “Update” screens?
- How could we make things clearer? Well I didn’t really run into any problems; I was able to see the list of dependents and I imagine when this computer program is really set I should be able to move around and it will be cleaner and easier. A lot of veterans would be frustrated if they have to click a lot, this is a lot smoother.
