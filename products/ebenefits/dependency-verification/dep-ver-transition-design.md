## Feature background
Veterans need to stay current with VA regarding the status of their dependents. Currnetly, Veterans are asked to update their dependents by mailed paper letter only every 8 years. This creates a very large time-gap and can directly lead to Vetereans being overpaid on their disability claims as dependents lose their status. As "overpayments" contiunue (potentially for years), Veterans incur an increasing debt to VA.

To short-circuit this cycle VA proposed intercepting Veterans when they log into VA.gov, and presenting a reminder to chack and updat their dependents status. The initial concept presented was a sitewide modal.

- [Proposed intercept page on VA.gov](https://www.va.gov/view-change-dependents/view)
- [VA Form 26-1880](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-686c/)
