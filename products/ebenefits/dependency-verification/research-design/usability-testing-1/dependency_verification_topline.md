This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.


**The goal of this document is:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Initial Findings


**Finding #1**
- Participants accepted the modal as part of the workflow and understood the options were to say that their list of participants was correct.


**Finding #2**
- If users have not logged into the site (tested on staging.va.gov) before and go directly to the /view page, the va.gov SSO modal over the dependency verification modal where the mouse interacts with the dependency verification modal in the background. User must dismiss the DV modal before they can continue or dismiss the SSO modal.

**Finding #3**
- Participants thought the name and relationship was sufficent information to verify dependents on the modal during the task, but when they reached the full /view page, they liked seeing birthdate and last 4 of the SSN.


**Finding #4**
- After clicking “make changes” on the modal, participants expected the list of participants shown to have an option to remove a dependent in line rather than linking through to another “Add or Remove Dependent” screen.


**Finding #5**
- Users did not see the confirmation and alert boxes. This seems to be a combination of auto scrolling to a particular header and viewport size.


**Finding #6**
- All participants were able to link to the Add or Remove Dependents page, but were overwhelmed by the subway map. They noted the overall text was too much, but there was no information on removing a dependent. One also noted that the time to complete was too much just to remove someone.

**Finding #7**
- Participants expected that they could go back to their list of dependents to see that a dependent had been removed. Most expected that this would be immediate, but some would take additional steps such as logging out and back in to verify the change “took”. A couple also expected to get a letter in the mail because “letters are how VA communicates”.
