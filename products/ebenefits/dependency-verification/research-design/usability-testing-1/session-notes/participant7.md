**Dependency verification usability testing conversation guide**

- (Start recording) OK now, do I have your permission to record this session? Yes

**Warm-up**

- Please tell me a little about yourself:  I was in the service in the navy in 1975 and retired in 2001. I put in over 26 years. I was stations mostly on navy ships and submarines. I liked the navy but nowadays I am having issues with my physical alignments I got in the service. I am able to battle and survive every day. 
- Dependents: yes my wife. 
- Have you used eBenefits to make changes to your dependents? A long time ago when I had my daughter as a dependent when she was going to school. There was times within the date of birth and not going to school anymore. 
- How often do you visit the eBenefits site? Yes, I used it a lot when applying for my disability claim. That took almost 16 years working with it. I don’t even remember if when I retired there was an ebenefits but I used it a lot during 2001 to today. The only time I use va.gov was when they were transition over to the new site. I use it a lot for my claims and medical appointments, prescriptions, and when I am providing information to my provider. 
- How about VA.gov? Yes, most recently in the last 2-3 years.

**Scenario 1: Verify dependents**

For the first task, imagine that you have two dependents -- a spouse and one child. You're on VA.gov to get some info about dependents benefits.

**Task 1 / Sign-in / 5 minutes**

- You're now on VA.gov and you want to know who the VA has listed as your dependents. Find your list of dependents: I would click how to view current dependents; it says sign in for current dependents.  Normally sign in with the ds login. That may work, its just taking a little longer this morning. Now I have this screen, click on view current dependents. 

**Task 2 / Review dependents / 5 minutes**

- Tell me what you are thinking here: It says the minor child and spouse and to verify if it is correct. 
- Why do you think you're seeing this? it is giving me the most current infomration that the va has on file for my account.
- Who is listed as your dependents? A minor child and spouse. 

**Task 3 / Confirm dependents / 2 minutes**

For this scenario, your dependents should be Veronica Corningston and Quanily Ortiz.

- If needed, prompt: Tell me what you are thinking here.: it is giving me the most current infomration that the va has on file for my account. 
- What other information would you need to confirm these are your dependents or not? I think if there was a date of birth for my dependents because that is the criteria for how long they will be the dependents. If they are in school full time. I think if I remember right when my daughter was going to school, she was included until she finished her degree. In some cases if the dependent is older, I don’t even remember then age then the va would normally remove them as a dependent since they are past the maximum age. 
- Va does automatically: normally you get a letter from the va telling you that they are taking them off since they are beyond the age. 
- If the list of dependents is correct, what would you do next? Go ahead and do that: its saying thing thank you for verifying the dependents.
- Options on the screen: that is the screen I was looking for that would be good to have their DOB and SSN. I would agree to that. Yeah. 
- Infomration that would be useful to you: its complete, it still has the link to learn more about adding or removing dependents from the va benefits. If you enter for the first time you’d click the link to learn more. Once you’ve done the verification then this screen should satisfy whatever information I would need. Yeah it even says thank you for verifying and that twill make a note that it is update and correct. (reading screen). This is good

Expect now: after doing the verification I think the next screen would be to have a screen that says submit or validation complete. Something on that action is what I would be looking for. The continuing action. When I look at this I am really looking for the next screen to say validation complete. Let me read the right side. Okay find out more of dependent benefits. Okay yeah good everything is there , theres even a phone number to call if there are questions. 

**Scenario 2: Update dependents**

Let's go on to the next scenario. This time, you are going to be Allan and you have one child, Carl. Carl has recently finished school and you want to remove her from your benefits.

**Task 1A / Back to start / 2 minutes**

- You are back on VA.gov. Remove Carl from your list of dependents: I would click on add or remove dependents. Let me click on that. Very good action because if you don’t remove it you will end up getting overpaid. (reading page). 

**Task 2A / Review dependents / 2 minutes**

- Why do you think you're seeing this now? It says your va dependent, click on add or remove. I would normally validate first. Lets say carl scmidt who was born in 2010 is no longer a dependent. There we go, dependents no on your, theres two that are little would be deleted, its not on the benefits anyways. 
- If carl aged out, how to remove: in this case since I don’t see how to highlight or how to select it I would normally learn more about adding or removing a dependent or click on this add or remove button. 
- What is it asking: (reading page) I think it is asking you to validate the request, I would click continue the application. I like that screen, step one gives you options on reasons why you are adding or removing a dependent and covers everyone else, the spouse and child. They died, left the house, aged out, not attending school. This is good, I think this is complete.  
- How often do expect to see this?
- After user clicks “Remove dependent” link: This is where we run into a feature we haven’t prototyped yet. What would you expect to happen now? What I would expect would to have the next screen to validate the request I have. That’s what I would look for on the next screen. 
- Infomration you would see: I would be looking for an effective date and of course you would have already selected the reason. The va system would be how much decrease in pay you’d be getting. Would it be a minus 100 per month because you have less dependents. I would be looking for that. 
- Where to find that: Normally you would get a letter from the va and it would be nice if it was on the payment screen to indicate the decrease in benefits you are getting. 

**Final thoughts**

- If this were an actual application, what would expect to happen next?
- What on the site would you do/look at next?
- Did you notice any differences between the “Verify” and “Update” screens?
- How could we make things clearer? No, I think the continue updating website really helps everyone. Especially the older veterans like me.

**Wrap-up**

Looks like we covered everything on my list. (ALT) Looks like we're at (time), so we'll need to leave it here. Is there anything else you'd like us to know--something we didn't cover about the screens we looked at, or VA.gov in general?

**Closing**

Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us! Your feedback is critical to our team's effort to improve Veterans' online experiences--and VA.gov in particular. Enjoy the rest of your day!
