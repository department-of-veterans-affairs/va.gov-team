**Dependency verification usability testing conversation guide**

- (Start recording) OK now, do I have your permission to record this session? Yes. 

**Warm-up**

- Please tell me a little about yourself: I am retired air force. I did 21 years and then I worked for the federal government for about 19 years and retired from them 5 years ago. My last job in the government was with the va in the benefits office. I did acquisitions. 
- Dependents: Yes, a long time ago. 
- Have you used eBenefits to make changes to your dependents?  Yeah, I had to remove my dependent. My son is disabled and he’s 40. I claimed him when he was 18 because he was in college because of his disability wasn’t diagnosed at a certain time I wasn’t allowed to continue to claim him. He had to be diagnosed prior to his 18th birthday. 
- How often do you visit the eBenefits site? Yes.
- How about VA.gov? I just saw you can login through there to get into everything. I keep forgetting so I got to my HealtheVet and ebenefits. 
- Ebenefits: sometimes I look for documents, like if I cant find my disability letter so I go in and print that. I actually filed a claim recently and check the claim through ebenefits for the status. Mostly to find documents that I cant find a copy so I go and print it. 

**Scenario 1: Verify dependents**

For the first task, imagine that you have two dependents -- a spouse and one child. You're on VA.gov to get some info about dependents benefits.

**Task 1 / Sign-in / 5 minutes**

User is given a link to a starting page in the VA.gov staging environment and log in info for test user 108.

- You're now on VA.gov and you want to know who the VA has listed as your dependents. **Find your list of dependents:** I would scroll down and click on how to view current dependents. I would click on all of them to read it.** It is allowing me to open up the links. I would go here then I shouldn’t have anyone. 

**Task 2 / Review dependents / 5 minutes**

Modal intercepts user.

- Who is listed as your dependents? Veronica Corningston and Quanily Ortiz, the  there are some under not on benefits(read list)

**Task 3 / Confirm dependents / 2 minutes**

For this scenario, your dependents should be Veronica Corningston and Quanily Ortiz.

- Tell me what you are thinking here: It was letting me know is a dependent and verifying who are dependents for me. 

**Scenario 2: Update dependents**

Let's go on to the next scenario. This time, you are going to be Allan and you have one child, Margie. Margie has recently finished school and you want to remove her from your benefits.

**Task 1A / Back to start / 2 minutes**

- You are back on VA.gov. Remove Carl from your list of dependents:  If you are claiming child that became disabled prior to 18, it was 21 when he became permanently disabled, that’s why I cant claim him. I would go here. Right here view current dependents. 

My son is 100 percetn disabled, I am not sure if I could claim him since he gets his own benefits. This is a good question that I will be logging in later to see if I can find the answer to that. 

**Task 2A / Review dependents / 2 minutes**

- Why do you think you're seeing this now? It is telling me who I have as a dependent.
- What to do if I remove: I would click change dependents.  
- What else to verify they are correct dependents: I guess I would just click verify this is correct. 
- To remove: change dependents. Theres that screen doing that again, oh I would add or remove the dependent. Then click add or remove. I don’t know why it isnt scrolling down. 

**Final thoughts**

- If this were an actual application, what would expect to happen next? Its telling you if you got married to add spouse, divorce to remove the spouse. 
- After answering it: it would make a change and I would get a message stating that I removed a spouse or whatever. 
- What on the site would you do/look at next? I would go back to view the dependents then I would if what I did it should be there or removed already. Then I would verify it is correct. 
- Did you notice any differences between the “Verify” and “Update” screens?
- Information they received: that I added or removed a dependent. 
- Form from you: they would have gotten something. I would double check it actually happened because sometimes they don’t change it and you still get the money. I would make sure the funds actually stopped. Right because you could end up 5 years later getting a massive bill. 
- How often to verify: Um, maybe yearly. I didn’t notice it was here. This is really good information. 
- How could we make things clearer? Um, I am not sure if it has been done but maybe the VA news that they put out make sure that theres something n there letting them know you can do this. I consider myself pretty savvy with the va page but those that aren’t may not know and you call the 800 number. This way you can do it online instead of calling. I get the newsletter so I know what’s happening. I don’t know who reads it again that depends on who uses the web. I like to do it all online. Younger people more so than the older people.

**Wrap-up**

Looks like we covered everything on my list. (ALT) Looks like we're at (time), so we'll need to leave it here. Is there anything else you'd like us to know--something we didn't cover about the screens we looked at, or VA.gov in general?

**Closing**

Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us! Your feedback is critical to our team's effort to improve Veterans' online experiences--and VA.gov in particular. Enjoy the rest of your day!
