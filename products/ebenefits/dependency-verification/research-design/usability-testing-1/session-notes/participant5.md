**Dependency verification usability testing conversation guide**

- (Start recording) OK now, do I have your permission to record this session? Yes

**Warm-up**

- Please tell me a little about yourself: My name is Chris, I served in the Marine Corps for 30 years. 
- Dependents: I do have dependents and I guess I receive benefits for them, yes. 
- Have you used eBenefits to make changes to your dependents? I did, the last time was when my youngest son was in college. 
- How often do you visit the eBenefits site? How about VA.gov? on and off just to look at the information and after I get an email about a new program or benefits. I think the covid 19 shot to see what the va was doing to promote veterans for getting the shot. 

**Scenario 1: Verify dependents**

For the first task, imagine that you have two dependents -- a spouse and one child. You're on VA.gov to get some info about dependents benefits.

**Task 1 / Sign-in / 5 minutes**

User is given a link to a starting page in the VA.gov staging environment and log in info for test user 108.

- You're now on VA.gov and you want to know who the VA has listed as your dependents. Find your list of dependents: I think here it says how to view current dependents so I would click on that link to see what came up. Then you have to sign in. I don’t think anything changed. I don’t see the list of my dependents. It says view current dependents so I would click that to see what it does. 

**Task 2 / Review dependents / 5 minutes**

- Tell me what you are thinking here: it lists my dependents. I assume they are correct. It shows me I have two dependents in the system. My spouse and a minor child. As long as the names are correct, that would be confirmation for me.
- Why do you think you're seeing this?  I hit the button to view the dependents, I was expecting to see it. I also see in the shadow behind isnt the same. I don’t know what’s going on  but okay. . I see the ones behind that aren’t the same. As long as I hit the screen and the names are correct, I would be pretty happy. 

**Task 3 / Confirm dependents / 2 minutes**

For this scenario, your dependents should be Veronica Corningston and Quanily Ortiz.

- Tell me what you are thinking here.
- What other information would you need to confirm these are your dependents or not?
- If the list of dependents is correct, what would you do next? And now you've come to this page. What do you see here? click the verify it is correct. If I got to this and saw the last four and the birthdays. If everything was correct I would go on with whatever I planned on doing on the site. 

**Scenario 2: Update dependents**

**Task 1A / Back to start / 2 minutes**

- You are back on VA.gov. Remove Carl from your list of dependents: I would have to sign in. so view current dependents, I would click that. I have a wife and six children. Theres two I guess I would need to know who’s the oldest. 
- To remove: click change dependents button. 
- Excepting to happen: I guess, I thought there would be a list of dependents and there would be a check mark next to the dependent I would change. It went back to basically everything. It says you can add or remove from this page and theres a button so I guess I am doing the same thing twice or it feels like I am
- At this point: click add or remove dependent. 
- What is happening: I expected to just put a x in the button but now I have to read all of these steps. Wow. So far I don’t think anything has been applied. I don’t think any of these. (reading page) Oh wow. 
- Infomration that is useful: No. 
- What to do here: I would go all the way down and hit add or remove. 30 minutes seems to be a long time to say my child is out of college and no longer eligible. 
- Asks what you want to do: Wow. 

**Task 2A / Review dependents / 2 minutes**

- Why do you think you're seeing this now? VA is trying to narrow down the purpose for my action. I finally got to why I am doing it but haven’t been able to identify who yet. after clicking it 3 times I’m asking what is happening. I would think it would be easy because they aged out but it isnt. I would click remove. I would click remove then remove. This seems like a lot of clicks. It should eb 1 click, identify who and provide a reason and be done with it. 
- How often do expect to see this? I suppose to be proactive it would be when they approach at 18 when they would be removed unless they were attending school. I think VA sent me a letter to verify my child was attending school and I had to submit the form. 
- Expect that type of notification or online: I would almost except to see it online and in the mail. With whatever correspondence that I can do it on the website which is the preferred way to do it.
- Why: it is easier for va and it may or may not be easier for the veteran. It would be easier for me. I hope this isnt the system because having to click 3times and still haven’t gotten to the names. It needs to be quicker than this many buttons and pages. 
- After user clicks “Remove dependent” link: This is where we run into a feature we haven’t prototyped yet. What would you expect to happen now? At some point I would like to have a box that pops up and I would like to see a box that has you confirm that you removed it. after you confirm then be done with it.
- Where to see if they were removed: I would need to go through the process to remove it. If I wanted to see if the system had updated
- Va received a form from you: No because going on the internet to do it so I don’t need to fill out a form to send to the va. 
- Why is it important to verify: compensation is based on the number of dependents or having dependents. Or underpaid because you haven’t added them. 

**Final thoughts**

- How could we make things clearer? No, the biggest recommendation is to get to what you want to as quick as possible and not the same questions over and over. You don’t need to ask me three times.

**Wrap-up**

Looks like we covered everything on my list. (ALT) Looks like we're at (time), so we'll need to leave it here. Is there anything else you'd like us to know--something we didn't cover about the screens we looked at, or VA.gov in general?

**Closing**

Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us! Your feedback is critical to our team's effort to improve Veterans' online experiences--and VA.gov in particular. Enjoy the rest of your day!
