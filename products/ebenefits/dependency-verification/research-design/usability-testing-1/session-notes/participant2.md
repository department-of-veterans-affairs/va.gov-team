**Dependency verification usability testing conversation guide**

- (Start recording) OK now, do I have your permission to record this session? Yes, go right ahead. 

**Warm-up**

- Please tell me a little about yourself: Well I am 69, retired Airforce Lt Colonel. I was an operator flying airplanes, C4, graduated in Ohio and then went to college in northeastern Ohio. I spent 27 years in the Airforce and retired since 01. That’s about it. 
- Have you used eBenefits to make changes to your dependents? No, well I get the 30 dollars for my wife I get that but she does not get benefits.
  - What kind of changes did you make?
- How often do you visit the eBenefits site? I have been on there over a year to see what all I was eligible for; I have not sued it to make appointments or claim anything
- How about VA.gov? I have been there. Other than to see the doctor a few years ago to get my percentages upgraded. I haven’t been there in a long time. I live in FL and I can just drive to the va and ask questions and I enjoy the computer but if I can talk to someone I will go talk to them. 

**Scenario 1: Verify dependents**

For the first task, imagine that you have two dependents -- a spouse and one child. You're on VA.gov to get some info about dependents benefits.

**Task 1 / Sign-in / 5 minutes**

- You're now on VA.gov and you want to know who the VA has listed as your dependents. **Find your list of dependents:** (reading page) okay so it goes up to the top, I would need to make an account. View current dependents and it is a funny account so there is a spouse and child. And its asking you to verify. 

**Task 2 / Review dependents / 5 minutes**

Modal intercepts user.

- observe reaction If needed, prompt: Tell me what you are thinking here.
- Why do you think you're seeing this? To verify you have the right people, it makes sense. 
- Who is listed as your dependents? Spouse and child. 

**Task 3 / Confirm dependents / 2 minutes**

For this scenario, your dependents should be Veronica Corningston and Quanily Ortiz.

- observe reaction If needed, prompt: Tell me what you are thinking here.
- What other information would you need to confirm these are your dependents or not? they are verified and then we move on. It was successful with little to no pain. Only in the fact if you have the common last name you might want to put address or location. If it is smith or jones you might want to put the address so you know you have the right one. On the next page it ahs the last 4 ssn, that might be good on verifying it is the right person. 

**Scenario 2: Update dependents**

Let's go on to the next scenario. This time, you are going to be Allan and you have one child, Margie. Margie has recently finished school and you want to remove her from your benefits.

**Task 1A / Back to start / 2 minutes**

- You are back on VA.gov. Remove Carl from your list of dependents:  we have already viewed current dependents; I need to view dependents. After that theres an add or remove box, then I will remove carl that was born 1-29-12. Click add or remove him, it says follow steps below and ahs the check list below. 

**Task 2A / Review dependents / 2 minutes**

Modal intercepts user.

- observe reaction
- Why do you think you're seeing this now?
- How often do expect to see this? When their birthday or date that they are ineligible should trigger a verification. Maybe yearly when I get the letter. 
- After user clicks “Remove dependent” link: This is where we run into a feature we haven’t prototyped yet. What would you expect to happen now? (reading page) Having SSN is probably to add. You will need the infomration about that person, that should eb general knowledge.  It doesn’t say anything about how to remove a dependent other than the date of the event that they are ineligible that would normally be their birthday. 
- How to verify it: I suspect I would normally do it is sign out then back in and check to see if they are on the list. Here at the bottom they will send a letter once it ahs been processed so I would wait for the letter. It is at the bottom since you have read through everything it proved the box to add or remove. It gives the estimated time which is 30 minutes but I don’t think it would be that long. Since you are asking me to remove the dependent and this says to add or remove, nowhere in the highlighted area it doesn’t tell you how to remove it is in the sub subheading. I would think if you’re talking about hoe to remove it should eb removed, I think it should me bolded as well because it took me 3 times reading it. 
- Click link, what would you do to remove here: to remove someone from this page, it says remove or add is the title. I am not sure, just from me looking at this, I am finding it hard to find where it says add or remove. 
- Pretend sign in says add or remove: I have a wife and two kids
- To remove Alan: I would click change dependents. Is this an edit box, I cant tell. That should give you an edit key like on the right hand side a pencil to update and a trash can to delete. You might need to edit a birthday or just remove. 
- Why is it important: if I am getting benefits for spouse then for kids if they were getting healthcare up until 26th it would be important to have them there. I am not familiar  enough to know. I guess if it was the Gi bill transferred to a child you would need to now they had the right infomration for that. Theres a lot of information to make sure it is correct
- Time to remove, why: to remove them so they don’t get a benefit that they aren’t entitled to so the government goes and tells them they aren’t entitled and they owe 5K back.
