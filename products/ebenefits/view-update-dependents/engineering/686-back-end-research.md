## Current Process Flow
When a user creates a new 686 form, the system makes an MVI call to retrieve the user's information and pre-fill data on the form where applicable/available.  The form is then saved using our in_progress_forms process until the user has completed the form and is ready to submit.  

*Saved to Redis and then a Sidekiq job is created*

Upon submitting the form, the system retrieves the user's current information from EVSS:
 >     endpoint:/wss-686-services-web-2.6/rest/load/retrieve
 >     method:get

[See here for an example of json data received from EVSS](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/ebenefits/features/view-update-dependents/engineering/686-evss-form-data.md)

The system then takes the parsed form data received from the front end, and merges it with the existing veteran data received from EVSS in the previous step.

Once the form data has been merged together (previous existing data merged with the new data the user is submitting), the system makes a call to clean the form:
>      endpoint:/wss-686-services-web-2.6/rest/inflightform/cleanForm
>      method:post

Then another call to validate the form:
>      endpoint:/wss-686-services-web-2.6/rest/inflightform/validateForm
>      method:post

Then another call to save the entire form:
>      endpoint:/wss-686-services-web-2.6/rest/inflightform/saveForm
>      method:post

And finally. if all those steps are successful, the system calls the EVSS form 686 submission process:
>      endpoint:/wss-686-services-web-2.6/rest/form686submission/submit
>      method:post

## Additional Notes
* Use BGS VNP Services to establish claim information in BGS using VNP Services by populating the VNP tables in order to facilitate the processing by the VNP component of the Rules Based Processing System (RBPS) 

* VNP workspace = oracle tables - "snapshot of what the veteran has asked for" - staging area for transactional data that must be further processed before being accepted to Corp (*from [initial notes](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/ebenefits/features/view-update-dependents/discovery/initial-notes.md))

* RBPS leverages these in-flight tables instead of the authoritative data for 686 (*from [526ez discovery notes](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/2959be3a76d3b8b123b8a7977814c4518b186428/products/disability/526ez/discovery/evss-discovery-notes.md))

# View Dependents

## BGS
To retrieve a veteran's dependents, vets-api will be using the BGS ClaimantService/findDependentsByPtcpntId.  More information and example response data can be found [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/tree/master/VA-Systems/BGS/ClaimantService)

## Lighthouse BGS
vets-api will leverage the current lighthouse-bgs implementation to integrate with BGS.
