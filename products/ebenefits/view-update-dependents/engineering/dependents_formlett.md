## Feature Summary
The 686 form is complex. Comprised of up to 8 distinct workflows, the amount of time a user may spend completing a single application can be considerable. 
In thinking about future iterations of the 686, one of the questions we needed to answer was: "How can we reduce cognitive and temporal burden on our users?".
A solution we settled on was providing a formlett on the view dependents page that allows uesrs to remove dependents from their accounts without entering the 686 form itself. 

## Technical implementation
- Formletts are housed in the [ManageDependentsApp](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/c6d3a434f04c83cd5048f2b5f75282abb3726867/src/applications/personalization/view-dependents/manage-dependents/containers/ManageDependentsApp.jsx#L1) and are embedded in [ViewDependentsListItem](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/805f2dbd5816d992130dbd62baef2833335ab6f7/src/applications/personalization/view-dependents/components/ViewDependentsList/ViewDependentsListItem.jsx#L106) components for each person on award.
- Formletts are built with json-schema-form and are located [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/5e7c79ebf3e03c5c9d4b9d96f77f515699b5c811/src/applications/personalization/view-dependents/manage-dependents/schemas.js#L1).
- State relies on redux, and formlett submission is done asynchronously in an action called [submitFormData](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/c6d3a434f04c83cd5048f2b5f75282abb3726867/src/applications/personalization/view-dependents/manage-dependents/redux/actions.js#L29). 
- The [onSubmit handler](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/c6d3a434f04c83cd5048f2b5f75282abb3726867/src/applications/personalization/view-dependents/manage-dependents/containers/ManageDependentsApp.jsx#L30) tranforms the payload so it conforms to the existing 686 form schema. That [transformer](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/4e650b570f2eef9d8c3434ac798d00163358e974/src/applications/personalization/view-dependents/manage-dependents/utils/index.js#L195) calls an [adapter](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/4e650b570f2eef9d8c3434ac798d00163358e974/src/applications/personalization/view-dependents/manage-dependents/utils/index.js#L92) that handles the work of mapping formlett payload properties to the correct 686 schema form properties. 
- The original 686 form schema is located [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-json-schema/blob/f98b17ebbf3e351a8a306a8511567acc039b4689/src/schemas/686c-674/schema.js#L18)
- Veteran information is pulled from the user object and is transformed to fit the 686 form schema using [this adapter](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/4e650b570f2eef9d8c3434ac798d00163358e974/src/applications/personalization/view-dependents/manage-dependents/utils/index.js#L32)

## Outstanding Implementation Questions
- How do we maintain removal state across user session? Both remove dependent and view dependents rely on separate and distinct api calls. It's currently unknown if there is lag time between when a dependent is removed and when that status is updated in the data VA.gov gets back from the view dependents call. 
- Does an attribute need to be added to the view dependents api data for award status? Similar to the question above, how will the frontend track removal status? Does the 686 form submission already do this as a side effect? 
- Does claims status need to be included somewhere on the view dependents page? Users may want to check the status of their application in the claims status tool.
