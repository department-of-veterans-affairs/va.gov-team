This topline summary is a result of the synthesis that happens after conducting/observing research sessions. This is a high level summary of trends and analysis, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.

**The goal of this document is:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data

## Research Questions & Answers
**Do participants understand the 21-686c is a multi-purpose form? And do they understand and accept the "checkbox" selection of the various 686 workflows?**
 - All participants who were prompted with the add spouse & child flow were able to discern that the form was multi-purpose
 - When asked in a post test interview, participants who were prompted with multi-purpose form tasks mentioned that they would prefer to complete multiple tasks in the same form over doing them individually

**Are the forms presented clearly and easy to understand by Veterans?**
 - Overall, the forms were clear and easy for Veterans to understand
 - There is a need for some contextual help/definitions regarding specific cases (e.g. explaining why some info is needed)
 > “Just the VA file number and service number, maybe an explanation for that. I don’t know if the service number is the same as your SSN.”
 - Most participants stepped through the form quickly and did not require prompting

**Where do users need examples, guidance or section headers as they interact with the form?**
 - Participants stopped to understand the different types of marriages listed in the “add spouse” flow
 - Participants wanted to know what exact documents they needed to upload as proof to add their dependents
> “This is a lot of tax information that you may not have. I think this information should be included within the first page that you need.”
 - “What are the implications if I have reason for separation, if you are separated because you have jobs in two different cities. Are there implications to the benefits at all if you are separated?”
> “Are there implications if they have been married to someone that was in the military? A box that will explain what the implications are if they have va benefits already.“

**Where are the pain points in the longer workflows (add-spouse/add-child, add-student)?**
No major pain points were observed, but participants did stumble on the following:
 - Vague language around schooling (couldn’t discern between high school and higher education)**
 - Participants usually stopped to read the “type of evidence needed” sections of the forms
 - Participants often wanted to know why they needed to send certain information to the VA (address of ex-spouse, child’s financial history)

**What are users' experiences with the current 21-686c (paper, digital, VSO, etc.)?**
 - A few participants had experience using a paper form but did not know what it was called
 - One participant has used eBenefits to submit a 21-686c form in the last year
 - They mentioned that this process was similar to their eBenefits experience
 - One participant mentioned that the VA version was simpler to step through than the paper form

**Do participants know they have to report changes in their dependents status?**
 - There was only one participant who stated that they did not know they had to report when their child stopped attending school

**What workflow combinations (scenarios) do users think are likely?**
 - Some workflows fit together, though they may be done separately because of time (divorce & remarriage, add student/remove student)

## Hypotheses & Answers
**Users will accept the checkbox selection of multiple forms, but will be wary about picking too many workflows at once.**
 - All participants selected the appropriate checkboxes and did not have any questions about the options presented

**Users will require clarification or guidance at various points; The upload feature may create some confusion/frustration with its position at the end of the form.**
 - There was no confusion around how to upload, but some participants did question what types of documents they would need
 - Regarding birth certificate upload: 
 > “If it is for the stepchild where you have to put in the SSN. The VA could just run the SSN and see if the person is the mother or father. If I didn’t have it then it would just hold everything up.”

**Users may not be immediately aware of the change in workflow "chapters" as they navigate the form.**
 - All participants recognized when they were moving into a new “chapter” during the “add spouse & child” flow

**Some users will find the add-spouse workflow will be problematic in it's length and the repetitive section of former marriages. The "remove" dependent flows will be easily understood.**
 - A majority of participants questioned why they needed to provide some information to the VA (e.g. providing address of ex-spouse)
 - All participants completed the remove flow without hesitation or confusion
 
## Notes
**A few participants had been through the process of adding or managing their dependents but were not familiar with the term 21-686.**
> “...it was self-explanatory whereas the paper form I was not sure. I had to have the DAV assist with submitting the form.”

**Wayfinding/Navigating**
 - The biggest hurdle for participants was finding the form
 - Most participants looked at the Disability and Records boxes on the homepage before resorting to various sections of the “VA Benefits and Health Care” dropdown in the menu
 - When asked, participants stated they were looking for “something to do with dependents” or “add or manage”

**Most Veterans wanted to print the review and/or confirmation screens**
> “One this page where is says print this page for records, having a print button to click would be easier than having to go to the tool bar up top.”

> “Maybe being able to print it off to save it as a file, people like to have the evidence that they submitted it at this time and this is what I put in there.“

> “What I am missing is the form that I can print out that proves that I did it.”
