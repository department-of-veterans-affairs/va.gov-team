## Participant 10

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Aricka and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we&#39;re going to talk about adding and removing dependents to/from your benefits on the VA website.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.**  I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.**  We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran&#39;s needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You&#39;ll be interacting with a prototype.**  This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it&#39;s a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**  We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
  - If yes:  **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

_Start recording._

- \*\*I have started recording. I&#39;d like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?&quot;

## **Warm-up Questions**

Before we look at the prototype, let&#39;s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Please tell me about your service history.

I did 5 years in the army to 200-2005. In Korea for a year than station in Miami for 3.5 years.

- What are your experiences adding or removing dependents from your disability claim?

I was married a little bit over a year ago and added my wife online.

- Are you familiar with the VA 21-686 form? And what is your experience using the form (online or paper)?

Yes. That it was the form to add or remove dependents.

## **Screenshare**

Will you share your screen with me? I&#39;m going to send you a link. I will be asking you to complete a few tasks using this prototype. Try to move a bit slower than you normally would on a website and talk me through your actions.

## **First Task: Find and select form(s)**

You&#39;ve recently been married and want to add you new spouse and their child to your benefits. Show us how you would do this.

I am not sure because when I did it, it was through ebenefits. I am not sure going off of this page.

Where do you expect to find it on this page: On the top under disability.

What would you look for: something to do with dependency

## **Second Task: Step through form**

Walk through the steps of this form. Be sure to think aloud and comment on the process of walking through the form.

First impression: That it looks simple to get through. It has all of the information that you need to get through it.

Questions:

## **Third Task: Review application - X minutes**

Take a moment to review the information presented on the screen.

- Click the area of the prototype to complete this application process.
- Click add dependents. Click add spouse and child under 18.  Click continue
- Veteran information: It all looks standard.
- Address: If you had an account I feel like it would have the email already since it was a requirement to have an email to have an account. So it should populate as well.
- Spouse information: same information that it asks on ebenfits for the spouse. I think the difference is that the spouse information is all on one page where on ebenefits it is on multiple
- Marriage information: (Reads additional evidence needed).
- Thoughts: It is basic information needed to verify to support the claim. Other than that everything looks pretty simple.
- Live with spouse: clicks continue
- Married Prior: It is all simple
- Childs name: Clicks continue
- Childs place of birth: Clicks continue
- Child lives with you: some of the information on the child could be all on one screen.

What do you mean: Childs name and place of birth could be on one page and a lot easier. Everything for adding the child could be on the same page.

Additional evidence: if it is a stepchild the birth certificate would show you spouse . It is redundant because its my wife child.

Review:

What are the gray boxes for: it is going over everything that was filled in on the form to ensure that it is correct.

Expect for all sections: yes even though they are not all opening up.

Thoughts: I feel like if you are going to review your information you might as well review all of it because the other sections are the ones that you would make the mistake on.

Clicks I have read the privacy policy and submit application.

Confirmation page/impression: If there was a confirmation number because if there was an issue uploading and you go back in 3 months and it shows that it was not submitted.

Feedback: Its pretty standard for completion.

## **Fourth Task (if time): Remove**

Let&#39;s say that your step-child has moved out on their own. How would you go about removing them from your benefits?

I would go add or remove dependent. Click report the stepchild that left the household.

It is all of the standard from last time.

Supporting child-

What do you think it is for: if you don&#39;t have financially responsibility than you are not responsible.  Do you pay expenses is to expected and you pick the correct answer, fill out where the child it. It is pretty simple.

Review: Here is the information to review again. It would be good to review the information that isn&#39;t yours. Click I have read and accept the terms and click submit.

Confirmation: it would be good to have the confirmation number and if it goes months without the VA doing it the VA comes back and I owe money because they never took them off.

## **Post-Task Interview**

- Would you prefer to complete multiple tasks at the same time? Or individually?

Multiple at once.

- What are your thoughts on the length of the form?

Some of it seemed like there could have been more than one question on the screen at once.

- What are your thoughts on completing a form that requires this type of personal information?

I don&#39;t have an issue with it.

You mentioned the birth certificate being redundant: If it is for the stepchild where you have to put in the SSN. The VA could just run the SSN and see if the person is the mother or father. If I didn&#39;t have it than it would just hold everything up.

Compared to ebenfits: it is about the same

Difference, better, worse: the look of the web design is different but both are easy to put information into.

- What would you change about this prototype

Pretty much putting more questions instead of just one question on a page.

- What kind of device (mobile/desktop/tablet) do you use most often? Would you use that kind of device to fill this form out?

Desktop/laptop. Yes. Yes.

Where would you want to find this form: It would be under disability because it is a benefit due to my disability.

- Any questions for me?

Nope.

## **Thank-You and Closing**

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I&#39;ll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
