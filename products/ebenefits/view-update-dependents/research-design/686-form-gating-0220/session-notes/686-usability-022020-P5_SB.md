## Participant 5

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Aricka and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we&#39;re going to talk about adding and removing dependents to/from your benefits on the VA website.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.**  I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.**  We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran&#39;s needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You&#39;ll be interacting with a prototype.**  This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it&#39;s a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**  We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
  - If yes:  **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

_Start recording._

- \*\*I have started recording. I&#39;d like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?&quot;

## **Warm-up Questions**

Before we look at the prototype, let&#39;s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Please tell me about your service history.

I was at OCS when 9/11 happened and then services on the USS Abraham Lincoln and a security manager during IOF, IEF.

- What are your experiences adding or removing dependents from your disability claim?

Way back when all I did was sent in their copy of birth certificate.

 Added your children: Yes

Kids going to college: In about 5 years.

- Are you familiar with the VA 21-686 form? And what is your experience using the form (online or paper)?

I do not.

## **Screenshare**

Will you share your screen with me? I&#39;m going to send you a link. I will be asking you to complete a few tasks using this prototype. Try to move a bit slower than you normally would on a website and talk me through your actions.

## **First Task: Find and select form(s)**

Your child has recently started college and you want to add them to your benefits. Show us how you would do this.

First I have the box to continue to the new va.gov. Clocks continue to va.gov. I look to see if there is something already on the screen before going to search. Looking for something that has to deal with records, education and dependents. (reading page). I don&#39;t see anything there; I scroll farther to family member benefits front and center. First I would look at the rest of the page to ensure that is what I want. I go back up and click on family member benefits.

What are you looking for: Scanning the text to see what this page is about. It has va caregivers, messaging. Then it has benefits for spouses, depended and survivors. I look may at education and training but that&#39;s me transferring my unused GI bill to a dependent but that&#39;s not healthcare. I am not sure.

 IF not found here, what would you do: I would run a search.

## **Second Task: Step through form**

Walk through the steps of this form. Be sure to think aloud and comment on the process of walking through the form.

First impression: It is focused and basically you don&#39;t have anything over here or here to distract. It is good for older VA members. It has the VA form here, the note is great information then add/remove dependent button is helpful and easy to see unless you are red/green color blind. I know for red/ green color blind, yellow is better they are able to see it better. (Reading page). Then there is another button at the bottom and makes it easy because you don&#39;t have to go back up.

Click add/remove dependent. The click on claim benefits for child attending school. Click continue. I enter my information and click continue. The required buttons are great because veterans know their SSN but may not know their service number or file number. Knowing the required areas are helpful. You might even have everything with required be in bold so it is that much more visible. Right now the required aspect stands out because it is red and is set off by ( ) and \*. Then if you have bold on the screen it would be helpful to have the required items in bold.

I don&#39;t see anything that is not applicable. The address, I know this is a continuous probable for veterans that are homeless or in a shelter. I don&#39;t know if you could add camper or how that aspect works.

Information for student- (Reading page) You can add more than one child. Clicks continue.

Student address: What if the student was married, would it change? Clicks continue.

School of attendance:  Clicks continue

Course date: Now would there be, I have not seen something that says when this should be filed out. Like a week prior to school starting or 6 months. That question just popped into my head. Can you postdate this, I just found out I needed to fill it out and my child has been in college. Clicks continue.

Attend last term: That is ambiguous, if the student was in high school that is technically in school. Most people should mark yes because they were in high school last term. A lot of high schools offer in college class. For example there are kids that graduate with an AA because of dual classes. Clicks yes. It asks where they attended and it won&#39;t let me add the information. It has hours and number of sessions, that&#39;s great! clicks no and clicks continue

Students job: If they have a job hopefully they keep that job. This is a lot of tax information that you may not have. I think this information should be included within the first page that you need. It may be something you don&#39;t have access to if your child fills separately. Clicks continue. I know that when a child to get in state tuition rates they have to fill separate from parents. That may be something that should be on the first page.

Student investment: With the saves, investment, property.

## **Third Task: Review application - X minutes**

Take a moment to review the information presented on the screen.

- Click the area of the prototype to complete this application process.

(Reading page)

What do you expect the sections to have in them: the veteran&#39;s information would be my information, date of service, SSN, DOB, what I am eligible for. Yeah all of that information.

What about the next: it would be the student information, college information, classes, hours. That is what I would expect. The information that you filled out, if you said no than maybe it won&#39;t come up. Like the VA file number was left blank. I don&#39;t see any yes or no questions. Like did your child work, maybe it wouldn&#39;t show up or it would be a line by line that you filled out so you ensure that it was filled out correctly. I did see that there were edit buttons for each section.

I would click the box. I like the finish the application later, I would like that to be a bit bigger. I saw it on the other pages. Maybe next to submit the application there should be a finish the application later. Clicks submit.

It provides information, 1 week and do not apply again. The information to contact and not to apply again should be bold. It may need to be switched to have contact information first then please do not apply again in bold under. I would say that the sign in to va.gov is redundant. They should have an account if they just filled out the application. I would take that out. If they filled out the application they must have an account to apply for benefits. HealtheVet is misspelled. Everything else I see looks standard for a website. It tells you that there will be a packet through mail, check status on website but make sure you have the packet before you all. I think that works.

## **Fourth Task (if time): Remove**

Let&#39;s say your child graduated college and is no longer eligible for your benefits. What would you do to remove them?

I did happen to see that. I click disability benefits or maybe the home. I would click add or remove dependents from benefits. On this page that you need to have this on hand to have tax information.

How to remove them: Clock the button. Click that report child stopped attending school.  Clicks continue

Veteran information is the same. My address did not change but maybe it did. Then this is my child that is a lazy bum that wants to mooch off me but ill kick him out. View information, and child information is checked. All it says is that they are done. Click box and click submit.

## **Post-Task Interview**

- Would you prefer to complete multiple tasks at the same time? Or individually?

- What are your thoughts on the length of the form?

I thought it was reasonable. A lot of my experience with the va is doing this in paper or in person. Being able to have it online is very nice especially for veterans coming off of active duty now. The older veterans might not work out as well but they have a VSO to call for help. Older veterans may not be able to fill it out but they might not have a child that is 23, I mean they could have adopted.

- What are your thoughts on completing a form that requires this type of personal information?

I would want verification or a statement, some sites say it is a secure site. Some sort of verification. The va website has so many things that you enter in your health information or setting appointments so it is assumed it is safe. Really you are submitting it for your dependent and not your own information.

- What would you change about this prototype

One this page where is says print this page for records, having a print button to click would be easier than having to go to the tool bar up top.

- What kind of device (mobile/desktop/tablet) do you use most often? Would you use that kind of device to fill this form out?

I always use my computer. Yes. You have the keyboard; the tablet is awkward to do items like this when you have to type things out and a phone would be almost impossible. I don&#39;t have a smartphone.

VA.gov: I would expect it under records. Just because its not education, its not disability, it is changing your records, your dependents status. Now that I understand it more, I think I went to education first thinking it was an education benefit but it&#39;s not. It is a records change.

- Any questions for me?

## **Thank-You and Closing**

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I&#39;ll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
