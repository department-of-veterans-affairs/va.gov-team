## Participant 1

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Aricka and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we&#39;re going to talk about adding and removing dependents to/from your benefits on the VA website.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.**  I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.**  We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran&#39;s needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You&#39;ll be interacting with a prototype.**  This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it&#39;s a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**  We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
  - If yes:  **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

_Start recording._

- \*\*I have started recording. I&#39;d like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?&quot;

## **Warm-up Questions**

Before we look at the prototype, let&#39;s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Please tell me about your service history.

I was a linguist for 20 years, joined in 94 and retired in 2014. I was deployed 1 and has a 1 year remote. That&#39;s just about it really.

- What are your experiences adding or removing dependents from your disability claim?

It was relatively easy but it was easier than it was with DSFA. When I got married and got married and now that I have sent all of the paperwork it still has not reflected after 3 years. I have not had any issue adding my husband to the VA.

- Are you familiar with the VA 21-686 form? And what is your experience using the form (online or paper)?

No, not by that name.

## **Screenshare**

Will you share your screen with me? I&#39;m going to send you a link. I will be asking you to complete a few tasks using this prototype. Try to move a bit slower than you normally would on a website and talk me through your actions.

## **First Task: Find and select form(s)**

You&#39;ve recently been married and want to add you new spouse and their child to your benefits. Show us how you would do this.

First I would scroll down to see if it is in the boxes at all. It is not obvious here. I would go to the tab and click family member benefits to see what it says there. I am looking down the list to see if it is obvious so instead of looking forever I go to the search and place, add family members. I am looking for add or remove dependent.

First impress: It has a nice title and it is obvious what it is for. I like that it has what you need to have before you add someone. It looks pretty good I don&#39;t see anything obvious that would be missing.

Any questions: No not really.

## **Second Task: Step through form**

Walk through the steps of this form. Be sure to think aloud and comment on the process of walking through the form.

What would you do: click add or remove.  Click claim benefits for spouse and child, oh it only lets me do one or another.

Next: click continue. That is not my information. Click continue. Review the address and click continue. Fill in information then click continue.

Impression on the fields shown: They all make sense, there&#39;s not much. It only applies for when you are finished, is there any information on how long it will take them to respond. I would really like to see that because I haven&#39;t talked to anyone so I don&#39;t know what is going on with it and it would be nice to see this reflected within the next 2 or 4 weeks.

Next: Fill in information click continue. If I click others for marriage can I type it in. Maybe people that have had a proxy marriage would know what it is but an explanation may be good. It looks good. I don&#39;t see anything else than.

Feed back on live with spouse: What are the implications if I have reason for separation, if you are separated because you have jobs in two different cities. Are there implications to the benefits at all if you are separated. Other than that it looks fine.

Married prior- Are there implications if they have been married to someone that was in the military, a box that will explain what the implications to if they have va benefits already. I know that you want to keep this as clean and simple as possible but maybe a popup that someone can look at. Same thing with former spouse information because there are rules about the benefits that you can have.

Next: Adding child, click continue.

Feedback for adding a child: I see the if its not your biological child but a popup that explains the benefits for the child. What you can expect and what you cannot expect.

Questions/feedback: Maybe also that same thing. Like if you are marrying someone with a child and the child may already have benefits through the VA. That happens often that someone gets divorced and the one parent has benefits through the VA and the new spouse has benefits through the VA. Do both the parent and step-parent get benefits. It should explain how that works and not be extremely confusing. If the child has been previously married, then what&#39;s frustrating is people go through this than find out that they are not eligible. It would be good to have the questions upfront instead of after you have filled everything out. Have all the criteria up front that will tell you if they are eligible or not eligible.

Feedback for uploading evidence: It is straightforward it is just adding the information. You have a link to the additional evidence. It would be good to know what not additional evidence is. Like pictures or somethings that people think that it should that I am with this child. So it would be good to know what they do not consider evidence.

## **Third Task: Review application - X minutes**

Take a moment to review the information presented on the screen.

- Click the area of the prototype to complete this application process.

What do you expect the sections to do: I would expect to jump back and change or edit. It should show me what I wrote and if I can see it and edit what I put in. That&#39;s pretty much it, just being able to jump back instead of having to go from the beginning and going all over it again. No one ever reads the privacy policy. That&#39;s just about it. Maybe being able to print it off to save it as a file, people like to have the evidence that they submitted it at this time and this is what I put in there.

Next: Click submit.

Impression: It does say it will take one week but people are not satisfied with that. Some people like to know how many applications there are awaiting because of holidays or the people are on strike. I like the line at the bottom. I had one more question but I don&#39;t remember what it is now. I think this looks really good and simple.

## **Fourth Task (if time): Remove**

Let&#39;s say that your step-child has moved out on their own. How would you go about removing them from your benefits?

It says to go through the add or remove. Report that a stepchild has left the household. Go through to verify who I am, none of the information has changed. The child has moved, yes that is the information about my stepchild. Supporting stepchild still, click no. Say the child has moved out on their own, this says who the child lives with, it should have a box that has self since they moved out on their own and not with another. I am wondering if it is required to add the child&#39;s address. If it is a va thing that it has to be submitted I understand but I don&#39;t think it should be because it is being taken off of the benefits. The VA doesn&#39;t need to know the address because its not their responsibility and maybe the child doesn&#39;t want them to know their address. That is the only thing, if they have aged out but if they are just being removed I understand.

Review the application and submit. That&#39;s it and it has the same stuff as the other one.

## **Post-Task Interview**

- Would you prefer to complete multiple tasks at the same time? Or individually?

I prefer to do it altogether.

- What are your thoughts on the length of the form?

I think they were fine. I prefer but understand that you don&#39;t want to take up too much of the screen within information I prefer not to scroll as much so have as much information on one screen so you don&#39;t need to scroll.

- What are your thoughts on completing a form that requires this type of personal information?

The form must be done one way or the other if you want to get the benefits. If I don&#39;t feel like or like actually doing it on the computer you can fill it out and send it by mail. There is a choice. Some people don&#39;t like doing it on the computer so there should be a choice between online and paper.

- What would you change about this prototype

Not much really, it was well thought out for it being a child, step-child moving out. You should be able to click that they have left the nest and that should only be a one click thing and not put in their address.

- Favorite part

it was really easy. The fact that it had the information upfront that you need to fill out the form.

- What kind of device (mobile/desktop/tablet) do you use most often? Would you use that kind of device to fill this form out?

Usually my laptop. Yes.

- Any questions for me?

No I can&#39;t think of anything else. I think you guys are doing a good job.

## **Thank-You and Closing**

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I&#39;ll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
