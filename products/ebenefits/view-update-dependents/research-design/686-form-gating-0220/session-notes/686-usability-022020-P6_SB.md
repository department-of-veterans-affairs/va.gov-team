## Participant 6

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Aricka and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we&#39;re going to talk about adding and removing dependents to/from your benefits on the VA website.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.**  I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.**  We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran&#39;s needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You&#39;ll be interacting with a prototype.**  This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it&#39;s a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**  We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
  - If yes:  **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

_Start recording._

- \*\*I have started recording. I&#39;d like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?&quot;

## **Warm-up Questions**

Before we look at the prototype, let&#39;s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Please tell me about your service history.

I was in the navy, joined Nov  of 76. When active duty July of 77. Went through bootcamp then dental tech school and assigned to a dental unit in CA. After 2 years of active duty I sustained an injury of my spine. Have been quadriplegic since then. Rehab in CA. After rehab I moved out and started graduate work, received my degree at Cal State and moved to Northern Ca. Built a house, went through college for teaching credentials.

- What are your experiences adding or removing dependents from your disability claim?

So, in 2008 when same sex marriage was legalized. I am married and soon after that I claimed my spouse as my dependent. It wasn&#39;t federally legal than. Then when supreme court legalized it we were able to add Brad as my dependent. I don&#39;t remember if I did it on the website or if it happened because my older claim in 2008.

- Are you familiar with the VA 21-686 form? And what is your experience using the form (online or paper)?

I filled out a claim for dependent form.

## **Screenshare**

Will you share your screen with me? I&#39;m going to send you a link. I will be asking you to complete a few tasks using this prototype. Try to move a bit slower than you normally would on a website and talk me through your actions.

## **First Task: Find and select form(s)**

You&#39;ve recently been married and want to add you new spouse and their child to your benefits. Show us how you would do this.

I would look into va benefits and healthcare first. I realize these are clickable tabs with arrows. Then looking at the information I would look at family member benefits. That is not what I need.

What are you looking for: I would be looking for add dependents. Let&#39;s see if we go back (reading page). So this seems like a page for people that are already dependents and their eligibility. (Looking at drop down tabs and reading). Under pension (reading page), Managing your benefits is where I would want to go. (reading page).

## **Second Task: Step through form**

Walk through the steps of this form. Be sure to think aloud and comment on the process of walking through the form.

First impression: It is really clear, there is a nice header title to add or remove dependents. Then more formalized form number. There are good notes that state you are signed in and they can prefill the fill. That is good because it requires less typing. Then a blue button to click and start the process.

Add wife and stepchild: Click add/ remove button. It provides steps 1 of 3. It is nice to know how long and where I a in the process. (reading page). Claim benefits for spouse and child under 18. I am looking for a way to move on. Clicks continue.

Veteran information: The information is prefilled which is pretending to be me. Clicks continue.

Address: I will confirm the information is correct and click continue. Email is not required but I could put it in if I wanted.

Spouse: It asks questions, clicks continue.

Marriage information: Okay. If you select other than ceremonial it requires more information.

Marriage: Yes. I would put in the information and click continue.

Former marriage: I remember doing that on my form.

Child: Entering the child&#39;s information and place of birth. The child would be a stepchild and then the date of my marriage. Clicks continue. Yes they live with me.

Evidence: (reading page) Clicks continue.

## **Third Task: Review application - X minutes**

Take a moment to review the information presented on the screen.

- Click the area of the prototype to complete this application process.

Then I am able to review the information that I entered by clicking the plus sign but ill trust that it is all good. Clicks that I have read the privacy information which no one ever does and then click submit. (reading page.)

What I am missing is the form that I can print out that proves that I did it. It doesn&#39;t tell me. (reading page) I can check the status by signing in, okay. So what I expected to see was the form, I did see the information that I entered when expanding the section but I would like to have the form.

## **Fourth Task (if time): Remove**

Let&#39;s say that your step-child has moved out on their own. How would you go about removing them from your benefits?

Alright. That brings to mind really understanding dependency because if we get child support for the dependent. It seems like they would like to prove information on that. I would want to search for manage my dependents.

Let&#39;s look under hector, not clickable.

Please click on the va: Click add/remove dependent, report a stepchild under 18 has left the household, that&#39;s what I want to do. Clicks continue.

Veteran information: There is my information clicks continue.

Address: Clicks continue.

Child information: That was the child I had on my claim, clicks continue. Are you supporting the child, no because they are moving out. It asks who they live with, it would be there mother or father, okay continue.

Review: Than I can review the information. Accept and submit the application.

## **Post-Task Interview**

- Would you prefer to complete multiple tasks at the same time? Or individually?

I think being able to do it both at the same time is great, I like that! As long as doing it separately is still an option. It may be nice to have a tutorial video that can prep them for what they are doing, people do not want to read but if there is a video that walks them through the process and let them know what they need. I did see that it wanted me to have my SSN ready but there was a lot of information needed like a pervious spouse. I remember filling that out long ago, he was divorced over 20 years ago so wat was the date where was it. Those kinds of things.

- What are your thoughts on the length of the form? What are your thoughts on completing a form that requires this type of personal information?
-

I love that it is prefilled so that&#39;s great, especially when someone has a disability like myself so information that is already present in my ebenefits file is wonderful. Maybe if you are able to tab through things and fill it out that way and its nice to have. Otherwise it was a good experience. I was looking for the confirmation at the end. Even a conformation form or letting me know that the application was just emailed to me.

- What would you change about this prototype

No unless like I mentioned the video. Along the side it could be helpful to have notes. I know it was contextual as you went along but sometimes it is nice to have a question mark icon to get more information.

- What kind of device (mobile/desktop/tablet) do you use most often? Would you use that kind of device to fill this form out?

I am on a MacBook pro. I use that and an iPad and iPhone.

Which would you use: my MacBook pro.

Where would you have expected to find it on the home page: Under disability. It is under the disability benefits. After thinking of it,  it makes sense because you are adding them to your disability because if you don&#39;t have a disability than you can&#39;t add them.

- Any questions for me?

No.

Managing mailing address for the pharmacy, I have recently read that you can change your website within the va website and it will change it for the pharmacy deliveries.

## **Thank-You and Closing**

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I&#39;ll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
