## Participant 7

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Aricka and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we&#39;re going to talk about adding and removing dependents to/from your benefits on the VA website.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.**  I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.**  We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran&#39;s needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You&#39;ll be interacting with a prototype.**  This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it&#39;s a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**  We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
  - If yes:  **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

_Start recording._

- \*\*I have started recording. I&#39;d like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?&quot;

## **Warm-up Questions**

Before we look at the prototype, let&#39;s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Please tell me about your service history.

I was in the Marine Corps for 3 years in intel and decided that the service wasn&#39;t for me.

- What are your experiences adding or removing dependents from your disability claim?

I never actually had to do it because I did it all when I was on Camp Pendleton and they sent it in for me. I do have my daughter.

- Are you familiar with the VA 21-686 form? And what is your experience using the form (online or paper)?

Not by the numbers.

## **Screenshare**

Will you share your screen with me? I&#39;m going to send you a link. I will be asking you to complete a few tasks using this prototype. Try to move a bit slower than you normally would on a website and talk me through your actions.

## **First Task: Find and select form(s)**

Your child has recently started college and you want to add them to your benefits. Show us how you would do this.

I have no idea because I thought it had something right here about a dependent but I am not seeing it now. I don&#39;t know. Clicks on family benefits. I would expect to find more information like this. I wouldn&#39;t know what exactly what I am doing because she is already on there so I didn&#39;t know I would have to do anything. What would she be eligible for. Are we talking about healthcare benefits?

Clicks on dependents compensation. I guess I just don&#39;t understand what I am doing for her. If I am still alive than I am still getting the benefits so she wouldn&#39;t be getting my benefits.

## **Second Task: Step through form**

Walk through the steps of this form. Be sure to think aloud and comment on the process of walking through the form.

Feedback: I mean it is nice because it tells me right there to click on that. I like it provides the things I need to start especially the SSN if I don&#39;t know it off the top of my head. It looks good.

Clicks benefits for 18 o 23.

Veteran information: clicks continue

Address: Clicks continue

Students name: Clicks continue

Student address: It looks pretty clean which is nice. Is this her address on campus or her permanent address like mine. Clicks continue.

Which address would you enter: I would place her permanent home address.

School attending: Clicks continue

Course information: so as her parent I may not know all of this information and she may not know either if she just signed up for school so the official things might not be known. I guess you could guess that. Clicks continue

Information: if she were in high school and graduated but will be attending college, I would wonder if they are talking about high school or college.  Clicks continue

Earnings: Clicks continue

## **Third Task: Review application - X minutes**

Take a moment to review the information presented on the screen.

- Click the area of the prototype to complete this application process.

Looks at the information: I like that you can go back and look it is good to have it all right here. I would print this page out because I like hard copies but I like that Clicks I have read the privacy, I would expect to see any information that I have put in to see the term started if I had to get up and do something or wait for her to call back. It would look like the other information and it would be helpful for me to click edit and takes me right back to that page.

Feedback: I like this page where it tells you how long it takes them to make the decision so I don&#39;t check everyday for the next month so that&#39;s nice. Then I like how it tells you how to check on the status of the information and it is important especially when large amounts of time goes by. Then they tell you how you will be informed. I like it and it is straightforward.

## **Fourth Task (if time): Remove**

Let&#39;s say your child graduated college and is no longer eligible for your benefits. What would you do to remove them?

Click on add or remove, click report child has stooped attending school.  Just saying the word report, it annoys be I have to report to the VA. I feel like the VA is still my command and it irritates me. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t like dealing with the VA. Confirm all my information. Then when did they stop attending school, I don&#39;t know if it would be better to have the last day of semester.

Reviews information. Clicks I have read and then submit the application.

## **Post-Task Interview**

- Would you prefer to complete multiple tasks at the same time? Or individually?

- What are your thoughts on the length of the form?

I liked that they were short and to the point so that&#39;s nice.

- What are your thoughts on completing a form that requires this type of personal information?

I do it now so its just the VA. It is normally behind the login screen that takes 18 times to login so I feel it is safe. I don&#39;t have any problem being like here you go.

- What would you change about this prototype

Really just like I said at the beginning that you would need your child&#39;s information because that&#39;s not something I would think to have. I wouldn&#39;t have the term start dates and things like that.

- What kind of device (mobile/desktop/tablet) do you use most often? Would you use that kind of device to fill this form out?

My laptop. Using the internet my phone. Form: my computer.

Where would you expect it to be: that&#39;s what is confusing I don&#39;t know what benefits I am trying to continue her for. I would assume records.

- Any questions for me?

## **Thank-You and Closing**

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I&#39;ll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
