## Participant 8

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Aricka and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we&#39;re going to talk about adding and removing dependents to/from your benefits on the VA website.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.**  I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.**  We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran&#39;s needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You&#39;ll be interacting with a prototype.**  This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it&#39;s a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**  We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
  - If yes:  **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

_Start recording._

- \*\*I have started recording. I&#39;d like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?&quot;

## **Warm-up Questions**

Before we look at the prototype, let&#39;s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Please tell me about your service history.

I was drafted in 68, my brother was a lifer in the army and he saw I had good grades for leadership and told me to go to OCS. I did and was the second youngest to graduate and then a year leader I went to Vietnam, no one was killed under my command but the worst day of my life was a friendly fire. I left after 2 years as an officer and I was the first to go to college using the Gi Bill. I was airborne. I was drafted and I don&#39;t think we should see weapons on the streets in American and only police and military should have them.

- What are your experiences adding or removing dependents from your disability claim?

My wife but she passed 2 years ago. She was part of it when I got my disability and it took place in 2008. My son was able to use the education benefits, being married I got a compensation for her. I can&#39;t think of any medication for either but the money from the household was easy to get. When she passed it took a few months for them to realize that they overpaid and I had to go back and agree for how much they could take each time.

Son benefits- it was a paper form or I went to the VA Center near Germantown in PA. I had assistance there.

## **Screenshare**

Will you share your screen with me? I&#39;m going to send you a link. I will be asking you to complete a few tasks using this prototype. Try to move a bit slower than you normally would on a website and talk me through your actions.

## **First Task: Find and select form(s)**

Your child has recently started college and you want to add them to your benefits. Show us how you would do this.

Education I would go down here, I would go to disability to file a claim for compensation because I forgot who got the money me or him but it was to go toward his education.

Anywhere else: Go to records and download the benefits for the information for benefits. Then maybe apply for education benefits but I think that would apply for the GI Bill for me not him.

## **Second Task: Step through form**

Walk through the steps of this form. Be sure to think aloud and comment on the process of walking through the form.

Oh add or remove the dependents.

First impressions: It looks easy enough to follow (reading page), it looks pretty easy.

Clicks add or removed a dependent. Clicks claim benefits for child 18-23. Clicks continue

Veteran information: I would type in my information, I forget my va file number The service number is my SSN. Clicks continue

Address: Reading page, Clicks continue.

Student information: (Reading Page).  Clicks continue

Student address: Clicks continue

School information: Clicks continue

Term information: Woe all of this for 2020. Clicks continue.

Last school attending: Clicks continue

Student income: Clicks continue

Investment: Clicks continue

## **Third Task: Review application - X minutes**

Take a moment to review the information presented on the screen.

- Click the area of the prototype to complete this application process.

It is for the individual at the va to ensure I provided the correct information and they are able to confirm it and it is legal

What do you think is in the gray boxes: They want to confirm that age that he is and he is living where I claim he is living.

 Clicks I have read and submit information.

It says it was submitted, wait it&#39;s the 21st not the 20th.

Questions, impression: There is more information that I can save if I need to refer back to it and it tells me what I need to do if I need to remove him if he drops out and a number to call for questions.

## **Fourth Task (if time): Remove**

Let&#39;s say your child graduated college and is no longer eligible for your benefits. What would you do to remove them?

Well first I could call and find out what I need to do to do it online, then I would go to 21-686C form. I a clicking it now. Click add or remove a dependent. (reading page) I would fill this out. Clicks report child 18-23 stopped attending school.

Veteran information: Clicks continue.

Address: Continue

Student: clicks continue

Review: click I have read and accept than submit application. I have my own personalize vs home page, and it has the number at the bottom.

## **Post-Task Interview**

- Would you prefer to complete multiple tasks at the same time? Or individually?

- What are your thoughts on the length of the form?

It was moderate, wasn&#39;t that long. I think it is manageable.

- What are your thoughts on completing a form that requires this type of personal information?

No problem with that, I take part in a lot of studies for the benefit of society. I used to be a newspaper report so I have no problem with that.

- What would you change about this prototype

I can&#39;t think of anything.

I know you mentioned how many times: there was 3-4 times ,I think I forgot to click I agree.

Where do you think you would find this on the website: I would go with the disability or education.

- Any questions for me?

## **Thank-You and Closing**

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I&#39;ll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
