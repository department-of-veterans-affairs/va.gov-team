## Participant 4

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Aricka and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we&#39;re going to talk about adding and removing dependents to/from your benefits on the VA website.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.**  I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.**  We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran&#39;s needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You&#39;ll be interacting with a prototype.**  This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it&#39;s a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**  We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
  - If yes:  **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

_Start recording._

- \*\*I have started recording. I&#39;d like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?&quot;

## **Warm-up Questions**

Before we look at the prototype, let&#39;s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Please tell me about your service history.

Like when I was in? Well I did a little over 9 years in the Marine Corps and medically discharged in 09. I did intel for while in.

- What are your experiences adding or removing dependents from your disability claim?

No adding or removing but my wife and I are expecting a child. My oldest son has just turned 18 and I had to go through the process to keep him on until I graduates.

- Are you familiar with the VA 21-686 form? And what is your experience using the form (online or paper)?

I am not.

## **Screenshare**

Will you share your screen with me? I&#39;m going to send you a link. I will be asking you to complete a few tasks using this prototype. Try to move a bit slower than you normally would on a website and talk me through your actions.

## **First Task: Find and select form(s)**

Your child has recently started college and you want to add them to your benefits. Show us how you would do this.

You want me to go through logging in? No.

I don&#39;t know where I would go on here.

Say you are looking for the application, where would you go: I would assume that it would be under education benefits.

Show me where you would find it and start the application: I guess I would find out if they are eligible for va educational benefits.

Why: Nothing seems really clear where. It is more directed toward me than a dependent so I would go through that then it would ask me about his information instead of me and tell me if they are eligible.

## **Second Task: Step through form**

Walk through the steps of this form. Be sure to think aloud and comment on the process of walking through the form.

Impressions: It is clear, I feel like this is what I was looking for on that page that wasn&#39;t there. I would be able to follow the steps. I am colorblind but I assume it is a green button that says add or remove dependent.

Clicks 18- 23 years old attending collage and clicks continue.

Veteran information, feedback: Clicks continue

Students information: This is what I just did but the hard copy because he turns 18 while in high school. Clicks continue

Paper/Electronic- This is much clearer than the paper form I had to do. I am a fan of being able to do the process online rather than the hard copy.

Why was the hard copy harder- Up until this section it was self-explanatory whereas the paper form I was not sure. I had to have the DAV assist with submitting the form. I was unsure which sections I had to fill out. It seemed like I was filling it out for him to go to college but he is in high school. It was confusing that I received a letter in November that his benefits would be up due to him turning 18 and that it had to be filled out prior to the school year starting.

The note above make sense: Yes that is clear and I feel like I am in the right place. The form the DAV was telling me to fill out seemed like it was to tell them he was going to school instead of verifying that he was in school.

Student information: No questions. The questions are the same as the paper form right now. No questions, it is straight forward.

All the same as well: Yes. This is one area that on the form that the questions was the student enrolled into high school or college but then it asks which classes they are enrolled in. I just put high school; I don&#39;t know if that is correct but I though it was more geared towards them going to college. The same with hours or sessions per week.

The only thing I would say about this is that in my instance when they at 18 and in high school and doesn&#39;t work. The answer is no but earnings is required but I just said he doesn&#39;t work. Why is it required.

I feel like it just changed directions and it wasn&#39;t part of the paper form.

That was not supposed to be in there you are not divorcing your son.

- What are your thoughts on the length of the form?

Paper: It seemed to be about 2 pages.

Electronic: Up until this part it was the same as the paper form but this is easier because an electronic submission is faster than a hard copy paper.

How long do you expect to wait to hear something back: If it is electronic I would think 7 to 10 days. I submitted my paper version in December and still has not been approved.

## **Post-Task Interview**

- What are your thoughts on the length of the form?

Paper: It seemed to be about 2 pages.

Electronic: Up until this part it was the same as the paper form but this is easier because an electronic submission is faster than a hard copy paper.

- What would you change about this prototype

I don&#39;t know if I would change anything about it. It was self-explanatory. Seems like it would work fine.

- What kind of device (mobile/desktop/tablet) do you use most often? Would you use that kind of device to fill this form out?

This or my phone. It depends on what I am trying to do. Yes.

Where would you expect it to be: I would expect it to be under records because I feel like the education part should be geared more towards myself rather than my dependents. All dependent information should be under records unless there is a direct link for dependents under education.

Expect to find it under add or remove: I guess I would look for the word maintain.

Clarification: I don&#39;t think that would be more confusing but I am not sure it would be less confusing if that makes sense.

- Any questions for me?

## **Thank-You and Closing**

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I&#39;ll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
