#### How long will it take VA to make a decision on my application?
We usually decide on applications within 1 week. If we need you to provide more information or documents, we’ll contact you by mail.

If we haven’t contacted you within a week after you submitted your application, please don’t apply again. Instead, please call our toll-free hotline at 877-222-VETS (877-222-8387). We’re here Monday through Friday, 8:00 am to 8:00 pm ET

#### How can I check the status of my application?

#### 1. Sign in to VA.gov
You can sign in with your DS Logon, My HealtheVet, or ID.me account. If you completed this form without signing in, and you don’t have an account, you can create one now.

#### 2. If you haven’t yet verified your identity, complete this process when prompted
This helps keep you information safe, and prevents fraud and identity theft. If you’ve already verified your identity with us, you won’t need to do this again.

#### 3. Go to your personalized My VA homepage
Once you’re signed in, you can go to your homepage by clicking on the My VA link near the top right of any VA.gov page. You’ll find your application status information in the Your Applications section of you homepage.

Please note: Your application status may take some time to appear on our homepage. If you don’t see it there right away, please check back later.

#### How will I know if my application to add or remove dependents is approved?

We’ll send you a packet by U.S. mail that includes details of the decision on your claim. If you check your status online and see a decision, please allow 7 to 10 business days for your packet to arrive before contacting a VA call center.

#### What if I need to add or remove another dependent now or at a later time?
If something changes in your family status let VA know. Return to the 21-686c form, select the option that describes your family status change and complete the form. This will update our records and your benefits pay will be adjusted accordingly.

#### What if I have more questions?

Please call 877-222-VETS (877-222-8387) and select 2. We’re here Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. ET.
