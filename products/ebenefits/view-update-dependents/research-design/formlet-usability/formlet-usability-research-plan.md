#### Background

### Goals

#### Guiding questions
Various "removal" scenarios considered for usability testing:

- Divorce (spouse)
- Death of dependent (spouse, child or parent)
- Child marries (child)
- Child stopped attending school (child)
- (Potentially) Remove stepchild

#### Hypotheses

### Method
We'll engage in moderated usability testing conducted remotely using Zoom. Users will be given open-ended "tasks" set forth in a coversation guide, and their actions and feedback will be recorded. Participants will be recruited using Perigean. These users will be provided a link to the View Dependents prototype. Users will be given open-ended "tasks" set forth in a coversation guide, and their actions and feedback will be recorded. Observers and notetakers may be in attendance.

#### The process
- There will be a quick warm-up and introduction to usability testing
- The user will be asked to navigate to VA.gov 
- The moderator will outline a scenario (use case) for the participant to follow
- Users will be provided a link to the View Dependent prototype
- If time allows, the participant may be given additional "tasks"
- There will be a quick Q/A and wrap-up
