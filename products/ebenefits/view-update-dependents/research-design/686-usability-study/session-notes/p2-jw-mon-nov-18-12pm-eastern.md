## Participant 2  
Participant 2 is a retired 100% disabled vet that is unemployable.

### About the Participant
- live in Carlisle PA
- discharged in 1994
- was an engineer, then at the post office until I was rated as unemployable
- different opinions about the VA, medical is fine, but it can take some time to get appointments, education is fine.  recognition (3:48) is not great though.  VA isn't living by its own policy

### Participant Experience with VA.gov and eBenefits
- experience with EBN is positive and ok the way it is.  
- I don't like change, esp since I am older.  
- learning curve is hard
- feels like its geared towards younger soldier
- I go to EBN for medical: refills
- password changing too often
- 2FA is a pain
- myhealthevet doesn't connect the logins
- recently rated at 100% so I don't check much anymore

### Participant Screen Sharing
- on an iPad,  screen may have froze  
- talking through the walkthrough with no visual  
- EBN RD: manage benefits and view disabilities  
- sees login clearly  
- Can you describe this page?  
  - see TCDR as well as individual where they are service-connected and not  
  - feels more descriptive than old page   
- what does service-connected mean?  
  - service connected: happened while on active duty or if its a secondary to the first (while on duty)
  - beside it says. "how did I get this rating" and takes me to a YT video
  - that is what I expected from the link
- what could make this better for you?
  - it tells me everything I need to know without bouncing around
- what on the page tells you about the accuracy of the info?
  - another link tells me what I can do if I want more info
  - I would like to add the Presidents hotline number.  I am in several groups on FB and THAT comes up a lot.  10x a day.  or another option would be my local center bc my patient liasion was more worthless than tits on a warthog.  Excuse my language.  VA vet friend and his therapist hate eachother but can't see how to change it.  
  - I want some accountability with the actual person who can help me.  Most people won't ask questions.
  - Pressing numbers while on hold don't cut it.  Redirected without a person...those with PTSD it gets hard because I don't have patience.
- if you were to navigate away from this page, where would you go?
  - if I am done I would logout, but I don't see a button, drop down maybe?
- going over to dependents, can you describe that?
  - reads page
- what would you do to add dependents
  - sign in to see your dependents
  - "logged in"
  - shows dependents
- describe the page
  - listing dependents
  - apply to add
  - for each it says who they are, SSN, DOB, age, Change Status
  - dependents not on-award?  haven't seen that before
- If you clicked on Add Dependent what would you expect to see?
  - take me to an area to add a new dependent
  - down the right side it says more of the same from before
- looking at dep...does that feel complete?  add or remove?
  - read the paragraph about on-award vs not, so now I know
- open to follow up?
  - yes
- Thanks very much, looks like we are at time.
  - sorry for babbling
- No worries, we really apprecaite it.  Thank you so much and have a great rest of your day
  - Thanks you too!
