### Participant Screen Sharing
- if you wanted info on your rating, what would you do to find it?
  - having a hard time seeing the green login button
  - clicks through login
- if you were to look for your rating, could you see it and describe this page?
  - this is much easier, bc on EBN it doesn't show details like this
- can you see your TCDR
  - yes it says 80%
- and under that?
  - it shows the individual ratings but they don't seem to add up
- what on this page tells you how they got that number?
  - to the right, "how did I get this rating"
- can you see service connected vs not?
  - yes there is a medal and some don't
- whats the difference?
  - service connected incurred while on duty, non service connected is outside of that
- what would you like to add?
  - This is great, it shows what I want
  - maybe more of an official record would be good
- if something was wrong, what would you do?
  - call the number
- anything else?
  - live chat or a person who can answer a live chat
- if you needed to go back a page, how would you do that?
  - back button maybe?
- moving on to another screen, have you ever applied to have a dependent added?  What did you do?
  - yes, I added my spouse, by clicking in EBN and added a spouse
  - took a few weeks
- where would you go to add a dependent
  - I see add or remove dependent
  - would sign in on the green button
  - logs in
- if you wanted to add dependents, can you tell us what you see?
  - this is very detailed layout
  - shows who is on the award
  - change status, didn't know you could do that
  - blue button says add a dependent
- what would you expect after clicking that
  - expect add a dependent and be able to add proof
- can you tell who is on award and who is not
  - yes
-  speaking of change status, what gives you an indication as to what that would mean?
  - I guess I could modify the status
  - thats good, bc with my first marriage it took some time
  - this would be good to change immediately
- what on this page would help if you had a question or a problem
  - 1-800 number
- can you describe the difference between on award and not?
  - not on award would mean they are not on award
- anything feel missing?
  - some people don't like their SSN displayed
- can you define the relationships shown?
  - yes its in bold
- anything else missing?
  - 
- if you clicked change status what would you expect?
