## Participant 3  
Participant 3 is a Navy Veteran from 94-98, dealing with VA since 2001 when diagnosed with MS.

### Participant Experience with VA.gov and eBenefits
- familiar with EBN?
  - haven't been active since 100% but before that, about 3x a day looking to see if my rate had increase (80-100%)
- waht other sites do you use?
  - just EBN
- any other sites for info?
  - FB, Twitter, VA with MS groups
- if you were to go and look...
  - straight to ebn.va.gov and have to redo my password

### Participant Screen Sharing
- can you see where you would go to get your disability rating?
  - not sure
- Can you login?
  - oh yea
- Can you describe this page?
  - I can see a breakdown of my rating and it shows a lot of information
- Can you see your total?
  - Yes, but you need VA Math to see how that number came up
- how can you find more information?
  - links to claims and appeals would be good to add more
- what would you click on to see how that number was calculated?
  - oh yea the YT video, thats pretty good
  - theres usually not a lot of inforamtion about what things mean
- what suggestions do you have to add more info?
  - an explanation of the title and what those words mean
- an explanation of the injury would help?
  - right, like what is cognitive dysphoria?
- what is service connected or non-service connected
  - service connected means it happened on duty where non-service connected is pre-existing and the VA may still cover you
- what do you feel is missing?
  - this is pretty good, pretty decent, other than seeing what these medical terms mean
- if you needed help, where would you go?
  - just the number, but live chat would be great
  - what is Talk to Veterans Crisis Line now?
    - opens a screen that gives more info about immediate attention 
- anything else?
  - no it looks pretty clean
- your next actions?
  - just close the page, I don't see a logout button
- how would you go back?
  - (user clicks on breadcrumb?)
- have you ever added dependents to your claim?
  - yes, my wife and i tried to add our son when he went to college but it was so painful, we had to call.
- take a look and see if you can find a way to view your dependents' information
  - sign in to add a dependent
- what do you think the purpose of this page is?
  - where i can add dependents and hey here are my dependents
  - be nice to see what award they are on
- how would you add?
  - the big blue button
  - expect to see a form with all the relevent info, dependents not on award might be first to select and move forward with
  - it was definitely more difficult before and then there was no feedback: no one ever tells you you did it wrong.  Now it just goes dark.
- so you would look for more feedback?
  - oh yea, that would be great if it told me if something was wrong - when you call, they hold your hand at every step or even do it for you.
  - they have even called me back.  Website doesn't do that.
- we need to make note about feedback
  - yea its critical for us.
- we are at time but last question, would you be interested in a follow up?
  - 100% yes definitely
- thank you very much for your time, we will be in touch, enjoy the rest of your day
  - thanks you too
