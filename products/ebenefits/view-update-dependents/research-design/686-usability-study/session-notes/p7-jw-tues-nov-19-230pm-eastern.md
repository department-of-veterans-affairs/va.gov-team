### Participant Screen Sharing
- how in the past have you found your rating?
  - mostly online
- if you were to login, can you describe that?
  - yes I would click on the green button
- on the RD page, can you see what your rating would be?
  - yes, I can see my total and the individual ratings and what is service connected
- if you felt that it was incorrect where would you go?
  - first I would click the YT link and learn about it and next I would use the number
- anything else you would like?
  - chat would be great
- are you able to determine how your rating is calculated? is there any tool that you would use to see what that would be?
  - maybe a first time user could be presented with some info
- what else could we add?
  - effective date is good
  - be nice to see why things were denied
- can you explain the difference between service connected and not?
  - something happened while on duty, otherwise it would be something that was not on active duty
- for appeals can you see where you would go for that?
  - yes right here, this link
- can you click on that and see if that was what you expected
  - yes this is good
  - it might be nice for a first time user to go through some learning language to help explain this
- any other feature you think we should add other than chat?
  - yes chat
  - a number to call or click on an individual rating to send that info and have the VA call the Veteran back immediately and have that info avaialble
