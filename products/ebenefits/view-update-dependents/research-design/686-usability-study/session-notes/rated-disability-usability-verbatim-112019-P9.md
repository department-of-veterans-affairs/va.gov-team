**GoTo Meeting:** This conference will now be recorded.

**Moderator:** Okay. Do I have your permission to record the session.

**Participant 9:** Yes you do. 

**Moderator:** Thank you.

Okay, we're going to start with you telling us just a little bit about yourself: your service experience, maybe where you live, but particularly, general experiences with VA, with disability benefits and VA services.

**Participant 9:** Okay, let's see, I was in the Navy for four years. That was back in 1970 through 74. And in 1978 I was in a racing accident and broke my neck and spent about two or three months in a local hospital. And then they found out I was a veteran, and they switched me over and sent me to Milwaukee for rehabilitation. I was there for about three-four months or something like that. And then I was with… in the VA system for a few years, and then I got to back where I could walk again and my assets grew to the point where I could no longer use the VA. And that's so I was out of the VA system for close to 20 years, 15 years, something like that. 

And then I got divorced, which got rid of half of my assets, and that was about 1983. And I have used it extensively since then. It's been really wonderful. Got a number of power wheelchairs from them plus online medications, whatever they may be. And I've got a couple, well, four modifications to different vehicles. And just anything really that I've been in need of they have been willing to provide in a very timely fashion. 

**Moderator:** Sounds like you've had a pretty positive experience with VA services, so that's that's good to hear, really. Have you used any of the VA websites to manage or look at any of your disability benefits like VA.gov of eBenefits in particular, or                                                                    any other site?

**Participant 9:** Not to a great, great deal. I am somewhat computer literate, as I am able to navigate VA.gov and everything else pretty well.

And just, you know, almost anything I need, I got multiple phone numbers I just call up and that's how we do it. 

**Moderator:** Okay. All right. Do you use any other sites to manage any of your other VA benefits, healthcare, etc?

**Participant 9:** No. 

**Moderator:** Okay.

I'm going to paste a link in the chat window. And if you could just click on that and when you see the screen come up let me know, and I will make you a presenter. What I'd like to do is just get that on your screen and have you walk through. And I'll just have like a series of questions or small tasks, and we'll just see where we go. So I'm going to send that now. So can you see the link?

**Participant 9:** Yeah, yes I do. And just click on it?

**Moderator:** Yessir.

And then I want to click the [inaudible] down below I presume?

**Moderator:** Actually what I'm going to do is… I'm in the process of making the presenter. And that might give you like an option that pops up right away, to share your screen.

**Participant 9:** It does.

**Moderator:** Okay, if you would share your screen.

**Participant 9:** It’s not giving me that option. I got, share in gray and cancel.

**Moderator:** Okay. Is there a section of the GoTo controls that says screen sharing, or is there a set of icons and one of them might be a monitor?

**Participant 9:** Let me close this first window that popped-up.

Actually the share your screen thing is taking over the screen what let me do anything except click on it. 

Okay, can you click on it?

**Participant 9:** Well all it gives me is… Well, let's see… your entire screen, application window, or chrome tab. The last two are in gray.

It won’t let me click anywhere except cancel.

**Moderator:** Really? Okay, hit cancel then.

If that's your only option. And then, do you get some controls for GoToMeeting now that you've closed that?

**Participant 9:** Let me look here. Well, I've got a little chat box up that has that link in it.

**Moderator:** Do you have something like a set of icons or a box that says screen sharing with an arrow next to it.

**Participant 9:** I'm going to close this link. So now I can get to my deals. I have the little to two people thing next to it, I have a chat window, it looks like, and then my settings. So I don't have anything that appears to be a share type thing. 

**Moderator:** Okay. On my interface, it says that you're a presenter, but I'm going to go ahead and close this here. What I'm going to do is I'm going to share my screen. And we'll just do it that way. What we'll do is when we talk through it if there's something if you say “scroll” I’ll scroll up, down. If there's something, you say “stop,” “read,” “click-on,” “do that,” I'll just kind of be your remote mouse, I guess. 

**Participant 9:** Just a second. I've got a window the top, a deal at the top that touches everyone now. 

**Moderator:** Okay, try that!

**Participant 9:** View option: everyone. Who’s talking: Cameron… no that's just something different.

**Moderator:** Well, let's go ahead and do it this way. Truth is, I do it like this occasionally, because everybody's got a different sort of setup. Sometimes this is a good workaround for us.

**Participant 9:** Okay, I see your screen now. 

**Moderator:** All right, in probably what you're seeing is it flipping back and forth. There we go. Okay. What we're going to do is we're going to assume that you're needing to take a look at your VA disability rating, is that something that you do very often, if so, how often?

**Participant 9:** Don't believe I've ever done it.

**Moderator:** Never. Okay, do you have a VA disability rating?

**Participant 9:** I don't believe so.

**Moderator:** Okay. Do you know… you may have run into this… So what do you know about VA disability ratings, anything at all? I can give you a high level overview.

**Participant 9:** Hardly anything.

**Moderator:** Okay. All right. It's a, it's a percentage, it's a number, and it's basically rounded to the tens’ place. It's a percent of disability that will determine the certain amount of compensation. And there's a formula that's applied to it, and basically you go through different sorts of screenings, doctor visits and those sorts of things. There’s—from what I understand it's not something I've gone through firsthand—but there's a complicated set of steps that you have to go through, and you will have a total disability rating. And if you make a disability claim that will determine the amount of compensation that you get. So, in a scenario where, let's just say that you wanted to find out if you had one, or if you had you believed you had one where you don't find it. What would you do to kind of search for that? Just in general?

**Participant 9:** Well, let me back up just a little bit, as far as this percentage thing is. I am in the process of trying to get compensation for tinnitus. And what I've done so far basically is go to VA.gov and search for the form number 21-526EZ. And I started looking through that and I did this, just a little bit ago before we started talking. That's the process I started a couple weeks ago and I just got a deal in the mail this last weekend, saying that I need to download this form for the application. And as far as my disability rating, all I've ever heard really is, is I don't I don't pay a copay for, like, medication, because I'm considered catastrophic. And I don't have to do the income thing anymore. Or at least I haven't done it for like 15 years now. But I never heard of like a percentage put to it or anything like that. 

**Moderator:** Okay. So, um, again from just my distant understanding, the 526 form is the starting point for getting some sort of disability rating. And depending on what the percentage winds up being, there are certain benefits that stack up. So we'll just go with that because there's. There are scenarios where somebody's going to come in uninitiated, so we'll just take a look at that. So, if you… Let's say you went through the 526 form and they said yes, everything is great. It sounds like you're the sort of person that would just go to Google or to go va.gov and search, is that correct? Is that how you find things about VA benefits.

**Participant 9:** It's not.

I could… I have a network of a number of other veterans that are in my situation. And I'm also a member of PVA board member on the Paralyzed Veterans of America and it’s a good resource for finding out things… just haven't resorted to going to VA.gov very much.

**Moderator:** Okay, so you have phone numbers, and a lot of people that you could call.

**Participant 9:** Right. To answer to your question I could, if I thought of it as a resource that I didn't have elsewhere. 

**Moderator:** Okay, looking at the screen that you've got here we're just going to have a scenario where you you've come to this, and you're interested in finding out about your VA disability rating, if at some point the future you were to get it. What do you see going on here can you describe to us in just in general terms?

**Participant 9:** The green box, I would, I would probably just skim over the first paragraph, and click on that green box that says sign in or create an account. I would probably click on that. And I would go ahead and create an account or, I don't believe I have an account there now anyway. 

**Moderator:** Okay. Right. If you haven't logged in and looked at much online with the VA, there's a good chance you don't have that account, but I'm going to go ahead and click on that button since you indicated that. And what you're seeing here is a sign-in screen with the different login systems, and I'm going to advance past that. And this is going to take you to what you see right here. So, just taking a look at it, let me know if you need to scroll, can you tell me what you see and what you are what you see going on and what you think the purpose of this page is?

**Participant 9:** I would say it’s answering what would have been my initial question. What my disability rating is and it appears to be 80% in this example. If I wasn't in a hurry I would probably—that would satisfy what I was looking for. If I had a lot of time it was interested I might, you know, scroll down and look at some of the other things on there. Or I guess this is giving a list of what makes up that 80% isn't it.

**Moderator:** Okay. Right. Can you tell from the list, which of these are service connected, which are not service connected.

**Participant 9:** Yes, it says that: service connected or not service connected. 

**Moderator:** Okay, sounds good. In terms of knowing the difference between the two. Are you familiar with those terms service connected, not service connected? Do you know what that means.

**Participant 9:** Yes. 

**Moderator:** Okay. Now if you were to look at this, again, understanding you don't have this number, but let's say you've got a number and you're like okay that's not right. That's not what I thought that I would have for the total combined. What do you see on this page that gives you any sort of explanation or any sort of recourse, like what to do next.

**Participant 9:** Well, on the right side it says how to get this ready, and what to do if I disagree with it appears. 

**Moderator:** Okay. And I'm going to scroll down a little bit and just share Okay. Anything else

**Participant 9:** Yeah there's a phone number that I would call if I had questions which, if I didn't agree with a rating I probably would call that number. All right.
