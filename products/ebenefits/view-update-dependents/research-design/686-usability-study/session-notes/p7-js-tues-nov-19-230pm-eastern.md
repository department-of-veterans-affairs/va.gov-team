GTM: This conference will now be recorded. 
Moderator: Do I have your permission to record this?
P7: Yes, you do.

_Moderator: I'll share a link, ask you to click on it, then share your screen._

_Moderator: Tell me a bit about yourself._

P7: I'm currently at a 70% PTSD due to MTSD, my paperwork was lost a couple of times. I had to go to the ### VA to … I had to do a lot of it by myself. 

_Moderator: It sounds like you had to do this in person._

P7: I did a lot of it by myself going to VA. I used benefits every couple of days. I used VA.gov to schedule medical appointments, to add my son as a dependent to my disability claim.

_Moderator: I'm going to go ahead and send a link. Can you tell me when you see it in the chat. Click on the link, and it should open up in your browser. You're a presenter so you're sharing your screen. More instructions about sharing screen and XD._

_Moderator: You mentioned you have a VA disability rating. How in the past have you tried to find your disability rating?_

P7: Here it would say check your claim status. Or, every time I got my check that's how I'd check it.

_Moderator: Can you find a way and click it to see if there's a way to see your rating?_

P7: Get Benefits… Download VA benefits letter, what's a disability rating… 

_Moderator: Could you click that?_

P7: Which one? 

_Moderator: Oh, I'm sorry. If you were to log into VA.gov…_

07: I can sign in with my DS logon or ID.me…

_Moderator: We're pretending we're signing you in. Can you tell me what's going on here?_

P7: This tells me every single disability rating I have, my combined is 80%. My TBI is at 30%. Injury to lower back is not service connected, [lists all that she's reading off]

_Moderator: Looking at that information, we're going to pretend that it's yours. What on this page gives you instructions what to do next?_

P7: First, I can tell you it's wrong, that's 80% - that's not right. First thing I'd go to Compesation 101, then I'd call the 1-800 number to get information.

P7: I'd rather have a way to chat, Contact Us, a way to chat with someone, that would be a lot easier.

_Moderator: Looking at the individual disability ratings, you mentioned they're not right. Is there anything more that you'd expect to see how these numbers add up._

P7: The highest you'd get is 60%, because of… 

_Moderator: Is there anything we could add that would help you see if it's right?_

P7: Before getting to this screen, if there was a popup that said, here's how the ratings comes about. Even if it's just 30 seconds, after that, once they've seen the video, at least they have some experience to understand how the ratings come about. 

_Moderator: That sounds like a good idea, … the kinds of things we need to make note of._

P7: Yeah, that would be a big one. Just seeing the combined rating, I knew right off that was wrong, from my own experience.  I don't know if I'm supposed to be telling you it's wrong…

_Moderator: Looking at the way the information is laid out, the total combined and the individual disabilities. What do you think, what would you add or take away?_

P7: It actually looks very good. [Reads paragraph at top] If there was a note about why it wasn't service-connected, why it was denied, like a link, that would help.

_Moderator: Yeah, I can imagine the phone calls are a little emotional. The diff between connected/not, it sounds like you have some experience appealing. Can you explain a bit?_

P7: Like a TBI, a person got hit in the head, injury in the lower back - sciatica is longterm, degenerative, knee injury - did they have. Knee brace? It may not be service-connected. 

_Moderator: So, it is pretty self-explanatory to you. … Can you see a way to see an appeal in process?_

P7: Yes, right here.

_Moderator: Can you click on that, and tell us if it's as expected?_

P7: (Reviews the info,) … the self-explanatory - top find out why… Force them to see it the first time, so they don't get upset later. That would be a good thing.

_Moderator: Can you hit the back button? That's helpful feedback -- make them look at it first.  Looking at this page, the layout, is there anything you'd add to it to make it more helpful? You mentioned chat…_

P7: Yeah, a simple question that could be answered via chat, like my combined rating is wrong… if it's going to be something that you have to be able to talk with someone… like TBI, if you could call, if there's a way to click on it, and I think it's wrong, and then you'd be able to send that info to someone at the VA, and someone would call back right away. That way the VA can call them back, know who they're calling, and know what the question is before calling them back.

_Moderator: So you can get the info in front of someone, get the info right away._

P7: Yeah, the person hitS this, and now I know what to call them back about. 

_Moderator: Telling your story over and over again gets a little mundane…_

P7: It sure it does. Oh, yeah.

_Moderator: We've just got a couple more minutes… say you came in and everything seemed okay, what would your next step be?_

P7: I would want to see what my pay would be. 

_Moderator: That's good feedback. The last question I have, say you wanted to go back one screen. Do you see anything that would take you back?_

P7: You'd just go right here [pointing to the breadcrumbs]

_Moderator: We're pretty much at time. A lot of what you've said is really helpful. We collect this information, some is outside the scope of what we're working on, but you've mentioned quite a few things, and that's great. Would you be available if we reached out for a follow up?_

P7: 100%, I mean I didn't even give you the full half hour. I mean, I did the whole thing myself, so … Any time, if you have any questions, any time, anything. I had to prove to them, on the computer, and in person.

_Moderator: It sounds like you had a lot of frustration getting there, but it sounds like it's settled now._

P7: Well, yeah, I've helped other people, too. It's much easier to call the 1800 number, but having someone who has some information ahead really helps. If you ask for a supervisor, that's the worst thing in the world. You end up with the next…
