### Participant Experience with VA.gov and eBenefits
- Can you share some of your background in using the VA sites?
  - Relatively good experience with VA.
  - A little confusing
  - Aware of EBN, but they kind of blend together
  - Use it for myself and dependents, presecriptions, status in DEERS, 
  - would rather use computer than talk to people
- Any other sites that you use?
  - My HealtheVet, but I can't remember, I just use bookmarks
- Where would you go to see your rating?
  - start at one site and search from there.

### Participant Screen Sharing
- Can you share your screen?
  - yes
- Now that you have come to this page, can you describe what you see?
  - I would start on the left
  - haha its right in front of me in green, I would click the login button
- this is the typical login process
- coming to this screen what can you describe
  - right away I see my rating
  - easy to see where I can check my claims and appeals
  - can see my indivisual ratings
  - my TCDR is 80%
- If something was not right, where would you go?
  - use "waht if I have a question?"
- What else would you like?
  - the information on the right is helpful
  - Personally I would like to see an email or a live chat rather than call someone 
- looking at the page, can you tell what service-connected means?
  - service connected vs not is clear
  - service connected is a condition that the VA has accepted that you had a medical condition while in the service
- What feels missing?  What would you like to add?
  - there is a website, that has the VA's definition of what each of these conditions is so the Veteran can look and see, same for service connected
  - can you add a link to add a claim even though I can see check your claim.  I want to apply for a new claim
- can you see how the VA determines your rating?
  - "how did I get this rating" I would watch the yt vid
- now we are looking at dependents, have you done that in the past?
  - i have
- what was your experience with that?
  - my children were easy but i have not been paid for my ex husband yet
- how did you fix that?
  - I had to hand in written paper work the old fashion way
- can you see where you would add?
  - right away I see add or remove
  - there in the green its obvious i would login with the green button
- coming to this screen, can you describe what you see?
  - right away i see the blue button
  - the dependents are listed both on and not on an award
- to change the status, what would you click on to do that?
  - click on "Change Status"
  - i like that the buttons are different colors but they are maybe too complemetnary and I am not drawn to them
- if you needed more info?
  - I would like Contact us to have chat
  - I see the "get help link"
- can you tell which are on award and which are not
  - its obvoius right away
- any other thoughts?
  - its well put together and logically put together
