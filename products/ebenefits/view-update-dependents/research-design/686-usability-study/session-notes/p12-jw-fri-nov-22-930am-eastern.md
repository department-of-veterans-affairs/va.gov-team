### About the Participant
- 1966-1967

### Participant Experience with VA.gov and eBenefits
- how often have you used EBN?
  - In the last year or so, it was brought to light to me that a claim I had in 1968.  I had a facial accident and the VA said they didn't owe me anything.  Vietnam was a tough time and most people wanted to put it as far behind them as possible.  We were seen as an albatross.  My insurance said that was a preexisting condition and wouldn't support me.  I went back to the VA and went to 100% within 6 months.
  - I use My HealtheVet, DoD, sites like that.
  - As well as eBenefits
  - I will usually just call
  - 2 years ago I was diagnosed with terminal cancer due to Agent Orange
  - I have acute neurapathies
  - I only care that Agent Orange effects are showing up in grandchildren
  
### Moderator Screen Sharing
- what can you see on this page, where would you get your rating
  - I would need to sign in first, but there is a lot to view
  - clicked login
  - sees the RD tool page
  - I want to say that a lot of people aren't going to get that far.  Even the word Veteran is hard to use.
- Can you see your rating?
  - there are some things that are missing
  - there is a place to see claims and appeals
  
**Participant has many wonderful and interesting stories that took some time.**
  
- Thank you for your insight and participation.  Have a great day.
  - If you ever want to know the lack of evolution of the VA, go to Tent City in Jefferson Park across from the White House.  I have always had these curiousities and was the only one who read about Vietnam before I went over there.  Thank you.
