**GoToMeeting:** This conference will now be recorded. 

**Moderator:** Do I have your permission to record the session?

**Participant 10:** Yes, you do. 

**Moderator:** Thank you. Okay. To start out, could you tell us a little bit about yourself service experience, where you may have lived and any general experiences with VA or VA benefits? 

**Participant 10:** Um, I retired after 33 years with the air force. Um, I, uh, flew, I was a navigator, and I was injured in Somalia in ’92 and it wasn't that bad, but it caused a disease. I've got rheumatoid arthritis, but it also has this virus in it that I got in Somalia, so it's like a supercharged rheumatoid arthritis. So, um, I am, um, right now I'm 90% VA-rated. Um, they say I'm really over a hundred. I just haven't gone in and done things, but anyway, I'm fine with 90. Um, I get along okay. Okay. When you said where I've been? 

**Moderator:** Mm-hm. Sometimes it's nice to know where you live, where you're coming from. 

**Participant 10:** Well now I'm in Alexandria, Virginia, but I've lived all over the world, both monetary and out of the military. So lived everywhere.

**Moderator:** Thirty-three years in the air force! Yeah. You, you've seen quite a few places. Um, you talked about having a disability rating. Have you used eBenefits or VA.gov to look up anything about your disability rating or a dependence or any other benefits? 

**Participant 10:** I think I did in the very beginning when I first was getting signed up with the VA. They had me go on and get, you know, do my account and get the password and all that. But I don't think I've ever, after I got signed up, I don't think I've ever used it. 

**Moderator:** Okay. That sounds good. All right. What is going to happen at this point is I'm going to paste a link in the chat… can you see a chat window? 

**Participant 10:** Um, I think so. It says reply or reply to all. Is that it? 

**Moderator:** Do you see, um, something that looks like HTTPS… Uh, a link, like a web link starts out the Adobe XD. 

**Participant 10:** I closed down some of these things that are on here. 

**Moderator:** I think you can, um, they're little accordions. If they're like my interface, they're like little… there's an arrow and it says something and when you click on it, it opens and closes. You can close them so you can see more. 

**Participant 10:** Okay. 

**Moderator:** So do you see, um, something that says screen-sharing, attendees? 

**Participant 10:** No. Well, hold on here. Okay. Oh yes, I was talking Dave Gruber. I see that now. So that one has audio, screen and webcam. 

**Moderator:** Okay. If you were come down towards the bottom, there's nothing that says chat? 

**Participant 10:** Yes. Oh yes, yes, there is. Okay. You didn't have to tell me everything and this is fine. Okay. Yes, I've opened that and there is a link there. Okay. 

**Moderator:** Okay. Please click on that. What should happen is your browser should open up and there should be a screen. 

**Participant 10:** Yes. And it won't long. Oh, it's alright. It's cool. But it's blank. It's blank now. It's coming up. It's thinking about it. Okay. VA disability rating, it says. 

**Moderator:** Great! What I'm going to do at this point is I'm going to make you a presenter. Now. This is not a real screen that you're looking at. It's not a real, yeah, it's kinda like a real website but it's only semi functional. So only some of the things click. But when we talk we'll walk through some of the things and click on things and get your thoughts. So I'm going to make you a presenter and there should be like a box or something that comes up and says show your screen if you would show the screen that's got the, uh, the page that I just sent you. There we go. Beautiful. Actually you are, you're like a pro. Everything has been easy-breezy so far. We're doing great. Okay, so you have a disability rating with the VA and it's 90% and you've, you've been logged into eBenefits at some point or another. Um, we're working on moving eBenefits over and one of the things is disability ratings. And the other thing that if we have time we'll talk about is dependence. If you were to want to view your disability rating, what would you do to go and find that? 

**Participant 10:** Well, they send me a letter each year, which I keep, so I just got a letter. But I've never had to go online to look anything up. 

**Moderator:** Okay. Now a lot of people just use phones and they'll take the letters. So that's, that's a perfectly valid way to do it. This is an online version of—not necessarily a letter—but a way to look at that. So taking a look at this screen and you can scroll up and down, um, just give me your impression of what you think this is about and what's what it's meant to do. 

**Participant 10:** [inaudible] 

**Participant 10:** Let's see, kind of get rid of this window over to the right. Oh yeah, I can move it over. So that takes up half the screen. All right. Um, let's see. Well it says please sign in to view your disability rating. Now viewing your rating, I assume it's more than just what percentage, cause you already know what percentages does that tell you more? Like what you get with that percentage or something. 

**Moderator:** Um, and in terms of what you would see if you clicked on one of these buttons, is that what you're asking? 

**Participant 10:** Sign in or create an account? I just, I don't see if you already know what your rating is, there's no reason you would go in there unless it tells you more what you get with that or what's covered with that or something. 

**Moderator:** Right. That's actually really good insight. So what you're saying is that Hey, if you know it and you've got your number, it's in the back of your mind, why would you even come to a screen like this? So one of the things that you said that you might do is to find out what sort of compensation you get. Is that right? 

**Participant 10:** Well of course benefits are covered. Like you know, some, each percentage covers different stuff. As far as all I've done telling everything, 

**Moderator:** Right. Looking at this screen and you want to, let's say you wanted to go and see it and you, you hadn't received a letter, or you have some suspicion that it's changed. What do you see on this page that'll let you view that? 

**Participant 10:** Well the, the bar that says sign in or create an account, 

**Moderator:** Can you click on that and you can click any one of the three buttons there. That's a simulated sign in. If you pick your favorite color, they'll all work. 

**Participant 10:** All right, 

**Moderator:** There we go. So that would take you to a screen that you see right here. Can you describe a little bit about what you see on this page? 

**Participant 10:** Um, well your VA disability rating. Um, and then then it has the different things that supposedly I have and what percentage each one, uh, covers. And then it gives me that my combined score at the top. Um, that also notates which are service connected and which I'm not service connected and I'm all service connected in my own case. 

**Moderator:** Okay. Can you explain to us the, what the difference is or what you think the differences between service connected non-service connected? You probably know intimately but us and for the record, just to capture that info, the difference between the two. 

**Participant 10:** Well service connected or any disabilities that you get due to performing your duty. In my case, I was injured in combat, but um, other things you could get, like might be on duty but you might be playing basketball or something and that it would still be covered but not as service connected. Okay. It has to do with other things like once you've retired like I am and you get also your retirement service connected percentages are not offset by your, by your pension, but not service connected. They take some out of your retirement to cover that. It's just, it's not taxed. All they do is move it from the tax bucket over to the not text bucket. 

**Moderator:** So it's a pretty important distinction when it comes to compensation? 

**Participant 10:** Well, and I totally disagree with it. If you have a VA rating that is your rating and none of it should come out of your, um, I don't think any of it should come out of your retirement. The two things to me, and you've earned them both and I don't think it should be Rob from Peter to pay Paul. 

**Moderator:** Right. And those are the sorts of [inaudible] 

**Participant 10:** Can they separate? So I don't have that issue, but I disagree with it. 

**Moderator:** Okay. Um, that's a little outside the scope of what we have here, but those sorts of opinions are, are still very important because what happens is we capture this, we entered the record, you know, it doesn't have your ID or anything, but you know, 

**Participant 10:** So that'll be Dave Gruber's. 

**Moderator:** Yeah, that's right. “Dave Gruber.” But it's important to capture this sort of stuff because we entered the record and you know, what happens is it surfaces and most of the priority scale. So we pull that out. 

**Participant 10:** Okay. That's why. So that's, that's the difference. 

**Moderator:** Okay. Looking at this screen and if you were to come in and you wanted to see it and you saw something that you felt was just incorrect or wrong, what on this page gives you either an explanation or recourse? 

**Participant 10:** Well, they've got that same crazy phone number here that you can call that you never get anybody on, so you could buy that. That's the craziest place on her. Um, otherwise, let's see. Well, check your claims or appeals. So I guess you can appeal it. Since it was a bot, you can check your appeals. 

**Moderator:** What would you expect that that link would do for you? What if you were to click it and go to another page? What do you, what would you expect to find there? 

**Participant 10:** Well, it, it appears like you already have put in for a claim or an appeal. It doesn't appear that it's where you can start one, but you can go and check your status. 

**Moderator:** Okay. Can you hit the back button to go back to the screen that we said or there we were on. There we go. Okay. Uh, anything else on this page that explains the rating or why there might be a difference between what you know, where and what they're showing you? 

**Participant 10:** Well, you two are blank. I'm explaining your rating I guess. I guess as far as what percentage each type of disability gets, that's another thing. Just, I'm not for myself by talking to other people. Some things that you wouldn't think it would be rated high are another things you would think it would be rated really high. They get like 10% and so I don't understand their rating system at all. But for myself, since I just have the one thing and I think it's rated appropriately, I know I'm fine with mine. 

**Moderator:** Right. So for you it's easy, but for other people there might be some mystery or some question as to, you know, how these numbers don't seem to add up or why they should add up the way they do. 

**Participant 10:** Right. And how, as you can see here, the combined is 80 but if you add up the 30 40 and 50 you don't get 80 so why is this person that over a hundred so you know, some things add up and some things don't add up. 

**Moderator:** Hmm. Okay. Is there anything that you'd like to see to kind of help explain that to those people who, who have more complicated situations? What might help? 

**Participant 10:** Well, I haven't watched this YouTube thing. Maybe it does help. I don't know, but, um, of course there are thousands of different things that you can have wrong. So, you know, it'd be hard to have like just a lash card or a quick reference card that gives you the, what SWAT with each thing. But they could have maybe major things, some chart somewhere that has major, the more common things, um, we rate it and why they're rated that way. 

**Moderator:** Right. Okay. No, that sounds good. That's good insight to, um, some sort of, I mean, you, you understand that we can address all issues, but if there was some sort of way to do it in a, in a, in a broader, a wide sweep. Okay. That sounds good. All right. 

**Participant 10:** No, it's a matter of degree. Like, okay, they've got tinnitus here, 50%. Well, a friend of mine has tinnitus, he got 10%. So I'm sure it has to do with how much you're affected by it, not just the thing itself. 

**Moderator:** Right. My understanding is there is a complicated (for me) formula that takes a lot of things into account. So it's, it's not something that I personally understand. Um, looking at the individual disabilities here and the, the way the information is displayed, um, do you feel, how do you feel about that? Is it complete? Is there anything you feel like is missing or any other sort of function or feature you'd like to throw in there to help? 

**Participant 10:** Not really. I don't know. Um, I mean, of course there's a lot more behind it, but supposedly the person knows what it is they've got so they know how they got each thing and they know how much did affects their, um, quality life or their ability to move. And then, you know, like, like this has with the appeals up here, if you don't agree with it, you appeal it. And I understand that process is getting a lot easier. I've never done it, but I guess it used to be a nightmare and they're really making it a lot more accessible and more positive outcomes. 

**Moderator:** That's my understanding too, is that they're working really hard to streamline it and that it is, it's a work in progress, but they're, they're making steps. So it's, it's, uh, frustrating for some people, but hopefully it's easier and we'll get better still. We'll see how that goes. Okay. 

**Participant 10:** Question here. What are the top to say related to disability evaluation system and then the next two doll and then the next one does. So the ones that don't, what are they, why don't they say what they're related to? 

**Moderator:** [inaudible] that's actually you point out something that's, uh, that's very important, um, to answer your questions because that data doesn't come back. But the, uh, the question of why. So as a user, if you see that sort of information like, like you would right here, um, so you have a question about it. Is there any way we could address that question? What would you like to see?

**Participant 10:** Well, I guess I don't worry when it says it's related to the DES. What does that mean? And then whatever it is, it means why isn't there something similar on the other ones? 

**Moderator:** Right. Okay. So maybe some sort of explanation, you know, um, that we could show that when there are differences that points out why they're different. Is that what you're asking or saying that you'd like to see? 

**Participant 10:** Well, I guess so. I, I mean, I just think they should all be all have the same information. I don't know what the Des is or why, why they meet. I don't know why it's there to begin with, but given that it is there, why isn't it everywhere? 

**Moderator:** Gotcha. Nope, that's important to know. I know generally what it is, and I can tell you technically why it's not there, but, um, you know, that's, that's not what matters. It matters more of what a user thinks because the information has to be, you know, relevant and, you know, answer more questions than it causes. So I, I can appreciate that feedback. Thank you. Okay. Now last thing about this screen right here, just looking at it in general, does it seem to be complete? Uh, is there anything you would like to add? Any function, feature questions, 

**Participant 10:** But two that don't have effective dates? I think they all should have effective dates. I think that's an important piece of information. Okay. Um, 

**Participant 10:** What's already on the side here? Mmm. 

**Participant 10:** Well, yeah, yeah, right here it tells you you can file a new claim. Yeah. I don't know. It's um, if there's any kind of contact besides this phone number, it would be nice to include that because honestly that phone number, sometimes you don't get through on that for days. 

**Moderator:** Right. 

**Participant 10:** Let's, you leave a message and sometimes it doesn't. And if you do leave a message, sometimes somebody calls you back and sometimes they don't. It's a very [inaudible] and miss phone number. 

**Moderator:** Right. You are not the first person to point that out to us. So it's, it's something that when I do the, the analysis for this, we'll definitely surface that. It's outside the scope of what we can do, but you know, it's that information that we can bring forward. 

**Participant 10:** Well, my point was if there is another form of contact as well. 

**Moderator:** Yes, exactly. That is a good point. Okay, so some other, some other means of communicating besides the 800 number. 

**Participant 10:** Yeah. If you want to challenge something or if you have a question, maybe there can be a dedicated line for this or something or a dedicated email address or something. 

**Moderator:** Okay, that's a good idea. All right, we just have a few minutes left. Um, have you ever applied for a dependent to be added to your disability claim? 

**Participant 10:** I don't have any dependents. 

**Moderator:** No dependents. Okay. Um, with that said, I t a dependent screen, um, that I'd like to show you just to get your impression knowing that it's not your personal experience, but just to get your overall impression. So could you scroll to the top of the screen? 

**Participant 10:** [inaudible] 

**Moderator:** All right. And click on the your name. There you go. And now, um, just click on the VA logo that's over there at the top left. Click on it. Um, four times. It's going to step us through there. There four pages or four screens and we're going to click it again, please. Three, it could again until it changes. One more. There we go. Okay. And there we go. 

**Participant 10:** You could call it there. 

**Moderator:** I know. It's kind of like a backdoor for get us through. Uh, that's because a lot of times, um, you know, with certain people in their experiences, it's, it's important to focus on what, you know, we can get what their direct experiences and you know, so we need to be able to move around without having to click a bunch of stuff. Um, so on this screen, if you would just scroll up and down and see in a scenario where you might want to find out how to view or to add a dependent, see if you can find any information or any way to do that. 

**Participant 10:** Oh, Hey, um, let's see. Well, I guess he'd go through this checklist of are you this and are you that, what is a dependent, when should I add? 

**Moderator:** [inaudible] 

**Participant 10:** So is this just for kids or would this be like, if I got married, would my husband then be my dependent? 

**Moderator:** Yes, a dependent can be a spouse, a child, um, an a disabled adult child or a parent. 

**Participant 10:** Okay. Well. So down here then it says to sign in to add a dependent if if they fit all of these criteria above, I guess create a account for a dependent, 

**Moderator:** Would you mind clicking on that? That'll take you to another fake login screen and any of the three buttons would be fine to click on to advance. So in a case, let's say a scenario where you, you had a dependent parent or a, you know, an adopted child or something. I understand your situation is, is such, you don't have no dependence, but I'm looking at this screen. Can you tell what's happening here, what it does and what its purposes 

**Participant 10:** Well I think this looks like it's just registering your dependence that you have dependents. It's not for disabled, right, 

**Moderator:** Right. Not necessarily 

**Participant 10:** Bob Smith is my son, I guess. Um, child. So some are on your ward and some are not on your award. 

**Moderator:** Okay. So it's, it's clear to you which group is what and how do you know that they're on-award? 

**Participant 10:** Well it says dependents on an award. Dependents not on an award. 

**Moderator:** Okay. Now, if you wanted to apply to add a dependent, what on the screen would let you do that? 

**Participant 10:** Let's see. 

**Participant 10:** Well up at the top apply to add dependent. 

**Moderator:** Okay. What would you expect the next thing to be if you were to click on that? 

**Participant 10:** You want me to click on it? I think it would just be you register their information name, whatever 

**Moderator:** A form. It's not clickable, but I just wanted to to find out what, you know, the, the expectation would be, 

**Participant 10:** You see here on the name is, that's a form where you fill that data in and, and probably have to provide some sort of proof that they in fact are your dependent. 

**Moderator:** Okay. Yeah, that actually is correct. That is kind of how the process goes in a nutshell. So thank you for that insight. Um, again, if you looked at this information, you felt like it was incorrect in some way, what on this page gives you some sort of answer or recourse about why it might be different than what you expect? 

**Participant 10:** Well, I've got that. I mean, where would you go to to change it? 

**Moderator:** Um, if you felt that it was wrong, why or if you needed to change it, how either of those? 

**Participant 10:** Well, on the right it says, “What do I need to modify a dependent,” and then what if I need help with the claim that has the length that help filing your claim, which is good. Now, it’s got that same hard charging phone number. 

**Moderator:** Our friend the 800 number! Yes. It's okay. 

**Participant 10:** Oh yeah. I guess get help filing your claim if, if you fit the part up above for modifying a dependent, um, yeah, yeah, I guess maybe get help filing your claim. 

**Moderator:** Now if you had a dependent and um, there was a status change, what on this screen indicates what status changes are and what you might need to do? 

**Participant 10:** Well, you can hit the change status button there and it probably tells you the different things you can change. Um, but up at the top it says, when do I need to modify a dependent? Um, I don't think that's an exhaustive list, is it? I think there are more things that can happen besides these, 

**Moderator:** Right. There may be other outliers, scenarios. These are the main ones. Yeah, exactly. Okay. Well that, that takes us pretty much to time on this. And I, I know that this is not your direct experience having dependence on your disability claim, but I appreciate you giving us your insight on that 

**Participant 10:** Because you know, at any point I could end up with a dependent, you know, so true. It's here and what to do. 

**Moderator:** Okay. Yes it is. So hopefully we've, uh, we've, we've done our duty and conveyed some information there too, so that's great. Um, so that's everything that's on my list. Is there anything that you just want to talk to us about generally about, uh, you say that you don't use the website very much, but, uh, you know, that's what we're working on. If there's anything you'd like for us to know. Uh, I mean is there, it was just, 

**Participant 10:** I just, I mean, it's all me, you know, I just need to get on and start using it. I don't use VA benefits very much because I do have my Tri-Care and everything as well. So, you know, I pretty much just keep using what I've been using. But um, I probably do need to become more familiar with the whole, the whole VA site. You know, it's probably a lot of benefits. I could be taking advantage of that. I'm not, 

**Moderator:** That is possible. I do know that, uh, that there's, uh, quite a bit of information on there and we do hear from some of the participants who say, you know, I, I didn't know and we've heard from others that mine sites and run through and find out all sorts of things they did, they discover things. So I, it's not my experience. I don't know directly, you know, what, what to point you to but okay. That's, that's good to know that you would consider coming to VA DACA for as a source of information. Cause that's, that's our primary mission 

**Participant 10:** Is the GI bill on that site. 

**Moderator:** Mm. There is information regarding the GI bill on va.gov yes. If you go to the homepage, there is a, a box, a big box and um, you won't be able to click to it from this because this disconnected. But if you did go to VA.gov, to the homepage, there are four boxes. One of the boxes deals directly with education and it includes links to information for the GI bill. 

**Participant 10:** Yeah, I might have gone to that a couple times. I've had a real hard time using my GI bill and not been able to use it at all. People have had problems with that, with what they classify as allowable and not allowable. And they will be virtually the same thing. Um, you know, like they allow diving but they don't allow setting, um, you know, stuff like that. It's like, well, what, you know, 

**Moderator:** I'm with you.  

**Participant 10:** Well, you know, they'll allow you to go get a master's in art, you know, learn pottery, but you can't do something like with know, like I said, with sailing or with, um, yeah, even flying some flying things. You can, some you can't, um, some things they'll allow you to be an instructor in, but they won't allow you to take classes to learn how to do it. 

**Moderator:** That's pretty interesting. You can teach it, but you can't learn it. 

**Participant 10:** I’m at the end of my eligibility period now. And I have not been able to take one class one they approved and it was real short notice and they say, go ahead and pay it and we'll reimburse you. I took the class and then they said, well, I'm further review, we're not going to pay this. And I ended up paying for the whole class that I never would have taken except they said to go ahead and take it. 

**Moderator:** Yeah, that sounds pretty frustrating. I can tell you from some of the, uh, people that we've, we've talked to and some of the feedback that we, we've received, there are Facebook pages and Facebook groups where people are really specific with what they're looking for and what they're helping each other with. And then there are VSOC that, um, you know, are, are often a lot of help.

**Participant 10:** Yeah. 

**Moderator:**  So, I don't know if any either one of those might help. Um, I do know that va.gov has some information on it. I don't know how relevant it would be to your specific situation, but if you're getting to the end of your term with that, it might be, you know, time to get ahold of somebody and, and get that benefit before it's gone. 

**Participant 10:** Yeah, absolutely. I've been, I've been trying the last two or three years. Um, but here I am, I hadn't thought about the Facebook thing. Um, and the VSL is, are always helpful with everything. 

**Moderator:** Yes, that's a, that's what we hear time and again, as people really rely on those organizations. So it's, it's good that they're out there. Uh, and, and the VA knows, um, you know, they know a lot of what their shortcomings are and they're working hard to address them. And so in part online services, you know, the, the little corner of VA that, uh, I see on a daily basis, we're trying to, you know, get things shaped up and, and improved. 

**Participant 10:** I think the department is, and you know, I think the VA overall has just come forward leaps and bounds in the last like 15 years. 

**Moderator:** Hmm. Yes, I would, I would hope so. I think they've got a ways to go, but making steps, you know, and get some, a little closer to the goals. So that's great. Well, I have gone just a little bit over our time, so I apologize for that. 

**Participant 10:** Yeah. How do I make sure that I get credit for this and not a Dave Gruber? 

**Moderator:** Um, I'll talk to my contact; Peregian is the organizer for this. And you might've been in contact with a lady named Shannon. 

**Participant 10:** Yes. He's the one who gave me the link to get in. Well, she's the one who gave me his link, I guess. 

**Moderator:** Okay. What I'm gonna do is, as soon as I get off this call, I'll just let her know that this happened, and to reach out to you and just make sure that everything's okay. 

**Participant 10:** Okay, great. Thank you. This was enjoyable. 

**Moderator:** Well, I really appreciate it. And you went through this like a pro, so no worries. There you were, you know, super at moving around the screen and getting into the interface. So definitely one of the… uh, don't discount your computer ability. You did great! 

**Participant 10:** Yeah. Thank you. 

**Moderator:** All right, I'm going to stop recording. 

**Participant 10:** Okay.
