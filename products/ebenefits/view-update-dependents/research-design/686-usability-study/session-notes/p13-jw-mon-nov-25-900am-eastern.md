### About the Participant
- 

### Participant Experience with VA.gov and eBenefits
- how often have you used EBN?
  - I have a rating but it tool some time.
  - have been to EBN quite often to see what it was 
  - added my daughter for post 911 GI bill
- any other sites you have used?
  - My HealtheVet for perscriptions
- tell me about your first time?
  - it was in the mail in 2012
- online, what would you look for?

### Participant Screen Sharing
- what can you see on this page
  - I would login to get it and there it is
- can you tell waht your TCDR is?
  - yes right here 80% and in the text in bold
  - I can see the individual ratings as well
  (reads them)
- can you tell service connected or not?
  - yes I can see which are connected or not and with the ribbon
- whats the difference?
  - service connected is something that happened while in service 
- what on this screen tells you where to get help?
  - I see the number to call
- what else would you like to see?
  - I could also click on claims and appeals but other than that I would like to see morem info on an individual basis
- Where would you go to leave this page?
  - probably just close it or click back
- anything else on this page?
  - more info or explanation that would help with follow up o nmy part
(going over to depenedents)
- you mentioned that you have used EBN for dependents, can you describe that?
  - my daughter had to start using this herself now that she is over 18 and that as a little tricky
- the login is really far down the page so we wont look for that since you can't scroll
- can you tell what you would click on to add a dependent and what you would expect
  - i would expect to be able to add birthdate, address and all that
- can you see the dependents list and describe what you see?
  - yes I can see the members
- can you describe what you think on award means?
  - yes, they are associated with a benefit
- lets imagine you saw an error, what would you want to do?
  - Change status to modify probably
- clicking on disbaility benefits brings you to a page, what would you expect to see?
  - looks like just the definition
- what else would you like to see?
  - for me or for the VA?
- for you
  - maybe I would like to ensure the address is correct
  - as far as a benefits for dependents, this looks pretty clear cut although I can't see the award
  - it would be nice to change the benefit online as a self service and if the VA had questions they could call and ask (post 911 to chapter 35, for exmaple)
- this was a very valuble session and I would like to know if you would be interested in a follow up?
  - yes that would be fine
- anytihng else?
  - I appreciate the VA and al lthe work you guys do. Have a happy thanksgiving.
- thanks, you too
