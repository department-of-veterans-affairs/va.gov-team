Usibility testing was conducted using static prototypes of the Vets.gov implementation of the 21-686c form. There is evidence of five participants. A Conversation Guide and verbatim notes exist but no formal Readout or Analysis document. There is an "Outstanding Questions" doc that does include findings regarding participant sentiment and usability.
#### Session 2 June 2018

In June 2018, follow-up usability testing was conducted using the 21-686c form deployed to Vets.gov staging. Conversation guides were created for Veteran and non-Veteran participants. There are notes for sessions with four participants. A Research Readout document presents several key findings regarding the usability of the 686 form in staging, as well a general sentiment about the dependents workflow.
