### View dependents screen

#### Throughout
- [ ] URL for View Dependents should be `../view-change-dependents/view` (`../view-change-dependents/` is the static landing page from PubWeb) 
- [ ] ~~Change breadcrumbs~~ This should be updated when urls get updated (it should say what the page is: "Your VA dependents")

#### Header

- [ ] In H1, make "D" lowercase in "dependents"
- [ ] Make button blue (green reserved for authentication) 
- [ ] Button text should read "Add or change dependents"

#### Dependents on your VA benefits/Dependents not on your VA benefits

- [ ] Change no-record text to: "We have no record of dependents on your VA benefits."
- [ ] Style no-record text within gray DIV; like [background alert styling](https://design.va.gov/components/alertboxes#background-color-only), but F1F1F1 gray
- [ ] Padding-top in card/list should be 16px
- [ ] Dependents name in card/list should be title-case (upper and lower) rather than all-caps
- [ ] 🤷‍Dependents name font should be Bitter rather than Source Sans
- [ ] 🤷‍Birthdate should be formatted Month, day year, e.g. January 1, 2020
- [ ] 🤷‍SSN should be formatted with dashes, e.g. 111-22-3333

#### Sidebar
