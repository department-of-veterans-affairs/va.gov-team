# Research plan for usability testing for Form 21-686c / staging environment
**VSA eBenefits Team | May-June 2020**

`James Adams, designer/researcher`

#### Background
VA uses the 21-686c (686) form to collect and process the information to allow a Veteran to add or remove dependents from their disability claim. Including the 21-674, the "686" supports eight discrete workflows When deployed to VA.gov, it will be one of the longer, more complex forms on the site. The new 686 was designed and developed using the conventions and constraints of the VA.gov form system.

Usability testing was conducted using prototypes in [February, 2020.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/ebenefits/view-update-dependents/research-design/686-form-gating-0220) Follow-up testing on the form as developed and deployed to VA.gov staging will be critical to uncovering potential problems in the "live" product--and testing will be valuable in highlighting the path to optimizing user satisfaction and overall form performance.

### Goals
The over-arching business goal of the 686 is the quick automatic processing of the greatest number of digitally submitted forms. To support this, the new digital version of the form must be as clear and succinct as possible to increase accuracy and reduce abandonment. For users, the 686 is a potentially long and convoluted form; it is imperative to minimize potential  confusion and consolidate the form's flow.

#### Determine if users understand and accept the multi-purpose structure of the form
 - Observe users' interactions with workflows and combinations not tested in the prototype usability sessions (death, child marriage, divorce, etc.)
 - Observe how users interact with the form review accordions

#### Decide what support users need to navigate and successfully submit the form
 - Determine what instructions, guidance and examples will be helpful within form workflows not tested in the prototype usability sessions (death, child marriage, divorce, etc.)
  - Note any potential problems with list/loop feature

#### Determine if users identify cases requiring additional documentation
 - Confirm that introductory text informs users about upload requirements and what scenarios call for uploads
 - Assess users' understanding of "tell-me-more" accordions in workflows requiring uploaded documentation
 - Assess users' understanding of the upload process, and it's placement within workflows

#### Discover any problems that arise from longer/complicated chapter combinations
 - Determine potential issues with particular flows:
   - Add-spouse/report-divorce
   - Add-spouse/add-child workflow combinations
   - Add-child/add-student workflow combinations
   - Report-divorce/remove-stepchild workflow combinations

### Research questions
1. Are the form instructions clear and complete? Will users know what documents and info they will need to complete the form?
2. Do participants understand how the 21-686c works as a multi-purpose form?
3. What are the "sticking points" in the various form workflows? What workflow combinations cause users problems (add-spouse/add-child, add-child/add-student, add spouse/report divorce)?
4. Where do users need examples, more guidance or improved section headers as they interact with the form?
5. Will users understand when and how to upload additional documentation?
6. How will users interact with the form review accordions?
7. Is the information on the confirmation page clear and complete?
8. Can users complete the longer scenarios in a timely manner (per OMB timeframe)?

**Additional Questions**
9. What are users' experiences with dependents on their VA benefits, and the current 21-686c (paper, digital, VSO, etc.)?
10. What workflow combinations (scenarios) do users consider likely?
11. Where in VA.gov would users expect to find the 21-686c?

### Hypotheses
1. The paper version of the 686 is long and complicated, but the digital version should prove easy to use because it features user-selectable workflows and "step-by-step" chapter-based screens; however the form review accordions will prove challenging to participants because of page depth, and the potentially large number of section in longer workflows

2. Users will only scan the introduction screen, and will require additional clarification or guidance at various points (e.g. VA file number, dates within 674, financial questions)

3. Upload scenarios and requirements will need greater clarification. the actual upload process itself will be quick and easy, but users will be frustrated by having to scan/find documents.

4. Combination workflows will be long but relatively easy for users; the divorce plus stepchild combination may be problematic since it's long and requires detailed (potentially emotionally-charged) information.

#### Success
This research effort will be successful if it gives clear indications regarding the usability of the 21-686c (and 21-674) form flows so that final refinement can be made before product launch. Specifically, several things need to be determined:
 - Will users understand and accept the multi-purpose nature of the form
 - What guidance (instructional text, headers, etc.) will users need to support successful completion of the form
 - Will users understand when additional information is required; and how to upload it
 - Are there any workflow combinations that would be problematic for users due to length and/or information detail required

### Method
Usability testing will be conducted remotely using Zoom. Participants will be provided login credentials to a test account that will support their designated scenarios. These users will be given situations and a set tasks to perform. Workflows and tasks may be broken into separate groups, so users may run through the form multiple times. The moderator will guide and prompt users; observers and note-takers will document issues the participant encounter, as well as noting sections that users navigated easily.

This methodology allows for direct observation of users interactions with a near-final product. This will allow the team to capture real-time feedback on a "live" product.

### Participants and recruitment
Participants will be recruited via Perigean. The study will require 14 Veterans from a variety of service backgrounds. These participants will be divided into two groups of seven (+/-). Each group will be give a set of scenarios/tasks to complete using the form. This will allow full coverage of all workflows. Criteria include:

#### All participants
- 14 participants will be scheduled by Perigean
- All genders
- Computer access and basic computer literacy
- Total Rated Disability of 30% or greater
- Several Veterans (4+) with Total Rated Disability of 80% or greater and cognitive disabilities
- Sessions will run approximately 60 minutes
- We request that Perigean provide a note taker for all the sessions

#### Group 1
- Fits any of the following:
  - Have or had dependents; received or applied for dependents benefits
  - Has recently been married/divorced
  - Has experienced dependent status change such as, marriage, death, leaving school

#### Workflows for Group 1
- Add spouse/Report divorce
- Report death
- Add student
- Report student left school

#### Group 2
- Fits any of the following:
  - Have or had dependents; received or applied for dependents benefits
  - Has child (age 18 to 23) who is about to enroll or has enrolled in college
  - Has recently been divorced

#### Workflows for Group 2
- Add spouse/Add child
- Report death
- Report marriage of child
- Report divorce/Remove stepchild
