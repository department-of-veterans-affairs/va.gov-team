This topline summary is a result of the synthesis that happens after conducting/observing research sessions. This is a high-level summary of trends and analysis but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.
 
**The goal of this document is to:**
 - Ensure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - Gain insight from the team/stakeholders/designers to determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 
## Research Questions & Answers
 **1. Are the form instructions clear and complete?**
- Most Participants were confused by the wording of, 'What do you want to do' instructions
  > It is confusing when you change terms. 
  
- Some Participants did not know that you could choose more than one checkbox because it was not presented in the instructions
  > Confusing you had to add the child address: Yes but it was on me because I thought it was mine again so it is on me because I did not read it all. 
	
  > It would be nice to tell you that you can pick more than one. I did not know if it would let me load both but it loaded them so I wanted to see if I could do them all at once.

- The required documentation for stepchild was not clear to participants because it was limited to only non-United State residents
 	> Allowing people to know that you need documentations for stepchildren or adopted would be nice whereas if they are biological you do not need paperwork.
  
- The step "Information Needed to add a Student 18 to 23 years old" instructions were confusing because it instructs applicants to return to the start of the form
 
 **2. Are users aware of the documents and information needed to complete the form?**</br>
- Most participants did not read or scroll through the Introduction page but immediately clicked the “Add or Remove Dependents” button found 'above the fold'
- When participants were redirected to the Introduction page and then asked, "If you would have seen this, would you have read it?" They stated they would not have because of the amount of text, and it seemed canned  

- Observations after reading the Introduction page
    - The information was helpful
    - Bolded critical information was easy to scan
      * There were "Staging" issues; as a result, some participants were not able to view the Introduction page 
- User did not have any issues downloading documents
 
 **3. Do participants understand how the 21-686c works as a multi-purpose form?**</br>
- Checkboxes verbiage confused participants
  - Many users feared that if they altered their benefits by incorrectly selecting a checkbox it may result in VA taking punitive actions
  - The unclear wording caused participants to closely read the checkbox
  - A participant pointed out that because of poor wording certain dependent options the VA offers are not available
  - Generally, checkboxes worked well in selecting single and multi-flow scenarios
  > Yeah if it would just add on to it like click add another dependent instead of starting from the beginning.
  
  > It was okay, slightly confusing because of adding the stepchildren and over 18. 
  
  > Then can I choose more than one at a time.

- Participants would prefer to establish their dependents first and then define dependents and their specific needs
  > Where would you like the add on part: after all information is competed on the first person, it would say do you have any changes to make to currently dependents or add dependents. 

 **4. What are the "sticking points" in the various form workflows?**
- The introduction page does not state "check all that apply" leading a few participants to only select one option 
  > it would be nice to tell you that you can pick more than one
  
- Users were stumped by the “Ceremonial” option when selecting marriage type because users were looking for the words "church" and "Courthouse"
- It was unclear to participants what type additional documents were needed when adding a stepchild
- Users often questioned the amount of information needed for completion 
   - Examples:
      - School: address, student start date, term start date, past course information, hours, major, Child school address, etc
      - Previous marriages: spouse name, marriage start & end dates, state of marriage, etc
- Participants thought the form was long and redundant 
  > Why did you say awww come on: There are more questions
  
- Users were generally annoyed with having to enter contact information that VA already has: email, address, SS#, etc. 
- Some users expected that authenticated screens should reduce the number of items they had to input
  > I do not actually do all of these forms if I had to me would discourage by all of this paperwork. 
 
 **5. What workflow combinations cause users problems?**
- Participants struggled with determining what boxes to select when adding more than one similar type of child to the workflow; 
    - Often resulting in unknowingly adding an additional child dependent
   	- Needed to add two different types of children, a minor and an 18-23-year-old coed. 
  > Also like the 18 year old hasn’t left for college and they aren’t leaving the house for school so then there are child for 18 to 23 years old that’ll be attending school so you cant. There is no stepchild for over 18. You cannot make the same claim. 
  
  > If there is not a difference between a child and stepchild then there should be a difference in the wording and if there is not a difference then it should say any child in the household. And if there is a difference I could not claim either and I'd be done.
  
  > The birth certificate is needed no matter what because they need to ensure that your spouse is the parent of the child. 
	
  > What next: I would have to look at the information for the child because they are over 21 so I do not know if they would be entitled to any so I would go home.

 **6. Will users understand when and how to upload additional documentation?**
- Most participants bypassed the "tell-me-more" accordion
  > If you are not looking at it, it might be skipped right over so it would be nice to upload the evidence on one screen so you do not need to continuously check.

- Most participants were confused by the term "ceremonial" for the marriage type
  > Its not really ceremonial but it is kind of is. It leaves a lot of questions for me.
  
  > Additional evidence tab, does it help: Somewhat, but it does not answer about ceremonial. 

- Most participants were confused by the what to upload for a step/biological child
  > How do you think the page could be improved: Allowing people to know that you need documentation for stepchildren or adopted would be nice whereas if they are biological you do not need paperwork.
  
  > It might be based off the size; it depends on what people are trying to upload. 
  
  > It depends on the child’s medical issues. If the child is 17 then there could be 17 years’ worth of medical records. 

- Participants knew how to upload the document. 
    - As stated previously they did not read the introduction page so they did not have the documents ready
    - Resulting in them having to save their work and complete the form later

 **7. How will users interact with the form review accordions?**</br>
- Overall very positive feedback
- Easy to read and easy to edit if needed
- Subheaders used for the various chapters were confusing when presented again on the review screen
    - one user expected there to be different or additional information in the accordions
 
 
 **8. Is the information on the confirmation page clear and complete?**</br>
- Was not able to be tested because staging would not allow applications to be submitted
 
 **9. Can users complete the longer scenarios in a timely manner (per OMB timeframe)?**</br>
- Yes, completing the form was easy and effortless, even the large one
- One participant used a new device and no mouse and still completed a multi-purpose form within 2 minutes
- One participant completed the form with the primary using the keyboard
