## Goals
The goal of this research is to understand user comprehension of the existing Power of Attorney Feature and user Payment History practices in eBenefits, as part of the digital eBenefits migration to the VA.gov website. This includes:

### 686 Business:
The over-arching business goal of the 686 is the quick automatic processing of the greatest number of digitally submitted forms. To support this, the new digital version of the form must be as clear and succinct as possible to increase accuracy and reduce abandonment. For users, the 686 is a potentially long and convoluted form; it is imperative to minimize potential confusion and consolidate the form's flow.

### Determine if users understand and accept the multi-purpose structure of the form
 - Observe users' interactions with workflows and combinations not tested in the prototype usability sessions (death, child marriage, divorce, etc.)
 - Observe how users interact with the form review accordions

#### Decide what support users need to navigate and successfully submit the form
 - Determine what instructions, guidance and examples will be helpful within form workflows not tested in the prototype usability sessions (death, child marriage, divorce, etc.)
  - Note any potential problems with list/loop feature

### Determine if users identify cases requiring additional documentation
 - Confirm that introductory text informs users about upload requirements and what scenarios call for uploads
 - Assess users' understanding of "tell-me-more" accordions in workflows requiring uploaded documentation
 - Assess users' understanding of the upload process, and it's placement within workflows

### Discover any problems that arise from longer/complicated chapter combinations
 - Determine potential issues with particular flows:
   - Add-spouse/report-divorce
   - Add-spouse/add-child workflow combinations
   - Add-child/add-student workflow combinations
   - Report-divorce/remove-stepchild workflow combinations

## Research questions
1. Are the form instructions clear and complete? Will users know what documents and info they will need to complete the form?
2. Do participants understand how the 21-686c works as a multi-purpose form?
3. What are the "sticking points" in the various form workflows? What workflow combinations cause users problems (add-spouse/add-child, add-child/add-student, add spouse/report divorce)?
4. Where do users need examples, more guidance or improved section headers as they interact with the form?
5. Will users understand when and how to upload additional documentation?
6. How will users interact with the form review accordions?
7. Is the information on the confirmation page clear and complete?
8. Can users complete the longer scenarios in a timely manner (per OMB timeframe)?

**Additional Questions**<br/>
9. What are users' experiences with dependents on their VA benefits, and the current 21-686c (paper, digital, VSO, etc.)?<br/>
10. What workflow combinations (scenarios) do users consider likely?<br/>
11. Where in VA.gov would users expect to find the 21-686c?<br/>

## Hypotheses
1. The paper version of the 686 is long and complicated, but the digital version should prove easy to use because it features user-selectable workflows and "step-by-step" chapter-based screens; however the form review accordions will prove challenging to participants because of page depth, and the potentially large number of section in longer workflows
2. Users will only scan the introduction screen, and will require additional clarification or guidance at various points (e.g. VA file number, dates within 674, financial questions)
3. Upload scenarios and requirements will need greater clarification. the actual upload process itself will be quick and easy, but users will be frustrated by having to scan/find documents.
4. Combination workflows will be long but relatively easy for users; the divorce plus stepchild combination may be problematic since it's long and requires detailed (potentially emotionally-charged) information.

## Success
This research effort will be successful if it gives clear indications regarding the usability of the 21-686c (and 21-674) form flows so that final refinement can be made before product launch. Specifically, several things need to be determined:
 - Will users understand and accept the multi-purpose nature of the form
 - What guidance (instructional text, headers, etc.) will users need to support successful completion of the form
 - Will users understand when additional information is required; and how to upload it
 - Are there any workflow combinations that would be problematic for users due to length and/or information detail required

## Method
Usability testing will be conducted remotely using Zoom. Participants will be provided login credentials to a test account that will support their designated scenarios. These users will be given situations and a set tasks to perform. Workflows and tasks may be broken into separate groups, so users may run through the form multiple times. The moderator will guide and prompt users; observers and note-takers will document issues the participant encounter, as well as noting sections that users navigated easily.

This methodology allows for direct observation of users interactions with a near-final product. This will allow the team to capture real-time feedback on a "live" product.

## Participants and recruitment
Participants will be recruited via Perigean. The study will require 14 Veterans from a variety of service backgrounds. These participants will be divided into two groups of seven (+/-). Each group will be give a set of scenarios/tasks to complete using the form. This will allow full coverage of all workflows. Criteria include:

### All participants
- 14 participants will be scheduled by Perigean
- All genders
- Computer access and basic computer literacy
- Total Rated Disability of 30% or greater
- Several Veterans (4+) with Total Rated Disability of 80% or greater and cognitive disabilities
- Sessions will run approximately 60 minutes
- We request that Perigean provide a note taker for all the sessions

### Group 1
- Fits any of the following:
  - Have or had dependents; received or applied for dependents benefits
  - Has recently been married/divorced
  - Has experienced dependent status change such as, marriage, death, leaving school
- Workflows for Group 1
  - Add spouse/Report divorce
  - Report death
  - Add student
  - Report student left school

### Group 2
- Fits any of the following:
  - Have or had dependents; received or applied for dependents benefits
  - Has child (age 18 to 23) who is about to enroll or has enrolled in college
  - Has recently been divorced
- Workflows for Group 2
  - Add spouse/Add child
  - Report death
  - Report marriage of child
  - Report divorce/Remove stepchild

## Key Findings
- The participants  **prefer to add a dependent** first and then add the dependent’s details.
- The form's **verbiage was unclear** to participants resulting in:
  - Steps left incomplete
  - Unreported dependent(s)
  - Hesitating to complete the form
  - Seeking help from the VA
- The majority of participants thought the forms were **easy to complete.**
- Participants bypassed the introduction page and had mixed reviews about its usefulness.
- Participants **disliked the length** of the forms because:
  - Questions about marriage were considered numerous and irrelevant.
  - Questions about dependent's education were considered numerous and irrelevant.
  - The VA should already have their contact information.

### Additional Findings:
- **Veterans are worried** they will be financially penalized by the VA if they make a mistake.
- Participants would **prefer accessibility to the entire form,** instead of completing all required fields before proceeding to the next step.

## Top Findings
**The participants would prefer to first add a dependent and secondly add the dependent’s details.":**<br/>
The study shows a contrasting approach between how participants wanted to add/update dependents, and the how the form wants participants to enter dependents information. Participants wanted to add a person first instead of defining how the VA will categorize the dependent.
  > Where would you like the add on the part: after all information is completed on the first person, it would say do you have any changes to make to currently dependents or add dependents.

 > Filling out your dependents then Add or change other dependents, if not hit continue.

 > I want to circle back about the fine detail about each individual once they are in the system. Get everyone in and edit a special case.

 > Sees it similar to older veteran- filling out form add or remove the list of names and checkmark the people and list of options why you want to remove them

The different approaches cause confusion, but clearer instructions and verbiage could help. The participants chose to omit information because they worried inaccurate information might affect them negatively.  However, they likes that ability to enter multiple applications at once because it saved them time and effort.

**Unclear verbiage:**
The lack of clarity in the instructions and tasks was the most substantiated finding.
- The lack of understanding resulted in:
  - Incomplete steps
  - Unreported dependents
  - Submission of incomplete form
  - Soliciting clarification from a VA representatie

- Participants' list of additional comments included:
  - Inconsistency in language,
  - Confuisng:
     - Titles to steps
     - Language for the checkboxes
     - Instructions
  - A lack of comprehensive instructions
  - How to select multiple children
  - The Review page's accordions labels were confusing
  - Uploading Document's instructions for stepchild were not clear
  - Defining marriage courthouse and church marraiges as ceremonial

**Exmples of Unclear Verbiage**
  - Incomplete steps
      > Personally I would ignore it and go to the next one.

  - Unreported dependents
      > I would not bother to put kids on.

      > Honestly, I do not have my son as a dependent because I am afraid it will screw up my payment.

  - Submission of incomplete form
      > No idea on the VA File # for spouse.

  - Soliciting clarification from a VA representatie
      > If not online, I may go in and asking a person directly.

"Add" and "Claim" are examples of the inconsistent verbiage.  Using one term consistently would reduce the user's confusion.
   > It is confusing when you change terms.

   > What would you prefer it to say, keep the same language

The step titled "What do you want to do?" was another example of an area in which instructions confused the participants.   Participants were unclear on how to update a child because the instructions did not distinguish between step-child or biological child.
   > Child? Not a stepchild? Not clear!

   > Two different types of persons and apparently they do not get the same benefits and claim the same way.

Another example confusing workding.
If you’re claiming a dependent child 18 to 23 years old who’ll be attending school, and if you never received benefits for this child, you must also select the “Claim benefits for your child under 18” checkbox below. (image)

The checkbox verbiage limited the types of dependent benefits offered by the VA.  Some checkboxes specify "step-child" while others specify "child".   By default, this inadvertently limits the options veterans have to select.  There are no options to choose for a biological 19-year-old going college.  The only 19-year-old college student option is for a 'step-child'.
  > I look at that and say it.. it would not be an option.

  > (I am) confused, not sure, reading all the options. I guess (clicked the first bock).

Participants were unclear on what to select when adding multiple children.
   > It would be nice to tell you that you can pick more than one. I did not know if it would let me load both, but it loaded them, so I wanted to see if I could do them all at once.

   > Should reflect any child on the household.

For step "Information needed to add a student 18 to 23 years old" the instructions did not resonate with participants, unsuccessfully alerted the applicants, and may result in issues when submitting the form.  To rectify the problem, the applicant will have traverse the form.  Two participant was not sure if they needed to restart the form.

  > Confusing! Kind of redundant they are over 18, but they are saying to collect under 18.    If they are over 18, they have to click under 18 also? You should not have to click to separate things. They should just have one. Dept 18-21 going to school.

Note: ...... If you never received benefits for this child, be sure you selected the "Claim benefits for your child" checkbox at the beginning of this form. image

The Review page's accordion labels confused some participants. Overall most participants understood the purpose of the Review page. However, the participants were not sure about the fist accordion content because of its label "What do you want to do?".
   > What does?.. What do you want to do?(step's title) Mean, I did what I want to do.

The Uploading Document's instructions did not define the required documents for a step-child living in the US.
  > The birth certificate is needed no matter what because they need to ensure that your spouse is the parent of the child.

  > Does not make scene, wording is confusing. You will have to have the birth certificate  “if you live in US”  birth place is not a option.

   > I would send birth and marriage certify showing proof.


The step-child section did not display the same format as other children types. As a result, participants found it more challenging to determine what type of documents are required. IMage
  > A way to break out, open

  > (I am) Not seeing the stepchild listed. Every other thing is in bold except for stepchild.

Marriage types: Participants were not sure how the VA defined "ceremony" as a marriage type. They were looking for  "church" and  "courthouse." Other participants remarked that all the marriage types are some type of ceremony.
marriage image
 > Ceremonial? Mean church, not legal?

 > I don’t know what it means, I can guess, but I do not know.

 > What is courthouse- hover over add more items. Personally, we got married in the courthouse. That is what I am looking for.

**Positive Feedback:**
Every participant liked that:
- The form was easy to complete
  > It was clear and straight to the point.

  > One participant completed the form in under 2 minutes with a new device and no mouse.

- Multiple applications could be completed at once
  > More than one just clicked on it- doesn’t say more that one, figured the system would do more than one, nice to say multiple scenarios can be completed on the screen.

- The input titles were clear and easy to understand.
  > I think it was nice that it was all into one and told you what information was needed to move into the next screen.

- Error prevention messages were clear and helpful.
  > Oh I need ten digits
  > Yeah it easy it says it right there

- Required fields were clearly labeled.
  > Marking the one required was really helpful. Some veterans don't know what the asterisk is.

**The introduction page's usefulness had mixed reviews.**
- Instruction often was ‘below the fold’ for users
  > I just saw the Add dependent button.

- Users bypass instructions and immediately click CTA button (See image below)
  > Like, a quick checklist, I don't know this was on the first page.

- Few users read the form instructions even when prompted
  > It looked liked canned VA statements, you know, boilerplate text.
  > There are a lot of choices, someone that is older at this point, they will get a little confused.

- When the moderator redirected the participants to read the page:
  - Found information easy to locate
  - Found the information helpful
  > Reading through the directions- bold is nice- if don’t read bold pulls the eyes (scanning)


**Lenght of the form:**
The participants remarked about the process being lengthy and redundant:
- Reentering previously provided information
   > All this information should be in the system. Is the child in the system yes
   > Deer would have already auto-populated the information for me.

- Entering a large amount of detail regarding education
   > But major is kinda crazy!
   > Does it really matter the exact start date of the child really going to school.

- Providing current spouse's previous marriage details
   > Lot so information good grief.
   > When were they marred this is confusing, this the part of the oh my god. I would be discouraged by all this paperwork

One participant felt the less information entered and reviewed by a "VA Human," would reduce the chance; the form will be flagged.
  > Screw up something.. this is going to screw something up because human is involved.  There is no room for human interstation..be honest.. human messing with anything with my benefits I try to avoid it.

## Additonal Findings
**Fear of repercussion drives inactions:**
Many participants voiced their opinion that they were hesitant to take any actions that could negatively affect their monthly VA stipend, which they rely on.
  > I would not claim any child. I don’t want them to come back later saying you owe 3,000.00 dollars for money I don’t have. Stop with benefits.

   > If they’re making 12,000th a year, they cannot be dependent. Then the kid will work less than that.  Maybe offsetting their collage bills or what to eat. Offset their wanting to take specific jobs

   > Fear is compounded by not knowing where to turn to get it fixed, get someone on the phone to help you, and not sure how to fix it.

**Complete as much of the form in the first pass:**
Participants prefer access to the entire form.  The Form System is structured so each step must be completed in its entirety before continuing to the next step. Once in the form, the system limits the user's ability to know the necessary resources to complete because you can only see one step at a time.  The Form System's piecemeal design negatively affects the application's ability to gather all needed information at once. To submit, the form the user must keep reentering the form until completing each step. Opening up the entire form allows veterans to gather what information they need to complete the form in the least number of attempts.

-This approach to the Form Suystem's design affects the socioeconomic veterans the most because they may."
  - Not have easy access to a computer,
  - Not have information readily available
  - Not have transportation to a public computer.

These socioeconomic veterans may also heavily rely on VA services.
 > People fill out forms and don’t have half the information. If it at home they have it next to them. Or if it’s a library a or hospital computer the information is not available it’s a second trip and a more barriers.


## Next Steps
- Meet with team to review findings and discuss design recommendations
- Create mockups and conduct a usability test.
