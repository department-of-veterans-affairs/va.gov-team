Welcome to the View Rated Disabilities tool page.

After the Veteran logs in, they can view this page.

If the Veteran has a VA disability rating, the top gray box will show the total combined disability rating. Here, that number is 100%.

Below the total combined disability rating, there may be one or more gray boxes that show the Veteran's individual disabilities. If a disability is service-connected, there is a percentage shown, and the disability's effective date. The effective date is the day the Veteran started, or will start, getting benefits for that particular disability.

It is important to mention that these numbers are not an average or a sum but actually the product of a larger calculation within the VA. A link to a calculator can be found here to investigate that further.

Some disabilities are noted as service-connected, while other are not. Service-connected means that the injury occurred while actively in service. It is important to note that there are other injuries involved, even if they do not contribute to the Veteran's over all total disability rating.

Some disabilities are not service-connected. The VA has decided that these disabilities were not the result of, or not made worse by, a Veteran's service. These may be awaiting a decision by the VA. There is a link in the top section for a Veteran to click to Check their claims and appeals.

A link to a YouTube video that explains the calculation process can be found here.

A link to the disability calculator can be found on the "About VA disability ratings" page

In the event that there is no data to show, a blue message will appear indicating this and in the event of a system issue, a red message will appear with the VA.gov help desk number to help resolve the issue.

For any other questions or inquiries, the number for the VA hotline can be found here.
