# "View My Documents" Additional Discovery: Notify Me of Debt Letters

## WIP

## User Stories

_As a Veteran logged in to VA.gov I want to understand that I owe a debt to the VA, and I want to take steps to address that debt._

## Considerations

This discovery should be added to discovery during View My Documents.
- How do we know when a Veteran owes a debt?
- At what point to debt letter get added to eFolder?
- How can we know when a document is added to the eFolder?
