### Initial findings
The My Documents feature strongly complements the Claim Status Tool; so much that their functionality should be merged or at least co-located. Documents, documentation, submissions, letters, etc. could be easily conflated by users, so some consideration should be give to either strongly differentiating user-uploaded documentation from downloadable VA letters, or to creating a documentation "hub." Research is need to determine users' expectations.
