# Research Plan for SSO, Alert Updates on VA.gov Manage Benefit Pages, February 14, 2020

1. **What product & team?** SSO
2. **Background**: 5 Manage Benefit Pages need to be updated from linking to just My HealtheVet to linking to both My VA Health (Cerner) and My HealtheVet. To start, Cerner users will also need to use My HealtheVet to manage any care received at a non-Cerner facility or any health records older than 3 years. Our research objective is to discover if design directions for alert box updates enable participants to understand what the arrival of My VA Health means for managing health benefits online via VA.gov Manage Benefits pages.
3. **Research questions**: Do our screens enable participants to comprehend the arrival of My VA Health? What, if anything, do participants find unclear? What questions or feedback do participants have about My VA Health? Does one direction facilitate comprehension more than the others? Why?
4. **Hypothesis**: It's difficult to estimate which of the 3 design directions prepared might resonate most and lead to clearest comprehension. We expect that Veterans will have some questions about what My VA Health is, what it might mean for their care, and why they need to use it (although this is not the main purpose of this research, some answers to these questions are prepared at the bottom of the discussion guide). We expect that Veterans may have some confusion over the similar names of My VA Health and My HealtheVet. We expect that Veterans might question if they can see a comprehensive view of care received across facilities within one management portal.



## Method 

1. What method of research are you planning? Remote, moderated feedback session and comprehension testing and a series of medium-fidelity, static screens housed within a single Invision prototype.
2. Why this method? We will also be inviting team members to observe and participate in deriving insights. Conducting sessions remotely will enable the most team participation.
3. Where are you planning to do your research? We will use an Ad Hoc Zoom account, and use the Chat functionality to send direct links to participants. We will ask them to share their screen. 
4. What will you be testing? We will be testing an Invision prototype.



## Participants and Recruitment

Participant criteria:

1. All participants should have experience with VA medical care/VHA

3. Both Women and men
4. **No** assistive device users. (Our Invision prototype will not be accessible to people using screen readers.)
