# Research Plan for SSO-Login, SSOe, March 26, 2020

## Goals
### What product & team are you doing this research for?
- SSO-Login Team
- Outbound SSOe (single sign-on from VA.gov to other VA sites)


### Background
VA.gov aims to provide a unified digital portal with access to all VA services. In certain instances, however, Veterans are directed out of the VA.gov platform in order to message their healthcare provider (MHV), check on the status of benefits claims (eBenefits), or access health tools that have moved to My VA Health (Cerner). When users need to navigate between multiple platforms to access benefits and tools, they are in many cases asked to re-authenticate each time. This results in a fragmented experience that may discourage users from interacting with the VA online. The goal of SSOe is seamless navigation for any user redirected between health tools or benefits housed on multiple platforms.

We have split up outbound (from VA.gov) and inbound (to VA.gov) launches. This testing will test outbound SSOe.  


### Research questions
- Do users understand what single sign on is?
- Do they have any questions or concerns about it?
- Do users have questions or concerns about SSO after navigating through flows between multiple VA sites?


### Hypothesis
- Users will understand the benefit of SSO  after they experience it, and hopefully understand it from the plain language used in SSO communication modal
- Users might not stop to read the modal unless we direct them to
- Users may not notice the redirects that SSO brings to their sign in experience

### Method
- User acceptance testing
- Remote moderated, via Zoom
- Testing from staging.va.gov.
- This type of testing will allow us to observe how users react to SSOe as its happening. Much of the work on SSOe is back-end development work with no discernable change to the end user experience. However, we want to validate that end users do not feel their experience is negatively influenced in any way by SSOe. We especially want to ask users to go through flows where we are aware there are some small UX inconsistencies, and ensure the UX solves we have developed for these moments in the SSO experience do not cause significant confusion for end users.
