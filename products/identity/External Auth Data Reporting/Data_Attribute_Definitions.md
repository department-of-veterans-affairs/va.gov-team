# Data Attribute Definitions

Below are the consumer-friendly definitions (along with examples) for each of the Data Attributes that will be included in the External Auth Data Report.

### 1. Monthly Active Users
- Refers to the total number of active confirmed users who sign into VA.gov and the VA: Health and Benefits mobile app at least once within a given month.
- Example: If a user signs in three times in a month, they are counted as one Monthly Active User for the reporting period.

### 2. Total Authentications
- Refers to the total number of sign ins for VA.gov and the VA: Health and Benefits mobile app within a given month.
- Example: If a user signs in five times during a month, this counts as five Total Authentications.

### 3. Credential Usage
- Refers to the percentage of Total Authentications for VA.gov and the VA: Health and Benefits mobile app that are made with each credential provider within a given month.
- Example: If there are 100 total authentications in a month, and 60 are via Login.gov, 30 via ID.me, and 10 via MHV, the Credential Preference would be 60% Login.gov, 30% ID.me, and 10% MHV.
