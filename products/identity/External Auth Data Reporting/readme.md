# External Auth Data Reporting

## Overview: 
External Auth Data Reporting is a project designed to create a standing data report to share with VA leadership and others surrounding the full authentication process.

There are basically two goals of this initial phase of the project:

- Define the data we want to report.
- Display and explain that data in a way that is easy to understand and report upon.

This is a part of the book of work that maps to _O1KR2: VA.gov authentication SLOs are developed._

## Problem Statement: 
The data produced by request from the Identity Team is often not instantly understandable and can be misinterpreted or misrepresented. 

We want to create reporting on the data that VA will find useful and easily understandable, and ensure that there is a way for them to access that data on a regular basis.

## What's In Scope (MVP): 
Here are the things we propose to report upon in the MVP:

**Quantitative Data**
- Monthly/Daily Active Users
- Total Authentications
- Credential Preference
   - Which CSP are people using to login per month?




## Out of Scope: (for this iteration)

### Moved to Out of Scope After Initial Team Meetings ###

**Quantitative Datae**
- Latency / Time to Login
   - Device Type Preference
   - Mobile vs. desktop
- Which pages see the most auths
   - Where are people initiating logins from?
- True return % (maybe)

**Qualitative Data**
- User Intervention Required Errors
   - Report on how often users receive sign in error cannot be resolved with a self service solution, requiring the user to call the help desk or fill out a ticket.
     - An example of these types of errors are ones where a user has multiple active corp ids from the MPI response. MPI is the user information source of truth. They give us all the user attributes we need to determine if a user should be able to access something on va.gov. If MPI responds back to us with multiple active corp ids, we cannot allow the user to login to va.gov. The reason for this is that we have forms on va.gov that expect only one corp id to be present. If we allow the user object to contain two values then the form submission may get messed up downstream.
     - These types of errors have been called “catastrophic errors” in other circles. These types of errors require that a person call the help desk or fill out ticket in order to have something manually edited by a human to allow them to login to va.gov
- Satisfaction/trust rating
- Feedback from users on whether they're able to do what they wanted


### Other things we might want to measure in the future ###

- SAML vs Oauth success metrics
- Downtime per CSP
- MAP STS token requests
  - By Application
  - Success rate
- Terms of Use Accept/Decline
  - How many users accept ToU
    - How many users decline ToU
    - Error Rates
- Percentage of Users Successfully Signing In Using Assistive Technologies
  - Demonstrates the team's commitment to inclusive design for veterans with disabilities.
- Decrease in Password Reset Requests
  - Indicates a more secure and reliable authentication process, reducing user frustration.

### In addition ###
- Conduct regular security assessments and testing
  - Agencies should regularly assess the risk to websites and provide commensurate security testing of those sites based on that assessment. The assessment should consider the potential impact of a security incident on vital transactions or core services provided to the public, access to timely information, government and vital external operations, and public trust. 
  - Agencies should perform manual penetration testing, where appropriate, based on threat analysis and the criticality of the underlying system.

## Use Cases:
* As a VA leader, I would like the Identity team to present me with the authentication data that is most useful to me, so I may understand and report upon how Veterans are logging into VA.gov.
* As a VA Leader, I want the user authentication data produced by the Identity Team to be instantly understandable and not open to misinterpretation so that I may properly report on how Veterans login to VA.gov.


## Assumptions:
* There are common pieces of user authentication data that VA Leadership is continually wanting to view.
* Could use a survey result page like this to

## Solution Approach: 
* Make sure we are on the same page with our VA partners on what data they are looking for.
* Do research around industry standards for reporting & displaying user data.
* Build out the data dashboard, making sure that it's simple and easily interpreted.
