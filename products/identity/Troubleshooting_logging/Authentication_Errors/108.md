[h1] We can't sign you in

[va-alert]

We’re having trouble signing you in with your My Healthevet account right now because the services you are requesting require you to have a Premium My Healthevet account.

Read below to learn how to upgrade to a Premium My HealtheVet account online or in person if you’re a VA patient.

Follow these 2 steps to get a Premium My HealtheVet account online.

[h3] Sign up for a Premium account in person

You can get a Premium My HealtheVet account in person at a VA health facility if you’re a VA patient. You’ll need to bring this form and ID with you:

- **A completed and signed Individuals’ Request for a Copy of Their Own Health Information (VA Form 10-5345a).** This “VA release of information” form gives us permission to share an electronic copy of your health record with your online account. You can download a PDF copy of the form now, call ahead to ask the staff to mail you a form, or ask for a form when you get there.Get VA Form 10-5345a to downloadFind the phone number for your nearest VA health care facility
- **A government-issued photo ID**. This can be either your Veteran Health Identification Card or a valid driver’s license.

A VA staff member will verify your identity. Then they’ll record your information in the My HealtheVet system and confirm you’re eligible for a Premium account. A copy of your VA Form 10-5345a-MHV will be added to your VA medical record, and the original paper copy will be shredded to protect your privacy.

Note: When you open or download a PDF file, you create a temporary file on your computer. Other people may be able to see this file—and any personal health information you fill in—especially if you’re using a public or shared computer.

If you’ve taken the steps above and still can’t sign in, please call our MyVA411 main information line for help at 800-698-2411 (TTY:711).
