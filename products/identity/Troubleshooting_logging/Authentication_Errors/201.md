## Title
Generic OAuth Errors

## Why it happens
This is a catch-all for OAuth (Sign-in Service) authentication errors. Sometimes we are not sure why the error occurs OR we don't want to display the error to the user in certain cases like identity theft flag, date of death, etc.

## How to resolve the issue

1. Ask the user to clear cookies & cache in their browser
2. Ask the user to sign in again with their credential provider
