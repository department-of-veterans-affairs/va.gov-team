# Multiple MHV IDs

## Error code
`101`

## Title
Multiple MHV IDs / Multiple IENs

## URL
https://dev.va.gov/auth/login/callback/?auth=fail&code=101

## Why it happens
This error occurs when a user signs in with their My HealtheVet credential and there are multiple IDs associated with their account.  This is only an issue on VA.gov and not the My HealtheVet website.  VA.gov's API is unable to compare which MHV ID is the most recent/active ID and is unable to perform lookups against multiple IDs at the same time.

## How to resolve the issue

1. Create a ticket with the help desk
