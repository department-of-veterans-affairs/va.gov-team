* Message to my doctor’s office (on homepage looking for message my doctor)
* I wouldn’t know how to do that
* Oh manage okay this is all the stuff that doesn’t apply to me
* I don’t have VA health stuff 
* Message your healthcare team would be a doctor
* Verify page this is something I thought we already did (verify page)
* We already verified with the website with the ID.me thing and it’s asking me to verify again
* Stupid 
* Very dumb 
* Okay I mean this doesn’t make any sense to me
* This should be a direct thing
* We went to manage benefits 
* This shouldn’t be a thing this screen shouldn’t be here
* Why does vets.gov verify identity it says it a one time process but we just did that 
* This isn’t a trouble thing I already did it when signing in
* Why do I need to do it twice
* We will make sure you are you 5 billion times okay (reading faq)
* This is great and I have no problems but why do I have to have a second screen saying all these things (verify page)
* Once you sign in if I remember correctly from id.me it was lengthy just to get that and then for the code and pin then I’m already doing it so why do I have to do it again 
* We already did the vetting process
* (Goes to 2fa question)—okay that’s great extra layer of security 
* Where do we need to go now
* Covered all the bases for providing information now it’s just an execution issue because we have to verify identity again
* How many layers do we need?
* I’ve used this before to get id.me 
* Wants me to do this again so it’s annoying
* It’s a dot gov so I’m already supposed to be trusting it’s a gov website so I’m registering myself with the government which is okay or supposed to be okay (identity proofing)
* No single governing force or website behind it so I’m hooked and hoping I can use this to get my education benefits 
* I’m all about the Vets.gov site 
* If I had to do all this I would do it 
* Don’t care about it if they want to take my identity they can pay my bills I’m just trying to get to the solution with what I want to do with my life so I have and problems and if I really cared I could read these 5 pages 
* Credit profile oh hey look at that—Sean you want to help out here – (identity proofing)
* I think there is potential for having wrong information and get mixed up in this whole thing so I imagine the credit step or address is needed 
* No misgivings about it
* Okay these are fine [when viewing attributes shared]
* This is kind of a weird step I don’t care and will do it and this needs my permission but what happens if I deny  (consent screen)
* I have no clue can we find out
* [We've verified your identity. "Allow and continue" or "Deny"]
  * What would happen if you hit allow and continue?
    * **It says we've verified your identity, so this is interesting. This is a weird step. I don't care about it personally because I'm going to do it, but it says we need your permission: "allow and continue" or "deny". So what happens if I deny? Like I can't use this anymore? **
    * What do you think would happen (if you denied)?
      * **I have no clue. Can we find out?**
      * **[clicks "deny"] laughs. [sees "we couldn't verify your identity through the account you used to sign in."] So this is kind of like an old school video game where you have to keep answering the questions where it loops you through the one path you can do. I feel like I'm in a role playing game where it's like, "go through this thing again".**
      * If you didn't go through it again and you wanted to go back to a different part of the site, what do you think would happen if you wanted to access your education benefits? 
        * **I feel like it would ask me the same question again ("allow and continue" or "deny"). At some point in time, I don't have a problem sharing my identity with Vets.gov because that's the fix for my issues or my need for this program, but the only choice you have is to go verify.**
* If I went through it again it would ask me the same question 
* I don’t have a problem sharing with vets.gov cause I’m hoping that would fix my issues or needs for the program but it’s the only choice 
* Allow and continue yay cause we have to 
* Whatever it takes to not have to re-verify every time I get on this website 
* I hope it’s just one time
* People like to be thorough and to get the warm fuzzy that people are doing this for a reason 
* (Reads the t&c)
* Perfect this is what I wanted
* Ah thank you 
* Right off the bat the issue is that the old school veterans who have nothing but paper and if you loose it so this prevents it
* For me enough we need a central hub Vet cloud if you were it needs to be like this
* Guess this is what we need to do clicks yes
* This is interesting so SM will be reviewed by healthcare team  (SM screen)
* This is for someone getting VA medical stuff
* So this doesn’t relate to me 
* One stop shop
* Who and where is this healthcare team
* Home depot has it where you can use your location and says the nearest home depot is here or that you prefer home depot
* Shouldn’t there be something like that here with my local hospital 
* Should already have a reference of who the doctor is 
* Couldn’t read the whole t&c so I don’t know 
* Use my info for the benefit of something 
* If you already have a FB account this is a drop in the bucket
* I’m okay with it because I don’t know what else the government would be using my information for and they have already had it before
* Depends on the site for if I read t&c like google.com and I have my gmail and a google thing click on yes and will you allow google to do it I would allow because I already have a dependency on it I’m a google dude not apple I would naturally think it’s okay
* But if it’s on like some newspaper thing no I would be more hesitant 
* I’m all about having my info in one spot
* I don’t like to look all over for it
* Accepting t&c it would surprise me if there wasn’t one that I had to agree too
* Fake website if I didn’t see it
* I was totally expecting it
* It’s requesting my info and what I agree to
* If I’m on my one computer which I’m on—I don’t mind that one step for that one time but if we have to keep doing it it’s stupid
* Already signed in with ID.me and then go verify—that’s the step
* As long as this is one time I’m okay with it—it’s stupid but if it’s one time for the one computer then no big deal 
* It would be worth it because this is tied into IP address and we already did the id.me thing so if I wanted to access this and this is the only thing I would have to do ever I wouldn’t hate it as long as I’m done with it
