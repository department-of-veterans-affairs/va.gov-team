Participant 7

The participant was actually the Veteran and his wife, who helps him navigate many Wedsites.

Background:

He has not used vets.gov.
He does not use any other websites to manage VA Benefits
Instead manages his accounts by phone
The benefits he uses are medical, VHA, and he recieves disability benefits
He does not have a MHV account.

The participant was unable to get access to use the keyboard and mouse and therefore the researchers handle mavigation with instructions from the participant 

Task #1

P7's wife helped with navigation and shortly into the session became the main person navigating the site with some input from P7. 

Went to the sign-in page and read the pages. When asked why was on the page. He stated "Why do I have to sign-in" and expressed confusion of why he was being asked to sign in. 

P7 was confused by the page and was unsure if he had an account. 
The wife said he did not. He then stated that my wife usually helps me with these things. 

The wife review the page and read the information on the page and state that seeing that he didn't have an account 
He would click on the create an account link. 
She said she would complete that create account information. 

When the secure your account page appeared, the wife read the page to the participant. 
Stating "No would not do that" and asked how do I select no. 

When asked why they would not select extra security, she said, "One (layer of security) is enough. The bank doesn't ask for two. I don't think the VA should."
She said she would probably quite at this point. 
However, she said if she had to choose she would select by text or phone. 
She then read the texting instruction and said that they won't be able to do text becuase they don't have a phone that can do that. Thus, the would verify by phone. 

Task #2

When research said the next task was to send a secure message to there doctor, she said we would like to do that.. 

She read the verify identity text and said she would expect to click the Verify with id.me button and to walk away for 5-10 minutes. She expected the verification process to be automatic 
She did not that she normally does not use Chrome and rather uses IE

When ask why she was seeing the verify my id page she stated "I already have double id check on the prior step" and she stated that the process seems redundant. In fact she said it was "redundancy on top of redundancy"

When taken to the FAQs form the Why vets.gov is identify you? link
She siad the information was helpful but it still didn't tell her why she had to do it twice.
She also stated she didn't know how vets.gov would id her husband. She state, after reading the system cpmpare data from the Veteran, "What does it compare it to"
She read that they could verify by phone and she said she would do it that way.

After entering the getting to the verify page, she stated they would use the driver's license to verify. 
They were then taken to the verify with questions pages and what they were expected to provide. 
She said probably Last 4 of the SSN, would ne a second for of id. 
She navigated through the follow information pages. 

When she got to the verification questions, she recognized the information was optained via the credit berueas. 
she said she was surprised by the questions. 

On the T&C pages she stated, "when I see these I just go to the end and agree". When asked why, she said "If I don't I can't use the service"
She also said she never reads them
When asked what she was giving access to she said "Access to all of [her husband's] health records"

When she came to the Secure Messaging page, she exclaimed that they wouldn't go through all that just to send a message to the doctor. She said her husband only see the doctor twice a year and she didn't feel it was worth it. 

She wasn't surprised by the process, but if she was going to do it she said "it better only happen once" 
She expect the verification process to only have to be done once.
