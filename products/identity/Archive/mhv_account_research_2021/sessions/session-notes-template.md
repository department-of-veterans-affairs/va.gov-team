    - Was that what you expected? Why or why not?
    
***Next section is ONLY for participants with MHV account***
* When you accepted the terms and conditions, we gave you to access to all the health tools on Vets.gov. We also upgraded your MHV account to Premium, which means you now have access to all the health tools on MHV (download health records and message your doctor).
    - Was that what you expected? Why or why not?
* When you went through this process we didn't explain to you that your MHV account would be upgraded, what do you think about that? (probe to see if doing it w/o their knowledge is disconcerting).
  * If disconcerting: 
    - What could we have done to make that more clear on the terms and conditions? 
    - What info would you want to know in the beginning? 
    - If we explained that in the beginning, would you be more likely to complete the process?
* Now that you know your MHV account has been upgraded, what would you expect to see when you go to MHV next time? 
    - Would anything be different?
    - Is a Premium account of interest/worthwhile to you? 
    - What do you think you would do on MHV if your account was upgraded to Premium?
