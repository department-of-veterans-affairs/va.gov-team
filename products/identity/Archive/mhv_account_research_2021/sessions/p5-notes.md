- If I've used Vets.gov its been a long time, I don't remember
- Doesn't use any VA online tools 
- Gets notices for my regional office once in a while and I signed up a long time ago but it's been at least 5-6 years so I've been inactive

#### on Secure Your Account
- [He's reading it...]
- I don't do texting I'm an old geezer
- I don't do texting, I would do phone call (under text code)

#### on Verify yr identity
- I guess I'm verifying my ID
- Drivers license... holy crap oh my goodness. That's convenient, I like that or passport is pretty cool.

#### on Enter yr hone number
- Would have clicked home phone

### on info correct
- Yes

#### on We've verified yr identity
- Permission to share blah blah blah

#### on Terms and Conditions
- This is all just legal jargon and everybody just clicks yes.

"Is that what you usually do?"
- Yes nobody ever reads it do they
- I mean if you want to use the tools or the service everybody clicks yes

"Why do you think you're seeing this page?""
- I'll got to read it. I suppose I'm agreeing to the sharing of information. but I'm just asassuming that. 

"What kind of info?"
- Well I assume it's health info, prescription records and my health care team. But honestly nobody reads it.

"What happens next after agreeing?""
- Well I would. Assume we're in a, how do I put this. I'm now in a silo and I'm just going to the next step to get through to wherever I'm going.

"You started with the goal of being able to view a message of sending a message. Were you expecting to see this as part of that process?"
- Well you know, I would say that this is legalese to go through to get to the next step. Yes expected but it's just a nuisance. But you have to go through it if you want to continue to use the vets.gov. If I stopped right here I would lose all the benefits of the website. Even if I only want to use 20% of the site, I still have to do this to get that.
- It's like signing a contract to buy a house. 55 pages of signing your initials, you gotta get it done.
- I'm a little pessimistic on these things...
- nothing surprising. This is stuff you have to go through with just about anything. Agree to this and that. I guess I would prefer it if once you're in the system, you don't have to to do any of that. But we have to do these up grunt things first.
- Ii wouldn't come back tomorrow and expect to see this.

"Anything easy to complete?"
- All relatively easy. I don't see anything difficult there.

"Anything difficult?"
- Not really.

"In the future, would you go through this effort to message your doctor?"
- If I had a real concern I would do that. 

"Any other reasons you'd go through the process to use our site?""
- If I had questions. I haven't worked in health care myself. I know how busy docs and nurses, I would hate to ask stupid questions. Sometimes I don't want to inconvenience professionals. so I would be hesitant to ask frivolous questions. I don't know how you filter that. As a consumer of a health service, I would ask my stupid questions but I wouldn't want to inundate the VA with that.

"Other health tools used in past?"
- My health provider, I can access past visits, prescriptions, future appointments, lab results, so I'm fully with that. But that's my health care provider right here in town. I wouldn't use the VA for, cause I'm with this med facility right here. Would use VA for something for classes and stuff.
- Once in there, you have access to everything. Security and confidentiality and HIPPA, you have access to your records and appointments and all that stuff.

"Do you have that with the clinic you use?"
- Yes
