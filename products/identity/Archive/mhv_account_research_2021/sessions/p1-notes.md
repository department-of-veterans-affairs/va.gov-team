# PARTICIPANT 1

### Information
* Has used vets.gov before
* Has also used eBenefits and Rx
* Has not used mobile apps


* If I recall, I needed to id hard to login and follow the screens an one prompted the other to open

* It took a good ten minutes before it was all setup

* When you first go in and register you have to put your information but anywhere from 5-8 minutes at the most I think is more ideal. [What is ideal time?]

* I do have an MHV account

* I setup appointments with doctors, I message my doctor.

* I have downloaded records


### Task

* I would sign in first based on this screen. 

* I would click on the id.me screen

* I would put my email and password and that would get me in

* This screen here sends a code to my phone and as a text and then put in the code number and click continue

* This was just asking me where I want the text sent so this is the screen with the code. 

* [Presses continue] which would show me that I'm logged in because of my name at the top. 

* From this screen I would go into manage your health and benefits. 

* Then I would select message your health care team. 

* And I guess it's asking me once again to verify my identity which I thought is redundant which I thought I just did but it's asking me to id. 

* When I had done it I remember going through various screens and I thought I did that.  It's a layer for security but once I was brought in already and identified myself and sent code I thought that would be suffice. 

* It's troublesome-I want to talk to my health provider and send a message I have other things to do.  

* So it's a onetime thing.  [After mike explains a bit]

* The first thing that comes to my mind is that they want to make sure you are the vet-it's a government website and I imagine they are taking precautions and that it is the person they want to talk to it is who-they want to identify me. 

* More thorough explanation of why they are asking this info-I think it's good-I'm not sure I had that I guess I did have that but this is more thorough. 

* As I'm looking at all the categories I'm reading-okay so yeah it says this is a one time deal and once you do it you don't have to do it over and over and that is good to know. 

* [reads] Need a smartphone and proof of ID-yeah this is helpful. 

* I wouldn't read everything to be honest but this is helpful

* [in your own words why do you need to verify your identity] it's high importance with a gov website-lot of information, socials, dob, so that's why they are taking these steps to make sure it's the person that's supposed to be doing this.

* 1:16 time stamp (still on faqs) 

* Looking for where I can click to continue or go back

* Wasn't clear if you are still signed in or not 

* I would start all over again I would repeat the process  

* [Starts verifying identity ]

* Reads top of page

* [What would you expect to have to do?]  Giving me options for if I want to use drivers license or questions that you should know or verify using passport-three options

* It looks like it would be faster if I do questions

* I would click on answering questions

* [Goes through the rest of the flow entering address and phone number and social]

* Takes me to phone screen to enter number-I would use my phone, no home phone clicks submit 

* [Verifying if that is correct-clicks check box and verify]

* [Now on KBA section]

* Now it would ask me questions about stuff that I'm the only one that should know like mortgage and I would def know what mortgage it would be

* Asking me more stuff, personal stuff, financial information here and then I would definitely answer those questions. 

* Says we've verified your identity and reads the rest of the attribute page. 

* Okay um seems like a lot of information but I'd be okay with it.  

* Now I'm at the disclaimer.  It's trying to protect the info that is going to be used for this is more like for their safety and mine.  How is this info going to be used and if I agree with what is displayed. 

* I would click yes.

* Doesn't try to scroll.  Oh it's telling me to scroll then I can click yes-I guess it wants me to read the whole thing before I click.  

* Finally what I wanted to do-talk to my healthcare team.

* Shows me what I have in my inbox. Here I can compose a message to doctor. 

* [What did you just go through with the steps?]

* I had to register first to get all the info, which takes a little bit of time.  Several layers to identify me-making sure I was the veteran that needed to get onto this so not only did I register I went through layers of identity.  Given a page to read conditions of purpose of why they are doing this and what it will be used for and then I got to the main message to message healthcare team. 

* [Timestamp 1:25]

* I was expecting-I wouldn't want to give my information to someone else it's dealing with personal stuff so I see why it's being done this way because it's important.  

* Do I expect it to be this long, probably not but that's just me but I understand it.  It's a benefit at the end it's worth it. 

* A little time consuming but I understand why. 

* It's a lot of information you just have to look for it-I would look for manage healthcare and click on that and get to my doctor 

* It's easy once it's all setup and convenient-you can do it from your desktop at work or at lunch and you can do it quickly-the convenience of it if you need to setup an appointment or refill-once you setup the regular process it's worth it. Once you do it it's well worth it. 

* I would do this on my own. 

* [What surprises?]

* I wouldn't say surprised but maybe how one can capture all the info and how it's being used and how it's setup-before you had to go to VA which is tiresome-this is more direct access so I guess I'm surprised that it's setup and convenient. 

* [When you setup mhv] 

* Similar to what I just did you fill out information-I do remember answering questions to verify identity so yeah very similar. 

* Didn't have to go in person. 

* Has a premium account. 

* [Does he read T&Cs]
* I typically don't read but just glance.
