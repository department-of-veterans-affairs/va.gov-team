Participant Two: 

### Background
* Has used Vets.gov 
* Premium account-use for appointments, rx, SM with doctors on MHV
* Creating an account on MHV was initially I had to go to two different sites but I think I got into it pretty early-it wasn't much or difficult-I work with computers so talking to other vets a lot had difficulty and aren't used to computers. 
* I didn't have much difficulty. 
* I went to the class and took that so it wasn't hard but there were a lot of changes as they were adjusting. 
* The first person I went to wasn't really trained and I think I knew more than her and she couldn't get me up on the account so I went to another session at a different VA in Mass. 
* Took about two days to create account. 
* Vets.gov is similar to MHV, are you competing each other or one tagging into each other.  Will Vets.gov give me access to other stuff?
* I also have an eBenefits account. 

### Task
* goes to manage your health and benefits
* signs in with MHV
* [on sign in/up screen]
  * I will read this because I'm new-looks at the right side of the sign in screen

* [on connecting mhv>vets screen]
  * I'm going from Vets.gov to MHV [email page]
  * I'm trying to get into MHV 
  * Clicks on the circle icons like the lock 
  * [mike tells him to click email address field]

* [secure your account screen]
  * I wouldn't go to secure my account I would go back
  * I don't text message or phone call 
  * It would help if I put my glasses on too
  * This is asking me to reauthorize right?
  * I'm not clear what they are asking me here, They are asking me to setup to different ID accounts or verification? Asking me to set up 2 diffrent id accounts for verification.  
  * So in other words, I can't go directly, I have to setup an id account for vets.gov and mhv in order to use this?
  * I feel like your asking me in order to use it I have to have an account with mhv and vets.gov and then I can use both to connect back and forth 

* [enter code screen]  
  * I'm setting up a digital code that they will contact me with to allow me into vets.gov
  * 2-factor authentication [what does that mean to you] I have to give a number or an address or id card two different items to get into the system 
  * [reads out loud] your account is now secure-so that means for me to get into vets.gov I would receive a text stating here is your code-okay. 
  * They want to ID me with my vets.gov code
  * My first question-with id.me so this is going to setup my identity process with Vets.gov 
  * I'd hit that button
  * I would have to do next because I'm not sure I think the number I gave them is my identity but I'm not sure so I would go to get answers [FAQs]

* [FAQs screen]  
  * First one I would go to is how do I sign into vets.gov 
  * Oh so I can use mhv or ds logon 
  * So I can use mhv sign in to get into vets.gov?
  * I would prefer not to create more ID information 
  * I guess this does answer my questions cause I can sign in with mhv 
  * I can't find my mhv login, it's on my phone 
  * Would I hit mhv here [tries the bold word in FAQs] 
  * I would go to sign in now and lets see where that takes me
  * Lets see if it picks it up automatically 
  * Mike a question I would have, if I want to use vets.gov for other things so I would ask should I get an account through ID.me should I trust them? If I went with MHV I could log in with MHV with my ID.
  * It says I can do that as I re-read that. 
  * I can accomplish what I want just by giving my mhv login 
  * Don't have to use the id.me. 
  * I would because I know a lot of guys my age they don't like a lot of id information to get into accounts it becomes cumbersome and what I would do is make it more prominent-you can use MHV-and ds logon but sometimes ds logon gets screwed up so I would make mhv prominent and would imagine a significant number of people use MHV compared to the other two
  * I would have hit healthcare on the verify page-looking for a process on how to get to sm. 
  * The other one requests records on SM. In MHV SM is all under that umbrella. I would go to manage your health and benefits and the mhv homepage, which describes more about the products. 
  * Well I think it would be under why does vets.gov verify identity.
  * [Goes to FAQs to look for more info about SM, BB, Rx]
  * I think anybody that comes here and looks at this why should I trust vets.gov-why do I need to verify my identity 
  * Anybody that wants to do that knows why 
  * Military understand security so those two questions are redundant [section of faq about privacy]
  * I don't think they should be the first two questions [why should I trust and why do I need to verify]
  * First two should be -what information does ID.me collect and do they share it with anyone else that's kinda why should I trust them
  * And 6 digit code should be there
  * If I see these I would say you think I'm stupid?
  * I understand why you have to do some of it
  * You don't ask someone-my view is you don't ask someone that you are going to use and say why should I trust you. I would have looked you up before i got on vets gov to be sure i could trust you. I would expect you to give me all the good reasons and none of the bad
  * I would list what Vets.gov allows you and what it let's you into with one id
  * That's a major selling point
  * What I've seen initially I had to have a couple of IDs but if you made that clear upfront 
  * One ID to access all of this-that is huge
  * A lot of guys arent real happy about identifying themselves online. They would like to, but some physically cant. i think a lot of guys still beleive I want to talk to someone to give them my private info. Not for me, i'm ok with computers.
  * A lot of questions you're asking, I dont think vets would go to vetsgov if they didnt trust the site, you know?

* [choose method for verification screen]
  * would verify by answering questions.
  * I wouldnt put in a home phone, dont need to (on verify phone page)

* [terms and conditions screen]
  * [mike asks about the process he just went through]
  * it was excellent, pretty stratight forward. you asked enough questions to legitimize that it's secure.
  * he didn't scroll or read the t&cs.

* [secure messaging screen]
  * so it just has my recorded health team, so thats ok. mhv has the same thing.
  * [mike asks: if you wanted to get to secure messaging on mhv later, what would you expect to do later to access on mhv?]
  * on mhv they have a list. I would find my provider I want to message. and I would send a message to that provider. They have a search box of people.
  * [mike eplains in the background - we would have upgraded your account to access secure messaging through the steps you went through. but we didnt really explain it or make it explicit. how much do you want to know about the background?]
  * I get doctors notes, appointments, secure messaging, lab reports. It's great to pull in. Is that what you're talknig about?
  * I would want to know they have access to all the information they want and I have the top level access and I would do whatever I needed to get that.

### Followup questions
1. if you didnt have premium account, going through this process, thoughts on whether it was worthwhile to access secure messaging?
  * I think its very valuable. If I didn't have to go to mhv or ebenefits, to different places, If it was the VA site itself, that's a plus. The fact that i can get into all of those with basically one id. that would be enormous. 

2. Was it [the whole process\] orthwhile?
  * Yes very worthwhile. I have a spinal injury so I deal with the VA a lot. So being able to do it on one site is huge. Absolutely huge. And my question: I'm not sure if this is just a case of beauracy. We've got 2 different groups doing the same thing. Is vetsgov gonna take over ebn mhv etc?

* if you could ever do that, go into one site with one id, instead of going back and forth, that would be outstanding.
