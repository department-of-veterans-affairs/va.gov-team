This folder should not be used as a dumping ground for useless documentation. Anything added to this folder must have a purpose and that purpose should be documented within this readme.

# Archive Folder
Documents which provide historical context for the current Identity Team supported services. 

## Cookie Tracer
These documents demonstrate how to use AWS cloudwatch logs to find logs for the Identity teams SAML transactions. The SAML transaction logs listed in these documents stopped being sent to AWS Cloudwatch in October of 2021. After October 2021 all the logs go to Grafana Loki. If you need to search for logs prior to October 2021, then the documents in this folder will be helpful. The other reason for keeping these documents is to show the historical context of why we delayed the release of SSOe for VA.gov which could serve future iterations of production enhancements regarding sign in to VA.gov.

## Sentry Hackathon
This folder contains a lot of good documentation around the research we conducted with our sentry errors. The documents in here provide more in depth historical information as to why sentry is setup the way it is and the lessons we have learned along the way.
