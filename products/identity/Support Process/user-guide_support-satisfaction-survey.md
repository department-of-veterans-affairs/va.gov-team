## Purpose

This initiative covers the FY2024 objective to empower VA.gov product teams, specifically the key results of developing a 
request and support process for VA.gov product teams, establishing and publishing monthly metrics around response times 
for said teams, and establishing and maintaining a support satisfaction rating of 70% or higher for VA.gov product team 
support.

The Support Satisfaction Survey is the tool used for assessing the quality of support provided by our team. 

Understanding customer satisfaction is crucial for continuous improvement.

## Analyzing Data


### Q1. *Rate your satisfaction with the support provided by our team.*

This question serves as the foundation for measuring client satisfaction. It provides an overall view of how well our team is meeting user expectations. 

*The goal is to maintain a CSAT score above 70.*

Analysis:

- Calculate the CSAT (Customer Satisfaction) Score:

  -  Assign numerical values to the satisfaction response options
       -  Very Satisfied = 5
       -  Satisfied = 4
       -  Neither Satisfied Nor Dissatisfied = 3
       -  Dissatisfied = 2
       -  Very Dissatisfied = 1
    
    - Add the number of satisfied customers (those who rated us a 4 or 5)
    - Divide by the total number of responses
    - For example, if 62 of 100 responses have a rating of 4 or 5, your score would be 62.
  
    - In Excel:
         - Input Total Responses: Enter the total number of survey responses in cell A1.
         - Enter Satisfied Responses: Input the number of positive (satisfied) responses in cell A2.
         - Apply CSAT Formula: Use the formula =`(A2/A1)*100` in cell A3 to calculate the CSAT score as a percentage.

Graphing:

- Create a bar chart or pie chart showing the distribution of responses.
- Highlight the percentage of Very Satisfied and Satisfied responses.
- In the Domo Dashboard, this graph will update automatically upon importing the survey file.


### Q2. *Add a comment about the quality of service you received.*

This open-ended question allows users to provide specific feedback. It captures qualitative insights beyond numerical ratings.

Analysis:

- Categorize comments into themes (e.g., responsiveness, knowledge, friendliness).
- Identify recurring issues or positive aspects.
- Use sentiment analysis methods to gauge overall sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).


### Q3. *If you answered anything other than Very Satisfied, what could our team do to make your experience one that warrants a Very Satisfied response?*

This question helps uncover areas for improvement. It encourages users to suggest actionable changes.

Analysis:

- Group responses into categories (e.g., process improvement, faster resolution times, better communication).
- Prioritize based on frequency and impact.
- Use a Pareto analysis (80:20 rule) to highlight the most common improvement areas.

### Q4. *Is there any additional feedback you would like to share?* 

 - Possible Topics:
     - Your overall experience
     - The product you used with our team
     - Our troubleshooting guide
     - The Identity Slackbot

This open-ended question allows users to express additional thoughts or concerns.

Analysis:

- Similar to Question 2, categorize feedback and identify patterns.
- Look for insights that may not fit neatly into other questions.

Graphing:

- No specific graphs but consider including verbatim quotes in the report.
  
- Your overall experience: Assess the holistic experience beyond support interactions.
- The product you used with our team: Understand how product functionality impacts satisfaction.
- Our troubleshooting guide: Evaluate the effectiveness of self-help resources.
- The Identity Slackbot: Gather feedback on specific tools or channels.

### Q5. *If we may contact you to learn more about your experience, please enter your email here. (Optional)*

This question allows users to volunteer for follow-up discussions.

- Collect email addresses for further investigation.
- Use this information to reach out to users with specific issues.

Analysis: 

- Track the number of users willing to be contacted.
- Are there any correlations with satisfaction?

------------------

## Using Spreadsheets for Qualitative Analysis  

1. Understanding the Data

- There are several columns in the spreadsheet (Columns A - T) representing additional pieces of data collected alongside the Support Satisfaction survey questions.
- Quantitative data (Column P) will be analyzed using the CSAT formula.
- Qualitative data (Columns Q, R, S) responses will require more attention.
  
2. Cleaning, Organizing, Coding, and Categorization of Data

- Read through each qualitative response (Columns Q, R, S).
- Remove any irrelevant or duplicate responses.
- Create a new column where you’ll summarize or categorize qualitative answers.
- Identify common themes or recurring phrases.
- Create codes or categories to group similar responses together (e.g., “Product Issues,” “Communication,” “Suggestions”).

3. Create a Summary Table
- In a separate sheet within the same file, create a summary table.
- List your codes or categories in one column.
- In the adjacent column, summarize the key points from the qualitative responses related to each code.
- To provide context and support your findings, look for representative quotes.

4. Thematic Analysis

- Extract meaningful insights from the qualitative responses.
- Dive deeper into each code or category by looking for patterns, outliers, and unexpected findings.

5. Quantitative Metrics

- Calculate the CSAT score.
    - Add the number of responses with a “Very satisfied” or “Satisfied” rating. 
    - Divide this number by the total number of responses. 
- Use pie charts to visualize this metric each month.
- Use bar graphs to visualize the score over several months.


6. Recommendations and Action Items

- Compile your findings into a monthly Support Satisfaction report.
- Show the CSAT score for the month, numerically and graphically.
- Use the qualitative categories and themes as discussion points for what went well and areas for improvement.
- Propose actionable recommendations based on your qualitative analysis by considering short-term fixes and long-term improvements.
- Highlight areas where the team can enhance the support experience.
    - Provide context through the use of quotes from survey takers.
- Include visualizations for quantitative data and qualitative excerpts.
