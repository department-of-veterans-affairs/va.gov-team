# **Resources for identity and VA.gov authentication support**

**Who we are**

The OCTO Identity team manages the authentication integration for VA.gov. We work with identity partners to confirm who’s signing in and provide secure access to VA.gov resources. Our team understands how identity and security works across the entire platform.

**How we can help**

We help teams set up and monitor a secure signed in experience for VA.gov applications and services. Schedule [flexible office hours or engineering pairing sessions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Support%20Process/identity-office-hours.md) with us to collaborate anytime.

## **Recommended troubleshooting steps**

- Search [#vsp-identity](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/CSFV4QTKN/p1713293899320349) for keywords in your issue to see if it’s come up before.
- Confirm [vets-api and mock data is up to date](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/CSFV4QTKN/p1713297530249979?thread_ts=1713293899.320349&cid=CSFV4QTKN).
- Clear your cache and cookies, as this can solve a lot of common issues.

## **Terminology**

### **Active concepts**

- **Identity and Access Management ([IAM](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/sites/OITEPMOIAM/playbooks/Pages/IAM%20Playbook%20Home.aspx)):** a process to vet users and manage digital identities, and a set of capabilities that support authentication and authorization of user access for VA applications.
- **Integration Control Number (ICN):** this is used as a [primary identifier](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/470b2ba8c4c6c1b7cf168737755ce2607fc92954/products/identity/Products/Design%20Documents/UserAccount_Creation_Flow.md) for MPI queries. Only verified users will have an ICN.
- **Level of Assurance (LOA):** guarantees that the user initiating the request is correlated to the identifying information within the User object. There are 4 possible [Levels of Assurance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/authentication#Authentication-LevelsofAssurance) provided based on the mechanism by which the user authenticated.
- **Master Persons Index (MPI):** contains a [comprehensive record for a VA-affiliated individual](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/mvi) (not always a Veteran) and links their identity across systems. Formerly known as the Master Veteran Index (MVI).
- **Sign-in Service (SiS):** a client service that authenticates login credentials, and grants access to vets-api resources.
- **Unified Sign-in Page (USiP):** a web-based application on [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) used to authenticate and redirect to external applications.
- **Universally Unique Identifier (UUID):** a 36-character alphanumeric string that can be used to identify information. All [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) users have a UUID.

### **Deprecated concepts**

- **Enterprise Military Information Service (EMIS):** contains information on a veteran's service record from the military. Note that EMIS is now decommissioned, and that data should be coming from VA Profile.
- **Master Veterans Index (MVI):** deprecated term for Master Persons Index (MPI). Changed because individuals logging in and accessing [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) are not always Veterans.
