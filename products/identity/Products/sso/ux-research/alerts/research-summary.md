# VA.gov Manage Benefit Pages - Updates to Alert Boxes
### Research conducted by Ad Hoc for the SSO Project

## Background
- In late February 2020 (2/21, 2/24, 2/25) we performed a UX review of 3 different design options for how to update Alert boxes to link to both My HealtheVet and My VA Health (Cerner). 
- We conducted 45-minute long interviews with 6 Veterans using an Invision prototype. 
- Findings will be translated into a consolidated design direction, which is being translated into wireframes for development by SSO team, with content support from the VSP Content team.

## Goal
We wanted to test 3 different design directions to determine what design Veterans found clearest and easiest to comprehend.
 
## Research questions
- Do our screens enable participants to comprehend the arrival of My VA Health?
- What, if anything, do participants find unclear?
- What questions or feedback do participants have about My VA Health?
- Does one direction facilitate comprehension more than the others? Why?
 
## Method
- Remote, moderated feedback session and comprehension testing and a series of medium-fidelity, static screens housed within a single Invision prototype.
- We used the Perigean Zoom account, and used the Chat functionality to send direct links to participants. We asked them to share their screen.
- We had 6 participants, 5 men and 1 women. Participants live across the United States.
- We alternated order of directions to avoid order bias and ensure participants' comprehension of one direction wasn't predicated on another direction.

## Insights & Recommendations

*Design directions for reference*

##### Direction 1

## Overall, participants preferred Direction 2
We asked participants about their initial preference after quickly seeing all design directions, and then again at the end of the interview after discussing the designs in more detail. 4/6 participants clearly identified direction 2 as preferred. 1 participant described direction 2 as preferred, yet didn't clearly identify it as his preferred direction. 1 participant identified direction 3 as preferred. No participants preferred direction 1.

When asked why direction 2 was preferred, participants consistently pointed out the following reasons: 
1. CTAs were stacked on top of each other, putting both options in the bounding box of their screen, and allowing participants to easily choose between them. This was most consistently mentioned as the top benefit. 
2. CTA headlines included the VAMC name, allowing them to quickly identify where to go based on desired facility rather than tool name.
3. Yellow warning alert box style (see next theme).

#### Quotes
* _"[Direction 2] seems to be the most user friendly, and the least amount of movement and navigation to know what to click on."_

* _"All the options are built into one - it's a one stop shop...I prefer where it is all in one section rather than having two different slides. It's not going out of my way having to scroll, but if it' in one section that’s better."_

* _"It's right there in front of me - [direction 2] is a 5/5 for me"_

* _"[I prefer direction 2] - seems to be the most obvious one. Hits you in the face and you can see it right away."_

#### Takeaways
- [ ] Incorporate CTAs to both My VA Health and My HealtheVet into the same alert box in final design direction.
- [ ] Incorporate CTA headlines that include facility name into final design direction. 



## Participants preferred the yellow warning alert box style over the blue information box style
When discussing directions 1 and 2 in detail, I prompted participants to react to the UI style of the yellow alert box. In a few cases, participants identified and reached to the warning alert style before being prompted. Overall, participants said they liked this because it was clear that something had changed they needed to pay attention to. 

#### Quotes
* _"I got attracted by the yellow bar that's there - usually it means caution...when you see yellow, that stands out, they must have made an improvement."_

* _"I like that alert...I said "alert" bc it reminds me of some communications from credit cards - not negative but gets my attention, negative or positive."_

#### Takeaways
- [ ] Incorporate yellow warning alert box style into final design direction.



## The majority of participants voiced they overall wanted less content on the page
The reaction to direction 3 wasn't negative (meaning participants didn't find it unclear), yet participants felt it was too spread out. They didn't feel it was necessary to read all the information laid out in direction 3. One participant _did_ prefer this direction, citing that it "eliminated some of the guesswork" for her, however all other participants did not read the page as closely and react as positively to the UI of the page and the amount of information. In addition to reactions to direction 3, there was general feedback that less content was preferred. 

#### Quotes
* [Reacting to direction 3] _"That is a lot of information, too many places to click."_

* [Reacting to direction 3] _"Scrolling isn't bad, but I prefer [direction 2] - KISS: Keep It Simple Stupid."_

* [Reacting to extant Secure Messaging Page on VA.gov] _"I am just going to click on the first thing. Quickly reading I am going to say that’s good enough for me, if it is highlighted I am going to click on it."_

#### Takeaways
- [ ] Revisit alert box content with content team to determine if/how messaging can be consolidated. 

 

## There was confusion over the transition date
2/6 participants brought up questions about the transition date: 

1. P2 asked what would happen to a message sent on 3/27, and where they might go to find replies to a message sent on that date.
2. When asked to react to the copy "Go to MHV to view all messages, including those with Mann-Grandstaff, prior to March 28, 2017", 2 participants read that and thought, per the first half of the note, that all messages would still be in MHV.

#### Takeaways
- [ ] Revisit date messaging with content team to clarify how we communicate it. 
- [ ] Communicate question regarding transition date messaging to wider team for discussion.  



## Participants equated the first CTA with their primary VAMC 
2/6 participants referred to the first CTA to My VA Health as a CTA to message their primary facility, equating order of the CTAs with the relevance of those CTAs to their VAMC registrations.



## Participants weren't sure if they were still registered at prior facilities
3/6 participants said they might be registered at certain facilities, but weren't sure. While participants had mixed reactions to the message "You are registered at Mann-Grandstaff VA Medical Center" (1 participant disliked it, 2 participants found it helpful), incorporating that message into the final design direction will help users understand how My VA Health is relevant to their care, helping users understand which facility it's related to - primary or otherwise; actively using or otherwise.

#### Takeaways
- [ ] Incorporate "You are registered at [VA Medical Center Name]" into final design direction


# Appendix

### Multiple participants voiced pain points over multiple logins
3 participants brought up that keeping track of their multiple accounts, remembering/needing to change passwords, and needing to login multiple times when navigate between VA sites as pain points for them. To move participants away from this, I mentioned to 2 of them that VA.gov is exploring single sign-on. 

### Few participants use VA.gov to get to MHV
Most participants described going to VA.gov only to find information, not necessarily to manage their healthcare on MHV.
