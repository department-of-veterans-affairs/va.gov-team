## Summary

> These pages highlight critical challenges of data migration to the cloud. The findings address cost benefits, security, and customer concerns.

### Key Findings

- RQ1: What are the reported advantages to store data into the cloud?
    
    1. _Everyone who is a part of cyberspace is part of cloud computing, either he or she is aware or not aware. The growing number of mobile users do not need to save their mobile data manually, anymore, and cloud computing is making it easy now._
    2. _According to Forbes, **there are now 77 % of organizations, having one or some parts of their systems in the cloud,** stated as, "Enterprises predict **they will invest on average $3.5M on cloud apps,** platforms, and services this year"_
        - Here is the link [on Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2018/08/30/state-of-enterprise-cloud-computing-2018/?sh=32feffa1265e)
    3. Cost-effective solution: _**Price is one of the key benefits for organizations,** so they can concentrate on their core business while placing their main infrastructure services to the cloud service providers. On the other hand, **cloud computing is more environment- friendly compared to on-premises system, saves energy and provides cloud's green features reducing the number of physical materials** [14]_
    4. Business continuity: _Cloud backup solutions play an essential role in **a proactive approach to get maximum uptime like backup and recovery in a business continuity strategy.** Many businesses, especially financial organizations, **cannot afford downtime just for the sake of tracking and upgrading software's and systems** [13]_
    5. Security aspects: _**Cloud vendor’s obligation ensures that their infrastructure is secure, and their client's data and applications are well protected.** Cloud service providers provide a high-level security protocol to verify data protection by using encryption mechanisms [16]. The complex data centers of cloud providers built on layered security approaches which **include data encryption, key management, strong access controls, compliance with regular security audits** [17]._
    6. Scalable IT resources: _By scalable IT resources, most service providers will **allow organizations to increase their existing resources to accommodate their business needs or changes** [18]_
- RQ2: What are the key challenges to migrate data into the cloud according to the literature?
    
    7. Choosing the right vendor: _Therefore, **it is crucial that  companies ask cloud providers if they have appropriate data migration tools to move data** by considering the factors of vendor lock-in and portability (the ability of software to be transferred from one machine or system to another) [21]_
    8. Adaptability and process issue: _In fact, digital transformation is based on successful IT practices and infrastructures processes [22]. **In data and process migration, there is a need to design, execute, and monitor a plan to support the change.**_
    9. Trust deficit about cloud security: _Although cloud market giants have been promoting their in-place latest data security model, **the NSA snooping scandal creates doubt and rethink on storing all the critical and confidential data in the cloud [23]. This trust deficit impacts all major stakeholders like individual citizens, businesses, and governments.** As data stored in the cloud is easily accessible from anywhere, data breach due to low password security or hacking can result in a compromise of personal and business data. The organizations hosted their data locally with having full control and authority. **When they decide to migrate to the cloud, they may feel more vulnerable because hackers tend to target big data centers [24].**_
    10. Cost-benefit analysis: _A good set of organizations in the globe is in the process of implementing cloud computing as a core component of its technology approach [25]. But despite this overwhelming cloud momentum, **cost-benefit analysis models illustrating the business impact of cloud adoption are still a significant risk factor** [26]. It is sometimes challenging to redesign your current IT infrastructure (server, network, storage) to meet the requirement before moving to the cloud. Cloud providers charge customers on a variable cost pay-as-you-go basis determined by the number of users and their volume of transactions [27]. **Organizations are not readily willing to pay extra for system acquisitions, management, and additional bandwidth cost** [21]._
- RQ3: How migration strategies and models can help to deal with data migration concerns?
    - There is a table at this section that explains the cloud migration strategies.
        - Cloud migration strategies
            
            11. Re-hosting also known as "Lift and shift" technique is particularly effective in a large-scale enterprise, a migration strategy for moving an application or operating system from one environment to another – without redesigning the app [28].
            12. Re-platforming involves upgrading an application from its existing platform with the benefits of “backward compatibility” that allows developers to reuse the available resources [28].
            13. Repurchasing is a strategy of moving to a different product, for example swapping a self-run email system for an online email-as-a-service [30].
            14. Re-architecting. This solution involves re-building an application architecture by using the cloud-native features of PaaS and changing application components, ideal for business who need additional features, scale, or performance [28].
            15. Retiring. The process of cost optimization in which organizations just get rid of the un-used systems and applications [30].

## <a name="dblp"></a>DBLP - Understanding User Migration Patterns in Social Media - Conference: Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence

**[Article Link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221606296_Understanding_User_Migration_Patterns_in_Social_Media)**

### Summary

> This is a case study in 2015 regarding the user migration and retention of Reddit users from other platforms. The event is as follows: _**In a highly controversial event, on June 10th, 2015, Reddit administration banned five communities for hate speech and antagonizing other subreddits.**_

### Key Insights

1. In July 2015, a series of events on Reddit triggered a period of community unrest during which (a) many users publicly expressed a desire to leave
2. (b) several of the most popular communities, referred to as subreddits, took their
content offline in protest
3. Our work offers four key findings.
    - First, user interests are sufficiently diverse that no one platform caters to all users, despite platform’s near-identical functionality;
        - Indeed, the attraction of users to a particular platform follows from specific motivational interests, such as free speech or aversion to hate speech
    - Second, user behavior changes with migration events. Whereas an individual may contribute few posts and comments on Reddit, after migrating to a new platform, their level of contribution frequently increases.
        - Thus, even if the primary content contributors of Reddit do not migrate, this behavior change can help platforms attain a critical level of activity.
    - Third, a major draw of Reddit is its ability to support niche communities
        - Alternative platforms may attract sufficient users to aggregate content that appeals to a broad audience. But the very large user base of Reddit enables it to support niche content which many users cite as an important attraction.
    - And fourth, while smaller platforms have difficulty competing with respect to content-generation, they appear to foster a more congenial atmosphere, which may be an important driver of early growth.
4. Users contributing to the /r/RedditAlternatives community provided details of alternative platforms, from which we aggregated a list of 32 platforms.
    - Of these, 11 platforms were eliminated because they lacked publicly accessible content, were shut-down midway through the study, or because it was not possible determine content posting dates.
5. **This is their definition of user migration:** We take migration to be a substantial shift in activity, wherein the user’s smoothed activity is higher on alternatives than on Reddit for at least two weeks
6. The results are from a diagram in the paper:
    - Interestingly, the platforms that received the largest traffic spikes had low initial volume, whereas more established alternatives, such as HackerNews and Metafilter showed essentially no change.
    - We speculate that users had already considered using the established platforms at previous times
7. Based on another Figure in the study. Figure 3:
    - First, migrants have a significant activity increase on alternatives in the first week of moving.
        - users introducing themselves in content threads devoted to newcomers, which was most seen on Empeopled
        - users venting their frustration with Reddit policies and practices, mostly seen on Voat.
8. In this view, migration is a response to conditions that force populations to leave (push) or entice them to move to (pull) a location.
     - Their **theory (hypotheis)** is built on self reporting and a survey
     - The self reporting is a data skim of user comments.
9. In addition to the 2,987 analyzed comments, 267 users submitted valid surveys.
10. More than 70% of the responses came from users under age 35
11. 74% of the responders were male and 63% of the responders were from United States.
12. Among users who said they had reduced their Reddit usage in the survey, 50% viewed the banning of /r/FatPeopleHate negatively, while those who identified as continuing to use Reddit regularly viewed that action more positively (only 27% viewed it negatively).
13. Respondents who said they continued to use the platform regularly also identified the presence of hate speech on Reddit as the aspect of the platform they disliked the most (accounting for 50% of the 80 responses )
14. **Migrating users increase engagement**
15. **Niche communities play an important role in attracting users.**

## <a name="nngroup"></a>Nielsen Norman Group - *Indicators, Validations, and Notifications: Pick the Correct Communication Option*

**[Article Link](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/indicators-validations-notifications/)**

### Summary

> This article looks into how applications or websites give notifications. For the new study and feature, we should make the user migration obvious with indicators.

### Key insights

1. In interaction design, systems, applications, websites or hardware __*should always keep users informed*__, by providing appropriate feedback.

2. From the article: <br>
*There are at least three possible ways of implementing indicators:*
    - *Oftentimes, but not always, indicators are implemented as icons. Easily recognizable icons can make very effective communication tools.*
    - *Typographical variations can also be used as indicators; examples include the common convention of boldfacing unread email messages or color-coding stock symbols in an investment account if their price has changed substantially.*
    - *Though less common, enlarged size or animation (e.g., vibration) can also be used to make certain items stand out from the crowd and thus serve as an indicator.*

3. The characteristics of an indicator are as follows:
    - They are contextual. This means that the indicator is in close proximity to the element
    - They are conditional. They are not always present but should change or appear when conditions are met.
    - They are passive. Users should not take an action. __*An indicator is a communication tool*__

4. Notifications should __*Alert a user of general occurances in the system*__
    - This is not a validation state, it is a system state. It informs a user
    - The system state affects a user
    - Can be a global and contextual UI element

5. The characteristics of a Notification are as follows:
    - They are not triggered by users’ immediate actions.
    - They announce an event that has some significance to the user.

6. There are two types of Notifications:
    - __Action-required notifications__ - i.e. computer updates or actions that are required from a user
        - This is very intrusive and are often urgent
    - __Passive notifications__
        - These are not urgent and are usually less intrusive
        - These can be easily missed
        - Do not require a users' input
7.  In general, any type of ad tends to be ignored unless it is related to the users’ aims and mindset.
    - Make sure that the notification is not introduced during an existing action

**[Article Link](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-move-youtube-content-to-a-new-google-account)**

### Summary

> For Google and Youtube, retiring or merging accounts is usually done manually for power users or content creators.

### Key Insights

1. _Unfortunately, Google **doesn’t make it easy** to migrate information from one account to the other._
    - _As of right now, power users and content creators alike will need to **do a lot of the data migration manually.** The process requires several steps and takes some effort, but it is doable._
2. _**You can do this manually** if you click the Subscriptions icon and then click Manage to see a list of all your subscriptions. You can then open another browser, sign into your new account, and go through the list, re-subscribing to each entry._
3. _Another option is to use Google Takeout to export your subscription list as a CSV file** with links for each subscription that you can open in your new account. To do this in YouTube under your old account, click your profile icon in the upper right and select Your data in YouTube, then click Download YouTube data under the Your YouTube dashboard heading._
    - This is an example of using an application to export data
    - There is no importing option for YouTube
4. There is an extensive process to move a YouTube channel. [Go to Article](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-move-youtube-content-to-a-new-google-account#transfer-your-youtube-channel)

**[Article Link](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4403181904525-How-to-Migrate-Your-Mojang-Account-to-a-Microsoft-Account)**

### Summary

> This article shows two methods to migrating a Minecraft account to a Microsoft account. Overall the process requires a user to start the process by clicking a button on this page or similar, verify their account through email, and then go through account creation (mirgration).

### Key Findings

1. There are lots of images showing the steps or screens for each step
2. There is a __Migrate Button__ at the top of the article
3. __*If you are underage and require parental consent or you are a parent/guardian helping your child migrate their account*__, see How to Migrate Your Child’s Mojang Account to a Microsoft Account (Instructions for Parent/Guardian)_
4. When moving an Mojang account, there is a need to verify with an email code
5. You would then take that verification code to now create a Microsoft account
6. Next is to create an Xbox profile and Gamertag
    - _Please keep in mind that your **Microsoft Gamertag and your Minecraft username are independent of each other**, and additional information can be found here. **Your Minecraft username will transfer over automatically.**_
7. In the case you already have a Microsoft account, you will be prompted to log in after you receive your verification code
