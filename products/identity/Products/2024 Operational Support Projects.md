# 2024 Operational Support Projects

This group of projects ties into two separate Identity Team Objectives:
* __O1: Improve the VA.gov authentication experience -__ User authentication is widely recognized as the most challenging experience on VA.gov today. It's high friction, full of pitfalls, confusing, slow and error prone. We must improve the experience overall by depreciating legacy credentials, eliminating unnecessary infrastructure dependencies and developing and meeting all-new service level objectives.  This Objective is supported by Executive Order 14058 ("Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery to Rebuild Trust in Government").
* __O4: Empower VA.gov product teams -__  User authentication is the front door to VA healthcare and benefits online, and VA.gov product teams depend on us to power their authenticated experiences. We must support these teams - including My HeatheVet and My VA Health (Cerner) -- and the major initiatives to move health and benefits applications over to VA.gov.

## Improving Processes, Data & Communication
This first set of projects are all about making the Identity Team shine as a platform-oriented team by focusing on three major aspects of supporting other teams:
- __Processes:__ Developing processes for how we service and support Veterans who are logging into the site and va.gov teams who need help in the Identity team.
- __Data:__  Understanding data generated by Veterans logging into the site and our support of va.gov teams who need help in the Identity space.
- __Communication:__ Publishing those processes and that data generated in order to understand what is happening and identify ways of making things better.

Create internal and external commuincation channels for messaging and coordination during and after security incidents. | We want to be more robust, agile and effective in mitigating the impact of security incidents. Ensure Veterans and other VA stakeholders are informed, engaged and empowered to properly respond to security incidents.(O1KR2) | Jim |
