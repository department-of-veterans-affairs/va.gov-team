# Vets Login Data

## Overview: 
Publishing the Login Data we've collected in the SLOs to Veterans as Dashboards. This maps to _O1KR2: VA.gov authentication SLOs are developed._

Note: while this is a follow-up to the Login SLO project, we are not publishing any Service Level Agreements to Veterans.

## Problem Statement: 
We do not currently have any data presented to Veterans on how our login systems are functioning on a regular basis, and publishing dashboards to the Veterans will help us monitor and improve the Veteran login experience, as well as establish our reliability in their minds.

## What's In Scope: 
* Service Level Objectives
  * Determining what data to display on SLO dashboards for Veterans
  * Determining how to explain that data to Veterans.



## Out of Scope: (for this iteration)
* SLA for Veterans
* SLO & SLA for VA.gov Product Teams
* Incident Response
  * Accountability in SLOs - who gets assigned & their impact toward total numbers
    * Automation
      * Notify when investigations are happening.
      * Slack notifications when SLOs reach a certain level.


## Use Cases:
- As a Veteran, I would like to see high-level data visualizations related to the status and performance of authentication services on VA.gov, so that I am provided with immediate, comprehensive information about the status of services that I am using. 



## Assumptions:
- We publish around the dashboard created in the Login SLO project.


## Solution Approach: 



  
## Technical Considerations:
| Issue         | Notes         | 
| ------------- |:-------------| 
| VA Policy |  Is there VA policy surrounding availability & response times?     |
| Industry Standards |  Are there industry standards surrounding availability & response times?     |

## UX/ Design Considerations:
| Issue         | Notes         | 
| ------------- |:------------- | 
| Explaining what the dashboards mean |   Would like UX help in crafting the publishing language          |
| Veterans who don't speak tech | How do we ensure they understand what they might be seeing? |


## Measuring Success:
| KPI           | Notes         | 
| ------------- |:-------------| 
| How are we meeting the SLA  |    |




## Milestones:
* SLA are agreed-upon.
* 



## Future Scope:
* Determining our response to observed service degradation.
* As the Identity Team adds new products and takes on new responsibilities, it is anticipated that new SLA will need to be established and published.
