# Request & Support Process MVP

## Overview: 

Top Goals:  One of our 2024 OKRs is develop an Identity Team Request & Support process for va.gov, which will help us help other teams far more efficiently than currently.

* Create an intake process for feature requests, updates, bug fixes, data requests, etc.
* Allow folks to self-service (access pre-existing materials/answers/FAQ's as much as possible)
* Ability to view all requests holistically.

Create solutions to manage & fulfill requests from other va.gov Product Teams, possibly including:
* Intake form
* Summation of the work we need to do

Potential add-ons (but not primary goal)
* Estimate of the time it will take (post initial in-take)
* Prioritization of the request vs. other requests (should be out of scope, dependent of PRODUCT prioritization)

NOTE: As we started doing research, we realized that it would be best to do a MVP (Minimum Viable Product) with a small number of requests in order to test and learn from it. Ideally, how Identity supports other va.gov teams will evolve over time.

## Problem Statement: 
The Identity team has products that other teams require our assistance with to do their jobs properly. Over time, the number of requests have increased to the point where it is no longer feasible to manage these requests manually. So we need to develop a formal process in order to intake and resolve requests as efficiently as possible.

## Potential deliverables:
- Research findings
- A slackbot to take requests
- A request fulfillment process
- Request tracking

## What's In Scope (MVP): 
For this first iteration, the focus will be on developing the processes as needed to support other teams' requests. For MVP, we've focused on four types of requests
- PR Review
- Data pulls
- Test User Authentication Issues


These were chosen because these are requests that our team unambiguously fulfills, and we believe that if we run these cases through the full request and support process, we can then expand it to understand other kinds of requests.

## Out of Scope (MVP): 
*  Request types that aren't the three listed above.
*  Deflection & self service, outside of links to documentation.
*  Communication from Github to the ID Bot
   * Notifying the thread automatically when, say, someone picked up the ticket
*   Creating metrics to start tracking how we are doing
     

## Use Cases:
| User          | Problem       | Solution to their Problem |
| :------------- |:------------- | :----- |
|Va.gov product team member| Want to ask a data pull| [Slackbot form will standardize data pull request](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/identity-5f5bab705a94c9001ba33734/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/77443)  |
|Va.gov product team member | Want to ask for PR review  | [Slackbot form will standardize PR review request](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/identity-5f5bab705a94c9001ba33734/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/77415) | 
|Va.gov product team member  | Having issues with Mock Auth   | [Slackbot form will standardize Mock Auth issue request](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/identity-5f5bab705a94c9001ba33734/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/77444) |

|Identity team member | No standardized language to communicate with users  | [Standardized language for each part of the process](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/identity-5f5bab705a94c9001ba33734/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/77495) |
|Identity team member | I don't have a top-level view of the requests | [Slackbot will create tickets that will live in a tracker](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/identity-5f5bab705a94c9001ba33734/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/74677)



## Assumptions:
* We leverage previous experience supporting other teams to create this process.

## Solution Approach: 
* We piggyback off of the slackbot developed for the SiS Project and use it to expand the range of requests captured. The slackbot will respond to the _/help_ command in the #vfs-identity channel. For MVP, it will have the following choices:
  - Test User Authentication Help
  - Sign-In Service Integration
  - PR Review Request
  - Data Request
  - Other

We obviously won't worry about Sign-In Service, as that has it's own flow, but "Other" will be useful in determining what choices we want to add next.

  
## Technical Considerations:
| Issue         | Notes         | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Slackbot / Github Connection | Right now, we can have slack can write to github, but not vice versa        |
| Potential Move to Jira | If/when we move to Jira, how much of this work will be duplicated? |

## UX/ Research Ideas Considerations:
| Issue         | Notes         | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Gather Metrics from Slack  |               |
| Survey from Team  |               |
| Inventory of Methods used for intake across VA teams  |               |


## Measuring Success:
Measuring the success of the Request & Support process project will be part of the focus of an entire project: O4KR2 - Establish and publish monthly metrics around response times for VA.gov product teams.

That said, some initial thoughts on what that project might entail.
| KPI           | Notes         | 
| ------------- |:-------------| 
| Number of requests | On a monthly basis, we track how many requests were fulfilled via the Request & Support | 
| Percentage of requests | On a monthly basis, we track the percentage of requests that were fulfilled via the Request & Support tracker |
| Customer Satisfaction | Create a customer satisfaction survey



## Baseline KPI Values:
