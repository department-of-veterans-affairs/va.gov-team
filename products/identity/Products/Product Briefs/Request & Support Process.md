# Request & Support Process

## Overview: 
Create processes & forms & dashboards to manage & fulfill requests from other va.gov Product Teams:
* Intake form
* Summation of the work we need to do
* Estimate of the time it will take
* Prioritization of the request vs. other requests
* (other ideas as suggested by the team)


## Problem Statement: 
Currently, we have no process in place to take requests from other product teams, track what we are doing to fulfill those requests, and manage the overall workload created by those requests.

One of our 2024 OKRs is develop a Request & Support process for va.gov, which will help us help other teams far more efficiently than currently.
