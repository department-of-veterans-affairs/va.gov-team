# Identity Monthly Metrics

## Overview: 
Publish a set of monthly metrics surrounding our support of other teams in accordance with O4KR2: _Establish and publish monthly metrics around response times for VA.gov product teams._  

While many of the metrics will be more of an informational nature, there is one this is incredibly important: our Customer Satisfaction score. This will be gathered using a survey to be deployed in #vfs-identity slack channel, our github page, at least.  This survey will be the key part of fulfilling O4KR3: _Establish and maintain a support satisfaction rating of 70% or greater for VA.gov product team support_.

Two OKRs with one project!

This is a follow-up to the Request & Support project.


## Problem Statement: 
As the Identity Team becomes more of a platform team, we want to have more visibility into how we actually support other teams, as well as transparency as to how those other teams view our support.  Our solution is to publish metrics surrounding our support.

## What's In Scope: 
For this first iteration, the focus will be on:
* Dashboards that display the following metrics:
  * Counting Metrics
    * Tickets Opened
      * All Time
      * Previous Month
    * Tickets Closed
      * All Time
      * Previous Month
    * Tickets by Current Status
    * Tickets Requests by Team
      * All Time
      * Previous Month
    * Ticket Requests by Product
      * All Time
      * Previous Month
  * Calculated Metrics
    * Average Days to Close Tickets
      * All Time
      * Previous Month
  * Satisfaction Metrics
    * Survey Score
      * All Time
      * Previous Month
* Creating a Comms strategy for socializing these metrics on (at least) a monthly basis
  


## Out of Scope: (for this iteration)
* SLO Metrics
* Service Level Agreements

## Use Cases:
| User          | Problem       | Solution |
| ------------- |:------------- | :----- |
| VA.Gov Team member | Wants to know how many tickets the Identity Team has opened  | Open Tickets dashboard |
| VA.Gov Team member | Wants to know how many tickets the Identity Team has closed   | Closed Tickets dashboard  |
| VA.Gov Team member | Wants to know how many tickets have which current status | Status dashboard  |
| VA.Gov Team member | Wants to know which teams have made requests from Identity  | Ticket Requests by Team dashboard  |
| VA.Gov Team member | Wants to know which which products the Identity team has helped with | Ticket Requests by Product dashboard  |
| VA.Gov Team member | Wants to know how long, on average, it takes the Identity team to close a ticket | Average Days to Close Tickets dashboard  |
| Va.Gov Team member | Wants to know the CSR score of the Identity Team | CSR dashboard |
| VA.Gov Team member | Wants to know how to find all of this information | Comms strategy to continually point people to these dashboards |

## Assumptions:
* The number of tickets will increase over time.
* This process will change and grow as we come up with new things to measure.
* ID Bot is used by people in #vsp-identity.
* People fill out the Satisfaction Survey.
* People are looking at the documentation we've provided.

## Solution Approach: 
* Create a ticket with the Analytics team to set up dashboards with the counting and calculated metrics.
* Set up a dashboard to display the Satisfaction metrics gathered from the Slack survey previously deployed.
* Determine how to publish these metrics to other VA.gov teams.
