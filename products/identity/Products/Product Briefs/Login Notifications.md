# Login Notifications

## Overview: 
Send Veterans notifications when there is a login to their account under what might be fradulent circumstances, including:
* Logins from New Devices
* Unusual Account Activity
* Password Reset Requests
* Changes to Security Settings
* Logins From High-Risk Locations



## Problem Statement: 
If we send a Veteran notification about a login that they did not initiate, it can serve as an early warning sign of unauthorized access or a security breach.

One of our OKRs reducing the time to detect fraud by 10%, and by notifiying Veterans of unusual logins, they can help identify fraud much earlier than they have been able to previously. 

In addition, Veterans can take immediate steps, such as changing passwords, reviewing account activity, or contacting the VA, in order to secure their accounts and prevent further unauthorized actions. Eventually, we can allow them to lock their accounts.

## What's In Scope: 
For this first iteration, the focus will be on email notifications.
* 

## Out of Scope: (for this iteration)
* Locking accounts
* Opt-in to other kinds of notifications
* These kind of notifications do not already exist
* * If they exist, then we can set up a configuration not to trigger an email for those cases

## Use Cases:

## Assumptions:
* We can detect logins matching each of the Use Cases above
* We can leverage the work already done by the [va-notify team](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/va-notify#playbook)
