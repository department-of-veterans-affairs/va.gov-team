**Exemption Access Page for MHV Credential Deprecation**

**Problem Statement**

*The deprecation of MHV credentials leaves certain users without access to critical VA services. To address this gap, a dedicated page provides approved exemption users with temporary access to MHV's sign-in page while a permanent delegate access solution is developed.*

**Current Functionality**

* Unique URL that VA staff share with approved exemption users.  
* Page contains a button leading to the MHV sign-in page.  
* No additional workflows or integrations.

**Dependencies**

* MHV maintaining their credential sign-in functionality.

**Known Risks & Limitations**

* If MHV removes or updates their sign-in page, this stopgap solution will fail.  
* Manual effort required for VA staff to identify and share the URL with approved users.

**Success Metrics**

* Approved users successfully accessing MHV sign-in via the URL.  
* Page is accessible 100% of the time during its use.  
* No reported issues from users or VA staff.

**Ownership**

* Identity is responsible for maintaining this page.

**Sunset Plan**

* Once the delegate access MVP is implemented, plan to decommission this page.
