# 2024 Fraud Prevention, Detection & Remediation Projects

Each one of these projects ties to our overall Objective to mitigate digital identity fraud.

Online scams and their sophistication have increased dramatically in the last few years, resulting in account takeovers, stolen PII/PHI, and payment redirection. With more Veterans receiving benefits than ever before, and the need to access and manage them online, Veterans are a prime target.

We're tackling it from three angles:
- Fraud Prevention: trying to prevent fraud from happening in the first place.
- Fraud Detection: when fraud happens, we want to discover it swiftly in order to prevent further fraud on the same account and getting the remediation process into gear.
- Fraud Remediation: ensuring that we help them recover their accounts as swiftly as possible.

## Fraud Prevention

| Project Name          | What is It?       | Why Are We Doing It? | PM |
| :------------- |:------------- | :----- | :----- |
| Government-wide Initiative to Prevent Fraud | Participate in 1 government-wide initiative on preventing identity fraud in public benefits programs. | The more we can help Veterans prevent fraud, the fewer time and resources will go into detection and remediation, and the fewer Veteran lives will be disrupted by fraudlent actors. (O3KR4) | Jim  |
| Comms Campaign w. BDPR & VSAFE | Create 1 communications campaign with BDPR and VSAFE | Ongoing communication with our Veterans about preventing, detecting & remediating fraud will help with prevention and detection, and will make remediation smoother.  (O3) | Jim  |
| FIDO Key |  Allow Veterans to use Fast Identity Online (FIDO) authentication to login to VA.gov | FIDO will create speedier sign-ins, improve success and reduce password hacks. (O3)| Jim |

## Fraud Detection

| Project Name          | What is It?       | Why Are We Doing It? | PM |
| :------------- |:------------- | :----- | :----- |
| User Notifications | Send Veterans notifications when there is a login to their account under what might be fradulent circumstances. | These notifications can serve as an early warning sign of unauthorized access, with the goal of helping to reduce the time to detect fraud on VA.gov by 10% OKR. (O3KR1)| Jim |
| RISC Integration w/ VA.gov | Tap into va.govs RISC api to automatically let BDPR know there was an account being compromised. | This goes directly to our objective to reduce the time to detect Fraud on VA.gov by 10%.  (O3KR2) | Jim |
| User Activity Logging | Create logs of certain types of user activity on va.gov  | This will help us research what kind of user activity might be considered suspicious, with the goal of reducing time to detect fraud.  (O3KR1) |  Jim |
| Create Fraud Detection Engine | The follow-on from User Activity logging. As we become confident in the kinds of events that would constitute fraud, we could catch them, or even stop them from happening. This might be a potential use case for AI. | Shortening the time it might take detect fraud. (O3KR1) | Jim  |
| Audit DB For User Actions | Create a database to track user actions across va.gov | To let users keep track of what they've done on the site. They can then detect potentially fraudulent activity.  (O3KR1) |  Jim |
| Show User Actions on VA.gov| Let users see their history on VA.gov. | Users would be able to see which actions.  (O3KR1)| Jim  |
| Users Can Lock Own Accounts | If a user suspects that there might be fraudulent activity, they can take instant action. | While fraud might have already taken place, the Veteran can instantly keep it from deepening, and if fraud has actually taken place, begin the remediation process. (O3KR1) | Jim  |

## Fraud Remediation

| Project Name          | What is It?       | Why Are We Doing It? | PM |
| :------------- |:------------- | :----- | :----- |
| Fraud User Remediation | Shortening the time to remediate victims of fraud | It's bad enough to be a victim of fraud, so we want to shorten the time it takes for the Veteran to be able to use their account. (O3) | Jim |
