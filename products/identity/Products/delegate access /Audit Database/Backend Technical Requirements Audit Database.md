# Backend Technical Requirements

## Audit Table Considerations
- **Audit Report Export**: Create the ability to generate a formal report to be used for official reviews of user activity.
  - Need a way to generate an audit log export by an admin/authorized user on Rails.
  - Optional: Include a method to facilitate the export process.
- **Access Control**: Limit access to the audit log to authorized personnel or provide users with access to their own logs only.
- **Notification System**: Consider alerting users to significant changes (e.g., password changes) via email or in-app notifications.
- **Retention**: All events must be stored for 7 years and deleted after 7 years.
- **Report Request SLA**: Audit reports will be produced within two business days of request.
- **Database**:
  - Need an immutable database.
  - Optional: Include a read-only replica for audit export to improve performance.
  - Optional: Batch events to improve performance.

# Functional Requirements

## User Authentication and Authorization
- Ensure proper access control for viewing logs (users can only see their own logs).

## Event Tracking Mechanism
- Develop a system to capture user events that other apps within VA.gov can adopt, similar to Rails logger.
- Define which events need to be logged and their corresponding attributes.

## Database Design
- Create a database schema to store log entries, including fields like:
  - **Timestamp**
  - **User ICN**
  - **User CSP UUID**
  - **User ICN performing action, role**
  - **Event Type**
  - **Event Description**
  - **IP Address, location**
  - **Device**
  - **Status/Outcome**
- Optimize the database for efficient querying and filtering.
  - Consider normalization and the "user snapshot" suggestion.

## API Development
- Design endpoints for:
  - Storing new log entries.
  - Retrieving log entries based on user ID, event type, date range, etc.

## Error Handling and Logging
- Implement error handling for logging failures or issues.
- Maintain a secondary logging system to track errors or anomalies in the audit log process.

## Data Privacy and Security
- Ensure that sensitive data is anonymized or encrypted where necessary.
- Comply with relevant data protection regulations (CCPA, VA Privacy Policy, Terms of Use).

# Non-Functional Requirements

## Performance
- Ensure the audit system can handle a high volume of events without significant delays.
- Optimize database queries for fast retrieval of events.

## Scalability
- Design the system to accommodate future growth in user base and event logging.

## Maintainability
- Write clean, well-documented code to facilitate future updates and debugging.
- Use modular design principles for easy maintenance.

## Testing
- Implement unit and integration tests for all components of the audit log system.
- Conduct performance testing to ensure the system can handle expected loads.

## Monitoring and Alerts
- Set up monitoring for the logging system to track performance and error rates.
- Implement alerts for critical failures or unusual activity patterns.

# Collaboration Requirements

## Collaboration with Frontend Engineers
- Work closely with frontend engineers to ensure the API aligns with the user interface requirements.
- Coordinate on data formats and how logs will be presented to users.

## Security and Compliance Collaboration
- Collaborate with Joe to ensure that all logging practices meet compliance standards.
- Regularly review security practices in light of evolving regulations.

## Documentation
- **Technical Documentation**: Create comprehensive documentation for the logging system, including API specifications, database schema, and event definitions.
