~~~text
Other `/logout` errors will *not* result in an error being returned, but rather an attempt to
  1.) Redirect to the URI set in the `ClientConfig`'s `logout_redirect_uri`
  2.) Return a `200 OK` status if no redirect URI is configured.
  
The following error case scenarios are covered by this behavior.
  - Access token JWT malformed
  - Access Token JWT expired
  - Session not authorized
  - Session not found
