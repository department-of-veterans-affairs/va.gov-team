# General
**From which services does SiS ultimately pull user data?**

Yes we still use MPI.

**Why should it be using a different UUID for the VAOS Session? **

The Accounts table is being deprecated in favor of User Accounts, but Accounts technically works and the VAOS::Session Service is still using it for sessions.

You fixed a review instance for us. Do we have to let you know if this ever breaks? 
Yes, we donâ€™t actively use review instances; you'll be the ones to find out first if they broke.
