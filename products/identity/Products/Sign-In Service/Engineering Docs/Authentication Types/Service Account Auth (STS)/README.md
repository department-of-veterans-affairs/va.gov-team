# Service Account Auth (STS)

## Overview
The Service Account Auth (STS) mechanism provides secure server-to-server access tokens with scoped routes. The process involves requesting a token using a JWT signed with a private key, which is then verified using a public certificate. Once authenticated, the token allows access to protected routes defined by specific scopes.
