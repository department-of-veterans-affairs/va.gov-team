# **Synopsis of Production Test Account (PTA) Research Findings**

## **Overview**

**Who We Spoke To**

For this research study, we spoke with 5 MHV coordinators who leverage production test accounts and 1 additional MHV coordinator who did not use production test accounts; these conversations were guided by the following [Research Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Products/Production%20Test%20Accounts/Research/%5B%20Research%20Plan%20%5D%20Demo%20Mode%20-%20Rx%20refill%20and%20Secure%20Messaging%20Training.md) and [Conversation Guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Products/Production%20Test%20Accounts/Research/%5BConversation%20Guide%20%5D%20MHV%20Coordinators%20-%20Training%20and%20Troubleshooting.md).

**Critical Role of PTAs in Training Clinical and Support Staff**

MHV coordinators reported that they are provide training to clinical and support staff like physicians, nurses and office administrators.  When they have no other options, production test accounts become essential tools to support this job function across the various sites covered by the coordinators we spoke to (Boston, Minneapolis, Maine, and New Hampshire VA). The coordinator who does not use these PTAs for training leverages her own personal account to train staff (presenting a big personal risk of exposing PII and compromising her own medical records). 

In order to properly train staff, coordinators simulate an interaction from the patient side so that the clinical staff can see what their patients see.  This is particularly important for secure messaging protocols and prescription refills since most staff will not be able to see the patient side user interface. When PTAs were unavailable due to technical reasons a few months ago, coordinators were forced to cancel scheduled trainings entirely, with one noting they had to reschedule multiple sessions and renegotiate available training times with busy clinical staff.

**Primary Use Cases for PTAs**

Coordinators use PTAs for three main purposes:   
(1) Training clinical staff (all new clinical staff must complete mandatory one-hour secure messaging training before messaging privileges are granted) by demonstrating portal features during live sessions. One coordinator emphasized hands-on training methodology: "I turn over \[screen sharing\] to the staff member...instead of death by PowerPoint, you're going to be doing the hands-on training."   
(2) Remote training sessions with Veterans but these sessions are limited since the population who require assistance are not technically savvy.  This means that MHV coordinators are unable to help many of these Veterans remotely and ask that they come in-person for assistance.  
(3) Creating visual guides and screenshots for remote veteran support.  However, this use case isn't as common since the website changes frequently and materials become outdated quickly.

### Direct Veteran Support: PTAs Are Rarely Used

When working directly with veterans, coordinators overwhelmingly prefer to use:

1. **The veteran's own device** \- "I love it when they have their own laptop, because then I'm showing them stuff that they can take home and use the same way" (P4)

2. **Veterans' actual accounts** \- Multiple coordinators emphasized having veterans do the work themselves: "when they hand me the phone, I say, no, we're gonna have you do it, because our adult learners do much better when they're doing repetition and doing it on their own" (P1)

3. **Kiosk computers with veteran credentials** \- "We have a computer that's dedicated to the veterans...I make sure that they understand the steps before I let them leave my office" (P5)

4. **Their own VA.gov accounts** \- "I will sign into my own VA.gov account, just because it's faster." (P3)  

**Why PTAs aren't used much for Veteran training:**

* Veterans need to practice on their actual accounts to retain the knowledge  
* Using PTAs doesn't help with the \#1 problem: login credential issues  
* Veterans can't access PTAs at home, so showing them PTA workflows is less helpful  

**The Exception: Training Materials**

PTAs serve one important veteran-facing function: **creating screenshots and visual guides for remote support**. P1 described using PTAs to "go and do a screenshot, and then I put it in a secure message...with little arrows. I develop, like, a Word document, and, you know, click here, then this."  However, coordinators rarely create their own training materials and are actively discouraged from creating these types of materials (P1) (P5).  The rationale for this is because the materials need to be standardized and the messaging consistent across the board.  

### Critical Importance: Staff Training

PTAs are **irreplaceable** for training clinical staff, which is mandatory before staff can use secure messaging.  Clinical staff are using a staff interface but are shown what secure messaging looks like for the Veteran patients.  MHV coordinators will use the PTAs to send a secure meessage to clinical staff, and the staff member will respond with whichever staff-side interface they are using.:

* **"Without the production test account, you can't launch messages, you can't show them stuff in its natural habitat"** (P4)

* **When PTAs went down:** "I had a training...and I'm like, can't get on...I felt inadequate trying to limp through and do my training"\*\* (P1) \- she had to cancel the training entirely

* **"I had a staff member that I had to train up, and I told them that we had to cancel training"** (P5) when PTAs were unavailable

**Why PTAs are essential for staff training:**

* Demonstrates what veterans see without exposing personal information  
* Allows hands-on practice with secure messaging workflows  
* Shows patient safety protocols in real-time (recalls, emergency messages)  
* Enables staff to understand the full veteran experience  
* Can be shared via Teams for remote training sessions

### The Indirect Impact

While PTAs aren't directly used for veteran troubleshooting, **trained clinical staff provide better veteran support**. When staff understand what veterans see and experience, they:

* Give better instructions over the phone  
* Become "champions" who can help veterans independently  
* Reduce escalations to MHV coordinators  
* Provide more empathetic, informed support

### Bottom Line

**For direct veteran troubleshooting: Low importance** (primarily for remote screenshot creation)

**For training staff who support veterans: Absolutely critical** (100% essential \- trainings are canceled without PTAs)

**Overall impact: Very high** \- because well-trained staff multiply the coordinator's effectiveness across the entire facility

As P5 emphatically stated: **"When they said there was a rumor that the test patient was going away, I was dumbfounded. I didn't know what to...I wouldn't know how to train the staff...please don't take away the test patient, ever."**

## Hypothesis Validation from PTA Research Transcripts

#### H1: MHV coordinators use production test accounts to train on standardized, repeatable aspects of both workflows (e.g., navigation, form completion, message composition).

**FINDING: MOSTLY TRUE**

**Evidence:** P4 explicitly states: "We use the production test account to trade messages and to go over our patient safety, privacy, and quality sorts of messages" and describes training 1,300 clinicians on secure messaging workflows. P5 confirms: "I use the test patient to send messages to this particular test team...the staff member gets to actually click the messages, reply to the messages, reassign the messages, they get to do everything." P3 uses PTAs to show "what exactly patients see in VA.gov for prescriptions" during pharmacy staff training.

**Justification:** All coordinators use PTAs for standardized secure messaging training and demonstrating portal navigation to staff. However, PTAs are rarely used for direct veteran workflow training—coordinators prefer veterans practice on their own accounts. The hypothesis is mostly true for staff training but not for veteran training.

---

#### H2: When issues are escalated through the call center, Tier 2 and Tier 3 representatives utilize PTAs to replicate the issues a Veteran is experiencing in order to help them problem solve unique issues.

**FINDING: UNCONFIRMED**

**Justification:** The research did not include call center representatives, so this hypothesis cannot be validated or refuted from these transcripts. The scope was limited to facility-based coordinators who have different workflows and access patterns than remote help desk staff.

---

#### H3: MHV coordinators and call center representatives view Production Test Accounts as a necessary tool in their day to day jobs for troubleshooting complex issues Veterans encounter.

**FINDING: MOSTLY FALSE**

**Evidence:** P1 states when veterans have issues, "we troubleshoot to get in to access, maybe change your password" using the veteran's own account, not PTAs. P4 describes troubleshooting: "guy wanted to do his travel...He had his laptop...I had him log in" to his own account. P5 confirms direct veteran support uses "their own credentials, for sure" on the kiosk computer, and uses PTAs only "for any classes that I have to give to staff members."

**Justification:** Coordinators consistently emphasized that PTAs are essential for **staff training**, not veteran troubleshooting. When helping veterans with complex issues (login problems, duplicate accounts, travel claims), coordinators use the veteran's actual account, MPI access, and calls to ID.me—not PTAs. As P5 noted, PTAs are "very valuable" but specifically for training, not day-to-day veteran troubleshooting.

---

#### H4: Secure messaging and prescription refill training is complex and requires hands-on demonstration.

**FINDING: TRUE**

**Evidence:** P4 mandates "Nobody gets to be on secure messaging, etc, until they've had a modicum of training where we do patient safety, etc" and demonstrates "Should you get a secure message, and it seems like somebody is having an emergency...we have to take immediate action." P5 requires all new clinical staff complete a "mandatory one-hour class" before messaging privileges, emphasizing "instead of death by PowerPoint, you're going to be doing the hands-on training...they get to actually click the messages, reply to the messages, reassign the messages." P3 teaches pharmacy staff using PTAs because "understanding what patients are looking at when they're trying to explain something to them makes it better."

**Justification:** All coordinators require mandatory hands-on training before granting secure messaging access, covering patient safety protocols (emergency recognition, recall buttons, privacy), appropriate response quality, and three-day reply timeframes. The complexity and safety implications make demonstration essential, not optional.

---

#### H5: Leveraging PTAs for training correlates positively with Veteran self-sufficiency in both healthcare workflows.**

\*\*FINDING: UNCONFIRMED (Insufficient Evidence)

**Evidence:** P1 describes hands-on veteran training philosophy: "when they hand me the phone, I say, no, we're gonna have you do it, because our adult learners do much better when they're doing repetition and doing it on their own," but this uses the veteran's own device, not PTAs. P3 emphasizes teaching veterans directly: "we show them how to set up their preferences...show them just basic things...we usually call it our 5 or 10 minute spiel that we give them after they're logged in" using the veteran's actual account.

**Justification:** While coordinators emphasize veteran self-sufficiency through hands-on learning, they achieve this by having veterans practice on their **own accounts and devices**, not via PTAs. The transcripts show PTAs improve **staff** competency (which indirectly helps veterans), but provide no evidence that PTA-based training directly correlates with veteran self-sufficiency. The causal relationship in the hypothesis cannot be confirmed from these data.

## Additional Insights

**The Login Credential Crisis**

* The transition from legacy My HealthyVet credentials to ID.me and Login.gov represents the overwhelming challenge.  All of the MHV coordinators we spoke to reported that they spent a lot of time helping Veterans transition to modern credentials.   
* A coordinator stated that Veterans are frustrated that the VA has lack of control over updating and fixing issues related to emails, phone numbers, etc. and could not understand that Login.gov and ID.me are external to the VA.  (P6)
* Some coordinators spend 2+ hours daily on hold with ID.me (which doesn't open until 10:30 AM, frustrating early-morning veterans).   
* A few of the MHV coordinators stated that Login.gov's help desk was not helpful and some stated outright that there was no support from Login.gov.  
* It requires some Veterans 4+ hours to complete registration due to multiple ID.me/Login.gov accounts, duplicate MPI records, or lost email access. Phone-based support proves particularly inadequate—"what could have been 5-10 minutes in person takes 30 minutes to an hour."  
* The aging veteran demographic faces compounded difficulties: QR codes on marketing materials are ineffective when veterans "don't know which way to hold the phone" or even how to switch from screen to screen to obtain codes.

**Travel Pay: The Second-Most Problematic Feature**

After login credentials, **beneficiary travel reimbursement** emerges as the most challenging feature for veterans, with MHV coordinators frequently handling travel issues despite it being outside their official scope. 

* P3 describes it as one of the "most common need\[s\] for help" because "when they get into the beneficiary travel, they try to follow along, but, especially if there's community care, if the facility hasn't loaded in that particular site, then they can't find it to put on a travel claim."   
* P4 notes this is so common that "I'm not supposed to be doing travel, I'm a My Healthy Vet guy, but I never turn anybody away, and I showed him how to do his travel using VA.gov."   
* P1 confirms the problem's scope, explaining that at her location in Brockton, "logistically, we're across from travel, and travel is impacted. You need the credentials...we're doing a lot of travel support" because the travel office is understaffed and only operates 2-3 days per week.   
* P5 indicates that veterans specifically seek help with "beneficiary travel, with the VA Health and Benefits app" as a primary reason for visiting. 

**Infrastructure and Demographic Challenges**

* VERCs provide essential hands-on support, but many CBOCs lack public Wi-Fi, forcing coordinators to create personal hotspots or being unable to provide in-person support. 

**Communication Breakdown**

Coordinators feel isolated from decision-makers. The "Neighborhood" peer network serves as the primary—and often only—reliable information channel where MHV coordinators can speak to one another, share resources and help unblock one another. However, MHV coordinators stated difficulty with getting support beyond their peer group.  They stated that there areno clear escalation paths, with multiple conflicting reporting mechanisms (IT tickets, help desk, contact forms). Coordinators desperately want updated, approved support materials but are told not to create their own, yet official materials arrive slowly or contain outdated information.

**Systemic Resource Constraints**

Most coordinators work alone or with minimal support, and their job responsibilities often expand beyond their official scope.  They handle both veteran support and staff training, manage secure messaging escalations, create training materials, and provide general technology education.  PTAs are one tool in their toolbox that they have come to rely on to enable them to multiply their ability to provide support to Veterans.

## Summary
If PTAs go away, MHV coordinators will need something they can use to train staff.  Demo mode may or may not be the right solution for that particular issue.  However, there is a larger issue that needs to be addressed, providing support to MHV coordinators who are the front-line staff that assist Veterans with not only gaining access to their digital accounts but also to healthcare and benefits.  From these conversations, coordinators are doing their best to help Veterans transition to modern credentials amongst a myriad of other tasks and are often overwhelmed while also feeling like they are unable to remove roadblocks for their Veterans.
