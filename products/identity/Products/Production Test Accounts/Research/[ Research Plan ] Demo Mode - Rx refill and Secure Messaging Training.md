# Research Plan: MHV Coordinators and Production Test Accounts (PTAs) for Healthcare Workflow Training

## Background
This research aims to understand how My HealtheVet (MHV) coordinators and call center representatives currently utilize Production Test Accounts (PTAs) for training and troubleshooting issues, specifically focusing on two key workflows: 1. Veterans refilling prescriptions and 2. secure messaging between providers and Veterans. This round of research will NOT include testing end-to-end testing scenarios for feature development.

## Primary Research Objective
The study will provide insights to inform the potential solution of a demo mode to meet the needs of this use case to train Veters and troubleshoot/replicate issues. 

## Research Questions

### Primary Research Questions
1. **Current Usage Patterns**: How are MHV coordinators and call center representatives currently using Production Test Accounts (PTAs) for prescription refill and secure messaging training and troubleshooting? How do coordinators and call center representatives use PTAs for training on prescription refills and secure messaging?

2.  **Workflow Integration**: How do Production Test Accounts fit into MHV coordinators' existing training workflows for prescription refills and secure messaging?
   
4.  **Pain Points**: What are the pain points and successes MHV coordinators and call center representatives experience when using Production Test Accounts for these use cases?
   
5. **Training**: What aspects of PTA-supported training are most and least effective for Veterans across both prescription refill and secure messaging workflows? 

6. **Troubleshooting Applications**: In what specific troubleshooting scenarios do MHV coordinators and call center reps rely on Production Test Accounts for prescription refill and secure messaging issues?

7. **Workarounds**: Are there any workarounds that coordinators/call center representatives can utilize?

## Hypotheses

### Primary Hypotheses
**H1**: MHV coordinators use production test accounts to train on standardized, repeatable aspects of both workflows (e.g., navigation, form completion, message composition).

**H2**: Call center representatives utilize PTAs to replicate the issues a Veteran is excperiencing in order to help them problem solve unique issues. 

**H3**: MHV coordinators and call center representatives view Production Test Accounts as a necessary tool in their day to day jobs.

**H4**: Secure messaging and prescription refill training is complex and requires hands on demonstration.

**H5**: MHV coordinators and call center representatives have no other tools at their disposal for troubleshooting complex issues Veterans encounter.

**H6**: Leveraging in PTAs for training correlates positively with Veteran self-sufficiency in both healthcare workflows.


## Research Methodology

### Phase 1: Discovery Research (1 sprint)
**Approach**: Qualitative exploration through moderated interviews with observation sessions

**Methods**:
- Moderated interviews with observation sessions (45-60 minutes each)
- Target participants: At least 3 MHV coordinators and at least 3 call center representatives

**Key Areas of Investigation**:
- Current Production Test Account usage patterns and frequency for both workflows
- Specific training scenarios where Production Test Accounts are employed for prescription refills and secure messaging
- Coordinator and call center representative-developed best practices and workarounds for each workflow
- Integration with other training tools and methods

## Timeline
- **1 Sprint**: Participant recruitment, scheduling, and completion of moderated interviews with observation sessions

## Constraints and Considerations
- Focus limited to prescription refill and secure messaging workflows only
- Excludes end-to-end workflow testing for both use cases
- Does not include Veteran direct feedback (coordinator and call-center perspective only)
- Maintains focus on training and troubleshooting applications specifically
- Secure messaging scope limited to basic send/receive functionality, excluding advanced features

This research plan provides a focused foundation for understanding current PTA usage across two key healthcare workflows while setting the stage for more comprehensive research in subsequent phases.
