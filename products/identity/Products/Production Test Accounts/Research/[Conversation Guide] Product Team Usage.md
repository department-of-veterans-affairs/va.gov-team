## Introduction

"Hi [Name], thanks for taking the time to speak with me today. I'm [Your Name] from the Identity team, and I'm trying to better understand how product teams validate features on VA.gov.

I'm particularly interested in learning about your testing workflows - how you use production test accounts, what happens in staging versus production, and what your day-to-day process looks like when you're working on features.

This isn't an evaluation of your work - I'm trying to understand current practices so we can identify ways to better support teams like yours. Everything you share will be kept confidential, and I'll only report findings in aggregate.

Do you mind if I record this conversation for my notes? And do you have any questions before we start?"

## Warm-up & Contex

**Role & Responsibilities**
- Can you tell me about your role and what you work on day-to-day?

**Team Structure**
- Who else is on your product team?
- How do you typically collaborate with [developers/PMs] on feature validation?
- Do you have a researcher on the team?  Do they assist with usability testing, UAT, feature validation, etc?

## Current Testing Workflow

**General Process**
- Walk me through what happens after you've built a new feature or made changes to an existing one. What's your process for making sure it works correctly?
	[Do they use feature flags]?
- Can you show me [screen share] what tools or systems you use for testing?
- How is your testing structured (eg do you use test plans or check the product requirements)? 
- Are there any additional considerations you take into account when testing?
- Have you developed any unofficial processes or workarounds to make testing easier?

**Environment Usage**
- Tell me about the different environments you work with - development, staging, production, etc.
- What types of testing do you do in each environment?
- *Probe: What requires you to test in production?*

**Production Test Accounts**
- How do you use production test accounts in your workflow?
- Can you walk me through a recent example of when you used a production test account?
- *Probe: How do you access these accounts?*
- *Probe: What types of scenarios do you test with them?*
- *Probe: How do you coordinate with other team members who might need the same accounts?*

## Pain Points & Challenges 

**Current Frustrations**
- What's the most frustrating part of your current testing process?  (Are there gaps in PTAs?)
- Tell me about a time when your testing process didn't catch an issue that Veterans encountered.
- Are there features or scenarios that are particularly difficult to test?

## Confidence & Risk 

**Release Confidence**
- How confident do you typically feel when releasing features to Veterans?
- What makes you feel more or less confident about a release?
- Have you ever delayed a release because you weren't confident in your testing?
- Are there types of Veterans or use cases that are harder to account for in testing?

## Wrap-up & Future State 

**Additional Insights**
- Is there anything important about your testing workflow that we haven't covered?

## Closing
"Thank you so much for your time and insights. This has been really helpful for understanding how teams currently work. I'll be talking to several other team members over the next few weeks, and I'll make sure to share back what we learn and any recommendations that come out of this research.

Do you have any questions for me? And would it be okay if I follow up with any clarifying questions via email?"
