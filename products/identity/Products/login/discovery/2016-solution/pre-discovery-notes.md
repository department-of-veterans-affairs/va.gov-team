Product Objectives (rough notes at this point):
1. Enable veterans to create an account on Vets.gov
2. Enable veterans to verify their veteran status and identity using either DS Logon or Troop ID

Open Questions:
How do I know which LOA level I have when I go through Troop ID?


Misc. Notes:
Adding Troop ID to ID.me account: https://idme.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204456674-How-do-I-verify-my-military-service-
Need to consider a dedicated path on ID.me for Troop ID verification - not through "Earn More Cash Back" and exclusive to Troop ID
There is a disctinction between ID.me and Troop ID that needs to be considered.
