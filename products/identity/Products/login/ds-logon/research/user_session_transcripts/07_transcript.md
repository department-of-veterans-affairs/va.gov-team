*[0:13]* **M: What VA websites or applications do you access online?**

P: Um, let’s see if I get them right. MyHealtheVet, and then the other one I’m gonna have to look real quick because I just start typing and then it pops up. Um … yeah, myhealth.va.gov, and then the other one … it’s the VA benefits one. I’m so sorry, I don’t remember it. It’s the one with the blue button. I remember that. Those are the only two that I use on a regular basis anyway.

**M: That was MyHealtheVet and the VA benefits?**

P: Yes.

**M: Gotcha. And how do you log into those websites?**

*[1:42]* P: Um, well, usually typing in the website and then um clicking the accept button and logging in with user ID and password.

**M: I’m wondering if you would be comfortable screensharing with us and kind of walking us through what that process looks like.**

P: Yes, I think so if I can get in there.

**M: So the zoom application, at the bottom of that window there’s a black bar with a bunch of buttons, and there’s a green one that says share. So if you can click on that you’re able to open either, you know share your desktop or share your internet browser.**

P: Ok.

**M: And then we can follow along at home.**

P: Ok.

**M: Perfect.**

*[2:39]* P: Okay good. Okay so normally from this page I’d just log in. And then from here I’ll either view my VA appointments, um I use the blue button medical reports a lot, labs and tests especially if it’s been a couple days since we’ve had any lab work done, and then you know the blue button to see what the doctor’s notes were on the last um appointment that we had. And then refilling the VA prescriptions I usually don’t use that one very often; we usually just secure message his doctor.

**M: I noticed that you used the login option on the left hand of the screen when you first logged in. Is there a reason that you choose that one over the other options?**

P: I guess because it’s just front and center for me. I’ve never used any of the others before. I just click the login. I honestly didn’t notice that there was another way to do it.

*[4:06]* **M: No worries, that makes sense to me. Now are there VA services or benefits that you aren’t able to access online?**

P: Um, that I can’t access?

**M: That, you know, perhaps ideally you’d be able to access but you aren’t able to.**

P: Um, it would be nice to actually see the images from x-rays and MRIs. We usually have to go to the release of information office to obtain those either on CD. So it would be nice to have access to those here. And if it is available, I have no idea how to get to it.

**M: I’m wondering if we could you know go to the other website that you say you use regularly and see what that login process is like.**

P: Sure.

*[5:35]* **M: I saw there you chose the MyHealtheVet option again. Is that for the same reason on the previous website?**

P: Yes it is. That’s the only way I know how to log in. I’ve never used the other options.

**M: Gotcha. Do you recall you know how you got this MyHealtheVet login account set up?**

P: Well years ago he actually did it and then I just kind of took over for him. So I honestly don’t know -- it was honestly probably through a google search. That’s how we found most of our, most of the websites, most of the information, is by googling. Um, very little information has actually come from the VA itself. I use a lot of forums, um Facebook groups, that helps me learn how to navigate, how to find certain things, YouTube videos. I’m just kind of navigating--

**M: So--**

P: Sorry, go ahead.

*[7:01]* **M: No, no worries. So I noticed when you were logging in that there was an option to you know send a code to a cell phone or a secondary thing. I’m wondering if you could tell me a little bit about that.**

P: Okay, um that actually hasn’t popped up in a while. I was just on last week and it didn’t ask me that. Um, so we have his phone set up to send the text message to. Um, I’m guessing it’s just a security thing. It hasn’t asked me that in a while.

**M: Yeah, and I’m wondering what you think about that, you know? You mention that it’s a security thing. Is that something that’s important to you folks? Being able to you know kind of have that secondary level of proof that it’s you?**

P: Yeah, um, normally we log in on our phones, so it’s possible that because it was from the computer, so something new, you know it didn’t recognize the IP address or something. So I feel better about it. He’s not too concerned because he thinks his information is already out there. I try to protect it as much as possible, so I like that extra added security. But normally this page, he accesses from his phone. 

*[8:40]* **M: I’m wondering, have you folks you know ever worked with a VCO or a VCO representative to kind of navigate these sites and set up these accounts?**

P: No, we have not. Um, we actually had a VC-- VSO when we were in Texas, uh we were moved back to Arkansas and he basically emailed me forms, said fill this out, send it back, um and that was the only communication I ever had with him. Um we actually talked to Dave in Little Rock, and they never mentioned any help with navigating these websites at all. But I think that it would probably be very beneficial because you know I’ve seen here, get medical records, view labs, schedule, so this is kind of informative if I knew more how to use it better. It’s just not all there. He says that he does use this website, but a lot of the information isn’t uploaded so it’s not current. A lot of stuff is missing.

**M: Gotcha. And when you said you were working with somebody in Texas and you emailed them forms, was that for setting up this account?**

P: Um, it didn’t have anything to do with this website. We were just trying to get some help with disability claims, so he was you know emailing forms that he needed for us to sign so that he could submit it on our behalf.

**M: Gotcha. Now have there ever been instances where you weren’t able to log in successfully with your MyHealtheVet account?**

P: Mhm.

**M: I’m sorry I think I may have missed that, was that a yes?**

P: Yes.

*[10:47]* **M: Gotcha. And what have you, you know how often does that happen and what do you do when that happens?**

P: Well, I would say probably weekly. Once a week. Um and then I just get on the phone and-- which is very difficult to get ahold of them because they’re there at 7 in the morning and they leave at 3:30. To try to reach them is very difficult. So I just continue to try throughout the day, um or wait to the next day. 

**M: Gotcha. I’m wondering if you could you know kind of play around with me here. Um if we were to log out and then log back in I’m curious what you think of some of the other options there are for logging in.**

P: Okay sure. You want me to just go to home?

**M: Yeah, that should reset it. Let’s see what that does.**

P: It still has me logged in.

**M: No worries. Perhaps we can go to a different website as well. Give me one second. I can drop a link for that in the chat.**

P: Awesome.

**M: So at the bottom of the screen you should see a little chat bubble that has turned orange. So you can pull up that and then if we just do the screensharing again with that link we’ll be able to see as you move through that website.**

*[12:58]* P: You folks can see?

**M: Yeah I am. So is this a website that you’ve ever used?**

P: Yes, yes it is. Just not as often.

**M: How often would you use this website?**

P: Um, honestly, I only use this one a couple times a year, and it’s usually to pull up his VA compensation letter, um, you know for certain people who need it and the criteria they need to see, check his percentage, you know make sure nothing has changed. So I don’t use this one as often. But when I do I just click login up at the top. Unless you want me to do something else?

**M: No that’s perfect, yeah imagine you’re coming here to get that letter or…**

P: Okay. And usually it’s very difficult to navigate. So I have to refer back to some notes that I have saved to remember how to find it. I guess I just don’t log in enough to find the benefits letter. I really don’t like this website as well. It seems so … not to sound repetitive, but difficult.

**M: Like I mentioned, no opinions, I won’t be offended by anything.**

P: It’s like okay, so here’s the letter generator, okay, so now go here…

**M: What exactly about this website is it that you find difficult?**

P: I guess maybe it could be overwhelming, all the options, because I know like there’s the benefits summary, and then the benefits verification, so sometimes trying to figure out which one I’m needing, which one has the information… um you know for the organization or whatever that’s needing the letter. And then I have updated my contact information, um...

**M: Do you recall um what the process of setting up this account was like?**

P: Mmmm, I don’t think it was too difficult. If I remember correctly they may have had to mail something to us with a code because it was so long ago I don’t know if you know cell phones, if they were using them to send codes. It seems like we had to wait to receive something in the mail so it could take some time. But again that was so long ago. I mean you know 2010, 2011, but still. So much has changed.

**M: Almost a decade ago at this point.**

P: Yeah!

**M: Do you remember you know besides them mailing the code if you had to do any other sort of identity proofing, identity verification for that account?**

P: I don’t think so. Besides you know putting in your social and birthday, as normal. I honestly can’t remember. I’m so sorry.

**M: Oh no worries, no worries. It seemed like, you know, that you were able to get in pretty easily. We’ve heard from others and I’m wondering if this is your experience as well, that, you know, are there instances where the login for eBenefits is down or you’re not able to access it?**

*[17:06]* P: Oh yes, it has happened on this website. Um, like I said I don’t use this one as often, but sometimes you know an error times out or something, the website is down, and then I’ll just wait and come back the next day and try again kind of thing. Um, it seems like I was trying to get on a couple weeks ago, or maybe a week ago, and it did that to me like all day long, and he was even having problems logging in from his phone, so we just kind of gave up for the day.

**M: And when you give up for the day, you know, what are your next steps? Do you just kind of wait it out and try it another time?**

P: Yes, usually um if I have time, depending on my day I’ll come back later on and check, um, if I can check throughout the day I will, but normally we just say, oh it’s the VA, and try again the next day. 

**M: So I’m wondering if you could kind of walk me through what you’re, what you’re searching for here. I see you clicking around on the website.**

P: I just thought I would click and see what’s here. I know we have done the direct deposit information. This is how we um … yes, this is where we update it for our checking account, for compensation. Um, and then I know I’ve done this before too, the VA payment history. But that’s been a really long time since I’ve done that one. So like I said it may be because I don’t use this one as often I don’t know what is available on here, but it does seem kind of daunting. All of the information that’s here, it takes a while to figure out where to go for what you need.

**M: Yeah, that makes sense. Now, which of these websites that we’ve looked at today do you tend to log into the most?**

*[19:32]* P: Um, probably, I don’t know if you can see if I switch over to VA.gov.

**M: Yeah, we can see that.**

P: Okay, I think this is the one we use the most. And it’s either for secure messaging, because like I said trying to get ahold of them on the phone, and even his doctor has mentioned you know it’s faster to just secure message us because it goes straight to his nurse because she can review it and talk to the doctor if necessary, or just to you know refill the subscription or something. So I think secure messaging on VA.gov. And then I have also spent … I scheduled appointments via the secure messaging as well. I’ve never actually used this one right here. So again it seems like secure messaging for our VA is faster than trying to talk to someone or trying to navigate through here.

**M: Makes sense. So I’m wondering if we can pick back up on our experiment earlier. So if you log out of the VA.gov website -- and we may need to close this browser and bring it back up. Gotcha, and if we went to that sign in button again...**

P: Okay.

**M: I’m wondering, you know, what would it look like if you chose the first option here?**

P: Okay. Aha, so we haven’t used this.

*[21:49]* **M: Yeah, tell me a little bit more about what you’re seeing there.**

P: Um, confirming your email address. So they send an email to his email, and find the verification-- the confirmation email that they sent… and then either click the button in the email or enter the six-digit code. So it seems like this is um another security step, which if it does this to me every time I will say I will get very annoyed with it, um but maybe since this is the first time I’ve used it or it’s a long time I’m okay with it, but if it becomes a weekly thing I would probably be very irritated.

**M: Yeah, tell me more about that. Why would that be irritating?**

P: Um, time consuming I guess. Because being, you know, a mom, a caregiver, usually if I’m logging in I need to see something immediately or send a message, you know I don’t have a whole lot of time on my hands and if it takes up to ten minutes to receive this email, in ten minutes I may be outside or up the road, you know? Um so I think I would find it irritating if I had to do this every time. It seems kind of pointless. You should know me. This is my computer. I mean I could understand if you know if he was logging in from his phone for the first time, or my phone, but if it’s the same computer that we don’t share, it’s our personal computer, seeing this every day … I don’t need that additional security. 

*[23:48]* **M: Yeah, that makes sense to me. So it kind of sounds like time is always important, I totally get that--**

P: Oh yeah!

**M: And it kind of sounds like you make these choices based on you know what is easiest to get into and if on this--**

P: Right

**M: --that’s MyHealtheVet, that’s the choice you make. Does that kind of capture what you were saying?**

P: Yes, exactly.

**M: Gotcha. Great, well we’ve been moving pretty quickly through this, so thank you so much for--**

P: You’re welcome, I guess I’m not very opinionated.

**M: No, this has been great. Seeing you walk through these processes and the choices that you’re making and why you’re making those choices is really--**

P: Oh, okay, okay. We like short and sweet, we want to get to the point. I want to get in and get out.

**M: I get that, time is critical.**

P: Yes, yes, just now my little toddler comes in and says he’s going to build a fort, and I was like okay! Go go go!

**M: Yeah, so, just a couple of other questions here and then we can close out and I can give you some more time back of your day. You know you mentioned security is something that’s important to you, but, you know, not if it’s kind of too burdensome. So I’m wondering, you know, based on the couple of different accounts and types of logins that we looked at today, what is your level of trust with these, and does that kind of play into how you choose which ones to use?**

*[25:23]* P: I know I kind of bit myself there. Um, I guess it’s just it’s habit. You know, that’s how he did it, so that’s how I do it. Um, to log in, um some of them like this, he still hasn’t received the email, so I would still be sitting here, so I would honestly probably click out of this and go back to the way I normally log in because at this point being a VA website I tend to feel that it’s more secure and I know my computer is secure, maybe I would feel differently if I was using you know a public computer at a library or something. But I feel like if it’s the same IP address every time I log in, you shouldn’t continually need to ask me to confirm who I am and why I’m trying to log in.

**M: Yeah, that makes sense to me. So this is kind of a fun question, a little bit out of left field, but um I’m wondering you know if I gave you a magic wand and there were something you could change about this process of either setting up the accounts or logging in, what would you change?**

P: Um, I would almost say it would be nice if I could log in. I don’t know if that’s a possibility right now because I’ve never tried. Being a caregiver it would be nice to have my own login to kind of see you know message sending, you know who he’s talking to, the doctors, whatever he’s saying, because memory loss is terrible, so a lot of times I have to ask him have you done this? Have you done this? So that I can kind of see what the doctors are saying or doing. And then the information, kind of like my own little VA website for caregivers that has information for us that we can take advantage of that I don’t know if it’s available.

**M: Gotcha. So you know typically are you logging in or is your partner logging in to you know check on the doctors’ messages or what has or hasn’t been done?**

P: Um it’s usually me. I try to be proactive. He just gets angry. So it’s me. Squeaky wheel gets the grease, you know? “Call us” and I call in the morning and um [audio breaks up] I wasn’t able to kind of, you know still couldn’t get an answer from them so finally I just started secure messaging them through his account um and then we finally got an answer and got his appointment for the following week. So had I been able to get ahold of them you know we could have had that follow-up appointment faster because it was kind of necessary but that’s just … that’s just the VA, that’s just what we say. They do things on their own time.

**M: I want to circle back on your idea of you know having a caregiver login. I’m wondering you know what sort of benefits you see that that could bring for you. Why that’s interesting to you.**

P: Um, I know that there are a lot of programs out there, there’s a lot of information out there, like in regards to assistance, different research programs, or even like telehealth, but it’s so spread out, you know you have to go to this website to see if you can talk to someone, or you have to go to this website you know to sign up for retreats or … it would be nice if there was a website that kind of compiled all of that, um instead of us trying to research it or you know a friend, another caregiver saying oh hey here’s this on this website, you know this is a great organization, call them email them text them you know kind of thing. It would be nice if it was just all in a website just for caregivers. And as far as I know that’s not available to us yet.

**M: Gotcha. So kind of you know like what you said, like a caregiver’s version of the VA, and a community of resources that caregivers might need.**

P: Yes, absolutely.

**M: Makes sense.**

*[30:30]* P: Because I learn new stuff every day and like I said I’m in a wonderful wonderful facebook group and they have years and years of knowledge. Um and the one lady who I talked with, she actually referred me to you guys and she caregives for her dad and he’s a World War II veteran, and she’s just a plethora of knowledge. I can just pick her brain anytime, but I also know that she has to take care of her dad so she’s not available 24/7 even though she tries to be -- she’s super sweet. So it would be nice to log in at night and be able to talk to somebody and be like I can’t sleep because I’m so worried about this, you know, where can I go what can I do, so I usually just utilize the facebook group honestly for all of that.

**M: I think that’s an excellent idea and that brings up you know the priorities and you know concerns that caregivers have that we haven’t heard about yet so that’s really useful to hear, thank you.**

P: Yes.

**M: So I just have a couple of final questions. Is there anything that we haven’t talked about today that you think I should know?**

P: Um, no I think you addressed the concerns that we have with the logging in, like, I don’t know how long we’ve been waiting but I still don’t have this email.

**M: I noticed it’s still spinning, yes.**

P: It is. Um, but I can’t think of anything off the bat. Other than it is difficult to navigate and I know I keep saying that but it could just be I need to sit down one day for a couple hours and just click through everything and see what’s there.

**M: Right, I’m sure there’s many days that you have a couple hours to just dedicate to that.**

P: Right! And I guess also because here’s the VA.gov, this is what’s available on here, here’s MyHealtheVet, this is what’s available on here, maybe if that was combined into one that would be a little easier but it would probably be super overwhelming.

**M: Great. So just one last question: do you have any questions or closing thoughts for me?**

P: Um, no. I’ve enjoyed my time with you. I hope I’ve helped.

**M: This has been very helpful. We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is helpful as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for veterans.**

P: Good! Good.

**M: Lastly if you know any other veterans, caregivers, others who you think would be interested or willing in participating in something like we did today in the future, let us know and when we follow up with you we can send any information to pass onto them.**

P: Okay great!

**M: Perfect. Okay well thank you so much, I hope you enjoy the rest of your day, and please thank your husband for his service on our behalf.**

P: I sure will, thank you.

**M: Have a great day.**

P: You too, bubye.

**M: Bye.**
