*[moderator reads opening script]*

*[00:14]* **M: What VA websites or applications do you access online?**

P: I access Ebenefits, DS Logon, and DEERS online, and MyHealtheVet.Thank you [name], My husband is in the bathroom telling me, and MyHealtheVet, yes, I access all those online. 

**M: Ok. And DEERS, I haven’t heard of that one before, can you tell me a little more about that one?**

P: Yeah, DEERS, is like, I don’t know, hey [name] might have to help me explain what it’s associated with. I logged onto DEERS, cause [name] and I got married...It’s a thing where you get to log on and you can see who has access to what. You go down to the DEERS center to get your military ID, and you get to see who has access and can make decisions on your behalf. It has to do with military information. But it DEERS. D-E-E-R-S. I don’t know what it stands for.

**M: So eBenefits and myhealthevet, how are you logging into those? Do you know what accounts you use for those?**

P: Yeah yeah, no we log into them with, we were logging in with ID.me, but like, I go to ebenefits.VA and we log in. But like lately, we were trying to login the other day and they were doing a whole, like thorough, they were having to authenticate each veteran. *[P reads disclaimer from the DS Logon online remote proofing security warning]*

P: So I usually go down and you click the eBenefits consent to monitor. And I log in with the DS Logon. Are you asking what the DS Logon user name is?

**M: I don’t need that information specifically. But I’m wondering if I could send you a link, if you would be comfortable screen sharing?**

P: Yeah for sure *[speaks with husband]*, he might need to come out and help me. 

*[moderator helps P set up screen sharing]

[Participant pulls up Myhealth.va.gov]*

*[6:41]* P: Ok, so usually I go to, oh there’s two login buttons, that’s different [loading error on site - buttons were duplicated]. So, I need to find, uh, this one, *[clicks into MHV login box]* and we’ll see if we have...or we can sign in with DS Logon, that might be better.

**M: Yeah, walk me through that decision right there, are there times when you use one or the other?**

P: I usually sign in with the DS Logon because that’s the one I have saved in my phone. So when I go in and I log in on stuff for my husband’s account, I’ll go to my iPhone and I go to my passwords, I usually have all of my passwords in my notes, ok. So I can go in and go, ok, myhealthevet login is [username] and my password is this. But, since we’ve been having issues with logging in, we’ve had to change it. So I don’t know the login right now. So that’s the biggest headache I get. And he as well, when we change our passcodes, our passwords, and we don’t inform each other of it. So that’s why I chose to come over here [ds logon], because he knows what this is.[clicks login to ds logon button]

*[8:00]* P: So this is some craziness. I don’t know what this is all about. We have a premium DS Logon, so..and let’s just see if this works. Ok. *[enters username/password]*. Yep, it’s saying it’s not [error 11 on screen]...Hey [husband’s name]!

**M: Yeah, so tell me what you think is happening here? Is this something that you folks see often?**

P: Um, so what’s going on here, the other day we got a letter from the VA, from the education coordinator for [name], cause [name]’s thinking about going back to school. So [name] oftentimes, he’ll forget his logins and his passwords, so he’ll recreate new ones. So, we..this is a situation where I need to know his password because we know his login but I don’t know his password cause he changed it recently. So let me message him..

**M: How frequently do you need to change your passwords for DS Logon?**

P: We haven’t had to change it for a really long time. But he did change it recently because we got the letter from the VA...password and username...[calls to husband, waits]

P: This is the struggle. 

**M: No worries, this is a great insight into the process.**

P: [calls for husband again]. Ok, do you mind if I go grab him real quick?

**M: Not a problem.**

*[10:55]* P: Ok… here’s coming down, he’s putting our son down. 

**M: Oh no worries.**

P: Yeah, we need your phone and we need your login, sweetheart. Ok, what is the password?

Husband: [reads off password]. Is that for eBenefits?

P: We’re on myhealthevet, right?

**M: Yeah, that’s what we’re looking at right now. And, we don’t necessarily need to login and see everything, but this is just understanding the process is pretty great so far.**

P: So yeah, this is the process, this is our life. It’s a shit show. Cause I’m always changing passcodes, and he’s always changing passcodes. I was telling her about how like we got the letter and we were trying to log in, and how they have to identify everyone. So now we’re all collaboratively here together. So do you want me to log in or do you not want me to log in?

**M: If you’re comfortable doing that that’s great. As you do this, in this instance, where a passcode is changed..I’d love to understand if, you know, say [name] isn’t there, how do you go about figuring out, or resetting..?**

P: I would go into the password recovery, but here’s the deal. [name] and I met in 2016, so a lot of the questions that they ask, the recovery questions, like what’s your sister’s middle name, or what town did you get your first job in, we think we're answering the questions correctly but we’re not, so we get locked out. So we also got locked out as well. So that would be my first go to for recovery questions. But you know what would be awesome, instead of doing recovery questions, like you guys could send a code to a phone, like an approved phone, and make it much simpler. Cause otherwise you get locked out, and what if you’re having an emergency or you need to get in? Like what if [name] was in the hospital and I needed to access his information but I couldn’t because I didn’t know [name’s] middle name? Like if there would be another way to pre-verify someone, as being, yes they’re on my list and yes you can send them a code, and that would trump all the other stuff and they could get in. As a caretaker and a caregiver, it’s important for me to be able to access his information quickly, and if this website is going to mess around and not allow me to, it’s frustrating to me. It actually pisses me off.

**M: Yeah, absolutely.**

*[13:42]* Husband:  And on top of that, too, I don’t know if you would cover this whole thing, when you get the [inaudible], it just tells you have an appointment, not necessarily you’re sure if it’s in [city] or [city] or where it’s at.

P: Yeah that’s a huge one! Like the VA appointment reminders! Do you want to give [name] a rundown of what you’re trying to cover today, cause there’s so much we could tell you.

*[Moderator gives husband background on goal of the call, looking at DS Logon]*

*[14:24]* Husband: Oh, it’s [DS Logon] a pain in the butt. 

P: Yeah, and she’s totally open to your opinions and she’s not going to judge you for them.

**M: Yeah. So tell me a little bit more about what that…**

Husband: And then the fact that suddenly you get an email, and you have to reset your email, [inaudible], password after so long, and then you know. I don’t remember anything, quite frankly,

P: Yeah, vets come with traumatic brain injuries, they have PTSD, and all of these things are really hard for them. So like, you have to have a masters or PhD in DS Logon even just to use it. So the ease of use is really hard. So caregivers are the ones having to do all this, but we don’t know half the history of our vets sometimes, and we get locked out. And it’s like, well shit, we can’t use the DS Logon, and the vets get upset because have to change the username and passcode, and it just becomes this circle jerk of anger. So it’s like..if there could be an approved person on file that could have an approved phone number, and there could be a three or four digit code from that person’s phone, and it could just get reset, that would be so much simpler than just answering questions and getting a state test and getting certified. I mean, it’s just insane.

Husband: For me, I do a lot of stuff, almost everything from my phone cause I hate computers. I’m kind of a technology retard, quite frankly. And then, I have to store all my passwords in my phone. And they’re like, done by my face, I guess, when I log in [facial recognition], and then when I have to change a password it don’t always update it in the thing, so then it’s like, ok, what did I do with my password? And half the time, you know, if you don’t put a space bar in the question, I don’t remember? My first dog, did I put my first dog I owned as an adult, or did I do my first dog as a kid?

P: It’s complicated is what he’s trying to say, it’s super complicated.

**M: Yeah, I does sound like there’s a lot of little things that can trip you up. I’m wondering, you know, as a caregiver, how do you set up accounts? Do you get to set up a separate account, how does that factor into setting up [name’s] account?**

P: I don’t set up accounts. I came into the picture after [name] was medically retired, so he has all this stuff already set up. I just access it. So when I have something like, oh my gosh, I need to access this particular thing, I go to [name] and say “hey, I want to make an honor wall for you and I need to find out what medals you have so I can create this honor wall for you”. And then he has to go “ok, well, let me think where you would do that at, and he gives me the logins” and that’s taken a couple of years to get all those in and down. So now I pretty much have all the logins available except when they get changed. So I haven’t had to set up anything, really.

Husband: Why isn’t myhealthevet and eBenefits the same thing?

P: Yeah, so the DS Logon, that’s supposed to cover everybody and everything right?

Husband: But they’re different though.

**M: Would it be useful to go to eBenefits and kind of talk me through how those are different?**

*[18:21]* Husband: Well the logins are completely different. They don’t even talk as a system. you can’t go from one system to the other. So it’s like, ok, now I gotta remember two user names and two passwords.

P: But if you use the DS Logon isn’t that..

Husband: No it’s not the same, they’re both different?

P: Oh shit, really? Yeah let’s go to ebenefits, let’s do this.

**M: Yeah [name], do you have a count, perhaps of how many different login accounts you need to remember and manage for VA?**

Husband: I have eBenefits and myhealthevet.

P: [pulls up ebenefits site] Ok, so logging in...Ok. So then here’s the Consent to Monitor, we do this [clicks checkbox], we go to the DS Login. So what’s this one?

Husband: That one’s different?

P: So can you look it up on your phone love? And maybe we can chat later about what it is so I can have it on my phone as well?

[inaudible background conversation]

Husband: I’m trying to find it, maam.

**M: Oh no worries, and if you aren’t able to find it that’s totally ok, we can just talk through, you know.**

Husband: Let me go through my phone…

P: This is another thing, we access this to get, like, VA letters or stuff like that. 

Husband: I think this will work…

P: Yeah, there it is. Do you have more questions? You can ask questions…

**M: This has been really useful.**

P: I feel like this has been a total shit show but if this helps, that’s all that matters.

Husband: Yeah, my phone doesn’t even have this one.

P: This is our problem.

**M: How do you store it on a phone? When you say you put it in your phone, what does that mean?**

P: The iphone automatically asks if you want to store this password, and sometimes it’ll say, sometimes it’ll store it and sometimes it won’t even store it. So that’s why I’m saying, if there was a straight up legit, umbrella login, as it were, and I think that the DS is supposed to be that umbrella login for the vets, so that it’s one straight across the board. If there were an umbrella login that had the ability to assign a caregiver, and maybe a backup caregiver in the case of an emergency, with that code. And, shit, you could make them go down and do blood tests, and make that caregiver give through [inaudible] government background, clear them with the highest security clearance, just so they could have that dang code, that would be so much more helpful. By the time that I need to get some information, by the time I’ve got the information I need, I am so pissed so frustrated and just so over it, that I get it, and then I’m in a mad mood for like four hours afterwards, because it is so difficult sometimes. 

P: [speaking with husband about password]..So now we don’t even know, right? We don’t even know, Lauryl.

**M: How long would you say it usually takes you folks to log in? You mentioned, you know, the process is really long and it can be frustrating.**

Husband: We have to wait cause it’ll lock us out for 24 hours.

P: 48 hours

**M: Ok**

P: And I’m pretty computer savvy. I’m not like, a 13 year old kids these days, but I’m pretty up to date on stuff and I know what I’m doing. But even this is so complicated and hard that it’s like, it’s a pain in the ass. 

*[22:47]* **M: Yeah, you mentioned, you know, a text message or a code that goes to a phone, I’m wondering you know, after say you were able to log in here, after you log in, are there, do you ever see different screens where you know it’ll ask you to add a code or something like that?**

P: Honestly, no, I haven’t. And even if it did, I’m so pissed off and thank god I got in I hope my computer doesn’t die, I just want to get in and get out. I don’t ever just sit and browse.I get in, get out, and get what I need and move on. We also have four kids. I don’t have time to sit here and mess around. Sometimes we need letters, we need information, I need to see when appointments are happening. It’s just like, it’s hard. I’m just whining I’m sorry.

**M: This is all really useful information for us.**

P: It’s hard, Lauryl. Help me, I’m poor.

**M: Yeah, I can totally understand how feeling that you aren’t able to get into these services because of something like a password is really…**

Husband: [talks about password/username]

P: Let’s see if it works! Nope! See, this is what we do…

Husband: I think it’s one that just [inaudible].

P: This is the fun game that we do. Anyway, it’s just a shit show.

**M: When this would happen, you get this error, what do you do next?**

P: Um..Well I would go back up and click the Consent box and try again. And maybe I would go to…[asks husband about username]...Ok, let’s try that one. Ok. 

Husband: No, just use the password [the autosaved password on the browser]

P: Ok let’s try that, and then we would go down and it would say….No, “did you forget your password”. Then I would that one *[tries another saved password]*, and I would try this one up here..and then...but is it the [password option]?

Husband: I don’t know, try that

P: Ok let’s try that, and then I would do that, and it would say no. And then I’d say well shit I’m not doing that right now I need to go change a diaper or feed someone, I’ll do it later. And that’s the roundabout, that’s what it is. Or I would message [name] or text him in a bitchy tone and say what’s your login and he would say I don’t know you probably changed it and then we would argue. Right? 

**M: So [name] I’m wondering, could you talk to me a little about what you had to do originally when you set up these accounts and what that process was like?**

Husband: I don’t know, I was still just barely out of the hospital when these were set up.

P: His ex-wife set them up.

Husband: I was still in the Polytrauma part of the VA. I got out on the [hospital?] and I was still doing a lot of treatment for my head injury stuff.

**M: Gotcha. And did you have any of these sort of online accounts before you were medically discharged, when you were still active duty?**

*[26:57]* Husband: I think towards the end of active duty, but I still had a CAC card, so I could get in with my CAC card.

**M: Gotcha.**

Husband: and then it was only, you know I could just use an old phone number on my CAC card as a password. So that was all I needed to do.

P: That would be so simple, can I have a CAC card Lauryl?

Husband: The VA really should go to a CAC card system, rather than what they have now. And then, you know, people have CAC card readers or whatever for their computers. And then you can get on. And then the dependents should have a CAC card as well. Who’s to say I don’t get in a really bad car accident.

P: Exactly, oh my gosh, yes. And then where am I left? I’m left with nothing and the inability to login with anything, and I’m screwed. 

**M: Yeah…**

P: Yeah. And I have like, I just went to a caregiver retreat in [city], and they gave me a whole booklet, and it even has a section for logins and passwords for all of [name]’s account, a section for burial, a section for medals. If I had to drop everything in a heartbeat and leave this house with food on the stove, this is the bible that I would pass on to friends and family, who would come and take care of my house and it would have everything in it. But if those passcodes aren’t up to date or the DS Logon is acting up, they’re not going to be able to get into this information for me. You know, it needs to be streamlined and it needs to be a sure thing. Otherwise, why does it even exist you know? Maybe it’s user error on our part, Maybe we need to get our lives together and we’re fucking irresponsible. But at the same time, I write down every password I have. [name’s] not going into change his passwords to fuck with me or anyone else. It just seems like everytime we go to login to shit that has to do with military, and especially the DS Logon, it’s always a chore. It’s like, argh, we have to do this today, great. It’s like sitting in the social security office, no one wants to do that right? Or go to the dentist, like who wants to do that, right?

**M: Yeah, I have a dentist appointment on friday so I feel you.**

P: I’m sorry!

**M: You folks mentioned, you're pretty tech savvy, this is something you feel should be easy. I’m wondering, compared to other online accounts you’ve set up…**

*[29:45]* P: I feel like I need to have a bachelor's degree in computer sciences in order to be able to access the DS Logon. Like, if you gave me a scale of zero to like, organic chem, this is about organic chem. 

Husband: And then you try to save your like, your VA letter to your desktop, and then it saves it as a website rather than as a…

P: PDF or whatever..

Husband: Yeah, so now you gotta go to the website and you gotta go through everything again.  We don’t have printers, we just try to do..

P: We try to do everything electronically with our phone, like we go on retreats and they wanna see a VA letter to prove that [name] was in the military, so we go onto this thing and try to get the latest generated letter, or if we need to refinance our car, or show proof of income for state benefits, or anything like that, it’s a hot mess. 

Husband: Quite frankly I don’t want to deal with it at any of the time. Cause I know how much of a headache it is, and it puts me in a bad mood.

P: Yeah, I was telling her that earlier. It takes us like an hour to get shit done. And occasionally, like, occasionally, maybe twice a year, it’ll work right. But all the rest of it, it just seems like it’s a headache. We take the same steps every time, and some times it’s like welcome, here’s all your information. And other times, it’s like fuck you, I’m going to make it a 72 hour process and you’re going to have to give up your firstborn in order to get into the DS Logon website.

**M: So the inconsistency is really frustrating?**

P: Yeah, it’s excruciating! And I don’t want to go to my vet, my warrior, and bother him. He doesn’t want to be bothered. So do I go to him: Is today the day I can ask him or not? Cause some days are better than others, too, Lauryl. It’s just really hard.

Husband: On top of that I don’t ever sleep, you know, so you never know, I don’t ever know, one minute I might be fine and the next…

**M: How often are you folks trying to login? You said twice a year it’ll work and the rest of the time it doesn’t?**

P: We try to log in probably four times a month, maybe? We were trying to refinance our car, then we tried to log in because we got a letter for education benefits, then [name’s] ex wife is a psycho so we had to get her out of there and change things, we’re in a child custody battle so we… *[frustrated conversation about child and dog and nap time]*

P: See that, that what just happened, is kind of part of the frustration of the DS Logon, and it kind of like, that’s where it goes in real life. 

**M: Yeah, I know we scheduled for like 45 minutes, so we did start a little early.**

P: We’re fine! We can still talk, he’s just going to go upstairs, he doesn’t want to come back down and talk about it though.

**M: No worries.**

P: I can still chat though.

**M: No worries, we just have a couple of more questions anyways, so I want to move on. I think you’ll like this next one. Imagine if I could give you a magic wand and you could change something about this process, what would you change?**

P: I would just change it so that there’s one type of login, not a million different kinds, and I would change it so that that login could be accessed even if I forgot the login name and username, that I could put in a phone number and that phone number could be a trusted number, and you guys could send me a code that would automatically let me access the information, and change the information. And it would send a code, or the updated login/username and password to [name’s] phone, because he’s phone would also be in the system and it would update us both. And it would save that information in the system so that if [name] tried to login, he would automatically have it and it wouldn’t be this back and forth what’s the passcode what’s the login, so that we could just have it be done you know. Boom.

**M: It sounds like if you have to change passwords a lot, the problem of keeping them synced up, especially if there’s multiple people logging in..**

*[34:40]* P: Yeah it’s hard, it’s really hard. Even if you guys...Sometimes there’s a code generation, like a code generator app that you can get, you know..that they automatically verify you. Even that, just something, to make it a shorter process, would be amazing. 

**M:Yeah, I think those are all really excellent ideas and give us a lot of room to think about areas for improvement.**

P:Thanks man.

**M: Is there anything that we haven't talked about today that you think I should know about? You know, what we’ve looked at or already gone over?**

P: Not that I can think of, it’s basically just the log in process, it’s just that. And I think that, CAC card thing, is a really, an awesome idea. It might not be as cost-efficient as a code that could be sent out..but just simplicity, simplifying the process. Keeping in mind that veterans are not like civilian people. They come back from war, they come back from being enlisted, and they have issues. They have limitations. Not that they’re not capable of functioning in the world and raising children and being amazing individuals, but they do have limits. And sometimes those limits they cap at a lower rate than a civilians would cap at because of what they've been through and seen. So just ease of use, and making it so it’s not just a cluster-fuck of crazy would be so incredible. And I think that you guys would see a lot more utilization of this particular...and I don’t know if people do utilize this as much as they could or would if were just simpler. And to add on top of that, all veterans aren’t like, [age] years old like [name], a lot of them are way older as well. So if they have to access this information, they would need a caregiver to help them do that. They would need someone to walk them through this process. So maybe even a hotline that they could call easily, with big numbers, and someone would pick up the phone right away and help them, like, yes, let me help you do this, let me send you a code, let’s get into your account, that would be incredible. 

**M: Do you know if there’s any sort of resource like a help desk, or a place to find answers to those questions?**

P: I know there’s a resource, I just called, it’s at the White house, it’s a white house phone number and it’s specifically for VA, for VA questions. But I don’t know if they’d be able to access DS Logon information and help with that. But I do know I called this number because it had to be bullshit. I saw it on facebook. That’s like getting resources from the huffington post, it’s not reliable. I called it and the chick picked up right away and said, yeah, this is what I can do for you. And she gave me the number to help get [name’s] medals for his honor wall. So it was legit and she was awesome. But a lot of the questions I asked her she referred me out to other phone numbers. But that’s all I know about. 

**M: Awesome, that’s good to know.**

P: Yeah it’s awesome, I don’t know if you have the phone number or not, I can probably get you it if you want it anyway, it’s all over facebook. It’s the VA hotline directly to the white house. 

**M: I think that’s all the questions we had for you, do you have any questions for me?**

P: No, not really. I feel like we just had a counseling session, thank you.

**M: As long as it went well for you I’m happy.**

P: I appreciate that, Lauryl. I should pay you..

**M: Oh no, no worries.**

*[38:34]* P: You got to hear the little fight about it. That’s the real shit there, that frustration that you heard in [name’s] voice, that’s the real shit, that’s the trenches of trying to deal with this online stuff. Especially with your veteran. Like, I love that man to death, and he gets frustrated with it, and then it creates frustration between our relationship. That’s also something to consider, we’re just trying to help out and they’re frustrated. Anyways, it’s just a thing. 

**M: Absolutely.**

P: All right dude.

**M: Yeah again, thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts, this has been really helpful.**

*[closing script]*
