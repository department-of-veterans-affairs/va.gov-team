*[moderator reads opening script]*

**M: What VA websites or applications do you use online?**

P: I use the va.gov and myhealthevet and also eBenefits.

**M: And how do you login to each of those websites?**

P: Well myhealthevet I use theirs, eBenefits I use the DS Login I’m pretty sure that’s all it allows me. And then the va.gov, sometimes I’ll the DS Login sometimes I’ll use the Id.me.


**M: What helps you decide to use DS Logon or ID.me on va.gov?**

*[1:00]* P: Usually it’s just what computer I’m on. If it’s a public computer I’ll use Id.me

**M: Interesting, is there a particular reason for that?**

P: Just because it uses your email address not your username.

**M: Gotcha. Are there any VA services or benefits that you need access to but you’re unable to access online?**

P: You’re talking about all VA systems?

**M: Yeah, anything that comes to mind.**

P: You know their online appointment maker for the veterans health administration is nothing close to what it should be. It shouldn’t be that hard.

**M: What part of it are you finding troublesome?**

P: It just take a while, you go on and request it and then they tell you later on if you actually got it. Whether, then being able to just pick a slot, you know. Also, it’s fairly narrow, it’s less than 90 days or 60 days or something like that. You go to the doctor and they say come back in 6 months, but you can’t make that appointment in 6 months you know.


**M: So, you talked about a couple of different login accounts, I’m wondering do you remember how you set those up? How did you get those login accounts and could you walk me through that process?**

P: Oh that’s a good question. The first one would’ve been myhealthevet, right..So let me go to MHV real quick. I’m pretty sure this would’ve been years ago, right. I’m pretty sure they just sent me a letter, you know you’re enrolled in VA healthcare, if you want to you can sign up for MHV. It’s been a while, I’m guessing that’s how I did it. In fact, it’s probably been 15 years or something like that. Over ten. 

**M: And for DS Logon or ID.me, do you recall that process?**

P: For some reason I’m thinking with eBenefits I had to request a login and they mailed it to me. It’s entirely possible, it’s been a while. I first got service connected over 6 years ago. It’s entirely possible, when they said ok you’re service connected now you can go ahead and set up this ebenefits account. I can’t remember for sure. I can probably actually go in there and see when I first set it up if you want.

**M: Sure and that’s actually a good segway for the screensharing if that’s something that you’re comfortable with.**

P: Yeah come on in.

*[moderator helps set up screen share]*

**M: Perfect, could I have you go back just a couple of steps to when you very first..yeah, I’d like to see the process from the very beginning.**

P: I guess it’s not really a VA system but I have before gone into DEERS, which you get from here. So if you look here you know you have to put in your user name. Which, on a public account...you see down here if you need an account, upgrade to premium, see I did that years ago, but I can’t remember when.

**M: What was that process when you needed to activate or upgrade?**

P: I don’t remember it being hard. I’m not tech savvy, but I don’t struggle necessarily struggle with these online systems like I know other people I know. Let’s see here, how far back can we go in account history. I had a claim recently...So that’s all this year, so that’s not good. Do you know how I can go back to see?

**M: I don’t, I apologize. Perhaps there’s something in the top, in the gray header where it says Account Activity, there may be some selectors there, but I’m not familiar with the system.**

P: Yeah it says all...Ah that only goes back 12 months. Yeah, I don’t remember having any particular trouble with it. And then later on I discovered you could file claims with it, so I used it for filing claims.

**M: Gotcha. And when you set these accounts up, I realize it was years ago, but do you remember if you had to verify who you were or anything like that?**

*[7:45]* P: Ah, Yeah, I mean like recently I had to, eBenefits I forgot my password, and it made me go in..it was just like if you’re setting up an online checking account, they ask you what house you lived in, things you get from public records. Like what mortgage you have or what car loan or whatever.

**M: Gotcha. I’m wondering if maybe we could go over to MHV and take a look at that page as well. Would you be comfortable with that?**

P: Yeah why not. So this one here you know they actually give you the choice. You can use MHV, ID.me, DS Logon. Again if I were on a public computer I would use ID.me. One of the great things about the ID.me, too, is you get the two part authentication.

**M: Yeah tell me how you feel about getting that two part authentication?**

P: Oh it’s, especially if you’re on a public computer, it’s much better. I’d prefer if it gave you the choice between email and text message though.

**M: Right, I noticed here that you used MHV to sign in here rather than the other two options, is there a reason for that?**

P: I’m not worried about how secure this system is, you know. 

**M: Gotcha.**

P: But I think you know, it’s also going to be going away soon. 

**M: What makes you say that?**

P: Like VA.gov you know, you can access the secure messaging in the va.gov and you can also, let me see here, you can refill your prescriptions in va.gov. So I think slowly but surely everything is going to migrate over there.

**M: Gotcha. I’m wondering if there have ever been occasions where you haven’t been able to login with these log in account?**

*[10:28]* P: You know, I think it’s been ebenefits where I’ve had the most problems. But the thing about ebenefits is though it’s a VA DoD system, so I think that probably has something to do with it. Also I think ebenefits has the most usage. You know like, the Veteran service officers, attorneys, you know, who represent veterans, they can access your ebenefits account through the stakeholders enterprise portal. Which when I worked as a Veteran’s service officers, so I guess I forgot one system.

**M: That’s all good. So you spent a little bit of time as a VSO, as a non VSO, have you worked with representatives or had them log in for you?**

P: No, so the VSO who helped me file my first claim...That’s what I’m looking for, they just filled out a paper form and mailed it in for me. I think they had a copy of my DD214, and some of my medical records they just mailed it in, or maybe they faxed it in, I can’t remember at that time. But through this SEP, if you have an SEP account, you can go in and see, you can log in with your PIV card or your Id.me, and you can see the veterans that you represent. You can see not all their benefits but quite a lot of it, and you can go in there, and that’s why I think that ebenefits is so busy.

**M: How often does it happen that you aren’t able to get into ebenefits?**

P: That’s a good question, you’re talking over some-odd years. You know over the years I’ll file different things with it you know. I’ll file for housing loans or stuff like that. Let me see here. It’s gotten much better in the past year, how does that sound?

**M: That’s good to hear.**

P: In the past I had significantly more trouble. 

**M: Yeah, could you give me a sense of how frequently you’re logging in, say in an average year, how often would you log into ebenefits?**

P: Oh, just, yeah not that often. Now I have an outstanding claim, but I would, if you go here, to the work in progress, you track the claims and appeals in va.gov now. You start an application here, and see if you have an intent to file, but va.gov is how you track it. So if you have an outstanding claim, you don’t need to go to ebenefits anymore. So I’m going to say, ebenefits, it’s probably about once a month let’s say.

**M: That you are logging in or that the system is not letting you log in?**

P: That I’m logging in. Like I said the past year has been pretty good. 

**M: Let’s just imagine that you have a situation where you aren’t able to log in, what do you do when that happens?**

P: come back later.

**M: Yeah?**

P: It just happens. I’ll tell you, especially on a weekend, they seem to be doing a lot of updates. So you’ll see it a lot on a monday morning, which I think is leftover from the updates they had over the weekend.

*[15:12]* **M: Gotcha. So you talked about getting like a text message or a second codes with one of your login accounts, could you remind me which one that was?**

P: All of the VA.gov, if you look here, no matter what you use, DS, MHV, or Id.me, it’s going to ask you for...let me get logged in here real quick.

**M: I see that you’re using Id.me here, is that what you would typically use for Va.gov?**

P: Uh yeah, I mean, probably. But you see here you only get a choice between text message or  phone call, you don't get a choice of having it sent to your email. Whereas like...I’m trying to think of what system I’ve used..like IRS, they give you a choice. So you go here, and if you don’t have your phone with you or whatever, that restricts you for whatever reason. But I don’t mind that two part authentication. I mean, there are probably what a million people out there trying to steal your data, so.

*[16:59]* **M: Yeah, talk to me a little about you know..you’ve mentioned security and instances where you will choose one account over another if you’re in a public space. I’m wondering what level of trust you have with these different accounts you manage?**

P: It depends. At work we got a secure account, at home I don’t worry about it cause I have my own private internet you know. But like a public internet, I would always want to use my Id.me account, because no matter what ...See here is where you track your appeals. See here you see I have an appeal outstanding, and I have an outstanding claim. I think that no matter what system you’re in, if you use Id.me to login, it asks you for that two part authentication. But let me make sure *[logs out and back in with id.me]*. So if I were on a public computer and I would go to MHV, I would use ID.me for the two part authentication, even if it is a bit laborious. 

P: Authentication failed…

**M: Talk to me about what’s happening here?**

P: I donno. It might be because I was just logged in over here. Maybe I did it too close together?

**M: Is that something that you’ve experienced before?**

P: I don’t recall having that problem before.

**M: That brings up a question I have for you. If you are trying to get into multiple sites, say you need to start an application for a claim and then you want to be able to move over to va.gov to track it, do you have to log in multiple times? What is that process like?**

P: Yeah, right now you do.. Well you have no choice right now. If you file a claim through ebenefits you can only track it through va.gov. eBenefits you can see the documents you submitted, the 526, and also any attachments you had. But to actually track any progress, it has to be done through va.gov. I’m not sure when they started that.

**M: Are there other instances, and I apologize I’m not super familiar with the ecosystem here. Are there instances where you need to go to one site to do one part of the process, but you need to go to another va site to do the other part of the process, do you need to login and log out, what sort of connection..?**

P: Well...no, like va.gov, for example you can send secure messages and order prescriptions, but I don’t think you can see your appointments in there yet, and handle your appointments. So, yeah, there’s some...if you feel more comfortable with va.gov you can do everything in there, but at some point ebenefits...another thing is if you want to see your pay history, your pay history is not available on va.gov, so you’d have to go over to ebenefits to see it. Now if you did that within va.gov, if you selected that…*[was logging in with Id.me while talking].* 

*[22:29]* P: Yeah, so here *[logged in successfully with ID.me]*, I think it was just because before I had just logged out. So if you wanted to see your pay history, your pay benefits, it would automatically move you over there. You wouldn’t have to necessarily need to log out and log back in. I’m pretty sure at one point I had to agree to that.

**M: Awesome. That has been super useful having you walk us through these log in screens. I want to be really cognizant of your time and not go over, so if it’s ok with you I just have a couple of last questions. You can think of this as a kind of a fun question. So imagine I gave you a magic wand, and you could change something about the log in processes we looked at today, or about the VA accounts, what would you change with that magic wand?**

P: It would be better if they were just in one system already, it would be better if you could do everything in one system. You know, it would be better...my understanding is they want to migrate everything over, they want to skip everything over. Now I understand in like ebenefits, you can go over and get into the DEERS account, I understand that that is a DoD system, but it would be better if you could do everything in like va.gov already, instead of going back and forth. 

**M: Yeah that makes sense..now if you could imagine in a future system, if everything associated with the va was in that one spot, you know, what would be a way that you would want to be able to log into those, you know,  if you had a choice..**

P: Well you see here va.gov has all these different things, you got healthcare and disability and education and records you know. Chances are most people are only going to be using one of them, or maybe two. So it’d be better if your homepage you could select what you see on your homepage. Does that make sense?

**M: Yeah that makes sense.**

P: Cause the vast majority of veterans aren’t going to worry about the GI Bill. Because they’re not eligible for it, or their eligibility is long past, or they’re just not you know involved in it. Records it’s the same thing, most people don’t need their medical records [inaudible], so it’s usually just going to be looking at their healthcare or looking at their disability part of it. 

*[26:00]* **M: Gotcha. We talked a lot about different accounts and processes. Is there anything that we didn’t talk about today that you think we should know?**

P: Well, Yeah, if you go to ebenefits for the newer veterans. I mean I got out in 1990 so I don’t apply. Like the army is saying now, through ebenefits, they can access their military records, anyone who is in the army and discharged after 2000. But I’ve had some veterans tell me it didn’t work for them. So I don’t know, that’s just you’d have to get a younger veteran or more recent veteran involved.

**M: Yeah do you have any ideas why that might be, that if you’re discharged after 2000, that it wasn’t working?**

P: I just assumed somewhere around 2000 they just started automatically digitizing everybody’s records.

**M: Gotcha.**

P: When I got out in 1990, and certainly the people from 1975 and before, your paper file would’ve been shipped off somewhere and put in a box or a drawer until you needed it. 

**M: Great, I just have one last question, do you have any questions for me?**

P: I can’t think of anything, not off the top of my head. Let me look through [va.gov menu items] all these real quick here.

**M: Sure, we’re happy to stay on the line with you.**

P: Like the secure messaging, not everyone in the VA is using it yet. They don’t really have that option in the veterans benefits. In the veterans benefit you gotta use the IRIS [sp?] system, you know. And that’s kind of a clunky system. If you wanna contact VA benefits this is what you gotta use. And that would be better if it were something that’s in VA.gov already. Let me see here..You know, some of this like, they mail you decision letters, you know? Or they’ll mail you letters that are updating the privacy act or something like that? I think it’d be better if the VA gave you a paperless option, just like you get from your bank. So they email and tell you it’s available instead of having to mail you all these forms. And that is not an option I’m aware of in any VA system. Except for possibly IRIS here, you can choose how you want to get answers. Yeah, IRIS you can choose if you want it by telephone, or mail. As far as I know the rest of them, even the Veterans Health Administration sends me a postcard to remind me of my appointments you know. It’s just a waste of paper and time I think. 

**M: Gotcha. Any other final thoughts?**

P: Let me see, let me look here one more time. I can’t think of anything, no. Nope, can’t think of anything off the top of my head. If you want I can see if it would let me log in to SEP. I don’t know why it would though. I haven’t been a service officer for a couple of years, so..*[logs into SEP]*

*[31:00]* **M: So it seems like you have a lot of accounts, [name], how do you keep track of all your passwords?**

P: It’s all the same password. [laughs]

**M: I won’t tell anyone.**

P: Well you know it’s all the same system, right? And then of course, on most of them, you use ID.me you got the authentication, right. That’s one of the great things about the two part authentication, right, you don’t need to worry so much about the password. Yeah, you see, I don’t have an OGC number, so I can’t do it. I’d have to register. I’ve filed to become a claims officer but I’m not one yet. But it seems to know who I am, so I'm logging in as a guest. Anyhow, that’s how I remember them all. But look at all these different systems that are out here, yeah? I know one thing to tell you, all of them had veterans employment systems, and all of them were terrible.

**M: Yeah tell me a little bit more about that?**

P: Well not anymore but in the past, they had where veterans could look for jobs, and all of them were terrible. They were useless. I think eventually they just gave up on all of them. There were always companies trying to convince you to become a security guard.

**M: Awesome, this has been very very useful [name], do you have any other thoughts before we wrap up today?**

P: No, no. Where are you all located?

**M: We are from all over, we have people on all coasts…**
