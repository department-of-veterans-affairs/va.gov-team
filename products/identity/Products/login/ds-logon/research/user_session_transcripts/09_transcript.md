*[moderator reads opening script]*

*[0:12]* **M: What VA websites or applications do you access online?**

P: Well we try to use MyHealtheVet. We have a lot of difficulty with it. And then we uh we do use, I’m not sure what it is but we’re able to print the letter for award and family member information. And then I use to look for research and things that I can ask the VA specifically to provide us treatment options for my husband because they tend to put that information up for the nation before our local VA has the information.

**M:  Gotcha. So the site that you use to print letters, is that eBenefits by chance?**

P: Yeah.

**M: Yeah okay. And how do you log into each of those websites?**

P: Um, I’m not the one that logs into eBenefits; I stand there and watch him while he does that. So I’m not sure exactly where he’s going. My HealtheVet we just go to the My HealtheVet page. But for a lot of us, caregiver-wise it’s been locking us out from having-- we’re supposed to have our own access and we don’t. Um so it’s always a bit dicey. And he can get in some days, and some days not. So that’s the DS part of it. Um and we’re not, and our caregiver coordinator has said she’d help us with this, but we’re not able to get it open. We’re not able to communicate with anyone other than his primary care doctor and see only his most typical-- so we can see his blood test results, we can see sometimes like if they send him for an MRI of his back or an urgent x-ray we can see those, but we can’t see any of the other tests for him. Or talk to any of the other providers. No secure email.

**M: Gotcha. And when you say caregiver-wise you’re supposed to have your own access but you don’t, what do you mean by that?**

P: It isn’t supposed to just be under his name; he’s supposed to be able to log in and look but I’m supposed to be able to log in under my own logon name and password to be able to see too.

**M: Gotcha. And is that for My HealtheVet or eBenefits?**

P: That’s for My HealtheVet.

**M: Mkay. Yeah, so you mentioned then for DS Logon there are some days that he can get in and some days that he can’t. What happens on those days that he can’t?**

P: It basically makes him reset everything, or he has to wait and then go through the verification process again.

**M: Gotcha. What is that verification process?**

*[3:02]* P: Well you’re supposed to be able to verify online but right now it says “be advised the ability to online remote-proof your identity is unavailable for an extended period of time, alternatives to online remote proofing are um that you can visit the nearest VA regional office with the documents or call in to verify your identity with the VA.”

**M: Gotcha. So, I just want to understand the process a little better. When you say “makes him reset everything,” does that mean he has to make a new account?**

P: Um, it’ll make him change the login and the password but he’ll have to get on the phone and call somebody. Most of the time he doesn’t feel up for doing that, so it just dangles there until the next time I catch wind that we need to be using it for something, maybe new blood tests are in there, and then all the drama of it-- we have to go back through the process.

**M: Gotcha. So it sounds like he can call and reset the login but if that doesn’t work then he has to do the identity verification? Or is that something that he does when he calls to reset the login?**

*[4:15]* P: I think he’s been able to do it by calling.

**M: Mkay.**

P: But there have been issues where he could see other people’s information and was worried that people could see-- I mean there are some issues with this. [audio breaks up]

**M: Now when you say able to see other people’s information, what do you mean by that?**

P: I mean another veteran’s information came up when he entered his logon. 

**M: Oh okay. Yeah I can see how that would be concerning.**

P: Yeah. He’s like “I don’t know if I really want my stuff in here.” And I’m like “yeah but we have to use it. They expect us to use it.”

**M: Yeah, I’m wondering, you know, are there different levels of trust? It sounds like your husband is not super excited to have his stuff in the eBenefits system. Are there levels of trust that you folks have with these different websites? Different login accounts?**

P: Um yeah, this one is not one that we are super trusting of. I think there’s just been a lot of different things and I think he gets frustrated with using it. Um it was very problematic in the beginning because when we were supposed to be setting it up with both of us in it [audio breaks up] to see his stuff, was a time when he had a great deal of paranoia and was in and out of the hospital and he would forget his logins and things like that and I don’t doubt that there’s a paper out there somewhere that says my wife shouldn’t be able to see this. That is not our case now, we’ve been doing this for a very long time. He started inpatient with the VA in 2004 so we’ve got a lot of water under the bridge. Thankfully he’s not been hospitalized, but we still can’t see his stuff, or this month, one of his doctors wanted me to send her something through there, couldn’t do it, had to get the caregiver coordinator involved, she was like “you should be able to do this! C’mon, you’ve been in this program a long time! You should know by now!” I’m like we can’t. It’s not just-- I don’t have an account, but he can’t make it work and we don’t have this access.

*[6:42]* **M: Right.**

P: So, “but you’re supposed to!” I said yes, I understand we’re supposed to. The fact is we don’t. So she was going to sit down and go over it and look at the way it was set up, but I didn’t hear back from her, so. 

**M: Yeah, have you worked--**

P: [audio breaks up]

**M: Sorry to interrupt you there. You mentioned the caregiver coordinator, have you worked with caregiver coordinators to set up these accounts for yourself or your husband? What has that relationship with the caregiver coordinator been like?**

P: She said she could help us but I have not seen her been able to do it.

**M: Mmm. I want to circle back to something you mentioned, I believe this is for My HealtheVet, but you mentioned you’re not able to communicate with anyone except his PCP. Do you know why that is? Can you tell me a little more about that?**

P: It says all of his providers are not set up on the system. They say they are, but I don’t know if they’re not listed to him in some internal matching space, or if they’re not as fully set up as they think they are. I mean in other words I think they get contact with some people but they’ve never tried to send us a message and have it go either. In other words when they’ve tried to send us a message, they will get the response “the veteran’s not available.” 

*[8:39]* **M: Gotcha. So how, you know, just to give me a rough estimate, how often are you logging into eBenefits and My HealtheVet?**

P: A couple times a month.

**M: Okay, and is that the same for both?**

P: Yeah, we have needed that information, you know, we double-check appointments in there. I guess he can see those. I don’t know why he can’t see his providers if the appointments show. But anyway he can get his appointments off of there so we’re always double-checking those because they have a tendency to make appointments for us and then not send letters or tell us, so we’re pretty paranoid about that. And uh I would say he needs a letter or an updated piece of something or other about every month at least. Probably once a month for eBenefits and a couple times a month for My HealtheVet. 

**M: Yeah, and um for eBenefits you mentioned some days it works some days it doesn’t. How, if you’re logging in once a month, how frequently is it that it isn’t working, or that you’re able to get in?**

P: The last time that one was down was probably in July I think. For a day or two. That one’s not been as bad as My HealtheVet.

**M: Right. And you can answer this for yourself or for you husband: has there been an instance when you’ve needed to set up another type of account in order to access these websites or similar websites?**

P: Um like you mean to reset the account and set up a new email account in order to be able to connect with them?

**M: Sure, or you know other VA applications, other VA websites. Whatever--**

P: I think he has, not me. I already have two email accounts, that’s plenty. I’m not up for a third.

*[10:58]* **M: Gotcha. So it sounds like your husband will create different email accounts in order to set up accounts to connect for VA websites, is that correct?**

P: Yes. Making it very difficult to keep up with him. And he forgets what he does, rather like a squirrel in his squirrel hole, “Oh no I opened a new one, I don’t know what I did.” Thank you very much. I don’t know if we’re going to figure that out.

**M: Gotcha.**

P: If I haven’t mentioned he has a brain injury as well, a lot of memory issues, so it’s very difficult for him to keep track of where he left off.

**M: Yeah, so if you had to give me kind of like a 10,000-foot summary of your experience with these different login options, what has that experience been like?**

P: It’s frustrating. It’s a good platform and I think it can work and it should work, I see it work for others. Very large hospital systems, I mean maybe they’re not as large as the VA but they’re pretty huge, and it’s very helpful. I’m not sure why this is frustrating than that would be. But it is. We feel like whenever we get anything out of there, if we see it we have to print it because it might not be there when we get back. That’s been the case quite a bit too. I don’t know if it archives them or where it goes. So it doesn’t eliminate our need for paper, unfortunately. I wish that it could.

**M: I’m curious how you tend to access these websites. Are you using your mobile phone? Do you do this on desktop?**

P: Laptops, mainly

**M: Laptops? Okay.**

P: We can sort of do it on his phone, but most of the time it doesn’t work well on the phone and then he’s like, “Forget it I’ll just do it at home.”

**M: Mmmm.**

P: And I know that he had at one point upgraded to the premium account too, and I don’t know how he did that. So. I sent him a text to see if he’s a little bit awake. I hear him coughing so maybe he’ll come and log me in before we’re done.

**M: Oh yeah no worries, this has been useful on its own even without the screensharing. So it’s all good. Yeah when you say it doesn’t work super well on his phone, what about it is difficult?**

*[13:48]* P: Um he clicks on links and they don’t open effectively, um or different functions don’t seem to respond on his phone. So he might be able to enlarge it, click on it, and he’s waiting for it to go and then it just kind of comes back, “try again later” sort of … he gets frustrated with, I’ve heard him say four or five times “forget it, I’ll just do it when I’m home.” 

**M: Alright, so we’ve managed to move through a lot of these questions actually really rapidly, so I just have a few more for you if you’re okay hanging on the line.**

P: Sure.

**M: Great. So one of my last questions for you, you know, in a future perfect world, if I gave you a magic wand and you could change something about this process of getting VA accounts or logging in, what would you change?**

*[14:56]* P: I’d like it to be able to work a little bit more effectively. I appreciate the security aspect of it. I’m a little bit worried about why there are the anomalies that there are, and certainly at one point we also had a letter that kind of said his data had been breached. That was not long after we had the other guy’s information in his file, so I wonder if they got swapped, I don’t know. The numbers didn’t seem close. I think he has a lot of anxiety about that. And you know it’s kind of a, it’s kind of a catch-22 because you know there’s a big flap going on right now about VA records in general with the community program and this sort of blanket opt-out versus opt-in thing that’s been happening these last ten days or so, but then at the same time it can be so extraordinarily difficult to log into your own information and you know it’s like other people can get access to it faster than we can with nefarious means and we struggle to use it as it’s supposed to be used. And we do a lot of stuff. His background is in computers, so is mine, we’re all online for everything. Almost all our bills and so forth are paperless, so we’re not you know in our 70s and kind of hunting, pecking, and not computer savvy. We’re pretty good. So when we struggle with that, we really kind of feel like, jeez, this seems like it’s not keeping up with the times. It feels like it’s, you know from an interface and it doesn’t feel like, it doesn’t feel like it’s even close to any of the other things we’re doing for our kids’ medical records or to be able to look up e-records for any of our other activities or medical care in other places. So there’s that piece. So I’d love to see that piece improved. The second piece would be that I’d really like to be able to talk to somebody, at least during certain hours, to be able to chat, “hey look I’m trying to log in today, it isn’t working,” or “I’m looking for this VA provider, they said they’re trying to reach me and I can’t reach them.” Because if you call for help, you’re online or you’re on the phone on hold waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting. And there’s lots of things that make us wait these days. I was on one of these calls where I was trying to problem-solve a charge on our credit card. So by the time you add up all these things over the course of a week, it’s really frustrating and the last place that I’ve got the time or the energy to sit and sit on hold for an hour is with VA stuff. And that’s usually what will happen if there’s a problem here. Which is why he opts out of handling it. Like “I’ve been on hold for ten minutes, I can’t handle this anymore.” Well it becomes my job if we’re going to fix it. Otherwise I’ve got to find a different way to handle it. And frankly, I’ll look for a different way to handle it because I don’t have the ability to sit mostly on hold either. I’m taking care of him, I’m only tier 2 as a caregiver, he’s got tier 3 needs but I’m tier 2 so that means I’ve got to hustle. I’ve got five kids, I I have a little business that I run that needs my attention, so I’m hustling all the time. And I just feel like it’s really hard to get this to do what I want it to do.

*[18:38]* **M: Yeah, that definitely sounds frustrating, if there’s not a whole lot of time in the day. It sounds like you’re a very busy person.**

P: And the point of this was to make it easier because those doctors are busy too. I mean I don’t know if you’ve ever tried to call in and reach a VA doctor, but it’s not easy to get them that way either. And there’s no way to have a record of what you’ve done or not done. So like for example this issue that just came up, where the caregiver coordinator got involved. He sees a doctor in July who says to him “okay yes, we’ve tried all these different things for pain” -- he’s in terrible pain. So “we’re going to go ahead and order this machine you’ve asked for, it’s an arcwave therapy machine.” If you’ve heard of a tens unit that gives you a little electro stimulation to distract you from the pain, this a big one and it does a big shock to distract you from the pain. We know it works, doctors ordered it. Doctor can’t follow up with us to say “hey we’ve ordered it but we want to confirm the model number of the machine.” She’s got to try to call, but she’s busy so it takes three weeks to call. When she finally reaches us, I’m like “yes, I will get that for you, I’m driving, I don’t have it, let me get that to you. How can I get it to you? Do you want me to call your nurse?” She goes “put it in My HealtheVet; then we’ll have the picture, we’ll have the link, I can go in there and look.” We can’t get into My HealtheVet to give it to her. We call back and try to find a nurse, try to find, she’s in clinic one day a week, we can only reach her one day a week, but she’s seeing patients the whole time. So another three weeks goes by, and now nobody’s worked on it, and then she finally calls back, and she’s like “okay, My HealtheVet doesn’t work, give it to the caregiver coordinator because I want to have a link, I want a hot link and she can send it to me.” So I send the link, caregiver coordinator’s out of town for the week. She comes back and goes, “why are you sending this to me instead of My HealtheVet!” I’m like “because My HealtheVet doesn’t work!” She says “okay, I’ll get it to her.” Another week goes by. Now I get a call from a social worker in a whole different department, “he’s in pain? I’m the pain management social worker.” No no no no, we’ve been through this, there’s nothing pain management can do. Can you just get this approved for him please and get it here? We are at 94 days today since we started this. So if we had had the ability to connect properly with her and put this information in there in a place she could get it in real time and work on it in real time and send it along in real time, it probably would have been done in three weeks. But all of these other people got involved, all of these other things, his pain is through the roof, and he’s like just “get it, just get it, please just get it!” And I’m struggling to reach people in their offices to connect the dots and get it to the right place so the order can be placed and it can be sent. This doesn’t happen in the rest of the world. This is a VA-unique thing, but that’s the story of my 15 years with the VA. That’s where this needs to work; it really really needs to work, and not be this difficult and not have … you know I’ve got to sit on hold and try to find and problem-solve and figure out and have him sitting here getting upset with it. So, I don’t know if that’s what you were asking, but that’s what my hope would be.

**M: Yeah. I am so sorry to hear that that is … you hear these stories about the delays and the time it takes to get care and I’m so sorry that you folks are having to go through that. And those sorts of stories are you know really important for you know driving the sorts of change that we’re hoping for. So while that may not seem exactly like what we’re trying to get at with these research sessions and on these calls, that is actually really impactful information and I really appreciate you for sharing that.**

P: Sure, no problem.

**M: Yeah, so that was, that’s it for the questions I had for you. Um do you have any final thoughts or anything that we didn’t talk about today that you think  I should know? Any questions for me?**

P: No, I think that’s what I know about it, and I’m sitting here frustrated all over again.

**M: I’m so sorry.**

P: And that’s not your fault, and I really intended to be logged in so we could move on a little bit. But I think, you know, especially on My HealtheVet when you go to the frequently asked questions and there’s this very long list of all the error codes, I think that speaks volumes to what the end user interface experience might be.

**M: Right.**

*[23:37]* P: I think there’s probably close to 40 there if you’ve ever looked.

**M: Alright, well this has definitely been really really helpful for us, and again we appreciate you taking the time out of your day to share your thoughts with us.**

P: No problem, glad you’re doing it.

**M: yeah, yeah, and if you know any veterans or caregivers or other service members who you think might be interested in doing something like what we did today, um when we follow up we’ll include some information that you can share out with others if that’s something you’re interested in doing.**

P: Sure absolutely.

**M: Great. Well thank you so much again for your time, I hope you enjoy the rest of the day, and please give your husband our appreciation and thank him for his service on our behalf.**

P: Will do, thank you very much.

**M: Have a great day.**

P: You too, bubye.
