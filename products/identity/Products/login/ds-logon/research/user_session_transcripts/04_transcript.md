# DS Logon Research

Participant = P

*[moderator reads opening script]*

*[00:00]* **M: Alright, we are recording. Just to confirm again, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**

P: Yes, I am.

**M: Perfect. So we can dive in with a couple warm questions. Um, first off, what VA website or applications do you access online?**

P: Uh, I uh, primarily Myhealthevet. Uh, eBenefits sometimes, to generate letters. Va.gov for various kinds of things. Um, there may be more but that’s, I think myHealtheVet is what I think of. You know, to renew my prescriptions and direct messaging with my care providers.

**M: Gotcha. And how do you–**

P: There may be others. It’s been changing here, lately, with VA. You know, the DS Logon and all of that, it’s been awfully confusing quite frankly.

**M: Yeah, tell me a little bit more about what’s confusing there.**

P: Uh, sure. So I was trying to generate, I’m going through the process now of applying for a mortage, I needed to uh, access, uh you know, some letters verifying you know, my VA service-connected disability compensation. And so trying to access those letters was awful. Um, it crashes continually. Trying to log on is extremely frustrating using that DS Logon, which I guess is for DoD and VA things. Oh gosh, okay. I thought I turned that off. I’m sorry. Uh, it’s extremely frustrating in particular the requirement I thought everyone stopped doing 15 years ago of having to change your password every however often. So every time I login, I have to change and the requirements for having a password are ridiculous. You know, these long things. So I’ve just - I use a Mac and I just started using the, you know, the Mac generating a password for me. But then you can’t even use that. So I don’t know if anybody is familiar with the Mac, you’re typically able to autofill passwords and logins. It doesn’t work on DS Login. So I have to save a special spreadsheet with my passwords um, and login to that. It’s the most awful process trying to login. Sometimes the login doesn’t work. Um, I’ve been, you know, had to regenerate a password repeatedly. And again, it seems like every, I don’t what it was, every 3 months or whatever it is, that your password expires and I don’t know if it’s still doing it. It was doing that for a long time. You have to create a new one. And then finally, trying to get in there and uh, get those letters, this was only...I don’t know, 2 weeks ago, maybe, trying to get those letters. And the system was down at one point, it was during the night. Um, trying to generate them...nothing was working. Um, and I had to wait till the next day or whatever it was. Um, so, I don’t know what it is but every time I use it...[inaudible] provider like Apple or Amazon, their systems always work properly. Whenever it’s any government website, it’s always these antiquated login systems. Things don’t work right, whether it be, you know, VA or social security or accessing my thrift savings account the other day, and they’re all broken. And frankly, it’s extremely frustrating. And I’ll save some comments for myHealtheVet later. But that’s just for the DS Logon in particular. It’s awful and it needs to be...I mean, bring some people in and have, you know, streamline it so it’s smooth and easy to use. And it’s awful. One more piece I should add and that’s that apparently there are multiple applications that uh, when you use DS Login that are able to be accessed. And the integration of them is awful. Things just don’t work properly.

*[04:16]* **M: Gotcha. And when you say the integration, could you tell me a little bit more about what you mean there?**

P: Sure. So I shouldn’t have to login multiple times. Um, you know, once I’m logged in I should be logged in, period. And I shouldn’t have to login repeatedly. And uh, it’s just a jumble of information. I mean, if we were looking at it on the screen right now, I could tell you more clearly what we were talking about. But um, it’s just not user friendly at all.

**M: Yeah, and it sounds like there’s definitely a lot of extra work that goes into using the systems. You had mentioned that if we were looking at it, we could walk through that. Would you be comfortable screen sharing so we could do that?**

*[05:00]* P: Yes.

**M: Perfect.**

P: Well, yes and no.

**M: Okay.**

P: If we have to, if I’m not able to login automatically then no, I’m not going to be able to. Because I’m not going to show my, uh, since we’re recording the screen, I’m not going to show my spreadsheet with my saved passwords.

**M: Oh, of course no.**

P: We can try but probably, I’m not going to be able to because I don’t have the password memorized. 

**M: Yeah, not a problem.**

P: We can try.

**M: Perfect, we don’t even need to go through the actual login of you know, entering your credentials and seeing what happens after we login. But just looking at this screen and you can walk us through you know, what happens here, what happens here. That’d be perfect.**

P: Sure. And I’ll put it in really simple terms: using DS Logon um, is one of the worst online experiences I have. Period.

**M: Yeah, I can imagine that’d be really frustrating. Especially if you say, need letters for a mortgage or something like that. I can imagine that be, uh…**

P: Right. And some of it is more clear than others and some of it is just awful. And are we going to be talking about myHEaltheVet today or are we not going to be talking about that?

**M: Um, we are happy to talk about um, any of those logon accounts that you have, actually.**

P: Okay. Great. So please save a placeholder there because I have some, uh, thoughts I would love to share on myHealtheVet as well.

**M: Sure. So if you are comfortable screen sharing, we can pull up either of those. eBenefits or myHealtheVet, whichever you would like to talk about first.**

P: And that’s for me to do, not for you?

**M: If you prefer. I can bring it up on my screen but if you are comfortable doing that, we can also do it on your screen.**

P: Okay, let’s try that.

*[moderator helps participant set up screenshare]*

P: Okay. so what am I logging into? Am I logging into DS Login or what am I doing?

**M: Either eBenefits or myHealtheVet, whichever one you would like to talk about first.**

P: eBenefits, alright, let’s try eBenefits. Okay. So this is what I’m talking about first off. This whole screen is a massive jumble of stuff. And it’s nice that, you know, there’s this apply and manage benefits and manage health but it’s all words. These little symbols are, you know, I look at manage health and that plus sign. I don’t know what that is. I mean, is that, is that the Red Cross? It’s a jumble. Manage benefits with a little symbol there. To me, that looks like settings. And apply, I guess if I’m looking really close...I have my glasses on now so I can look at it closer than I have before. I see a tiny little arrow there, clicking on something, but it’s, to me, I just see a computer screen and it’s okay, grea. But that's not what calls my attention when I look at this is there are words all over this whole thing. And the very top is the most important message of all and it’s kind of in this orange, orange brown color. And it’s for outage events. There shouldn’t be an outage event. Why in the world is there an outage event? And...I’ve experienced a number of those. And there shouldn’t be any, ever. And I...you know, If Amazon never has an outage event when I use Amazon to order things, why does eBenefit have outages? I mean, I thought that all went away in the 1980’s.

**M: Yeah, how frequently does it seem that DS Logon is having an outage event in your experience?**

P: Um, several, uh well. So I’ve tried to log on a few times in the last month or so and it’s been most of those experiences, most of those times. That I’m not able to access part of what I’m trying to access.

**M: Mhm.**

P: So for example, one of them. I click on VA Letters um, you know, and all these little symbols afterwards, we don’t need them. Let’s just make it really simple and clear. And um, I was on eBay recently. eBay is also an old antiquated jumble that hasn’t been updated recently. You use Netflix. Netflix is super easy to use. And everything is nice and clear, it’s just, it’s intuitive, it’s user friendly. This is a bunch of words and it’s not.

**M: Mhm.**

*[10:26]* P: You know, for example, can you see what I’m hovering with my mouse when I’m doing that?

**M: I can, yeah.**

P: So why do we need all this junk? This P symbol and this little thing? Why can’t it just say TRICARE? You know all of this, MyHealtheVet. I mean if we’re using myHealtheVet, we probably we know what that is. Just MyHealtheVet. And frankly, MyHealtheVet is the longest word as well. You know, why...why couldn’t it just be eVA or something really simple. Um, you know, all of this. Hearing aid batteries and prosthetic socks. Is that really more important than MyHealtheVet and TRICARE? I mean, how many people are ordering prosthetic socks every time they log on here? And if they are, I mean, that’s great, they need to be able to find that. But I guarantee there’s a whole lot more people trying to access MyHealtheVet than looking for prosthetic socks.

**M: Yeah, that all makes sense. So—**

P: You know, appointments...why don’t we have a VA section so we don’t have to say VA one, two, three times. IT doesn’t need to be said just appointments, refills, letters...what have you. And making it super simple and super clear and easy to use. And don’t have government people who are you know, bureaucratically minded, doing all this. Have people who design things like Netflix’s website designing this stuff so it’s super clear and easy to use. And now that’s just the top part. I haven’t even noticed, you scroll down and there’s all this stuff. We’re moving...I don’t need to know that you’re moving. Just make it...You know, Netflix doesn’t tell me when they’re moving. I don’t need to know anybody else is moving. Featured resources and then there’s this drop down menu...I’m not clicking on this drop down menu, looking for all this stuff. And then there’s learn about all these other things and there’s all this other stuff down here. This webpage is a mess. And then I guess there’s more up in here as well. This doesn’t need to...I mean. I just need to be able to figure out what I’m logging onto and that’s it. Login should be really big. Register should be smaller. 

**M: Yeah, that all makes sense. I’m wondering, what does it look like if you click on the login button?**

P: All right. Uh, nothing. Well, so slow. That’s another point. So super, super, super slow. Okay. All of this stuff. Is this really necessary? I mean, I’ve got all this stuff to get through every single time. It’s, you know, come on, let’s just login. When I login to Netflix it doesn’t take all this. And granted, it’s a government website and I guess there are protections but put all of this at the bottom. Have a great big login button up here. I’m frustrated, I guess you can tell.

**M: Mhm.**

*[13:35]* P: But it’s when I needed information that I needed, I couldn’t get it. And that’s not, you know...that’s..that’s just unacceptable. Scrolling through all this, this tiny little box down here. I have to wear my glasses to be able to see this. And it’s by selecting the check box and all of this. Every single time I login. Is that really necessary? Or can’t we just do it the very first time  that I sign up for DS Logon? Okay, now clicking and trying to login. I click on it. Nothing happens. I don’t even see where I’m supposed to be logging in. I’m not able...I don’t know. I’m clicking and you can see what’s happening. I don’t know if this is allowing me...it doesn’t allow me to enter anything. So not unusual. So then I go back up and I refresh. Oh I guess...this is what happened the last time. I didn’t remember to check this little box. There’s nothing that says hey, you have to check this little box. So, okay, that’s the problem. I’ve got to check this little box. Okay, now I’m able to do something. Well if I didn’t figure that out...how many Veterans never get past that and they can’t even figure out what’s happening, they just give up in frustration? So now I’m able to login. I have no idea what my logon is. So it’s really great that my Mac saves all of that for me, so I can remember. Because you know, we have to login to everything these days. And that’s not acceptable to me. If I trust my Mac enough to save my logon, well I think this website should as well. So we’re not going to be able to login today because I’m, you know, I don’t have my password and my password is auto-generated because of the, excuse me, the crazy rules of it. Like I was mentioning before. So, um, and having to change it all of the time, which is, I mean, in a word: stupid.

*[15:41]* **M: Yeah. It seems like the process of logging in itself is rather burdensome given what you’ve told us. I’m wondering, do you remember what it was like to set up the account initially? What that process was like?**

P: No, it was a long time ago but I believe I had to do it more than once which has not been very fun. Um, as well. And then all of this, it’s just, all of this stuff. What is a Premium account? I don’t care. What is a Premium account? Either I can login or I can’t. You know and I don’t need to know about that up front. If I can’t access something then I should have a message that pops up and says “you can’t access this because and here’s what you need to do in order to be able to access that.” But I don’t need to be told up front I’m, you know, here’s stuff about a premium account. Who cares? That’s not relevant to my experience.

**M: Yeah, so I know you’re not going to be able to login today, but I’m wondering when you are able to successfully login —**

P: Okay, so let’s pause for a moment. So I see my little key there, I’ve never seen this before so I’m going to try. And it looks like I might be able to. Looks, okay, so looks like I’m now able to. I don’t know why I couldn’t before. I mean, we both saw that I couldn’t before and now somehow I can after three minutes, so —

**M: Maybe that’s the perfect number. [laughs]**

P: [laughs] so I’m going to try to and login now. Meanwhile, I would be searching and I save my passwords in a password-protected file. So I have to go find that login, find the password in there, cut and paste, come back and do that. So now here we are, we’re in there. This is great that my VA Letters is up top now. When I clicked on this a couple weeks ago, I couldn’t, I couldn’t access my letters. It just wasn’t working and it gave me a message telling me why. Meanwhile I’ve got all this stuff up here and the top including outage events. That should’ve all gone away when I logged in I should only be notified if there IS an outage. Like every other website out there tells us.

**M: Mhm.**

P: Alright, so letter generator, I’m going to click on that just for fun. Okay. So many words on this page. This is all not necessary. And all of this stuff, I hover above the Commissary button and maybe have something pop up that tells me that if I’m not really sure what commissary means.But, you know, letter and...step one? Let’s just have us walk me through that. So I don’t need all this stuff on the side. Because all this grey box takes my attention. I’m looking over here already. I just happened to notice looking at the top step 2 and oh, where’s step 1? So going back and looking at step 1. So I’m actually really, I was excited when I received your notification that I could sign up for this study because this is, you know, there are some user experiences in VA that are getting better. This is not one of them. So I’m really pleased that you’re doing this and I hope that the work that you’re doing will actually lead to positive change.

**M: Yeah, it definitely seems like there’s lots of room for growth and improving this process so that —**

P: Yes.

**M: – you know, so it’s easier for you folks.**

P: Yes, and if there’s somebody on the line right now who’s wedded to all this and has been involved in creating it — thank you for your work in doing so. And uh, um, times have changed. And we um, hopefully will be working you know, you’ll be working together with what I’m suggesting to try and fix to uh, improve things. You know, things that are a lot more user friendly for people.

**M: Yeah, definitely.**

*[19:57]* P: Ok so, update your contact information, what have you. Why not just pop up a screen as, you know, here’s your contact information. Is this still good? And when I go to VA to login for my, check in for my appointments, it does it every time. And maybe I don’t need to do that every single time because there’s so many screens of doing that at the, you know, the kiosk at the VA. But this is pretty straightforward. And it’s the pop up with the screen right now that says “here’s the address we have on file. Is this correct?” Yes in a big green button. No in a little red button. Click yes? Okay, next screen. What letter do you want to generate? And...and then, you know, have an option and click on one of them.

**M: Yeah, this has been super useful to see from the eBenefits side. I’m wondering if we could have you walk us through the myHealtheVet side as well?**

P: Sure. So can I go back and do that? Or how does that work?

**M: Uh, how would you normally do that?**

P: So I’m going to click the back button to try and find that out. What I would probably do here is maybe it’s integrated now, I would get out of here. And I would just login to myHealtheVet. I would type myHealtheVet in my...in my...in my address bar up here. Just out of curiosity, I’m going to scroll through here. So maybe this takes me down here, maybe this now takes me to MyHealtheVet. MyHealtheVet is huge, you know. I mean that’s...healthcare and benefits are the two big things that I would think I would be looking for and most Veterans would be looking for. They should be great big buttons. Health and benefits. And...you know, letters, the fact that letters is up top is great. And obviously, you know, for benefits, do I want to know...you know, I haven’t had an active claim in a while but I work with other Veterans who are. Um, I hear lots of complaints about not being able to access things, that the information is not clear. Um, as well. So that’s, that’s really problematic. The fact that benefits is way down here and is tiny, I mean, look at all of the other words on this screen? How many, 150-200 words on this screen and then there’s that word, benefits. Same size as all, as everything else. Maybe these are slightly smaller down here. But, even if I know what I’m looking for, I can’t find it. And who care about this last log in? Why is that as big as...I don’t care about my last login. Why is that, you know, there’s more words there than the word benefits down here, to find it. And for healthcare, alright so I’m going to click on this to see if I can get to MyHealtheVet. Oh something happening...so I already know something is happening so I go up here to my status bar to see. Again, you know, all of this stuff on this page. Make it simple like Netflix. My VA Appointments, just one word: appointments. You know, all this stuff, you know, we don’t need VA...I’m on VA, I don’t need to know that this is VA every time. So here, here’s, oh gosh. My VA medical provider messaging, all this stuff. Just messaging is simple enough or eMessaging, I don’t care. TRICARE, again just one word here. Okay, so, uh, where are we going? To messaging or appointments?

**M: I’m wondering if you could take us, you know,  to where you would login for MyHealtheVet.**

P: Oh well, that’s a good question. I have no idea from here. Uh, I’m going to click on appointments to see if it takes me there. So at least now, I like this. It’s telling me that it’s actually trying to get us there. Rather than me having to go up here in my status bar. Okay. So this is interesting. I’ve never seen this before in my life. That it’s an actual calendar showing the uh, you know, showing the appointments and what’s upcoming. I love it. That’s great. I’ve never seen that before when I’m in MyHealtheVet it’s this long list and I have complaints about that as well. So this is great. So if I’m clicking here, I like that if I want more information, I click on it there. Thats um you know that’s, that’s very helpful. So I can tell, you know, what it is. However, it doesn’t tell me the information I need here. So it tells me it’s at the Bradenton VA Clinic, it’s got the clinic phone number. It says scheduled/kept...I don’t know why kept is in there. That doesn’t make any sense to me, cause it’s in the future. And for type, which is what I want to know, is this a lab appointment? Is this a fasting lab appointment which is critical to know in advance? Is it a mental health appointment which tells me I need to bring some papers with me? Uh, uh, is it my new primary care appointment which is upcoming here? One of these appointments is a primary care appointment. As you can see, I have 7 appointments coming up. Seven in october, six are upcoming, to put it simply. I don’t know which is which. And apparently if I hover over this, I can’t tell. So I’m going to click on this one to see what happens. So I click on it and it does nothing. Why am I able to click? Hovering brings me that, click should take me somewhere rather than down here. I just noticed this down here, “chat with the VA.” I can only imagine what that’s like and I’m sure there are hours for that as well but I’m not even going to try that. Okay, so that’s my frustration with that. I’m, I guess I’m sounding like a frustrated person today.

*[25:53]* **M: It seems like there’s lots of little things that you know together will cause lots of frustration. So, I can—**

P: I mean, for example — yes. I know I have a fasting lab coming up. I know it’s one of these. So if I was going through all of this to find out when my fasting lab is, it would be minutes, not seconds, in order to find that out.

**M: Mhm.**

P: And um, *[discusses previous role at government agency]*. Including um, we did under my watch, and direction did a complete overhaul of the agency’s website and communications materials to make them user-friendly. And my directive to the staff there was that no Vetran should have to click more than twice to get to where they need to. From first logging onto the website. So whether that’s possible in this situation or not, um...you log on to the website and then you have to login — which is okay. But once you’ve, once you’re, you know. So that should be one, that should be the very first experience — you click and you’re logged in. And then count the two from there. So now you’re on a main landing page. At most click on one thing like health or benefits and then one more time, click on what you need, and now you’re where you actually need to be. So to get to this calendar should be after login. In my view, it should only be two clicks to get there. And we’re not there. And frankly the fact that’s there’s a calendar, I would love to see the word calendar. Why not. And all this stuff up here again as well, is all that stuff really necessary and up front is the most important things? I mean again, a 100, 150 words there. Get rid of all that.

**M: Mhm.**

P: Nice big button, “calendar.” Which is up here, but again, it’s words. So, you know, my eye’s looking quickly for what I need. I love the calendar but it doesn’t give me the information I need.

**M: Yeah, in the interest of time, I don’t want to keep you too long. I’m wondering if we could go to the myHealtheVet website. It seems like it may not connect directly from here.**

P: Sure. [inaudible]

**M: No, please.**

P: And to add that as a point, why is there more than one login to do VA stuff? It should just be one. So I love this, this big login button but make it bigger than the register button. Register is a longer word so my eye goes to register first. All of these things...I don’t need all of these things when login is smaller. So if I want to go to Appointments, let’s go to Appointments. Okay, all of this stuff...how...where am I going to find my appointments? And this is my experience the other day. This is the re-work that’s recent. I scroll through all this and way down here, you know, it’s not even on the same screen. So one screen down, two screens down...it’s in the third screen, here’s my login button. And is something happening? I can’t tell, but I had to go up here and see the status bar. Now I’ve got to login again. I was just logged in to, you know, as you saw. So I guess there’s my login.

**M: Yeah, I notice that you’re using MyHealtheVet login here.**

P: Yes.

**M: Is there a reason that you’re choosing that one over other options on the page?**

*[29:42]* P: Yeah, because I have no idea how to get there and ID.me doesn’t work for me.

**M: Mhm.**

P: So it took me uh, to uh...I just was never able to get logged in even though I’ve got a login there. And I finally gave up on trying to use it. It looked like it was supposed to be simple, but it wasn’t. DS Logon is that frustrating password experience, so, yeah I would much rather login like this directly to MyHealtheVet, you know, I would love just, why not...eVA login one button and everything is right there. And eDoD if you’re whatever. Okay. So I can login with my password. Who knows why? Maybe there’s another one.

**M: Do you find that that happens currently for MyHealtheVet?**

P: Uh, yes. Okay so now I’m able to login. Maybe. I guess that’s what’s happening with this white screen. Okay, now here I am logged in again. It doesn’t take me...I’m remembering back a moment ago that there was four choices. So I clicked on the one choice for appointments. Now I’m here. This is not the 2-click situation that I’m describing. Okay. I appreciate this notification telling me what’s happening. Okay. Happening. So, I don’t know why it says New York or America. I mean, if I’m going to the VA, unless I’m in Guam or the Phillipines, I’m in America. New York, I’m not in New York. That’s just confusing. Um. So, again, let’s just for example, I’m looking for my labs. Here’s my labs that I’m looking for. I wanna know whether this is, am I fasting or am I not fasting? This is actually new since the last time I logged in a week or two ago. Before it listed all of my appointments including the past ones. To prepare for my appointment. Okay, still doesn’t tell me — is this fasting or not fasting? I have no idea.

**M: Before we get too deep into looking at um, these pages, I want to make sure we stay on track for time and don’t keep you too long. So we have just a couple minutes left.**

P: You direct me please. I’ll stop.

**M: No, this has been really great. It’s been very useful to see you logging into multiple accounts. I noticed that when you tried both you did have that error that, you know, perhaps incorrect password, or some other type of error. And I’m wondering — what happens, what do you do when that happens? How do you resolve that?**

P: Uh, well I do what I just did to see if there’s another password that my Mac has automatically saved. I hope so. Um, because if not, then I have to go and find my password-protected file and look up in there. And hopefully I remembered to save it. Um, like many combat Veterans, I have cognitive and some memory issues uh, with multiple TBIs etc. And toxic exposure issues. Um, so you know, remembering passwords even if it’s simple is not going to happen with me. So that’s what I would do. And all of that of course adds to the frustration of you know, again, in this example, I just need to know is my lab fasting or not? And then I get all the way here and, you know, I still can’t find it. I guess I’m going to call them. I guess. And why I need, this is crazy. I mean, why that’s even...somebody thought to put a message there. Why in the world would I need to be 30 minutes early for a lab appointment at VA? I mean, that’s probably outside the scope of this, but if my appointment is at, you know, at 11:15 which is even hard to tell that’s what...I guess that’s a time over here. It’s not even clear. Those should be the biggest as well. But if my appointment is 11:15 then I’m going to be there in time for 11:15.

**M: Mhm.**

P: Add to calendar? I don’t know. I don’t want to go into my calendar to explore all that. But I’m gonna click it, I’m curious what happens. Okay. So I could allow downloads. And it looks like it’ll allow me downloads. So it looks like it’s adding it to my calendar. That’s new since the last time I logged in. In a week or two weeks ago, that’s great.

**M: So [name], we talked about a lot today and I kind of wanted to roll out a silly question and see how you, what you think about it. So if you imagine that I could give you a magic wand and you could change anything about the process of logging into these, to these accounts, um, or setting up these accounts...what would you change?**

*[35:05]* P: One login. One VA, one login. Everything accessible from right there, from a single button, and everything’s super clear. And so everything I need to do is all visible on one page, or I click on some broader thing that describes what I’m looking for or hover over it and then it takes me to one more and then I’m exactly where I need to be. And to back up for a moment, so the next thing I would want to do if we were in this is I’ve figured out appointments but now I want to check, I want to refill a prescription. I don’t even know how to get back there from here. So I clicked on the back button...I don’t even know how to get to prescriptions from here. So I guess I’m gonna go to up in here to “get care.” Okay. I don’t know where prescriptions is. So it’s not in care, maybe in treatment facilities? I don’t know where, there’s nothing on here for prescriptions which under “Get Care” would be the sort of like the number 1 thing I’m trying to do. I don’t know. I’m going to go back to the main MyHealtheVet screen and see what happens there. Is it going or not? I can’t tell. I guess it is. Health records, pharmacy. Refill VA prescriptions, I’m clicking on it. I guess it’s going. Scrolling on down, okay. And here’s my prescriptions. So great. So I can get it. Um, and in prescriptions it should be very clear what’s, you know, I’d like to see two separate sets of things. Active prescriptions and inactive prescriptions and click on the active first and only bring up the active. And sometimes things drop off and so I need to be able to access inactive so I can find a way to refill them. To me, those are the two most important things in MyHealtheVet. I don’t use anything else. I use three things. I use refill prescriptions, I use check my appointments, and I use um, the third one is secure messaging.

**M: Mhm.**

P: And that’s a jumble as well. That needs to be more user friendly, as well.

**M: Gotcha. Is there anything that we haven’t talked about today regarding logins that you think we should know?**

P: Uh, only for Veterans, I don’t know. I’m not doing myself but for claims, um, people really want to know the status of their claims. And that should be super user friendly, and there should never be outages. It should be really clear. And frankly, you know, if VA needs to do a survey to find out. Maybe you can tell from, you know, if you have technology monitoring what people want to use the most. I mentioned the things that I use the most, you know, in MyHealtheVet it’s those three things. And in DoD logon, as a Veteran not actively pursuing a claim, it’s letters. I would think the next biggest one is for, you know, for claims. But have all of those things, you know, whatever gets used the most. Put that as the absolutely most visible. It shouldn’t look like a book when we’re on here.

**M: Yeah, definitely. This has been really, really helpful. We really thank you for walking us through all these various pages and for giving us your thoughts on this.**

P: Yes. Happy to do it. Things like this, as well, don’t make them blue. That should be red. You know, if I want to check it. One more piece I want to add in here, as well. This “self-entered medications and supplements.” You can self-enter a bunch of data. That makes no sense to me. I don’t even understand why you do it. If you self-enter it, only if your caregiver actually has access to it should it be on there. Otherwise, what’s the point of self entry? Um, here’s another one I just noticed. My medications lists and VA medications lists. I don’t understand. What, why are there two medications lists? I guess one is self-entered which again, makes no sense to me. If, unless, should be medications and I can self-enter. When I go to care providers outside of VA. I’m often able to update in my, in my, in my electronic record. Uh, before I go in, I can, you know, fill out forms. I can make any changes to my health. One of them is especially good. I can update in there any um, symptoms that I’m having before I go to my appointment. And I can update any of my prescriptions and nutraceuticals I’m taking. Over-the-counters, etc. And so it’s all right there and when I check in with the nurse, she goes over everything and it’s already entered in there. So I mean, that would be, that would be very user friendly to do those kinds of things with all of that. But self-entered is a waste of time unless it’s going to actually, my caregiver is actually going to have access to it.

**M: That makes sense.**

*[40:32]* P: I would take it off, frankly. I would end that service entirely. Um, unless, unless there can be a way to be providing it to caregivers. Otherwise, it’s false hope.

**M: Gotcha. So we are at time, [name]. I’m wondering if you have any questions for me before we close out today?**

P: Just curious what the process is here from you know all of this you’re gathering from all the Veterans that are participating in this. Well first of all, have you gotten your sufficient number for participants?

**M: That’s a good question. We are almost there. You are certainly helping us get to that direction.**

P: Great. And then what happens when the, do you compile everything? What happens from there?

**M: Exactly. So we speak to, you know, our end group like you mentioned, and then we’re doing essentially the same thing that we did here today. Gathering, you know, kind of the what we call qualitative or you know, peoples’ accounts and their experiences of these processes. And then we compile those, synthesize that together, and from there we generally have recommendations for things that should be improved upon. And so those then get handed off to the VA.**

P: Okay.

**M: I can’t guarantee, you know, that any one thing you pointed out today will be resolved in a week or so. But I do want to drive home that this has been really useful and helps us to build a case to, you know, make improvements to the systems so that it works better for you and for others.**

P: Yes. Two very quick things that I think should be added as well. I’m just thinking about community care. This should be a button for accessing you know get the care I need. So that you know emergency care should be upfront and center. For how to access that and, you know, people should be able to get all the information they need. If I need something outside of VA that because I’m outside of the mileage or care, I need chiropractic, I need whatever, whatever. There should be something really clear there. And then also for traveling. I live in [state]. Um, ⅔ of [residents] moved here from another state and many of those are snowbirds or travel back to where they used to live for weeks or months at a time. I was doing that for awhile, dual tracking with care in [state and state]. And there should be some kind of a clear button as well for accessing, not just the outside of VA care. Through community care or whatever it’s called now. But also for finding VA facilities if you’re traveling. Say I’m on vacation in Puerto Rico and I need to go to a VA there. There should be a really clear button so I just go to eVA.gov, clikc on a button, I know with confidence that I can, you know, figure out how to find the VA where I’m vacationing in Puerto Rico or Hawaii or wherever.

**M: Mhm. Yeah, that makes sense. Awesome, well again, I really want to thank you for taking the time out to share your thoughts with us today. This has been super useful and helpful for us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for folks like you. If you know of any other Veterans or caregivers or service members who think might be willing to do something like we did today and you would like to forward them onto us, please do so. It’s great to hear from more people.**

**P: Yep. So I’m the [volunteer role] We have a fairly active presence on our Facebook page. If you can send me something that is shareable, even if it’s just text, I would be happy to post it there. And our audience would tap into it. I’m active in a couple Gulf War Veteran groups, so I could share it virally. I share almost daily information that’s of interest to our Veteran audience. And it reaches, I don’t know, you know, collectively between those...and I have a website, [website name], that’s had about a million and a half visitors since its creation. Almost all, presumably, Veterans and those who care for them. So the audience you know in any given day we have i dont know 10,000 Veterans who see what I’m posting. Feel free to share and you have my permission to contact me in the future for any of this as well.

**M: Excellent. Yeah, I will pass that information along an you’ll get a message from the folks who scheduled with you. So not me directly, but the folks who scheduled with you with any follow-up on that.**

*[45:10]* P: Great. I want to thank you as well, for you and everybody else on the phone that’s actually caring enough to try and improve this. I’m really grateful, as well. Obviously, it affects a whole lot of Veterans out there. Not just me, who’s a little, hm...sorry for me being a little frustrated, as well. It’s just, it’s probably, again, the worst online experience I have. So I’m grateful for all of you, to you and everybody else on today for trying to make things better for Veterans.

**M: Yeah, we definitely appreciate that. Well you have a great rest of your day [name], thank you so much.**

P: Thank you again, really appreciate it. Take care. Bye.
