*[moderator reads opening script]*

*[0:13]* **M: What VA websites and applications do you access online?**

P: Uh, the um My HealtheVet, eBenefits, and the DoD login for uh what is it called, I forgot the name of the other one. Let’s see here. There’s one more I use. I can’t remember the name of it but there’s a few of them I use.

**M: Sure. And--**

P: MyAccess, that’s what it is.

**M: What was that, I’m sorry?**

P: MyAccess and MyPay.

**M: Gotcha. And what login accounts do you use for each of those websites?**

P: It’s my husband’s.

**M: Great. I’m wondering would you be comfortable screensharing and kind of walking us through how you log in to each of those websites?**

P: That’d be fine.

**M: Sure. So to screenshare it at the bottom of the zoom application there’s a green button that says share. So you have video now, but if you press the share button again you’ll be able to select either desktop or a browser.**

P: Let’s see, there it is. It says screen here. That should be it now.

**M: Perfect, yeah, so we can see your internet browser right now.**

P: I’m going to close down some of these things here. I was working prior to the call.

**M: Oh, no worries, take your time.**

P: You should be able to see it now.

**M: Yeah.**

P: Here we go.

*[2:45]* **M: Yeah, so, whatever of those websites that you’ve already mentioned that you’d like to go to first, we’re happy to see.**

P: The one I use the most is the My HealtheVet.

**M: Gotcha. How frequently do you use My HealtheVet?**

P: Probably daily. [“This site can’t be reached” error appears] Hmm, I’ve never had that come up before. *[Checks internet connection] [Page loads]* So just log in?

**M: Sure. You mentioned you’ve never had something come up again, what was that?**

P: It was uh the error code for the connection being slow.

**M: Ah, gotcha.**

P: My internet connection.

**M: No worries. And I think I wasn’t quite able to catch, but you said you use My HealtheVet how often?**

P: Daily.

**M: Daily? Gotcha. Great so when you get here [on the “Login to Manage Your Healthcare” page], what do you, how do you log in to this website?**

P: Typically I just go to this log in *[on the left side of the page, Sign in with My HealtheVet]*. Should I go ahead and log in?

**M: Sure. I see you’re using the one on the left, um is there a reason that you choose that one over the other options on the right?**

P: Uh well typically I am on my phone, so I don’t have to do this one too often. 

**M: When you say that you’re typically on your phone and you don’t have to do this too often, could you tell me a little bit more about why you don’t have to do that too often?**

P: Uh just because I have the log in to my phone already. I do most of the checking in off my phone.

**M: Gotcha.**

P: And it’s a little harder to do it on the desktop. Most places we go are the messaging and the pharmacy. We don’t do a whole lot with everything else on here.

**M: Great. Are there ever occasions where you find that you’re not able to log in with the My HealtheVet?**

P: Uh it’ll give an error code stating that um, what do you call it, website upgrades are being made. And then it makes it a challenge to navigate around. But usually it’s not on the date that it says it should be. [audio breakup] the webpage starts going down.

**M: And what do you do when that happens, where you get that error code?**

P: I just have to wait until it comes up again. It won’t let you do anything on there. It’ll just highlight orange up here in the top. 

**M: How often would you say that that happens?**

P: Probably every other month or so. It’s system updates or system upgrades. 

**M: Great. Would you be willing to walk us through any of the other websites that you use regularly?**

*[6:54]* P: Sure. The next one I use most often is probably eBenefits *[searches google for eBenefits]*

**M: How often do you use eBenefits?**

P: Um, pretty much any time we need to file something, so a couple times a month. See this is one of [audio breaks up; mouse gesturing to the “outage calendar” banner at the top of the page]

**M: Yeah, tell me a little bit about--**

P: The outage calendars

**M: Sorry to interrupt you there. Yeah, tell me a little bit more about what that banner is telling you, and you know what that means for you when you log in.**

P: Uh, usually they have the outage calendar, um it says you can link it at the bottom. Um but usually the link, it’s down here, typically the dates aren’t exact, so like this one is pretty much ongoing for about a year. Um, so it’s hit or miss for whether the calendar will actually, or if the page will actually look this way. You can see it started February 13 this year, and it’s scheduled to go to January 1st of next year. So it’s kind of a blanket excuse on why the webpage isn’t working, in my opinion.

*[8:22]* **M: How often, you said you come here a couple times a month, how often out of those you know visits would you say that the site is down or you aren’t able to log in?**

P: So a lot of what we do on here is compensation um or um filing and checking on forms, making sure they’re being processed. Um so probably if I’m on here seven times, a good three of them may have to delay due to them not working. 

**M: And if it isn’t working, you know, besides just waiting is there anything else that you’re able to do to kind of troubleshoot that?**

P: No, not that I’ve found. I’ve tried calling, and I end up on hold for 2-3 hours. It has a contact button up here, but nobody ever answers. And then all they give you is by phone, you can do the online chat but usually they’re quick to answer the first message, but then it’s probably 4-5 minutes between answers per question. So it just seems like it takes too long.

**M: Gotcha.**

P: Or they just tell me that I need to call anyways. [audio breaks up] And then it says you can visit in person but our closest benefits office is about two and a half hours away. So that’s not really an easy option for us.

*[10:14]* **M: Right. Do you recall what the process of setting up this account was like?**

P: Uh, for us it was challenging. Um, just because my husband’s account kept having to get, what do they call it, authorized? So we weren’t able to see all of this or on the My HealtheVet, where it says Premium here? You have to be authorized to get the Premium, which then allows you further access into everything else, and it took probably two years to get his account finally authorized, and having to go into the office multiple times to get it authorized, and they would say that was completed but we’d go to log in again and we’d run into the same wall. We finally had to go down to, I believe that was the one where we went to the medical records office and he was able to just push a button right there in his office, he had access to everything.

**M: Yeah, what’s all involved in getting authorized?**

P: Uh, theoretically they give you a um a login and you’re supposed to be able to log in with their code that they give you. Um it’s I guess an easy access. But to switch it to the premium, um let’s see if it’ll show you here [clicks on Premium in profile], um we have to do separate steps to get it upgraded to where you can actually do things online. I think before we had this Advanced account. Um [audio breaks up] let’s see if they have it on here. They don’t have the option on here anymore. [scrolls through My HealtheVet account types page]

**M: What is it that you’re looking for here?**

P: Uh looks like this one [Advanced] they used to have it where you could just see your base information. Let’s see, oh yeah here’s a Basic account here. That’s where you have to switch off of to be able to do anything on your My HealtheVet account or your DoD eBenefits. It slowed that down as well.

**M: Gotcha. And you said that process to get to you know that Premium account was about two years for My HealtheVet, is that correct?**

P: Yes.

*[13:00]* **M: Gotcha. DId you have to do anything similar for your DS Logon account?**

P: Uh, the DS Logon we have to redo the password about, I think it’s every 60 or every 90 days. So if you forget it, um, which was happening with my husband, he kept forgetting his login so we had to go and then reset his entire login multiple times in order to just reset the basic 60-90 day renewal. Um so that’s probably the biggest difficulty we’ve had with that one. Getting the login and getting it something he can remember. So I take over all of this now.

**M: Yeah, how do you keep track of those passwords if you have to reset them so frequently?**

P: I do a spreadsheet where I put in like the start and the finish of it and I can remember the middles. But usually I try to pick something that’s relevant to us. But you have to do so many characters, so many um symbols, so many numbers, so it’s usually something that’s not easy to remember.

**M: Gotcha. Would you be up for you know walking me through the process of how you log in with eBenefits? So we can see what that looks like?**

P: Here we go [clicks to log into eBenefits].

*[14:46]* **M: It looks like it’s kind of taking a while to load; is that pretty typical for you?**

P: Yeah that’s pretty normal. That’s actually a fast load onto a site. Usually you have to consent to having your um page screened. Um and then let’s see. [audio breaks up] Yeah, they recently changed this color, and then this down box they recently, now we don’t have have a CAC card so we log in with his DS Login. And I do this one so many times that my computer has it saved. We’ll see if that’ll work though.

**M: So I saw one of the buttons on that screen said premium account.** DId you have to create your DS Logon into a premium account too?

P: This is My HealtheVet that you have to be authorized for the Premium in order to be Premium on this page, the VA DoD eBenefits. So if you’re not Premium on My HealtheVet you will not be premium on the DoD and you cannot access all of the medical history. Um, so like it says all that, if you’re not premium you’re not able to see all that. Which then makes it difficult to put in claims or get the, say you need to be able to submit compensation claims.

**M: Gotcha. So you kind of had to upgrade one before you could upgrade the other, is that correct?**

P: Yeah. So this one if the My HealtheVet doesn’t work at all, then you can’t um do anything. Now this is the first time I’ve noticed the Advanced, I haven’t seen that before so I’m going to do some research on that. Um to see if we’re eligible for this one. Um but I think they just recently upgraded the system to have the Advanced. But it looks like that’s just for VA patients. Um which we, which my husband is. Um so that’d be something to look into. Because they didn’t have that last month, that I noticed. Yeah, over here [on eBenefits] you’re supposed to be able to put in your dependents, we dealt with the disabilities a lot, historical claims, what’s in progress, what’s been recently filed, and see if they have any updates on that. This is some…

**M: Gotcha. I noticed on the My HealtheVet website there are a couple different options for how to log in. Is there similarly more options for eBenefits?**

*[18:27]* P: No. eBenefits, well you can use your CAC card if you’re active duty, or there is um [audio cuts out] the system without your approval to screen your location. Every time you log in there’s a timestamp, so you can see that up here.

**M: Gotcha.**

P: Up at the top you can see the last login. 

**M: Great. Are there any other websites that you’d like to walk us through.**

P: Let’s see if there’s any that I use. Um the only other one that I can think of is the MyPay, which we don’t use often. *[navigates to MyPay]*

**M: How often would you say you might use it?**

P: Probably a couple times a year. If everything is going correct then we don’t usually touch it too much. It’s kind of challenging because MyPay, eBenefits, and My HealtheVet all do similar things, but you have to go to each one separate to complete a step for the other. Does that make sense?

**M: Yeah I think so. So you know to fully submit a claim perhaps you need to go do something in My HealtheVet before you can submit the claim, is that kind of what you mean?**

P: In order to be able to get the claims into My HealtheVet you have to start with eBenefits, you have to complete the claim, have it completed completely before you can be seen for it at the VA, which will turn into your medical records. So this one, this is a common page for MyPay. [“This site can’t be reached” error page]

*[20:56]* **M: The “This site can’t be reached” error?**

P: Yeah, the timeout error. I would say we almost always hit it.

**M: Gotcha. When you say common, how many times out of when you log into it will you get that?**

P: I would say pretty much every time. It usually takes a few tries before it’ll go. 

**M: What sort of account do you use to log into the MyPay website?**

P: Um it’s the same DoD ID.

**M: The same as eBenefits you mean?**

P: Uh, let’s see. So this one you can do your DoD ID or your CAC card if you’re active. Um I believe [PIV] that’s personal identification, but this one has a separate login if you don’t have your CAC card. My husband made up this name.

**M: I like it. And so this is a different login than the one for eBenefits, is that correct?**

P: Correct.

**M: Gotcha. So how many--**

P: This always gives an error on the first few tries for your login.

**M: So how many accounts would you say that you folks have for all of these different VA services?**

*[22:48]* P: Uh I have seven listed right now. Uh this is the password expiration that I was telling you about [MyPay “Your password has expired” error]. It expires every 60-90 days and I just reset it. Let’s see. I just reset this one I guess it might be 60 days because I reset this one in the summer. So this is one that it has a lot of rules to it, and it can’t be anything that you’ve had before. Cannot be one of your last five passwords. And you can’t use actual words, you can’t use personal information, so pretty much anything that you could remember, no sequenced numbers, letters, or you can’t even put like a J or a K together. So it makes it pretty, oh they update every 150 days now. So it’s pretty challenging to get a new password set. And then you can’t really see it so unless you have really good memory you have to write it down every time you make a new one. 

**M: You mentioned that you use a spreadsheet to keep track of these, is that correct?**

P: I do. Yeah you have to. Yeah, my husband used to write it down on pieces of paper and he would lose them or he has multiple notebooks that he uses for memory, but even with those he loses them often. 

**M: You mentioned seven different types of accounts. I’m wondering, you know that seems like a large number of accounts and like how do you choose which ones to use if you have an option? Or you know just like how do you manage all that?**

P: Well certain ones do certain things so like eBenefits is for compensation and claims, it’s for disabilities, so like if for our house we use the disabilities tab, it kind of lists everything and the percentage ratings that he carries for his service connections. And you can see the combined there. You have the list of things that he deals with, so it’s a nice way to kind of get a blanket idea of the things that they’re saying, there’s way that you can, over here, let’s see, you can add them, so we recently had to add a new one. Some of them, it says there’s no pending, so that means that there’s … should be some in progress. So you can see here there’s open applications, intent to file is one that you plan on filing but you’re just collecting data at this point. And then the Open Claims is [audio cuts] accepted. It looks like something opened this up again. You can see where they’ve been submitted or haven’t submitted on the intents to file. Um so this one should be one of the duplicates that got returned that I should be able to submit. But that’s what you do with eBenefits is basically claims status, filing claims, updating dependants, now for this one if you update the dependants you also have to do it in DoD and MyPay first, and then it’ll update everyone here as well. So it’s kind of redundant on some of these things. My HealtheVet is pretty much all medical. That’s how you email your doctors and talk to the pharmacy or order medications. We’ve never used the Get Care buttons or the Track Your Health things. Pretty much all we do here is messaging the pharmacy and then I make sure our info’s updated and correct. MyPay which is this one that I set a new password for is all just for um finding basically your paystubs.

*[28:55]* **M: Gotcha.**

P: Say that again? You cut out.

**M: Sorry about that. So for any of these accounts, once you’re logging in, are you ever asked to provide like a second kind of authentication like a phone? Like a code sent to your phone or email?**

P: No, once you’re in you’re in. 

**M: Great. So just have a couple of final questions. We’ve moved through a lot of what we wanted to look at today really quickly so thank you for that. Um, you could imagine-- pardon?**

P: I said I have to get on these a lot. I’m pretty proficient at it.

**M: Yeah it seems like it. So just have another question you know, this is kind of a fun one so you can feel free to get creative with it. If I could give you a magic wand and you could change something about this process of getting VA accounts or logging in, what would it be?**

P: Are you still there?

**M: I am, are you able to hear me?**

P: I am now.

**M: Great. Should I repeat the question? Were you able to hear that?**

P: I got as far as you starting the question.

**M: Not a problem. So if I gave you a magic wand and you could change something about the process of getting a VA account or logging in, what would it be?**

P: If we could streamline all this into one spot to see everything, so there’s not you know seven different logins or seven different portals that you have to go through to see everything. Because at this point I get a little confused on which one I’m supposed to be working on and that takes up a lot of time trying to figure out which one to use for which problem. Because some of them you use a DS Login, others you use a base login that’s made up, um, see there’s two that use a separate login separate from the DoD login. Let’s see, one, two, three of them that use a different login. So if we could streamline that all to have one central location for everything, I think that would make it much easier to see what part of the process we’re in.

*[31:48]* **M: Yeah that makes a lot of sense to me. You know you mentioned that you sometimes will struggle with which login to use for which account, like how do you figure that out?**

P: Well I have them in a spreadsheet that basically is broken down to what website I use, I have um the web address, the username and password, which site, and what each one of them is meant to accomplish, built into a spreadsheet. So if I didn’t have that I would be pretty lost.

**M: Right. Great, so just a couple of last questions then. Is there anything we haven’t talked about today that you think I should know?**

P: No, I think that’s pretty much it. I can’t think of anything else. Um, actually, there is something. Having the pharmacy dates correct in the system. We have, let’s see if you can see this here. The tracking list versus the date things are actually sent, doesn’t match. So what they’re going off of is um dates uh requested, so like if you request a medication in the system, it puts a date requested or refill submit date. You can see it here. [on MHV] [audio cuts out] the actual fill date. What doesn’t make sense is the duration between these two. So for example this one right here is meant to be a 30-day one, it says it’s active refill in process, but we don’t know whether it’s being sent this month or if it’s being sent in December. Does that make sense?

**M: Yeah, I can see how that would be confusing, you’re not exactly sure when you’ll get your prescriptions refilled based on this chart.**

P: Correct. And you can see it’s kind of a broken chart so you can’t even get to all the links. And if you pan back on it, the link is still broken. So the chart isn’t even a complete chart so you can’t get to all the buttons required to submit it without having to go through a scroll.

**M: Gotcha, I see. Yeah I can see how that would be frustrating.**

P: I mean even if, we’re on desktop now, but even on a cell phone it makes it difficult to see everything. LIke the correlation between the phone tracking versus desktop doesn’t [audio disrupts] easier to see. On a phone this is drastically different. So there’s no comparison online versus phone use. I use the phone a lot just because it makes it a little more streamlined. But on the phone you can’t use your blue button, which is all of your medical records. You have to be on the desktop for that.

**M: Gotcha. Great. Well did you have any final thoughts or questions for me?**

P: No, I think that’s it.

**M: Awesome. Well we really really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today and walk us through these sites. This has been really useful and your feedback is helpful as we continue to work on these sites and make it useful to veterans. If you know any veterans or caregivers who might be willing to do like we did today, we’re happy to forward you a little blurb that you can pass onto them.**

P: Sure, I’ll see if there’s anyone who can be connected.

**M: Great, well we appreciate that and thank you so much again for taking the time out of your day and I hope you enjoy the rest of your day, and please thank your husband for his service on our behalf. Great, thank you again. Take care.**

P: You too. Thank you.
