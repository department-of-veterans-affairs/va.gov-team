## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Lauryl Zenobi and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about your experiences setting up VA accounts and logging into VA websites. Specifically, we’re interested in your experiences with DS Logon. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?**

## Warm-up Questions

Let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

- What VA websites or application do you access online? How do you login to each of those websites? 
  - I used the DS login to essentially look at my VA benefits, my GI Bill, any disability applications or tracking
  - I tried using it one time to book an appointment at a VA clinic but I found it a bit clunky
  - DS Logon is the only login service he uses 
- Are there VA services or benefits that you are unable to access online?
  - I can’t really think of any...um, yeah.

## Credentialing processes

- How did you get your login account(s)? Can you walk me through that process?
  - Set up in 2013 
  - My boss at the time told me to use my CAC card. I think it’s called ? account. I used that one for everything for a few years.
- Did you have to do identify verification? What was that process like?
  - Initially when you set up the regular login, because it’s been awhile. It asks you for some PII - your social security number and your name I think. I had to go into my settings and use my CAC card, because it’s a DoD system, to verify that it was me. I didn’t think it was that hard.
  - I work for an IT department so I think I’m relatively tech-savvy. 
  - I used the online system to look at my GI Bill benefits.
- Have you had to get multiple types of accounts for logging into VA sites?
- What was an instance where you needed to set up another account?
- What has been your experience with DS Logon? ID.me? My HealtheVet? With other types of accounts?
- What level of trust do you have with these logins?
- As an active-duty service member, what sort of online account(s) did you have? How does the VA account process compare to other online accounts that you’ve set up?

## Log-on processes

- Would you be comfortable with screen-sharing your login process with me and talking me through how you login?
  - I use an authenticator app
  - Yeah, you’re able to use an authenticator app with DS Logon
  - I don’t remember what the deal is, why I don’t use VA.gov
  - I tried signing in once using ID.me and I was never able to figure out how to do it
    - I don’t remember why it didn’t work, this was last year
    - I got a little confused
      - There are three login options and I wasn’t sure which one was which
      - I tried creating it...right now, I think it works
      - I guess I can use both now. But at the time, it didn’t work
- Which VA site do you log into most often?
  - I just use VA.gov
- [For veterans] Do you have others that log on for you (like a care-giver or a VCO)? Tell me about some instances when you would have someone log in for you. 
- Have you ever worked with a VCO/VCO representative? Why? What was that process like?
- [For care-givers] Are there instances where you’ll use someone else’s login? Tell me about that process.
- When you log in, are there multiple options for how to log in? If so, which do you use? Why do you choose that option?
  - I don’t think there’d be a reason for me to use one over the other
  - I don’t see a difference between them. Is there supposed to be a difference between the two?
  - Honestly, I think i’d just do both. It seems more straightforward, I can just use my authenticator app
    - I chose to use an auth app for security purposes
    - Honestly, I’ve used the same laptop for 6 years
    - Better safe than sorry...I need a password and just in case there’s a breach
    - The authenticator is relatively easy to do
      - I don’t remember how I initially set it up, though
      - I’d venture to say I think I was prompted for it
      - Not 100% sure
  - DS Logon seems a little more archaic
  - ID.me is just a tiny bit more straightforward
  - But if there’s a difference in access, I’m not sure what it is. Maybe that’s something I could learn a little more about
- Have you ever found yourself unable to log in?
  - I don’t think I ever have had [trouble] with DS logon
  - I think navigating it can be a challenge, once logon is complete
  - Let’s see I want to check my disability rating
  - There used to be “My Disability Rating” on the left hand side. I’m not sure where that is anymore
- How often does this occur? 
- What do you do when this happens?
- Once you provide your login credentials, are you asked to provide a second form of authentication, like a code sent to your phone or email? What do you think of that?
- What’s your level of trust with DS Logon?
  - I’d say it’s relatively high level of trust
  - With all the security breaches happening, it’s nice to have the 2FA
  - I was involved in the OPM breach so someone has all my information
  - When I have all my information when I login, that just makes me feel a bit better

## Final questions

- If you had a magic wand and could change something about the process of getting a VA account or logging in, what would it be?
  - Facial recognition instead of just trying to login
  - Kind of like the iPhone does now...it would make it a lot easier
  - So click sign in...not that we need more options here
    - But some sort of biometric option to help me sign in
    - That would be nice, I think
    - I think it would be a little more secure, knowing you’re the person behind the computer
      - Rather than just 2FA
- Is there anything we haven’t talked about today that you think I should know?
  - I think there should be a VA version of the CAC card
  - That might be helpful for Veterans so they could use it elsewhere
      - Other websites, obviously VA.gov, could use it when you go to VA also
      - That kinda thing
      - Essentially when using any VA system, it would add another layer of physical security if you have a VA ID

- Any questions for me? 
  - Was this conversation just about DS logon? It seemed narrow in scope
      - I think getting a DS logon account was straightforward
      - It wasn’t particularly difficult
  - I was told I’d be able to do more things online if I upgraded to a premium account
  - I prefer to do things that make sense online
  - The closest VA is an hour away
      - It’s not a VA hospital, just a VA clinic
  - I didn’t know what the specifics were, for what I could do online
  - It took me an extra 5 minutes to upgrade to a premium account, that was it

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
