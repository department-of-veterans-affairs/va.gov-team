## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Lauryl Zenobi and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about your experiences setting up VA accounts and logging into VA websites. Specifically, we’re interested in your experiences with DS Logon. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?**

## Warm-up Questions

Let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

- What VA websites or application do you access online? How do you login to each of those websites? 
  - Primarily MHV
    - Renew prescriptions, direct messaging with providers
  - eBenefits sometimes to generate letters
  - VA.gov for various things
  - Applying for a mortgage, needed some letters to verify my disability compensations
    - Trying to access those letters was awful, it crashes frequently
    - Trying to login using DS Logon is extremely frustrating
      - Particularly the requirement to change your password
      - The password requirements are ridiculous
      - I started using the mac feature to autofill passwords, but it doesn’t work on DS Logon
      - I have to save my password to a spreadsheet
      - It’s the most awful process
      - Sometimes it doesn’t work; I’ve had to regenerate a password repeatedly
      - The system was down one night when I was trying to generate the letters (about two weeks ago)
      - Any government website always has antiquated login system and things don’t work right, they’re all broken. Frankly it’s extremely frustrating
      - DS Logon is awful and it needs to be streamlined and easier to use
      - The integration between different sites that use DS Logon is awful
        - I shouldn’t have to log in multiple times; once I’m logged in I should be logged in, period.
      - It’s not user-friendly at all
    - “I’ll put it in simple terms: using DS Logon is one of the worst online experiences I have, period.”
- Are there VA services or benefits that you are unable to access online?

## Credentialing processes

- How did you get your login account(s)? Can you walk me through that process?
  - It was a long time ago, but I believe I had to do it more than once, which has not been very fun
- Did you have to do identify verification? What was that process like?
- Have you had to get multiple types of accounts for logging into VA sites?
  - Why is there more than one login to do VA stuff? It should just be one
- What was an instance where you needed to set up another account?
- What has been your experience with DS Logon? ID.me? My HealtheVet? With other types of accounts?
- What level of trust do you have with these logins?
- As an active-duty service member, what sort of online account(s) did you have? How does the VA account process compare to other online accounts that you’ve set up?

## Log-on processes

- Would you be comfortable with screen-sharing your login process with me and talking me through how you login?
  - This whole screen [on the eBenefits homepage] is a massive jumble of stuff
  - There shouldn’t be an outage event! Why in the world is there an outage event? If Amazon never has outage events, why does eBenefits? I thought that went away in the 1980s
  - It’s super, super, super slow
  - All of this stuff [on the login page]: is it really necessary? When I needed the information I needed, I couldn’t get it. That’s just unacceptable.
  - When I click on the username field, it won’t let me enter things
    - I didn’t remember to check the little box, which is unclear
  - I can never remember my password, and it won’t let my mac autofill for me
  - Having to change the password all the time is, in a word, stupid
  - The VA is always asking to upgrade to a premium account; what is a premium account? I should either log in or I can’t. Who cares? This isn’t relevant to my experience
  - I wasn’t able to autofill before, and now for some reason I can, after being on this page for three minutes
- Which VA site do you log into most often?
- [For veterans] Do you have others that log on for you (like a care-giver or a VCO)? Tell me about some instances when you would have someone log in for you. 
- Have you ever worked with a VCO/VCO representative? Why? What was that process like?
- [For care-givers] Are there instances where you’ll use someone else’s login? Tell me about that process.
- When you log in, are there multiple options for how to log in? If so, which do you use? Why do you choose that option?
  - On MHV I use the MHV login because I have no idea how to get to the others and ID.me never works for me
  - I would rather log in directly to MHV because the DS Logon experience is so frustrating
- Have you ever found yourself unable to log in?
  - Often get the “wrong password” error
    - I see if there’s another password saved in my password manager, and if that doesn’t work I go to my password spreadsheet and look there
    - I have memory issues from combat so remembering passwords is difficult
- How often does this occur? 
  - Most of the times I’ve tried to login in the last few months
- What do you do when this happens?
  - “I suppose I would call them”
- Once you provide your login credentials, are you asked to provide a second form of authentication, like a code sent to your phone or email? What do you think of that?

## Final questions

- If you had a magic wand and could change something about the process of getting a VA account or logging in, what would it be?
  - One VA, one login, everything accessible there from a single button and everything super clear
    - I can see everything on one page
- Is there anything we haven’t talked about today that you think I should know?
  - People really want to know the status of their claims, and that should be super user-friendly and there should be no outages
- Any questions for me? 
  - Curious what the process is for gathering the information

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
