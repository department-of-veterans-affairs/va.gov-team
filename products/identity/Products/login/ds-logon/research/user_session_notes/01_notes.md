## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Lauryl Zenobi and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about your experiences setting up VA accounts and logging into VA websites. Specifically, we’re interested in your experiences with DS Logon. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?**

## Warm-up Questions

Let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

- What VA websites or application do you access online? How do you login to each of those websites?
  - Myhealthevet
  - Used a website to dispute a claim (not sure what it’s called)
  - Myhealthevet login doesn’t work, have to go to the military login
  - MHV says it doesn’t recognize me and I haven’t tried to fix it
- Are there VA services or benefits that you are unable to access online?
  - No

## Credentialing processes

- How did you get your login account(s)? Can you walk me through that process?
  - I logged on to it
- Did you have to do identify verification? What was that process like?
  - When I log on, very seldom does it ask me to identify my identity
  - The one that I log on with changes my password frequently 
  - The one I log into is the premium option and it gives me a desktop and I go to whichever [feature] I’m looking for
- Have you had to get multiple types of accounts for logging into VA sites?
- What was an instance where you needed to set up another account?
- What has been your experience with DS Logon? ID.me? My HealtheVet? With other types of accounts?
- What level of trust do you have with these logins?
- As an active-duty service member, what sort of online account(s) did you have? How does the VA account process compare to other online accounts that you’ve set up?

## Log-on processes

- Would you be comfortable with screen-sharing your login process with me and talking me through how you login?
  - Click on login
  - Use a sign-in partner, sign in with DS Logon, accept
  - “Then it tells me not to put anything on here that would upset the boss”
     - “It’s telling me different things I can do to verify my identity”
     - I have a premium DS Logon account
     - I don’t have a CAC card because I’m retired
     - When you’re finished, close, so that you don’t lose your information to some hacker
     - I have been hacked before
  - I did in-person ID proofing many years ago
     - They looked at my VA card
     - I think I had to provide a DD214
     - Someone came along and validated it, wherever I signed up
     - I don’t think they required any further information because I was already receiving benefits and I was already in the system
  - Other VA accounts
     - The one I had to use when I was increasing my VA disability
     - I generally go to MHV and the other one [VA.gov, maybe], MHV more than the other one
  - When I use my DS Logon, I can get onto every account I want to
     - I can log onto any of those accounts, but I use MHV [most often]
     - I don’t use [VA.gov] much anymore because there’s no reason to
       - Used to use it when I was tracking claims and applying for an increase in disability benefits
     - When I go to DS Logon, I can go to a different series of sites available under DS Logon, one of which is MHV
       - My password for MHV doesn’t work and when I try to recover it they say they can’t find my account
       - I don’t feel like messing with it, since I can use my DS Logon
         - I always use the sign-in partner
  - I enter my username and password and hit “login” and it goes to my MHV dashboard
  - I don’t have a CAC card anymore because I retired from working for the government
  - I have to click “use a sign-in partner”, “accept”, and then log in. It’s a three-step process
- Which VA site do you log into most often?
- [For veterans] Do you have others that log on for you (like a care-giver or a VCO)? Tell me about some instances when you would have someone log in for you. 
  - No	
- Have you ever worked with a VCO/VCO representative? Why? What was that process like?
   - No
- [For care-givers] Are there instances where you’ll use someone else’s login? Tell me about that process.
- When you log in, are there multiple options for how to log in? If so, which do you use? Why do you choose that option?
- Have you ever found yourself unable to log in?
- How often does this occur? 
- What do you do when this happens?
- Once you provide your login credentials, are you asked to provide a second form of authentication, like a code sent to your phone or email? What do you think of that?
  - No
  - The only time I get a third screen is when my password is set to expire
  - All my passwords are remembered on my computer, I don’t know if that’s a good thing or a bad thing
  - I have three levels of security on my computer, so I’m pretty sure I’m safe with that
  - My name has been hacked in the VA once, my OPM, a couple of credit cards were hacked, my security clearance was hacked but I don’t think it’s ever been used
  - Most of my information that is available on [MHV] is my health information, which I don’t know why anyone would want that anyway
  - I like DS Logon. When I do log in through DS Logon I’m logging in through a different website. My username and password is protected through DS instead of VA [?]. The VA doesn’t have a username and password for me so they don’t capture my logon, they only capture that I was on the website
    - I think they [DS Logon] have a more secure logon procedure than MHV
    - It makes me feel better to know that I’m logging in through DS Logon than MHV
      - It’s a personal thing, nothing proven I’m sure
    - DS Logon is limited to people who are currently working for the government or have before, whereas the VA website is for any veteran, so it just feels like one level higher than the VA logon

## Final questions

- If you had a magic wand and could change something about the process of getting a VA account or logging in, what would it be?
  - DS Logon is difficult at best to remember
    - Requires me to put in my new password before I can log on again
    - In other words it starts all over again
    - In some cases it doesn’t capture my new password in my password locker and I have to remember what it is
    - Changes their requirements every 3-4 months
    - I think the biggest thing you can do in protecting a password is not use it over and over again
    - For some websites I’m very careful with how I log on, for others not as much
  - I think DS Logon is pretty easy to use except for remembering the password
    - They don’t tell you that you have to remember it until you’ve already forgotten it
  - If you’ve forgotten it they send an email to your email address to go to the page where you can create a new password
    - If I’ve forgotten my password the first thing I have to remember is my username
    - I believe they’ll send that to your email if you answer security questions
- Is there anything we haven’t talked about today that you think I should know?
  - I would like to see more VA opportunities under MHV including perhaps a direct link to apply for benefits or increase your benefits because I think too many websites get confusing for people and if you have something like major PTSD and you’re trying to do all this stuff it can get frustrating. If the VA had just one website with a menu of different possibilities … then I think it might be a little bit easier if that automatically send you to the other websites instead of having to log into each one
- Any questions for me?

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
