# Canned Responses to Frequently Asked Questions from Users about Identity

Whether from UserVoice or feedback@va.gov emails, we average 1-2 questions per day that do not go directly to the Vets.gov Help Desk.  

These questions typically address one of the following areas, so we typically reply using the following canned responses written in plain language.  It's ok to modify these slightly depending on what individuals are asking, but 95% of the time these will work as-is.

## General Proofing Issues with ID.me Error Code and Desire for More Info

Thank you for your feedback! We’re sorry you’re having difficulties verifying your account. Protecting Veteran data and privacy is a top priority for VA. We’re working with our partners to ensure all Veterans are able to achieve the highest level of identity proofing called a level of assurance 3 certification (LOA3). This keeps your private information private by confirming that you are you — and not someone pretending to be you. 

The VA has partnered with ID.me to become first federal agency to meet the LOA3 standard of the National Institute of Standards and Technology. ID.me is a leader in the field of online security and a Veteran-owned business. 

Receiving an error code during the process happens to about 1 out of 4 users. This is normal for trying to reach LOA3. Issues can come up for a number of reasons ranging from an image that can’t be read by the system to a mismatch in addresses on official records. A large number of these issues can be resolved by calling the Vets.gov Help Desk at 1-855-574-7286, Monday – Friday, 8 am – 8 pm (ET). Please give the Help Desk team the error code and they’ll be help you directly.

## General Proofing Issues - Additional Snippets to Use

* There are a number of reasons passport images can’t be processed. When the system couldn’t process your image, it should have displayed a specific error message with some numbers and letters in a format like “E0000-XXXXXX”. If you call the Vets.gov Help Desk at 1-855-574-7286, Monday – Friday, 8 am – 8 pm (ET) and give them that error code and they’ll be able to help you directly.

* You’re correct, and we’re actively working with our partner to ensure that international phone numbers can be used in the identity proofing process.

* You’re correct, and at this time we aren’t able to provide the highest level of identity assurance to Veterans using foreign addresses. We are working hard to be able to provide this ability as soon as possible.

## Confusing Instructions

Thank you for your feedback! We’re working with our partners to ensure instructions for the identify proofing process are clear during all steps of the process so that everyone can move through the process more efficiently. If you’re a Veteran and would like to participate in a website feedback session to help us make sure that Vets.gov is helpful and easy to use, please contact our team at feedback@va.gov.


## I Don't Have a Smartphone, What Do I Do?

Thank you for your feedback! It is possible to complete the identity proofing process without using a smartphone. To do so, you’ll still need to have access to a computer with an internet connection and a landline or mobile phone. Instructions for this process can be found at https://support.id.me/hc/en-us/articles/229334788  

I’ve also summarized the steps here.  

1) Go to Vets.gov and click the link to “Register”.  A pop-up window will appear. (Make sure any pop-up blocker you have is turned off for this step.)

2) In the pop-up window, you can start the creation of your account by either logging in to an existing Facebook, Google, PayPal, LinkedIn, or DS Logon account OR by entering your email and a password of your choosing, and then clicking the Sign Up button.

3) A confirmation code will be sent to your email address. Enter that code to continue. This step is used to verify that you have requested to create this account and not someone else.

4) Next, you will be asked to enter your name, address, and date of birth. This information is used to begin the identity proofing process. Make sure this information matches what is on your government issued ID. For example, if you go by “Tony,” but your legal first name is “Anthony,” make sure to enter “Anthony” as your first name. 

5) You will then be asked to enter a phone number -- either mobile or home phone. Please note that the address on the phone bill must match the address you entered in step #4. This information is used to further validate that you are the one requesting a secure, identity proofed account, and not someone else.

6) If the phone is accessible to you, click the "Yes, Let's Continue" button -- this will lead to a series of questions solely used to verify your identity.

7) After successful completion of these questions, you will be asked to enter/re-verify a phone number that you can access -- this can be a landline or mobile phone. 

8) You will receive a confirmation code via text or over the phone, depending on the type of phone number you have entered. Enter this confirmation code to validate your account.

If, along the way, you see an option to take a picture of your ID or passport and upload it through your phone, this is not a requirement.  If you do not click "Yes, I have my ID"  when that option is shown to you, then you may complete the identity proofing flow without the need for a smartphone.

## I Have an International Address or Telephone Number

Thank you for your feedback! Protecting Veteran data and privacy is a top priority for VA. We’re working with our partners to ensure all Veterans are able to achieve the highest level of identity proofing called a level of assurance 3 certification (LOA3). This keeps your private information private by confirming that you are you — and not someone pretending to be you. 

At this time, we aren’t able to provide this highest level of assurance to Veterans using international addresses or phone numbers, but we’re working hard to be able to provide this as soon as possible. 

If you would like more information about the security and safety of LOA3, please call the Vets.gov Help Desk at 1-855-574-7286, Monday – Friday, 8 am – 8 pm (ET) and the team will help you directly.

## Why Can't I Use a VA Card/PIV/CAC

Thank you for your feedback! Protecting Veteran data and privacy is a top priority for VA. We’re working with our partners to ensure all Veterans are able to achieve the highest level of identity proofing called a level of assurance 3 certification (LOA3). This keeps your private information private by confirming that you are you — and not someone pretending to be you.

At this time, we aren’t able to provide this highest level of assurance to Veterans using only their VA card during the identity proofing process. We will take this suggestion under advisement. If you’re a Veteran and would like to participate in a website feedback session to help us make sure that Vets.gov is helpful and easy to use, please contact our team at feedback@va.gov.

## I Have DS Logon or MHV Account So Why Do I Have to Do This?

Thank you for your feedback! Protecting Veteran data and privacy is a top priority for VA. In this case, we must ask additional questions to verify personal information beyond that provided by a DS Logon Premium account. This is so we’re able to achieve the highest level of identity proofing called a level of assurance 3 certification (LOA3). This keeps your private information private by confirming that you are you — and not someone pretending to be you. 

After verifying your identity the first time, you can use your DS Logon account to access your information. When you use your DS Logon account, you will still be asked to use a second method to prove who you are, such as receiving a text message or phone call with a 6-digit access code to enter. 

If you would like more information about the security and safety of LOA3, please call the Vets.gov Help Desk at 1-855-574-7286, Monday – Friday, 8 am – 8 pm (ET) and the team will help you directly.

## Pop-Ups Are Blocked or Links Don't Work

Thank you for your feedback! We’re sorry that there’s been difficulty in verifying your account. When you click the “Get Started” button, a pop-up window from ID.me should appear so that you can continue the verification process. This window might be blocked by a pop-up blocker or it might not be easy to see. 

We would appreciate it if you would try again. In the meantime, we will continue to work with our design team and partners to ensure the identity verification flow is seamless for all Veterans.  

If you continue to have issues with identity proofing, please call the Vets.gov Help Desk at 1-855-574-7286, Monday – Friday, 8 am – 8 pm (ET) and the team will help you directly.
