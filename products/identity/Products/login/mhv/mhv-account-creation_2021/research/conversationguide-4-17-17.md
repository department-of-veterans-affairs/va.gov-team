# March 2017 Account Creation Test with Blue Button questions

## Goals

- Account Creation
  - Our goal is to test two versions of the flow from after a non-MHV account Veteran logs in to vets.gov and gets LOA3 verified and wants to use view their medical records or RX or SM.
- Blue Button
  - Test assumption that MHV branding on the downloaded health records would be jarring/confusing to veterans.
  - Test assumption that "blue button" is confusing for new account creators.

## Key research questions
- Account Creation
  - Is it clear to the Veteran what they are being asked to do?
  - Is the language for the consent and terms & conditions clear?
  - Can they complete the flow to get access to the tools?
  - Do they understand they can select one without the other? (re medical consent vs t&c) 
- Blue Button
  - Is the MHV and Blue Button branding confusing or jarring?

## Methods
Remote usability testing 
- n = 3 to 5

## Conversation Guide

### Introduction
Thank you for joining us today. My name is [NAME] and we also have [NAME OF OTHERS OBSERVING] observing and taking notes for this session. We are doing this website feedback session on behalf of the team at the Department of Veterans Affairs working to build a new website that will help veterans get easier access to the benefits they deserve.

The team wants to evaluate a draft version of a website today. We want to see what works well, and what doesn’t work well. We're going to show you a website, but it isn't final yet, so if you can tell us what you expect to do on each screen before you do it we can help you through any rough patches. We are especially insterested in places where you don't know how you should answer a question.

Before we begin, I’d like to make a few things clear and explain how the session will work.
* We aren’t testing your ability. We’re just trying to figure out what works well on the website, and what doesn’t work well. So there are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions and what you think so that we can make the site better. I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.
* This entire usability test session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to the next question or task.
* We’ll be recording the screen activities as we look at the site. Recording our discussion today will help us capture everything you say accurately.
* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop, and you will still recieve your $25 thank you.
* As we're going through the session, I'd like you to think out loud.... [demonstrate]

### Warm-up Questions (5 minutes)
To start, I'd like to ask you a few warm-up questions.
- When is the last time you had to agree to terms and conditions on a website before you could do something you were trying to do?
- When is the last time you read the terms and conditions on a website?
- (If never) When is the last time you scanned them for more than 10 seconds?

### Account Creation 
Okay, I'm going to show my screen now and let you drive. 

https://marvelapp.com/3687i59 

Let's say you heard from a friend that you can now see your prescriptions on vets.gov.  You arrive here, [open link] and begin to register for an account. 

First, you will need to register, but after that, where would you go to see your prescriptions?  [have them go through id.me flow, then next page on vets.gov will be terms and conditions/medical consent.]

What is this page? 

Is this what you expected to see?

What are you being asked to do? 

If I wasn't on the call with you, what would you do next? 

[Do they want to select terms and conditons and read it? ] What would you think you would see if you clicked that blue terms and conditions link? What is this page telling you?  [Go back]

If you wanted to view your prescriptions and saw this first, what would you think?  

What else do you notice about this page? 

What else is the site asking you to do? 

What does the next section, VA health information, ask you to do? [if not already at this part]

Would you check that box? 

What will you be able to do if you check that box? 

What information on this page is confusing? 

How would you explain this page to a friend? 

How often do you think you will see this page on this website? 

By accepting to the terms and conditions, what are you agreeing to? 

By checking the add my VA health records to vets.gov account what are you doing? 

Do you think you need to check both boxes to continue?  Would you want to check both boxes?

Let's take a step back and see another way the website might look right after you have just set up your account and logged in for the first time. [pulls up link https://marvelapp.com/5995e2b/screen/26766158 ] 

Can you show me how you would view your prescriptions on vets.gov starting at this point? 

What you would want to do next? 

Why do you think you are seeing this here? 

[use some of the same questions as above] 

What would you do here if I wasn't on the phone with you? 

Tell me about the two different ways you saw the website work today.


### Blue Button

Okay, I'd like to talk about something different for a few minutes.
- Have you tried to get a copy of your medical records, either from the VA or another place? How did that go?
- Let's take a look at what that might look like on a new VA website.
  - Open [Blue Button desktop prototype](https://marvelapp.com/3gadi6d/screen/25002814)  
- If you wanted to get your medical records on this site, how would you do that?
- Follow-ups for any tasks
  - Did that do what you expected?
  - Where else might you look for that?
  - How easy or difficult was that to find?
  - Is there anything else you expected here?
- (At updating screen) What's going on here? How long do you think it'll take? Let me know when you don't want to wait longer.
- (At "PDF" page) Is this what you expected to see? 
  - Where did this information come from?
  - (If they don't mention) Is that the website we were just on?
  - What do you think of the information coming from a different site than we were on before?
- Okay, let's take a quick look at what that might look like if you did it on your phone instead.
  - Open [Blue Button mobile prototype](https://marvelapp.com/2c4ia9i/screen/25581837)  
  - If you wanted to get your medical records on this site, how would you do that?
  - (At size warning) What's going on here? Have you seen something like this before?
  - What do you think of that?
- Now that we've seen how it could work on a computer or phone, overall, how did that go?
  - Were there any parts that were difficult or confusing?
  - Are there any ways this could be better?


### Wrap Up
 - How easy or hard is it to find things on this site in general?
 - Are there any other things I should tell the team?
