1. Who is Experian and how does ID.me use them?

Experian is a credit bureau. A credit bureau is an organization that gathers account information on consumers from various creditors and financial institutions. ID.me uses data from multiple sources including Experian to help verify your identity based on industry standards.  

2. I was told temporary lift my credit freeze.  How do I do that? 

ID.me uses data gathered by Experian, a trusted credit bureau, to help verify your identity. This process does not affect your credit score.  If you have frozen your credit, we can’t verify your identity unless you temporarily lift the freeze. In order to process your identity verification, you need to place a temporary lift on your credit freeze.

When you placed a security freeze on your credit report, you should have been provided with a personal identification number (PIN). If you wish to temporarily lift your freeze, you can do so online at Experian’s Freeze Center using this PIN.

You will be asked to complete a form to lift the freeze for a specified amount of time. We recommend lifting for a minimum of 60 days. Once you have lifted the credit freeze, you can return and complete the verification process in 45 days.

If you do not remember this PIN, you may still remove a security freeze on this site by next answering a few questions verifying your identity.
