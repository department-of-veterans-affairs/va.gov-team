##  Updates as of 6.5.19
**1. Users with Name Changes:** Individuals who had officially changed their names were frequently not successful in online identity proofing. This is because there is often a significant delay in their name change being reflected in financial records, which serve as an authoritative source for identity proofing. We have introduced a new feature for users to provide their previous name, if applicable, and we are now able to pin their identity using either their present or previous names. We will track and monitor data and pass rates to evaluate increased success rates. The screenshot below illustrates this.

**2. Updates to Virtual In-Person Proofing:** We've made a few updates to the Virtual In-Person Identity Proofing solution. Virtual In-Person Identity Proofing is the ID.me product via which, users who are unsuccessful in completing online identity proofing can enter into a video call with a trained and certified ID.me Trusted Referee to complete identity proofing. The call to action UX for users to enter into the Virtual In-Person proofing flow has been made more prominent. We have also launched the "live" Virtual In-Person proofing solution. This allows veterans to enter into a video call with an ID.me trusted referee in real time to complete identity proofing. Alternatively, they can schedule an appointment to meet with the Trusted Referee at a convenient time.  Screenshots below illustrate both of these updates.
