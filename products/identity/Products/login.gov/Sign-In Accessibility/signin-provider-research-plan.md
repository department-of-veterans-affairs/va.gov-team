# Research Plan for [Identity, Sign-in redesign and provider attributes, October 1]
*Questions about how to set up your research study? Reach out in the #research-ops Slack channel.* 

## Background
Briefly describe the background of your product. Consider:
- What problem is your product trying to solve?
- Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)
- What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?

The VA.gov sign-in page is used by millions of Veterans to enable access to VA benefits and services. It is a touchpoint used by every authenticated Veteran and is significant in ensuring the ability of Veterans to seamlessly access services digitally. In the coming months, additional services outside of VA.gov (eg: My HealtheVet) will begin routing users to the VA.gov sign-in page, to ensure a consistent authentication experience across VA web properties.



### OCTO-DE Objectives 
*Note: applicable only to OCTO-DE teams*

Which [OCTO-DE objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

This research directly supports all three OCTO North Stars:
1. Increase the usage and throughput of VA services
2. Decrease the time Veterans spend waiting for an outcome
3. Increase the quality and reliability of VA services

Because reliable and accessible authentication directly gates most VA.gov activity, within specific DE Goals, this research, directly and indirectly, supports nearly all DE Goals, with an emphasis on #2, #3, #4, #6, and #7:

1. Veterans and their families can apply for all benefits online
2. Veterans can manage their health services online
3. Logged-in users can easily track applications, claims, or appeals online
4. Logged-in users can update their personal information easily and instantly
5. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
6. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features
7. Veterans and their families trust the security accuracy and relevancy of VA.gov

### Veteran Journey
Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)?
Are there moments that matter? 

Our product fits in at the start of the Veteran Journey from Serving in the Military through Getting Out and Starting Up.  However, it additionally serves the Veteran throughout their journey because they may receive VA services throughout their life.

**Starting Up**
* Attending to health needs

**Taking care of self**
* Managing primary care and chronic health issues
* Maintaining my health

## Research Goals	
What are you trying to learn from this research? 

*Pro tip: Limit 3 goals per study. If you have more than 3 goals, consider how to break up your research into iterative studies.*

**Sign-in Modal redesign**
1. How will the addition of Login.gov and other design modifications to the VA.gov sign-in modal impact a user's ability to sign in?

**Attributes of government-created and private sector credentials**

2. What information does the Veteran find most important or least important in a sign-in option and which type of credential provider would users prefer given the choice of goverment-created or private sector?


### Outcome
How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?

This research will directly inform design changes to the sign-in page used by millions of Veterans. The usability testing on the design will ensure that familiar workflows, used by Veterans to access all digital services, are easy-to-follow and not impacted by design/copy changes, nor the addition of a new sign-in option.

Additionally, the research will guide public-facing content and VA-stated credential preferences by highlighting those areas most important to Veterans when selecting how they sign in / which credential(s) they use (eg: government vs. the private run, security, accepted at many agencies, etc.)

### Research questions
Consider bucketing research questions under research goals. For each question, think about:
- What will I do with what I learn from this question?
- Does this question serve the goals of my study?
- Do not write out all questions you plan to ask participants -- that should go in the [conversation guide.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/conversation-guide-template.md) 

**Sign-in Modal redesign**

1. What usability issues does the modified design pose to the current sign-in process?
2. Are participants able to quickly locate their current sign in provider?

**Attributes of government-created and private sector credentials**

1. Do users prefer government created credentials or private sector created credentials? 
2. Out of the attributes provided, what information is most and least important when selecting a sign-in provider?
3. What other attributes do users value in a sign-in provider?


### Hypothesis
What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.
- What do you already know about this problem space?
- What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don’t skip this step!)
- Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study. 
- Remember to constrain the hypothesis to the goals of your study!

**Sign-in Modal redesign**
* When presented with changes to the VA.gov sign-in modal, participants will be able to select their desired credential provider.

**Attributes of government-created and private sector credentials**
* When presented with a list of attributes about governemnt-created and privately owned sign-in options, participants will be able to rank their most important and least imporant attributes. 


## Method	
Describe the method you’re planning. You should be able to explain why this method is appropriate for the goals of the research and maturity of the design. 

Examples of common research methods include: 
- Semi-structured interviews - appropriate for generative research
- Contextual inquiry - appropriate for generative research
- Card sorts - appropriate for generative and evaluative research; depending on the study design 
- Tree tests - appropriate for evaluative research
- Usability testing - appropriate for evaluative research
- User acceptance testing (UAT) - required before product release

Additional resources:
- Please review the [PRA primer](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/what-is-paperwork-reduction-act.md) to educate yourself on how PRA impacts the research we do as a government project. 
- Review the [Perigean recruitment guidance](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/perigean-recruiting-guidance.md) to understand how Perigean recruits, and what types of research they can support. 
- If conducting testing on mobile, refer to the [mobile research guidelines.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/mobile-research-guidelines.md)

_**Remote unmoderated**_


We would like to conduct two unmoderated controlled study where participants are invited to participate in the study via email. They will be provided a link to the study in Optimal Workshop as well as a validation code so we may track who has participated and so that participants can be compensated. 

**Sign-in Modal redesign**

* The first study will be a Chalkmark first-click test in Optimal Workshop. Users will be tasked with signing in to determine if they are able to locate their sign in provider give the design changes to the modal. At the end participants will be provided a validation code (also in Optimal Workshop).

**Attributes of government-created and private sector credentials**

* The second study will be a closed card sort in Optimal Workshop. Where participants will be asked to rank attributes of sign-in providers by most important to least important. At the end participants will be provided a validation code (also in Optimal Workshop). 

An unmoderated study prevents bias. We are interested in how Veterans interact with the sign-in modal when no one is providing support or guiding their thoughts. 

We have a small sample-size moderated study with Veterans planned for Fall 2021. Details for that study will be provided in that study’s research plan.



### Location
Where will you be holding the research sessions? Be sure to include whether this is remote or in-person research. [Learn more about setting up in-person research.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/planning-in-person-research.md)

If remote, include your preferred video conferencing software. Choice of: Zoom, GoTo Meeting; WebEx.

## Recruitment	

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers. 

Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources. 
- [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/perigean-recruiting-guidance.md) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
- [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of marginalized Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach
Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them? 

Pro tip:
- For remote moderated studies with Veterans and caregivers, we recommend using Perigean to recruit participants. 
- Perigean cannot recruit VA employees or VSOs. Work with your VA lead to recruit these groups. 
- Perigean can also support remote, unmoderated studies, however, these studies require strict recruitment requirements. (Additional guidance forthcoming; reach out to #research-ops in the interim.)

Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using the Lean MVS strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more. [Use the recruitment checker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity. *Note: this template will be moving outside of Google Sheets so it is accessible on the VA network.*

**Our intended audience:**

* Veteran users who primarily use VA.gov to sign in are our intended audience. We’ll be using Perigean to help us recruit for these user groups. 

_would like to include a screenshot of the VA.gov homepage to ensure we are reaching the correct user group_


### Recruitment criteria
List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study.

We require 180 participants, Group A (First Click Test) and Group B (Card Sort) with 10 participants in each segment:

**Group A- DS Logon:**
* Segment #1: 10 participants who sign in with DS Logon AND are new to va.gov (2 years or less)
* Segment #2: 10 participants who sign in with DS Logon AND are infrequent users of va.gov (once a year)
* Segment #3: 10 participants who sign in with DS Logon AND are frequent users (i.e. dependent on claims etc. or who visit va.gov daily or weekly)

**Group B- DS Logon:**
* Segment #1: 10 participants who sign in with DS Logon AND are new to va.gov (2 years or less)
* Segment #2: 10 participants who sign in with DS Logon AND are infrequent users of va.gov (once a year)
* Segment #3: 10 participants who sign in with DS Logon AND are frequent users (i.e. dependent on claims etc. or who visit va.gov daily or weekly)

**Group A- MHV**
* Segment #4: 10 participants who sign in with MHV AND are new to va.gov (2 years or less)
* Segment #5: 10 participants who sign in with MHV AND are infrequent users of va.gov (once a year)
* Segment #6: 10 participants who sign in with MHV AND are frequent users (i.e. dependent on claims etc. or who visit va.gov daily or weekly)

**Group B- MHV**
* Segment #4: 10 participants who sign in with MHV AND are new to va.gov (2 years or less)
* Segment #5: 10 participants who sign in with MHV AND are infrequent users of va.gov (once a year)
* Segment #6: 10 participants who sign in with MHV AND are frequent users (i.e. dependent on claims etc. or who visit va.gov daily or weekly)

**Group A- ID.Me**
* Segment #7: 10 participants who sign in with ID.Me AND are new to va.gov (2 years or less)
* Segment #8: 10 participants who sign in with ID.Me AND are infrequent users of va.gov (once a year)
* Segment #9: 10 participants who sign in with ID.Me AND are frequent users (i.e. dependent on claims etc. or who visit va.gov daily or weekly)

**Group B- ID.Me**
* Segment #7: 10 participants who sign in with ID.Me AND are new to va.gov (2 years or less)
* Segment #8: 10 participants who sign in with ID.Me AND are infrequent users of va.gov (once a year)
* Segment #9: 10 participants who sign in with ID.Me AND are frequent users (i.e. dependent on claims etc. or who visit va.gov daily or weekly)
**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 

Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants. Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

Pro tip: The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria. Consider how you could 1) leverage the [lean MVS approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) or 2) break up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria. Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Go to an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md#participants-and-recruitment)

* Participants must use VA.gov as their point of sign-in. NOT https://www.myhealth.va.gov/ or https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
What criteria would strengthen your results? 

## Timeline
If you are using Perigean to recruit please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote research, 2+ weeks for in person. 

* We would like to start the research on October 11th and run it for 2-3 weeks or until 90 participants are met.

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.)

* October 5th

Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email: naomi.marcussen@oddball.io
* Date and time of pilot session: October 7th, 3:30pm

### Research sessions
What dates do you plan to do research? 

* October 11th- October 25th

### Length of sessions
How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours. 
Specify if you want Perigean to schedule the sessions with buffer time (15 minutes recommended) to allow for participants who can't make it on time, or if you might go over time.

* Sessions should be approximately 15 mins or less

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 
Please request enough dates and time slots for the number of requested participants. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). 

* Availibilty is flexible as this will be an unmoderated test
