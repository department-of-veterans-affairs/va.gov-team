## Introduction
Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Amanda or Samuel], and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we are going to talk about the sign-in process for VA.gov. In an effort to put accessibility first, we want to understand what our user’s access needs are and where they appear in the user journey. Today, we want to learn how to improve the sign-in experience for Veterans who use assistive technology. Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

* There are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions, so that we can improve the application and meet Veterans' needs.
* I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.
* This entire session should take about 90 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to the next question.
* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
* In this session, I'll be having you share your Zoom screen so that I can follow along and we'll help you through that.
* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete the analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
    * If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

Start recording.

* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?


## **Warm-up Questions- 10 minutes**

Before we navigate to the website, can you tell me a little about yourself?

* What part of the country do you live in?
* What branch did you serve?
* What type of devices do you use to access VA.gov?
* Can you describe to me how you use your [accessibility tool?]
* How long have you been using your accessibility tool?
* Which account do you use to sign in to the VA.gov site?
    * How did you determine which account you’d be most comfortable using?
        * Follow-on: Do you associate specific credentials with specific areas of VA? or Do use different credentials for different parts of VA? Why?
    * Have you ever signed in to any other government sites (for example Social Security, USAJobs, IRS, or Federal Student Loans)?
        * How is that experience different or similar to VA.gov?


## **Sign-in process - 15-20 minutes:**

* Could you describe to me how you would navigate to the VA.gov site?
* Would you be comfortable with screen-sharing your sign-in process with me and talking me through how you sign in?

**Things to watch for:**

* What assisted technology software do they use?
* If they search, what is that like? What about browsing?
* Pay attention to words and elements through the sign-in process that might be misleading to a no vision or low-vision user.
* How do they interact with the elements of the website?
* How do they interact with navigation if at all?
* How do they switch between content pages using the navigation?


## **Additional questions - 10-15 minutes:**

* How often do you access VA.gov?
* How much time do you typically spend on VA.gov?
* Do you have others that sign in for you (Caregiver? Family member(s)?) Tell me about some instances when you would have someone sign in for you.
* Are there instances where you’ll use someone else’s login? Tell me about that process.
* What are the most important tasks you or other people need to perform when using VA.gov?
* Do you or did you in the past use other websites and resources for the same purpose? 
* What information do you typically need before you sign into the site?
* If you had a question regarding sign-in, do you know who to contact?
    * If yes – how do you know?
    * If not – how would you go about contacting someone?
* How often (if at all) do you run into issues when signing in? What issues have you experienced? What steps do you take in trying to get those issues resolved?
* How would you describe your past and current experience with VA.gov?


## **Final questions - 5-7 minutes:**

* If there were anything you could change about the process of getting a VA account or signing in, what would it be?
* What is working about the sign-in process?
* Is there anything we haven’t talked about today that you think we should consider about the sign-in process?
* What features are missing for assisted technology?
* Is there a way to make the sign-in experience more pleasant?
* What other apps have you seen that worked for login and why were they successful?
* Do you have any questions for me?


## **Thank You and Closing - 2-3 minutes:**

Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans. Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
