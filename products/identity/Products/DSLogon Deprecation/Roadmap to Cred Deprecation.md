# Roadmap to DSLogon Credential Deprecation 

## Problem Summary  
VA is currently maintaining outdated sign-in options‚Äîsuch as **DS Logon**‚Äîthat are **confusing to users** and **not aligned with federal digital identity standards**. Veterans who previously used these legacy credentials now need to transition to modern sign-in methods: **Login.gov** or **ID.me**.

Continuing to offer multiple, redundant credentials leads to:
- Increased support issues and confusion for users
- Higher maintenance costs and tech debt
- Degraded system performance and UX inconsistency

## Veteran-Facing Benefits
- Veterans will use only **Login.gov** or **ID.me**, the VA‚Äôs modern, secure identity providers.
- Reduced friction and confusion during login.
- Fewer support tickets and faster resolution.

## Engineering 
- Architecture overview
- Security overview

## When we're done:

**WHAT WILL IT LOOK LIKE?**

- DS Logon sign-in paths are fully deprecated.
- Veterans use only Login.gov or ID.me to access digital services.
- Simpler, more consistent user sign-in experience.

**WHAT WILL WE MEASURE?**

- Authentication Metrics: 0% of authentications use MHV or DS Logon by 10/1/2025.
- System Health: Increased uptime and reduced incident volume.
- Credential Adoption: Login.gov and ID.me usage grows.

**Monitoring Tools:**
Datadog: Authentication stats & interstitial metrics
Domo: Sign-in transition dashboards
