## Background
Service Level Objectives, or SLOs, are measurable goals over a period of time that are agreed upon within a Service Level Agreement (SLA). They serve as the individual promises made by the Identity team and set expectations for our customers both Veterans and VA stakeholders alike. SLOs also help the Identity team manage the health of services and optimize decision-making for future innovations.

The Identity team has two customers: Veterans and VA stakeholders - as such there is two Service Level Objectives (SLOs) one for each customer.
