## Overview

The identity team asked the authenticated experience team to help them with research supporting the initiative to add non-veteran user roles to VA.gov. Our research aims to complete the following objectives:

1. Define all non-Veteran user roles for VHA, VBA, and NCA; identify the specific user types / roles, and what criteria a user needs to fit to qualify, according to each administration.
2. Translate administration-specific user roles into a VA-wide set of unified definitions, which encompasses all user types / roles.Identify use cases and outcomes for each of the non-Veteran user roles across VHA, VBA, and NCA.
3. (Stretch goal) Identify use cases and outcomes for each of the non-Veteran user roles across VHA, VBA, and NCA.


## Problem Statement

Currently, there is not a unified definition for each of the non-veteran customer types at the VA. Each administration — VHA, VBA, and NCA — has their own unique definitions and nuances, which increases the complexity of implementing non-veteran user roles on VA.gov. Delegates, beneficiaries, caregivers, and dependents are a few terms used interchangeably that encompass many different user types relying on many different products and services across VA.

## User Outcomes

### Desired outcomes

- This reseach continues to move us towards being able to support non-veteran customers on VA.gov.

### Undesired outcomes

- This research should **not** be directly translated  to functionality on VA.gov without first conducting additional research to verify our assumptions with user research. This would put us at risk for building something that's not actually helpful to our non-veteran customers.

## Business Outcomes

### Desired outcomes

We hope to accomplish the following with our research:

- All non-Veteran user roles for VHA, VBA and NCA are defined as specific user types/roles.
- We can define each administration's criteria for each user role.
- We have unified definitions across administrations for each user role that can guide how we might define different user types on VA.gov.

### Undesired outcomes

- We are unable to figure out broad categories for each user role that we can apply to VA.gov.

## Measuring Success

These are OKRs and KPIs for this research effort:

**Objective: Define all non-Veteran user roles for VHA, VBA, and NCA; identify the specific user types / roles, and what criteria a user needs to fit to qualify, according to each administration.**

- **Key result #1**: We have vetted a list of different user roles with each administration and received sign-off.

**Objective: Translate administration-specific user roles into a VA-wide set of unified definitions, which encompasses all user types / roles. Identify use cases and outcomes for each of the non-Veteran user roles across VHA, VBA, and NCA.**

- **Key result #1**: We have compiled a unified list of user roles that could be translated into user permissions on VA.gov.

**Objective: (Stretch goal) Identify use cases and outcomes for each of the non-Veteran user roles across VHA, VBA, and NCA.**

- **Key result #1**: We have started to compile a list of use cases and outcomes that can be used to support future research and definition.
