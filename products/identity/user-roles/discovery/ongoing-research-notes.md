## Questions

### Across VA (not specific to an administration)

- What qualifies a person as a dependent?
  - Does any VA administration recognize a partnership that is not a marriage?
  - How is a spouse different from other types of dependents?
  - When you're a child dependent, does your marital status affect your benefit eligibility? E.g. Fry scholarship says "You may still be eligible if you are married" in the [NCA legacy booklet](https://www.cem.va.gov/docs/factsheets/Planning_Legacy_Booklet.pdf).
- What qualifies someone as a beneficiary?
  - Does VA recognize domestic partnerships for benefits? If so, what are the qualifications? **Answer**: [see this page](https://www.va.gov/opa/marriage/)
- How are those roles different, and the same?
- Do you have to be a dependent to be a beneficiary?
- Learn more about POAs, CVSOs, VSOs, and claim agents. What is the difference between these 4 roles?
- Does VEO sit under VBA or VHA or NCA or none of those?

### VHA

- Do people who have TRICARE use MHV? Including non-Veterans?
- "Survivors" are eligible for TRICARE - what qualifies a person as a survivor? Legal relationship? Former spouses?
- What health tasks are on eBenefits?
- How does VHA view POAs? There's a difference between a health POA and a POA who can represent a veteran in court, for example.

### VBA

- Are VA Accredited Agents the same as "claims agents"?

#### eBenefits

- eBenefits - parents are handled differently according to [this doc](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/69833737d9fe22b8990bb987e7c50de13205c5d5/products/disability/declare-dependent/discovery/basic-product-evaluation.md#help-and-documentation----average). Learn more about that.
- Why are adopted children required to go through a manual review process when being added as a dependent?
- Is a Basic account useful to dependents and spouses?
- How does eBenefits know what type of user a person is (Veteran, spouse, dependent)?

### NCA

- Are there NCA related digital tools?
- This seems like it would be the most focused on non-Veterans, since the Veteran has passed when most of these benefits are used. True?
- Does NCA manage survivors pension benefits, and the Fry scholarship?
- How does adoption affect benefits for a surviving child: "If you were adopted out of the Veteran’s or service member’s family, but meet all other eligibility criteria, you still qualify for compensation."
