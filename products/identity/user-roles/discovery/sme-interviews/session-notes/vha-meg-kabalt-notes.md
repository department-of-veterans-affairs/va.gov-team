# Meg Kabalt, Senior Advisor for Families, Caregivers, and Survivors, SME Interview

11/3/2021

## Introduction

1. I know you're the senior advisor for families, caregivers and survivors. Can you tell me about your role? What does that mean?

   It's a brand new so she gets to make it up. She's a social worker by training and before the work she's doing now she had been at VACO for 8 years as the national director of the caregiver support program. So this is something that we saw come up for family caregiver who were managing all of the healthcare of the veteran (making appts, responding to secure messaging) so I have a lot of thoughts on how to make it work.

   Also worked on a project where they gave Caregivers iPads that was really the beginning of thinking about putting tools in the hands of family members to support the family members as they navigated VA.

   So this notion of there being things that are supportive of the caregiver specifically but having access to the veterans records, appts scheduling etc, those kind of things are two different sides of the coin

   Essentially in this role, I'm advising the Secretary, I'm paying attention to what's going on with families, VEO is doing al

2. How does your role relate to non-Veterans?

3. What are the different non-Veteran user types that your administration works with?

I'd like to understand the distinction between the three groups listed in your title.

## Caregivers

Caregivers vs families - for the purposes of this, I don't think it matters. Caregivers are taking care of services the Veterans can't do for themselves

- Caregivers could be a variety of people friends
  - The word caregiver is somewhat daunting people don't know what it is. a lot of people who need support don't like to admit that they need support, and their spouse may not want to admit that they have to support that veteran as well. 
  - There are legal definitions for caregivers in the caregiver program
  - When we talk about identity and having access to veteran appts, 
  - Caregivers may have their own medical record (collateral record with cerner); usually mental health care is being documented in their own VA medical record, if they are caregiver in the program
  - In additional, some caregivers are also Veterans
  - When we think about accessing VA stuff, there's really multiple things. One, we want individuals to be able to access their own stuff (e.g. caregiver accessing their own medical record)
  - Then we want to figure out a way that veterans can delegate to a family member or caregiver
- family is more expansive
- 

My understanding:

- A spouse, son, daughter, parent, stepfamily member, or extended family member of the Veteran, or 
  Someone who lives full-time with the Veteran, or is willing to do so if designated as a family caregiver
- Caregiver does not designate POA
- You don't have to have a legal relationship to be a caregiver

Is there more to it than that?

- The veteran has to be eligible for the program. You have to be service connected for injuries in order for your caregiver to qualify for the program

How about people who are self-identified caregivers, but don't participate in the VA Caregiver program? Any sense of what % of caregivers do fall into that bucket?

30,000 Veterans are participating in the CAP, but when we survey in the past, it's something like 2.7m report they need assistance from someone else.

What tasks would this person need to do?

- Anything a Veteran would need to do. We want them to be able to see all the notes the veteran can see, schedule appts, do secure messaging with providers
- One of the biggest issues is secure messaging, because veterans have mental health issues at a much higher rate than the general public, so we want caregivers to be able to email the provider without necessarily including the Veteran.
- There's also a safety piece here - we have a lot of, there could be violence in homes, and so we have to be careful about making sure that Caregivers can identify as themselves when they're communicating with a provider.
- It's also for the provider, the provider doesn't necessarily know who they're responding
- It's really important to have the delegated 
- Caregivers/family members assist with healthcare and ALL benefits, getting all the paperwork together, following along with the claim process, etc. there should also be some way to look at those services.

## Survivors

What tasks would this person need to do?

- They want to be looking at benefits decisions
- If they had been caring for the veteran before that veteran died, they would've already fallen into that family or caregiver category. The different for survivors is they become eligible for certain benefits once the veteran dies and they should be able to see the status of those benefits
- when Meg was saying people want to view benefit decisions after a veteran dies, does she mean their own benefits or the veteran? 
  - The survivors benefits.
  - Survivor is a legal term that refers to a person who's veteran's deaths is service connected injuries or illness
  - **Look into these definitions**
  - 
- They become beneficiaries themselves whereas families and caregivers are beneficiaries through the veteran.

## Dependent vs Beneficiary

- Beneficiary: someone who directly receives a service (payment, health care, whatever it may be) from VA
- What qualifies a person as a dependent?
  - Does VHA recognize a partnership that is not a marriage?
  - How is a spouse different from other types of dependents?
  - When you're a child dependent, does your marital status affect your benefit eligibility? E.g. Fry scholarship says "You may still be eligible if you are married" in the [NCA legacy booklet](https://www.cem.va.gov/docs/factsheets/Planning_Legacy_Booklet.pdf).
- What qualifies someone as a beneficiary?
- How are those roles different, and the same?
  - For example: a Veteran is a beneficiary and they receive compensation because they have dependents who are listed in VBA's system as dependents. They may receive additional money because they have dependents.
  - Dependents can sometimes receive mental health care - a veteran can get family treatments
    - 
  - A good distinction is that if the Veteran didn't exist, a beneficiary would still get services. (20 min mark)
  - On the caregiver side, the caregivers in the program are beneficiaries
- Do you have to be a dependent to be a beneficiary?

## Veteran Advocates

- What can you tell me about POAs, CVSOs, VSOs, and claim agents. 

  - There's a form that Veterans are allowed to sign that allows them to act on their behalf for benefits (comp+Pen) but not healthcare, or increasing their service connection
  - They should not be delegated access to health care

- What are the tasks that that person type may need to do?

  

## Business Line Priorities

From a VHA perspective, what do you think is the most important use case for non-Veterans?

- It's all of the medical pieces. Being able to access the veterans records, appointments, and secure messaging.
- The appt stuff and looking at records, that's easy to do as the veteran, but the secure messaging piece that in her mind is the most important one where it's clear to the provider and the caregiver that they're able to communicate as themselves.

## Next steps and Closing

Is there anyone else you think our team should talk to?

- There are member services offices in VBA and VHA, you should probably dig up those people. They're the ones who do the official, on the VHA side, member services actually makes decisions about things like does the caregiver get their own medical record or not, are they eligibnlefor that. Only certain individuals are eligible to receive beneficiary travel for example. There are so many different services available depending on all your different status, POW, MST, eligible things. Member services is the one that gets really the weeds about eligibility.
