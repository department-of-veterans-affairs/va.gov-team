# VBA OBI User Roles SME Interview Notes

11/5/2021

**I know your group is called the Office of Business Integration, but I have to confess I don't know what that means. Can you give me some background information about the work that you do?**

- We tend to act as liaisons between IT projects and business lines. We're also the data stewards for corporate data base and we work toward the integration of all of the other authoritative data bases that we integrate with the VA enterprise but also other government agencies as well. 

**What are some of the IT projects you've worked on that are related to non-Veterans?**

- IT projects related to non Veterans: 
  - worked on the mail automation project to automate the process of incoming mail with bots
  - Program managers for a project Role Based Processing System (RBPS), dependency claims, this is related to VA.gov somehow
  - OB in general does all the systems for the business lines, chg mgt for VRME, the new upgrade replacing the legacy system
  - Debacle that is the long term solution for education
  - We are the VBMS product owners
    - processing system using for Compensation, Pension and Fiduciary
  - We do regular business analyst things as well as data stewards things
- We've worked a lot with VA.gov for 
  - pension automation for introducing pension claims into RBPS, 
- Global communication preferences for all of VA

**How does your work relate to non-Veteran users?**

- We issue payments to:

  - Funeral homes. Comes to us directly for their burial reimbursement. They're a 3rd party coming to the VA for a benefit that belongs to the Vet

  - Attorneys. Attorney fee situation - if you hire a private attny to represent you in a VA claim, you agree to pay them 20%.

    **Is this a recurring or one time payment?**

    - Pretty sure it's one time based on their retro pay.  They don't have recurring payments
    - We wouldn't want them logging into VA.gov. These kinds of appeals from attorneys, they're no longer representing the Veteran. But the information we'd give to someone like that it'd be so minimal that there'd be nothing for them too see.
    - And with anything that goes to BVA, they'll call the call center and try to get the status of their claim and we send them to them
    - BVA is the "checks and balances", completely governed separately from NCA, VHA, VBA

- Fiduciaries - aren't beneficiaries but they assist the veterans with their funds. 

  - Checks are made out to the Veteran in care of the fiduciary.

- Nursing homes on behalf of a beneficiary

- Dealerships for auto purchase

- Loan guaranty is a totally different animal.

  -  The Veteran is usually the beneficiary for those, we don't have a lot of knowledge on how that process works

- Insurance line uses some of the big players like prudential

## Dependent vs Beneficiary

**Is there a difference between dependents and beneficiaries?**

- There can be a difference or they can be the same thing, depending on the type of benefit you're talking about.
- If you are a dependent typically you are a beneficiary 
- If you are a beneficiary you don't have to be a dependent
  - Example: If a Veteran has a running disability claim, they're eligible for dependents to be added to their award to increase the benefit, if they have a disability rating of 30% or higher.
  - But there are different types of beneficiary awards that could be issued to a dependent. 
    - Example: a veteran dies, and some dependents can file claims for certain types of benefits and become beneficiaries through the Veteran's service.
    - For example: Service connected disability death, spouse can apply for DIC and become a beneficiary themselves and receive that DIC benefit as a result of the veterans service connected death
- Dependents
  - Aren't always the beneficiary
  - Once a kid turns 18 and they go to college they get a check directly if they get benefits through DEA. They're still a dependent but they are getting their own benefit as well.

- What qualifies a person as a dependent?
  - They'll send me the link
  - We get more errors on dependency claims processing than anything else.

## Caregivers

How does your work intersect with Caregivers?

- Fiduciary program goes through this
- Fiduciary is the VBA equivalent 
- 

## Others

Any other non-Veteran groups within your work you're aware of that we haven't touched in?

- Power of Attorney 
  - Are VSOs and attorneys that are able to file claims on a Veterans behalf, check on the status of a claim, and we have a whole process for giving them access to the Veterans claim process. So if they're entitled to it.
  - D2D - VSO > VBA system. They have their own propriety software that talks to VA
  - Stakeholder Enterprise Portal

## Business Line Priorities

From a VBA OBI perspective, what do you think is the most important use case for non-Veterans?

- Spouses of dead veterans should have their on VA.gov log in after the Veteran is deceased
  - We get into a lot of a legal trouble to give a
  - Anyone who isn't a Veteran won't have their own file number.
  - Anyone who is there is connected TO A VETERAN through their own file number.
  - We're here to serve the Veteran, his widow, his dependents
- Dependent is now 18 and they're in receipt of their own award for DEA. 
  - They'd want to see their sub
  - We're not even going to let spouses who are claiming apportionment see that.
- We do have minor and adult children that receive death benefits
- May need to consider providing access to a fiduciary for a helpless child who is a recipient of benefit
- Even for spouses that can be a claims file.
- Beneficiaries who have their own awards and need to see information like that - payment history for non-Veteran 
- Parents DIC
