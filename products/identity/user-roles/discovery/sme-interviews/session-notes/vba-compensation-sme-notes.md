11/3/2021

## Dependent vs Beneficiary

- Is there a difference between dependents and beneficiaries?
  - Beneficiaries are individuals who are receive benefits. Person could be a Veteran, it could be a non-Veteran, spouse or dependent.
- What qualifies a person as a dependent?
  - A dependent is a person that is supported by the Veteran (could be mother, spouse, does not need to be tied to tax code)
    - We don't worry about tax purposes, but we do receive tax information on the pension and fiduciary side
  - Does VBA recognize a partnership that is not a marriage?
  - How is a spouse different from other types of dependents?
  - When you're a child dependent, does your marital status affect your benefit eligibility? E.g. Fry scholarship says "You may still be eligible if you are married" in the [NCA legacy booklet](https://www.cem.va.gov/docs/factsheets/Planning_Legacy_Booklet.pdf).
- What qualifies someone as a beneficiary?
  - Depends on the benefit, it's benefit specific. So you can be a compensation and disability
  - Hasn't seen a case in a while where individual do TORT claims.
- How are those roles different, and the same?
- Do you have to be a dependent to be a beneficiary?
- Apportionee would be a person that gets a piece of a Veterans monetary benefit. A veteran who means that they pay child support, they get a portion of the benefit.
  - An apportionment is associated with the primary beneficiaries record
  - The requirements that we worked on is just to allow them to access their benefit summary letter so they can provide income
  - Need to be careful about showing Veteran information
- They do not use delegates.
- Primary beneficiaries get the live benefit
  - Beneficiary where the award of beneficiary originated from
  - Loan guarantee, where the beneficiary could be the spouse

## Veteran Advocates

- What can you tell me about your work with POAs, CVSOs, VSOs, and claim agents?
  - Mentions SEP
  - A beneficiary could get a fiduciary assigned by VA but they'd have to be a primary fiduciary
  - And there for the fiduciary becomes the primary means of communication and information for the beneficiary
    - They're kind of a legal guardian for the beneficiary
    - Fiduciary don't have any outside access at this time
    - They do have something on the pension and fiduciary side for fiducaries
      - They have been putting in a lot of automation
    - This group is just compensation
- What are the tasks that that person type may need to do?

## Caregivers

How does compensation and pension intersect with Caregivers?

- VA does not recognize anybody outside of them assigned them
- I don't believe so.

## Others

Any other non-Veteran groups within your work you're aware of that we haven't touched in?

- Not in our group, but over in NCA they do have where they allow funeral homes have access to a system that they benefits out to those individuals, but that's not something that we do.

- Ginger Wilson is their counterpart on the NCA side
- Bill Barnes

Compensation:

- For a live Veteran, outside of a 
- 

## Business Line Priorities

From a VBA compensation perspective, what do you think is the most important use case for non-Veterans?

- Chapter 35 would be the biggest one, so if the Veteran is 100% and he has chapter 35 benefits
  - This is kind of a crossover benefit
  - It starts out in compensation and ends up in education
  - When the Veteran is permanently and total disabled, they're granted chapter 35 benefits which means spouse and child are eligible for education
  - Pension is based solely on non-compensation recipients, also an income based program, subtracted by any medical expense they have.
- Incompentancy would fall under pension and fiduciary
- Attorneys, not necessarily VSOs

## Next steps and Closing

Is there anyone else you think our team should talk to?

- Make sure they have a fiduciary person on who can elaborate on how they assign a fiduciary to a veteran
  - Fiduciaries take care of the compensation side of Veterans
  - Fiduciary hub are the ones who manage all of that.
