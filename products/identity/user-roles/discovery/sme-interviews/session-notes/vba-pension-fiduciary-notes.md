# Conversation Guide for SME Interviews, VBA Pension + Fiduciary

11/5/2021

## Introduction

I know your group works with pension and fiduciaries, but I don't know much beyond that. Can you give me some background information about the work that you do?

- We function as the overarching business line that services all the benefits and the processes surrounding veteran's pension, survivors pension, survivors DIC. We're also responsible for burial related benefits which can come from a myriad of claimants, whether it's relatives of the deceased veteran or a 3rd party organization or even a friend that is associated to the burial costs of the deceased veteran.
  - Cemetery administration oversees and is responsible for national cemetery burials. But eligible veterans can also have the cost associated and reimbursed for private burial locations as well. So that's the part of those overall benefits that we're responsible for. And the separation of NCA from Pension and fiduciaries
  - 3rd party organizations: state veteran cemeteries associated with burial at state burial, funeral homes can be a claimant and be reimbursed for the cost they incur for services they provide.
- We also are involved in the related systems that process those benefit payments. As well as the procedural and legislative process that's associated with the delivery of those benefits as well.
- That's how we, compensation and that benefit process, that's how pension and fiduciaries function and stands within the overall organization benefit organizer. 

## Dependent vs Beneficiary

- Is there a difference between dependents and beneficiaries?
  - A dependent would be, say a Veteran or surviving spouse award. The dependent would be most likely a dependent child or spouse. They wouldn't be the beneficiary. The beneficiary would be whoever's primary award it would be. If the Veteran is alive the Veteran would be the beneficiary. The dependent would not actually be the sole beneficiary unless there is some sort of apportionment 
- What qualifies a person as a dependent?
  - Legal spouse, any minor children until 18, but there could also be an adult child as long as they're enrolled in school until age 23, helpless children (have to go through the rating process), and there would also be a dependent parent as a dependent on an award, and step-children.
- What qualifies someone as a beneficiary?
  - For pension, they'd have to have qualifying wartime service (Veteran criteria).
  - For deceased Veterans, DIC, is based on service that the deceased Veteran and their disabilities incurred during their life, the association to their cause of death will determine that particular benefit.
  - DIC wouldn't be any sort of income based unless it's parents DIC.

## Fiduciaries and Veteran Advocates

I'd like to learn more about fiduciaries.  

- Its kind of weird, we're termed Pension and fiduciary but fiduciary is more of a function of the process that, it doesn't just solely function on pension. It also services compensation records. As fiduciary and fiduciary hub locations, they're responsible for assigning the work that goes around with appointing a fiduciary for an incompetent veteran. And that's associated with the rating process, and how a beneficiary is determined to be incompetent to handle financial affairs.
  - Veteran may have someone already maintaining their funds and request that that person or 3rd party organization be the fiduciary.
  - Still has to go through the process where the VA reviews the designated payee and organization. It's a whole separate process with how they maintain status and every so often we have to go the Veteran's location to monitor and review their status with the fiduciary (field examination process)
  - Fiduciary, if you know about kind of how awards and compensation and pension awards are generated, fiduciary has it's own separate process that they do to 
  - This is definitely a separate fiduciary process from delegate process.
- There's a whole separate process with the appointment and maintaining of a VA approved fiduciary.

How does a Veteran get a fiduciaries?

- Is it something assigned by the VA?
  - Once they're assigned to the VA they can access certain systems on behalf of the veteran.
  - They can obtain and use that access to review and maintain the Veteran awards.
- How are the fiduciaries accessing Veteran records?
  - Not sure specifically.  Maybe a request that they do. They're able to apply for access to VBMS, and once provided access even submit claims and respond to VA correspondence. 
- Do they automatically get delegate access?
  - No
- Are there any fiduciaries specific systems or processes we should be aware of as it relates to non-Veteran user roles?
  - Fiduciary hubs are a physical location. If you're familiar with the regional offices where VA benefits are maintained. Fiduciary hubs are a sub department at a regional office across the country (there are 8) and those particular locations maintain all the fiduciary related activities that it's assigned to.
  - Right now, the way VA work is assigned, its dispersed based on capacity to various locations or fiduciary hubs or pension management center.

## Others

Any other non-Veteran groups within your work you're aware of that we haven't touched in?

- Parents
- Children
  - Surviving children for DIC if there is no surviving spouse
- Spouses
- Fiduciary
- Funeral homes and State cemeteries
  - They won't be using VA.gov in the same fashion as a consistent beneficiary because they're one time payments
  - Could use it for submission of their claim for reimbursement

## Business Line Priorities

From a VBA pension and fiduciary perspective, what do you think is the most important use case for non-Veterans?

- Survivors pension and DIC

- We already have burial claims electronically being submitted, through eBenefits

  

## Next steps and Closing

Is there anyone else you think our team should talk to?

- We didn't have, the fiduciary by all means I know I work on pension and fiduciary but there may be an aspect related to that that maybe more in tuned with that being also one of the priorities too. 
- We recently expanded a lot of fiduciaries with VBMS FID as a subsystem of VBMS but there may be some opportunities I think to maybe also incorporate something with that along with you know
  - Isreal Hendricks worked on a lot of the ins and outs of VBMS Fid and also Dameon Cox they might be able to provide more directed information or ideas in terms of how that could possibly fit in right along with the initial priorities.
