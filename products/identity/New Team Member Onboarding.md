# Welcome
Welcome to the VSP Identity Team.  We're excited to have you here!  Please take the time to make a copy of this document to your personal GitHub so that

## What is Identity?
The Identity team at VSP is responsible for many aspects of how we handle users within the VA.gov ecosystem.  This includes the [Unified Sign-in Page](https://www.va.gov/?next=loginModal), our upcoming Sign-in Service, Inherited Proofing (migrating users from legacy to modern CSP's), and much more.
