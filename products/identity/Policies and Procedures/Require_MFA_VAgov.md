## Background

Fraudulent Direct Deposit account changes on VA.gov are on the rise at the Department of Veterans Affairs. In an attempt to reduce fraudulent activity on VA.gov, the VA.gov Identity team has implemented a policy that requires all direct deposit changes to be made with a verified ID.me or Login.gov account that requires MFA (multi-factor authentication). This policy was set by the Identity team's PO (Product Owner) at the time, Cody Reinold. This policy was implemented in Sept 2021 on VA.gov. MFA was enabled on VA.gov with the adoption of IDme on VA.gov in 2016. The policy has been set and is not set to expire.


## Policy

All bank account (direct deposit) detail modifications within the VA.gov domain must utilize a verified ID.me or Login.gov account with required multi-factor authentication. Services which provide the option to modify bank account details must also confirm multi-factor was successfully entered by the current user during the session in which the account changes are being requested. Modifications on a bank account must be performed by a user that is directly authenticated, modifications cannot be made on behalf of another user.

## Execution

Services within VA.gov must validate the current users details from the `user model`. The fields from the `user model` which must be present at the time the modifications are being requested are:

```elixir
data.attributes.profile.multifactor=true AND 
data.attributes.profile.loa.current=3 AND
data.attributes.profile.signIn.serviceName=(logingov OR idme)
```
For backend (vets-api) only services they must conform to the following attributes:
```ruby
user.multifactor = true AND
user.loa3? = true AND
user.sign_in.service_name = ( 'logingov' OR 'idme')
```

If these conditions are not met then the service must not allow for the submission or request to be forwarded to the downstream service which consumes the bank account changes.

In order to ensure continued access to modify bank account details, users who do not currently meet the requirements: 

1.) a verified ID.me or Login.gov account `AND`

2.) multi-factor authentication enabled, must be shown content that explains why their current account does not meet the requirements of VA. 

The service must also provide the user with a path to meet the VAâ€™s requirements by creating a verified account with [ID.me](http://id.me/) or [Login.gov](http://login.gov/) accounts AND setting up the verified account with multi-factor authentication.

## Renewal Instructions

This policy is not set to expire however it will be reviewed yearly to ensure the technical details of the values to validate are still accurate. Reviews will be conducted yearly in the month of May.
