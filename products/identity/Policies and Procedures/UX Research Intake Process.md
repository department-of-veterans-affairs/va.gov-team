# Identity Team UX Research Intake Process

1. A new finding or – more likely –  a series of findings are created by the UX team. The findings will have some kind of research or documentation behind them.  
2. The UX team presents their findings to other members of the Identity Team  leading to a discussion of the feasibility of turning the findings into tasks.  There might be several tasks coming from a single finding. For each task, we should be able to answer the following questions:
   - Why is this important?	
   - What is the data behind it?
   - How will it benefit our customers?
3. Those tasks will be examined in terms of impact and level of effort by members of the Identity team – the PM(s), plus team members who made the initial findings, as well as engineering – each task will be prioritized into one of three true outcomes:
   - The task will be worked on as soon as resources are available.  
     - Either a new Epic is created or – more likely – the task added to an existing Epic.
   - The task will be worked on in the future.
     - Foundation of a future Product Brief or added to an existing Epic.
     - Prioritized with the Product Owners.
   - The task is fully deprioritized, and will never be worked upon.
  
## SIPOC Chart
**Goal: Intake New Work from UX**

| Supplier  | Inputs     | Process | Outputs | Customers | 
| :------------- |:------------- | :----- | :----- |  :----- |
| UX Team | UX Research Findings   | UX creates findings doc | Feedback  | Veterans | 
|  | Team Meetings  | Team discusses findings | Tasks  | VA.gov Product Teams | 
|  |  | Tasks are created | Prioritizations |  | 
|  |  | Tasks are prioritized |  |  | 
  
## Expectations
- **Feedback:** each crew lead and product managers will provide feedback either verbally or in written form for each of the recommendations and findings (where a recommendation is not formulated) provided by the UX research.

- **Prioritizations:** Product Managers will document the research recommendations with the output feedback within the appropriate product folders inside github. Links to the research will be referenced within the feedback documents. Product Managers will work with the VA.gov Product Owners to determine prioritization.

- **Tasks:** Product Managers will create the appropriate user stories for each of the agreed upon planned work items. These user stories will remain in the product brief as “future work” until it’s ready to be worked on and documented within an epic. For the sake of keeping our boards clean, work should not be added until as a user story, it should only be added once the work has been refined and approved by all necessary parties.

## Notes
- Not all research findings require a robust review and approval process. For example, bugs that are discovered with current products that the engineers determine can be fixed without major changes, would be completed as soon as engineers are available. 
- Bugs should still go through the PMs and crew leads, however they should be expedited to ensure we minimize the impact of the newly discovered bug.
- Not all findings require work to be done, however they all require a response as to why the work will not be completed.
