# Standup

## Problem:

Standups currently do not provide engineers and leadership with enough information to properly track progress of major initiatives and understand the roadblocks of our team.

## Proposed solution:

- Mondays: Walk the board. Someone will share the zenhub board on zoom, and go through each ticket starting from the “Review” column.
    - We will start by filtering the entire board by the label “Identity-UX”. This will ensure we move through the UX tickets first, then allowing those individuals to move over to other work once the engineering tickets are discussed. We do this because there are more engineering tickets and conversations will likely occur that do not have much of an impact on the day to day operations of UX. However, UX individuals are encouraged to stay in stand up if they are available.
    - Remove the “Identity-UX” filter and go through the rest of the board starting from the “Review” column and working all the way through the “in progress” column.
    - Document roadblocks
        - What the roadblock is
        - What is it impacting
        - Who owns the action/follow up
- Tuesday - Thursday:
    - Five people will share their screen and talk directly to the work they are currently on.
        - These folks will be scheduled and known before.
        - The schedule will be the same every week.
        - Each person can trade timeslots if they are going to be OOO during standup one day.
        - Try to keep it to no more than 4 minutes each
    - Each person will talk to the following questions:
        - Why are you doing this work, what major initiative is this part of
        - What were you able to complete yesterday, what are you working on today
        - Did anything interrupt you, such as a big fix, outage, etc.
        - Any roadblocks, concerns, risks
- Friday:
    - Friday we block an hour to hold a forum in place of standup where we talk about spike results and anything we need to workshop. If during the call we determine we need more time on the topic we can pull them to the “parking lot”.
        - This should be an informal meeting. Bring lunch/breakfast, hangout style
        - If you can’t make it no problem, but try to rely on this session to workshop ideas with folks to determine if another more focused session is needed
