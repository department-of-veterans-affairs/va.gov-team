### **Incident Response Playbook for VA.gov**

#### **1\. Purpose**

This playbook outlines the structured approach to managing incidents affecting VA.gov Identity services, ensuring minimal disruption and rapid recovery while maintaining compliance with service level agreements (SLAs).

---

#### **2\. Incident Severity Levels**

Severity levels guide the prioritization and response efforts:

* **Sev-1 (Critical):** Total authentication outage affecting all users (e.g., all credentials are down).  
* **Sev-2 (High):** Major outage with significant authentication failures (e.g., a single credential is down).  
* **Sev-3 (Moderate):** Limited user impact due to dependency issues (e.g., subset users reliant on a down system).  
* **Sev-4 (Low):** Intermittent issues causing performance degradation (e.g., retries or latency).  
* **Sev-5 (Minimal):** Expected maintenance or low-impact intermittent issues.

---

#### **3\. Roles and Responsibilities**

* Incident Commander (IC): Leads the response effort.  
* Technical Lead: Coordinates technical investigation and remediation efforts.  
* On-Call Responder: Acts as the initial point of contact.  
* Security Analyst: Investigates security-related aspects of the incident (e.g., PII exposure, unauthorized access).  
* Platform Support Coordinator: Collaborates with external support teams (e.g., VA.gov platform staff).  
* Stakeholder Liaison: Communicates with non-technical stakeholders (e.g., VA leadership, external partners).

#### **4\. Incident Lifecycle**

* **Detection & Reporting**  
  * Incidents are identified via monitoring tools (e.g., PagerDuty, Datadog) or reported by users.  
  * Alert triggers match predefined SLA-based severity levels.  
* **Triage**  
  * Confirm and classify the incident based on impact and severity.  
  * Notify the appropriate responder(s).  
* **Response & Escalation**  
  * IC establishes a response bridge and coordinates with SMEs.  
  * If required, escalate to relevant VA departments or external vendors (e.g., ID.me, Login.gov, IAM).  
* **Resolution**  
  * Implement mitigation steps or workarounds.  
  * Monitor systems for stability before declaring resolution.  
* **Post-Incident**  
  * Conduct a post-mortem to document root cause, timeline, and actions taken.  
  * Implement changes to prevent recurrence.

---

#### **5\. Communication Protocols**

* Regular updates via predefined channels (e.g., Slack, PagerDuty notifications).  
* Stakeholder-specific communication for leadership, end-users, and cross-org teams.  
* Final incident report shared post-resolution.

---

#### **6\. Tools**

* **PagerDuty:** Incident alerts, tracking, and MTTA analysis.  
* **Datadog:** Monitoring and real-time metrics, incident declaration and tracking, post mortem generation

---

#### **7\. Metrics & Reporting**

* Measure **Mean Time to Acknowledge (MTTA)** and **Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR)**.  
* Generate monthly compliance reports for SLAs.  
* Conduct yearly tabletop exercises to evaluate readiness and refine processes.
