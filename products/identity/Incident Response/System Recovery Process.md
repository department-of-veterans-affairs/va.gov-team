#System Recovery Process
This is where the documentation for System Recovery Process for Incident Response is going to live.

### Definition
The exact steps taken to restore authentication on va.gov if everything were completely deleted at the infrastructure level. This can be a multi-scenario document but the first one simply needs to account for pods destroyed/compromised
- How will we address and fix/remediate the issue/issues

### What Platform Does
Incident Recovery Process: Determine the root cause
- The incident commander should create a document to capture notes, discussions, and other items (screenshots, log messages, etc.) that can act as a part of the record of the incident for later reporting to stakeholders, and to assist the team when a retrospective is conducted.
- Don’t be afraid to enlist help from Platform support and/or OCTO engineering points of contact.
- External: For P1 incidents: work with your OCTO point of contact to ensure that the Major Incident Management process has been triggered. In general, communicate with the service owners and work together to ensure that the root cause is addressed or has a plausible plan & timeline to be addressed.
- Internal: Create a support request with category “http://VA.gov incident” in #vfs-platform-support – trigger Pagerduty if necessary.
