On Thursday, May 16, 2024, the Identity Team held a refinement for Incident Repsonse. Here's what we came up with.

## Definition of Incident Response
What steps will we take to respond and remediate outages to our services.

### Directly Responsible
- Unified Sign-in Page (USiP)
- Single Sign-On External (SSOe)
- Sign-in Service (SiS)
- Terms of Use (ToU)

### Indirectly Responsibile (to a point)
- Credential Service Providers (CSP)
- Master Person Index (MPI)

### Out of Scope
- Status IO Page

## Problem Statement
We currently do not have an end-to-end methodology for defining, tracking, communicating and resolving incidents. In order to better serve Veterans and other VA.gov, we need to implement and communicate a formalized Incident Response process which includes the following:
- Incident Management System
- Outage Communication
- System Recovery Process
- Internal Reporting on Incidents

### Visions
- Minimize manual communication of degraded service so I as an engineer can focus on resolving the issue.
- I never want our consumers or users to wonder if we know about an issue they are currently seeing

## Considerations
- ATO Requirement: steps to recover service.
- All the the datadog alerts have links to old response docs, need to be updated.
- Document where our lines of resposibilites begin and end.
- How might we prioritize/triage alerts based on severity?
- Revisit levels of response within our current off hour alerts (in datadog).
- List out sources of incident reporting and what the response will be.

## Current Reporting Process/Solutions/Documentation
### Summary of Current State & Recommendations
- [Authentication Status Internal Communication for VA Teams](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Research/2024-03%20Service%20Level%20Objectives/Content-research-internal-teams.md)
- [Content Research for Veterans](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Research/2024-03%20Service%20Level%20Objectives/Content%20research%20for%20Veterans.md)
### Urgent Request Definition & Process
- [Meet with the Identity Team](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Support%20Process/identity-office-hours.md#-on-call-support)
### What Platform Does
- [Incident Response Documentation for Application Teams](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/incident-response-documentation-for-application-te)
### Identity Processes Previously Established
- [SSOe Outage on VA.gov](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Policies%20and%20Procedures/SSOe_Outage_Response.md)
- [Update Monitors Alerts Datadog](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Troubleshooting_logging/Monitoring%20and%20Alerting/Monitors_Alerts_Datadog.md) (very old, should be deleted after mined for use)

## Incident Management System
### Definition
A tool which allows for the centralized location of in progress and closed incident information.
- Identity can review, assign, prioritize and track tickets through their lifecycle.

### Things to solve
- Who is triaging incoming issues?
- Who creates & assigns initial tickets?

## Outage Communication
### Definition
Information about an incident -- planned outages out of scope --is posted to:
- VA.gov sign-in page
- Public Identity slack channel
- Email distro for internal customers not on slack

### Guidelines
- Communication should make sense: not overwhelming, but not Pony Express, either.
- Externally if Vets logging in need to know
- Internally to the team (to assign, metrics, tracking)
- Timely notification
- Clear and concise messaging
- Regular updates
- Estimated time to resolution

### Things to solve
- How do we navigate incident comms when fault is not ours but depends on other agency’s response?
- How is blame approached during unknowns?
- Or when both Identity and other are responsible?

### What Platform Does
- Veterans
  - Use appropriate tooling and communication channels to ensure Veterans are aware of the issue as necessary and do not spend time doing work that will be lost. This may include:
    - Adding a downtime notification
    - Disabling a given app or feature
    - Direct communications such as emails, other alerting, etc.
- Stakeholders
  - Ensure that your VA points of contact are informed and aware of the issue, its impact and expected resolution timeline. Please include a link to issues and/or slack conversations so that they may keep up to date on progress.
 
### Current Comms
**Internal**
- Slack Alerts

## System Recovery Process
### Definition
The exact steps taken to restore authentication on va.gov if everything were completely deleted at the infrastructure level. This can be a multi-scenario document but the first one simply needs to account for pods destroyed/compromised
- How will we address and fix/remediate the issue/issues

### What Platform Does
Incident Recovery Process: Determine the root cause
- The incident commander should create a document to capture notes, discussions, and other items (screenshots, log messages, etc.) that can act as a part of the record of the incident for later reporting to stakeholders, and to assist the team when a retrospective is conducted.
- Don’t be afraid to enlist help from Platform support and/or OCTO engineering points of contact.
- External: For P1 incidents: work with your OCTO point of contact to ensure that the Major Incident Management process has been triggered. In general, communicate with the service owners and work together to ensure that the root cause is addressed or has a plausible plan & timeline to be addressed.
- Internal: Create a support request with category “http://VA.gov incident” in #vfs-platform-support – trigger Pagerduty if necessary.

## Internal Reporting on Incidents
### Definition
Post-mortems and communications to our internal customers about the incident.

### Things to solve
- How do we improve our processes based upon the incident?
- How do we track the work that comes from the incident?
- How do we establish a process that balances accountability with agency/ ability / autonomy/ empowerment to respond?
- What metrics/measurements do we need to know about this incident in the grander scheme of our incidences? (patterns)
