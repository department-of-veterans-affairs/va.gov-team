# Outage Communication
This is where documentation of our Incident Response Outage Communication strategy will live.

### Definition
Information about an incident -- planned outages out of scope --is posted to:
- VA.gov sign-in page
- Public Identity slack channel
- Email distro for internal customers not on slack

### Guidelines
- Communication should make sense: not overwhelming, but not Pony Express, either.
- Externally if Vets logging in need to know
- Internally to the team (to assign, metrics, tracking)
- Timely notification
- Clear and concise messaging
- Regular updates
- Estimated time to resolution

UX did some research surrounding this, which can be found here:
- [Authentication Status Internal Communication for VA Teams](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Research/2024-03%20Service%20Level%20Objectives/Content-research-internal-teams.md)
- [Content Research for Veterans](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Research/2024-03%20Service%20Level%20Objectives/Content%20research%20for%20Veterans.md)

### Things to solve
- How do we navigate incident comms when fault is not ours but depends on other agency’s response?
- How is blame approached during unknowns?
- Or when both Identity and other are responsible?

### What Platform Does
(Note: for reference only.
- Veterans
  - Use appropriate tooling and communication channels to ensure Veterans are aware of the issue as necessary and do not spend time doing work that will be lost. This may include:
    - Adding a downtime notification
    - Disabling a given app or feature
    - Direct communications such as emails, other alerting, etc.
- Stakeholders
  - Ensure that your VA points of contact are informed and aware of the issue, its impact and expected resolution timeline. Please include a link to issues and/or slack conversations so that they may keep up to date on progress.
 
### Current Comms
