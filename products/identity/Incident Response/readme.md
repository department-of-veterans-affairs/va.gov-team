# Incident Response 

## Overview: 
Now that we have created our [Service Level Objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Products/Login%20SLO/SLIs_and_SLOs.md) and published our [Service Level Agreements](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/SLA/identity_SLA_template.md), it is time to create procedures surrounding what happens when incidents arise relating to those objectives and/or agreements. 

This is part of the book of work that maps to _O1-KR2: VA.gov authentication SLOs are developed._

Think of it as the thrilling conclusion of the trilogy that started with the SLO proect, and left us on a cliffhanger at the conclusion of the SLA project!


## Problem Statement: 
We currently do not have an end-to-end methodology for defining, tracking, communicating and resolving incidents that are related to our Service Level Agreements. In order to better serve Veterans and other VA.gov teams, we need to implement and communicate a formalized Incident Response process which includes the following:
* Incident Management process
* Outage Communication strategies for Veterans and other VA.gov teams.
* System recovery plan.
* Internal reporting on incidents.

## What's In Scope: 
### These deliverables:
* [Incident Management Process](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Incident%20Response/Incident%20Management%20System.md)
* [Outage Communication](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Incident%20Response/Outage%20Communication.md)
  * Internal
  * External (when applicable)
* [System Recovery Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Incident%20Response/System%20Recovery%20Process.md)
* [Internal Reporting on Incidents](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Incident%20Response/Internal%20Reporting.md)

### For these areas of responsibility:
**Directly Responsible**
- Unified Sign-in Page (USiP)
- Single Sign-On External (SSOe)
- Sign-in Service (SiS)
- Terms of Use (ToU)

**Indirectly Responsible (to a point)**
- Credential Service Providers (CSP)
- Master Person Index (MPI)

  
## Out of Scope: (for this iteration)
* Status Page
* Planned Outage Communications

## High-Level Use Cases:
* As a VA.gov team member, I would like the Identity team to create a process for incident response & management, so that I may know what to expect when there are service outages.
* As a VA.gov user, I would like to see notifications which tell me there is a current issue with logging into VA.gov, so I understand why I cannot currently login.
* As a VA.gov team member, I would like the Identity Team to notify me if there is a sign-in issue, so that I make take the proper actions at my end to help facilitate a solution.
* As a VA.gov team member, I would like the Identity Team to create a System Recovery Plan so that I understand their steps for system recovery.
* As a VA.gov team member, I would like the Identity Team to create a process for reporting on Incidents to other internal teams, so I might understand root causes of incidents, resolutions of incidents and how to prevent future incidents.


## Assumptions:
- We build upon what we we put in the [SLA Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/SLA/identity_SLA_template.md) for the definition of Incident.
- We update the current Datadog alert links, which are currently broken.
- We determine and document where our lines of responsibilites begin and end.
- We automate as much of the communication as is possible.
- The System Recovery piece will help fulfill our ATO responsibilities (two for the price of one!)
- We come up with a prioritization / triage process for alerts based upon severity. (Possibly starting with that SLA doc.)
- We revisit our levels of response within our current off-hour alerts (in datadog).
- We come with with a list of sources of incident reporting and what the response will be. (Or maybe a table?)



## Solution Approach: 
In order to track each Deliverable by each Area of Responsibility, we've created this table:

| Deliverable →   Area  ↓   | Incident Management Process     | Outage Comms (Internal) | Outage Comms (External) | System Recovery | Internal Reporting | 
| :------------- |:------------- | :----- | :----- |  :----- |  :----- |
| **USiP** | | | | | |
| **SSOe** | | | | | |
| **SiS** | | | | | |
| **ToU**| | | | | |
| **Login.gov** | | | | | |
| **ID.Me** | | | | | |
| **MHV**| | | | | |
| **DS Logon** | | | | | |
| **MPI** | | | | | |

The early thinking is that each field will contain a link to where our documentation for that solution exists. It may not be be that every single field will be filled out, but if a field doesn't need to be filled out, as simple "n/a" will suffice.
  
## Technical Considerations:
| Issue         | Notes         | 
| :------------- |:-------------| 
| Update the downtime banners to fire based on authentication method, either SiS or SSOe. Today the banner shows if the SSOe service is down even if a user is trying to login with SiS (oauth=true param set)| We need to add a PD integration within PD, we need to figure out how to handle backend statuses, potentially need to update the frontend banner settings, need to update the datadog monitor for SiS              |

## UX/ Design Considerations:
| Issue         | Notes         | 
| ------------- |:------------- | 
| Language & placements for outage messages for Vets |  Review current outage messages   |

## Measuring Success:
| KPI           | Notes         | 
| ------------- |:------------- | 
| MTTA (Mean Time To Acknolwedge |  [MTTA Monthly Review Procedure](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/SLA/Reports/MTTA_Instructions.md)             |
| Time to Remediate | Will need to figure out how to properly measure this |
