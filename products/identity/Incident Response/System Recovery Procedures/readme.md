## Overview
The system recovery plan includes steps needed to restore critical OCTO Identity services on VA.gov. This includes technical requirements, contacts, and action steps for each application or service. 

Thereâ€™s also an [exercise template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Incident%20Response/System%20Recovery%20Procedures/System%20Recovery%20Plan%20Exercise%20Template.md) to guide team members through the process. After completing the system recovery plan, team members [complete a retro](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/master/teams/vsp/teams/Identity/Documentation/Internal_Process/retro_template.md) to document what happened and what we learned.
