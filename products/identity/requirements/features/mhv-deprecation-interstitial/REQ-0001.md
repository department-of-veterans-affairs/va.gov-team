# REQ-0001: Show interstitial after login for MHV-only users

**Description**  
Display an interstitial immediately after authentication for users who have **only** MHV credentials, guiding them to upgrade to a modern sign-in method.

**Requirement Details**  
- The system MUST detect when a user logs in using MHV credentials and does not have a ID.me or Login.gov credential.  
- The interstitial MUST appear immediately after authentication, but before redirecting to the intended VA.gov page.  
- The interstitial MUST include a CTA that links to both modern credential sign in flows.
