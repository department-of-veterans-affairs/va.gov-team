## Background
The purpose of this document is to document what the banner looks like during authentication-related unexpected downtime events and/or maintenance windows. These downtime banners will display in the Sign-in Modal and Unified Sign-in Page.

We determine downtime statuses by making an API request to `/v0/backend_statuses`
- Unexpected downtime `statuses` array
- Maintenance banners `maintenance_windows` array
