## Background
The purpose of this document is to document what the banner looks like during authentication-related unexpected downtime events and/or maintenance windows. These downtime banners will display in the Sign-in Modal and Unified Sign-in Page.

We determine downtime statuses by making an API request to `/v0/backend_statuses`
- Unexpected downtime `statuses` array
- Maintenance banners `maintenance_windows` array

### Authentication dependencies
- Master Person Index (MPI)
- SSOe (IAM)
- CSPs
    - ID.me
    - Login.gov
    - DS Logon (deprecated after Oct 1 2025)

## Technical user flow
1. User navigates to VA.gov > Clicks "Sign in" to open the sign-in modal
2. A request is made to the `GET /v0/backend_statuses` (fed from PagerDuty and upcoming maintenance windows)
3. The response from `GET /v0/backend_statuses` is parsed and read
    1. The `statuses` array is checked to see if any of the authentication dependencies have a status other than `active`
        1. If dependency status is `active` - do nothing
        2. If dependency status is something other than `active` - lookup which dependency and display content associated with that dependency
        3. If multiple dependencies are something other than `active` - display the multiple services down content
    2. The `maintenance_windows` array is checked to see if any of the authentication dependencies have a maintenance window 1 hour prior
        1. If maintenance window does not exist - do nothing
        2. If maintenance window does exist and is within 1 hour prior to starting window, display the maintenance banner
  
## Thresholds
> Note: StatsD (vets-api) => DataDog => PagerDuty => `GET /v0/backend_statuses` API route => VA.gov (sign-in modal)

Thresholds are determined in [Datadog](https://vagov.ddog-gov.com/notebook/17903/downtime-banner?view=view-mode) and are connected to PagerDuty.

| Authentication dependency | Threshold | DataDog monitor | 
| --- | --- | --- |

| Master Person Index (MPI) | MPI latency is above 5 seconds for 15 minutes | [URL](https://vagov.ddog-gov.com/monitors/238295) | 
| SSOe (IAM) | SSOe StatsD logs (success, failure, attempts) are below 30 logs for the past 30 minutes | [URL](https://vagov.ddog-gov.com/monitors/89113) | 
| SSOe (IAM) | SSOe latency (p95) is above 5 seconds for the past 5 minutes | [URL](https://vagov.ddog-gov.com/monitors/200801) | 
| ID.me | Authentication success rate is <45% in the past 30 minutes | [URL](https://vagov.ddog-gov.com/monitors/119914) |
