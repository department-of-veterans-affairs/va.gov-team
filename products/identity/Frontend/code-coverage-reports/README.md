# Identity Frontend Code Coverage Report

## Generating the Monthly Code Coverage Report
1. From your terminal nagivate to ```vets-website``` directory on your local machine
2. For each Identity-owned directory, generate a coverage report (See table below for test commands)
   > Note: Ensure you add the ```--coverage --coverage-html``` flag when running unit tests in the platform directory
4. Wait for unit tests to finish and ensure all tests are passing for the given application/directory
5. Open coverage ```index.html``` in browser to view report.
   - Use the ```cd coverage``` terminal command to navigate to ```vets-website/coverage``` directory
   - Open file in browser using ```open index.html``` terminal command
6. Take a screenshot of the code coverage report for each Identity-owned application and directory
   > Note: Do not screenshot this for the `platform/user/authentication/tests` as the displayed numbers are shared with CoP and incorrect
7. Create a new monthly report file in the [code coverage reports](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Frontend/code-coverage-reports) directory using the following naming convention: `{year}-{month}.md` (see [December 2024 code coverage report](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Frontend/code-coverage-reports/2024-12.md) as an example)
   - Add the title: **Code coverage report (Month Year)**
   - Add 3 sections
      - **Combined**
      - **Applications**
      - **Platform**
   - In the Applications section
      - Create a table with the file path & test command and a screenshot of the code coverage report for that application
      - Continue until there are no other applications left (there should only be 5 rows, 5 screenshots)
   - In the Platforms section
      - Create a table with the file path & test command and a screenshot of the code coverage report for that directory
      - Continue until there are no other applications left (there should only be 6 rows, 5 screenshots)
   - In the Combined section
      - Create a table with the Statements, Branches, Functions, and Lines as column headers and create Percent and Raw as row headers
      - Get the sum of the covered number and the total number as well as the percent for each of the column headers
      - Input the data into table and sent it to Joe N.
