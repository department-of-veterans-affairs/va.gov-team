# Identity
Welcome to the Identity folder. This directory contains information about user identity on Va.gov. You'll find documentation on things like login, personalization, profile, and more.

## What we're doing:

### Current Team Objectives


**Sign-in Service Pilot**  
_Current Status:_ Actively working on this.  Currently working on second phase of work.  
We are developing a pilot sign-in service, in partnership with non-SSO VA.gov-ecosystem applications. This pilot will investigate the possibility of minimizing redirects, improving service reliability, and modernizing protocols. This pilot will help address ongoing concerns by business partners and Veterans. Research and development are underway, with an MVP expected in Q1'22.

**Inherited Proofing**  
_Current Status:_ Initial research is done.  Next up is accessibility research.
We are working to provide a framework for users to migrate from legacy Credential Service Providers such as MyHealtheVet to more modern providers such as Login.gov.  This includes tools to help users select a new CSP that meets their needs, as well as validating that users are eligible to migrate to these CSPs.  The goal of this work is to provide users a more uniform, secure experience across government services.


**Alerting Improvements**  
_Current Status:_ Actively working on this  
We are working to streamline our alerting and monitoring systems to reduce alert noise and improve accuracy, allowing us to more accurately and efficiently track and resolve issues.
