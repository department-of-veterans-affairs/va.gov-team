# Troubleshooting Authentication Errors

Authentication error codes are generated by the API when an error is detected. A user is then redirected back to VA.gov with that error code in the browser address bar (example `https://va.gov/auth/login/callback/?auth=fail&code=001`).  Error codes can be found in two places, either on the page at the bottom or in the URL bar. Below is a collection of those error codes along with possible troubleshooting steps.

## Troubleshooting

  <summary>
    <h3 id="user-denied">001 - Authorization Denied by User</h3>
  </summary>

#### Why does it happen?
The Authorization Denied by User error usually occurs when a user who signs in with ID.me and clicks the **"Deny"** button on the final page of the identity verification process when authorizing sharing information with VA.gov and ID.me.

#### How to troubleshoot: 
1. Ask the User to clear their cookies & cache
2. Try to Sign in again with their credential provider
3. When prompted on ID.me to share your information with VA.gov, click the **"Accept"** on the final page of the identity verification process
4. User continues to sign in as normal

<details>
  <summary>
    <h3 id="user-time-bad">002 - User system time is incorrect</h3>
  </summary>

#### Why does it happen?
This can happen when a user's computer date and time is set manually to the incorrect local browsers time rather than automatically setting time in the users system settings. This causes a user to be signed out or enter into an authentication loop because the browser believes the session is expired because the local system time is past or too far behind the current time.

#### How to troubleshoot: 
1. On a User's computer, ask them to locate the Date and Time
    1. **Windows**:
        1. Right-click on the time in the bottom-right of the screen and selected **Adjust Date/Time** (opens a new window)
        2. On the left-side of the window select the **Date & time** tab.
        3. Ensure a user has the **Set time automatically** enabled (On)
        4. Ensure a user has the **Set time zone automatically** enabled (On)
    2. **Mac**:
        1. Click the Apple icon (top left)
        2. Select System Preferences
        3. Click the Date & Time
        4. Ensure a user has the **Set date and time automatically** enabled (checked)
2. Have the User attempt to Sign in again with their credential provider
3. User continues to sign in as normal

<details>
  <summary>
    <h3 id="server-time-bad">003 - API Server time is incorrect</h3>
  </summary>

#### Why does it happen?
This error occurs when the `tzinfo` (time zone information) on VA.gov's API server is misconfigured or missing.

#### How to troubleshoot: 
1. Ask the User to clear their cookies & cache
2. Try to Sign in again with their credential provider
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <h3 id="mpi-mismatch">004 - MPI Mismatch</h3>
  </summary>

#### Why does it happen?
An internal VA.gov user system lookup may not be available to confirm the user data matches the current session information. If the troubleshooting steps below do not resolve the issue then it is recommended that the user call the help desk to allow the MPI team to resolve the users error.

#### How to troubleshoot: 
1. Ask the User to clear their cookies & cache
2. Try to Sign in again with their credential provider
3. If the above steps do not resolve the issue, create a ticket with the help desk
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <h3 id="session-expired">005 - Session Expired</h3>
  </summary>

#### Why does it happen?
This usually occurs when a session was invalidated during the Sign in process or the user was inactive for a period of 30 minutes or more on VA.gov.

#### How to troubleshoot: 
1. Ask the User to clear their cookies & cache
2. Try to Sign in again with their credential provider
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <h3 id="default-unknown">007 - Default/Unknown Error</h3>
  </summary>

#### Why does it happen?
This error can occur for a variety of different reasons. Sometimes we are not sure what the error is and it doesn't match any of our other errors OR we don't want to display the error to the user in certain cases like token theft flag, date of death is set, etc. If the below troubleshooting steps do not resolve the issue they user should contact the help desk.

#### How to troubleshoot: 
1. Ask the User to clear their cookies & cache
2. Try to Sign in again with their credential provider
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <h3 id="failure-to-proof">009 - Failure to Proof (Login.gov)</h3>
  </summary>

#### Why does it happen?
This error occurs only with the Login.gov service provider and happens when a user encounters an error when trying to prove their identity through Login.gov's workflow.  This can happen if a user exits out of the workflow voluntarily, provides the wrong phone number, provides an inaccurate/malformed social security number, and several other internal verification issues.

#### How to troubleshoot: 
1. Confirm with the user the Login.gov's workflow that was previously attempted (verifying phone number, SSN, etc.)
2. Re-attempt to perform the verification process on login.gov to determine if the updated/corrected information resolves the issue
3. If the first two steps do not resolve the issue, create a ticket with the contact center to update the users MPI record (SSN) or have them update their own phone number

  <summary>
    <h3 id="multiple-mhv-ids">101 - Multiple MHV IDs (multiple IENs)</h3>
  </summary>

#### Why does it happen?
This error occurs when a user signs in with their My HealtheVet credential and there are multiple IDs associated with their account.  This is only an issue on VA.gov and not the My HealtheVet website.  VA.gov's API is unable to compare which MHV ID is the most recent/active ID and is unable to perform lookups against multiple IDs at the same time.

#### How to troubleshoot: 
1. Create a ticket with the help desk

</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <h3 id="multiple-edipis">102 - Multiple EDIPIs</h3>
  </summary>

#### Why does it happen?
This is due to an internal VA system reporting multiple identifiers for a user. This must be resolved manually and reported to the help desk.

#### How to troubleshoot: 
1. Create a ticket with the help desk

<details>
  <summary>
    <h3 id="uuid-missing">104 - UUID Missing</h3>
  </summary>

#### Why does it happen?
This error is encountered when a user attempts to sign in with their credentials for either DS Logon or My HealtheVet.  A UUID is required to lookup the user and is only generated via ID.me or Login.gov. Therefore if a user has never signed in with either ID.me or Login.gov, the API cannot cross-reference and lookup their information in MPI. Attempting a second login on VA.gov should resolve the issue. We do occasionally see the browser obtain a cached response on subsequent logins, if the steps below do not resolve the issue we ask that the user wait 30 minutes and attempt the login again. If this doesn't resolve the issue a help desk ticket should be created.

#### How to troubleshoot: 
1. Ask the User to clear their cookies & cache
2. Try to Sign in again with their credential provider

</details>


<details>
  <summary>
    <h3 id="multiple-corp-ids">106 - Multiple Corp IDs</h3>

1. Create a ticket with the help desk

</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <h3 id="mhv-verification-error">108 - MHV Verification Error</h3>
  </summary>

#### Why does it happen?
This occurs when a My HealtheVet Basic user is requesting access to a service that requires a My HealtheVet Premium account.  Usually occurs when using the Sign in Service on the Unified Sign in Page for any application with a `client_id=mobile`.

#### How to troubleshoot: 
1. This is an issue the My HealtheVet user can fix on their own by upgrading their My HealtheVet Basic account to a Premium account.
2. User can [follow the steps on the AuthApp page](https://va.gov/auth/login/callback/?code=108) to upgrade their account or [upgrade to Premium by following these instructions](https://www.va.gov/resources/get-a-premium-my-healthevet-account/)
