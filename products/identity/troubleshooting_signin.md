# Troubleshooting Authentication Errors

Authentication error codes are generated by the API when an error is detected. A user is then redirected back to VA.gov with that error code in the browser address bar (example `https://va.gov/auth/login/callback/?auth=fail&code=001`).  Error codes can be found in two places, either on the page at bottom or in the URL bar. Below is a collection of those error codes along with possible troubleshooting steps.

    <h2>001 - Authorization Denied by User</h2>
  </summary>

#### Why does it happen
The Authorization Denied by User error usually occurs when a user who signs in with ID.me does not click the button to authorize information sharing between ID.me and VA.gov

#### How to troubleshoot: 
1. Ask the User to clear their cookies & cache
2. Try to Sign in again with their credential provider
3. When prompted on ID.me to share information between ID.me & VA.gov, click Approve
4. User continues to sign in as normal

    <h2>002 - User system clock is incorrect</h2>

#### Why does it happen
This can happen when a user's computer date and time is set manually rather than automatically causing a user to be signed out or enter into a authentication loop.

#### How to troubleshoot: 
1. On a User's computer, ask them to locate the Date and Time
  a. (Windows):
    1. Right-click on the time in the bottom-right of the screen and selected **Adjust Date/Time** (opens a new window)
    2. On the left-side of the window select the **Date & time** tab.
    3. Ensure a user has the **Set time automatically** enabled (On)
    4. Ensure a user has the **Set time zone automatically** enabled (On)
  b. (Mac)
    1. Click the Apple icon (top left)
    2. Select System Prefrences
    3. Click the Date & Time
    4. Ensure a user has the **Set date and time automatically** enabled (checked)
2. Have the User attempt to Sign in again with their credential provider
3. User continues to sign in as normal
