# Sep 2023 PACT Act Traffic Surge

## Load Testing Results

This report provides an overview of the results from the HTTP load test conducted on 07SEP2023. The purpose of this test was to assess the performance and stability of the VA.gov authentication process.

## Endpoints Tested:

- v0/user
- auth/login/callback
- sessions/*
- sign_in/*

## Standard usage

- VA.gov avg user logins per minute: `166`
- PACT Act deadline (8/8-8/15) VA.gov Authentication numbers:
- `2,720,000` total logins
    - `340,000` per day
    - `14,166` per hour
    - `236` per minute

## Test Environment

- Load Testing Tool: loadster.app
- Test Duration: Two 3 minute tests
- Number of Concurrent Users: 500
- Test Scenarios: 1m ramp to 500 users. 1m peak users. 1m drop down to 0 users

## Procedure

- To use the free version, work with a total of five people to make a [loadster.app](http://loadster.app) account. Each person must do the following:
    - Record an authentication process within [loadster.app](http://loadster.app) browser recorder app
    - Click on the play button to ensure your test will run at least one time

    - Set the number of bots to ~110
    - Set the ramp up, peak load, and ramp down to 1 minute

    - Click Launch test
- The test above is run once with oauth=false which simulates standard VA.gov SSOe, the second test will run with oauth=true which simulates the backup authentication solution if SSOe were to go down on VA.gov.

### Performance Analysis

During the course of the test, vets-api scaled up two additional pods and handled our initial authentication requests without an issue.

The main issue observed during the performance test was related to ID.me’s throttling of the requests we made to them over the 3 minute tests. In both test runs we were seeing ID.me display a page which indicated to the user they were in a queue to login:

## Recommendations

Based on the test results, we do not recommend any changes to the code or architecture. We do recommend the consideration of switching to Sign in Service on production during the last week of the PACT act, even if for just 50% of the users to reduce the likelihood that the IAM ISVA instances become overloaded. Otherwise, based on the test results run on staging today, we are confident all vets-api routes related to authentication will operate unfazed with the expected increase of traffic.

## Conclusion

The `vets-api` authentication controllers will not break under the upcoming PACT Act traffic surge. Our tests simulated 1000 users logging in per minute and the anticipated traffic for the next PACT Act deadline only expects to see roughly 600 users per minute at its peak. Based on our findings today, we do expect a few additional pods to spin up during peak traffic but that vets-api will handle it in stride with little to no user impact.
