- **Takeaway**: When asked if there was anything else they'd like to share, P8 shared frustrations with 2FA:
  
> I always have to do two factor authentication on the website. I would like the option of don’t require 2FA each time I log in with this specific computer and this IP address. It gets a little annoying. I think it actualy does give me that option but it never remembers it...As soon as the page times out, I have to do it again.

- **Takeaway**: P2 began and ended their session talking about challenges with logging in. Specifically they mentioned frustrations around two-factor authentciation, and getting "kicked out" and having to sign back in elsewhere.

>I’m trying to go in and look at my appointments or something. And then, I said shoot, my phone is downstairs in the car. I have to go downstairs and get my phone, I have to power it on, or it’s not charged.  

>I tried to do something online and I signed back in and it kicked me out. And I signed in again and it kicked me out. And then I have to try a different browser just to stay logged in.

- **Takeaway**: One participant in the study didn't interact with any elements in the site header for the duration of their session because they have such a hard time signing in, and were afraid of getting signed out.
