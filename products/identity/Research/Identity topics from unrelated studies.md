### Study name: MyHealtheVet+VA Online Scheduling appointments list discovery
- **Team/Researcher:** Christine Rose Steiffer, Authenticated Experience Design Patterns
- **Date:** Aug 2024
- **Link to study:** [Research folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/authenticated-patterns/Design%20and%20Research/2024-07-Research%20Initiative-One-Prefill)
- **Takeaway:** [Finding 1:](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/authenticated-patterns/Design%20and%20Research/2024-07-Research%20Initiative-One-Prefill/Prefill%20Research%20Report%2009_2024.md#finding-1-veterans-dont-understand-what-is-meant-by-profile-data-and-some-conflate-vagov-data-with-their-method-of-authentication-logingov-idme-or-mhv) Veterans don’t understand what is meant by ‘profile data’ and some conflate VA.gov data with their method of authentication (Login.gov, ID.me or MHV).
   - Veterans used a variety of words to describe where they thought their data was pulled from to display in the prototype. This included words such as account, information, profile, records, permanent record, and in the cloud among others.
   -  Many of our participants expressed confusion around their data and it’s association, or lack thereof, with whichever authentication service they used to login to VA.gov (such as Login.gov, ID.me and MyHealtheVet). They thought that if they made changes to their VA.gov profile data, it would update their authentication platform data as well. One even thought that it would update any other platforms that were connected to their Login.gov account, such as SSA.gov.

   >I would think [my records are pulled] from login.gov like when you're you sign in 'cause login.gov is also SSA and… it's also your medical records. P13


### Study name: Federal Header Authenticated Menu Usability
- **Team/Researcher:** Liz Lantz, Authentciated Experience
- **Date:** 1/31/2024
- **Link to study:** [Research folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/discovery-research/authenticated-menu-usability)
- **Takeaway**: A screenreader participant, who had very little experience using the web or signing into websites, listened to the sign-in modal. After listening to the dialog box, they assumed they needed to call in to create an account. The rest of the content in the modal made no sense to them and they weren't sure how to proceed.  It's probably appropriate for them to call and get help, given the lack of familiarty with signing into websites.


### Study name: MHV on VA.gov secondary navigation comparison research
- **Team/Researcher:** My HealtheVet on VA.gov Cartography Team
- **Date:** 1/25/2024
- **Link to study:** [Research folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/secondary-nav/Comparison-study)
- **Takeaway**: At the beginning of their session, P6 talked about how confusing it is to have multiple sign-in options. ([session notes](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/secondary-nav/Comparison-study/session-notes/2024-1-25-p6.md#p6))

  > That’s a good question because when I sign in, there’s like 3 or 4 different access points, and I have been trying to use, and it keeps coming up, the newest one that’s there, although I think I’m using ID.me lately. But, frankly, it’s al little bit confusing which one to use. Sometimes they pass you to another place where you have to enter the password again to get in. I have used other sites for other research and interest I have about faiciltes and recreational opportunities but pretty much I go tot he top one. And life would be so much easier for me if there was only one.

### Study name: Federal HF usability testing--Phase 1
- **Team/Researcher:** Sitewide, Cindy Merrill
- **Date:** 12/20/20203
- **Link to study:** [Research folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/header-footer/initiatives/2024-federal-standardized-header-footer/research/phase1-no-AT)
- **Takeaway**: When asked if there was anything else they'd like to share, P8 shared frustrations with 2FA:
  
> I always have to do two factor authentication on the website. I would like the option of don’t require 2FA each time I log in with this specific computer and this IP address. It gets a little annoying. I think it actualy does give me that option but it never remembers it...As soon as the page times out, I have to do it again.

### Study name: Veteran Status, Use Case Discovery
- **Team/Researcher:** Veteran Status, Cara Frissell
- **Date:** 12/18/2023
- **Link to study:** [Research folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/veteran-status/Research/2023-12-VetStatus-Use-Case-Discovery)
- **Takeaway**: P2 began and ended their session talking about challenges with logging in. Specifically they mentioned frustrations around two-factor authentciation, and getting "kicked out" and having to sign back in elsewhere.

>I’m trying to go in and look at my appointments or something. And then, I said shoot, my phone is downstairs in the car. I have to go downstairs and get my phone, I have to power it on, or it’s not charged.  

>I tried to do something online and I signed back in and it kicked me out. And I signed in again and it kicked me out. And then I have to try a different browser just to stay logged in.


### Study name: 526 Shadowing
- **Team/Researcher:** 526EZ Evelyn Hilbrich Davis, Julie Pedke, and Nichole Nicholas
- **Date:** Nov 2023
- **Link to study:** [2023-11-Shadowing-Research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/research/2023-11-Shadowing-Research/research-findings.md)
- **Takeaway:**
   - P10 had an interesting sequence (likely mostly stemming from reseting password)
      - signed in (vai Login.gov) at the form page, but couldn't remember password
      - reset password (off screeen share)
      - Signed back in at on VA branded Login.gov, and did MFA code
      - Back on VA got back to the form page, clicked button to start the form and went to /verfiy page
      - clicked through to Login.gov - had to sign in again, MFA again, and then saw "Reactivate your Account" page on Login.gov
      - this page required the Personal Key which the participant confused at first with MFA.
      - when clicked the option for "don't have personal key" it them required ID verification, which participant mentioned doing just a few days ago.
   - Another had to go to another room to get their phone for MFA.
   - Another was already signed in before session start and had to sign back in due to inactivity.
   - I saw was P12 came up with the double MFA. Likely due to having set up MFA with DS Logon, and then having the forced MFA from the ID.me “MFA wrapper”


### Study name: Logged-in wayfinding and navigation research

- **Takeaway**: One participant in the study didn't interact with any elements in the site header for the duration of their session because they have such a hard time signing in, and were afraid of getting signed out.

> I was actually afraid that if I clicked everything outside of this _mouses over 4 main boxes on homepage_ I would get signed out. - P6

### Study name: Ask VA: Submit an inquiry (Round 1)
- **Team/Researcher:** Ask VA, Tyler Gindraux
- **Date:** February 2024
- **Link to study:** [Findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/design/User%20research/01-2024%20Submit%20an%20inquiry/Findings.md)
- **Takeaway**: Many Veterans shared issues they have with signing in. One participant mentioned being 'kicked out' and having to sign back in, sometimes multiple times in a day. Another participant shared that their son, who is under 18, needed to fill out a GI Bill form. But they weren't able to (or didn't think they were able to) create their own sign in credential/account without a state-issued ID:

> "There is never anything that says, 'Remember this device.' There have been times where I've had to log in multiple times during the day and every time I got to wait on that doggone secure access code verification code, whatever you want to call it. I mean, this is a desktop computer. I'm not taking it anywhere. I'm mobility challenged. That kind of stuff, not being able to just click it to sign in. Remember this device."

> "To be able to sign up and register your own account online - besides being 18 – you need to give the VA a proof of ID, a state ID. Usually I guess they're thinking about driving license. Well, my son [...] doesn't have any driving license. [...] So he doesn't have any state ID. His only ID is a US passport. [...] And the VA doesn't take it on the list of acceptable ID, they only take state ID. That doesn't make any sense. So we couldn't apply for its benefits for these main two reasons, he is not 18 yet and he doesn't have a state ID only a passport."
