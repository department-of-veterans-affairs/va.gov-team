# Participants' mentions of identity topics from unrealted studies
If anything comes up related to Identity Team work (e.g. sign in, sign out, MFA, session length, securty, fraud) in a study where you weren't already working with the Identity Team, please document it here and/or reach out to Clayton Zook in DSVA Slack [#identity-research-public channel](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C04S98PE8FK) or [#vsp-identity channel](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/CSFV4QTKN)

- **Takeaway**: One participant in the study didn't interact with any elements in the site header for the duration of their session because they have such a hard time signing in, and were afraid of getting signed out.

> I was actually afraid that if I clicked everything outside of this _mouses over 4 main boxes on homepage_ I would get signed out. - P6
