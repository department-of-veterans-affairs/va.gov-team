  > That’s a good question because when I sign in, there’s like 3 or 4 different access points, and I have been trying to use, and it keeps coming up, the newest one that’s there, although I think I’m using ID.me lately. But, frankly, it’s al little bit confusing which one to use. Sometimes they pass you to another place where you have to enter the password again to get in. I have used other sites for other research and interest I have about faiciltes and recreational opportunities but pretty much I go tot he top one. And life would be so much easier for me if there was only one.

- **Takeaway**: When asked if there was anything else they'd like to share, P8 shared frustrations with 2FA:
  
> I always have to do two factor authentication on the website. I would like the option of don’t require 2FA each time I log in with this specific computer and this IP address. It gets a little annoying. I think it actualy does give me that option but it never remembers it...As soon as the page times out, I have to do it again.

- **Takeaway**: P2 began and ended their session talking about challenges with logging in. Specifically they mentioned frustrations around two-factor authentciation, and getting "kicked out" and having to sign back in elsewhere.

>I’m trying to go in and look at my appointments or something. And then, I said shoot, my phone is downstairs in the car. I have to go downstairs and get my phone, I have to power it on, or it’s not charged.  

>I tried to do something online and I signed back in and it kicked me out. And I signed in again and it kicked me out. And then I have to try a different browser just to stay logged in.

- **Takeaway**: One participant in the study didn't interact with any elements in the site header for the duration of their session because they have such a hard time signing in, and were afraid of getting signed out.

> I was actually afraid that if I clicked everything outside of this _mouses over 4 main boxes on homepage_ I would get signed out. - P6
