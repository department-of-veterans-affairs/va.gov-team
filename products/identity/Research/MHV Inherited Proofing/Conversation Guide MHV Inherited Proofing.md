## **Introduction**
Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Amanda or Samuel], and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we are going to talk about the process of moving to a more secure, modern login provider. Today, we want to learn how to improve this login experience for Veterans.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

* There are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions, so that we can improve the application and meet Veterans' needs.
* I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.
* This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to the next question.
* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
* In this session, I'll be having you share your Zoom screen so that I can follow along and we'll help you through that.
* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete the analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
    * If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

Start recording.

* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## **Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes**

Before we look at the prototype, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

> *Background info about the participant should have been provided by Coordinator already, so use this time to ask any other questions that you feel will help with the session. This warm-up is not required*

Before we look at the prototype, can you tell me a little about yourself?

- What part of the country do you live in?
- What branch did you serve?
- What device do you use often to access your healthcare?
- How often do you use your computer at home?
    - Tell me about the last time you login to VA.gov?
    - Have you ever signed in to any other government sites (for example Social Security, USAJobs, IRS, or Federal Student Loans)?
    - How is that experience different or similar to VA.gov?

### **Task 1 - Email Correspondence: 5-10 minutes**

We put together a prototype we would love to get your feedback on [chat participant link to]

Reminder: Again, it’s really helpful as you talk aloud as you're looking through things.

- Would you be comfortable with screen-sharing your login account transition with me and talking me through your experience?

> ### Scenario 1 (Optional)
> Imagine that you have received [an email with] information from VA.gov that has informed you about the transition of your MHV account to Login.gov (Share image of email with participant)

Please take a few minutes to read the email
1. What are your thoughts on the email and its content
2. How do you feel about receiving this information through email
3. How would you proceed?
4. What information do you feel is the most important? Least important?

> ### Scenario 2
> Imagine you just signed in using your My Healthy Vet account [or task participant mentioned above]. You see  this pop-up modal.

### **Task 2 - Sign-in to Transition screen: 2-5 minutes**

(With a task in mind) Sign-in to VA.gov
1. Could you describe to me what is on screen?
2. What do you think this screen/modal is asking you to do?
3. How would you proceed?

### **Task 3 - Closed Modal / Dimiss (Optional): 7-10 minutes**
(If the participant would close screen/ dimissed)
1. Could you explain your decision to dismiss?
2. What would you expect to happen after you dismiss?
3. When would you expect to see this screen again?
4. How often do you read pop-up modals?
5. Can you recall a situation when you were promoted by a pop-up modal to get through a website?
6. What did you dislike about the pop-up modal?
7. How do you think about creating a new login is going to help you?
8. If you had a magic wand, what would you change?

### **Task 4 - Completing transition (Optional): 10-15 minutes**

Complete the login account transition process
1. Could you explain your decision to continue transitioning now?
2. What were your thoughts about the transition process?
3. How did you feel about the quality of information you received during the transition process?
    - Follow-on: How did this impact you?
4. What would your friend/partner/veteran think about the login account transition?

### Things to watch for:

- Does a user close out the modal?
- How do they interact with the modal if at all?
- How are they reacting to the login account transition?
- Are they reading the modal information?
- Are they reading the consent page?
- How long did it take a user to get through the login account transition?
- How do participants feel about sharing personal information?
- Why is the 2FA asking for their phone number?
