## Background
This research is for the Office of the CTO - Digital Experience (OCTODE) - Identity Team Leads for VA.gov. This research is being informed by moderated (August), unmoderated (October), and moderated (December) studies that were conducted in 2021. The three studies focused on the Veteran sign-in experience on VA.gov, specifically changes to the sign-in modal. With this research, the Identity team hopes to understand the user experience on VA.gov to better inform practices for sign-in and inherited proofing.

With the Unified Sign In page, and the rollout of Login.gov in 2022, we will start transitioning users to their choice of Login.gov or ID.me. We need UI/UX research and design to help develop a seamless experience for users to be informed of the change and easily choose a new credential.

MHV users will soon be directed to VA.gov with a new design informing them that they will need to choose a new credential for signing to access products and services, that will potentially include the need to identity proof again, or for certain eligible users, the ability to have an inherited proofing status with their account . Creating an easily navigable experience is crucial. This experience when signed in through ID.me, MHV, or DS Logon through VA.gov will be new for all users that are anticipated to be part of the research. For users that have been to VA.gov, the design is built with similar patterns, designs, and experiences that already exist on VA.gov.


## Research Goals:
Create a simple experience for users to go through inherited proofing. Specifically, the goal of this study is to discover any pain points.

- This research will inform design, content, or functionality changes needed to increase accessibility on VA.gov and to address any pain points with the flow of the inherited proofing process.
- Learnings will be incorporated into future design, content, and functionality and shared with other teams to inform modal considerations of other products and services
- The results will also be used to inform subsequent rounds of user research and testing.
