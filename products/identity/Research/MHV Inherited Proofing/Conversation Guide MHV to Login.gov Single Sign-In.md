## **Introduction**
Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Amanda or Samuel], and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we are going to talk about the process of moving to a more secure, modern login provider. Our goal of this research is to learn more about how we can improve this login experience for Veterans and understand the impact of migrating to a login provider. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

* There are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions, so that we can improve the application and meet Veterans' needs.

* I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.
* This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to the next question.

* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.

* In this session, I'll be having you share your Zoom screen so that I can follow along and we'll help you through that.

* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete the analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
	* If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

*[Start recording.]*

* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
