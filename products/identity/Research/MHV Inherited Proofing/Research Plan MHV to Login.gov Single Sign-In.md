# Research Plan for [Identity, MHV Migration to Login.gov Single Sign-on, 7/13/22]

## Background

This research is for the Office of the CTO - Digital Experience (OCTODE) - Identity Team Leads for VA.gov. This research is being informed by moderated (August), unmoderated (October), and moderated (December) studies that were conducted in 2021. The three studies focused on the Veteran sign-in experience on VA.gov specifically changes to the sign-in modal. With this research, the Identity team hopes to understand the user experience on VA.gov to better inform practices for sign-in and inherited proofing.

With the Unified Sign In page and the rollout of Login.gov in 2022, we will start transitioning users to their choice of Login.gov or ID.me. We need UI/UX research and design to help develop a seamless experience for users to be informed of the change and easily choose a new credential.

MHV users will soon be directed to VA.gov with a new design informing them that they will need to choose a new credential for signing to access products and services, which will potentially include the need to identity proof again, or for certain ineligible users, the ability to have an inherited proofing status with their account. Creating an easily navigable experience is crucial. This experience when signed in through ID.me, MHV, or DS Logon through VA.gov will be new for all users that are anticipated to be part of the research. For users that have been to VA.gov, the design is built with similar patterns, designs, and experiences that already exist on VA.gov.

### OCTO Objectives

>Which [OCTO objectives] (https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

6.) Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

- Veterans can manage their account to a consolidated login
- Veterans can decide the best CSP for their needs
- Veterans and their families can apply for all benefits online
- Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information

_All of the above are dependent on an easy and secure sign-in experience_



### Veteran Journey
>Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)?<br>Are there moments that matter?

Our product fits in at the start of the Veteran Journey from “Serving in the Military” through to “Getting Out” and “Starting Up.”  Additionally serving the Veteran throughout their entire journey, as they may receive VA services throughout their life.

Starting Up
- Finding something to do
- Re-establishing and creating relationships
- Attending to health needs


Our product fits into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) at the Starting Up of myself Life Stage. At this moment a veteran is looking for help and support for their health.

Taking care of self
- Managing primary care and chronic health issues
- Maintaining my health
- Seeking support for an acute health event

## Research Goals    
>What are you trying to learn from this research?

This research aims to gauge user sentiment about the transition to a single sign-on provider

### Outcome
>How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings? 

- This research will inform design decisions and content development for the account transition page on va.gov that will potentially offer only Login.gov or suggest Login.gov as a preferred option.
- This research will uncover potential pain points in the proposed transition process. The data can be leveraged to simplify the process for many user groups on va.gov including but not limited to those with accessibility needs.

- Learnings will be incorporated into future design, content, and functionality and shared with other teams
- The results will also be used to inform subsequent rounds of user research and usability testing

### Research questions

1. What concerns do users have about transitioning to a single sign-in provider?
2. What concerns or questions do users have about Login.gov?
3. Is the proposed transition the simplest flow to move users to a login.gov account?
4. Do users understand what they are being asked to do?
5. Do users understand the information being presented to them on the transition page?
6. Does this strategy (dropping the choice between ID.ME and Login.gov) generate any questions or concerns for users?
7. What factors contribute to a successful user experience within the transition process? (Time? Ease of use? Quality of information?)
8. How long does it take to complete the transition process?


### Hypothesis
>What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.

If a user is provided with a single sign-in option that lays out the specific requirements of email address, password, and MFA, then they will readily make the choice to transition to a new account [at the time of sign-in.]


## Method    
>Describe the method you’re planning. You should be able to explain why this method is appropriate for the goals of the research and the maturity of the design.

Remote moderated usability test via the application that can satisfy our criteria:
- Being able to record the session
- Being able to record the user's screen

Our goals include:
- Observe how users would navigate the transition process to a Login.gov account from the point of sign in through creating an account in the Login.gov workflow.
- Discover any inconsistencies regarding a user's journey for consenting information

>What method of research are you planning to use?
Remote, semi-moderated sessions
- We will need to use a video conferencing tool that allows users to record and share their screen(s) while using a low to mid-fidelity prototype.

>Why this method? How does this help you answer your research questions?
- We can see how users navigate.
- We can see where users are having difficulty in different areas of the inherited proofing experience.

## Recruitment    

_OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers._

_Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources._
- [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance] (https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/perigean-recruiting-guidance.md) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research.
- [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies] (https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach
>Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them?

- Intended Audience: MHV account holders that are Ineligible/Basic who do not have a Login.gov account.

- Perigean will recruit.

### Recruitment criteria
> List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study.

- A total of 20 Veterans use a Basic (Ineligible) My Healthy Vet account.
    - Participants should not have done any in-person identity proofing

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
>What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study?

>_Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these, verbatim, to recruit participants. Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question._
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

_Screening questions for recruitment:_
1. Do you use VA.gov (not to be confused with MyHealtheVet or E-benefits) to access your Veteran benefits and services?
2.Have you verified your identity in-peron with a MyHealtheVet coordinator or staff to get set up with your MHV account? (preferred answer would be "NO")


- At least half of the participants have a **basic** My Healthy Vet account.
- At least half of the participants have have logged into VA.gov within the last 6 months.
- At least two people under the age of 30
- At least two people over the age of 55-64+
