## Key Findings

### Federal Standards Matter

- Whether filing taxes, enrolling in healthcare, or legal inquiries, users rely on federal websites for accurate and timely information.
- Availability is not an abstract concept; it directly impacts citizens’ lives. 
- Federal guidelines state the importance of maintaining public access to secure digital services where transparency and accountability are ensured.
- Users return to a website they trust, knowing it won’t fail them during critical moments.
- A consistently available website signals preparedness, efficiency, and commitment.
   - Positive interactions build confidence.
- Guidelines for data visualization and accessibility, within Section 508 and WCAG 2.2, are important for presenting uptime, downtime, and other availability metrics on federal website dashboards in a way that is clear, usable, and understandable for all users. 


### Learnings From Federal Website Availability Issues
- Proactive notifications of downtime, and adherence to downtime schedules, can reduce frustration and maintain public trust.
- To determine whether it is safe to scale up a program, stress test a prototype before a public rollout with participants.
- Use an incremental rollout approach to ensure that issues can be addressed in real-time, following industry best practices.
- A website's sign-in screen may become a bottleneck if it isn’t designed to handle as much traffic as the main site.
- Provide website support technicians a different sign-in screen to access the site when troubleshooting problems (In case the sign-in screen is unavailable).
- Having consistent operating times for federal sites requires setting availability metrics in each case responsibly and meaningfully.
  - Some sites have a 90% target associated with this measure.
  - This allows for some variance across several products due to unanticipated or external factors.
- Section 508 standards apply to ICT products and services that are developed, maintained, or used by the Federal government.

## Introduction

Performance.gov selected two services of the Department of Veteran's Affairs as part of the nation’s High Impact Service Providers (HISPs) to raise the standard of government service delivery.

HISPs are selected due to the scale and critical nature of their public-facing services. Annually, HISP teams conduct comprehensive assessments of their high-impact services, measure their customer experience maturity, and identify actions to improve service delivery.

| Department of Veterans Affairs | Veterans Health Administration |
|:--- | :--- |
| Accessing VBA education benefits | Utilizing in-person primary care |
| Using the VBA decision review process | Utilizing inpatient medical/acute care |
| Accessing VBA Disability Compensation benefits | |

It is essential to display uptime, downtime, errors, and other availability information in an effective way that fosters trust, transparency, and a positive customer experience for veterans. 


### Customer Experience and Trust

There is a growing body of research that suggests a primary driver of trust in government are peoples’ individual experiences with public services. HISPs are increasingly collecting feedback from customers, with a particular focus on post-transaction surveys during customer interactions with priority designated services. 

Transparency regarding website availability is crucial for building trust with VA website users, particularly veterans seeking critical information and services. 

Numerous studies have documented the importance of website responsiveness and minimal downtime for user satisfaction, in addition to the strong correlation between website performance and customer experience. 

- A study by [Forrester Research](https://www.forrester.com/) indicates that a one-second delay in page load time can decrease customer satisfaction by 7%. 

- According to the Federal IT Dashboard, only 30% of federal websites have no detectable accessibility issues.

- Less than 20% of federal websites use code from the U.S. Web Design System (USWDS), leading to inconsistent user experiences.

- Research by OMB revealed 45% of federal websites are not mobile friendly.

- The [Uptime Institute](https://uptimeinstitute.com/) reports that unplanned downtime can cost businesses millions of dollars per hour. 

While the VA is not a for-profit business, unplanned outages can have a significant negative impact on veterans' ability to access essential services. 
Downtime can lead to significant consequences, frustration, and impede veterans from applying for benefits, scheduling appointments, or refilling prescriptions online. 

**A well-designed dashboard displaying real-time availability metrics can address these concerns in several ways**

**Manage User Expectations**
- By informing users about potential downtime or ongoing maintenance, the VA can set realistic expectations and minimize frustration. 
- For instance, the dashboard could clearly communicate the expected duration of maintenance windows or highlight periods of peak usage that might lead to slower response times. 
   - This proactive communication can help veterans plan their online interactions and avoid scheduling important tasks during known downtime.

**Promote Transparency**
- Open communication regarding website health builds trust and demonstrates the VA's commitment to user experience.
- A well-designed dashboard can showcase the VA's investment in website uptime and reliability.
- By acknowledging potential issues and providing updates, the VA fosters a sense of transparency and accountability.

**Empower Users**
- Access to service availability information empowers veterans to make informed decisions about their online interactions with the VA.
- The dashboard can provide veterans with the knowledge to plan their tasks to access services during optimal uptimes.
   - For example, if the dashboard indicates a period of expected heavy traffic, veterans can choose to schedule important tasks for a different time or utilize alternative channels to access VA services.

Load Testing

- Simulate heavy traffic to assess the site’s performance under stress.
- Use tools like Apache JMeter or Locust to create load tests.
- Gradually increase the number of concurrent users and monitor how the site handles the load.
- Identify bottlenecks, slow responses, or resource exhaustion.
- Adjust server configurations or optimize code as needed.

Failover Testing

- Test failover scenarios
   - Temporarily take down the main site (e.g., during maintenance or updates).
   - Verify that the backup authentication system (if any) seamlessly takes over.
   - Ensure users can still sign in without disruption.
- Document the failover process and ensure it’s well-documented for the operations team.

Geographical Testing

- Use tools that simulate requests from different geographical locations.
- Verify that the main site remains accessible globally.

Logging and Monitoring

- Implement robust logging
- Log sign-in attempts, errors, and response times.
- Monitor logs for anomalies or patterns.
- Set up alerts based on log data:
   - Detect unusual spikes in traffic or sudden errors.
- Investigate promptly if any issues arise.

Backup and Redundancy

- Ensure redundancy for critical components.
- Use multiple servers or cloud instances.
- Employ load balancers.
- Set up redundant databases.
- Regularly test failover mechanisms to confirm they work as expected.

## Accessible Data Visualization in Dashboards

Effective data visualization is important for presenting uptime, downtime, and availability metrics on federal website dashboards in a way that is clear and understandable for all users. 

Creating an accessible user dashboard involves thoughtful design choices that cater to users with visual impairments, cognitive limitations, and motor skill variations.

| Visualization Technique | Purpose | Use Case | Best Practices for Accessibility |
| --- | ---| ---| ---|
| Bar Charts | Compare data between categories | Uptime percentages for different federal agencies | Clear bar labels (e.g., Agency Name);  Contrasting colors for each bar; Descriptive axis labels (e.g., Uptime Percentage) |
| Line Charts | Show trends and patterns over time | Weekly or monthly website availability trends | Smooth lines for continuous data; Data points for clarity; Descriptive axis labels (e.g., Time, Availability Percentage) |
| Pie Charts (Use with Caution) | Indicate proportions or percentages | Distribution of website downtime by error type (if limited categories)|  Limit slices to a maximum of 5-6 for clarity; Include data point labels or tooltips; Consider alternative visualizations for complex data sets |
 | Tables | Present detailed data | Response times for critical agency services | Clear headers for rows and columns; Descriptive row and column labels; Accessible formatting (avoid merged cells) |
| Scatterplots (Consider for Advanced Users) | Analyze relationships between variables | Correlation between website uptime and user traffic (for advanced users) | Data point labels for identification; Clear and labeled axes; Tooltips for detailed information; Note: May not be suitable for all users due to complexity |

**Table 1**. Outlines accessible data visualization techniques, use cases, and best practices for accessibility.

## Accessibility

Tooltips and Data Points
- Provide informative tooltips or data points associated with charts and graphs.
   - These should be accessible to screen readers and offer clear descriptions of the data points upon hover or focus.
- Consider using descriptive text that complements the visual representation, and avoid relying solely on color to convey information.

Color Contrast
- Select colors with a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for small text and 3:1 for large text, as mandated by the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)
- Use color contrast checkers like [WebAIM's Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/?fcolor=FFFFFF&bcolor=E9F1FC) or [APCA's Contrast Checker](https://www.achecks.org/apca-wcag-3-accessible-colour-contrast-checker/) to assess and improve visual clarity.
- High contrast benefits users with low vision, color blindness, and those viewing the dashboard in bright sunlight.

   - *Ineffective Contrast*: A red progress bar on a light pink background can be difficult to read for users with red-green color blindness.
   - **Effective Contrast**: Change the progress bar color to dark blue for improved readability.

Font Selection
- Avoid decorative or overly stylized fonts that can be difficult to read, especially for users with dyslexia or visual processing difficulties.
- Opt for clear, easy-to-read sans-serif fonts like Verdana, Tahoma, Calibri, or Arial.
   - These fonts are common across operating systems and tend to be more legible on screens.
- Consider font size and spacing for comfortable reading. A minimum font size of 16px is recommended for body text.
- Ensure adequate line spacing to prevent crowding.
- Use system fonts whenever possible, as they are typically optimized for screen readers used by visually impaired users.
- If using custom fonts, ensure they can be substituted by user-defined fonts in assistive technologies.

   - *Ineffective Font*: Script fonts can be difficult to read, especially at small sizes. 
   - **Effective Font**: Use a clear sans-serif font like Arial at a minimum of 16px with adequate line spacing.

Simplicity Matters
- Remove unnecessary visual distractions such as animations, blinking elements, and excessive use of graphics.
   - These can be disorienting for users with epilepsy, ADHD, or cognitive disabilities.
- Keep the dashboard clean, uncluttered, and focused on essential information.
   - Users should be able to locate the information they need quickly and easily.

   - *Ineffective Design*: A dashboard with animated icons, flashing text, and a busy background image can be overwhelming. 
   - **Effective Design**: Use static icons, clear text labels, and a solid background color with minimal graphics.

Responsive Design
- Ensure the dashboard adapts to different screen sizes and devices (desktops, tablets, smartphones) using responsive design techniques.
- Responsive layouts allow users with various devices to access the information seamlessly.
- Consider element arrangement to maintain readability in both portrait and landscape orientations.

   - *Ineffective Design*: A dashboard designed only for large desktop screens becomes unusable on smaller devices. Text and buttons become too small to interact with.
   - **Effective Design**: The dashboard resizes and reorganizes elements automatically based on the screen size, ensuring optimal readability and functionality across devices.

Color Coding 
- Avoid relying solely on color to differentiate data points.
- Implement additional visual cues like shapes or patterns to accommodate users with color blindness.

Text Alternatives
- Provide meaningful descriptions (alt text) for all non-text content, including images, charts, and graphs to allow screen readers to convey information to visually impaired users.
- These descriptions should be concise and informative, accurately reflecting the visually presented data.

Keyboard Accessibility
- Ensure all dashboard functionalities are accessible using just the keyboard for users with motor skill limitations or those who prefer keyboard navigation.

----------------------------
