## Background

Determining, establishing and publishing the Service Level Objective (SLO) targets we want to hit for Veterans logging into VA.gov with the ultimate goal of continuously improving the login process to VA.gov.

We have two audiences for this information:
- Veterans logging into va.gov
- Other va.gov product teams

## Research Goals:
- Identify where data will come from
- Understand best practices around SLO's, and how similarly situated websites present SLO information to the public
