This chart is to help us decide which delegate type we move forward with

Persona | Pros | Cons | Benefits | Risks
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
**Caregiver - informal** | Delegates already accessing online?; work is with MHV/VHA which is ready for this | Many possible health actions; many possible other benefit actions; VHA paperwork is out of date for online access | VHA seems to be ready to work with us on a solution | We get bogged down in trying to solve for every health action; We successfully MVP for a few actions and delegates are upset they don't have access to all actions they need
**Caregiver - professional** | Delegates already accessing online?; working with MHV/VHA which is ready for this | Many possible health actions; VHA paperwork is out of date for online access | VHA seems to be ready to work with us on a solution | in addition to above, some states require licensure that will add complexity if our solution must confirm status
**Legal guardian** |  | These folks are probably the least uniform in need; This group has the largest unknowns; This group can include access to VHA info and to financial info; On the financial side there is already a fiduciary solution that this group can likely use |  | It takes longer to get off the ground if we need more background research; Solving for a vast variety of needs |  or choosing which to solve for
**Accredited representative, agent or attorney** | Delegates already accessing online; VA paperwork seems to be in date | Another team is working on this and our work might overlap | If there is a way for us to work with the ARP/ARF team, groundwork is already in place | We build a solution that overlaps with or doesn't work well with another solution
**Fiduciary** | Fewer actions to set up a delegate relationship for; VA paperwork seems to be in date | Fiduciaries already have FAST app for some online interactions with the VA on behalf of a veteran |  | We create a solution that is partially redundant or that very few need
**POA - power of attorney** | VA paperwork seems to be in date | These folks may not need regular access to a veteran's account | At point of decision being needed, POA has access to see necessary info to make an informed decision | Potentially sensitive topic; we build a solution that very few need
**DPAHC - health proxy or agent** | VA paperwork seems to be in date | These folks probably don't need regular access to a veteran's account | At point of decision being needed, DPAHC has access to see necessary info to make an informed decision | Sensitive topic; we build a solution that very few need
**Estate Executor** |  | These folks probably don't need regular access to a veteran's account; Would require working with NCA side which may not be as prepared to move forward with delegate access as VHA | At point of need (veteran's death), executor has access to see necessary info to execute the will | Sensitive topic; we build a solution that very few need
