# About this Research

## Background

Delegates are responsible for managing the care or finacial affairs of Veterans who are unable to do so for themselves due to incapacity, disability, or other reason. Users will lose access to sign in as a Veteran due to MHV credential deprecation. We plan to build a secure, transparent, and compliant solution to maintain access for authorized delegates while ensuring security.

   - Fidning 1 - Veterans main goal for getting a representative is to aid in fast, comprehensive, successful filing of their claims. When that goal is not met, Veterans look for alternative support.
   - Finding 4 - Veterans continuously struggled with understanding representative terms and roles.

   - Task 2 step 2 - One user, who was a friend and caregiver, assumed they were the accredited representative
   - Task 2 step 4 - Some users were concerned about medical records being released without the Veterans knowledge
   - Task 2 step 4 - One user previously encountered that if medical records were not released that the VSO would not move forward and wanted that information more front and center.
   - Additional Feedback #2 - Desire for caregiver accounts linked to Veteran information to complete tasks on Veterans behalf.
   - "I've talked about like how it would be really great to have like a login for the caregiver if the caregiver doesn't necessarily have like a, a Veteran, like a va.gov login themselves or is someone representing the, the Veteran. So like if I was just a military spouse and didn't have, you know, va.gov access instead of having me sign in under my dad's account or my husband's account, having like a secondary thing so that you, so that like you as the caregiver can sign in would be kind of nice. But I know that's like a bigger thing and not just for this project.” P8"

   - Key Finding 1 - Participants were unaware of many VA processes and policies around representatives
   - Key finding 2 - Veterans and claimants who use representation need help understanding and navigating VA processes, and do not feel equipped to handle the task themselves. This could be due to mental or medical challenges, physical disabilities, peer pressure, lack of time to commit to the task, discomfort with government processes, and many more.
   - Terminology - Many participants didn’t know what accredited representative meant and how it relates to VSOs or attorneys. Instead participants tended to focus on terms they knew such as VSO, service officer, or attorney.

   - Secondary Finding 4 - Automation/prefill was requested by some users unprompted. "Caregivers mentioned there is usually a preferred facility for the Veteran already or they make their decision based on what is closest to their address."
   - Secondary Finding 5 - VA forms listed under the Sign as Representative step caused some confusion with participants. "Caregivers expressed some confusion around the documents or process required to sign as representative - and some of those who had a POA stated it might be easier to select the Veteran sign for themselves as they were with them most of the time anyway. Most Veterans stated they would sign for themselves, but two mentioned going through a VSO or that their spouse would need to upload their document when applying."
