## Intro - 5 minutes


Thank you for joining us today. My name is [MODERATOR NAME], I’m a researcher at
[U.S. Digital Service/Login.gov]. I’m joined by my colleagues [names] who are on the
call to observe and help me take notes.

Before we start, I’ll go over what we’ll be doing today and give you a chance to ask any
questions. How does that sound?

Over the next 60 minutes, you’ll be trying out a service called Login.gov and providing feedback about your experience. We will ask you to use a test site while we observe. You will go through the steps of creating a Login.gov account and verifying
your identity. To test the system thoroughly, we ask that you enter your real information and upload real documents when asked. This will mean your real address, social security number, phone number, and state-issued photo ID. All of your information will
be securely stored on our end [and deleted after X days]. Note that although everything will look and feel real, you will not actually be creating a Login.gov account.

The most helpful thing you can do today is to talk out loud as you try out the website and tell us what you are thinking, noticing, or experiencing — especially anything that you particularly like or dislike, or anything that’s confusing or frustrating. I didn’t design the service myself, so there’s nothing you can say or do that will hurt my feelings. Your honest and open feedback is appreciated and will help improve the service for everyone.

Anything you share today will be kept confidential. Nothing that you share with me
today will be attributed back to you.

Your participation is completely voluntary. You can stop, take a break, or end the
study at any time. Just let me know. You will still receive the full gift card amount
regardless of your participation in the study.

Lastly, I wanted to confirm that you are okay with me recording today’s session.
The recordings will be only shared with the research team and deleted once our
research is complete. Is that OK with you? _[Confirm yes or no]_

Do you have any questions for me before we get started? _[Answer any questions]_

Could you start by opening up the testing link in your instruction email?
Could you now present your screen so that I can see what you’re seeing?

Looks good, thank you! I’ll start recording now. 

- If consented to recording, start recording 
- If did not consent, do not record



- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Emergency Exit
