# Conversation Guide for non-Veteran SME Interviews Meg Kabalt

## Intro - 2 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liz Lantz, and I'm a UX designer and researcher working on VA.gov.  YOur product owner, Samara, and product managers, AJ and Heather, are also on the call to listen and learn from you. Our team works on the logged-in experience of VA.gov. Currently, that experience is dedicated to Veterans, and we're starting to think about how we might support non-Veterans accounts on VA.gov. We're here today to learn more about how VHA defines different non-Veteran user types such as dependents, caregivers, delegates, etc so we can find a common understanding across the various parts of the VA.

**Do you have any questions so far?**

**Are you comfortable if I record the audio as we talk today?** I use the recordings to confirm that I have captured everything accurately in my notes. I'll delete the recordings after I synthesis all my notes.

- If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
