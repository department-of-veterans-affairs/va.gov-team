# Conversation Guide for SME Interviews, VBA Pension + Fiduciary

## Intro - 2 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liz Lantz, and I'm a UX designer and researcher working on VA.gov.  Our product owner, Samara, and product managers, AJ and Heather, are also on the call to listen and learn from you. Our team works on the logged-in experience of VA.gov. Currently, that experience is dedicated to Veterans, and we're starting to think about how we might support non-Veterans accounts on VA.gov. We're here today to learn more about how VBA defines different non-Veteran user types such as dependents, caregivers, delegates, etc so we can find a common understanding across the various parts of the VA.

**Do you have any questions so far?**

**Are you comfortable if I record the audio as we talk today?** I use the recordings to confirm that I have captured everything accurately in my notes. I'll delete the recordings after I synthesis all my notes.

- If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Introduction

I know your group works with pension and fiduciaries, but I don't know much beyond that. Can you give me some background information about the work that you do?

I'm aware of the Survivors pension benefit. What other non-Veteran benefits are part of your portfolio?

How do fiduciaries fit in?

## Dependent vs Beneficiary

- Is there a difference between dependents and beneficiaries?
- What qualifies a person as a dependent?
- What qualifies someone as a beneficiary?
- How are those roles different, and the same?
- Do you have to be a dependent to be a beneficiary?

## Fiduciaries and Veteran Advocates

I'd like to learn more about fiduciaries.  How does a Veteran get a fiduciaries?

- Is it something assigned by the VA?
- Do they automatically get delegate access?
- Are there any fiduciaries specific systems or processes we should be aware of as it relates to non-Veteran user roles?
- What tasks would a fiduciary need to do?

- What can you tell me about your work with POAs, CVSOs, VSOs, and claim agents?
- What are the tasks that that person type may need to do?

## Caregivers

How does your work intersect with Caregivers?

## Others

Any other non-Veteran groups within your work you're aware of that we haven't touched in?

## Business Line Priorities

From a VBA pension and fiduciary perspective, what do you think is the most important use case for non-Veterans?

## Next steps and Closing

Is there anyone else you think our team should talk to?

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to explore non-Veteran user roles on VA.gov.
