## Starting the Session | 5 minutes

[Have your camera on]

[If the participant doesn't show up in the first few minutes, reach out to Perigean on Slack.]


- Thank you for joining this session today! I first want to make sure that we're able to hear each other.

[WAIT FOR RESPONSE - if can’t hear, [troubleshoot](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/troubleshooting-for-va-gov-research-sessions-in-pr#Troubleshootingresearchsessions-Problem:Usercannothearyou/youcan'thearthemonZoom) otherwise...]

- Great! I’m [YOUR NAME] and I’m a researcher for VA.gov. 
- I also have [NOTE TAKER NAME] here today to take some notes. I’ll ask them to introduce themself.

[PAUSE FOR NOTE TAKER to introduce themself]

- I'd also love for you to tell us a little about yourself.

[PAUSE FOR PARTICIPANT to introduce themself]

- Nice to meet you!
- We have a couple other team members in the waiting room who would like to observe and help take notes. But before we invite them, I'd like to tell you more about what we're doing today.
- The subject of our research today is the login and account process. We're not testing your ability.
- Today we're going to talk about how you sign in to access and manage your VA benefits and health care.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. The goal is to improve this process to better meet veterans needs. We will not be offended by any opinions you express, and we welcome your candid feedback.
- In this session, later on, I’ll ask you to interact with a prototype. It will look real, but it isn’t, and we won’t be accessing your account or real information. We use prototypes to help us test things before we decide what to make real.
- This entire session will take no more than 1 hour.
- I do want you to be as comfortable as possible, so if for any reason and at any time you want to pause or even stop the session, please let me know.
- Perigean did previously ask for your consent to allow other people to observe today, but I know things can change. So I'd like to confirm with you now - are you okay with a couple of additional observers joining us during this session?
   - [If NO]: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - [If YES]: Admit observers.
      - Let’s have each of our observers quickly go around and introduce themselves with cameras on, please. 
      - [PAUSE for observers to introduce themselves]
      - Ok and now I’ll ask our notetakers and observers to mute themselves and turn off their cameras for the remainder of the sessions to save on distractions and to save Zoom bandwidth.
- I want to ask your permission for another item now. We do like to record these sessions. This helps us so we can look back for clarifications like to make sure we noted your opinions correctly. We delete recordings after we finish analysis, which usually takes a couple weeks. Also we sometimes write quotes down to help others at the VA understand why we want to make certain changes, but your name will not be directly linked to any of your comments.
- Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and our audio as we talk today?
   - [IF YES - RECORD TO CLOUD] 
   - Now that we're recording, I have to confirm once more - are you are ok if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- [WAIT FOR RESPONSE]
- Ok, that's it for set up! Do you have any questions before we get started?


## Round 1: Mobile internet use questions | 5 minutes

I'd like to start with a few questions to get to know how you go online…

- Can you tell me about how you normally go online?
   - [PROMPT] Do you regularly use a mobile phone to go online?
   - [PROMPT] Do you regularly use a tablet to go online?
   - [IF APPLICABLE] Do you happen to know the brand or model of your phone [and/or tablet]
- Between a phone, tablet, or computer, which would you say you use the most to go online?
   - Could you tell me about why you tend to use [THAT DEVICE] the most?
- How often would you say you access a bank account from your phone?
   - [IF ANY] When accessing a bank account, do you have a prefence of doing that either from a phone or on a computer?
- Can you tell me about a time when you created a new account for a site from your phone?
   - [PROMPT] Did you find any issues or difficulties when doing that?
   - [IF NEVER] Is that something you would consider doing from a phone?
      - Could you tell me more about that?
- For an account you already have, let’s say that you need to update the phone number or password for that. Can you tell me about a time that you've done that from your phone?
   - [PROMPT] That could be either on the VA or another website
   - [IF DOESN'T] Could you tell me a little more about why you don't use a phone for that?


## Round 2: Account terms questions | 10 minutes

I’d like to take some time to think about a few words or phrases that the VA or a bank website might use when talking about online accounts. I want to remind you that this isn’t a test of you or your vocabulary. Instead we're interested in understanding what you and other veterans call things so we can make instructions more clear and understandable.

- I'm going to set up a scenario here. Let's say that you need to access your bank online [IF THEY PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED ONLINE BANKING, otherwise use “the VA”]. Before they will show your information, they have you type in your username, which is often your email address, and password. What might you call that process?
- Now a bank might require you to put in your username and password, and then after that they might text you a 6-digit number that they need back from you.
   - Can you tell me about an experience you've had with something like that?
   - Do you have a word or phrase you might call that?
   - Do you consider the 6-digit number to be part of signing in? Or is it different?
      - Can you tell me a bit more about your thoughts on this?
- Now let's think about the process of creating an account. A site like a bank or health care organization that has important and private personal information about you might ask you to prove who you are. For example, they might have you answer questions about your credit history, or where you’ve lived in the past. Some sites might ask you to send a picture of your ID. Can you tell me about a time that you've done this while creating an account?
   - Do you have a word or phrase you might call this process?
- Imagine that a bank [OR the VA] wanted people to set up a new way to sign in that would be more secure than how they currently sign in.
   - If you were working for the [BANK or VA] and trying to tell someone about this new type of sign in, how might you describe it?
   - [PROMPT] Would you think of this as an upgraded account?
- Let’s switch it up a little. I’d like for you to think about two specific words. “Authenticate” and “verify”. What similarities or differences do you think about with these two words?
   - [PROMPT] Do they mean different things to you? Or would you use them to talk about the same kind of thing?
- Are there any terms you've seen or heard when talking about signing in or creating an account that you often find confusing or a bad fit?

### Things to watch for:
- How the participant thinks about these terms
- Are there any nuances?
- Is there any confusion?

## Round 3: VA account use questions | 10 minutes

Let’s think more specifically about accessing the VA online

- Why do you tend to sign into the VA online?
- How often would you say that you go online to manage your VA benefits or VA healthcare using your phone?
   - [IF SPLIT mobile/computer] 
   - Are there certain things you are more likely to do with the VA online using a phone?
   - Are there things you’re more likely to do on a computer?
      - [either desktop or laptop]
- If I asked you to use your phone to sign into your VA account online, how would you get there?
   - [PROMPT: maybe MHV? Or VA.gov? Or eBenefits? Or the VA phone app?]
   - Is [ANOTHER VA PORTAL] a place you visit?
      - Do you ever sign in there?
   - [IF NOT ALREADY MENTIONED] Do you ever use the VA smart phone app?
      - [IF YES] When you go to the VA online while on your mobile phone, would you say you tend to use the VA app more or the web version more?
   - I’m interested in why you [DO or DON’T] go to different places for the VA online.
   - Is there a word or phrase that you might use to call all these different VA places online?
      - [NOTE: DON’T say “VA digital tools” or "VA online tools" here, save further discussion about this in Round 4]
- When was the last time you remember signing into your [VA account online], either with a phone, tablet, or computer?
   - And are you comfortable telling me why you signed in that day? Like what were you trying to do then?
   - Do you remember what webpage or web address you used at that time?
      - [PROMPT: maybe VA.gov or maybe My HealtheVet (myhealth.va.gov) or the VA app?]
   - How did you sign in to the VA that time?
      - [PROMPT or screen share for MHV - there are 3 options…]
      - [PROMPT or screen share for VA.gov - there are 4 options…]
   - Do you remember why you started signing in with that option?
      - Do you remember if you got any help creating that sign in option?
- [IF recent sign in was into the MHV site]
   - Are there times when you go to VA.gov to sign into your account?
   - [IF YES] Which of the sign in choices would you say use most often
      - [PROMPT or screen share DS login, My HealtheVet login, Login.gov, or ID.me]
   - Do you ever use another option?
      - [IF YES] Can you tell me about when you would choose to log in this way?
- [IF USES MULTIPLE PORTALS] Do you use the same sign in option for VA.gov, MHV, and eBenefits?
- Is there anything else you want to share with me about signing into your VA account online, before we move on?


## Round 4: Modal task | 10 minutes

I’d like for us to now take a look at a prototype. This is a website design that we're thinking about using. It will look like VA.gov but this is not real, and everything might not work like you are used to. Your thoughts and ideas about this will help us know how we can make it better.

I’m going to sign into this Zoom call from my phone, so I can share the design as you might see it from a phone. It'll look like another person is joining this session, but it’s just me. Is that ok? [IF NO - share from desktop... ok instead of that, I'll share my desktop screen]

Ok give me a few moments to get set up.

[IF DOESN'T use VA.gov or the MHV/DSL CSPs, then... while I spend a few moments to set this up, I'd like for you to prepare yourself to pretend like you do go to VA.gov and that you use the DSLogin option to sign in.]

[JOIN ZOOM session from phone - be logged out of zoom on your phone]

[Select "Join Meeting", enter Zoom meeting ID, join without audio, Share > Website URL ([the prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/8vobVoSl1UqLnXsni3rcvO/Login.gov-Adoption%3A-Design-Flows?node-id=1375-5590&scaling=scale-down&page-id=944%3A3979))]

[IF ANY ISSUE WITH PHONE SHARE - screen share the mobile design from computer]

---
- This should look like what you'd see on VA.gov from your phone - does it look familiar?
- I'm going to move through a couple pages. I want you to feel free to guide or direct me where to go on the page
- Let's say you were going to sign into your account to [PRIOR MENTIONED TASK or “refill a prescription”].
   - Would you normally select the "sign in" button?
   - [ADAVANCE to the sign in options page]
   - Ok and then which option would you select here?
   - [IF Login.gov or ID.me - ok I understand that's how you'd sign in. Today let's pretend that you're a veteran who uses the DSLogin option. Are you ok with that?]
   - Before we move on, when I select the sign in option we'll skip the part where we actually put in a username and password and we'll move right to the next page.
      - What would you expect to see just after the sign in page?
   - Also I'll warn you that I'll only leave the next page up breifly. It can be jarring when I hide it, but it's a technique that helps us get your first impression. I want to remind you that we aren't testing you, but we can understand how well the page works by the first impression it leaves on you.
   - Ok, so if we're ready to go... [BRIEF PAUSE]
   - ...let's pretend that you're putting in your username and password for [DSLogin OR MHV]. 
   - [ADVANCE to modal]
- So now you're signed in. Can you start to describe for me what you see or what you might do here?
   - [STOP SCREEN SHARE AFTER 15-20 seconds, usually about when they start to answer the above question]
   - [NOTE if cognative disability/decline or participant seems more slow and methodical, leave up for 5 or more additional seconds]
   - How did the page you saw compare to what you expected?
   - If you saw that pop up while you were actually signing in, what would you do next?
      - [PROMPT: maybe close it right away? Or read through it?]
   - It was really quick, but could you tell me about anything on the last screen that stood out to you?
      - [PROMPT - what words do you remember from that quick look?] 
   - Do any other questions or thoughts immediately come to your mind? 
      - If none, that's fine too
- Would you expect anything to happen if you ignore this particular popup?
   - [PROMPT] could you miss out on something? Would you get more notifications about this if it’s important? Would those notifications come in different places?
   - Have you gotten a popup before, right as you log into your account - either VA or another site?
      - How closely do you usually read a pop up like this?
      - Do you generally ignore those?
      - What if it shows up again the next time you sign in?
         - If that's happened in the past, did you still ignore it?
     - Other than right as you sign in, would there be a better place or time for this to come up for you?
        - Why would this be a point for you to see this?
- I’ll give you some time to look through this now. Try to spend as much time as you would if you were actually signing into your account here. Let me know when you are good.
   - [IF WOULD CLOSE IMMEDIATELY - imagine that something about this caught your eye and you were intested in learning more. Spend a few moments to read through this page]

[FROM PHONE - Zoom > Share > Website URL - the URL should be saved if the phone never left the session]

[WAIT AS NEEDED]

- Do any questions come to your mind now that you’ve looked through it a little more?
- There are a few terms on this page that I'd like to think more about
   - What does the word "upgrade" at the top make you think about?
   - The first paragraph uses the phrase "other VA online tools," what is your understanding of what that might mean?
      - If this instead said "VA Applications" would that change your understanding here?
      - What about if it said "for signing into the VA online"?
   - Where it says "here's what you'll need" - walk me through your thoughts about this part
     - [PROMPT] What do you think about with State ID?
  - At the bottom, where it says "no thanks remind me later" what would you expect that to do?
     - [PROMPT] Would it close out this popup?
- If you were describing this information to a friend or family member, what would you tell them this page means?
- How do you feel about the information that's presented on this screen?
   - How do you feel about the option listed?
   - Have you heard of it?
   - Does this make you to think about the way you sign in?
   - Let's say that you decide to register for Login.gov. What would you're expectations be for the next time you sign in to see your VA information?
      - [PROMPT] Where would you go to sign in?
      - [PROMPT] What method would you choose to sign in?
      - [PROMPT] Would you expect all the information you want to see online with VA remain the same?
- If instead of showing one sign in option here, if instead we said something like “The VA has two options that meet our security standards” and showed you both choices, what would you think?
   - How would you choose which to go with?
- Do you have any questions for me about this screen?
- [IF HAVENT DISCUSSED - Whe you sign in to VA.gov, which of the 4 ways of signing in do you recognize?]
- Do you have any questions about any of these questions or tasks that we’ve worked through today?

### Things to watch for:
- Is the participant compelled to leave their legacy credential?
- Is there confusion around any terms?
- Are there any nuances?
- Is there any confusion?


## Thank-You and Closing | 5 minutes

[CHECK if any question's were left in slack, if none then...]

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on VA.gov to make sure it works for Veterans.

Lastly, Perigean is who set up the scheduling with you - they will get you set up with the thank you stipend. They will also send you information that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to give them the chance to participate in future research.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Session Helps
### Instructions for finding Zoom chat (if needed)
- In the Zoom application on your phone or computer, you'll see a row of buttons at the bottom. 
  - Computer: Just to the left of center is a conversation bubble that says **Chat**. 
    - *If don't see chat, ASK:* Do you see the red **Stop Share** button? If so, put your mouse just above it and see if you see more Zoom controls. Then click on the **Chat** button in the center of the Zoom controls.
  - Phone: On the far right is a **More** button or **3 dots**. Tap that and then on Chat or the conversation bubble. 
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.

---

### Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]

- I really appreciate you taking some time with us today. I have now covered all the questions we have for you. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.

OR
- I am so sorry, but the prototype we wanted to test with you today is having a glitch and we aren’t going to be able to use that. Unfortunately, we’ll need to end the session. I apologize for that, but I appreciate your willingness to help us on this.
