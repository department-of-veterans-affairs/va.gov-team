## Background

To date, the only direct observational study of users’ end-to-end experience with the unsupervised flow focused on the experience of users with low vision or blindness ([Low Vision and Blind Users - Usability Testing Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X9dPQaI5xtCNYOD3nnBIygiFh6DBfE7zThNXiXpKeKU/edit?urp=gmail_link)). Login.gov researchers have proposed direct observational research of a broader user base in the past, including [Research plan - IdV Usability Testing with Agency Partners](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1MBZRCrYfir2T2d5NX_Hqr4vXsnvyrYq0gaVpSyo_lkY/edit?urp=gmail_link). At the time, the study did not move forward due to challenges with recruiting and resourcing due to COVID
restrictions.

Our team proposes a direct observational study with a broad user base so that we can
better understand the issues users are having with the unsupervised flow.
Understanding those needs will help the remote supervised teams diagnose issues and
design better solutions. We also expect other teams to benefit from this research.

### OCTO Objectives 
>Which [OCTO objectives] (https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

6. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

- Veterans can manage their account to a consolidated login
- Veterans can decide the best CSP for their needs
- Veterans and their families can apply for all benefits online
- Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information

_All of the above are dependent on an easy and secure sign-in experience_

### Veteran Journey
>Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)?<br>Are there moments that matter?

Our product fits in at the start of the Veteran Journey from Serving in the Military through Getting Out and Starting Up.  However, it additionally serves the Veteran throughout their journey because they may receive VA services throughout their life.

Starting Up
- Finding something to do
- Re-establishing and creating relationships
- Attending to health needs


Our product fits into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) at the Starting Up of myself Life Stage. At this moment a veteran is looking to find help and support for their health.

Taking care of self
- Managing primary care and chronic health issues
- Maintaining my health
- Seeking support for an acute health event

## Research Goals	

Develop baseline understanding of how users experience Login.gov’s end-to-end unsupervised proofing flow, including what challenges they face and how they seek to
overcome them.

### Outcome

This research will inform UX and product strategy across the following sprint teams:

* Remote Supervised
    * MVP scoping: Where can an MVP Remote Supervised video chat solution be most helpful? (e.g. live video chat technical assistance, alternative biometric check if KYC fails)

* Customer Experience
    * Team to write
* Team Ada
    * Team to write

* Team Katherine

    * Team to write

### Research questions

1. Why do users drop off from Login.gov’s unsupervised flow? 
2. What are their primary blockers, challenges, or frustrations?
3. What types of help, assistance, and/or offramps would help users successfully
complete identity verification?
    1. Where can an MVP Remote Supervised video chat solution be most
helpful in unblocking users so they can continue with the flow? (e.g. live video chat technical assistance)
    2. Are there cognitive challenges that users have when going through a remote supervised identity proofing experience (e.g. emotional states)?
    3. What languages and/or accommodations need to be supported for a remote supervised flow?

### Hypothesis
What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.
- What do you already know about this problem space?
- What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don’t skip this step!)
- Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study. 
- Remember to constrain the hypothesis to the goals of your study!

## Methodology

1-hour remote direct observation studies with potential Login.gov users who have not yet started the identity proofing process.

Study participants will go through the actual process of setting up an account and identity proofing through a Login.gov staging environment using actual attributes and identity documents. This will allow us to observe as close to a “real”/actual user experience as possible. It also poses privacy considerations, which we have outlined mitigations for below.


### Location

Reserach sessions will be held remotely via Zoom.

## Recruitment	


### Recruitment approach

* USDS will partner with agencies and non-profit organizations to share the research opportunity with their communities (e.g. SSA, American Association for People with Disabilities)
* Potential participants will express interest via a Survey Monkey sign-up sheet
* We will take an iterative approach to the study and start by scheduling 12 participants.
* From there, we will assess recruiting needs for the second half of the studies. For
example, it’s possible that we may have reached saturation of the common themes and problems after observing 12 participants, or that we may want to
recruit additional participants and continue the study.

### Recruitment criteria


**Primary criteria (must-haves)**

Our goal is to recruit 24 participants in order to observe a wide range of experiences across users and agencies. We want to have a broad sampling of participants. Below are the demographic breakdowns we are aiming for:

* Gender (even distribution)
    * Man, transgender, non-binary, or intersex
    * Woman, transgender, non-binary, or intersex
    * Transgender, non-binary, or intersex
    
* Race/ethnicity
    * 66% People of color
    * 33% White, Non-hispanic
    
* Age (even distribution)
    * 18-29
    * 30-44
    * 45-65
    * 65+
    
* Low vision/no vision

* Screen readers 
    * (iOS, Jaws, Text to Voice)

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**

* Income (even distribution)
    * Under 20K
    * 20-39K
    * 40-59K
    * 60-79K
    * 80-100K
    
* Education
    *  Highschool Diploma
    *  Associates Degree
    *  Bachelors Degree
    *  Masters Degree    

## Timeline


### Prepare

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session.
