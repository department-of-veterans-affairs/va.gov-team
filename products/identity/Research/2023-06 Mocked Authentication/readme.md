Mocked Authentication is an alternate authentication flow on local and development builds of VA.gov, which allows users to test and develop downstream features without the need to authenticate with a real credential provider. Users are able to select the test account they'd like to authenticate as, without the need for a user name or password.

The goals of this research are to
- Test the usability of the current Mocked Authentication product
- Find solutions for the current known issues around error messages
- Develop product backlog
