# Research Plan for Core Identity, Mocked Authentication, Usability Testing

## Background

Mocked Authentication is an alternate authentication flow on local and development builds of VA.gov, which allows users to test and develop downstream features without the need to authenticate with a real credential provider. Users are able to select the test account they'd like to authenticate as, without the need for a user name or password.

## Research Goals

- Test the usability of the [current Mocked Authentication product](https://dev.va.gov/sign-in/mocked-auth)
- Find solutions for the current known issues around error messages
- Develop product backlog


### Research questions

- What changes should be made before broad use of this product?
- What changes can be put in the backlog for a possible future iteration?


## Methodology

Remote usability testing will evaluate the prototype with participants who are engineers on VA.gov.

## Recruitment

We will recruit 3-4 VFS developers from other teams. We’ll first check with a couple developers that Joe and Trevor recommend, who might be interested. We’ll direct message them in slack with:
> Hi [NAME]! The Identity Core team is working on gathering information to better understand and improve the Mock Authentication experience. We are looking for developers to participate in a short usability test.
>
> Joe and Trevor from the team recommended that we reach out to you. Sessions will be about 30-45 minutes. Would you be willing to set aside some time to test with us?

If we don’t reach 3 participants, we’ll post a message in DSVA slack channel #general and cross post in #accountexp-authexp and #vsp-identity. The slack message we’ll use:

>Looking for developer input
>
>The Identity Core team is working on gathering information to better understand and improve the Mock Authentication experience.
