## Research Goals

VA would like all users utilizing the authenticated experience on VA.gov and across its surrounding sites and services to be presented with a unified version of the terms and conditions. These terms of use should be able to track acceptance on a user-by-user basis, including when revisions are made to the terms and conditions and updates are presented to the user.

With the research on this new terms of use page, we wanted to: 
- Explore veterans thinking around terms of use as a general concept and as it relates to the VA.gov website specifically.
- Understand how being presented with a terms of use page might be disruptive to the Veteran’s sign in experience.
- Test the usability of a prototype for updated terms of use, specifically considering the use of accordions, the use of button language, and if folks can move past the terms of use.


## Research Questions

1.  Does the prototype allow users to successfully understand the updated terms of use?
2.  Are folks able to successfully complete this page in order to move onto the authenticated experience?
3. Is there a substantial usability difference between certain language and design options?
4. What changes would make the prototype more helpful or more usable?

## Methodology 

We combined several methodologies for this test. We conduct interview discussions to evaluate how veterans felt about terms of use in general and specifically for VA. We tested prototypes tailored to the mobile, desktop and screen reader experiences to ensure that participants were able to read through sections of the terms of use they were most interested in and move past the terms of use page when they were ready. Finally, as part of the usability testing we included a modified multivariate test to look at the language of the two buttons that move a user past this page.

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

1. Veterans will be familiar with terms of use from other sites and apps.
   - **Definitely True** - We spoke with a range of folks of varying ages and to those using various technologies to access the web; everyone has seen terms of use many times on other websites and expected that the VA will have a terms of use as well. 
2. Veterans will see needing to agree to an updated terms with VA as a nuisance.
   - **Partially True** - The words “nuisance,” “aggravating,” or “annoying” were used by several participants, unprompted. However, most just see terms of use as a largely necessary thing, whether or not they expressed their displeasure with it or viewed it in a negative way. Additionally, a couple participants did discuss how they liked knowing a terms of use is there, and especially to what extent it protects a user of a given site.
3. Veterans will opt to click past this as quickly as possible by not reading any long paragraphs, so they can move on to their task at hand.
   - **Mostly True** - Most participants expressed they move past terms of use on other sites as quickly as possible and only put in the minimum effort - like scrolling through the entire terms when forced or clicking to accept but not actually reading. A couple participants did say they prefer to either skim or read at least some sections of a terms of use. Some of those who would read or skim, expressed they had decreased need to read terms of use on a government site, since they had confidence that the entity wouldn’t be able to use their information in a nefarious way - meaning they might be even less likely to read the terms of use from the VA as compared to a private site.

## Key Findings

1. Terms of Use is a widely accepted practice, and veterans expect to see them.
   - Folks have a well-established mental model with terms of use
2. Most veterans move past (i.e. accept) terms of use as quickly as possible and without reading them.
   - Some folks will be interested in a particular section of the terms of use and may skim or read a portion of that section
3. Terms of use can be seen as positive if the user has a positive relationship with the service and if the terms include protections for the user
4. Veterans rarely decline a service’s terms of use, but when they do the consequences are clear.
5. Accordion functionality on terms of use and our prototype’s button language both resonate with veterans.
6. Parts of our prototype terms of use page were validated in usability testing, but some modifications could make this prototype terms of use more usable.


## Details of Findings 

**1. Terms of use is a widely accepted practice, and veterans expect to see them**

Labels: `Accessibility`, `AUD: Veterans`, `HDW: Desktop`, `HDW: Laptop`, `HDW: Smartphone`, `PRDT: Login`, `RESRCH: Evaluative`, `RESRCH: Interviews`, `RESRCH: Remote`

- Related to: Hypothesis 1, Question 1, Question 2

Participants, including those of various ages, were all experienced seeing terms of use. Most reported seeing them regularly from various services. In fact, many had seen one within a couple of days of our research session. They are ubiquitous.
Since they are so widely used and seen on other services, it’s best that the VA largely follow the well-established mental model around terms of use. 
Participants largely see them presented at sign in, and some also recalled updated notification in email. Users assume they will be required to accept or agree to the terms of use before they can move on to using the desired service.

>_"[They are] rules that the owner of the website has for you to use the functionality" - Participant 17_


**2. Most veterans move past (i.e. accept) terms of use as quickly as possible and without reading them**

Labels: `Accessibility`, `AUD: Veterans`, `DSC: Accordions`, `HDW: Desktop`, `HDW: Laptop`, `HDW: Smartphone`, `PRDT: Content`, `PRDT: Login`, `RESRCH: Evaluative`, `RESRCH: Interviews`, `RESRCH: Remote`, `RESRCH: Usability`

- Related to: Hypothesis 2, Question 3

Most of the folks we talked with try to move past a service’s terms of use as quickly as possible. They don’t read or skim the terms of use, but proceed to the part of the page where they can acknowledge they accept or agree to the terms of use. Folks do this in order to continue on with their task at hand as quickly as possible.
However, a couple participants were interested in a particular section of a terms of use, particularly how information is used and shared. Those participants may be more likely to skim or even read the given section of interest.

>_"My assumption is that all of them are the same, and I just click through it" - Participant 11_

>_"I would look through a terms of use if there was a mechanism to force me to look at it." - Participant 16_


**3. Terms of use can be seen as positive if the user has a positive relationship with the service and the terms include protections for the user**

- Related to: Hypothesis 2

Most veterans feel resigned to the fact that they must accept a terms of use, and are likely to consider them a sort of necessary evil. Even so, veterans can have positive feelings with terms of use. Positive feelings are most likely to be found with folks who generally consider the VA in a positive way and who also feel that the terms of use offers protections for them as a user. Positive feelings can include increased trust in the VA or general peace of mind about accepting a terms of use for VA. 
Those who consider the VA in a negative way or who feel that terms of use generally take advantage of the users will feel more neutral or negative towards seeing VA’s terms of use.

>_"[Terms of use] increases my trust with the VA" - Participant 17_


**4. Veterans rarely decline a terms of use, but when they do the consequences are clear**

Labels: `Accessibility`, `AUD: Veterans`, `HDW: Desktop`, `HDW: Laptop`, `HDW: Smartphone`, `PRDT: Content`, `PRDT: Login`, `RESRCH: Evaluative`, `RESRCH: Interviews`, `RESRCH: Remote`, `RESRCH: Usability`

- Related to: Hypothesis 1, Hypothesis 3

Only two of our participants could think of a specific time when they declined a terms of use in the past, and a third had decided not to use a social media service because they had concerns about its terms of use based on news stories. Most of the folks we talked with have either never declined or couldn’t recall a time when they had declined a service’s terms of use.
Our participants understood that in order to use a service, you need to agree to the terms of use. In another view they understood the consequences that they can't use a service or app if they don't accept the terms of use. This caused some to feel forced to into accepting a site's terms of use. Still, all participants felt it was reasonable for the VA to block someone from signing in online if they don’t agree to the terms of use.
The prototype terms of use page reinforced this convention, and the warning alert titled “What will happen if you decline” caught the attention of most participants. Noone was surprised by this information, although they felt it would be detrimental to anyone who didn’t accept.

>_“If you decline.... I expect I won't be able to use the app” - Participant 16_

>_"What will happen if you decline? Oh no s***. I can't access the website" - Participant 14_


**5. Accordion functionality on terms of use and our prototype’s button language both resonate with veterans**

Labels: `Accessibility`, `AUD: Veterans`, `DSC: Accordions`, `HDW: Desktop`, `HDW: Laptop`, `HDW: Smartphone`, `PRDT: Content`, `PRDT: Login`, `RESRCH: Evaluative`, `RESRCH: Interviews`, `RESRCH: Remote`, `RESRCH: Usability`

- Related to: Hypothesis 1, Question 1, Question 2, Question 3, Question 4

Usability testing validated the use of **accordions** on the terms of use page. All participants, including older, cognitive disability, and assistive technology users, understood the accordions and that more information could be pulled out. While most would not select to open them or read the content, they did all understand the functionality. Since the accordions begin in a collapsed state, veterans who prefer to skip through terms of use can scroll down to the accept button quicker than if the entire content showed. Also folks who are interested in just one section can find it easier and expand it without scrolling through the entire content.

>_"[The accordions] don't compel me to click on them. I know I should expand them, the plus mark" - Participant 18_

>_“I might click on these [accordions] if I was interested in reading more" - Participant 17_

We found that all veterans understood the **button language** of this prototype (ie. “accept” and “decline”). All participants defined accept and decline similarly to our use in the prototype. We found a slight preference for a single word on these buttons - so “decline” felt easier to read or understand over “don’t accept.” To the degree folks had preference between “agree” and “accept,” more felt that ”accept” as the label here resonated more. Finally, while some folks did like the simplicity of using “yes/no” on the buttons, others felt it lost proper context.


>_"[The button] looks neater with just the single word" - Participant 9_

>_“ ‘Decline’ is easier than ‘not accept’ to me." - Participant 15_

Related to the buttons, we found that **the flow** to the next page made sense for folks. Veterans expected to end up on either the home page or their MyVA page after agreeing, depending where they sign in. This tracks with what happens currently after signing in on VA.gov, and what we’re planning for when the terms of use update is live. We also found that the decline page, the page veterans saw after declining the terms of use, offered the necessary information while being brief and easy to understand.

>_“[The accept button would] redirect me to the home page or my account” - Participant 20_

**6. Parts of our prototype terms of use page were validated in usability testing, but some modifications could make this prototype terms of use more usable**

- Related to: Question 4

Our testing found some other items that are worth consideration. The bulk of these are related to other teams, so this report will include those in [Additional Insights and Recommendations](#additional-insights-and-recommendations). 

Insights related to the front end design include making sure it is as easy as possible for folks to move past the terms of use page. Especially on mobile, getting to the buttons at the bottom takes quite a bit of scrolling. 

Everyone easily found the PDF of the terms of use; however, there wasn’t interest in downloading it, especially if it could be found on the VA.gov site later on, which is the plan. We might be giving too much prominence to the PDF download here. Finally, most services present terms of use on a either modal or a page that isn’t a normal site templated page that all the navigation options. This means this will be the mental model that folks are used to. In accordance with UX best practice and previous Identity Team research, modals should be used sparingly since they interrupt; however, in this case, it’s interrupting by design and does require a user’s input. As designed, our prototype is a site temaple page, which includes the standard VA header navigation that someone could use to move off the terms of use page before they accept it.

> "I would never download this" - Participant 18

## Recommendations
Note: This section is specifically for our design and front end related recommendations. We have included additional Content CAIA Team, Office of General Council, and Platform Design System Team findings and recommendations in [Additional Insights and Recommendations](#additional-insights-and-recommendations)

1. Ensure the buttons to move past the terms of use are easy to find
   - Key Finding 2 - most folks want to move past terms of use as quickly as possible
   - Key Finding 6 - parts of our prototype could be modified to make it more usable
2. Continue to utilize accordions, and keep the full terms of use content collapsed by default
   - Key Finding 2 - we should make terms of use as easy as possible to move past
   - Key Finding 2 - folks who are interested in a section of the terms of use can easily open up that accordion to read more
   - Key Finding 6 - accordions use on this page resonates with folks
3. Ensure headings are clear 
   - Key Finding 6 - the top H1 heading and the first H2 heading seemed to overlap. One of the H3 accordion headers was “Feedback” and folks weren’t sure what that referred to. Note: the prototype didn't test final language here
4. The PDF download doesn’t have to be prominent on the page, especially if the content can be easily found later on
   - Key Finding 6 - The PDF on the terms of use page was easy to find but not of interest
5. Add a warning when selecting "decline" button about being signed out, prior to being signed out.
   - Key Finding 6 - if someone accidentally selects decline, they’d need to sign back in to accept the terms of use, which for some veterans, especially assistive technology users can take a significant amount of time.
   - It also came up that implementing a warning might be warning overkill, so it'll still be worth testing further
6. For future terms of use updates, consider using a modal or another way to present instead of on a full page with the standard VA header and navigation. For example a modal or a full page without standard site navigation are more standard presentations for terms of use.
   - Key Finding 6 - some folks thought the presentation of terms of use prototype was strange, and it may be because they are used to seeing other services display terms of use not on a standard site page
   - A modal or a page without standard navigation could easily be used to stop people from navigating off page before they’ve accepted it
   - 2023-04 Proactive CSP Migration, Key Finding 1 - modals are disruptive; however, in this case user input is required and compliance is compulsory before moving on, so this could warrant an interrupting modal


## Additional Insights and Recommendations

**Finding and recommendations related to the Platform design system team and/or the VA Design System**

1. A screen magnification user felt the paragraph and heading level 3 text was too small even at 5 times zoom
   - Recommendation: Design system team and/or CAIA accessibility teams could test this more extensively with a group of screen magnifiation users if this presents a new concern.
2. Accordions played well for use on terms of use page
   - Recommendation: This design component has proven itself with broad understanding for this use, this research is tagged so will show up with other research on accordions. See also [the design system page on accordions](https://design.va.gov/components/accordion)


**Finding and recommendations related to the Office of General Council and CAIA Content team**

1. Most folks probably won’t pay attention to the VA terms of use text, since they don’t normally read terms of use, and generally move past them quickly as possible
2. Many participants feel forced to accept terms of use, so they prefer it also includes some user protections. If those are called out they'll be easier to find.
   - Recommendation: Terms of use should have value to the user, things like data security and not selling data.
   - Recommendation: At the top, bullet or otherwise highlight the value to users. Consider including a section titled something like “protections for users”
3. Terms of use might affect user trust in a positive way IF the user already has a positive view of VA AND they feel like the terms of use is fair and not predatory.
   - Recommendation: similar to 2, make sure terms of use protects the user as well, and make sure the VA is being reasonable on the protections it’s carving out for itself.
4. Our set of participants understood the negative consequences of not accepting a terms of use, and understood that reduced access would be one of those, whether on a private or government site
   - Recommendation: We should feel more comfortable about restricting access based on accepting the terms of use; however, restricting access to the VA online services can be seen as devastating to veterans. Therefore, also understand there will likely still be highly upset outliers who don’t want to accept and also don’t want to lose online access.
5. Should a user decline, they wouldn't want to be cut off immediately since they feel like their health data is theirs and access is important for their medical needs
   - Recommendation: If possible, allow some amount of time (like 24 hours) for the user to download important documents before being signed out by declining to the terms of use
6. On this and future terms of use updates, folks want to see just the changes, not the whole terms of use again. They have no frame of reference for what was changed if they see the whole thing without changes being called out in some way.
   - Recommendation: Future terms of use updates, should bullet or otherwise summarize the changes front and center, with either a link to or then the entire text of the new terms of use next on the page
      - A benefit here is more folks might be more likely to read more of it, if it’s super short with just a couple of changes.
7. Veterans want to be able to access terms of use on the site after accepting, but none of our participants were into downloading the PDF of it and have never downloaded one in the past, leading us to believe it's not part of their mental model for terms of use.
   - Recommendation: Make sure terms of use can be found on site by either search or browse - don’t include accept/decline buttons on that page
8. Some participants mentioned the desire to be able to approve certain parts of the terms of use in order to access only certain parts of the site
   - Recommendation: While it’s something that happens with online cookies, it’s not necessarily part of the mental model for terms of use at this point. Also since it would likely require more engineering time than we have with our current deadline, we don’t recommend moving forward with this.

Findings with a content focus:
1. Folks took to the accordions and seemed to like having the ability to read more about a topic where a header caught their eye (keeping in mind that most people will skim or skip entirely).
   a. Recommendation: leave accordions on page, and begin in a closed state
2. The warning alert box for “what will happen if you decline” was found to be helpful
   a. Recommendation: Keep this feature on page
3. VA terms of use decline page was clear and met expectations (caveat - with folks who wouldn’t normally decline a terms of use)
   a. Recommendation: Keep the decline page short and easy to understand.
4. Button wording elicited no strong feelings, but both our current use of accept/decline as well as the option agree/disagree were well understood, and participants gravitated toward using one word on the negative answer button
   a. Recommendation: Continue forward with the current accept/decline, or use agree/disagree as an alternative.
   b. Recommendation: Don't use "don't accept" since a single word on the button resonated slightly more with folks
   v. Recommendation: Don't use yes/no as the button text, since that lost context for some of our participants
6. The H1 and first H2 include "terms of use" and at least one participant found this confusing
   a. Recommendation: Consider if there is a way to reword one of those headers to increase the clarity between them
7. The PDF on the terms of use was easy to find, but not of interest. None of our participants had ever downloaded one in the past, leading us to believe it's not part of their mental model for terms of use.
   a. Recommendation: The PDF download doesn’t have to be prominent on the page, or even necesarily on the page at all, especially if the terms of use can be easily found on the site later on


## Further research needed

On future terms of use updates, we could consider and further research implementing the following options:
1. presenting terms of use content either in a modal, on a page without the VA standard header and navigation, or some way other than a full standard templated page 
2. offering an additional warning on selecting “decline” before being signed out
