# Research Plan for [Identity, Terms of Use, Date]
*Questions about how to set up your research study? Reach out in the #research-ops Slack channel.* 

## Background
VA would like everyone utilizing VA.gov and it's surrounding sites and services to be presented with a unified version of the Terms and Conditions that they will have to agree to in order to continue utilizing the authenticated experience
- [product info](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity/terms%20and%20conditions)


### OCTO Objectives 

- Veterans and their families can apply for all benefits online
- Veterans can manage their health services online
- Veterans and their families trust the security, accuracy, and relevancy of VA.gov


### Veteran Journey

Securely accessing VA online services can happen at any stage in the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf). The updated Terms of Use will apply to every who signs into VA online and uses the authenticated experience.

## Research Goals	

- Test the usability of a prototype that requires veterans to agree to updated terms of use
- Identify any pain points with the prototype
- Validate certain options we are considering for this design on language and certain design elements

### Outcome

- Validate the prototype’s usability.
- Learn what pain points the current design has with various audiences - especially since this page will be a precursor to continuing to use the authenticated experience, we need the design to be as smooth and usable as possible to the everyone


### Research questions

- Does the prototype allow users to successfully understand the updated Terms of Use?
- Are folks able to successfully complete this page in order to move onto the authenticated experience?
- Is there a substantial usability difference between certain language and design options?
- What changes would make the prototype more helpful or more usable?


### Hypothesis

- Veterans will see needing to agree to updated terms as a nuisance
- Veterans will opt to click past this as quickly as possible, including by not reading any long paragraphs of updated terms, so they can move on to their task at hand.


## Methodology	

Remote usability testing will evaluate the prototype with participants. We’ll use Perigean’s Zoom account for these remote sessions. We plan to test with both mobile and desktop users and with assistive tech users.

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach

We will use Perigean to recruit Veterans for this moderated study. We are looking to include as participants some historically under represented groups for this:

- Assistive Tech users (screen zoom, and screen reader in particular)
- mobile users
- cognitive disabilities

### Recruitment criteria

15 Veterans for at least 12 completed sessions


**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
All participants:
Must have a computer or mobile phone and be willing to complete their sessions on this device
Must be willing to share a web browser window on the Zoom call
Must have a working microphone
Must have Zoom downloaded to their computer prior to the session and know how to share their screen
In addition our primary product criteria includes:
Must be Veterans
Must have signed into VA.gov in the last 6 months, for any reason


Our primary diversity and inclusion criteria:
- tbd # of mobile users
- tbd # of cognitive disabilities
- tbd # of screen reader users
- tbd # of of keyboard navigators

### Screener Questions

1. 

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research: Mid-August

### Length of sessions
* Session length: (e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)
* Buffer time between sessions: 1 hour
* Maximum Sessions per day: 4

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 

Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
