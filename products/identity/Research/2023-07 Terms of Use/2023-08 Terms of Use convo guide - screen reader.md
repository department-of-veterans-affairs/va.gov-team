## Starting the Session | 10 minutes

[Have your camera on]

[If the participant doesn't show up in the first few minutes, reach out to Perigean on Slack.]

- Thank you for joining this session today! I first want to make sure that we're able to hear each other.
- [WAIT FOR RESPONSE - if can’t hear, [troubleshoot](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/troubleshooting-for-va-gov-research-sessions-in-pr#Troubleshootingresearchsessions-Problem:Usercannothearyou/youcan'thearthemonZoom) otherwise...]
- Great! I’m [YOUR NAME] and I’m a researcher for VA.gov. We have two other folks on the call right now, but before I allow them to introduce themselves, I want to check in with you on your preference with introductions. For example, some of us have our camera on at the moment, and we can describe our physical appearance and backgrounds if you’d like. Would you find that helpful?
   - [If wants description then offer yours: like hair length, hair color, eye color, skin tone, other defining feature, and background]
- I also have [NOTE TAKER NAME] here today to take some notes. I’ll ask them to introduce themself.
   - [PAUSE FOR NOTE TAKER to introduce themself]
- And also with us today are a couple VA accessibility specialists who've been helping set up research for assistive technology. I’ll ask they introduce themself now.
   - [PAUSE FOR a11y specialist to introduce themself]
- We also have a couple other team members who would like to join the call to help take take notes or observe and learn. Even though Perigean did previously ask for your consent to allow people to observe today, I know things can change, so I'd like to confirm with you now. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers joining us during this session?
   - [If NO]: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - [If YES]: Admit observers.
      - Let’s have each of our observers quickly go around and introduce themselves with cameras on, please.
      - [LET THEM KNOW PREF for descriptions or no]
      - [PAUSE for observers to introduce themselves]
      - Ok and now I’ll ask our notetakers and observers to mute themselves and turn off their cameras for the remainder of the sessions to save on distractions and to save Zoom bandwidth.
- Now that we've all introduced ourselves, I'd also love for you to tell us a little about yourself.
   - [PAUSE FOR PARTICIPANT to introduce themself]
- Nice to meet you! We really appreaciate you spending some time with us to help us make sure our design is usable.
---
- Let's get further into the session setup items. The subject of our research today is the sign in process on VA.gov and in particular the Terms of Use agreement. We are not testing your ability in any way. It is a prototpye design the is being tested
   - A bit later on, I’ll ask you to interact with a prototype using your screen reader. It'll mimic VA.gov, so it may seem real, but it won't be.
   - We use prototypes to help us test things before we decide what to make real.
   - We won’t ask you to access your VA account or bring up your actual VA information.
- We want to hear your honest opinions. We will not be offended by any opinions you express, and we welcome your candid feedback.
- This entire session should take no more than 1.5 hours.
- We do want you to be as comfortable as possible, so if for any reason and at any time you want to pause or even stop the session, please let me know.
- Any questions so far?
- Ok just a few more setup items.
- We sometimes use written quotes from our notes to help others at the VA understand why we want to make certain changes, but your name and information will not be directly linked to any of your comments.
   - Are you comfortable with use using quotes from our discussion today?
- I'd also like to ask your permission to record our discussion today. This helps us if we need to look back for clarifications like to make sure we noted your opinions correctly. We delete recordings after we finish analysis, which usually takes a couple weeks. Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and our audio as we talk today?
   - [IF YES - RECORD TO CLOUD] 
   - Now that we're recording, I have to confirm once more - are you are ok if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- [WAIT FOR RESPONSE]
- Ok, that's it for set up items! Do you have any questions on any of this setup stuff before we start?

  
## Round 1, Starter Questions | 10 minutes
- I’d like to start by asking you a few questions to get to know how you access VA services online
- Could you first let me know what device you are using right now for this call.
   - [Phone, laptop, doesn’t have to be brand]
- I understand that you use a screen reader - what app do you use the most for that?
   - [Apple Voice Over, JAWS, NVDA]
- What would you say your proficiency level is on that screen reader?
   - [are you a beginner? Used it for several years?]
- How do you generally navigate a website when using a screen reader?
   - [skip to headers, links, tab through each item?]
- [SKIP IF already answered or described as 100% blind] When you are accessing a website, how often do you use a screen reader?
- Thinking about the VA online, do you generally use [DEVICE] most often?
   - Any particular reason you use [DEVICE] the most
- Would you mind telling me what VA services you normally access online or perhaps why you went on to VA.gov most recently.
   - [remember this for later on]
- Other than the VA, do you sign into other services online? Maybe a bank or social media?
   - Has another service like a bank or social media site ever asked you to agree to thier terms of use.
   - If you had to explain what is "terms of use" how would you describe it to me if I was a 2nd grader?
      - [NOTE this is different than cookies, if mentioned try to redirect - this would be only after you sign in]
- Do you recall the last time a website or an app asked you to agree to a terms of use?
   - Can you explain how that went
   - Do you remember what you thought about when you saw that come up?
      - [PROMPTS] Did you have any questions when this came up? Any unease or maybe it made you feel better to see it?
   - Do you remember what you did when you saw that come up? 
      - [PROMPTS] When did it come up? How much did you have the screen reader go through? How much time did you spend from when it came up to clicking past that? 
  
## Round 2, Task - Prototype | 30 minutes
### Prototype Subtask - The setup
- Ok so now I’d like to bring up the prototype design. Just a quick reminder that this is not real but a design that we are thinking about using. Also because it is not the VA.gov, but an early draft version of a page it will act differently with your screen reader than you may be used to.
- For example, because things are in a draft format we had to manipulate some elements to work with a screen reader. Headings may announce as text. Some other elements may announce as images, which may seem out of place. Also it means that you won't be able to navigate through headings right now or using the tab key, but that **you'll have to use the VO and forward or back button to move through each element on the page for today.**
- If you have any questions about anything including what an element is actually supposed to be, please ask, and I can clarify.
- I know some of this will make it a bit awkward, but remember we aren't testing you, but you are helping us test this new part of the website.
- Does that seem ok so far?
- Ok we had Perigean send a link to you in email, but we could instead send it in the zoom chat. Would you prefer to grab that from your email?
   - [SEND LINK BY PREFERRED METHOD]
   - [Screen reader prototype link](https://www.figma.com/proto/Fhw9P7r6pyaCGXRmolruoQ/Terms-of-Use?type=design&node-id=381-31&t=6Iu86HTNhe9kB8yC-0&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=381%3A31)
- Let me know if you have any issues opening up that link
- Once you open the link in your web browser, I’ll then ask that in Zoom you select the option to share your screen. If you aren't familiar with that, we can guide you there.
   - [Desktop screen share help](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362153-Sharing-your-screen-or-desktop-on-Zoom) 
- Ok I think we are good to go, so I'll ask you to imagine that you are going onto VA.gov to [DO TASK FROM EARLIER]
- [SCREEN READER NOTE: participant will have to tab in browser to "skip to content" on Figma page]
   - [Once on the content wait from it to render for screen readers]
- Your best way to navigate on this design will be to use your VO key with the left and right arrow keys, not the tab key.
- Would you like a chance to go through some of the page?
- Considering the wonky bits about this page and how you have to navigate, does this page seem like where you would normally go?
   - [IF normally uses MHV have them imagine they need to sign into VA.gov for another reason]
- Would you normally sign in first thing before getting started?
   - Go ahead and sign in.
- [Continue signing in - credential selection page]
   - Which option do you usually choose to sign in here?
   - Ok, for today we'll ask that you choose the ID.me button even if that's not how you usually sign in.
   - How you describe this page that you're on now?
   - I do want you to fake sign in. We’ll use the fake email and password that is already added in here
   - Before you sign in, I'm curious what you expect after you select the sign-in button
      - Ok go ahead and continue signing in

### Prototype Subtask - Questions
- Now that you are signed in, can you tell me about this page?
   - [PROMPTS] What did you expect to come up here? 
       - What do you understand this page to mean?
       - Did you know that VA had terms of use?
       - What do you think about being presented with terms of use for the VA online?
- Recall that we are pretending you are signing in today to [TASK]. Take as much time to go through this page as you would in that instance.
    - Do any thoughts come to mind? Any questions? Did anything seem strange or set up in a way that was difficult to move through or understand?
- Ok so if you feel like you have the information you need from this page, what would you do next? DONT DO IT YET!
   - When a Terms of Use comes up on a website other than VA, have you taken the same action there?
   - Do you consider the terms of use here on the VA in the same way as you would on another sites? 
- Is their any value to you in a terms of use like this page?
   - [PROMPT] like do you feel like you get anything out of it?
- Does this terms of use or the information on this page affect your trust with the VA?
   - Does it affect any feelings of security or insecurity you may have around interacting with the VA online?
- On other websites when something like this has come up, do you usually accept the terms or would you decline? [TRY TO redirect if talks about cookies]
- How strongly do you generally feel about [ACCEPTING or DECLINING] the terms of use on a website?
   - Has there ever been a time when you didn’t agree to these types of terms on a website or app?
      - Can you tell me more about that?
      - What would you generally expeect to happened when you didn't agree to a website's term of use agreement?
   - For a website or app you use regularly, have you noticed a time recently when they said they updated their terms and you have to review them and agree to them again?
      - How did you react to that?
- [IF HAVENT DISCUSSED THE accordian items] Let’s pretend you wanted to read through all or some of the information here, can you take me through a little bit of that?
- Have you ever downloaded or saved a copy of any website terms of use in the past?
   - If you wanted to save a copy of the VA terms of use here, how might you do that? 
- If you needed help with the terms of use or with this page, where would you go, who would you turn to?
- Is there any information that you’d want that you don’t find here?

### Prototype Subtask - move past TOU
- Let's say you want to agree to the terms here. Don't take any actions on the page yet, but what would you do?
   - And after that what would you expect to happen?
- [GUIDE PARTICIPANT TO BOTTOM of page, if they haven't made it there yet]
- This might sound a little silly, but can you give me your definition of “accept”
   - And what about your definition of "decline"?
   - We have “accept” and “decline” buttons here. Would it change anything for you if we renamed the decline button to “not accept”? Meaning the options are accept and not accept.
      - [IF Participant is feeling the vocab discussion, can also ask about “reject” and “refuse” and also about having the buttons simply say "yes" or "no"]
- Let’s say the lawyers get together again and decide something needed to change here on this terms of use. If a change happened how would you expect to hear about it? Maybe get something like this page about it again?
      - What would you want to know about the update?
      - Would it make a difference if it was a smaller change vs a larger change? 
- Now let’s assume you’d select “decline” - don’t actually do it yet - what would you expect to happen?
   - Go ahead and select “decline”
   - What do you think about this information here?
   - What is your understanding of what this page is telling you?

## Round 3 - Closing Q’s and Thank you | 5 minutes
- That's all the questions that I wanted to cover today. I’m going to check my messages to see if notetakers or observers had any questions they wanted to ask or follow up on.
   - [Ask questions as needed]
- Do you have any questions or further comments about what we discussed today?
- We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on VA.gov to make sure it works for Veterans.
- Before we end this call, a few final logistic items - Perigean is who set up the scheduling with you - they will get you set up with the thank you stipend. They will also send you information that you can pass on to other Veterans you may know who would want a chance to participate in future sessions like this.
- Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

### Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]

- I really appreciate you taking some time with us today. I have now covered all the questions we have for you. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.

OR
- I am so sorry, but the prototype we wanted to test with you today is having a glitch and we aren’t going to be able to use that. Unfortunately, we’ll need to end the session. I apologize for that, but I appreciate your willingness to help us on this.
