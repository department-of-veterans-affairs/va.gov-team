## Starting the Session | 10 minutes

[Have your camera on]

[If the participant doesn't show up in the first few minutes, reach out to Perigean on Slack.]

- Thank you for joining this session today! I first want to make sure that we're able to hear each other.
- [WAIT FOR RESPONSE - if can’t hear, [troubleshoot](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/troubleshooting-for-va-gov-research-sessions-in-pr#Troubleshootingresearchsessions-Problem:Usercannothearyou/youcan'thearthemonZoom) otherwise...]
- Great! I’m [YOUR NAME] and I’m a researcher for VA.gov. We have two other folks on the call right now, but before I allow them to introduce themselves, I want to check in with you on your preference with introductions. For example, we have our videos on at the moment, and we can describe our physical appearance if you’d like. Would you find that helpful?
[WAIT FOR RESPONSE if wants description then offer]
- I also have [NOTE TAKER NAME] here today to take some notes. I’ll ask them to introduce themself.
   - [PAUSE FOR NOTE TAKER to introduce themself]
- And also with us today is a VA accessibility specialist who can help us if we run into any snags using the screen reader on the design we’ve built and also if we have any questions about navigating zoom. I’ll ask they introduce themself now.
   - [PAUSE FOR a11y specialist to introduce themself]
- I'd also love for you to tell us a little about yourself.
   - [PAUSE FOR PARTICIPANT to introduce themself]
- Nice to meet you! We really appreaciate you spending some time with us to make sure our design is usable for folks who use screen readers.
- The subject of our research today is the sign in process on VA.gov and in particular the Terms of Use agreement. We are not testing your ability.
- Today we're going to talk about how you sign in to access and manage your VA benefits and health care.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. The goal is to improve this process to better meet veterans needs. We will not be offended by any opinions you express, and we welcome your candid feedback.
- A bit later on, I’ll ask you to interact with a prototype. Just to prepare you for that, it may seem real, but it won't be, and we won’t be accessing your account or real information.
   - We use prototypes to help us test things before we decide what to make real.
- This entire session should take no more than 1 hour.
- I do want you to be as comfortable as possible, so if for any reason and at any time you want to pause or even stop the session, please let me know.
- Any questions so far?
---
- OK so we also have a couple other team members who would like to join the call to observe and help take notes. We don’t want to be redundant, but even though Perigean did previously ask for your consent to allow people to observe today, but I know things can change, so I'd like to confirm with you. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers joining us during this session?
   - [If NO]: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - [If YES]: Admit observers.
      - Let’s have each of our observers quickly go around and introduce themselves with cameras on, please.
      - [LET THEM KNOW PREF for descriptions or no]
      - [PAUSE for observers to introduce themselves]
      - Ok and now I’ll ask our notetakers and observers to mute themselves and turn off their cameras for the remainder of the sessions to save on distractions and to save Zoom bandwidth.
- We sometimes use written quotes from our notes to help others at the VA understand why we want to make certain changes, but your name and information will not be directly linked to any of your comments.
Are you comfortable with that?
- I'd also like to ask your permission to record our discussion today. This helps us if we need to look back for clarifications like to make sure we noted your opinions correctly. We delete recordings after we finish analysis, which usually takes a couple weeks. Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and our audio as we talk today?
   - [IF YES - RECORD TO CLOUD] 
   - Now that we're recording, I have to confirm once more - are you are ok if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- [WAIT FOR RESPONSE]
- Ok, that's it for set up items! Do you have any questions on any of this setup stuff before we start?

  
## Round 1, Starter Questions | 5-10 minutes
- I’d like to start by asking you a few questions to get to know how you access VA services online
- Could you first let me know what device you are using right now for this call.
   - [Phone, laptop, doesn’t have to be brand]
- I understand that you use a screen reader - what app do you use the most for that?
   - [Apple Voice Over, JAWS, NVDA]
- What would you say your proficiency level is on that screen reader?
   - [are you a beginner? Used it for several years?]- How do you generally navigate a website when using a screen reader?
   - [skip to headers, links, tab through each item?]
- [SKIP IF already answered or described as 100% blind] When you are accessing a website, how often do you use a screen reader?
- Thinking about the VA online, do you generally use [DEVICE] most often?
   - Any particular reason you use [DEVICE] the most
- Would you mind telling me what VA services you normally access online or perhaps why you went on to VA.gov most recently.
   - [remember this for later on]
- Other than the VA, do you sign into other services online? Like a bank or social media?
- Has another service like a bank or social media ever asked you to agree to terms of use.
   - [NOTE this is different than cookies, if mentioned try to redirect - this would be only after you sign in]
   - Do you remember what you thought about or what you did when you saw that come up?
   - Anything else come to mind when you think about that kind of thing?
- Do you recall the last time a website or an app asked you to agree to something like that?
   - Can you explain how that went
      - [PROMPTS] When did it come up? How much did you have the screen reader go through? How much time did you spend from when it came up to clicking past that? Was there any unease or questions that came to mind when this came up?
  
## Round 2, Task - Prototype | 15-20 minutes
- Ok so now I’d like to bring up the prototype design. Just a quick reminder that this is not real but a design that we are thinking about using. Also because it is not the VA.gov, it will act differently than you may be used to. For example, we don’t have a way to code things as headings if you are use to navigating that way. Other things the screen reader may first announce as a button or another part of the page but then also call it an image. That’s because this program we are using to design in, we kind of have to trick into working with a screen reader. If you have any questions about anything please ask. Also for this reason, I will also recommend that you take it a bit slower than you’d usually, this will also help us follow along.
- Seem ok so far?
- Ok I’m going to send you a link. I can send that through the Zoom application chat if that works for you.
   - If you’d prefer another method, let me know.
-[SEND LINK BY PREFERRED METHOD]
   - [Screen reader prototype link](https://www.figma.com/proto/Fhw9P7r6pyaCGXRmolruoQ/Terms-of-Use?type=design&node-id=381-31&t=6Iu86HTNhe9kB8yC-0&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=381%3A31&show-proto-sidebar=1)
- Let me know if you have any issues opening up that link
---
## below this point still needs to be reviewed for necessary adaptions for screen reader sessions
- Once you get that up, I’ll also ask that you share your screen
   - [Desktop screen share help](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362153-Sharing-your-screen-or-desktop-on-Zoom) 
- Ok so let’s imagine that you are going onto VA.gov to [DO TASK FROM EARLIER]
- Does this page look like where you would normally go?
   - [IF normally uses MHV have them imagine they need to sign into VA.gov for another reason]
- Would you normally sign in first thing before getting started?
   - Go ahead and start to sign in.
- [Continue signing in - credential selection page]
   - Which option do you usually choose to sign in here?
   - Ok, for today it won’t matter which you select, they’ll all take you to the same place.
   - We’ll use a fake email and password here, so you can move along through this part.
- Ok now that you are signed in, can you tell me what about this page?
   - [PROMPTS] What did you expect to come up here? 
       - What do you understand this page to mean?
       - Did you know that VA had terms of use?
       - What do you think about being presented with terms of use for the VA online?
 - Being on this page, what would you do next?
   - Is that what you have done on other websites that present new terms of use?
      - What would make you want to [SKIP PAST or READ THROUGH] this?
         - [IF SKIP] How would you move past this page?
   - Do you consider the terms of use here on the VA in the same way as other sites? 
- How much do you feel like this applies to you?
- How meaningful is this information to you?
- Does this information change how much you trust your online interactions with the VA?
- Is there any information that you’d want that you don’t find here?
<br>

- On other websites when something like this has come up, do you usually accept the terms or would you decline? [TRY TO redirect if talks about cookies]
- How strongly do you generally feel about [ACCEPTING or DECLINING] the terms of use on a website?
   - Has there ever been a time when you didn’t agree to these types of terms on a website or app?
      - Can you tell me more about that?
   - For a website or app you use regularly, have you noticed a time recently when they said they updated their terms and you have to look at them and agree to them again?
      - How did you react to that?
- Let’s pretend you wanted to read through the information here, how would you do that?
- Let’s pretend you didn’t want to agree to these terms here, at least right now. What would you do?
   - What would you expect the buttons (at bottom of page) to do?
   - This might sound a little silly, but can you give me your definition of “accept”
      - What about “decline”
   - We have “accept” and “decline” buttons here. Would it change anything for you if we renamed the decline button to “not accept”? So the options are accept and not accept.
      - [IF Participant is feeling the vocab discussion, can also ask about “reject” and “refuse” and also about having the buttons simply say "yes" or "no"]
- Let assume you’d select “accept” - don’t actually do it yet - what would you expect to happen next?
   - Let’s say the lawyers get together again and decide something needed to change here on this terms of use. If a change happened would you expect to get something like this full page about it again?
      - Would you want to know about the update?
      - Would it make a difference if it was a smaller change vs a larger change?  
- Now let’s assume you’d select “decline” - don’t actually do it yet - what would you expect to happen?
   - Go ahead and select “decline”
   - What do you think about this information here?

## Round 3 - Closing Q’s and Thank you | minutes
- That's all the questions that I wanted to cover today. I’m going to look at my messages to see if notetakers or observers had any questions they wanted to ask or follow up on.
   - [Ask questions as needed]
- Do you have any questions or further comments about what we discussed today?
- We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on VA.gov to make sure it works for Veterans.
- Before we end this call, a few final logistic items - Perigean is who set up the scheduling with you - they will get you set up with the thank you stipend. They will also send you information that you can pass on to other Veterans you may know who would want a chance to participate in future sessions like this.
- Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Session Helps
### Instructions for finding Zoom chat (if needed)
- In the Zoom application on your phone or computer, you'll see a row of buttons at the bottom. 
  - Computer: Just to the left of center is a conversation bubble that says **Chat**. 
    - *If don't see chat, ASK:* Do you see the red **Stop Share** button? If so, put your mouse just above it and see if you see more Zoom controls. Then click on the **Chat** button in the center of the Zoom controls.
  - Phone: On the far right is a **More** button or **3 dots**. Tap that and then on Chat or the conversation bubble. 
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.

### Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]

- I really appreciate you taking some time with us today. I have now covered all the questions we have for you. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.

OR
- I am so sorry, but the prototype we wanted to test with you today is having a glitch and we aren’t going to be able to use that. Unfortunately, we’ll need to end the session. I apologize for that, but I appreciate your willingness to help us on this.
