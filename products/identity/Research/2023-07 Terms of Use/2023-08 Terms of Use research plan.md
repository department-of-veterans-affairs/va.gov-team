# Research Plan for Identity, Terms of Use, 2023-07

## Background
VA would like everyone utilizing VA.gov and it's surrounding sites and services to be presented with a unified version of the Terms and Conditions that they will have to agree to in order to continue utilizing the authenticated experience
- [product info](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity/terms%20and%20conditions)


### OCTO Objectives 

- Veterans and their families can apply for all benefits online
- Veterans can manage their health services online
- Veterans and their families trust the security, accuracy, and relevancy of VA.gov


### Veteran Journey

Securely accessing VA online services can happen at any stage in the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf). The updated Terms of Use will apply to every who signs into VA online and uses the authenticated experience.

## Research Goals	

- Explore veterans thinking around terms of use, both in general and as it relates to VA.gov
- Understand how the sign in experience would be affected with a terms of use page interrupting the flow 
- Test the usability of a prototype for updated terms of use


### Outcome

Learn what pain points the current design has with various audiences - especially since this page will be a precursor to continuing to use the authenticated experience, we need the design to be as smooth and usable as possible for everyone.


### Research questions

- Does the prototype allow users to successfully understand the updated Terms of Use?
- Are folks able to successfully complete this page in order to move onto the authenticated experience?
- Is there a substantial usability difference between certain language and design options?
- What changes would make the prototype more helpful or more usable?


### Hypothesis

- Veterans will be familiar with terms of use from other sites and and apps
- Veterans will see needing to agree to an updated terms with VA as a nuisance
- Veterans will opt to click past this as quickly as possible, including by not reading any long paragraphs, so they can move on to their task at hand.


## Methodology	

Remote usability testing will evaluate the prototype with participants. We’ll use Perigean’s Zoom account for these remote sessions. We plan to test with both mobile and desktop users and with assistive tech users.
