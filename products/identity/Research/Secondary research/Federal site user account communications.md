## **IRS Notifications**

The IRS is strategically working towards providing taxpayers with the same online functionality as banks and other financial institutions. 

Key developments include:

Online Response to Notices: Taxpayers can now respond to all IRS notices and letters online that do not require a filing or payment action. This feature was gradually expanded throughout 2023, with over 45,000 responses received via the online tool by December.

Processing Status for Tax Forms: A public-facing dashboard has been launched to display the current processing status for key forms and general correspondence. The status reflects processing times for electronically filed forms and the month of receipt currently being processed for paper forms.

Voice Bots: Natural language voice bots have been launched for queries about refunds and amended returns, allowing taxpayers to ask questions in a conversational manner.

Expanded Online Platform Functionality: Updates to the Individual Online Account now allow multiple bank accounts to be saved and validated, payments to be scheduled and canceled, and payment plans to be expanded and revised. The second phase of the Business Tax Account has been launched, expanding its capabilities and eligible entity types. The Tax Pro Account has also been enhanced to allow management of active client authorizations and viewing of individual and business clients’ tax information.

Modernizing Technology: The IRS is updating its technology to improve customer service and protect taxpayer data. This includes significant progress in scanning and e-filing paper returns, with more than 1.5 million forms scanned during 2023.
