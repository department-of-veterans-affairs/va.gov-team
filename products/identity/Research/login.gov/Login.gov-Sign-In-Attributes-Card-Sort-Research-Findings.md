# Research Goals

VA.gov will be adding another credential service provider to the sign in modal. To better understand how to present language to users about sign-in providers, we have to understand what they value in the providers that we currently offer. The desire is to make sure changes are seamless and we uphold a positive user experience. 

Our goal was to understand what information do Veterans find most important or least important in a sign-in option and which type of credential provider would users prefer given the choice of government-created or private sector?

<br>

# Research Questions

*Attributes of government-created and private sector credentials*

1. Do users prefer government-created credentials or private sector-created credentials?
2. Out of the attributes provided, what information is most and least important when selecting a sign-in provider?
3. What other attributes do users value in a sign-in provider?

<br>
 
## Research Methodology

- Remote unmoderated Card Sort

<br>

## <a name=”hypothesis-and-conclusions”></a>Hypothesis and Conclusions

When presented with a list of attributes about government-created and privately owned sign-in options, participants will be able to rank their most important and least important attributes.

Definitely True:
Using the card sort participants were able to rank all the attribute cards from most important to least important (with no cards being unsorted)

<br>

# <a name=”key-findings”></a>Key Findings

1. “The sign in option is free” data points are spread out

2. 56.6% of users prefer “The sign in option is free” as important or extremely important.

3. 56.7% of users are okay with the process being created through a privately owned company.

4. Users want the sign in process to be secure and compliant to the latest federal guidelines.

5. “The sign in option is created, maintained, and secured by the U.S. Government.” is quite sparse.

6. There is a 4.9% of users that find that“ the sign in option protects my privacy” is not important at all.

7. “The sign in option gives me access to many government services with a  single account (eg: VA, Social Security, USA Jobs, etc.)” is important, or extremely important.

### **Finding 1 - “The sign in option is free” data points are spread out**

Labels: PRDT: identity, RESRCH: Remote, RESRCH: Usability

“The sign in option is free” users are well spread. A new approach to this question should be taken. Maybe if the question is rephrased.

### **Finding 2 - 56.6% of users prefer “The sign in option is free” as important or extremely important.**

Labels: PRDT: identity, RESRCH: Remote, RESRCH: Usability

About 56.6% of users prefer “The sign in option is free” as important or extremely important. This does not mean that 44.4% of users find it neutral or not important at all, but rather there was no indication of cost.

<br>

### **Finding 3 - 56.7% of users okay with the process being created through a privately owned company.**

Labels: PRDT: identity, RESRCH: Remote, RESRCH: Usability

“The sign in option is created, maintained, and secured by a privately owned company.”  finds about 56.7% of users okay with the process being created through a privately owned company. It seems like only 20% of users would rather have the sign in option be created by a different owner. This should be explored.

<br>

### **Finding 4 - Users want the sign in process to be secure and compliant to the latest federal guidelines.**

Labels: PRDT: identity, RESRCH: Remote, RESRCH: Usability

Users want the sign in process to be secure and compliant to latest federal guidelines. Do users know about this expectation or do they want more security? The data does not explain their behavior or decisions.

### **Finding 5 - “The sign in option is created, maintained, and secured by the U.S. Government.” is quite sparse.**

Labels: PRDT: identity, RESRCH: Remote, RESRCH: Usability

“The sign in option is created, maintained, and secured by the U.S. Government.” is quite sparse. 53.3% would like the government to own the sign in option. 30% feel neutral.

### **Finding 6 - There is a 4.9% of users that find that “The sign in option protects my privacy” is not important at all.**

Labels: PRDT: identity, RESRCH: Remote, RESRCH: Usability

There is a 4.9% of users that find that “The sign in option protects my privacy” is not important at all. This is pretty concerning and should be explored. Is there a pain point or rather the question is unclear?

### **Finding 7 - “The sign in option gives me access to many government services with a  single account (eg: VA, Social Security, USA Jobs, etc.)” is important, or extremely important.**

Labels: PRDT: identity, RESRCH: Remote, RESRCH: Usability

76.7% or 46 participants feel that “The sign in option gives me access to many government services with a  single account (eg: VA, Social Security, USA Jobs, etc.)” is important, or extremely important. If users want a single sign in to access more government services, this might be a feature that should be looked into.

# Additional Insights

This was a comment from a user in one of the user segments. This was the only comment given in the card sort.
 > _"I worry in this day and time with hackers, neither the US Govt or most privately owned companies can prevent hackers getting into their computers and accessing our information. Why not just have a sign in with a second access with ones cell phone, and when the person is done, and logs out, their sign-in info is deleted."_

<br>

# <a name="recommendations"></a>Recommendations

The study could have a bit of moderation that can help answer unclear instructions. A facilitator can help greatly.

* Recommendation 1
    * _Before the card sort, a facilitator can explain the task_
* Recommendation 2
    * _A facilitator can be available to help answer any questions for users_
* Recommendation 3
    * _A facilitator can help close the session and ask for additional comments_

<br>

# Next Steps

Share ranking of attributes with comms and marketing. Could be useful in guiding how VA communicates the changes to credential providers.
