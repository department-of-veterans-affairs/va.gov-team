# Research Goals

Our goal is to make the login experience more accessible for low vision and no vision users. Specifically, the goal of this study is to find any issues or pain points when using screen readers and other assistive technologies to log in to VA.gov.

- Discover how users navigate the login portion of our new login page
- Discover any inconsistencies regarding the current design of the login page i.e. pain points for our users
- Being able to test the efficiency of the current login page. Finding measurements.

<br>

# Research Questions

1. How long would a user who is new to assisted technology take to get through the sign-in process?
2. How long would a user who is familiar with assisted technology take to get through the sign-in process?
3. What sort of pain points are not addressed before sign-in?
4. How often does a veteran who uses assistive technology access VA.gov?
5. What operating systems or devices are mostly used with assisted technology? What do the user groups prefer?
6. What usability issues does the design of the sign-in modal present for Veterans using assistive technology?
7. What technical issues are they encountering?
8. What tasks do they typically log in for?

## Research Methodology

- Remote moderated user interviews

We chose this method in order to:

- Observe how users navigate the login page using a screen reader.
- Observe where users are having difficulty in different areas of the login experience.
- Ask returning users to evaluate this experience vs the previous experience.

<br>

## <a name=”hypothesis-and-conclusions”></a>Hypothesis and Conclusions

We believe that low vision and no vision users will bring insight to the login process, making the login experience more accessible for all users. By simplifying the interface, signing in with screen readers can be a straightforward process so that users can access their benefits quicker.

We believe that coding the credential options as buttons and not links will provide a better user experience

Definitely  True:
All participants were able to find and select their preferred credential provider with little to no trouble. Within the first five to ten minutes of sharing their screen, most participants were able to log in

<br>

# <a name=”key-findings”></a>Key Findings

1. Participants who mentioned having multiple credential providers preferred to sign in with MyHealthyVet
2. Sign-in took approximately five to ten minutes to complete due to factors such as: 
 - Letting screen readers read out key areas of sign-in
 - Using multiple assitive technology in tandem with their phones
3. Half of the participants acknowledged giving/receiving assistance from others when accessing VA.gov  
4. Most participants stated that they would typically start the sign-in process from My HealtheVet or E-benefits rather than VA.gov
    - Often completing tasks having to do with checking claims, messaging providers, or checking the status of medication
5. Most participants would spend twenty minutes to one hour on VA.gov looking through content, checking prescriptions, or using secure messaging.
6. Most participants that use assistive technology are intermediate-level users.
7. Most Zoom and Magnify users find different methods for their assistive tech
    - Some users used large TV screens or monitors
8. Most Screen Reader users find too much information per page (after login).
    - Mostly, users will let the screen readers read the whole page before interacting with the content
9. For some Screen Reader users, the content is repetitive and informs them to log in again.
10. When users find it difficult to log in, they turn to different sites and applications
11. Most participants knew who to contact when there were technical issues with VA.gov or their AT.
    - Outside to study- Issues with password management (changes to credentials)
    - During study- Participants experience issues after the redirects in which they received error messages or were directed elsewhere (AccessVA)
12. Significant usability issues:
    - Not confirming if the user has made mistakes in logon (Screen Readers)
    - Using images for CAPTCHA (Screen Readers) (DS Logon)
    - Small fonts (Zoom and Magnify)
    - PDFs downloaded from VA.gov do not work with assistive technology
13. Before sign-in, participants experienced pain points around multifactor authentication.
    - Screen readers take time to tab through, and users could be timed out before finishing a task.

# Additional Insights

## Regarding High Contrast
- Adobe PDF Accessibility
    - Most forms have to be downloaded and then, if compatible, be seen in dark mode.
    - Forms that are downloaded sometimes are not compatible with using dark mode.
- When using Zoom or other screen recordings, only the participant has their dark mode or high contrast enabled. Most of the time, moderators or facilitators cannot observe the screen.
- For each new device, photo-sensitive users must set dark mode or high contrast.
- A participant mentioned that purple is a good and safe color. References [New York State University](https://www.nyu.edu/) as a good color that does not affect them.
- Not all high-contrast or dark modes work for the browsers when viewing VA.gov. Participants attributed this to the plugin.

## Regarding Web Browsers
- List of browsers:
    - 2 Participants used Chrome
    - 3 Participants used Safari
    - 2 Participants used Microsoft Edge
    - 1 Participant used Brave Browser
- 5 of the 8 participants bookmarked [MyHealthyvet](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/home) and [VA.gov](https://www.va.gov/)

## Regarding Caregivers and Family for Login
- Veterans want separate logins for Caregivers and Family members.
    - The new logins would be tied to the Veteran. Still, they will not disclose personal information aside from the basic tasks such as refilling prescriptions, checking dates, and contacting other medical needs.
- Veterans do not want to share their passwords with caregivers.
- When Veterans might need help regarding reading or comprehension, they might turn to their significant others or spouse for help.
    - 2 Participants had a spouse help through the study

## Regarding Password Management and Security
- For screen reader users, when typing passwords, the "*" or "star" is echoed.
    - 1 Participant ran to this issue with JAWS
- When a participant that uses a screen reader cannot log in, it is difficult for the participant to verify what password or log in credential was incorrect.
- Sometimes, a user will not be using their personal computer. They will not have their passwords.
- 1 Participant mentioned that they would have to change their password each time they login in. That participant only logins once a year.
- When a screen reader participant uses an additional device such as a phone for Two-Factor-Authentication, they have to use two different screen readers. First, they need to listen to the code on the phone and transcribe it to their computer.
- 1 Participant commits their password(s) and login(s) to memory
- 1 Participant commits their password(s) and login(s) to writing
- 1 Participant commits their password(s) and login(s) to a text file

## Regarding Suggested Features
- Having a live chat or chatbot
- Would like to have a discussion forum to seek help from other Veterans or customer service
- Would like to have articles or areas of large copy to have an HTML or web-based reader
- Would like to have a single login for all government sites
- Would like to have a biometric sign-in option. Fingerprint scanner
- When using Two-Factor Authentication, the ability to use face ID would save time
- Would like to have push notifications for login

# <a name="recommendations"></a>Recommendations

## Regarding Sign-In
- When it comes to using captcha, we should avoid using images for limited-vision users
- The font sizes will need to be increased for the 2FA portion for ZoomText users
- Increase the time needed for Multi-Factor-Authentication. Limited vision and screen reader users take extra time to use their devices to get a code. This is most prominent if the user does not use an Apple product with push notifications
- Finding solutions for Caregivers or Family members to securely sign in to VA.gov without sharing crucial information of a user.

## Regarding VA.gov website and content
- Make content across all of VA.gov more accessible to navigate and read. Reducing the amount of content per page. Prioritize the most important content.
- The search function on the website should be easier to see or navigate to. Users should be able to use more tools to redirect back to their tasks.

## Regarding Accessibility and A11y
- Most assistive tech users do not scan through the content.
- Most users reported being at an intermediate level of their selected accessibility tech. This is only true for users that have used screen readers and magnification tools for more than four years.
- Having a baseline training would be beneficial for users that need the A11y needs.
- Most screen reader users will listen to all of the content before interacting with the page unless they are familiar with the content.
- Looking into ways to integrate or embed assistive technology into the site.

<br>

# Next Steps
- Share findings with other teams that may be affected by the sign-in process
- Finding solutions regarding a simple single login function for [VA.gov](https://www.va.gov/)
- Address errors that participants went through during the study
- Finding solutions for caregivers and spouses for their logins to keep the privacy of the veterans

<br>

# <a name="further-research-needed"></a>Further research needed

- Although there were some datapoints regarding photo-sensitivity, a study regarding high contrast modes and dark modes will be helpful for accessibility for users
