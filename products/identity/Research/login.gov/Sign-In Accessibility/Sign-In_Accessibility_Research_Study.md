# Research Plan for [Identity, Accessibility Research for New sign-in Modal, 12/3/21]

## Background


This research is for the Office of the CTO - Digital Experience (OCTODE)- Identity Team Leads for VA.gov. This research study is being informed by moderated (August) and unmoderated (October) studies that were conducted in 2021. Both studies focused on the Veteran sign-in experience on VA.gov, specifically changes to the sign-in modal. With this research, the Identity team hopes to understand the user experience on VA.gov from an accessibility perspective and to test the redesign of the sign-in options for low vision/no vision and other users with disabilities relying on assistive technology.

MHV users will soon be directed to VA.gov with a redesign of the sign-in options. An easily navigable experience is critical. VA.gov and the sign-in options are where the authenticated experience will start for users to access products and services. Sign-in through VA.gov will be new for some users that are anticipated to be part of the research. For users that have been to VA.gov, the redesign is an iteration of the experience and the credential options (Login.gov will be new)
 

### OCTO Objectives 

>Which [OCTO objectives] (https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

1. Increase the quality and reliability of VA services

- Veterans and their families can apply for all benefits online
- Veterans can manage their health services online
- Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
- Veterans and their families trust the security accuracy and relevancy of VA.gov

_All of the above are dependent on an easy and secure sign-in experience_

### Veteran Journey
>Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)?<br>Are there moments that matter? 

Our product fits in at the start of the Veteran Journey from Serving in the Military through Getting Out and Starting Up.  However, it additionally serves the Veteran throughout their journey because they may receive VA services throughout their life.

Starting Up
- Attending to health needs

Our product fits into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) at the Taking care of myself Life Stage. At this moment a veteran is looking to find help and support for their health.

Taking care of self
- Managing primary care and chronic health issues
- Maintaining my health

## Research Goals	
>What are you trying to learn from this research?

Our goal is to make the login experience more accessible for low vision and no vision users. Specifically, the goal of this study is to find any issues or pain points when using a screen reader to log in to VA.gov.

### Outcome
>How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?

- This research will inform design or functionality changes needed to increase accessibility on VA.gov and to address any pain points with the redesign of sign-in options

- Learnings will be incorporated into future design and functionality and shared with other teams to inform accessibility considerations of other products and services

- The results will also be used to inform subsequent rounds of user research and testing.

### Research questions


1. How long would a user who is new to assisted technology take to get through the sign-in process?
2. How long would a user who is familiar with assisted technology take to get through the sign-in process?
3. What sort of pain points are not addressed before sign-in?
4. How often does a veteran who uses assistive technology access VA.gov?
5. What operating systems or devices are mostly used with assisted technology? What do the user groups prefer?
6. What usability issues does the design of the sign-in modal present for Veterans using assistive technology?
7. What technical issues are they encountering?
8. What tasks do they typically log in for?


### Hypothesis
>What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.


We believe that low vision and no vision users will bring insight to the login process, making the login experience more accessible for all users. By simplifying the interface, signing in with screen readers can be a straightforward process so that users can access their benefits quicker.

We believe that coding the credential options as buttons and not links will provide a better user experience

## Method	
>Describe the method you’re planning. You should be able to explain why this method is appropriate for the goals of the research and the maturity of the design. 

Remote moderated usability test via the application that can satisfy our criteria:
- Being able to record the session
- Being able to record the user's screen

Our goals include:
- Discover how users navigate the login portion of our new login page
- Discover any inconsistencies regarding the current design of the login page i.e. pain points for our users
- Being able to test the efficiency of the current login page. Finding measurements.

>What method of research are you planning to use?
Remote, semi-moderated sessions
- We will need to use a video conferencing tool that allows users to record and share their screen(s) while using a screen reader.

>Why this method? How does this help you answer your research questions?
- We can see how users navigate the login page using a screen reader.
- We can see where users are having difficulty in different areas of the login experience.
- For returning users, we can ask them to evaluate this experience vs the previous one.

## Previous research


- This research study was conducted to understand the Veteran sign-in experience on VA websites and gage first impressions of Login.gov, a new credential provider.  [VA.gov Login process, August 2021](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/login.gov/Login.gov-research-plan.md)

- This research study was conducted in a two-part unmoderated study. Using a card sort Participants were asked to rank attributes of credential providers from most important to least important. In a first-click study, participants were tasked with logging in to see if they were able to easily locate their CSP with the new design changes  [Sign-in redesign and provider attributes, October 2021](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/login.gov/signin-provider-research-plan.md)
