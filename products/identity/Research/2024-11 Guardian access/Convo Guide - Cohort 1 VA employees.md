# Convo guide for talking with cohort 1, VA employees who help folks set up guaridan relationships with veterans

## Intro
* We want to learn more about how guardians set up that relationship officially with the VA
* Our focus is especially on court appointed guardians, so mostly in situations where a veteran is incapacitated
  
## General Questions

* What is your role in the VA?   
* What kinds of things do you work on?  
* I do want to narrow in on a group of folks who have been appointed by a legal court to be a guardian over a veteran. That could be to help a veteran manage their healthcare or to manage their finances or both when they are not able to do that themselves.  
  * Do you ever work with folks in that situation?  
  * How much time would you say you spend with people in this situation?  
  * What kind of things are you generally helping with in this situation?

## What to call guardians

* I do want to get on the same page with you about what to call people in this situation. Is there a name or label or a classification you give these folks? It could be official or not.  
  * Court-appointed guardian? Caregiver? Something else?  
* Do you ever hear these folks talk about themselves using a particular name or label?  
* And then on the official side \- what name or label do court documents or VA forms or other paperwork tend to give these folks?  
* I do want to let you know that I generally call them “guardians” so if you hear me say that throughout this discussion, that’s who I’m referring to.

## Setting up a guardian with VA

* How do guardians learn about accessing VA benefits on behalf of a veteran they are guardian over?  
* Is it always a guardian who initiates this with VA?   
  * Does the court or Veteran or someone else ever start guardianship flow with the VA?  
* What court or other documentation is needed to start?  
* What VA forms or other paper work is needed? Is it done at the individual VAMC level?  
  * What VA forms are needed?  
    * If VA forms are out of date, what needs to happen? By who? Is that a blocker?  
  * Ask about [specific forms here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Research/2024-11%20Guardian%20access/delegate%20related%20forms.md)

## Setting up a guardian with VA online/digital access

* To get set up on the digital side (with MVH or VA.gov)  
  * What does a guardian need to do with you or other VA employees?  
  * What does a guardian need to do with any VA systems (like MHV or VA.gov)?  
  * What do you or another VA employee do with any VA systems (like MHV or VA.gov)?  
* What does it look like for a guardian to take over or manage a Veteran’s VA account?  
  * What are the steps a guardian has to take to set this up?  
  * What actions do you or others at the VA need to do?  
  * Does the Veteran "give" credentials to a guardian? Does VA ever reset an account to hand credentials over to a guardian?  
  * Does VA make a new MHV account if needed?  
  * Is anything indicated on the account or MPI or anywhere? What happens if a Veteran calls the help desk to reset the Veteran account?  
    * What about a situation of a guardian who uses the Veteran’s account in improper ways?

## Audit logs

* What are VA needs and expectations around audit logs (ie account task history)?  
  * And for your work, do you have any particular needs with audit logs for a veteran’s account?  
* Do you have any insight on what guardian's needs and expectations are around audit logs (ie account task history)?  
* What is the current process for offboarding a guardian, one who is no longer managing a Veteran’s VA account?
