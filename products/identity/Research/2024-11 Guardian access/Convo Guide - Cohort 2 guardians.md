## **Starting the session | 5 minutes**

* [Have your camera on] [If the participant doesn't show up in the first few minutes, reach out to Perigean on Slack.]
* Thank you for joining this session today! I first want to make sure that we're able to hear each other.  
* [WAIT FOR RESPONSE]- if you can’t hear, [troubleshoot](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/troubleshooting-for-va-gov-research-sessions-in-pr#Troubleshootingresearchsessions-Problem:Usercannothearyou/youcan'thearthemonZoom) otherwise...]  
* Great! I’m [YOUR NAME] and I’m a researcher for VA.gov.  
* I also have [NOTE TAKER NAME] here today to take some notes. I’ll ask them to introduce themself.  
   * [PAUSE FOR NOTE TAKER to introduce themself]  
* I'd also love for you to tell us a little about yourself.
   * [PAUSE FOR PARTICIPANT to introduce themself]  
* Nice to meet you!  
* We do have a couple other team members in the waiting room who would like to observe and help take notes. But before we invite them, I'd like to tell you more about what we're doing today.  
* The subject of our research today is the sign in process on VA.gov. We are not testing your ability.  
* Today we're going to talk about how you sign in to access and manage VA benefits and health care for the Veteran you care for.  
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. The goal is to improve this process to better meet Veterans needs. We will not be offended by any opinions you express, and we welcome your candid feedback.  
* A bit later on, I’ll ask you to interact with a prototype. Just to prepare you for that, it will look real, but it won't be, and we won’t be accessing your account or real information. We use prototypes to help us test things before we decide what to make real.  
* This entire session will take no more than 45 minutes.  
* I do want you to be as comfortable as possible, so if for any reason and at any time you want to pause or even stop the session, please let me know.  
* Any questions so far?
---

* Ok, let’s get to the folks we have waiting to join the session. Perigean did previously ask for your consent to allow other people to observe today, but I know things can change. So I'd like to confirm with you now \- are you okay with a couple of additional observers joining us during this session?  
  * \[If NO\]: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.  
  * \[If YES\]: Admit observers.  
* Let’s have each of our observers quickly go around and introduce themselves with cameras on, please.  
  * \[PAUSE for observers to introduce themselves\]  
* Ok and now I’ll ask our notetakers and observers to mute themselves and turn off their cameras for the remainder of the sessions to save on distractions and to save Zoom bandwidth.  
* We sometimes use written quotes from our notes to help others at the VA understand why we want to make certain changes, but your name and information will not be directly linked to any of your comments. Are you comfortable with that?  
* I'd also like to ask your permission to record our discussion today. This helps us if we need to look back for clarifications like to make sure we noted your opinions correctly. We delete recordings after we finish analysis, which usually takes a couple weeks. Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and our audio as we talk today?  
  * \[IF YES \- RECORD TO CLOUD\]  
  * Now that we're recording, I have to confirm once more \- are you are ok if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?  
* \[WAIT FOR RESPONSE\]  
* Ok, that's it for set up\! Do you have any questions on any of this setup stuff before we start?
