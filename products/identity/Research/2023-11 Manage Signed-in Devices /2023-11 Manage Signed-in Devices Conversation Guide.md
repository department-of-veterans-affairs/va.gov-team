## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

Today we're going to talk about Managing the Devices with which you log into VA.gov.


Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers.
   - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
   - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.
   - Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
- **Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences?** One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.
   - Knowing this, **would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?**
   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**


## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

- When signing into VA.gov, what devices do you use?  (If participant hesitates, give them time to answer without providing examples.  If they are unable to answer, ask them which device they used the last time they signed into VA.gov.
   - Follow that up with "Do you ever sign into VA.gov with anything other than your _______?"
- Have you ever connected any other devices to your VA.gov account e.g. an apple watch or FitBit?  Can you walk me through how you've done that?

## First Task: Signing into VA.gov - 5 minutes (Understanding password management)

- How do you normally access VA.gov?  Can you share your screen with me and walk me through that process?
   - MOBILE DEVICE: [If they are able to access VA.gov without signing in...] How often do you have to enter your username and password to get into the VA.gov website?  Have you ever had any difficulty with signing in? 
- Have you ever manually signed out of your account?  If so, can you show me how?
  - Do you ever sign back in after signing out? Can you describe that for me?
- How do you keep track of your password for signing into your VA account?
   - Have you ever had to reset your password? Can you describe that process for me?
- Have you ever logged into a website like your bank or Facebook from both your phone and computer or another device at the same time?
   - Are there any security concerns with this?
   - [If yes] What do you think those concerns might be?
- Some services online register where you sign in from and let you know if your account has been signed in from a device or even a location that is unusual for you. Have you ever gotten a notice like this, from any service?
   - If so, what did you think? What did you do (if anything)?
- Have you ever had the need to sign out a device when you didn't have access to it? This could be on any service, not just VA, and for any reason. If so, can you recall why you did? Can you describe the steps you took?
   - In the past have you used an option to sign out a single device?
   - What about an option to sign out of all devices that are currently signed in?
   - Do you feel like there is a difference between these two options or has there been a difference in how you've used them in the past?

### Things to watch for:

- Since we're working with users who may be using a desktop browser or a mobile device and each has their own session lengths, we'd like to understand what pain points might arise if they sign out of their devices so the questions on this section are purposely kept more open ended and generative.  Where possible, ask follow-up questions and allow the Veteran to express potential pain points without leading them.

## Second Task: Prototype Walk-Through - 10 minutes

- I'm now going to show you a prototype. This is a website design that we are thinking about using. It may look like the real VA.gov but it is not real, so everything might not work like you are used to. Your thoughts and ideas about this will help us know how we can make it better.
   - [Desktop prototype link](https://www.figma.com/proto/gHOZKVka8PnVblchp0dZbJ/Logout-Device?type=design&node-id=1301-88&t=fmuY0h4DhYNhuRKR-0&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1301%3A88&show-proto-sidebar=1)
   - [Mobile prototype link](https://www.figma.com/proto/gHOZKVka8PnVblchp0dZbJ/Logout-Device?type=design&node-id=1311-54&t=fmuY0h4DhYNhuRKR-0&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1311%3A54&show-proto-sidebar=1)
- Let's pretend that you got a notification from the VA of a sign-in to your account, and that you don't recognize it, or you don't think it was you signing in.
    - How would you expect to recieve a notification like this? [email, text, multiple ways?]
    - Would you do anything with this information?
       - If you wouldn't take any action based on this notification, what might you expct to happen?
    - If you decided to take action, what would you do? [pause]
       - [If they don't respond with VA.gov]... Would you go to VA.gov to sign into to your acount?
- I would like for you to share your screen now and walk me through how you would complete the following steps.  I'm going to share with you a prototype that you can use to walk me through so that you are not having to share your actual information.
   - [Mobile screen share help](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/iphone-start-screen-share)
   - [Desktop screen share help](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362153-Sharing-your-screen-or-desktop-on-Zoom)
- Can you show me what you would do once signed into VA.gov after the receiving the notification?  Why would you start there?
   - **Username** page
      - [SUCCESS] (selects username > profile OR "go to your profile") Allow them to continue walking you through.
      - [FAIL] (explores other options) Ask them why they chose that area prior to guiding them to their profile. "Thanks for sharing that thought.  However, we'll start with navigating to your profile."
   - **Profile** page
     - Can you tell me what you would be looking for on this page at this point?  Does anything stand out to you to help you commplete your task?
     - [SUCCESS] (sees the "Account Security" option) Allow them to continue walking you through.
     - [FAIL] (if they don't call out "Account Security") ask them to read through the page again; if they are unable to point out "Manage Devices", prompt them for what they're looking for.
         - What word or phrase would you be looking for in order to complete the task of signing out of all your devices.
         - What do you think the term "Account Security" means on this page?
         - For today, we'll navigate to the "Account Security" portion on this page.
   - **Manage Devices** page
      - Can you walk me through what you're seeing here?
      - What would you do next?
      - What do you think about when seeing the button "sign out" next to each device? What would happen if you clicked, "sign out of all devices"?
         -  [Does the Veteran understand the implication of having to sign back into their account the next time?] 
      - Have you ever done this or something simlar on another app or website? Can you tell me about that?
   - **Connected Apps**
      - What do you think this phrase means? 

### Things to watch for:

- [Does the participant understand meaning of signing out of all of their devices?]
- [Does the participant notice the warning indicator?]
- [Etc]


## Post-Task Interview - X minutes

- Sometimes it takes a while to develop and code changes that we want to make. If we could quickly put up the "sign out all" button while we work on the rest of what we showed you today, would you find that useful?
- Is there any additional feedback you have for me at this point?
- Any questions for me? 

## Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
   - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?


## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
