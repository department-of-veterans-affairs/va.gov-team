## Topline Take-aways

- Some veterans who do not agree with or understand the need to change their CMS may become averse to doing so.
- Some veterans may not understand the inherited verification process - that if they've already been verified the account creation process for login.gov has few steps
- Some veterans have issues with their current CMS, whether it's MHV, DS, login.gov, or ID.me
   - Some veterans having issues with their CMS attribute that to a VA issue, even when the CMS is not owned by VA
- Some veterans may have a technological proficiency barier to a more secure CMS.
   - Many other veterans stick up for those even when they are more technology proficient themselves

Not Identity team related
- Some veterans post their needs or frustrations with or seek information from the VA on these posts, even when it's a completely unrelated topic.
   - Some of those seem to expect a response from the VA, while others seem to be moreso screaming into the void.


## Analysis Goals
Better understand some of veterans’ frustrations with logging in and credentialing.


## Methodology 

Some veterans use the comment section of VA news (or blog) posts to express their feelings on that particular topic. The comments were posted publically on a publically accessible page of VA.gov. This is potentially valuable data, as long as we understand the limitations of this data source. Consider, this source *isn’t statistically significant*, nor does it adequately represent the veteran population, as only those who read the post and then are most vocal or stirred to write about it will leave a comment.
   
The particular post of consideration is [Login.gov Provides Access to VA Digital Products, Services](https://news.va.gov/114076/login-gov-access-va-digital-products-services/) which uses video and text to introduce login.gov as a sign in option for the VA ecosystem. Of note this post doesn’t mention other VA sign in options going away.


## Key Analysis Points

Although the categories listed here don’t claim to be exhaustive or exclusionary of other possible categories, during analysis the collected comments were classified into the following categories:

1. Number of account credential options
-The comments in this category relate to being overwhelmed or otherwise frustrated at the number of credentialing option available
- “WE don’t want more accounts and log-ins.”
- “How many freaking Logins are going to keep being the ONLY one that I need?”
- “This is so effing convoluted! I signed into Myhealthevet and had no problems until, Login.gov, IDme.gov Login.gov. DoD.gov.”
   - This comment, along with some others, go a step further and assign blame to the new credentialing options. Adoption of a new credentialing system will likely be difficult for a segment of veterans who are so negative towards a new CMS that it becomes aversion, since aversion is difficult to overcome.

2. Requirements to switch credentialing systems
- These comments relate the desire to keep their current credential option
- “I like signing in to MyHealtheVet as it is.”
- “I have no problems with the Health Vet login so please leave it alone.”

3. Required information or documentation to verify account
- A known issue is the difficulty with taking the ID picture. This was brought up several times. Also included in this category are other frustrations with what is needed, and frustration about feeling this is a repeat process.
- “I have tried this several times, but the photo always fails to send…”
- “I do not have a drivers license, a passport. or any other form of ID except my Veterans Healthcare Card.”
- "Why ask for SS number. Last four is all I need for most things I access."
- “ I have been verified by MYhealthevet, I have been verifed, in person, at my VAMC and now I have to reverify an account I’ve had for years?”
   - Since many veterans who have a verified account should be able to inherit proof, this comment might indicate a misunderstanding of the process

4. General credential system issues
- Some of these comments appear to be issues with either DS login or MHV, others are unclear. These are issues where veterans are unable to access using their currently preferred credentialing method
- “every time I try to sign in…they want me to change my PW.. whats up with that..”
- “I BEEN LOCKED OUT FOR OVER FIVE MONTHS AND COUNTING”
- “Neither ID.ME or myHealtheVet (i am registered and have passwords for each) will login reliably.”

5. Login.gov’s ease (or difficulty) of use
- Several commenters mentioned issues specifically signing in with login.gov
- “Login.gov is definitely not easy to use. On Monday I spent four hours signing on, being kicked off, redirected and cut off.”
- “it doesn’t work all the time”

6. Multi factor authentication issues
- The comments in this section relate to frustrations with MFA
- “When I finally got through I could not receive a text with a stupid code to continue. I tried many many times. I tried again days later. Not without a ton of effort did I finally get through.”
- “Every time it has me enter a verification code, I go back to retrieve it from my phone and I go back to enter it , it makes me start all over in an endless loop”

7. Technology proficiency and accessibility concerts
- Several commenters mentioned that other veterans or themselves have technology proficiency concerns.
- “You have no idea what some people have to go through just to use tech. It is not easy.”
- “Many of our veterans can not keep up with the constant change of todays technology. I’m in my seventies and I struggle with my flip phone.”
- “All vets are not ITs or computer literate. Make the system easier!!!!”

8. Workarounds
- When unable to log in, veterans employ various workarounds and propose others
- “CAN’T GET ONLINE, HAVE TO GO IN PERSON”
- One veteran told a story about getting a letter from the VA in the states, but being unable to login had to get a family member to mail it to him overseas.
- “NEED LIVE IN PERSON PHONE HELP TO GET LOGIN.GOV TO WORK”
   - This shows that some veterans prefer live phone help to other methods, including chatbots

9. General frustrations
- “So please just identify me as ‘FRUSTRATED’.”
- “The new process is worse than being hacked.”

10. Comments not directly related to the login or credentialing process
- While important in their own way, 11 of the comments seemed off topic to identity, credentialing, and logging in and were set aside


## Further research possibilities

Some areas that might benefit from further research based on this analysis of comments
- For those who have a negative impression of the newer CMS (login.gov and ID.me), is their any information or explination that would change their mind of the need to switch CMS?
- How can the VA best ensure veterans understand that these CMSs are no managed by VA, so for example, they understand to seek help from them and not from VA.
