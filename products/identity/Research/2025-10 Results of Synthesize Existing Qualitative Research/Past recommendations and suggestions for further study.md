## [2023-02 Desk Research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/e8f3f06171c9fd268bb0fd67823a05535d766553/products/identity/Research/2023-02%20Desk%20Research) - Product - verification  
Further study recommended
* What process do users of devices with less than a 8MP camera go through to be able to verify their account? Is there a significantly different burden for that process?  
* Further research the difference between types of device users verify with and the issues they run into  
  * Apple device vs other device brand users  
  * Tablet device vs phone device users

## [2023-04 Proactive CSP Migration](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/e8f3f06171c9fd268bb0fd67823a05535d766553/products/identity/Research/2023-04%20Proactive%20CSP%20Migration/2023-04%20Proactive%20CSP%20Migration%20research%20findings.md) - Products - verification, MFA, CSPs  

Further study recommended
* Conduct more research on how to communicate the concept of "verified account" or "ID proofed" credentials.

Study recommendations that we should consider if we’ve done and/or still want

* Better educate veterans about MFA options other than SMS  
* Better label Login.gov as a partner, not part of VA

## [2023-11 Manage Signed-in Devices](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/e8f3f06171c9fd268bb0fd67823a05535d766553/products/identity/Research/2023-11%20Manage%20Signed-in%20Devices) - Products - manage devices, fraud, security  
Study recommendations that we should consider if we’ve done and/or still want

* Research on how we might align how the “manage devices” feature can be leveraged to protect account security (alongside features like changing your password and etc.)  
* Gather metrics and conduct further research to identify future features

Other thoughts

* Decide if we want to move forward with this work as part of SiS or Fraud work


## [2023-06 Mocked Authentication](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/e8f3f06171c9fd268bb0fd67823a05535d766553/products/identity/Research/2023-06%20Mocked%20Authentication) - Products - mocked Auth, identity dashboard  
Further study recommended

* Conduct additional user testing to gather feedback and iterate on the identity dashboard's design and functionality

Study recommendations that we should consider if we’ve done and/or still want

* Evaluate the documentation for creating new mocked users. Participants found it confusing and hard to follow.  
* Explore the possibility of adding a feature for creating new mocked users directly in the dashboard.  
* Continue to iterate on error messaging and navigation, particularly the “back” button flow after error screens.


## [2023-07 Terms of Use](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/e8f3f06171c9fd268bb0fd67823a05535d766553/products/identity/Research/2023-07%20Terms%20of%20Use/2023-08%20Terms%20of%20use%20research%20findings.md) - Product - terms of use

Study recommendations that we should consider if we’ve done and/or still want
* offering an additional warning on selecting “decline” before being signed out
