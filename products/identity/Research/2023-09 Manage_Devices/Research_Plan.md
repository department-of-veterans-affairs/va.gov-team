# Research Plan for Identity, Manage Devices, 2023-9

## Background
Currently, users are logged out after 30 minutes of inactivity on the VA.gov website on the desktop browser.  When using a mobile device, a user's session is maintained for 45 days.  With the current setup, the risks associated with being logged into multiple devices is minimal.  However, once SiS is pushed to production, a user's session on the desktop will also be maintained for 45 days, significantly increasing the security concerns e.g. phishing, malware, and other threats.


### OCTO Objectives 

- Veterans and their families can apply for all benefits online
- Veterans can manage their health services online
- Veterans and their families trust the security, accuracy, and relevancy of VA.gov


### Veteran Journey

Securely accessing VA online services can happen at any stage in the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf). The option to log out of all devices will apply to every who signs into VA online and uses the authenticated experience.

## Research Goals	

- Explore Veterans' knowledge of personal device management as well as management of concurrent sessions on multiple devices.
- Explore Veterans' understanding of the use cases for device management and the security implications of multiple active sessions on various devices. 
- Test the user flow for how a Veteran would access device management and logging out of multiple devices at once.

### Outcome

Learn how to effectively communicate to the Veterans the need for device management as well as to uncover how to improve the user experience with various audiences as they navigate through the flow for managing their devices and active logged in sessions.

### Research questions

- What information (copy versions) would allow users to make an informed choice to leverage the sign out of all devices option?
- Are there any potential concerns about ending sessions and logging people out of their accounts on all devices? (Review previous research on stickiness of sessions).
- Are there a additional language and design options that should be taken into consideration?
- Does the prototype allow users to successfully navigate to and utilize the proposed user flow for managing their devices?
- What updates to the user flow could we incorporate to make it more intuitive for Veterans?
- Is there any confusion regarding connected applications, connected devices and device management?


### Hypothesis

- Veterans will be split on their understanding of a rationale for logging out of all devices.
- Most Veterans will never have used the option of signing out of all of their devices on other websites.
- Veterans will need an explanation of the implications of signing out of all their devices in order to make an informed decision to proceed.
- Veterans will expect the platform to take accountability for their security e.g. if there are suspected instances of malware, phishing scams, etc. the VA.gov website will automatically end all user sessions and inform the Veteran.
- Veterans are willing to sacrifice security for convenience of not having to log back into their devices.

## Methodology	

Remote usability testing will evaluate the prototype with participants. We’ll use Perigean’s Zoom account for these remote sessions. We plan to test with both mobile and desktop users and with assistive tech users.

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach

We will use Perigean to recruit Veterans for this moderated study. We are looking to include as participants some historically under represented groups for this:

- Assistive Tech users (screen zoom, and screen reader in particular)
- Mobile users
- Cognitive disabilities

### Recruitment criteria

15 Veterans for at least 12 completed sessions

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
All participants:
- Must have a computer or mobile phone and be willing to complete their sessions on this device
- Must be willing to share a web browser window on the Zoom call
- Must have a working microphone
- Must have Zoom downloaded to their computer prior to the session and know how to share their screen
- In addition our primary product criteria includes:
   - Must be Veterans
   - Must have signed into VA.gov in the last 6 months, for any reason
   - 


Our primary diversity and inclusion criteria:
- 5 mobile users (none of these can be screen reader users)
- 8 total desktop users which includes
   - 5 sighted desktop users
   - 3 screen reader users
- 2 cognitive disabilities

We've split these into 3 cohorts
- [Cohort 1: sighted desktop](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/356)
   - 5 computer (desktop or laptop) users of VA.gov
   - 5 who will join the session on desktop or laptop
   - 1 cognitive disability
   - 1 who self-identifies race as other than white
- [Cohort 2: sighted mobile](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/357)
   - 5 mobile users of VA.gov
   - 5 who will join the session on mobile
   - 1 cognitive disability
   - 1 who self-identifies race as other than white
- [Cohort 3: screen reader desktop](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/358)
   - 3 screen reader participants
      - at least 1 who is less experienced using screen reader
      - at least 1 who is more experienced using screen reader 
   - 3 (all) joining session on desktop


### Screener Questions
