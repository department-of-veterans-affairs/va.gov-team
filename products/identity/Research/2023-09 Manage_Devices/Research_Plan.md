# Research Plan for Identity, Manage Devices, 2023-9

## Background
VA would like everyone utilizing VA.gov and it's surrounding sites and services to be presented with a unified version of the Terms and Conditions that they will have to agree to in order to continue utilizing the authenticated experience
- [product info](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity/terms%20and%20conditions)


### OCTO Objectives 

- Veterans and their families can apply for all benefits online
- Veterans can manage their health services online
- Veterans and their families trust the security, accuracy, and relevancy of VA.gov


### Veteran Journey

Securely accessing VA online services can happen at any stage in the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf). The updated Terms of Use will apply to every who signs into VA online and uses the authenticated experience.

## Research Goals	

- Explore Veterans' knowledge of personal device management as well as management of concurrent sessions on multiple devices.
- Explore Veterans' understanding of the use cases for device management and the security implications of multiple active sessions on various devices. 
- Test the user flow for how a Veteran would access device management and logging out of multiple devices at once.

### Outcome

Learn how to effectively communicate to the Veterans the need for device management as well as to uncover how to improve the user experience with various audiences as they navigate through the flow for managing their devices and active logged in sessions.

### Research questions

- What information (copy versions) would allow users to make an informed choice to leverage the sign out of all devices option?
- Are there any potential concerns about ending sessions and logging people out of their accounts on all devices?
- Are there a additional language and design options that should be taken into consideration?
- Does the prototype allow users to successfully navigate to and utilize the proposed user flow for managing their devices?
- What updates to the user flow could we incorporate to make it more intuitive for Veterans?


### Hypothesis

- Veterans will be split on their understanding of a rationale for logging out of all devices.
- Once security concerns are explained to the Veteran, they will understand why such an option exists.
- Veterans will expect the platform to take accountability for their security e.g. if there are suspected instances of malware, phishing scams, etc. the VA.gov website will automatically end all user sessions and inform the Veteran.
- Veterans are willing to sacrifice security for convenience of not having to log back into their devices.

## Methodology	

Remote usability testing will evaluate the prototype with participants. We’ll use Perigean’s Zoom account for these remote sessions. We plan to test with both mobile and desktop users and with assistive tech users.

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach

We will use Perigean to recruit Veterans for this moderated study. We are looking to include as participants some historically under represented groups for this:

- Assistive Tech users (screen zoom, and screen reader in particular)
- Mobile users
- Cognitive disabilities

### Recruitment criteria

- In addition our primary product criteria includes:
   - Must be Veterans

Our primary diversity and inclusion criteria:
- 5 mobile users (none of these can be screen reader users)

   - 5 computer (desktop or laptop) users of VA.gov
   - 5 who will join the session on desktop or laptop
   - 1 cognitive disability
   - 1 who self-identifies race as other than white

   - 5 mobile users of VA.gov
   - 5 who will join the session on mobile
   - 1 cognitive disability
   - 1 who self-identifies race as other than white
- [Cohort 3: screen reader desktop](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/358)
   - 3 screen reader participants
      - at least 1 who is less experienced using screen reader
      - at least 1 who is more experienced using screen reader 
   - 3 (all) joining session on desktop
