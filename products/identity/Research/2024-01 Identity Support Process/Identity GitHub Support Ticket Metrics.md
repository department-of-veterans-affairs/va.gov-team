## Platform GitHub Support - Dashboard

**Platform Support GitHub Ticket & Support Satisfaction Survey Domo Dashboard**

- The GitHub dataset comes from a data set in BigQuery, powered by data related to GitHub requests. 

- The columns the dataset has are open_date, platform_teams, creator, close_date, label_value, ticket_rank, assignees, days_to_close, ticket_number, title, body, all labels, URL, milestone_number, milestone, state, update_date, BATCH_ID, and Batch_last_run.

- BigQuery DB used: BQ - Github issues 2

- The dataset for the survey portion of that dashboard is manually updated once a week. 
- The survey flows into Optimal Workshop where I export the current dataset and input it into Domo. 
- It is essentially an excel file that feeds a dataset (with some ETL work) (edited) 



The following is from VA Platform Support

The new Platform Feedback survey in Slack empowers VFS team members to directly provide information about issues related to Platform products and services as they encounter them. This real-time feedback mechanism enables the Platform to swiftly identify and address problematic issues. VFS team members are encouraged to share their pain points, frustrations, compliments, and suggestions, contributing to a better work environment.

Here’s how to give feedback in Slack:

From the Bookmark in #vfs-platform-support:
Navigate to the #vfs-platform-support channel in Slack.
Locate the Platform Feedback bookmark at the top of the channel (see images below).
Click on the bookmark to open the survey in Slack.
Fill out the survey and submit!

For Power Users! From Within Any Channel:
Simply start typing “/platformfeedback” in any channel.
Click on the Platform Feedback workflow highlight when it appears.
This summons the same feedback form without leaving your current channel.
Why might VFS team members want to give feedback about the Platform?
By providing feedback as they encounter issues, VFS team members help uncover blockers. These could include:
Specific processes that are slow, flawed, or need improvement.
Outdated documentation that requires updates.
Not finding a resource
Not locating or receiving the help needed to understand something
Who sees the information?
Platform’s Service Design Team (SDT) analyzes the collected data from submissions to present to Platform leadership and Platform teams for measuring progress and guiding improvements.

## VA Chatbot KPIs

About the Chatbot Medallia Survey = Survey is not deployed at random, meaning users must actively seek it out in order to submit a response. In general, this may lead to more negative responses than an intercept survey would provide, as only users who have had negative experiences will attempt to provide feedback.

﻿
- Date range – Grouped by month, shows the most recent complete month.
    - NOTE: Chatbot launched in March 2022, but some metrics related to engagement only available from November 2022 onward, when "Start Chat" button tagging was implemented.
﻿
