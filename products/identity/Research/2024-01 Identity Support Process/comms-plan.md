## Slack Notification

**Attention:** Identity team has a new support Slackbot

**What's happening:** Starting on April TBD, VA teams will [request support from the Identity team through our new Slackbot](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Support%20Process/Identity-Slackbot-documentation.md). This includes any questions about [user authentication](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/authentication) for VA.gov and its services and tools.

To get help from our team:

- Navigate to [#vsp-identity](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/CSFV4QTKN).
- Type the [/identity-support] command.
- Select your issue type.
- Provide more details and review self-service documentation.

**Impact:** use the Slackbot for new requests going forward. An engineer or product manager will follow up on the request within 1 business day. Urgent requests impacting Veterans on production servers will get a response within 1 hour.

**Documentation:** review our [Github documentation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Support%20Process/Identity-Slackbot-documentation.md) for details on how to submit a new support request.
