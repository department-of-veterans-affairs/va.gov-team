## Background
To understand core concepts of Sign-in Service (SiS) and the task flow new teams need to complete to set it up for their application, we completed a demo with our engineering team to walk through setting up SiS. After initial findings were shared, the team was invited to write definitions for key concepts, brainstorm nuances teams need to understand for different authentication types, and write up "elevator pitch" dialogs to explain what SiS is to another person or team.

1. SiS demo: setting up authentication for a new application (for each flow)
2. Share out of findings: feedback on initial task flow diagram
3. Team concept brainstorm: writing definitions for key terms, writing "elevator pitches" to explain what SiS is to another team 
4. Refining and finalizing task flow: follow up questions with engineers to walk through the steps of determining your authentication type and registering your service configuration or client configuration

The outputs included clarified langauge and definitions for key concepts and a task flow for new developers determining the right authentication flow and setting up their client configuration or service configuration. Developer documentation was also updated to reflect the authentication flows clarified during the work.

This research contributed to the MVP deliverables for the Sign-in Service onboarding project. Deliverables served as source artifacts for how we talk about SiS and what teams need to know and understand.

## Research Goals:
- Align the language we use for SiS onboarding
- Clarify what information developers need to know and understand
- Creating alignment internally on how we define key concepts
- Confirming and simplifying the different authentication flow types
