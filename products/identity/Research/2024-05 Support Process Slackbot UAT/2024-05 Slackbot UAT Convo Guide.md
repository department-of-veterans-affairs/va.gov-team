# Slackbot UAT - Conversation Guide

## Starting the Session | 3 min

Thank you for taking some time with us today!

[Intro self and team]

We asked you to chat and test out a flow for requesting identity support, because you’d recently posted in the VSP-Identity slack channel asking for support from our team. Our team has been working on a more formal process to field support requests to help make sure all are addressed in a timely manner.

A couple of points before we get started
- We'll ask you to do a task, but we aren’t testing you or your abilities. You're helping us test a possible solution
- We want to hear your honest opinions. We welcome and appreciate your candid feedback.
- In case we have any questions with our notes we need to check, we’d like to record our chat today. Are you ok if we start recording?

## Intention setting Q’s | 5 min

- I'd like to start off by getting an understanding of your thoughts as you needed to make a request to my team. Can you take me through your thinking about when you made a request in VSP-Identity
   - Anything from where you went, what you looked at or looked for, who you asked, what you asked and such?
      - Would you ever search Google? a team's Slack Docs? for that type of question?
      - Do you ever seek information on a teams Canvas page?
   - It doesn’t have to be perfectly chronological, but I’d especially like to hear anything that starts with you and your team discovering you needed some Identity support to having that support request resolved or fulfilled.
   - [other follow-ups as needed]
- If you need help or support from another team how do you figure out how to initiate that?
   - [if need more discussion can talk about Platform process]


Thanks for filling in that context

## Activity | 10 min
[UAT test cases](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Products/Request%20&%20Support%20Process/UAT_MVP.md)
- Now we’d like for you to take us through how you might request support in the new process.
- At this point we’ll ask that you share your screen, and in particular we are interested in seeing your Slack window. You can bring up the VSP-Identity channel if you want to make sure you don’t have any private or sensitive channels showing.
   - [if would search Canvas or team docs, then use that as the prompt:]
      - Let's say you saw slackbot in our Canvas, and it says for support from Identtiy to use the `/identity-support` command
         - Is that a clear instruction?
         - What would make it more understandable?
   - [if would post right in channel without searching our docs or Canvas, then use the following]
      - Let say that you started in the same way you did last time - going to VSP-Identity channel and message a request. Someone then asks you to use the slash command to request through the slackbot. 
         - Is that a clear instruction?
         - What would make it more understandable?

Ok, so go ahead and use VSP-Identtiy channel to type in the slash command. Let’s say you are need the same support as the last time you requested support from Identity. <br>
[if don’t remember, then any type of support that would make sense for their team]

[As they look through the first drop down]<br>
Can you explain to me what you are are thinking when you see each of these drop down options?

[after submitting the ticket]
- I’m going to have you go to another screen now, if you are in the General or Random channels either of those would be fine, or any channel that’s ok to have up on screen while we are recording.
- Ok so we’ll imaging that some time has gone by and you want to check in on the support request that you made. Where are you going to look first?
   - If Slack - did you realize that a GitHub ticket was created for you?
   - If GH - if you’ve ever used Platform support, do you always look back to GH?
- If you have additional questions or context you want to add to an issue, where would you address that?
   - [maybe in GitHub or the Slack thread?]
- What should happen when a ticket is closed?
   - [Does you get notified in Slack or is the ticket simply closed (and by whom)?]

We would like you to submit one other request type while we have you.<br>
[choose another of the request types, DON'T CHOOSE SIS]


## Wrap-up | 10 min

- Does anyone one else on my team have any questions?
- Does [participant] have any questions for our team?
- We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Thank you, and enjoy the rest of your day!
