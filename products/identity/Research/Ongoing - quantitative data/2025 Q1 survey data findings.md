## Background
This research considered the Medallia intercept survey, Medallia feedback survey, and the MyVA411 Call Center data from January 1, 2025 to March 30, 2025. This is part of our team's regular checkin with quantitatitve data.


## Methodology 

We requested survey data for January thru March the Contact Center Team in April. This time we did not analylize call center data in depth, but only used readily accessible data from DOMO. We used 44 tag optionsto organize each entry. Entries that were clear duplicates or had no information in them are excluded.

* Medallia feedback survey - folks get to this by pressing the "feedback" button at the bottom of a page on VA.gov
  * We pulled data from surveys that were started on pages that are owned by our team or related to identity and sign in products, especially including resource pages
  * To assess sentiment, we primarily used the question “Please rate your experience with VA.gov today.” We mostly rated scores of 4 or 5 as positive, scores of 3 as neutral, and scores of 1 or 2 as negative.  
  * There were some exceptions made where the open field question “why did you select this rating” didn’t match. Since the goal here is to capture sentiment of sign in products, if a higher score was given but sign in was mentioned negatively in the open field, then the sentiment was adjusted down, and so forth. Another exception was in a couple of cases when no rating was left on the experience question, but open text data and the other questions were rated in a way that offered insight on the person’s sentiment. In those few cases we added a sentiment rating to match the other survey questions.
* Medallia intercept survey - folks get to this by seeing a pop-up on screen
    * We pulled data from surveys that were started on pages that are owned by our team or related to identity and sign in products 
    * To assess sentiment, we only used the question “what is your overall satisfaction with this site.” With scores on the 5 point scale, 4 and 5 were counted as positive, scores of 3 were rated neutral, and scores of 1 or 2 were rated negative.  
  * We gave no research finesse to this or other data on this survey data.
* MyVA411 data  
  * This data comes to us pre-classified with a Category and Type. These have some relevance for our team and do correlate with the researcher tags added. The Subject data we get for each record is limited, but sometimes offers enough information that the researcher applied tag doesn't follow the Category or Type.
  * In this way, some Category or Types have a more correlation to researcher tags than others.  
  * Because the Subject is open text added by the call center representative, there is some althogh minimal risk of PII.
  * There is further ticket data that we could ask for, but it would be highly likely to include PII so this would be a special request. Also with over 14,000 tickets it is already a lot of data to parse even without this.

**Top Tasks (Intercept Survey)**  
| Task Tag               | Count | % Responses |
|------------------------|-------|-------------|
| CSP transition         | 389   | 29.3%       |
| Set up account         | 213   | 16.0%       |
| Issue - unable to sign in | 212 | 16.0%       |

### MyVA411 call data
There were 24,823 calls related to authentication from the call center. This includes 6 categories of cases.
- Identity Verification Issues: 9,523 calls, with Login.gov being the most common issue (64.8% of these calls).
- Navigation Issues: 5,922 calls, primarily related to Account Sign in (73.9%).
- Inability to Sign In: 5,670 calls, with two-factor authentication being the main issue (72.2%).
- Forgot Password: 2,179 calls, with roughly equal issues for ID.me (42.8%) and Login.gov (43.6%). DS Logon had 8.7% of the forgot password calls, while it only had about 5% of total authentications during this time. This likely indicates that more DS Logon users are experiencing issues with passwords.
- Sign in and Technical Issues: 917 calls, mostly about signing into VA.gov and managing profiles (98.36%).
- Security Total: 612 calls, primarily about Account Sign in (98.37%).

VAgov's Medallia Intercept Data for February and March 2025 shows a significant increase in total responses over the same months in the prior year and over the previous period of October and November 2024

* Negative, neutral responses both increased  over prior periods  
* Positive responses remained relatively stable compared to February/March 2024\.  
* Negative responses increased by about 470% from both prior periods, a large increase during the final weeks of the MHV account deprecation.  
* Since positive responses remained about the same, while negative responses increased substantially, there is a net negative effect on the rating

VAgov's Medallia Feedback Data for February and March 2025 shows a significant increase in total responses regarding the ability to complete tasks compared over the same months in the prior year and over the previous period of October and November 2024

* Both the number of users reporting they were unable to complete their task and the number of users reporting they were able to complete their task increased substantially  
* The net result is that roughly the same percentage of people were able to complete there task, compared to the prior period, and that a slightly higher percentage of folks were able to complete based on the prior year.  
* This is a good sign that even though responses went up, task completion percentage remained the same, or was better than prior reporting periods.


### Themes from Qualitative Data

#### Account Setup and Verify Issues
- Wrong or shared email address
- Verification fails due to new or unverified phone number
- Caregivers setting up accounts for Veterans
- Photo ID upload issues (e.g., no ID, digital access limits)
- Accessibility needs (vision, dexterity)

#### Verify Loop
- Users feel stuck in a verification cycle
- Some verified multiple times but system asks again
- Triggers include the `/verify` page and MHV prompts
- Described as repeated license scans or failure to retain verification status

#### Technical Issues
- Timeout problems
- “Stay signed in” button not working
- Kicked out on Rx page (sign-in loop)
- Sign-in page won’t load (“spinning wheel”)
- Most common on mobile or MHV-related pages
- Biometric login issues, especially mobile

### Content and UI Flags
- Uncertainty around:
  - Linking new accounts to VA
  - Where to sign in
  - Whether account is valid for March 4
- Confusion from:
  - Incomplete redirect from CSP to VA
  - Content showing “create account” but not “sign in”
- Users want to “verify” but are routed to “learn more” articles
- Terminology issues (e.g., "MFA" unclear)


## Recommendations

**Account Setup and Verify Issues**
- Consider additional research
- Collaborate with CSP partners

**Verify Loop**
- Continue monitoring for perceived loops
- Spike to investigate and resolve technical causes

**Technical Issues**
- Investigate timeout problems
- Monitor Rx page behavior as transition completes
- Identify ISP/device-specific issues

**Content and UI**
- Share insights with platform content team
- Improve wayfinding to sign-in related actions

## Survey quotes

### Sign in error

* "Login to my healthy vet using my ID me account, I get a error code 500 all the time and cannot login"  
* "I often get an error code "500". Other times I get into a loop that asks me to sign in. I get various failures due to an apparent system overload."

Try again later, or contact the app or website owner. If you provide content to customers through CloudFront, you can find steps to troubleshoot and help prevent this error by reviewing the CloudFront documentation."

### Verify loop

* IDme  
  * existing account “Tried to sign in thru MyHealth.va.gov using my existing ( and it works just fine for all my other govt agency access topics ) id.me account.. afterwards Id.me sends me back to VA, who says they are going to verify my details and they send me back to id.me, after about 4 iterations of this, i gave up.”  
  * "each time I try to login in, it requests that I go through the entire process of signing in, starting with my driver's license, etc."  
  * "Completed all steps and each time I try to log in, the system takes me back to the verification part of the process"  
  * \[has to verify multiple times\] "I have verified my va.gov steps 3x and uploaded all information (including drivers license), but every time I try to log in, it makes me do the steps again"  
  * "I've verified FIVE times and it keeps cycling back to verify. I had a message that it was successfully completed."  
  * "Login with id.me account and I was then asked to verify identity which has already been done to get the id.me account "  
  * "When I try to get the va account I am told to verify identity and get sent back to login and round and round I go. Infinite do loop."  
  * \[maybe the /verify page or the MHV notification?\] "i re-verified my identity on the id.me webpage; the webpage shared my identity with the va; going back to the va pages and it tells me i have to verify my identity."  
* LIG  
  * "Went thru the identity process, got to the end and was told I had to go thru it again."
