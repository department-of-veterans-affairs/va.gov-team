## Background
- Review and analyze Medallia feedback related to the /verify page to identify potential friction, error patterns, or user frustrations. This analysis will help us better understand how users are interacting with the page, especially as traffic increases through VEO emails, interstitials, or USiP flows. 


## Methodology 

We requested survey data for May and June from the Contact Center Team. Since there were no surveys taken from the /verify page, we recieved surveys from pages about verify, mostly from resource pages like [https://www.va.gov/resources/verifying-your-identity-on-vagov/](https://www.va.gov/resources/verifying-your-identity-on-vagov/)

* Medallia feedback survey - folks get to this by pressing the "feedback" button at the bottom of a page on VA.gov
* Medallia intercept survey - folks get to this by seeing a pop-up on screen
* We asked for surveys that were started from va.gov/verify and pages related to verify content
  * No results retuend from /verify, so this analysis relies only on resource pages about verify

 
## Key data points
Comments were largely in a few categories - technical errors verifying including ID upload issues or general complaints of MFA, sign in, or MHV site changes. There wasn’t anything that seemed related to our focus on this work of the /verify page.


## Secondary findings
- 1 called out issues verifying in Philippine’s
- 4 mentioned not having a smart phone
- 4 mention that either Logingov or ID.me asked them to verify for a 3rd time (had already done ID submission 2 previously)
   - Other mentions alluded to needing to verify more than once, but didn’t state it quite so plainly or mention a CSP
- 1 mention of having LoginGov for SSA, but it doesn’t work for VA
- 2 mentions of being under 18, so not able to verify with either CSP

## Recommendations
No recommendations can be offered around the /verify page since no data here was about this page
