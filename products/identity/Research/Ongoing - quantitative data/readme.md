# About this Research

- [Product Outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity/login#product-outline-vagov--mobile-app-login)

## Background
We want to regularly check in on qualitative data. This will help us uncover painpoints and other areas of improvement in our products and give us a view of how our products are doing overall. 

## Planned Timeline
About every quarter we plan to request new survey and support data from the Veteran Support (aka Contact Center team)
