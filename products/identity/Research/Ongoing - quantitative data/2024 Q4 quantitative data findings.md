## Background
This research considered the Medallia intercept survey, Medallia feedback survey, and the MyVA411 Call Center data from October 1, 2024 to November 30, 2025. This is part of our team's regular checkin with quantitatitve data.


## Methodology 

We requested data from the Contact Center Team in December, in preparation for the holidays, so this "quarter" view only includes October and November. A researcher went through and tagged entries with 39 tag options. Often more than one tag was applied to a given entry. Entries that were clear duplicates or had no information in them were excluded. We calculated the researcher applied tags, each individual data set’s relevant data to come away with findings.

* Medallia feedback survey - folks get to this by pressing the "feedback" button at the bottom of a page on VA.gov
  * We pulled data from surveys that were started on pages that are owned by our team or related to identity and sign in products
  * To assess sentiment, we primarily used the question “Please rate your experience with VA.gov today.” We mostly rated scores of 4 or 5 as positive, scores of 3 as neutral, and scores of 1 or 2 as negative.  
  * There were some exceptions made where the open field question “why did you select this rating” didn’t match in some kind of way. Since the goal here is to capture sentiment of sign in products, if a higher score was given but sign in was mentioned negatively in the open field, then the sentiment was adjusted down, and so forth. Another exception was in a couple of cases when no rating was left on the experience question, but the other questions were rated in a way that offered insight on the person’s sentiment. In that case we would add a sentiment rating that wasn't based off the response to the survey question about experience.
* Medallia intercept survey - folks get to this by seeing a pop-up on screen
    * We pulled data from surveys that were started on pages that are owned by our team or related to identity and sign in products 
    * To assess sentiment, we only used the question “what is your overall satisfaction with this site.” With scores on the 5 point scale, 4 and 5 were counted as positive, scores of 3 were rated neutral, and scores of 1 or 2 were rated negative.  
  * We gave no research finesse to this or other data on this survey.
* MyVA411 data  
  * This data comes to us pre-classified with a Category and Type. These have some relevance for our team and do correlate with the researcher tags added. The Subject data we get for each record is limited, but sometimes offers enough information that the researcher applied tag doesn't follow the Category or Type.
  * In this way, some Category or Types have a more correlation to researcher tags than others.  
  * Because the Subject is open text added by the call center representative, there is some althogh minimal risk of PII.
  * There is further ticket data that we could ask for, but it would be highly likely to include PII so this would be a special request. Also with over 14,000 tickets it is already a lot of data to parse even without this.
* Across data type

### Medallia intercept survey
323 total entries were reviewed and 1596 total tags applied  
  * Top tags  
    * unable to sign in, CSP transition, mobile app, set up account

| Top Tasks today (researcher tagged and excluding "sign in") | Number | Percent of responses |
| :---- | ----- | ----- |

  * Other items of interest  
    * Several mentions each of \`MFA\`, of their task today being to \`seek information\` about the credential migration, or of trying to \`verify\` and in particular \`verify \- ID pic\`  
  * 676 site satisfaction feedback scores were made  
    * 581 or 86% of the entries were negative

| Total | 789 |  |

  * The folks responding to this survey felt overwhelmingly negative sentiment towards and were overwhelmingly not able to accomplish what they wanted to do that visit. Of particular note are not being able to sign in, frustrations with the credential migration, especially including verifying identity. Those seeking information about the credential migration left an average score of 3 of 5, or neutral. Half of the respondents felt they were able to do that task, presumably to better understand some aspect about the migration or creating a new account. Half of these folks did not feel like they got the information they were looking for.   
  * Selected quotations  
    * “"I had an account that was very easy to log into until you changed the whole program”  
    * "the new sign in does not work so I will be left out after 01-31-2025"  
    * "All the signing in, for myself has been very confusing. It took 3 tries. I deal with Parkinson's and hands shake”  
    * "I think doing this to a 99 year old veteran is awful" (from a caretaker)  
    * "I changed to a login.gov but got rejected from getting on my site"

    * specifically about page \- [Should I create a Login.gov or ID.me account to sign in to VA.gov?](https://www.va.gov/resources/should-i-create-a-logingov-or-idme-account-to-sign-in-to-vagov/)
      * “nothing on the page helped me decide"  
      * "what's the difference between them? Why do I have two choices?"

  * Help desk calls by definition will mostly be with folks who are having issues. So this data is largely a view of the most prevalent issues.  
  * Case category and type, added by the call center representative, didn’t always correlate to the tag added by the research. It’s possible that we are missing details that would line these up better, but in some instances it seems pretty clear by a subject line that the record doesn’t match the case category or type given.  
    * For example given the Category “Forgot Password”, the Type “ID.me”, one entry had the Subject “change phone number”  
      * Should this have been under the Category “unable to update personal information” instead of “forgot password”? Because it’s listed as forgot password, it seems this is an issue with sign in, so then needing help to change phone number would likely be an MFA concern. This particular entry was not tagged by the researcher with “forgot sign in info” but was tagged “CSP \- IDme”, “MFA”, and “issue \- personal info”  
  * The most used Category, as classified by the help center representatives, over Oct and Nov was "Identity verification” with over 6,000 calls  
    * In the Case Types under that, Login.gov Type was used for about 57% of those calls, almost twice as many as ID.me  
    * Interestingly, DS Logon and MyHealtheVet combined were used almost 800 times. It does appear that DS Logon has some type of identity verification process. But for MHV credentials, it could be the calling veteran mentioned currently using the legacy CSP and so was classified in that way, even though the call was about verifying with a modern credential.  
  * The second most used Category, as classified by the help center representatives, over these two months was “Navigation Issues” with 3,109. The Account Sign in Type under this Category had 2,653 or 85% of the cases in this Category.  
  * There is also a Category called Inability to Sign In with another 2,776. These cases are split pretty evenly between the Types called Confirmation Email Issue and EVSS Errors.  
    * We need to seek clarification on what the Type Confirmation Email Issue captures \- this could be MFA via email. Many cases filed here also seem to be issues getting the email confirmation when first setting up an account with a modern credential provider.  
    * EVSS errors include errors from places other than directly on VA.gov, like IAM team owned pages or issues, so it’s not a particularly good measurement for how many errors folks need help with that are in our team’s realm of control. But probably still worth tracking.  
  * The Category Forgot Password includes 2,148 records.  
    * About 30% each were from ID.me and Login.gov  
    * About 20% each were from DS Logon and MyhealteVet  
      * With total authentications during this two month period averaging about 11.5% (MHV) and 7.5% (DSL) of all sign ins, this means that legacy credential users are forgetting their passwords more often than modern credential users.  
      * This could be due to something unique with the service, for example DS Logon requires updating password very often. But this could also be an indication that less tech savvy veterans, or others who are more likely to forget their passwords, are waiting longer to switch to a modern credential.  
  * Finally the Unable to Update Personal information category included 399 records over these two months.  
    * 156, or 40% of these were the Type Contact Information.  
      * Several of these seemed like they could have been related to MFA. 7 were definite enough to get our researcher tag “MFA”  
      * 92, or 23% of those were related to Direct Deposit.  
        * This could be indicators of folks who want to change Direct Deposit without having a modern credential, but could also include those who feel more comfortable doing this task over the phone.  
  * Comparisons with February and March data  
    * There was a 21% increase in Category for Inability to Sign in Errors overall. But Case Type under that of EVSS errors decreased by 60% while Confirmation Email Issues rose 39% at the end of the year.  
      * This offers options for further consideration. First exploring if we or IAM or another team did something that might have reduced EVSS errors \- this data could prove that those were good changes. Second, assuming that the email confirmation issues are at least partly coming from modern credential sign up emails, this could simply be an indication of increased sign ups. It might warrant further research into how we and our modern credential partners could reduce issues with the sign up email in the future.  
    * There were more Navigation Issues this time. The 13% increase spread similarly between Case Types.  
    * Forgot Password Category issues reduced 5% but there was a shift in which credential folks called about. The deprecated credentials both decreased, MHV by 31% and DSL by 52%. The modern credentials increased, ID.me by 48% and Login.gov by 52%.  
    * Verification Category Issues increase by 20% overall. Login.gov requests increased while DSL requests saw a corresponding decrease. ID.me and MHV requests remained about the same.  
      * Again, since MHV doesn’t have an ID verification step, the assumption is this Type was designated because folks calling mentioned they needed to migrate away from the MHV sign in option.  
    * There were 19% fewer Unable to Update Information Category issues. The reduction was spread fairly evenly across the Types so we’re seeing roughly the same percentage per Type of issue.  
  * The researcher applied tags show a similar story to the call center classifications. Almost 30,000 researcher tags were added across the almost 14,500 calls logged.  
    * The most applied tag was “verify” on almost 5,700 total calls, or 19% of total researcher applied tags.  
      * With little context offered, we only tagged “verify \- ID” 102 times and “verify \- phone” 15 times. Still this helps illustrate that these are both specific verification issues that are the largest hurdles  
    * 15% of the tags were for Login.gov, while over 9% were for ID.me  
    * General issues with being unable to sign in gathered 11% of total tags.  
    * Passwords (almost 6%), general error (4%), and issues with personal info (almost 4%), sign in \- not mentioned (3.5%), forgot sign in information (3.4%), and DS Logon (2.6%) round out the top 10 researcher-applied tags, when excluding the generic tag “sign-in.”  
    * Some points of interest on lesser used tags  
      * 2 cited accessibility issues  
      * 64 were calls about the CSP transition  
      * 4 timeout issues were reported  
      * 6 calls were about guardian access  
      * 192 specified MFA. Without sorting through the full context of each case, it’s likely that many more calls had to do with MFA, especially from the Categories of Inability to Sign in or Unable to Update Information, but were not marked as such with the limited information that we saw.  
      * 7 issues concerning BDPR  
      * 12 calls were about the sign in page not loading  
      * 19 calls were about retiring the MHV credential  
      * 4 calls were about Terms of Use

## Comparisons

The sign in experience has had major changes over the last 6 months, namely with the deprecation of 2 credential (sign in) options and being very close to removing one of those. While over the long run we believe this will increase satisfaction with sign in, in the near term it’s no surprise that it decreased. While veterans want to have fewer options at sign in, they also don’t want to leave the option they use. So deprecating an option that just a year ago accounted for over 20% of sign ins each month, is naturally going to make a lot of folks upset. Change is hard. Add on that the process for signing up for a modern, more secure credential (ie Login.gov or ID.me) is difficult, especially with identity verification part of the process, and it’s a recipe for a lot of unhappy folks. This change is particularly hard. We must understand this context as we consider the late 2024 scores and data as compared to early 2024.  
From early 2024, counting all of February and March, to late 2024, counting all of October and November, the number of Feedback surveys for identity related products decreased quite substantially, by 75%. Intercept surveys also decreased by 26%. My VA411 help center calls increased by 4%. The total number decrease in surveys (857 fewer responses) was not quite offset by the increase in help center calls related to identity (620 more calls). This is interesting with the deprecation work of 2 credentials, I would have hypothesized there’d be a net increase in both responses and calls. Instead we saw a net decrease between all feedback sources looked at here.  
Looking at only the Feedback survey, negative feedback from early 2024 to late 2024 increased substantially (up 42%) while neutral responses decreased slightly (-2%) and positive responses decreased substantially (-40%).  
 Looking at only the intercept survey, “ability to do task” from early 2024 compared to late 2024 decreased (5%) while overall, site satisfaction was slightly more negative (-6%). With the larger sample size than on the feedback survey, these results are also more informative, with the same caveat of tendency toward extreme responses in these types of surveys.  
Considering MyVA411 Call Center data, several case Categories and Types increased while others decreased. “Inability to sign in” and “unable to update information” saw the largest decreases in calls (-18% and \-16% respectively) while “identity verification issues” and “navigation issues” saw the largest increases in calls (+20% and \+14% respectively). “Forgot password” Category was incrementally down (-4%).   
With the deprecation of two of the credentials and the two modern ones requiring a difficult identity verification process. It's not surprising that identity verification issues increased. Looking at the case type under this category. We saw calls for verification issues with Type Login.gov increased (up 1007 or 41%) by twice as much as calls about ID.me (up 355 or 23%. Calls about verification that were labeled for Type My Healthevet actually increased slightly (5%). This feels strange and may mean these calls were from folks who mentioned that they were currently using My Healthevet and trying to verify a new modern credential, or what we might call a misapplied Type. Calls about verification labeled with the Type  “DS Logon” decreased by half (from 627 to 284). This is more what we’d expect to see with a deprecated option.  
 Cases labeled under the “navigation issues” category increased by 14%. The case Types under this Category each increased \- account sign up 11% (258 cases), profile up 30% (25 cases), and identity up 45% (87 cases). If we add the increase in case Type under the “navigation issues” category (+258) with the decrease in the “inability to sign in” case Category (592), there's still a net decrease of cases of these related types. This then raises the question of if the sign in transition is having an effect on the decreasing calls about inability to sign in.  
Let’s take a closer look at the “inability to sign in” category. This is the Category with the largest decrease in call volume between these two time periods. This category has two case types, “confirmation email issues,” which increased by 39%, and” EVSS errors,” which decreased by 40%. It appears that the original intent of the confirmation email issue case Type may have been for email MFA, but it seems to be currently used also for setting up a new modern account, where either ID.me or Login.gov requires a confirmation email to be sent at the start of setting up the account. There currently seem to be several issues about not receiving the email or about an old email address or the wrong email being associated with the person trying to set up the account. So it's not too surprising that with more folks setting up a modern credential in late 2024 that this case type increased. It might be worthwhile to consider where code or error messages were changed in order to better understand where the EVSS error decrease came from.  
 The other Category with a substantial decrease in cases (-16%) is “unable to update information.” All Types here either decreased or saw no change in the number of cases. It’s worth noting that some of the case Types here are not directly related to Identity products, like military information and personal information. Others are at least somewhat related to identity products with contact information and direct deposit information. It's possible that the folks having issues updating their direct deposit information are not signing in with a correctly verified credential. In several of the “contact information” type cases, at least some of those appear related to MFA, namely needing to update their phone number. Not all of these are identity related, so it's a bit harder to point to any takeaways for this category.  
Finally, we saw the “forgot password” Category decrease by 4% (or 101 cases). We see something perhaps not surprising since folks continue to move off of DS Logon and My Healthevet and onto ID.me and Login.gov. The number of case Types for deprecated accounts decreased by around 25% and 50% respectively, while the modern accounts both increased by around 50% each. It's possible that fewer people being on DS Logon helped to decrease the total number of cases in this Category. DS Logon requires frequent password changes, and we see many issues based on that. We should continue watching this data throughout early 2025 to see if that continues to hold true. If it does, it should be counted as a success of the credential deprecation effort.

## Recommendations
This data is often too high level or vauge for us to take specific actions. However, the data does point to important considerations and places of further research or potential work. It also offers a view for how certain changes are affecting folks. With that in mind, the recommendations here are mostly for further research opportunities.

* Check back on these data sources to see  
  * If MyVA411 `verification issues` Category decreases after the mass migration away from MHV credentials, this could mean the current increase is reasonable based on how many folks are migrating right now. If it stays elevated, it would be a concern.  
  * If MyVA411 `confirmation email issues` Type under the inability to sign in category changes as the mass migration away from MHV ends, this could mean the current increase is reasonable based on how many folks are migrating right now. If it stays elevated, it would be a concern.  
  * If MyVA411 `forgot password` issues remain lower, or continue to decrease, this could be counted as a success of the credential deprecation effort.  
  * If MyVA411 `inability to sign in' Category issues remain lower, or continue to decrease, this could be counted as a success of the credential deprecation effort.
  * If on the survey data some researcher tags are used less as we move further past the MHV sign-in option removal, particularly `CSP transition` 'verify' and 'set up account'. If these don't decrease it may indicate an issue at one of these steps, but if these do decrease, then it's likely that the increase during this review was due to how many folks are making the change right now.
   * If on the survey data the negative sentiment decreases as folks get used to signing in with one of the modern credentials, then this data likely indicates the difficulty for folks to make a change from their normal process. If sentiment remains so negative, it could indicate an issue or extra hardships imposed by using a modern credential to sign in each time. 
* With fewer `EVSS` issues showing in MYVA411, understand what code changes or what error page changes happened between the February/March data and the October/November data that might have directly or indirectly caused phone calls for these to decrease. 
  * If nothing, then look into if this is a change in how the call center classifies certain calls, to better be able to utilize this data in the future.
  * However EVSS errors are generally not errors that this team can effect changes over, so likely not worthwhile spending too much time on.
* Design changes
   * Consider if there are ways to make the sign out button more clear or easier to find
   * Reconsider ways to push veterans towards MFA methods other than SMS. This might require working with CSPs where there are methods they don't currently offer
   * Press on CSPs to offer a bar code scan option on their driver's license for the ID verification step. We know that taking a clear image is a problematic step, and this set of data further supports that. How can we get the CSPs to make this step easier for folks?
   * Revisit the page [Should I create a Login.gov or ID.me account to sign in to VA.gov?](https://www.va.gov/resources/should-i-create-a-logingov-or-idme-account-to-sign-in-to-vagov/), since there were several mentions of this not being clear enough. Consider design and content changes that could better present the difference to folks.
