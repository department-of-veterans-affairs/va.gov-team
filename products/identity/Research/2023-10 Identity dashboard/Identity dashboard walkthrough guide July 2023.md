# Guide for quick developer walkthroughs (July 2023)

## Intro
Thanks for joining today!  We wanted to test out how you as a developer might onboard your application to a new platform that provides a service like user authentication and management.  

## Background
- Can you describe your role?
- What does your day to day look like?
- Have you had to integrate any applications with other platforms recently? If so, can you walk me through that process and what that looked like? Is there a site we can visit that you can show me how you would go about completing this task? (Have them share their screen and document their flow and usage of documentation.)
   - How did you navigate through the developer documentation?
- When you have a question about the work that you’re doing on a specific project e.g. Rails routes, how would you go about finding that answer? (Have them share their screen and document their flow and usage of documentation.)
[If there isn’t an example they can come up with for 3 or 4, can we use the auth0 site as a walk through]? 

## Walkthrough of Prototype:
### Scenario 1: As a developer onboarding your application to a new user authentication and management platform, I’d like to walk you through a few screens to better understand how you would complete certain tasks.

- Please go to: Figma Prototype
- After signing into the platform, where would you go next if you wanted to set up your application?
   - Can you walk me through this?
- If you wanted to add a team member, where would you go next?  
   - After they describe what they expect, have them navigate to the screen and get them to describe their expectations vs. what they see.  Consider verbiage, flow.
   - Ask them what actions they should be able to perform here as well. 
 

## Wrap Up:
- Are there any additional insights you’d like to share regarding this tool?
- How confident do you feel about navigating through these steps (this will probably come up during the interview naturally).
