## Background
This research will test an MVP of a "sign out of all devices" button, as well as projected future state that will include information about each device signed in and controls to sign out of each single device.

Sign in Service offers the flexibility to make each session longer. For example on the mobile app with SiS, we allow sessions to be 45 days, while our previous product, SSOe, offers 30 minute sessoins. With a user's sessions across multiple devices having the possibility of being concurrently maintained for 45 days, this increases security concerns. In addition, industry standards for an application with longer-term sessions is to offer a way to remotely sign out devices that are currently signed in the application. This allows a user to be proactive with their security by ending open sessions with one click for any reason, especially if they get an alert about or have a suspision of a bad actor in thier account.

## Research Goals:
- Explore Veterans' knowledge of personal device management as well as management of concurrent sessions on multiple devices.
- Explore Veterans' understanding of the use cases for device management and the security implications of multiple active sessions on various devices.
- Test the user flow for how a Veteran would access device management and signing out of multiple devices at once.
