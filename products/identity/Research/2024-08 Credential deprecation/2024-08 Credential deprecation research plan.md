# Research Plan for Identity Experience, sign-in page credential deprecation
## Background
We want to use the unified sign in page and the sign in modal to help encourage folks to make the transition from the MHV and DSL legacy credentials that are being sunset. Or design exploration especially includes de-emphasizing the legacy credentials, and adding content about how to transition to one of the modern credential options (LIG and IDme)

## OCTO Identity Crew Objectives
Objective 1: Create a smooth transition for Veterans from legacy to modern sign-in credentials
KR1: The number of users who have a MHV credential and neither ID.me or Login.gov is reduced to less than 500K by Oct 31, 2024 and to less than 100K by Jan 31, 2025
Baseline: 1.1M users in January 2024; 900K users in July 2024.
KR2: Sign-ins to VA web/mobile properties with the MHC credential are reduced to less than 1M per month by Oct 31, 2024 and to less than 200K per month by Jan 31, 2025
Baseline: 1.53M July '24 logins to VA.gov and the VA mobile app.
KR3: Retire the MHV in the targeted timeframe (last day available is January 31,
Objective 2 Improve the Veteran sign-in experience
Retiring the MHV credential is only one of the improvements we intend to make to the sign in experience in the coming months. Changes in these metrics will likely capture work related to and separate from the transition.
KR1: Improve CSAT score from roughly 1.7 in FY24 rating to date to at least 2.2 by the end of Q2 FY2025 (March 2025).
KR2: [In progress: determining a KR for how we've impacted contact center support calls]

## Veteran Journey
Securely accessing VA online services can happen at any stage in the Veteran journey. The updated Sign-in page and modal will apply to everyone who signs into VA online and uses the authenticated experience.
## Research Goals
Explore veterans thinking around ceratin terms and phrases relating to sign in and credential migration
Test the usability of a prototype for the sign in page and/or sign in modal
## Outcome
Learn what pain points the current design has with various audiences. Especially focus on the work we are doing to the UI to convey credential deprecation and encourage folks to move to a modern credential. But this also includes discovering other pain points that we can address in future releases.
## Research questions
Does the prototype allow users to successfully sign in with a legacy credential if they want to?
Do folks understand the content around credential deprecation, and if that applies to them?
Do folks understand the language updates we plan to use to describe the benefits of a modern credential? 
## Hypothesis


## Methodology
Remote usability testing will evaluate the prototype with participants. We’ll use Perigean’s Zoom account for these remote sessions
