## Starting the session | 5 minutes
[Have your camera on]
[If the participant doesn't show up in the first few minutes, reach out to Perigean on Slack.]


- Thank you for joining this session today! I first want to make sure that we're able to hear each other.
- [WAIT FOR RESPONSE - if can’t hear, [troubleshoot](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/troubleshooting-for-va-gov-research-sessions-in-pr#Troubleshootingresearchsessions-Problem:Usercannothearyou/youcan'thearthemonZoom) otherwise...]
- Great! I’m [YOUR NAME] and I’m a researcher for VA.gov. 
- I also have [NOTE TAKER NAME] here today to take some notes. I’ll ask them to introduce themself.
   - [PAUSE FOR NOTE TAKER to introduce themself]
- I'd also love for you to tell us a little about yourself.
   - [PAUSE FOR PARTICIPANT to introduce themself]
- Nice to meet you!
- We do have a couple other team members in the waiting room who would like to observe and help take notes. But before we invite them, I'd like to tell you more about what we're doing today.
- The subject of our research today is the sign in process on VA.gov. We are not testing your ability.
- Today we're going to talk about how you sign in to access and manage your VA benefits and health care.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. The goal is to improve this process to better meet veterans needs. We will not be offended by any opinions you express, and we welcome your candid feedback.
- A bit later on, I’ll ask you to interact with a prototype. Just to prepare you for that, it will look real, but it won't be, and we won’t be accessing your account or real information. We use prototypes to help us test things before we decide what to make real.
- This entire session will take no more than 45 minutes.
- I do want you to be as comfortable as possible, so if for any reason and at any time you want to pause or even stop the session, please let me know.
- Any questions so far?
---
- Ok, let’s get to the folks we have waiting to join the session. Perigean did previously ask for your consent to allow other people to observe today, but I know things can change. So I'd like to confirm with you now - are you okay with a couple of additional observers joining us during this session?
   - [If NO]: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - [If YES]: Admit observers.
- Let’s have each of our observers quickly go around and introduce themselves with cameras on, please. 
   - [PAUSE for observers to introduce themselves]
- Ok and now I’ll ask our notetakers and observers to mute themselves and turn off their cameras for the remainder of the sessions to save on distractions and to save Zoom bandwidth.
- We sometimes use written quotes from our notes to help others at the VA understand why we want to make certain changes, but your name and information will not be directly linked to any of your comments.
Are you comfortable with that?
- I'd also like to ask your permission to record our discussion today. This helps us if we need to look back for clarifications like to make sure we noted your opinions correctly. We delete recordings after we finish analysis, which usually takes a couple weeks. Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and our audio as we talk today?
   - [IF YES - RECORD TO CLOUD] 
   - Now that we're recording, I have to confirm once more - are you are ok if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- [WAIT FOR RESPONSE]
- Ok, that's it for set up! Do you have any questions on any of this setup stuff before we start?


## Starter Questions | 5 minutes
- I’d like to start with a few questions to get to know how you access VA services online
- Could you first let me know what device you are using right now for this call.
   -[Phone, laptop, doesn’t have to be brand]
   - Is that how you usually access the VA online?
   - Any particular reason you use [DEVICE] the most
- When you are on your [phone/computer/tablet] how do you typically bring up VA online? [the mobile app, VA.gov, MHV website, something else]
- And is there a particular VA service or benefit that you use often?
   - If it varies, what was the reason you visited most recently? [remember this for later on]
- When was the last time you accessed VA online?  What were you trying to do?
- It looks like you answered that you use the My HealtheVet sign in option, do we have that right?
   - Have you ever sign into VA.gov using another option? 


## Task - Prototype | 15-20 minutes
- Ok so now I’d like to take a look at the prototype design. Just a quick reminder that this is a website design that we are thinking about using. It may look like the real VA.gov but it won’t be, so everything might not work like you are used to. Your thoughts and ideas about this will help us know how we can make it better.
- I’m going to send you a link in the Zoom chat.

      - What would you expect to do to complete the account?

## Round 3 - Closing Q’s and Thank you | 3 minutes
- That is all the questions that I wanted to cover today, so I’m going to look at my messages to see if notetakers and observers had any questions they wanted to ask or follow up on.
- Do you have any questions or further comments about what we discussed today?
- We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on VA.gov to make sure it works for Veterans.
- Before we end this call, a few final logistic items - Perigean is who set up the scheduling with you - they will get you set up with the thank you stipend. They will also send you information that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to give them the chance to participate in future research.
- Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!


## Emergency Exit
[Emergency exit strategy]
- I really appreciate you taking some time with us today. I have now covered all the questions we have for you. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.
OR
- I am so sorry, but the prototype we wanted to test with you today is having a glitch and we aren’t going to be able to use that. Unfortunately, we’ll need to end the session. I apologize for that, but I appreciate your willingness to help us on this.
