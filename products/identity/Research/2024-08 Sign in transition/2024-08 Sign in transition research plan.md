# Research Plan for Identity Experience, sign-in page credential deprecation
## Background
We want to use the unified sign in page and the sign in modal to help encourage folks to make the transition from the MHV and DSL legacy credentials that are being sunset. Or design exploration especially includes de-emphasizing the legacy credentials, and adding content about how to transition to one of the modern credential options (LIG and IDme)

## OCTO Identity Crew Objectives
- Objective 1: Create a smooth transition for Veterans from legacy to modern sign-in credentials
  - KR1: The number of users who have a MHV credential and neither ID.me or Login.gov is reduced to less than 500K by Oct 31, 2024 and to less than 100K by Jan 31, 2025
      - Baseline: 1.1M users in January 2024; 900K users in July 2024.
   - KR2: Sign-ins to VA web/mobile properties with the MHC credential are reduced to less than 1M per month by Oct 31, 2024 and to less than 200K per month by Jan 31, 2025
      - Baseline: 1.53M July '24 logins to VA.gov and the VA mobile app.
KR3: Retire the MHV in the targeted timeframe (last day available is January 31,
- Objective 2 Improve the Veteran sign-in experience. 
   - Retiring the MHV credential is only one of the improvements we intend to make to the sign in experience in the coming months. Changes in these metrics will likely capture work related to and separate from the transition.
   - KR1: Improve CSAT score from roughly 1.7 in FY24 rating to date to at least 2.2 by the end of Q2 FY2025 (March 2025).
   - KR2: [In progress: determining a KR for how we've impacted contact center support calls]

## Veteran Journey
Securely accessing VA online services can happen at any stage in the Veteran journey. The updated Sign-in page and modal will apply to everyone who signs into VA online and uses the authenticated experience.

## Research Goals
- Explore veterans thinking around certain terms and phrases relating to sign in and credential migration
- Test the usability of a prototype for the sign in page and/or sign in modal
- Test the entire flow of the sign in communications strategy for users of deprecated credentials 
	 - this includes the sign in page and/or modal as well as interstitial content for more aggressive deprecation messaging

## Outcome
Uncover areas for improvement with our design and the content by allowing veterans to interact with our prototype. This will allow us to update the UI and content in a way that better encourages veterans to stop using a deprecated credential and to instead use a modern credential. We expect to find both immediate next steps and to uncover insights for future work.

## Research questions
- Does the prototype allow users to successfully sign in with a legacy credential if they want to?
- Do folks understand the content around credential deprecation, and if that applies to them?
- Do folks understand the language updates we plan to use to describe the benefits of a modern credential? 

## Hypothesis
- H1: MHV credential users will understand that their credntial of preference will be going away soon
- H2: MHV credential users will be more likely to use their existing modern credential (login.gov of ID.me) to sign into VA.gov
- H3: MHV credential users will not be any more likely to create a new modern credential in the moment if they are focused on a specific task as their reason to visit VA.gov

## Methodology
Remote usability testing will evaluate the prototype with participants. We’ll use Perigean’s Zoom account for these remote sessions

## Recruitment
### Recruitment approach
- We will use Perigean to recruit Veterans for this moderated study.
- Under represented groups this research will target as participants
  - Assistive Tech users (screen zoom, and screen reader in particular)
  - mobile users
  - cognitive disabilities
recruitment checker in google sheets - link to be added

### Recruitment criteria
- 15 Veterans for at least 12 completed sessions
- Baseline criteria (must-haves)
  - Must have a computer or mobile phone and be willing to complete their sessions on this device
  - Must be willing to share a web browser window on the Zoom call
  - Must have a working microphone
  - Must have Zoom downloaded to their computer or phone prior to the session and know how to share their screen
- In addition our primary product criteria includes:
  - Must be Veterans
  - Preference to participants who’ve signed in using MHV sign in credential in the last 6 months, for any reason. (at least 8)
- Our primary diversity and inclusion criteria:
x of mobile users
x of cognitive disabilities
x screen reader users
x of keyboard navigators
### Screener questions
- Which sign in option do you use the most [LIG, IDme, MHV, DSL]
- Do you ever use a sign in option other than the one you use the most?

## Timeline
- Recruiting: Early Sept
- Pilot: Mid Sept
- Sessions: Mid Sept
