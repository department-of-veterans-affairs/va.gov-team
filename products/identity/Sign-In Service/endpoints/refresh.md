# Refresh

## Description

Used to refresh all tokens related to the client's session. This endpoint is called after the Access token has expired, and requires a valid (non-expired) Refresh token. Mobile/API will receive a JSON response with the new tokens, web/cookie will have cookies set to the new token values.

After the refresh is performed the original valid Refresh token will be invalidated - a subsequent `/refresh` call will require the use of the new Refresh token.

## Token endpoint

### Access Token Attributes

A Sign in Service [`Client Config`](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Sign-In%20Service/configuration/client_config.md) can be set to specify the inclusion of the following user attributes, derived from the credential provider, on the returned `access_token`.

* `first_name`
* `last_name`
* `email`
