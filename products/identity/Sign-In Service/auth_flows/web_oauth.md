## Description & Prerequisites

This document describes how our web-based OAuth partners can integrate with the Sign in Service. Before starting local development the following prerequisites should be completed:

1. In order to successfully develop against a local instance of Sign in Service [vets-api](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api) must be set up, either natively or through Docker.
2. `vets-api` localhost performs a real authentication with the CSP, but relies on mocked user data from MPI. It must be configured to look for this mocked data from [vets-api-mockdata](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api-mockdata). Make sure you have the latest version of `vets-api-mockdata` (including running `ruby make_table.rb` in the mock data repository to populate the mock data tables) before attempting to authenticate with SiS to prevent missing mocked data errors.

### Client Config

In order to make use of the Sign in Service clients must first [register a `Client Configuration`](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Sign-In%20Service/configuration/client_config.md).

When registering a Client Config for a web or cookie integration with SiS, set the following attributes:

- `authentication`: 'cookie'
- `anti_csrf`: `true`
- `access_token_duration`: 5.minutes
- `refresh_token_duration`: 30.minutes
- `pkce`: true
- `certificates`: nil

## Postman Collection

The VSP Identity team maintains a [Postman collection](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/master/teams/vsp/teams/Identity/Sign%20In%20Service/sis_postman_v1.json) to enable developers to more easily test against SiS routes. Documentation on how to use the SiS Postman collection can be found [here](Sign-in-service_Postman.md). This collection is set up for both web/cookie & API-based authentication.

## Oauth Workflow

1. User lands on [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) wanting to sign in via OAuth
2. User clicks on the button to sign in with their credential service provider (CSP)
3. Vets-website calls the vets-api OAuth `/authorize` endpoint with specific query parameters outlined in the Parameters Table below
4. Vets-api redirects to CSP website for user to enter credentials
5. CSP calls Sign-in-Service (SiS) API endpoint `/callback` to create an auth code
6. SiS API redirects user to `[environment]/auth/login/callback` with a `code` query parameter and `state` that is verified client side
7. Vets-website makes a POST call to the SiS API `/token` endpoint to get Access Token + Refresh Tokens + Anti-CSRF Token + Info Token Cookies

  | Cookie Name | Description |
  | --- | --- |
  | vagov_access_token | Access token used to access authenticated pages on va.gov, contains no user information |
  | vagov_refresh_token | May contain user information, used to obtain new tokens |
  | vagov_anti_csrf_token | Optional, currently disabled feature to preven cross-site request forgery |
  | vagov_info_token | Token used by the frontend to determine timeout counters |

8. Vets-api stores Access Token + Refresh Token + Anti-CSRF Token in cookies
9. Vets-website uses Access Token cookie to hit the `/introspect` endpoint and other authentication-protected routes:
    - request: `vagov_access_token=<accessTokenHash>`
    - response: `"data": { user_data }`
10. Vets-website uses the Refresh token to get an new Access Token + Refresh Token (when Access token reaches expiry) by hitting the `/refresh` endpoint. New token cookies are stored in the browser with a successful response.

## Service Descriptions

### Access Token JWT

- Access token is a JWT encoded and signed with a private key stored on vets-api
  - Eventually the public key associated with this will be published in a well known configuration
- Access token stores the following fields:
  - anti_csrf_token
  - created_time
  - expiration_time
  - last_regeneration_time
  - parent_refresh_token_hash
  - refresh_token_hash
  - session_handle
  - user_uuid
  - version
  - aud
  - Client_id
  - Jti
  - Sub
  - Iat

### Anti CSRF Token

- Typically this must be used for /refresh calls, and must match the anti_csrf_token given in the latest /token endpoint call, or latest /refresh call
- Currently this is disabled, and can be safely ignored

### Code Verifier / Code Challenge

- Code verifier is a random string value
  - `code_verifier = '5787d673fb784c90f0e309883241803d'`
- Code challenge is a hashed urlsafe_encoded value from code_verifier:

  ```ruby
  code_verifier = '5787d673fb784c90f0e309883241803d'
  url_unsafe_code_challenge = Digest::SHA256.digest(code_verifier)
  code_challenge = Base64.urlsafe_encode64(url_unsafe_code_challenge)
  => "1BUpxy37SoIPmKw96wbd6MDcvayOYm3ptT-zbe6L_zM="
  ```

### Logout Endpoint

- This endpoint expects a valid access token from the user to be present when calling the `logout` endpoint. This function will allow a user to logout of the session associated with the access token. More information about how the endpoint works can be found [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Sign-In%20Service/endpoints/revoke_all.md).

### Refresh Token

- Refresh token is encrypted and stored as an opaque string object for client
  - Values stored in refresh token are only relevant for internal sign in service behavior

### Revoke All Sessions Endpoint

- This endpoint expects a valid access token from the user to be present when calling the `revoke_all_sessions` endpoint. This function will allow a user to logout of all sessions currently associated with the logged in user according to the valid access token being passed into the request. More information about how the endpoint works can be found [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Sign-In%20Service/endpoints/revoke_all.md).
- This endpoint currently is not callable by vets-website but will be released in a future version.

### Token Expiration

- `Access_token` = 5 minutes
- `Refresh_token` = 30 minutes

### User Introspect / Information Endpoints

- The introspection endpoint is used to request user data. The introspection endpoint expects the use of the access token to get the user information. The data that is returned is a json formatted string.

```
{
  "data": {
    "id": "",
    "type": "users",
    "attributes": {
      "uuid": "876f0f36-6b12-4273-babe-12144eaa2d57",
      "first_name": "FAKEY",
      "middle_name": null,
      "last_name": "MCFAKERSON",
      "birth_date": "1938-10-06",
      "email": "faker.fake@fake.com",
      "gender": "M",
      "ssn": "123456789",
      "birls_id": null,
      "authn_context": "logingov",
      "icn": "1012852978V019884",
      "edipi": "1320002080",
      "active_mhv_ids": ["12210827", "123456"],
      "sec_id": null,
      "vet360_id": null,
      "participant_id": "600152407",
      "cerner_id": null,
      "cerner_facility_ids": [],
      "vha_facility_ids": ["200MH", "989", "360", "200MHS", "648"],
      "id_theft_flag": false,
      "verified": true,
      "access_token_ttl": 300
    }
  }
}
```

- Web-authenticated users can also access the traditional `vets-api/v0/users` endpoint for more extensive user information. This route is covered by SiS authentication and requires the same valid access token as the `introspect` endpoint.
