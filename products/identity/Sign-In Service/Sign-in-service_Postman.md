# Sign in Service Postman Collection
SiS features a [Postman Collection](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/master/teams/vsp/teams/Identity/Sign%20In%20Service/sis_postman_v1.json) that provides routes for both cookie-based & API-based authentication.

# Authenticating with SiS & Postman

## SiS Postman Collection Variables
The variable values needed to connect to a vets-api instance are managed within the `Variables` subtab in the `Sign in Service` collection management:

## Localhost authentication
The SiS Postman collection cannot perfectly imitate a web browser - in particular the initial authorization with a CSP must be performed in a web browser due to the necessity of completing various web forms. In order to use the Postman collection begin with the following steps:
1. Make sure that your local instance of `vets-api` (localhost:3000) is running and `vets-website` (localhost:3001) is NOT, as the latter will automatically call the `/token` endpoint at the end of the callback process, consuming the auth_code that is needed for use in Postman.
2. Navigate in your web browser to the `/authorize` endpoint generated by Postman. It is critical that the `code_challenge` is either the same as Postman's saved variable or generated from a `code_verifier` that you have access to in order for the later token request to work. In order to easily copy the generated Postman URL you can use the 'Documentation' view in the right sidebar:

    `http://localhost:3000/v0/sign_in/authorize?type=logingov&acr=min&client_id=web&code_challenge=JNkFflCkxk1K6gQUf23P_5Ctl_T65_xkkOU_y-Cc2XI=&code_challenge_method=S256&state=c4addf6001661631d2524043ca31107e`
3. Complete the CSP authentication and find the `callback` call that `vets-api` makes to `vets-website` at the end of the authentication process. This can either be done in your web browser or in Postman via the [Postman Interceptor](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-interceptor/aicmkgpgakddgnaphhhpliifpcfhicfo?hl=en) plugin:

    `http://localhost:3001/auth/login/callback?code=11a51d7d-3bea-4552-b06c-3bb5655f617c&state=c4addf6001661631d2524043ca31107e&type=logingov`
4. Copy the `code` URL parameter into your Postman SiS collection variables as the new `auth_code` and save the variables file. If you were using a newly generated `code_challenge` for the `/authorize` call you'll need to update the `code_verifier` variable as well.
5. You should now be able to use Postman to make a `/token` call, passing the `auth_code` and receiving a set of tokens that Postman will save to make further calls. Postman will also automatically update tokens for `/refresh` calls and wipe them for `/logout`, `/revoke`, and `/revoke_all` calls.

## Dev & Staging authentication
Interacting with dev & staging SiS through Postman is largely the same as the process on localhost; you will still need to authenticate through an `/authorize` request with a `code_challenge` that you have the corresponding `code_verifier` to, then copy the `code` passed to the frontend `/callback` route into Postman to receive your tokens. In addition, the following changes will need to be made to the preceding workflow:

1. The SiS Postman `vets_api_env` variable must be set to `https://{dev|staging}-api.va.gov` - note the necessary `https` scheme.
2. In order to prevent the vets-website frontend from calling the `/token` endpoint immediately and rendering the copied `code` useless you must prevent the request from sending in your browser's devtools: block `{dev|staging}-api.va.gov/v0/sign_in_token`
