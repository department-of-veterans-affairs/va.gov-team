# Product Refinement

On Friday, April 15, 2024 the Identity Team had our first product refinement for the Login SLA project.


It was focused around this Problem Statement:

__Problem Statement__
_We do not currently have any current Service Level Agreements for VA.gov logins, and publishing them -- as well as dashboards that visualize key data -- will help us monitor and improve the Veteran login experience._

With the Problem Statement in mind, we brainstormed around two high-level User Stories
__High-Level User Stories__
* As a VA Team Member, I would like to see high-level data visualizations related to the status and performance of authentication services on VA.gov, so that I am provided with immediate, comprehensive information about the status of services that I am using.
* As a VA Team member, I would like to see service level agreements related to the status and performance of authentication services on VA.gov, so I can understand what to expect from those services.

One thing to note: this is specifically around Service-Level Agreements for

The brainstorming focused upon three separate areas:
* __Outstanding Questions__ - What are we unsure of, what do we still need to discuss?
* __Tasking__ - How do we break down what needs to be done and assign it?
* __After Party__ - Save for future iterations.



### Outstanding Questions
Note: anything that wasn't specfically within scope of the User Stories or would be determined during the process got moved to either Tasking or After Party.
* Can we reference example SLAs as inspiration?
* Do customers need to agree to the SLAs?
* Should we have a communication standard with our SLA to other services?
* How many SLAs to we want to commit to?
* What SLAs to we want to commmit to?
* Assign external service to monitor SLO?
