# Login SLA

## Overview: 
Publishing the Service Level Agreement (SLA) targets we want to hit for Veterans logging into VA.gov. with the ultimate goal of continuously improving the login process to VA.gov. This maps to _O1KR2: VA.gov authentication SLOs are developed._

Target: Other va.gov product teams.

This is a follow-up to the Login SLO project.

## Problem Statement: 
We do not currently have any current Service Level Agreements for VA.gov logins, and publishing them -- as well as dashboards that visualize key data -- will help us monitor and improve the Veteran login experience.

## What's In Scope: 
* Service Level Objectives
  * Determining what data to display on the SLO dashboards for VA.gov teams.
* Service Level Agreements
  * Creating the SLA for VA.gov teams
  * Determining how to publish the agreements to VA.gov teams



## Out of Scope: (for this iteration)
* Dashboards for Veterans
* Incident Response
  * Accountability in SLOs - who gets assigned & their impact toward total numbers
    * Automation
      * Notify when investigations are happening.
      * Slack notifications when SLOs reach a certain level.


## Use Cases:

- As a VA Team Member, I would like to see high-level data visualizations related to the status and performance of authentication services on VA.gov, so that I am provided with immediate, comprehensive information about the status of services that I am using. 
- As a VA Team member, I would like to see service level agreements related to the status and performance of authentication services on VA.gov, so I can understand what to expect from those services.



## Assumptions:
- We publish around the dashboard created in the Login SLO project.
  
## Technical Considerations:
| Issue         | Notes         | 
| ------------- |:-------------| 
| VA Policy |  Is there VA policy surrounding availability & response times?     |
| Industry Standards |  Are there industry standards surrounding availability & response times?     |

## UX/ Design Considerations:
| Issue         | Notes         | 
| ------------- |:------------- | 
| Language when publishing the SLA |   Would like UX help in crafting the publishing language          |
| Veterans who don't speak tech | How do we ensure they understand what they might be seeing? |


## Measuring Success:
| KPI           | Notes         | 
| ------------- |:-------------| 
| How are we meeting the SLA  |    |


## Milestones:
* SLA are agreed-upon.
  



## Future Scope:
* Determining our response to observed service degradation.
* As the Identity Team adds new products and takes on new responsibilities, it is anticipated that new SLA will need to be established and published.
