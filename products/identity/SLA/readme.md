# Login SLA

## Overview: 
Publishing the Service Level Agreement (SLA) targets we want to hit for Veterans logging into VA.gov. with the ultimate goal of continuously improving the login process to VA.gov. This maps to _O1KR2: VA.gov authentication SLOs are developed._

While our audience for these are other VA.gov product teams, the SLA themselves should explain why each one is important to Veterans logging into VA.gov.

This is a follow-up to the [Login SLO](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Products/Product%20Briefs/Login%20SLO.md) project.

## Problem Statement: 

We do not currently have any current Service Level Agreements for VA.gov logins, and publishing those agreements -- alongside dashboards that visualize the corresponding data -- for other VA.gov teams will help us monitor and improve the Veteran login experience on an ongoing basis. It will also allow other teams understand what to expect from us, as well as show our professionalism reliability in providing those services.

## What's In Scope: 
* Service Level Data Visualizations
  * Determining what data to display on the SLO dashboards for VA.gov teams.
    * Logging in
    * Data Display
    * Staying Logged in
    * Logging Out
* Service Level Agreements
  * Creating the SLA for VA.gov teams
  * Determining how to publish the agreements to VA.gov teams



## Out of Scope: (for this iteration)
* Dashboards for Veterans
* Incident Response
  * Accountability in SLOs - who gets assigned & their impact toward total numbers
    * Automation
      * Notify when investigations are happening.
      * Slack notifications when SLOs reach a certain level.


## Use Cases:

- As a VA Team Member, I would like to see high-level data visualizations related to the status and performance of authentication services on VA.gov, so that I am provided with immediate, comprehensive information about the status of services that I am using. 
- As a VA Team Nember, I would like to see service level agreements related to the status and performance of authentication services on VA.gov, so I can understand what to expect from those services.



## Assumptions:
- We publish around the dashboard created in the Login SLO project.
  
## Technical Considerations:
| Issue         | Notes         | 
| ------------- |:-------------| 
| VA Policy |  Is there VA policy surrounding availability & response times?     |
| Industry Standards |  Are there industry standards surrounding availability & response times?     |

## UX/ Design Considerations:
| Issue         | Notes         | 
| ------------- |:------------- | 
| Language when publishing the SLA |   Would like UX help in crafting the publishing language          |



## Measuring Success:
| KPI           | Notes         | 
| ------------- |:-------------| 
| How are we meeting the SLA  |    |


## Milestones:
* SLA are agreed-upon.
* SLA are published
* Other teams are notified
  



## Future Scope:
* Determining our response to observed service degradation.
* As the Identity Team adds new products and takes on new responsibilities, it is anticipated that new SLA will need to be established and published.
