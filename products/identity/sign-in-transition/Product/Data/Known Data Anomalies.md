| 1 | 12/13/24    | Data Quality | On 12/11, the MHV team reported anomalies in the IAM dataset. We investigated this as part of [SIT-423](https://jira.devops.va.gov/browse/SIT-423). For the 2 ICNs that MHV provided, the issue is due to users getting new ICNs. MHV dataset includes some ICNs which have subsequently been "replaced". In these two cases, the MHV dataset includes both old and new. The impact is that this increases the denominator and also inflates the number of users with no modern credentials. There were 1,683 Veteran records readily identifiable as fitting this category. However, the same issue likely applies to some of the ~450K ICNs that MHV is reporting having MHV credentials but not in AuthDB. This is likely something for the MHV team to resolve to clean up the legacy ICNs. | We are counting invalid ICNs included in the MHV dataset, which is inflating the set of users with no modern credentials. We suspect this is on MHV's side to fix.                                                                         | Open           |
| 2 | 12/13/24    | Data Quality | There are ~90K records that don't have any credentials but the ICNs are in AuthDB. From a spot check, many are MHV records, but MHV isn't reporting that the user has a credential, so MHV takes preference. In other cases, users have some legacy credentials in AuthDB that are filtered out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Does not affect the Domo dashboard, but they are in the dataset being uploaded to CDW. These users are not matched to any credentials and are filtered out on our side because MHV is our authoritative source on MHV users.                | Open  |
| 3 | 2/4/25      | Data Quality | The views "MHV CSP users by Owned Credentials - [Monthly / Weekly]" are expected to align with the totals for the same periods in the views "Total Unique User Authentications by CSP and [Month / Week]" when filtered on "MHV Option 2".  The Owned Credential numbers are slightly lower, by about 200.  This is due to ICNs received in authentication data from SiS and MHV Option 2 are not in AuthDB. Joining with AuthDB is required to know what other credentials are owned by the user.  In sample data, it was only 2 instance for SiS and the rest of discrepancy in MHV authentication data.  One contributor may be due to known anomalies related tracking transactions with legacy ICNs. In this case, there is a small number which are actively being addressed by MHV.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | The discrepancy does not have statistically significant impact.                | Open  |
| 4 | 2/6/25      | Data Quality | There is a known issue where some users have multiple SECIDs and in these cases, the correlation to ICN fails.  There are relatively few instances of this issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |  There are relatively few instances of this issue, impacting about ~100 users/month.               | Open  |
| 5 | 2/21/25      | Data Quality |IAM is implementing a fix for an ID.me wrapper issue that will unlink existing correlations. Currently, at least 2,860 users are impacted, according to MHV. While the total number of users with MHV credentials remains unchanged, the issue primarily affects the reporting of users with modern credentials. Some users may be incorrectly reported as having a modern credential when they do not, while others may be reported as not having one when they do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |  No impact on the total number of users with MHV credentials. However, once IAM implements the fix, users who 1) previously authenticated via the ID.me wrapper, 2) later used ID.me directly, and 3) don't have any other credentials, will shift into the “users without a modern credential” category, increasing this segment by approximately 54,000. This reporting discrepancy will self-correct as affected users re-authenticate.               | Open  |
| 5 | 5/13/25      | Data Quality | Tier 1 data for the "Identity Verification Issues" category contains only a single entry prior to January 1, 2024 (recorded in October 2023). This mirrors a similar pattern observed with 2FA issues in a separate report on Domo, suggesting a broader gap in Tier 1 historical data. | Limited historical data for Tier 1 - effectively no data prior to Jan 2024 - resulting in inconsistent reporting when compared to Tier 2 and Tier 3, which both have data available back to June 2023. | Open  |
