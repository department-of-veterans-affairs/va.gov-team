|----|----------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------|
| 1  | 2024-10-11     |The query the MHV team was using the generate the dataset for active MHV users was modified to remove the filter for users who had not logged in within 730 days. | The addition of a date based filter for login date was intended to remove users considered inactive for our reporting. It was determined that this was unneccssary due to the inclusion of the filter for deactivated users who meet this definition and the shared definition of active users may be a source of misalignment between MHV and the Domo SSiT dashboard numbers. | MHV    |
| 2  | 2024-11-12     |MHV removed the filter for username/password, resulting in the inclusion of users without these credentials in the 11/12 data drop. | This filter change on MHV’s end has expanded our initial weekly and monthly reports to now encompass users without a username/password. We’re awaiting an updated dataset from MHV that will allow us to distinguish users by account status (Premium/Basic Matched) and filter data as needed to gain clearer insights. | MHV    |
| 3  | 2024-11-18     | Added two cards to Domo based on the comprehensive weekly data set, one for for users with Basic Match and one for users with MHV Premium. Users with no UID and password are filtered out. | Demonstrate split between users with MHV Basic Match and Premium credentials. Data also now includes users with no UID or password but they are being filtered out on both charts until we have more data from CDW to match against these users.      | John Marchi    |
| 4  | 2024-11-27     | Removed "not correlated" grouping for MHV Credential views and moved these users into "And neither Login.gov nor ID.me". | "Not correlated" was a misnomer and should have been something like "No user credentials in AuthDB".  This is an expected use case whereby users have only MHV credentials and no other credentials tracked by IAM. Also, AuthDB was recently updated to updated records which were missing ICNs for improved data quality.      | Steve Dickson    |
| 5 | 2024-12-03     | Updated the title and label of the "Users with MHV Credentials" section. Title updated to "Active MHV Users", updated card titles to reflect users with or without MHV credentials. | Users without MHV credentials have been added to the data set to further align with MHVs reported numbers.       | John Marchi    |
| 6 | 2024-12-05     | Removed the MHV graph for premium users with the expanded data set.  | This graph became redundant after the decision to add users without MHV credentials to the primary weekly and monthly views.       | John Marchi    |
| 7 | 2024-12-10     | Updated transform that drives the MHV Basic Match card to detect when users go from having MHV credenetials to not. | MHV is allowing users to deprecate their credentials as part of the effort to move users over to modern credentials. This change allows us to correctly show the trend for deprecated MHV credentials over time.        | John Marchi    |
| 8 | 2024-12-11     | Added a weekly report to the "IAM SSOe - CSP Usage" graph in Domo, in addition to the existing monthly report. | To enable tracking of weekly distinct user counts by CSP authentications, especially the usage of MHV credentials, as we approach the 1/31 deadline.       | Steve Dickson   |
| 9 | 2024-12-24     | Replaced cards generated from datasets credentialTotalSummaryIndexes v3 and v4 with cards generated from new weekly and monthly datasets from a combined transform. | Datasets used to create cards for weekly and monthly reporting with MHV data had previously been done in three transforms, weekly, monthly, and an additional transform using expanded data containing basic match and MHV credential information. These were combined to a single transform to simplify the process and reduce redundant actions for maintainability.       | John Marchi    |
| 10 | 2025-01-01     | Added the new comprehensive unique Authn totals (SiS and SSOe). At bottom of dashboard temporarily. In near future, plan is to replace the legacy SSOe-only totals.   | Per VA request.  | Steve Dickson    |
| 11 | 2025-01-08     | Updated MHV color on Domo charts from green to red. Also updated to sort all the CSP series for consistency.   |  Per Dr. Josephs request to be consistent with red (users needing migrated) in other views.  | Steve Dickson    |
| 12 | 2025-01-08     | Removed the header and view for SiS authentication.  In appendix now but can be deleted.  |  The metrics in DataDog are no longer available.  Same information is available in DataDog dashboards. | Steve Dickson    |
| 13 | 2025-01-10     | Removed the following unused views from Domo: Login.gov, VA.gov Unified Sign-in Page (USiP) Authentications (USiP/SSOe only), Credential Last Used per IAM MPI, MHV Primary ID on File | After confirmation with POs, these views were identified as no longer in use. Additionally, some of the data provided by these charts is available in DataDog, making them redundant and unnecessary in Domo. As a result, these were removed to enhance the relevance and clarity of the data displayed in Domo. | Steve Dickson   |
| 14 | 2025-01-10     | Updated the comprehensive unique authentications cards to include MHV Option 2 | Per VA PO's request to be able to see unique authentication totals across VA. | Steve Dickson   |
| 15 | 2025-01-15     | Re-introduced last active filter with options for 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, or all time options for the Credential Segments part of the dashboard. Updated the filter bar to a new default filter of all available data. To drive the filter, the "MHV Expanded Weekly And Monthly Credential Summary Totals" ETL was updated to create splits for each time period based on the last used or MHV recent activity dates. | Request by the POs for visibility into how many accounts shown on the dashboard are active over various time periods.       | John Marchi   |
| 16 | 2025-01-23     | Introduced cards for MHV CSP Users and whether they have modern credentials. | Request from POs to see the "true" count of users who need to transition, i.e. users who are still using MHV credentials and do not have a Login.gov or ID.me account.       | John Marchi   |
| 17 | 2025-30-1     | Removed Communication Campaign dashboard from Domo. |  Confirmed with POs that this is an unused dashboard. Removing it reduces dataset noise and allows cleanup of related data flows.       | Steve Dickson    |
| 18 | 2025-02-25     | Re-uploaded MHV weekly history from mid November on. | There was an error in the process for tracking users who became premium or credentials that did not correctly identify when the change happened. This was fixed and the history re-run to correct the previous run.       | John Marchi  |
| 19 | 2025-03-6     | Migrated all existing Splunk/SSOe queries to the VA enterprise EDL Splunk instance ahead of the March 2025 cutover. Initial validation using mock and real IAM data confirmed API access and query functionality, with further validation planned for a full week and full month of data. | Required to ensure all Splunk/SSOe queries function correctly in the enterprise instance before the final cutover.       | Steve Dickson  |
| 20 | 2025-03-27     | Updated ACTIVE_SINCE_YEAR_GROUP logic to use the current date instead of a fixed Jan-01 reference. Also added ACTIVE_YEAR_SINCE_GROUP_NAME to drive the "Credential Segment" dashboard section filter with human readable names (e.g. "users active in the last 6 months"). | Ensures filters accurately reflect user activity within rolling time periods and remain current month over month.       | John Marchi, Dennis O'Neill    |
| 21 | 2025-04-15     | Introduced cards for DSL CSP Users and whether they have modern credentials. | Request from POs to see the "true" count of users who need to transition, i.e. users who are still using DSL credentials and do not have a Login.gov or ID.me account.       | John Marchi, Dennis O'Neill   |
| 22 |2025-04-18     | Modified Domo transforms to incorporate SSOe data for unlinked ID.me users (200VIDM CSPIDs). | Restores historical credential records for ~12.6k unlinked users and ~40k returning users. Improves accuracy of modern credential adoption reporting.       | Steve Dickson    |
| 23 |2025-05-07     | Streamlined the IAM MPI user credential dataflow by removing a redundant dependency ("IAM MPI User Credentials - latest snapshot v2") and consolidating logic to consume a single derivative dataset ("MHV Expanded Set combined with IAM - w basic mach no"). | Reduced sequencing complexity and ensured charts render consistently from the same unified dataset.       | Dennis O'Neill   |
| 24 | 2025-05-13     | Added Tier 1 support issues graph to Domo dashboard with filter functionality for the four CSPs.       | Request from POs to expand visibility into Tier 1 support volume, alongside existing reports for Tier 2 & 3 issues. | Dennis O'Neill |
| 25 | 2025-05-28     | Updated dashboard to include ID.me and Login.gov credentials from VA.gov authentication transaction data.       | There is a known issue where users who log in with credentials new to VA via the VAHB/SiS are not getting added to the AuthDB database and weren't being represented in reports.  This has accounted for about 50K additional Veterans who are now correctly being reported as having modern credentials. | Steve Dickson |
| 26 | 2025-05-30     | Removed the following view from Domo: Active, Basic Matched MHV Users (with and without MHV credentials) - Weekly  | Request from PO to remove this from the dashboard, as it is no longer in use.     | Dennis O'Neill    |
| 27 | 2025-05-30 | Updated 4 Credential Segment graphs to use MHV data source for MHV credentials: "Users with ID-verified DS Logon, MHV, ID.me, or Login.gov Credentials" (Weekly & Monthly); "Users with ID-verified DS Logon or MHV Credentials" (Weekly & Monthly) | AuthDB significantly over-reports MHV credentials, leading to inflated totals and inaccurate representation. Switching to the MHV data source ensures more accurate reporting while maintaining AuthDB for other credential types. | Dennis O'Neill
