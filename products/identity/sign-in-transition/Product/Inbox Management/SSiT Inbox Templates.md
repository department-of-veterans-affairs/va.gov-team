### Login.gov
#### Re-Verification Request

Forward to Internal Escalation Pathway + Login.gov

Login.gov Escalation Email Template

Hello All,

We got this from a [role] - I am working with our product owners Jeannette, Samara, and Tom to see what might have prompted the re-verification on the VA side but I wanted to see if there was anything you’d be able to share with us about this Veteran’s account so I can communicate back to the [role]? It seems like [summary of issue]. I have also [summary of actions taken such as gathering additional information from the Veteran, etc.]. Please advise,

Sincerely,

[Name]

Secure Sign-In Transition Team | VA

#### Failed Phone Verification

Hello [name],

If this Veteran was not able to verify their phone with Login.gov they need to verify by mail by following the instructions on the flow. Here’s what it looks like:

Has this Veteran tried ID.me? If not I would see if you can support them in setting up an ID.me account.

Sincerely,

[Name]

Secure Sign-In Transition Team | VA

### ID.me
#### Re-Verification Request

Hello [name],

Thank you for reporting this issue. We have escalated to ID.me for guidance on Veteran [name] account and will let you know what we hear back.

Sincerely,

[Name]

Secure Sign-In Transition Team | VA

#### Escalation to ID.me: forward received email to jessica.guglielmini@id.me

Hello Jessica,

Can you look into this Veteran and see why they’re having to reverify with ID.me after previously setting up their VA account?

Sincerely,

[Name]

Secure Sign-In Transition Team | VA


#### Invalid Birth Certificate

Hello [name],

Thank you for reaching out. The VHIC is considered a form of primary ID, and then the Veteran will need 1-2 other forms of secondary ID to complete this process. Since the birth certificate has issues, does this Veteran have a Social Security card with his name and number? That can be used along with a bank statement with name/address. 

Does this Veteran have a DD214 on file with VBA? If so, that can also be used as a secondary form of ID.

The Veteran will need to get his full name corrected on his birth certificate. Once they have the updated birth certificate they can use that for State ID and can also use that for ID.me verification if they don't have their Social Security Card.

I hope this information is helpful.

Sincerely,

[Name]

Secure Sign-In Transition Team | VA

### If unresolveable, escalate to ID.me for additional support

Response:
Thanks [name]. Let me escalate this to ID.me for additional support. In the meantime, as long as the Veteran has the VHIC and their DD214 they should be able to use both of those plus something like a utility bill to get support but I’ll have ID.me reach out to the Veteran directly.

Sincerely,
[Name]
Secure Sign-In Transition Team | VA
