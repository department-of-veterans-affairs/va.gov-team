# **Identity Verification Issues for Users Under the Age of 18**

**Edge Case:** [Veteran's Dependents Under 18](https://jira.devops.va.gov/browse/SITEC-48)  
**Created:** 10 June 2025

## **Situation**

During an exploration of AskVA guidance from March 7, 2025, to April 18, 2025, following the depreciation of MHV login, the largest number of sign-in cases not related to My HealtheVet access were tied to dependents of Veterans attempting to sign in to apply for Chapter 35 benefits. These benefits include Dependents’ Educational Assistance (DEA), Marine Gunnery Sergeant John David Fry Scholarship, and the Montgomery GI Bill. Similar cases were also identified in an exploration of CSP cases rerouted to the VA during the same period.

Dependents of Veterans applying for [Chapter 35 benefits](https://www.va.gov/family-and-caregiver-benefits/education-and-careers/dependents-education-assistance/rates/) are more likely to be under 18\. Users under 18 cannot verify their identity using ID.me. While Login.gov can technically verify individuals aged 13–18, they may encounter challenges because its current data partners do not maintain identity verification records for minors. In such cases, the user must have a state-issued driver’s license or ID card.

If a Veteran’s dependent applying for Chapter 35 benefits cannot verify their identity, they may complete the process without signing in. However, this alternative process for users unable to log in is not mentioned on the website.

## **Guidance for Affected Users**

According to AskVA guidance, if the dependent of a Veteran is unable to verify when applying for Chapter 35 benefits they can follow the following process:

1. Regarding applying for education, please visit: https://www.va.gov/education/how-to-apply/   
2. Scroll down and select Apply for education benefits then answer the questions provided.  
3. The tool will select the appropriate application for you. However, you must select Continue without signing in or Apply using the paper form. This form will need to be mailed to the appropriate address listed on the application.  
4. Once the education office has processed your application, a COE will be mailed to your residence. You will take the COE to the college of your choice and provide it to the School Certifying Official. The SCO will complete the application for VA to release your funding. If you have questions about VA education benefits, please call 888-442-4551, Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. ET.
