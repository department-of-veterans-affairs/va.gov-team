## Situation 

For deaf and nonverbal Veterans, some verification methods like phone calls or video interactions can pose significant barriers due to communication needs. If the Veteran is unable to complete the self-serve verification process with ID.me or Login.gov, their options become limited and difficult. 

A recurring issue is that Veterans in this situation are unaware of the options available to them and they don’t understand the associated limitations. Oftentimes, deaf/nonverbal Veterans end up in the ID.me video verification flow — due to limited ASL (American Sign Language) support and a lack of familiarity with assistive technology on their device,  it is common for these Veterans to fail verification. Additionally,  we’ve observed and received reports of several accessibility challenges for this group related to video calls, including:
* ID.me’s video verification can be unreliable on older devices. If technical problems occur, ID.me will first attempt to call the Veteran by phone and then arrange a Zoom call to complete verification. This process can be challenging, especially for Veterans who are deaf or hard-of-hearing.  
* On mobile devices, users who rely on ASL must prop up their device to sign effectively, which can be challenging.  

## Alternative options if ID.me and Login.gov self-serve verification fails

| Option | Description | Suitability for Deaf/Nonverbal Veterans | Potential Limitations |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| ID.me In-Person Verification | Verify at participating UPS Stores by booking an appointment with QR code and ID documents. | Highly suitable, as it avoids verbal communication. | Requires physical access to a UPS Store location. |
| ID.me Video Call Verification | Show ID documents on a video call with an ID.me representative, primarily for non-U.S. residents. | Less suitable, as reported challenges with ASL support and technical issues may hinder access. | Accessibility issues for deaf/nonverbal users. |
| Login.gov In-Person  | Verify at USPS by receiving mailer with code and bringing ID documents to the post office. | Highly suitable, as it avoids verbal communication.  | Requires physical access to a USPS location.  |

## Suggestions To Help Veterans

### Improve Awareness of Verification Options

1. Launch a VA-led outreach campaign targeting deaf/nonverbal Veterans, using ASL videos, captioned content, and partnerships with organizations like the National Association of the Deaf.  
2. Update VA websites with a dedicated, easy-to-find section on verification options, including step-by-step ASL guides and FAQs tailored to accessibility needs.  
3. Distribute informational materials through Veteran Service Organizations and VA medical centers.

### Content Considerations

1. **Consider In-Person Verification**: Visit a participating UPS Store (for ID.me) or USPS location (for Login.gov) to verify identity in person, as these options avoid verbal communication. Bring ID documents and, if needed, a QR code for UPS appointments.  
2. **Explore Accessible Resources**: Check VA websites or contact Veteran Service Organizations (e.g., National Association of the Deaf) for ASL videos or guides on verification options.  
3. **Request Assistance**: If video verification is required, ask ID.me for an ASL interpreter or use written communication via the chat box to clarify needs.  
4. **Use Available Tools:** If helpful, look into built-in accessibility features on your device \- like screen readers or captioning tools \- that can support the online verification process.   
5. **Share Your Experience**: If you face barriers during verification, consider providing feedback to the VA, ID.me, or Login.gov to help improve accessibility for others.
