## **Situation**

Veterans with multiple names (e.g., dual first or last names, cultural, or tribal names) may face identity verification issues when accessing VA services. A common scenario involves a mismatch between a state-issued ID and a Veterans Health Identification Card (VHIC) or other public records, where different names are listed due to complex naming conventions, potentially tied to cultural heritage such as Native American descent. This discrepancy causes verification failures after document uploads.

## **Findings**

* **Name Mismatch**: Discrepancies between state IDs, VHIC, and public records (e.g., credit bureaus, DEERS) cause verification failures, as systems expect consistent naming.  
* **Complex Naming Conventions**: Veterans with multiple names, particularly those with cultural or tribal naming practices, encounter issues in government systems designed for standardized formats.  
* **Limitations**: Login.gov and Id.me cannot manually adjust names and requires matching documentation, limiting immediate resolution options.  
* **Alternative Options**: Login.gov and ID.me offer alternative verification methods, such as video calls or in-person verification, which may accommodate name discrepancies with additional documentation.   
* **DEERS Role**: Mismatches may stem from DEERS, which underpins VA records and benefits access. Updating DEERS to include aliases or alternate names requires documentation and Veteran consent.

## **Recommendations for Veterans**

1. **Pursue ID.me Verification**:  
   * Attempt ID.me verification using documents matching the VHIC or public records (e.g., VHIC, passport, Social Security card). Use video calls or in-person verification (e.g., at a UPS store) to explain name discrepancies, referencing cultural naming conventions if applicable.  
2. **Try In-Person Login.gov Verification**:  
   * Visit a participating U.S. post office for Login.gov in-person verification with the state ID. Confirm the locationâ€™s capability to handle the process.  
3. **Engage VA for Record Reconciliation**:  
   * Contact the VA eligibility department or a My HealtheVet coordinator to discuss adding alternate names or aliases to VA systems or DEERS without changing the primary name. Provide supporting documentation (e.g., state ID, VHIC, tribal enrollment card, or affidavit).
