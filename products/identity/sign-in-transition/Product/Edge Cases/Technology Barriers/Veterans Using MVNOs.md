## **Definitions**

**MVNOs (Mobile Virtual Network Operators)**: MVNOs are wireless providers that do not own their own network infrastructure but instead lease access from MNOs. Examples include Mint Mobile (T-Mobile), Visible (Verizon), and Consumer Cellular (AT\&T). MVNOs often offer cost-effective plans, making them popular among Veterans, especially those on fixed incomes.

## **Situation**

Some Veterans are encountering challenges with identity verification linked to their use of Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs. The problems primarily arise during phone-based verification methods, such as SMS or voice call multi-factor authentication (MFA), due to limitations in certain MVNO plans or network performance. This report outlines issues with MVNOs and provides alternative options for Veterans facing these challenges.

## **Issues with MVNOs**

* **Data-Only Plans**: Some MVNOs offer data-only plans (e.g., for tablets or hotspots) that lack SMS or voice support, preventing Veterans from receiving verification codes via phone-based methods.  
* **Network Deprioritization**: MVNOs often have lower network priority than MNOs during peak times, which can delay or prevent SMS delivery, especially in areas with poor coverage or high congestion.  
* **Device Compatibility**: Veterans using older or budget devices provided by MVNOs may face issues if the device lacks modern features (e.g., internet access for authenticator apps) or is not fully compatible with the MVNOâ€™s host network.  
* **International Roaming**: MVNOs with limited or no international roaming support may cause verification issues for Veterans traveling abroad, as phone-based verification may not function.

## **Alternative options and conclusion**

MVNOs are generally compatible with Login.gov and ID.me, but data-only plans, network issues, or outdated devices may disrupt phone-based verification. Veterans experiencing issues with multi-factor authentication (MFA) can use alternative, non-phone-based methods provided by both ID.me and Login.gov. ID.me offers video verification and in-person verification at UPS locations. Login.gov provides in-person verification at USPS locations.
