# Easy to Reference Support for Veterans in the Philippines Credential Transition  
https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/identity-documentation/issues/658

**Problem**  
Veterans in Manila (and potentially other international regions) currently lack up-to-date support resources to transition from DS Logon to ID.me. Without additional support, successful credential migration â€” and continued Veteran access to VA services â€” is at risk. They have requested a webinar, and we are coordinating these efforts.

## Goal  
Provide Veterans in the Philippines with timely, accessible guidance to transition to ID.me by hosting a dedicated webinar.  

ðŸ“… **Webinar Date:** September 23 (US) / September 24 (Philippines)

## Deliverables  

1. **Feedback Review & Recommendations**  
   - âœ… Met with Stephanie-Joy and/or requestor to gather input on common issues and questions.  
   - âœ… Reviewed attendee feedback and questions from the prior Manila training.  

2. **Content Simplification**  
   - Adapted the existing training deck into a [streamlined, easy-to-digest version](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OotMEBP_TkOEyAgAk5onaWFCoYuDReD_/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=108028170385042319167&rtpof=true&sd=true), incorporating lessons learned from the earlier session.  

3. **Training Delivery (One-off Webinar for Manila & Region)**  
   - âœ… Identified ID.me representative (jeethendran.jayasekar@id.me). Slides shared for review (48-hour turnaround).  
   - âœ… Scheduled **9/16 prep call** with ID.me to confirm support pathways and validate prior attendees received help.  
   - Deliver webinar with ID.me participation.  
   - Ensure attendee questions are answered (live or follow-up).  
     - Note: Webinar chat is private (only visible to our team and ID.me).  
   - Establish and communicate escalation path: post-webinar issues directed to ID.me Customer Support via VAâ€™s dedicated email channel.

4. **Outcome Tracking**  
   - Coordinate with ID.me and Manila office to confirm successful credential creation and identify remaining gaps.  
   - Define post-training report (TBD).
