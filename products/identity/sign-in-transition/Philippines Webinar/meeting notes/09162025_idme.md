# Agenda: VA <> ID.me Coordination Call  

**Date:** 9.16  
**Attendees:** VA Identity Team, ID.me Representative  

---

## 1. Welcome & Introductions (5 min)  
- Quick round of introductions  
- Context setting: webinar goals + support for Veterans in the Philippines  

## 2. Escalation Path (5 min)  
- Confirm agreed-upon escalation process for Veteran issues  
*Case by case --- they are willing to send contact info to veterans on the call
*The way zoom is setup, we can either respond to the group or individually
*Should we have a side bar on slack (Jess or JJ will create this slack thread)
*Identity needs to add the id.me folks to the zoom ahead of time as a contributer -- jeethendran.jayasekar@id.me
*Va.support@id.me (internal to our team only)
*Chatbot - 
So if you go to help.id.me, you will see the chat icon in the bottom right corner. They have to start a chat with our chatbot Roy, it will ask them what partner they are trying to access, they will need to state Veterans Affairs and then speak to a representative and it will connect them with a live agent!
