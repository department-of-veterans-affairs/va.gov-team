# Secure Sign-In Transition (MO Team) – ReadMe
Last updated: March 20, 2025

## Program Scope & Value  
The VA Secure Sign-In Transition is a critical modernization effort designed to enhance security, improve usability, and streamline access to Veteran-facing digital services. By retiring redundant sign-in methods and adopting industry-standard authentication protocols, this effort fortifies privacy protections while delivering a smoother, more secure digital experience for Veterans. The goal is to empower Veterans to effortlessly and securely access the benefits and services they rely on, free from the barriers of outdated login systems.  

## The Transition Plan  
VA is retiring two legacy credentialing systems and transitioning to more secure, NIST-compliant authentication services:  

- **My HealtheVet (MHV) username and password** retired after **March 4, 2025**.  
- **DS Logon username and password** retires after **September 30, 2025**.  
- Veterans will transition to **Login.gov** and/or **ID.me** to securely access VA services online.  

## Challenges & Barriers  
Despite its benefits, this transition presents challenges:  

- **Awareness gaps** – Many Veterans are unaware of the changes, reasons for the change, or what actions they need to take.  
- **Adoption resistance** – Some Veterans are hesitant to switch, unable to make the changes on their own, or lack trust in the new systems.  
- **Access & digital literacy** – Barriers include broadband limitations, unfamiliarity or access to modern technology, disability or delegate-related challenges, and lack of required ID documentation for verification.  
- **Low success rates** – Remote identity verification success rates are under 50%, necessitating additional support solutions that offer localized, direct assistance to Veterans in the field.  

## Our Approach to Supporting Veterans  
To ensure a smooth transition, our team is executing a multi-pronged engagement strategy that blends direct, Veteran-facing support with data-driven insights, ensuring Veterans can navigate changes while equipping VA with the information needed to drive better outcomes:  

### 1. Direct Veteran Outreach & VA Staff Enablement  
- Host **nationwide sign-up events** at VA Medical Centers to assist with account creation and verification.  
- Gather **on-the-ground insights** to refine the transition process for staff & Veterans.  
- Conduct **targeted training sessions** to equip VA staff with the knowledge to guide Veterans through the process.  
- Contribute to **how-to materials, resource materials, troubleshooting guides**, and improve escalation pathways for Veteran issues.  

### 2. Data-Driven Decision Making  
- Track **adoption trends** and **login activity** across credentialing systems.  
- Provide **weekly and monthly reports** to inform strategic decision-making.  
- Ensure **data accuracy and integration** with VA systems.  

### 3. Issue Identification & Resolution  
- Maintain a **catalog of identity verification blockers** (“edge cases”) to track and resolve challenges.  
- Collaborate with **Login.gov, ID.me, and VA teams** to implement solutions and mitigate issues.  
- Proactively **eliminate barriers preventing Veteran access**.  

### 4. Comprehensive Support & Resources  
- Manage a **sign-in transition support inbox** where staff can securely escalate Veteran issues or sentiment, identify transition trends and impact across the country, and coordinate event planning & training with VA staff.  
- Develop and distribute **collateral and guidance materials** for VA personnel.  

## Key Accomplishments (Last 6 Months)  
- Organized **150+ nationwide sign-up events** at VA facilities and trained **450+ VA employees** to provide in-person Veteran support.  
- Integrated **5 data sources** to deliver **weekly reports** quantifying Veterans without modern credentials; insights helped to inform VA leadership’s decision to extend the **MHV sunset date from January to March 2025**.  
- Developed an **Edge Case Catalog** to identify **20+ transition blockers**, align them to solutions, and monitor progress toward resolution.  
- Escalated **365+ Veteran cases** to direct VA & CSP support.  
- Designed & deployed **support materials** for VA medical staff and call centers.
