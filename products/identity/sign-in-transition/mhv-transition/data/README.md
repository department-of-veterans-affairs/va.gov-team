# Data and Analytics

Last updated: August 16, 2024

## Overview

Data will provide the pulse of the My HealtheVet Sign-in Transition. It will help us understand the health of the transition, when to iterate or change direction, and when the transition is complete.

## Problems to solve

This initiative should address the following problem areas:

* **[User behavior:](./user-behavior.md)** what is the status of the transition? How many Veterans still need to move to a modern credential?

* **Strategy:** How do we support, measure, and iterate on the things we do to facilitate the sign-in transition?

* **Credential health:** Are the modern credentials performing as we expect?

* **Awareness and visibility:** How do we ensure the right people have the right level of information about the sign-in transition?

* **Holistic Data:** How do we develop a clear and accurate understanding of the sign-in transition across all of VA, not just VA.gov and the mobile app?
