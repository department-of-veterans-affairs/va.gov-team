## POCs
- **Slack channel**: [Sign-in transition](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/secure-sign-in-transition)

## Overview

In July 2024, VA publicly announced its decision to retire the My HealtheVet user ID and password and use of the DS Logon credential at VA. Instead, VA would only continue to support two modern, NIST-compliant credentials -- Login.gov and ID.me -- going forward.

Between July 2024 and March 2025, VA engaged in an organization-wide campaign to migrate about 1M MHV users to Login.gov and ID.me. As of 3/6/2025, the MHV user ID and password option has been completely removed from VA web and mobile properties. 

## User Problem Statement

- As a Veteran, I need to be able to quickly and easily login to VA web properties to manage my health and benefits.
- As a Veteran, I need to sign up for a Login.gov or ID.me account, having previously used the MHV or DSL credentials to login to VA web properties.

## Business goals

- Reduce the number of people using the My HealtheVet user ID and password to zero.
- Improve security and reduce fraud risk by retiring the My HealtheVet user ID and password.
- Simplify the VA sign-in experience by reducing supported credential service providers from four to two.

- **December 2024 to March 2025**: Urgent alert and assistance —“You must make this change now to continue to access and manage our benefits online. Get support now.”​
- **March 2025 and beyond**: Post-transition support — “Use your Login.gov or ID.me account to sign in. If you don’t have one, create one now.”​

#### Completed work

- [MHV] Allowed people to voluntarily retire their MHV usernames and passwords.​
- [MHV] Ended the ability to create a new MHV username and password.​
- [MHV] Redesigned the MHV sign-in page to emphasize VA.gov sign-in path and de-emphasize direct MHV sign-in (Option 2) and AccessVA (Option 3).
