# Easy to Reference Support for Veterans in the Philippines Credential Transition  
https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/identity-documentation/issues/658

**Problem**  
Veterans in Manila (and potentially other international regions) currently lack up-to-date support resources to transition from DS Logon to ID.me. Without additional support, successful credential migration — and continued Veteran access to VA services — is at risk. They have requested a webinar, and we are coordinating these efforts.

**Goal**  
Ensure that Veterans in the Philippines receive additional support in transitioning to id.me via a webinar.

**Webinar scheduled for 9.23 US; 9.24 Philippines**

## Deliverables  

1. **Feedback Review & Recommendations**
   
   - **DONE** Connect with Stephanie-Joy + requestor to understand [what questions have been coming up](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/identity-documentation/issues/659#issuecomment-3250116327), what are additional issues, what else should we know?
   - **DONE** Review feedback and attendee questions from the previous Manila training.

2. **Content Simplification & chunk it out**  
   - Adapt the existing deck into a [streamlined, more digestible presentation.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OotMEBP_TkOEyAgAk5onaWFCoYuDReD_/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=108028170385042319167&rtpof=true&sd=true) Utilize feedback from initial presentation.

2. **Training Delivery (One-off Manila, and surrounding locations, Webinar)**     
- **DONE** Determine who the IDme rep is and deliver slides to them so they can ensure the info is as up to date as possible
_Rep is jeethendran.jayasekar@id.me; they asked they we give them 48 hours for feedback turnaround._ 
_We have a call with them on 9.16 and will ask them about users last time to ensure they received help + if we can provide them a list of registrants to check where they are int he process before the call_
- Deliver September webinar in partnership with ID.me to meet Philippines' users immediate need.  
   - Ensure attendee questions are answered (live or follow-up).  
     _The webinar is setup to NOT allow messages to be seen amoung other attendees - only our team and id.me_
   - Ensure escalation path with id.me and how to get continued follow up from id.me
     _For questions and concerns after the call, we should direct users to the Customer Support email. This is only for escalations coming from VA specifically. Samara has the information on this._

3. **Outcome Tracking**  
   - Coordinate with ID.me and Manila office to validate conversion outcomes. 
     _TBD_ 

## Requirements for webinar
- **DONE** ID.me representation needs to be in attendance and assist in preparation with finalizing the webinar [done]
- **DONE** Particpatnts cannot unmute themselves [this is setup via the webinar settings]
- **DONE** Participants comments and questions should not be visibile to other participants [this is setup via the webinar settings]

## Success Metrics  
- Post-training follow-up shows measurable increase in successful ID.me credential creation.
