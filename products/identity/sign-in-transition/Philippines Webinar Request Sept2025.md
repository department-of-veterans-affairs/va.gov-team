# Easy to Reference Support for Veterans in the Philippines Credential Transition  
https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/identity-documentation/issues/658

**Problem**  
Veterans in Manila (and potentially other international regions) currently lack up-to-date support resources to transition from DS Logon to ID.me. Without additional support, successful credential migration — and continued Veteran access to VA services — is at risk. They have requested a webinar, and we are coordinating these efforts.

**Goal**  
Ensure that Veterans in the Philippines receive additional support in transitioning to id.me via a webinar.

**Date TBD; potential for 9.24**

## Deliverables  

1. **Feedback Review & Recommendations**
   
   -  Connect with Stephanie-Joy + requestor to understand what questions have been coming up, what are additional issues, what else should we know?
   - Review feedback and attendee questions from the previous Manila training.
Categorize into:
* Users that requested follow-up + relay information to IDme to ensure tickets were resolved. If not, request follow-up.
* Improvements for the presentation deck
*Information ID.me should be prepared to address during live Q&A

2. **Content Simplification & chunk it out**  
   - Adapt the existing deck into a streamlined, more digestible presentation. Utilize feedback from initial presentation.

2. **Training Delivery (One-off Manila, and surrounding locations, Webinar)**     
- Determine who the IDme rep is and deliver slides to them so they can ensure the info is as up to date as possible
- Deliver September webinar in partnership with ID.me to meet Philippines' users immediate need.  
   - Ensure attendee questions are answered (live or follow-up).  
   - Ensure escalation path with id.me and how to get continued follow up from id.me

3. **Outcome Tracking**  
   - Coordinate with ID.me and Manila office to validate conversion outcomes.  

## Requirements for webinar
- ID.me representation needs to be in attendance and assist in preparation with finalizing the webinar
- Particpatnts cannot unmute themselves
- Participants comments and questions should not be visibile to other participants
- Committed escalation path



## Success Metrics  
- Post-training follow-up shows measurable increase in successful ID.me credential creation.  
- A reusable training package is created and can be deployed without starting from scratch.
