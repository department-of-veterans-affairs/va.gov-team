# User actions content guide
A pattern to write and scale event types and event descriptions for user action events in the [audit database](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity/Products/delegate%20access%20#2-audit-database---immutable-logs-of-delegate-actions-for-compliance) and [user actions view](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity/Products/delegate%20access%20). 

## Overview
- User action event records include: 
  - **Event type**: categories of access events, currently includes: sign in, profile, payments, documents, forms
  - **Event description**: describes the user action taken and the specific resource accessed or updated
  - **Identifier:** unique types of user action events referenced for investigation purposes.
- For the MVP this list of user actions is focused on sign-in events and access events that **update** database resources.

### Terminology
- **Access event:** an action where sensitive information is accessed or updated in a database by a user or system
- **Audit database:** logs for access events stored on vets-api and Amazon Web Services (AWS) for 7 years
- **Resource:** types of sensitive information accessed in a database, such as: password, direct deposit, or mailing address
- **User action:** a verb used to describe accessing or updating resources in a database, such as: create, update, or add
- **User actions view:** a user-facing dashboard view of actions taken on a user record

## How to write event descriptions
### Guidelines
- Describe the user action taken and the specific resource accessed or updated. 
- If applicable, include the related form, document, or benefit name.
- Write user actions in the present tense, not past tense, because events also include a status: Initial, Success, or Error.
- Most event descriptions start with one of these verbs: Add, Create, Update, Submit, Download.
  - Use "Add" for user actions that can be completed more than once.
  - Use "Create" for user actions that can only be completed once, such as creating an account with a CSP.
  - Use "Update" for changes to existing resources.
- Write in sentence case. Only include title case to reflect the capitalization of a specific form or document title.

### Pattern
{{ User action }} {{ Resource accessed or updated }} {{ Specific form, document, or benefit }}

### Examples
- Add  direct deposit  for pension
- Submit VA Form 21-10210 Lay/Witness Statement
- Sign in on VA.gov

## How to write identifiers 
### Guidelines
- Describe the user action taken and the type of resource accessed or updated.
- Include enough information to identify the related form, document, or benefit.
- Write user actions in the present tense, not past tense, because events also include a status: Initial, Success, or Error.
- Most identifiers start with one of these verbs: add, create, update, submit, download.

### Pattern
action_resource_identifying-information

### Examples
- add_direct_deposit_disability
- update_va_1010ez
- sign_in
