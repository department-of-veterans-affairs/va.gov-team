* Thank you for joining this session today! I first want to make sure that we're able to hear each other.  
* [WAIT FOR RESPONSE]- if you can’t hear, [troubleshoot](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/troubleshooting-for-va-gov-research-sessions-in-pr#Troubleshootingresearchsessions-Problem:Usercannothearyou/youcan'thearthemonZoom) otherwise...]  
* Great! I’m [YOUR NAME] and I’m a researcher for VA.gov.  
* I also have [NOTE TAKER NAME] here today to take some notes. I’ll ask them to introduce themself.  
   * [PAUSE FOR NOTE TAKER to introduce themself]  
* I'd also love for you to tell us a little about yourself.
   * [PAUSE FOR PARTICIPANT to introduce themself]

* The subject of our research today is to better understand the caregiver experience at the VA.   
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. The goal is to improve this process to better meet Veterans needs. We will not be offended by any opinions you express, and we welcome your candid feedback.  
* This entire session will take no more than 30 minutes.  
* I do want you to be as comfortable as possible, so if for any reason and at any time you want to pause or even stop the session, please let me know.  
* Any questions so far?
---

* Let’s have each of our observers quickly go around and introduce themselves with cameras on, please.  
  * \[PAUSE for observers to introduce themselves\]  
* Ok and now I’ll ask our notetakers and observers to mute themselves and turn off their cameras for the remainder of the sessions to save on distractions and to save Zoom bandwidth.  
* We sometimes use written quotes from our notes to help others at the VA understand why we want to make certain changes, but your name and information will not be directly linked to any of your comments. Are you comfortable with that?  
* I'd also like to ask your permission to record our discussion today. This helps us if we need to look back for clarifications like to make sure we noted your opinions correctly. We delete recordings after we finish analysis, which usually takes a couple weeks. Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and our audio as we talk today?  
  * \[IF YES \- RECORD TO CLOUD\]  
  * Now that we're recording, I have to confirm once more \- are you are ok if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?  
* \[WAIT FOR RESPONSE\]  
* Ok, that's it for set up\! Do you have any questions on any of this setup stuff before we start?
