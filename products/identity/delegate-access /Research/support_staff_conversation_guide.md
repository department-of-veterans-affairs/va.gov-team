## **Starting the session | 5 minutes**

* [Have your camera on]
* Thank you for joining this session today! I first want to make sure that we're able to hear each other.  
* [WAIT FOR RESPONSE]- if you can’t hear, [troubleshoot](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/troubleshooting-for-va-gov-research-sessions-in-pr#Troubleshootingresearchsessions-Problem:Usercannothearyou/youcan'thearthemonZoom) otherwise...]  
* Great! I’m [YOUR NAME] and I’m a researcher for VA.gov.  
* I also have [NOTE TAKER NAME] here today to take some notes. I’ll ask them to introduce themself.  
   * [PAUSE FOR NOTE TAKER to introduce themself]  
* I'd also love for you to tell us a little about yourself.
   * [PAUSE FOR PARTICIPANT to introduce themself]  
* Nice to meet you!

* The subject of our research today is to better understand the caregiver experience at the VA.   
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. The goal is to improve this process to better meet Veterans needs. We will not be offended by any opinions you express, and we welcome your candid feedback.  
* This entire session will take no more than 30 minutes.  
* I do want you to be as comfortable as possible, so if for any reason and at any time you want to pause or even stop the session, please let me know.  
* Any questions so far?
---

* Let’s have each of our observers quickly go around and introduce themselves with cameras on, please.  
  * \[PAUSE for observers to introduce themselves\]  
* Ok and now I’ll ask our notetakers and observers to mute themselves and turn off their cameras for the remainder of the sessions to save on distractions and to save Zoom bandwidth.  
* We sometimes use written quotes from our notes to help others at the VA understand why we want to make certain changes, but your name and information will not be directly linked to any of your comments. Are you comfortable with that?  
* I'd also like to ask your permission to record our discussion today. This helps us if we need to look back for clarifications like to make sure we noted your opinions correctly. We delete recordings after we finish analysis, which usually takes a couple weeks. Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and our audio as we talk today?  
  * \[IF YES \- RECORD TO CLOUD\]  
  * Now that we're recording, I have to confirm once more \- are you are ok if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?  
* \[WAIT FOR RESPONSE\]  
* Ok, that's it for set up\! Do you have any questions on any of this setup stuff before we start?

## **General Questions | 15-25 minutes**

* Can you tell me a little bit about yourself and your role at the VA?
* Have you worked with or interacted with caregivers or fiduciaries in the past?  Can you give me your impressions on how that process works at the VA?
* How have you supported or been asked to support caregivers/fiduciaries in the past? Can you describe your role working with caregivers/proxies/someone supporting a Veteran?  
  * Has one approached you or reached out to you directly for support?
    * Can you tell me more about that interaction? [If they don't mention how they validated they had permissions, probe them on this.]
    * What specific issue or request did they come to you with?
    * Were you able to assist them?
      * If so, how?
      * If not, how? Did you provide them with additional materials?  Direct them to other resources e.g. other departments, VA.gov website, etc.?
* When you're unsure about something, how have you gotten support? [Try to figure out what steps they take to get answers to unknowns in the caregiver space.]
* What are some protocols/policies that you have to adhere to when speaking to/supporting caregivers?
           
* Is there anything else that you would like us to know about your interactions with caregivers/fiduciaries?
