## **Starting the session | 5 minutes**
[There are 3 sessions where the participant is joining via phone.  If this is the case, you can still follow the same protocol to "allow" people into the Zoom.]
* [Have your camera on]
* Thank you for joining this session today! I first want to make sure that we're able to hear each other.  
* [WAIT FOR RESPONSE]- if you can’t hear, [troubleshoot](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/troubleshooting-for-va-gov-research-sessions-in-pr#Troubleshootingresearchsessions-Problem:Usercannothearyou/youcan'thearthemonZoom) otherwise...]  
* Great! I’m [YOUR NAME] and I’m a researcher for VA.gov.   
* I'd also love for you to tell us a little about yourself.
   * [PAUSE FOR PARTICIPANT to introduce themself]  
* Nice to meet you!
* The subject of our research today is to better understand the caregiver experience at the VA on. Today, we're going to talk about how manage VA benefits and health care for the Veteran you care for.    


* We do have a couple other team members in the waiting room who would like to observe and help take notes. But before we invite them, I'd like to tell you more about what we're doing today.
* **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
  - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
  - If yes: Admit observers.
   - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
   - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
* Any questions so far?
 
* We sometimes use written quotes from our notes to help others at the VA understand why we want to make certain changes, but your name and information will not be directly linked to any of your comments. Are you comfortable with that?  
* I'd also like to ask your permission to record our discussion today. This helps us if we need to look back for clarifications like to make sure we noted your opinions correctly. We delete recordings after we finish analysis, which usually takes a couple weeks. Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and our audio as we talk today?  
  * \[IF YES \- RECORD TO CLOUD\]  
  * Now that we're recording, I have to confirm once more \- are you are ok if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?  
* \[WAIT FOR RESPONSE\]  
* Ok, that's it for set up\! Do you have any questions on any of this setup stuff before we start?

## Thank-You and Closing - 1 minute

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
