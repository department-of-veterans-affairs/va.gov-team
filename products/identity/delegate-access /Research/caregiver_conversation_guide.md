   * [PAUSE FOR PARTICIPANT to introduce themself]  
* Nice to meet you!  
* We do have a couple other team members in the waiting room who would like to observe and help take notes. But before we invite them, I'd like to tell you more about what we're doing today.  
* The subject of our research today is to better understand the caregiver experience at the VA on.   
* Today we're going to talk about how manage VA benefits and health care for the Veteran you care for.  
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. The goal is to improve this process to better meet Veterans needs. We will not be offended by any opinions you express, and we welcome your candid feedback.  
* This entire session will take no more than 30 minutes.

* Ok, let’s get to the folks we have waiting to join the session. Are you ok that they join us now to take notes and listen in as we chat?
  * \[If NO\]: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.  
  * \[If YES\]: Admit observers.  
* Let’s have each of our observers quickly go around and introduce themselves with cameras on, please.  
  * \[PAUSE for observers to introduce themselves\]  
* Ok and now I’ll ask our notetakers and observers to mute themselves and turn off their cameras for the remainder of the sessions to save on distractions and to save Zoom bandwidth.  
* We sometimes use written quotes from our notes to help others at the VA understand why we want to make certain changes, but your name and information will not be directly linked to any of your comments. Are you comfortable with that?  
* I'd also like to ask your permission to record our discussion today. This helps us if we need to look back for clarifications like to make sure we noted your opinions correctly. We delete recordings after we finish analysis, which usually takes a couple weeks. Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and our audio as we talk today?  
  * \[IF YES \- RECORD TO CLOUD\]  
  * Now that we're recording, I have to confirm once more \- are you are ok if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
