## Research Goals

* Discover how caregivers are able to access Veteran services behalf of Veterans
* Explore how caregivers interact with VA.gov or other digital services  
* Better understand and empathhize with the caregiver journey and uncover any potential pain points as they navigate the VA

### **Outcome**  
Learn about the process of how caregivers are able to complete various tasks and functions on behalf of Veterans. The focus is anything from the point of being designated by the Veteran all the way through completion of any actions behalf of a Veteran.

### **Research questions**
  
- Which methods does the caregiver utilize to complete actions on behalf of the Veteran?
  - Is the caregiver given digital access?
- What functions do caregivers do on behalf of the Veteran most frequently?
- How is a delegate currently authorized and designated as a caregiver?  What actions must the Veteran take?
- How might a Veteran assign permissions for a caregiver? For what period of time is the designation active?

## **Methodology**

- Interview caregivers who have completed various actions on behalf of Veterans
- Interview VA personnel who interact with Veteran healthcare benefits.

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach

We will use Perigean to recruit Veteran representatives who are representatives for Veterans that require assistance with accessing their healthcare benefits  for this moderated study. 

### Recruitment criteria

12 for at least 8 completed sessions

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
All participants:
- Must have a computer or mobile phone and be willing to complete the interview remotely
- Must have a working microphone
- In addition our primary product criteria includes:
   - Must be a representative for a Veteran for at least 3 months.
   - Must have completed a healthcare action on behalf of a Veteran.
- Use of Zoom or sharing of a screen is not necessary for this study.

Our primary diversity and inclusion criteria:
- 2 persons cognitive disabilities

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

1. Veterans can designate specific permissions that caregivers may have.
   - **False** - 
2. Caregivers do not currently have access to digitally complete actions on behalf of the Veteran they are caring for.
   - **Partially True** - 
3. Caregivers have a desire to leverage digital tools to complete actions on behalf of Veterans.
   - **Partially True** - 
4. Non-digital mechanisms for accessing healthcare beneifts are difficult to maneuver.
   -  **Partially True**
5. With the deprecation of MHV, there has been a significant roadblock for representatives/caregivers to digitally monitor and complete actions for Veterans in their care.
   -  **Unconfirmed**
  
## Previous Research

There have been numerous efforts by many in the VA at all levels that have evaluated the issues caregivers face.  These caregivers play a critical role in helping Veterans manage benefits and healthcare, yet existing systems don’t formally support digital access on a Veteran’s behalf.    
There have been many teams that have come before the Identity team; we wanted to learn from their efforts and experience while we considered how the Identity team could potentially assist caregivers.

We looked at data points that were relevant to the questions we had so this recap is not comprehensive but calls out things as they relate to our research.

* * [2024-10 Caregiver study](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1726173728303/0cf8beb343b2e2ed0a84d4afc9732e3bf40d3ad0)  
  * This research focused primarily on form 10-10CG but there were some findings as related to caregivers in general.  
    * Many caregivers wanted to know what eligibility and benefits they and their Veterans qualified for prior to applying.  
    * The caregiver program brought up negative feelings and feelings of confusion.  
    * In terms of caregiver roles, there was quite a bit of confusion between the various types of roles and there was an expectation that the nuances be spelled out.  
* [Liz Lantz](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/8c46b257b67a9d28fbaa3cda92115671ed48cfcc/products/identity/Research/user-roles/discovery/non-veteran-user-roles-discovery-phase-1.md) in Nov 2021 completed discovery into the non-Veteran user roles space.   
  * Caregivers are not a support role in eBenefits  
  * MPI added a person data type data point in 2019\.  However, this list is not a 1:1 relationship with MHV.  
  * MPI can store a delegate after a Veteran designates them as such  
  * They have the ability to: Refill prescriptions online, manage self-reported Veteran information regarding medication, supplements, and health journals, write and respond to Secure Messages.  
* [The Digital Health Modernization Team](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/pre-mhv-prototype/generative-research-study-1/research-findings.md) completed a generative research study in 2022 and found that:  
  * Veterans and caregivers did not go to [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) to do tasks but completed most of those actions on MyHealtheVet.  
  * There was frustration that although a caregiver was given permission to complete actions on behalf of a Veteran, there was no way to distinguish between who completed which action and that caused “friction and confusion”. 

## Key Findings

1. **The burden of being a caregiver is heavy.**
* **Insight:** Caregivers who work with their loved ones seemed overwhelmed.  Some are able to find support, but others are really struggling.  
    * **Key Quote**: "When you have a significant other, there's a lot of things they do. The frustrating part for me was trying to help her take care of the little things.  She had so many tasks I needed to help with it was like "where's my time?" **\- *P4***

2. **Caregiver designation doesn’t equal authorization and/or access.**

  * **Insight:** Although the caregiver support programs can designate a caregiver status, the caregiver is unable to officially complete actions on behalf of a Veteran.  
    * POA & consent forms are used inconsistently & often need to be resubmitted or carried physically. The designations don’t translate to digital access or systemic permissions.  
    * *Insight from stakeholder call – CARMA documents caregiver roles & connects with MPI and EHR. This status does not translate to permissions nor is it portable across channels.*    
  * **Insight:** Expectations for the caregiver programs were often not met.  
      * Many caregivers conflate program enrollment with access or ability to act on behalf of the veteran.
      * Some caregivers reported that community support groups were more helpful than the caregiver support programs.
      
3. **Caregivers are adept at working around the system to get things done.**
  * **Insight:** Caregivers are able to act on Veteran's behalf thru the phone, in-person & online.
  * * **Insight:** Caregivers who used a Veterans' credentials did not seem concerned with security.
  * **Insight from stakeholder call – not officially sanctioned, but many workarounds are tolerated by staff based on familiarity and need.*  

4. **VA systems are fragmented and hard to navigate.**

  * **Insight:** The process of applying for benefits and healthcare can be daunting and overwhelming.  
  * **Insight:** Many caregivers expressed that they had difficulty navigating the VA.  
    * **Key Quote**: "A civilian trying to navigate a military world and lingo has been a learning curve." **\- *P6***  
  * **Insight:** Documentation and resources were hard to find on va.gov.
    * **Key Quote**: ""I think sometimes technology hurts with that [tech silos and bridging gaps]." **\- *P7*** 
  * **Insight:** Since the VBA and VHA are separate entities, caregivers were frustrated with having to navigate both systems separately which felt redundant and unecessary.
  * **Insight from stakeholder call – even when caregivers complete authorization forms, they’re not consistently recognized across services.*

5. **Some interactions are smooth but not consistent across the board.**

  * **Insight:** Highlights of caregiver's interactions were similar.  
    * Prescription refills, medical devices, and provider comms were described as simple and positive. Suggests that once access is established, the tasks are straightforward.

Related to: Hypothesis 2, Hypothesis 3, Question 2

Of the caregivers we spoke to, many reported feeling overwhelmed by the sheer amount of responsibility needed to care for their loved ones (within the VA and external to the VA ecosystem).  Some caregivers reported that they had little to no time for self-care, but they were more than willing to do what it took to support the Veteran they were caring for. Some are able to find support, but others are really struggling. Some reported that they had to take care of everything their loved ones couldn’t do which could encompass “everything”.
Others reported that they were a full time caregiver and that being a caregiver was a full-time job.

Related to: Hypothesis 2, Question 3

POA's and consent forms were what caregivers used to interact with VA staff to speak or complete actions on behalf of Veterans.
However, caregivers reported having to re-submit or carry around POA’s or consent forms multiple times.

This designation did not give them specific access to information or provide any special privileges to act on behalf of a Veteran.

>_"I would have thought that when we were approved for the program but we've never been able to do anything on his behalf." - Participant 3_

There are 2 caregiver support programs:
Program of General Caregiver Support Services (PGCSS) - provides peer  support mentoring, skills training, coaching,  telephone support, online programs, and referrals to available resources to caregivers of Veterans
Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (PCAFC) - offers enhanced clinical support and services for caregivers of eligible Veterans who have a serious injury (or illness) and require in-person personal care services among other requirements.
Has additional benefits like CHAMPVA, monthly stipends and beneficiary travel
Many conflated PCAFC with official caregiver status and were frustrated they couldn’t do “anything”.
A few Veterans report that community support groups have helped them find information.

>_"“There are support meetings and in-person sessions (like an open house) where you can meet people who provide resources.” - Participant 4_


**3. Caregivers are adept at working around the system to get things done.**

Related to: Hypothesis 2
- We intentionally spoke with caregivers who used digital, telephonic or in-person mechanisms to support their Veterans
- Some caregivers prefer using the phone because:
  - They are familiar with utilizing the phone. 
  - One Veteran reported that she called in at 8AM if she needed do get something accomplished so she wouldn’t have to wait in a long queue.
  - Another Veteran reported that they didn’t trust websites
- If caregivers went online, they often used their ward’s accounts
  - If they had their own MyHealtheVet accounts, they were not able to do anything on behalf of the Veteran in their care.
  - Privacy and security were not at the forefront of caregivers’ minds when they were attempting to complete actions.

Related to: Hypothesis 1, Hypothesis 3

- Gaining a disability rating is difficult and time consuming (most emotionally and mentally draining part of the process.
  - Once a Veteran gets a rating, managing benefits is mostly maintenance
- Different staff have different understanding/level of ability to assist Veterans and their caretakers

- Many caregivers expressed frustration at not being able to navigate the VA healthcare system.
  - Until interfacing directly with a VA doctor many Veterans don't know they're eligible for  certain equipment, benefits, etc.
- Website isn’t always forthcoming or easy to find the information a caregiver might need at any given time.

Related to: Hypothesis 1, Question 1, Question 2, Question 3, Question 4

- Obtaining prescription refills on the phone and online is straightforward and simple.
- The process for getting medical devices is quick and easy.

- Very happy with medical care - prompt and straightforward getting wheelchair, ramp, chair glide.

- Doctors and support staff at the VA are helpful with getting Veterans information and documentation they need.

## Compliance and Laws

### Laws

* Federal laws and regulations are mostly focused on privacy, and how different types of delegates can access information  
* Privacy laws are especially concerned with how information can and can’t be shared with someone other than the veteran and how that relationship is established.  
*   
* Consent to someone working in a professional capacity comes with some restrictions, like training or even licensure. But consent to someone working in a personal capacity to a veteran seems to be mostly open, other then the need to express in writing, and so most often on a form. 

### Compliance  
There are two primary legal/privacy concerns when it comes to online delegate access: 

1. Who is making a change (eg. veteran, caregiver, etc)?   
2. Whether that person is approved to make a change (ie. Does that person have legal authority to act on behalf of the person for whom they are making the change?) 

From a technical perspective, we can solve “who is making a change?” by requiring people to sign into VA.gov with their own verified account. What we can’t solve is whether a person is legally allowed to make that change.

* Different legal designations are allowed to do different things (eg. A health care POA might have different capabilities than a court-appointed guardian).   
* Different legal designations are not tracked in a way that is uniform across VA. This means that someone who is a health care POA might need to carry paperwork with them everywhere, and they might need to present it to the pharmacy, the medical team, etc, because VA is not tracking this data in a consumable way. 

From a HIPAA perspective, it sounds like health care POA and court-appointed guardian status are tracked in a patient’s medical record, which means we can not show this to the POA or court-appointed guardian in their VA.gov account (because this means we are showing them info in someone else’s medical record).

## Conclusion

* Based on our conversations, reviewing previous research, and  exploring legal/policy constraints, continuing to explore a technical solution from the Identity Team’s perspective does not make sense.  
* However, we firmly believe that there are things we can do to help caregivers and the Veterans they support.

## Next Steps / additional research

1. Dive deeper into consent/POA pain points.  
   1. **Desired outcome**: Improve the access and/or authorization of caregivers to complete actions    
2. Update documentation  
   1. **Desired outcome**: Caregivers should be able to easily navigate resources and documentation to find what they need.  They should also be able to clearly understand what benefits not only the Veteran but they qualify for.  
3. Obtain behavioral data and observational data from Google Analytics, Facebook community groups, VSignals survey, and etc.  
   1. **Desired outcome**: Obtain a clearer picture of where caregivers are struggling the most, what information they are searching for and develop an understanding of any potential for digital access.  
4. Speak to staff who have interacted with Veterans and their caregivers.  
   1. **Desired outcome**: Staff / front-line people see first hand the issues caregivers are experiencing. How can we better understand what these pain points are and how staff are supporting caregivers? Understand what types of care are currently blocked (or unnecessarily difficult) for Veterans who rely on a caregiver?  
5. Understand technical implementation of CARMA, MPI and Veteran profiles.  
   1. **Desired outcome**: From a technical perspective, data is flowing from "somewhere" to MPI and to a Veteran's profile. How does this work in reality? Can our team leverage any of what's been built so far? How is the CARMA solution being utilized and can we piggyback off of it?  Build an understanding of what tools might be needed to enable a caregiver to have meaningful caregiver status.
