    * it DOES identify that a caregivers exists, who they are, and that they should be part of care convos  
    * No specific flag in CARMA for different types of representative (fiduciary, legal guardian, etc), but there are flags in EHR for caregiver type (primary, secondary)

    * Helps caregivers navigate VA systems  
    * Advocates for caregivers and veterans, but cannot provide care to veterans (restricted funding)  
  * Providers  
    * Consults with providers on what they can do to make caregiver support easier  
    * For example sometimes sharing info is made harder than it needs to be, but including caregivers is important for optimal care outcomes  
      * Sometimes veterans do not like to share certain behaviors with their providers like for PTSD or dementia. Caregivers are much more willing, but need the opportunity, to be validated, and believed  
    * Engaged with every major stakeholder (provider type)  
      * Geriatrics, extended care, other provider specialties  
      * have regular syncs,   
    * Lunch and learns at VAMC level  
    * Builds relationships even with MPI toolkit manager  
* Feedback from caregivers

* Caregiver program communications methods  
  * Mail for official/legal items  
  * Phone for more informal or informational  
  * Aren’t involved in health communications, that up to individual providers

* Best ways to help a veteran who legally or actually can't speak for themselves, like unable to offer consent.  
  * easier if they are official guardians (VA needs paperwork)  
  * incapacity isn't a constant thing \- it comes and goes or only affects some aspects of life  
  * share info through veteran’s MHV secure messaging that the caregiver can access  
  * Building long-term relationships with the veteran and/or caregivers help  
    * \*\*We heard this in convos with caregivers\!

* Biggest hurdle for caregivers with providers  
  * misinformations and misbeliefs by providers on what they can and can't share  
  * a misunderstanding of HIPAA and privacy laws and regulations  
    * Need to confirm with OGC but “in general” if the Veteran is present information can be shared with the caregiver

* Resources the caregiver program offers
