# Caregiver Delegate Access \- Research Summary

*Caregivers play a critical role in helping Veterans manage benefits and healthcare, yet existing systems don’t formally support digital access on a Veteran’s behalf. This preliminary research highlighted how caregivers are navigating this gap. While day-to-day tasks like refilling prescriptions or messaging doctors are often manageable, the barriers emerge earlier (particularly when it comes to consent.) There is a clear opportunity to better support caregivers by making their roles visible, meaningful, and actionable across VA systems.*

## [**Key themes & insights**](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1744298500881/c3f09c9caa61fb778087692a117317a8d5c45fd0?wid=0-1746044302198)

**Weight of Caregiving:**

* **Insight 1**: Caregivers who work with their loved ones seemed overwhelmed.  Some are able to find support, but others are really struggling.  
  * **Key Quote:** "When you have a significant other, there's a lot of things they do. The frustrating part for me was trying to help her take care of the little things.  She had so many tasks I needed to help with it was like "where's my time?" **\- *P4***

**Caregiver designation doesn’t equal access**

* **Insight 2:** Although the caregiver support programs can designate a caregiver status, the caregiver is unable to officially complete actions on behalf of a Veteran.  
  * POA & consent forms are used inconsistently & often need to be resubmitted or carried physically. The designations don’t translate to digital access or systemic permissions.  
  * *Insight from stakeholder call – CARMA documents caregiver roles & connects with MPI and EHR. This status does not translate to permissions nor is it portable across channels.*  
* **Insight 4\*:** Expectations for the caregiver programs were often not met.  
  * Many caregivers conflate program enrollment with access or ability to act on behalf of the veteran.  
* 

**Caregivers work around the system to get things done**

* **Insight 3:** Caregivers are able to act on Veteran's behalf thru the phone, in-person & online.  
  * *Insight from stakeholder call – not officially sanctioned, but many workarounds are tolerated by staff based on familiarity and need.*  
* **Insight 9:** Caregivers who used a Veterans' credentials did not seem concerned with security.

**Systems are fragmented and hard to navigate**

* **Insight 5:** The process of applying for benefits and healthcare can be daunting and overwhelming.  
* **Insight 7:** Many caregivers expressed that they had difficulty navigating the VA.  
  * **Key Quote**: "A civilian trying to navigate a military world and lingo has been a learning curve." **\- *P6***  
* **Insight 8:** Documentation and resources were hard to find on va.gov.  
  * *Insight from stakeholder call – even when caregivers complete authorization forms, they’re not consistently recognized across services.*

**Some interactions are smooth but not consistent across the board.**

* **Insight 6:** Highlights of caregiver's interactions were similar.  
  * Prescription refills, medical devices, and provider comms were described as simple and positive. Suggests that once access is established, the tasks are straightforward.

## *Proposed* [**Next Steps**](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1744298500881/c3f09c9caa61fb778087692a117317a8d5c45fd0?wid=1-1745950098314)

1. **User/Use Case Understanding**  
   1. Gather more qualitative and behavioural data about how caregivers navigate VA tools (analytics, survey data, public forums)  
   2. Conduct staff interviews to map how they verify caregiver access today.  
2. **Consent & designation**  
   1. Inventory how consent/POA is currently submitted, stored, and honored across VHA & VBA.  
   2. Explore legal & policy frameworks for caregiver consent across channels  
      1. Can consent follow someone from phone to digital?  
      2. *Insight from stakeholder call – can we clarify types of legal designations?*  
   3. Determine what formal caregiver status *should* enable and whether it can be meaningfully surfaced in VA systems.  
3. **Technical and data considerations**  
   1. Understand how caregiver designation in CARMA propagates to MPI and downstream systems.  
   2. Identify what, if any, access is granted when someone is listed as a caregiver in MPI  
   3. Clarify how Veteran profiles are shown in relation to caregiver roles (across VHA & VBA?)

## **Outcomes (What this will enable)**

This research helps us evaluate:

* Where the actual gaps lie – it doesn’t look like it’s in daily task completion, but in being formally recognized and trusted as a caregiver.  
  * *Insight from stakeholder call – This includes surfacing caregiver status in a way that’s visible, valid across systems/touchpoints, and actionable without requiring full access to a Veteran’s records.*  
* Whether and how we can support task-based access that is backed by consent, instead of defaulting to full delegate accounts.  
* How caregiver status might become meaningful across systems.  
  * How can we reduce redundancy and improve continuity without requiring every user to abandon workarounds that are already
