## Overview

The identity team has hypothesized that an user actions log will be a requirement for the [delegate access MVP](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity/delegate-access%20#readme). Additionally, there are HIPAA requirements for MHV on VA.gov that require some level of action/activity tracking be visible to users.

## User Problem Statement

TBD

## Business goals

- Meet any legal or compliance requirements around action/activity logs.
- Build something that is low maintance over the time and doesn't require constand feature development from the identity team.
- Make sure this tool meets the needs of multiple features/products (eg. delegate access and MHV on VA.gov).

## Questions and Hypotheses

### Questions

- Is there a legal mandate outside of HIPAA that requires we show user actions/activities on VA.gov?
- Are there differences in between what is required for logging on the backend vs. what needs to be displayed on the frontend?
- What actions are required for the action log?
- Is this feature required for delegate access?

### Hypotheses

TBD

## Challenges and Risks

- TBD

## Timeline

- February 2025: Identity team started work on the activity log.
- April 2025: The identity and cartography teams sync due to overlap in activity log work between the two teams.
