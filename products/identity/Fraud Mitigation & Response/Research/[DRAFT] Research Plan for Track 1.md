# DRAFT Research Plan Track 1: Fraud Landscape Mapping Discovery

## Research Objectives

**Primary Objective:** Identify primary stakeholders and map processes within the VA's fraud ecosystem to inform & define the Identity Team's strategic role in this space. This will enable our team to directly contribute to fraud mitigation while enabling our team to appropriately triage and support downstream delivery asks.

**Secondary Objectives:**
- Identify gaps and overlaps in current fraud prevention/response efforts
- Define the stakeholders and processes between VBA and VHA
- Define ownership boundaries and "rules of engagement"
- Create foundation for a shared fraud playbook
- Establish stakeholder alignment on fraud landscape understanding

## Research Questions

### Phase 1: Ecosystem Mapping
1. **Stakeholder & Role Clarity**
   - Who are the key players in fraud detection, prevention, and response?
   - What are each team's current responsibilities and scope?
   - How do teams currently collaborate (or not) on fraud cases?

2. **Process & Workflow Understanding**
   - What are the end-to-end fraud workflows from detection to resolution?
   - Where do handoffs occur between teams?
   - What triggers escalation or team involvement?

3. **Data & Technology Landscape**
   - What fraud-related data does each team collect/access?
   - What tools and systems are currently in use?
   - How is information shared across teams?

### Phase 2: Gap Analysis
4. **Pain Points & Inefficiencies**
   - Where do fraud cases fall through the cracks?
   - What coordination challenges exist?
   - Where is there duplicated effort or missed opportunities?

5. **Resource & Capability Assessment**
   - What fraud prevention/response capabilities exist vs. what's needed?
   - Where are there resource constraints or skill gaps?

### Phase 3: Validation & Alignment
6. **Solution Validation**
   - Do stakeholders agree with the mapped landscape?
   - Are identified gaps/opportunities accurate and prioritized correctly?
   - What are the most viable partnership opportunities?

## Research Methods

### Phase 1: Ecosystem Mapping 

**1. Stakeholder Interviews (Semi-structured, 60 min each)**
- **Participants:** 
  - BDPR team leads and analysts
  - CSP representatives (Login.gov and ID.me)
  - Security team members (Joe)
  - Leadership/oversight stakeholders

**Interview Guide Topics:**
- Role definition and current fraud-related responsibilities
- Typical fraud case workflows and decision points
- Collaboration touchpoints with other teams
- Data sources, tools, and reporting mechanisms
- Current pain points and challenges
- Success stories and effective practices

**2. Workflow Mapping Workshops**
- **Format:** 2-3 cross-functional workshops with 4-6 participants
- **Activities:** 
  - Journey mapping of fraud cases from detection to resolution
  - Identification of handoff points and decision criteria
  - Data flow mapping across systems and teams

**3. Documentation Review**
- Existing fraud policies, procedures, and playbooks
- System documentation and data dictionaries
- Previous fraud case studies or incident reports
- Organizational charts and team structures

### Phase 2: Gap Analysis 

**4. Validation Interviews (30-45 min each)**
- **Participants:** 6-8 key stakeholders from Phase 1
- **Purpose:** Validate preliminary findings and gap analysis
- **Format:** Share draft ecosystem map and gather feedback

### Phase 3: Validation & Partnership 

**5. Stakeholder Alignment Workshop (2 hours)**
- **Participants:** Representatives from all key teams (8-12 people)
- **Activities:**
  - Present final ecosystem map and findings
  - Collaborative refinement of playbook outline
  - Alignment on ownership boundaries and partnership opportunities
  - Next steps planning

## Participant Recruitment Strategy

**Stakeholder Identification:**
- Work with PO's, BDPR and other stakeholders to identify key contacts
- Ensure representation across different levels (leadership, managers, analysts)

**Recruitment Approach:**
- Initial outreach through project sponsors/leadership endorsement
- Clear communication about research purpose and time commitment
- Flexible scheduling to accommodate stakeholder availability
- Offer to share findings and recommendations with participants

## Deliverables

1. **Fraud Ecosystem Map:** Visual representation of stakeholders, roles, workflows, and data flows
2. **Gap & Opportunity Analysis Report:** Documented findings on coordination challenges and improvement opportunities
3. **Shared Playbook Outline:** High-level framework for detection, prevention, and response ownership
4. **Stakeholder Alignment Summary:** Validated findings and agreed-upon next steps
