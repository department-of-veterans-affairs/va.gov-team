# Research Plan: Understanding Veteran Experiences with Fraud

## Description

This qualitative research study aims to understand the fraud experiences of Veterans who receive VA benefits and services. Through moderated interviews, we will explore the types of identity-related fraud Veterans encounter, their fraud detection and reporting processes, the impact on their lives, and their interactions with VA support systems. This research will inform improvements to VA fraud prevention, detection, and response services to better protect and support Veterans.

The study will focus on Veterans who have experienced various forms of fraud, including but not limited to identity theft, unauthorized access, impersonation, benefits fraud, healthcare fraud, and financial scams targeting Veterans. Understanding these experiences from the Veteran's perspective will help identify gaps in current support systems and opportunities for enhanced fraud prevention and response services.

## Research Questions

### Primary Research Questions

1. What are some types of fraud Veterans experience (that our team may not have heard of)?  What are these experiences like for the Veteran?  
2. How do Veterans typically discover they've been victims of fraud?  
3. What role does the VA play in fraud prevention, detection, and resolution for Veterans?  
   1. Has the Veteran experienced account locking in the past?  What was this experience like for the Veteran?  
4. How effectively does the VA currently support Veterans who experience fraud?  
5. What part do CSPs play in this process?    
   1. Have Veterans received direct communications from [Login.gov](http://Login.gov) or [ID.me](http://ID.me)?  
6. Are there underreported instances of fraud/misuse that don't result in financial harm?  If so, what are the signals that would allow us to identify these cases (earlier)?

### Secondary Research Questions

1. What are the immediate and long-term impacts of fraud on Veterans' lives, including financial, emotional, and health consequences?  
2. What barriers do Veterans face when reporting fraud or seeking help?  
3. How do Veterans' fraud experiences affect their trust in VA services and systems?  
4. What fraud prevention knowledge and resources do Veterans currently have access to?  
5. What additional support would Veterans find most helpful when dealing with fraud?

## Hypotheses

### H1: Detection and Awareness

Veterans often discover fraud through third-party notifications (banks, credit agencies, family members) rather than through proactive monitoring or VA alerts, suggesting opportunities for improved fraud detection systems and coordination and integration with partners where feasible and appropriate.

### H2: VA Support Gaps

While the VA may provide some fraud-related support, Veterans likely experience gaps in coordinated response, particularly when fraud involves multiple systems (healthcare, benefits, financial) or external entities.

### H3: Disproportionate Impact

Fraud has a more significant impact on Veterans than the general population due to factors such as fixed incomes, complex benefit structures, and potential targeting of Veteran-specific benefits and services.

### H4: Resolution Challenges

Complete fraud resolution is often lengthy and incomplete, with Veterans experiencing ongoing consequences even after initial reporting and intervention.

### H5: Trust and Engagement

Fraud experiences negatively impact Veterans' trust in digital services and their willingness to engage with VA online platforms and services.

## Methodology

### Study Design

Qualitative, exploratory study using semi-structured interviews to gather in-depth insights into Veterans' fraud experiences.

### Trauma Informed Approach

Because the topic of fraud is a potentially triggering subject, we want to be careful about approaching this research. We don't want to re-trigger the trauma Veterans have experienced. Our plans include the following:

* During the planning phase we’ll draft emergency exits for both a certain set of questions and for the session as a whole.  
* Our conversation guide will also ease into potentially fraught questions, and be considerate that some participants may choose not to relive these events.   
* We’ll request a review of all Veteran-facing language in the conversation guide with volunteers from the Trauma Informed community of practice  
* We’ll consider if it’s possible to include a social worker in any sessions to help provide support if needed. We’ll ask our POs to help us find someone at the VA if we pursue this.  
* In the recruiting phase we’ll provide an overview of the session for Perigean personnel to share with potential participants and then ask if they are comfortable participating.  
* During research session we’ll limit the number of observers in each session to 4 total people in the Zoom room along with the participant.   
* We’ll also get consent from the participant while the observer is in the Zoom waiting room; if the participant gives consent, then let the observer in.  
* For our team’s well-being we’ll schedule daily debrief meetings to share observations and decompress and share moderating duties
