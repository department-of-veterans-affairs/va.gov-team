# Research Goals

Currently, Veterans log in to va.gov to do things like track a claim, communicate with their doctors, or schedule a doctor's appointment. To do that, Veterans may navigate between multiple platforms to access their benefits and other tools (VA.gov to eBenefits, MHV, or My VA Health). In most cases, they are asked to re-authenticate each time. This results in a fragmented experience that may discourage users from interacting with the VA online.

Our goal with this research was to understand how users currently log in to VA.gov and why they use one credential over the other (MHV, DSLogon, ID.Me). We also wanted to understand the potential impact of sunsetting providers such as MHV and DSLogon.


# Research Questions
1. What research currently exists?
2. What is the current experience for veterans logging in to VA.gov?
3. What usability issues does the design of the sign-in modal present for Veterans?
4. Do Veterans know where to go to get help?
5. What technical issues are they encountering?
6. Do users have a preference of how-to login and why?
7. What tasks do they typically log in for? Where do they typically log in to complete that task?
8. What are the risks of consolidating to just Login.gov and ID.me?
9. What trust issues should we consider as it relates to the current credential options?
10. What are the potential trust issues with login.gov?
11. What are the pain points with identity proofing?
 
## Research Methodology 

- Remote moderated directed interviews
- Remote moderated usability testing with current Va.gov site and low- or high-fidelity mockups

## Hypothesis and Conclusions
We believe that by narrowing down the VA.gov sign in options to two providers, will lead to less frustrating login experience and fewer abandoned sessions.

**Not enough information:**

Most participants chose to continue using the provider they were comfortable and most familiar with. At least 2 of the participants ignored the “Upgrade your account” content displayed before the sign in buttons. When asked to rate the list of providers, Login.gov had an average score of 3 out of 5 because participants did not know anything about the provider. Participants had concerns about the removal of their selected provider (specifically MHV or DS Logon) and they were confused by the word “Upgrade”. One participant assumed this meant they would have to pay for their account to be upgraded. 

## Key Findings
The 5-10 top findings from your study should be listed here. Write your findings so that if someone reads only these bullets they can leave feeling they got useful information and the study was worthwhile. Examples might be "Most participants used the Search field to find the form, and searched for the term 'veteran health'" or "Most participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form". See an example of this section [on the Caregiver findings document](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/1010cg-mvp/usability-testing-jan2020/research-findings.md).

1. Most participants would consider signing in with Login.gov but were hesitant to do so without more information on what was required and how long it would take.
2. Most user journeys start on VA websites such as My HealtheVet or E-benefits.
3. All participants knew where to get help regarding password changes, security images, or site being down.
4. Most participants visit VA websites with specific tasks in mind.
5. All participants were able to successfully in log in
6. All participants stated that security was an important factor in using their credential provider
7. None of the participants expressed a concern with using two-factor authentication


## Details of Findings
List details of each finding in top findings here, with supporting quotes when possible.

1. **Most participants would consider signing in with Login.gov but were hesitant to do so without more information on what was required and how long it would take.**

Keywords: keyword 1, keyword 2 
_List all keywords from the master taxonomy that apply to this finding._

- 4 out of 7 participants said they would use Login.gov if they knew more about the provider and benefits of the account 
- None of the participants were familiar with Login.gov as a credential provider

2. **Most user journeys start on VA websites such as My HealtheVet or E-benefits.** 

Keywords: keyword 1, keyword 2 
_List all keywords from the master taxonomy that apply to this finding._

- When asked to navigate to VA.gov 4 out of 7 participants would search for or enter the address for My HealtheVet or E-benefits

> _Supporting data: “I usually go to “log in” on eBenefits. I have to accept to monitor and enter my username and password.”_

> _Supporting data: “I don’t like VA.gov. It seems to have a lot more outages and downtime than eBenefits. The layout is not as user-friendly as eBenefits either. EBenefits also seems to have a lot more information. I have never had an issue finding what I need on eBenefits vs. VA.gov. I feel like I need a flashlight on VA.gov. ”_


3. **All participants knew where to get help regarding password changes, security images, or site being down**

Keywords: keyword 1, keyword 2 
_List all keywords from the master taxonomy that apply to this finding._

- Participants were often confident that the Contact Us button would lead them to a help area if they had issues with logging in. 3 out of 7 participants mentioned that they would try the phone number listed on the site for additional help

> _Supporting data: “…today I tried to do a contact and it was ugly. It was about my password change – I dialed the phone number on the front of the page and had to call back again because the line was busy. I tried 7 times.”_

> _Supporting data: Quote here_

4. **Most participants visit VA websites with specific tasks in mind.** 

Keywords: keyword 1, keyword 2 
_List all keywords from the master taxonomy that apply to this finding._

- 5 out of 7 participants spent approximately 15 minutes or less on VA websites/ Va.gov, when completing a specific task (i.e. checking claims status or prescriptions)

> _Supporting data: “Average time is 5 – 10 minutes. I can usually get what I need within that window. It could be longer if I have some trouble, which rarely happens.”_

> _Supporting data: “Using VA.gov is like going to the grocery store – I have a list of things I need and so I get them and get out.”_

## Additional Insights
_Any additional insights that aren't "key findings." These can be powerful comments from users that don’t represent a pattern in this study, but may be part of one outside this study._



# Recommendations

_Put together initial recommendations here based on your findings along with supporting evidence. Review with your team, then edit as needed._

* Recommendation 1 -Share findings with other teams that may be affected by the sign in process (specifically those affect by/concerned about  Vets not using VA.gov as a starting point)
    * _Supporting evidence_
* Recommendation 2- Use the sentiment around other providers and account creation process to build a case for Login.gov as a most secure provider
    * _Supporting evidence_



# Next Steps

_Next steps here. Include owners if appropriate._

Communication and marketing should be put in place for Login.gov
Participants stressed the importance of security and ease of use
Login.gov  should be the answer to those pain point 

# Further research needed

_If there are demographics that were not included in this study or you discovered that more research should be done, make note of that here._
