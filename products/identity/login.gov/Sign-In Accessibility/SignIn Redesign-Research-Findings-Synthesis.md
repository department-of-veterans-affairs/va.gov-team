# Research Goals

VA.gov will be making design changes to the sign-in page used by millions of Veterans. This study will ensure that familiar workflows, used by Veterans to access all digital services, are easy-to-follow and not impacted by design/copy changes, nor the addition of a new sign-in option.

Our goal is to understand how the addition of Login.gov and other design modifications to the VA.gov sign-in modal will impact a user’s ability to sign in.


# Research Questions

Sign-in Modal redesign

* What usability issues does the modified design pose to the current sign-in process?

* Are participants able to quickly locate their current sign in provider?

# Methodology 

Unmodderated Study

Sign-in Modal redesign

* This study was a Chalkmark first-click test in Optimal Workshop. Users weretasked with signing in to determine if they are able to locate their sign in provider give the design changes to the modal. At the end participants were provided a validation code (also in Optimal Workshop).

* 32 Veterans- geographically diverse (IL, MD, FL, NC, CA)
* 9 segment groups divided by CSP and how frequent users visit VA.gov.

# Hypotheses and Conclusions

_Hypothesis statement_

Sign-in Modal redesign
When presented with the changes to the VA.gov sign-in modal, participants will be able to select their desired credential provider.

* Likely True:
    * Participants were able to find and select their preferred credential provider. There were very few failed attempts. Although selections may not have aligned with the segment recruited


# Key Findings


1. 93.75% of Participants clicked on CSP buttons
    * 6.25% Failed to click on a CSP button
2. All credential providers were accounted for amongst participants
3. Participants sometimes selected providers that were not within their recruited segment group. 
    * (Marked as successful although different provider was selected)
4. Participants sometimes completed the study multiple times and used a different sign in provider from their previous attempt
5. When selecting their sign in provider most participants clicked on or near the provider logo. 
6. Participants that had failed attempts to find credential provider, did not attempt to retake study
7. It took participants a median time of 00:34 secs to complete the study. 




# Details of Findings 

_For each finding, list details with supporting quotes and images when possible. Please **add relevant keywords/labels to your findings** selected from the [research repository label list](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels?page=1&sort=name-asc). Adding keywords/labels to your findings will help others find research relevant to their work._

**All credential providers were accounted for amongst participants**

Regardless of their segment groups participants varied in credential providers. There was at least one click for every CSP button.
* 43.75% MHV
* 31.25% DS Logon
* 15.625% ID.ME
* 3.125% Login.gov


**Most Participants clicked on or around credential provider logos**

# Recommendations

_Put together initial recommendations here based on your findings along with supporting evidence. Review with your team, then edit as needed._

* Share findings with other teams that may be affected by the sign in process
* Look at solutions that simplify CSP buttons 
    * Suggesting the use of just the logos on the buttons
* Share ranking of attributes with comms and marketing- could be useful in guiding how VA communicates the changes to credential providers. 
Opportunity for UX research with users that we were not able to serve with this study




# Next Steps

* Design solutions should be reviewed by Collab Cycle in Staging review



# Further research needed

* Additional- Accessibility research study for new design
