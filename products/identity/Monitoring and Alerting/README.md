# Identity Monitoring and Alerting

## Summary
Monitoring and Alerting within the identity team encompasses our efforts to ensure continuous uptime of our services, ensure we are notified of any outages and issues, and provide useful metrics on information relating to Identity within the VA space.  The primary tools we use for this are Data Dog, Sentry, Loki, and Grafana.
