## POCs

### OCTO teams

This work involves the following teams:

- Identity
- CAIA
- Other VA.gov content/tool owners
- Design system team

## Overview
With the looming sunsetting of MHV and DSLogon it is incumbent that we use the Unified Sign-in Page to make the transition for Veterans who use those credentials as simply as possible.  Strategies for this include:

- De-emphazising the legacy credentials on the Unified Sign-in Page.
- Messaging to Veterans who use those credentials that they will need to transition to either Login.gov and/or ID.me prior to the sunsetting of the credential(s) they currently use.
- Explaining the processes for signing up for ID.me or Login.gov.


## User problem statements

- As a Veteran who currently uses MHV or DSlogon to sign-in to VA.gov, I would like to understand when using MHV & DSlogon logins will no longer be used so that I might switch to ID.me or Login.gov and continue to access my benefits.
- As a Veteran who currently uses MHV or DSlogon to login to VA.gov, I would like to understand how to use either ID.me or Login.gov in order to continue to access my benefits.

## User outcomes

### Desired User Outcomes
* Veterans understand the situation and switch en massse to either ID.me or Login.gov 



### Undesired User Outcomes
* Veterans do not switch over to either ID.me or Login.gov and cannot not access their benefits as usual.

## Business outcomes

### Desired Business Outcomes
* A smooth transition from four CSP to two CSP.
* Deadlines for MHV and DSLogon sunsets pass without incident.


### Undesired Business Outcomes
* Chaos and disorder at both the MHV and DSLogon deadlines.
* Call center swamped with outraged Vets who suddenly can't sign-in.



## Measuring success
* Call center calls (metric TBD)
* VSignals (metric TBD)


## Solution approach
* Comms to let Veterans know what is happening.
* UX changes to de-emphasize sunsetting credentials.
* Timeline which accelerates nudging Veterans to move away from MHV and DSLogon as their sunset dates approach.
