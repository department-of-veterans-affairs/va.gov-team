# My HealtheVet: Sign in Transition

Last updated: August 16, 2024

After **January 31, 2025**, Veterans will no longer have the option to sign in to VA web or mobile properties -- Including VA.gov and the VA: Health and Benefits mobile app -- with their **My HealtheVet** user ID and password.

The OCTO Identity Crew will facilitate and support this transition with a strategy that expands well beyond the VA.gov interface. It includes:

* Veteran-facing communication campaign
* Resources, education, and in-person support
* Internal change management
* Incremental UI and technology changes
