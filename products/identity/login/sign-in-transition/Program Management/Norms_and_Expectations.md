## General Practice
### Working remotely
Team members are expected to log in daily from a workspace with sufficient internet connection and limited background noise. Understanding that no space is perfect 100% of the time, you should do your best to attend meetings and stay in communication when you face connectivity or other disruptive issues. If you cannot attend meetings due to a disruption, you must communicate a backup plan in the #cedar-identity on MO’s Slack channel.
Time zones
Be mindful of teammates’ working hours and time zones. Most people tend to work between 8 AM - 5 PM in their respective time zones. There is no expectation that team members have to respond to messages outside of those hours unless it is a critical circumstance. 

When you schedule meetings async or create deadlines (i.e. EOD), clarify the hours and time zones.

### Meeting Etiquette
No agenda, no meeting. All meetings (except Daily Stand Up, Sprint Planning, and Backlog Refinement) should have a planned agenda shared in the calendar description. Please use our Team MO Meeting Notes doc to capture all team meeting notes. It is recommended that you attach this doc to all calendar invites.

All team members who are invited to meetings are expected to attend unless they mark themselves as unavailable in advance or are specified as optional. 

If you are the owner of a recurring meeting that you cannot attend, transfer ownership of the meeting to another attendee and have them accept the event and replace the meeting link with their own link.

When you create a meeting, add a Zoom or Google Meet link for internal meetings and a Teams link for meetings with external stakeholders. 

Try to attend meetings on camera as much as possible in front of external stakeholders. For internal meetings, you may attend cameras on or off but you will still be expected to remain engaged and participative in conversations.

It is recommended that team members in non-lead roles spend no more than 3-4 hours in meetings per day to ensure they have sufficient time to work on deliverables. Try to avoid scheduling meetings in the first or last 30 minutes of another teammate’s work day to ensure they have time to begin or end daily activities.

### Out of Office
#### Planned OOO
If you have an upcoming appointment and you will be AFK or OOO for part of the day, let the team know during Daily Stand-up and ASAP in the #cedar-identity-ooo channel on MO Slack.

**Part-day**
- Inform team at Daily Stand-up and in #cedar-identity-ooo Slack channel
**Extended** (1+ days):
- Notify team 2 weeks in advance or at Sprint Planning
- Mark calendar and share OOO plan in G Drive folder
- Post an OOO plan link in the #identity-mo-team channel Slack and tag teammates

#### Unplanned OOO
- Notify team ASAP in #cedar-identity-ooo Slack channel
- For sensitive issues, DM your lead

## Communications

Be as responsive and engaging as possible in all forms of communication. Check VA and internal Slack and email when you are not in meetings and respond to threads within a timely fashion during working hours. Defer to communicating in customer facing channels as much as possible, and tag team members when asking questions, sharing documents, providing async updates, and creating meeting back channels. For any other matters, you may use private channels such as direct messages or Slack huddles.For questions and topics that may not be ready to put in front of the customer, you may use internal channels (MO Slack). 

### Slack
**DSVA Slack**
- #identity-mo-team: this will be the primary channel for all team communications and engagement with the POs for project related matters
- #identity: Identity Crew channel - use to collaborate with other contractors in the identity space
- #secure-sign-in-transition: this is for larger initiatives (ones that can affect entire VA) related to MHV and DS Logon retirement
- #identity-support: this is for questions and requests

**MO Slack**
- #cedar-identity: this will be our primary channel for internal communication (use for internal strategy, sending OOO plans, and contract delivery updates)
- #cedar-identity-ooo: this is a channel where you may update the team on OOO or AFK times

### Email
**VA email**: sign into Citrix with your PIV and check everyday at least once a day. By checking your email on a daily basis, you will reduce the risk of losing access to your account due to inactivity (accounts are assumed to be inactive after a month of no sign-in).

**Company email**: primary communication takes place over Slack but check your email everyday at least once a day.

### Meeting Links
**Microsoft Teams**: use for setting up meetings that include external stakeholders. You may enter a meeting you do not own without a PIV. You may also host a Teams Meeting through your company email account, but make sure to add your VA email to the guest list.

**Zoom/Huddle**: use for setting up meetings for internal stakeholders only (or as a backup to Teams if needed)

### Standup
This is a 20-30 minute call to update the team on daily progress. Upon entering the zoom call, every teammate will raise their Zoom hand to indicate that they need to share their standup. Teammates should give an update on what they did the day prior, what they plan on doing the day of, and any blockers - all in relation to the tasks they own or support. The lead will choose one person to start and after each standup, each teammate will “popcorn” over to another teammate with their hand up. The leads in charge of each ticket (bess@digitalfoundry.com or Sofia Kirkman) will capture key callouts (e.g. blockers, priority changes) in Jira tickets. At the end of each standup, anyone may share a heads up for upcoming PTO, parking lot items, or teamwide updates. On Fridays, teammates share an async standup in a thread on the #identity-mo-team which opens at 8:30 AM PST.

### Sprint Planning
This is a one hour ceremony to ensure that the capacity and sprint goals are aligned and to estimate the effort through story pointing. All story pointing will follow the format outlined in our Task Management section. Story points are accumulative, inclusive of all stages (including peer review and/or testing) until completed (activity finished, peer reviewed, lead approved, tested and passed).

To properly prepare for the sprint planning ceremony all proposed stories for the sprint will be posted in the team DSVA slack channel #identity-mo-team ideally 24hrs prior to the session to allow for individual review and the opportunity to clarify any questions prior to story pointing. 

Activities include
Story refinement
Story ordering
Story pointing
Sprint capacity assessment

### Backlog Refinement
This one hour ceremony will start off by reviewing the status of current work and output planned for this sprint. At this time, team members may name any blockers, risks or adjustments to Sprint Demo. 

The rest of the hour is dedicated to identifying and describing needs and tasks for upcoming sprints. Subteams (design and data) may want to come up with a list of items ahead of time in their own weekly syncs to help team leads organize their tasks into stories. Team leads will create epics ahead of time according to the roadmap. They may create user stories and subtasks during Backlog to help meet the epics. Under each story, team leads should identify the target user group, the need, and the outcome. The leads will also write out Acceptance Criteria for a Definition of Done. 

### Team Retro
This is a 30 minute ceremony where our team can reflect on what went well, what didn’t go well and can be improved upon, and what action items can be taken into account for the next sprint. This meeting has a rotating facilitator (elected at the end of each meeting) and the facilitator may choose their own retro format. All retros will be documented in this Mural.

### Demos
We have biweekly 30 minute demos where we show our progress on project deliverables to our Product Owners. In Sprint Planning we identify the deliverables to include in the demo and the following Wednesday we combine a demo goal check-in with our daily standup to ensure deliverables are still on track to present. 

If teammates are blocked on a deliverable, they must make their leads aware ASAP in a meeting or public channel. This will help the team strategize and assess whether the progress can still be included in the demo deck. 

A demo deck template will be sent the Friday before a demo to ensure teammates have enough time to organize their deliverables in the slides and plan for the presentation. Presentations must be finalized no later than 11:59 PM PST the Tuesday before the demo. The team will have biweekly demo dry runs after standup on the Wednesdays that are demo days. All team members must stay through the dry run even if they are not presenting. At the end of day on Wednesday demo days, all team members must close their tickets so that a lead can take a screenshot of the tasks that were completed during the sprint. This screenshot is included in the Appendix of the demo deck before it is submitted to the COR for approval that we have satisfied our contractual requirements.

### Leads Sync
This is a 30 minute meeting dedicated to internal strategy alignment and plans for stakeholder engagement. Leads may ask questions to directors on how the project approaches fit into the roadmap and contract agreement.
1:1’s w/ Supervisors
All team members are expected to meet with their managers at least once biweekly for ~30 minutes. Managers are encouraged to keep separate docs for each team member they oversee. Team members may use this time to discuss personal career goals and their contributions with the ongoing or upcoming work.

**Jira standards**
Stories (for our project these will be separated into issues), also called “user stories,” are short requirements or requests written from the perspective of an end user. Stories should be items that can be completed within a sprint.
 Stories that require distinct steps or collaboration or that have an estimate of 5 or more days of work (5 story points) may be broken down into subtasks.
Reference for writing user stories
Epics are large bodies of work that can be broken down into a number of smaller tasks (called stories).
Use internal syncs and Backlog Refinement to create tickets for upcoming sprints (based on follow-up tasks, roadmap, or new directives from VA stakeholders)
Use Sprint Planning to pull tickets from the backlog into the upcoming sprint and refine stories and subtasks if needed. Leads will keep track of workload on each team member
Story points are estimates for the time of completion. Each point counts for one day of work. Make sure to account for waiting periods and time for revision.
Teammates may tag team members in the comments when they need to pair or need a reviewer
Issue owners are expected to update stories or subtasks with relevant information and statuses while working daily.
All stories that are done by the end of the sprint should be closed so that the leads may take a screenshot and put the the screenshot in the demo deck to submit to COR (by Thursday morning after end of sprint latest)
