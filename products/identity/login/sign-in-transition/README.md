# Sign in Transition: Initiative Overview

Last updated: December 3rd, 2024

## What is the Sign-in Transition?

VA is moving away from 2 legacy sign-in accounts and going all-in on 2 modern sign-in accounts by October 2025.

* After **January 31, 2025**, Veterans will no longer have the option to sign in to VA web or mobile properties -- Including VA.gov and the VA: Health and Benefits mobile app -- with their **My HealtheVet** user ID and password. Work related to this transition is stored in [MHV Transition](./mhv-transition/README.md).
* After **September 30, 2025**, Veterans will no longer have the option to sign in to VA web or mobile properties with their **DS Logon** username and password. Work related to this transition is stored in [DS Logon Transition](./ds-logon-transition/README.md).

## Secure Sign in Transition (SSiT) Team at a glance

### What we work on
Secure Sign in Transition (SSiT), formerly known as Login.gov Adoption (LGA) aims to streamline the sign-in process on VA.gov by offering Login.gov and ID.me as preferred credential options, while phasing out duplicative and non-compliant legacy credentials, expanding access channels, and enhancing pathways for Veterans to verify their identity in person.

### Project Workstreams
Our work has focused on 4 primary workstreams:

#### Workstream 1: In-person support
* Organize formal sign-up day events at VAMC & other locations across the country to provide on the ground support for Veterans and VA staff during the transition

  
#### Workstream 2: Inbox Management
* Monitoring a shared inbox channel where VA staff can request additional training, escalation pathways, & resources during this transition

  
#### Workstream 3: UX and Edge cases
* Helping to identify and explore edge cases that limit a Veterans ability to make the transition and explore user experience related improvements

  
#### Workstream 4: Data
* Collect and report out on data related to the transition to inform approach & monitor progress
