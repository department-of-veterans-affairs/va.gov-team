Last updated: August 16, 2024

## What is the Sign-in Transition?

VA is moving away from 2 legacy sign-in accounts and going all-in on 2 modern sign-in accounts by October 2025.

* After **January 31, 2025**, Veterans will no longer have the option to sign in to VA web or mobile properties -- Including VA.gov and the VA: Health and Benefits mobile app -- with their **My HealtheVet** user ID and password. Work related to this transition is stored in [MHV Transition](./mhv-transition/README.md).
* After **September 30, 2025**, Veterans will no longer have the option to sign in to VA web or mobile properties with their **DS Logon** username and password. Work related to this transition is stored in [DS Logon Transition](./ds-logon-transition/README.md).
