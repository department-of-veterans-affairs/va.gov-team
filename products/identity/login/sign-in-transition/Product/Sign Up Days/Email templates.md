Instructions
Send this email to volunteers who will have indicated their interest in facilitating a Sign Up Day in an area within range of an upcoming event.

Hello [VOLUNTEER NAME], 
Thank you for your interest in supporting OCTO’s Sign Up Day campaign to help transition Veterans to new log-in accounts. 
OCTO is hosting Sign Up Days to ensure all Veterans have access to support from VA staff during this transition. Sign Up Days are 1-2 day in-person events where VA staff help Veterans create a verified Login.gov and ID.me account. These events currently take place at various VA Medical Centers across the country. As the MHV and DS Logon sunset dates approach, they may expand to other VA affiliated sites. 
We have a Sign Up Day event scheduled on [DATE] in [Location] which is near you. We ask that you respond to this email to let us know if you can be available onsite to volunteer that day. 
We ensure Sign Up Day volunteers are well equipped before events by sending training materials and setting up a one hour training meeting a week in advance.
Please feel free to follow up with us with any questions you may have about Sign Up Days or this particular event.
We appreciate your willingness to volunteer and your dedication to supporting Veterans.
Kind regards,
[Name of MO teammate]

Subject: In-person events to help Veterans sign up for modern credentials

Hi [NAME],

I’m reaching out from VA’s Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO), where I’m the [JOB TITLE].
Together with my colleague, Jeannette Bruno, OCTO’s director of change management, I’m helping to
support the in-person sign-in transition efforts (also known as Sign Up Days) at facilities across the country. 

We are in the process of helping to transition Veterans to a new login solution. I am local to the [LOCATION] facilities and more than willing to come out and support the facility’s in-
person support events.

I wanted to ask if you have any upcoming events that you’re planning at these facilities? If yes, would
you like to jump on a call and see how I can help? If not, would it be helpful for me to work with each
MHVC to set a schedule where I can come out to facilities to support Veterans who need to make the
transition to new, modern credentials?

We’re happy to discuss more by email or set up a call.

Thank you,
[MO EMPLOYEE NAME]
