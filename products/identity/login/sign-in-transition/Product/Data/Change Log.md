| 1  | 2024-10-11     |The query the MHV team was using the generate the dataset for active MHV users was modified to remove the filter for users who had not logged in within 730 days. | The addition of a date based filter for login date was intended to remove users considered inactive for our reporting. It was determined that this was unneccssary due to the inclusion of the filter for deactivated users who meet this definition and the shared definition of active users may be a source of misalignment between MHV and the Domo SSiT dashboard numbers. | MHV    |
| 2  | 2024-11-12     |MHV removed the filter for username/password, resulting in the inclusion of users without these credentials in the 11/12 data drop | This filter change on MHV’s end has expanded our initial weekly and monthly reports to now encompass users without a username/password. We’re awaiting an updated dataset from MHV that will allow us to distinguish users by account status (Premium/Basic Matched) and filter data as needed to gain clearer insights. | MHV    |
| 3  | 2024-11-18     | Added two cards to Domo based on the comprehensive weekly data set, one for for users with Basic Match and one for users with MHV Premium. Users with no UID and password are filtered out. | Demonstrate split between users with MHV Basic Match and Premium credentials. Data also now includes users with no UID or password but they are being filtered out on both charts until we have more data from CDW to match against these users.      | John Marchi    |
| 4  | 2024-11-27     | Removed "not correlated" grouping for MHV Credential views and moved these users into "And neither Login.gov nor ID.me". | "Not correlated" was a misnomer and should have been something like "No user credentials in AuthDB".  This is an expected use case whereby users have only MHV credentials and no other credentials tracked by IAM. Also, AuthDB was recently updated to updated records which were missing ICNs for improved data quality.      | Steve Dickson    |
| 5 | 2024-12-03     | Updated the title and label of the "Users with MHV Credentials" section. Title updated to "Active MHV Users", updated card titles to reflect users with or without MHV credentials. | Users without MHV credentials have been added to the data set to further align with MHVs reported numbers.       | John Marchi    |
