# SSiT Inbox Expectations
Managed by Aiden Barr, Christine Julian, Jonathan Post, Sofia Kirkman, Tristan Jung, and Jeannette Bruno

## Goals of the inbox
<ul><li>Provide an escalation pathway for VA Staff to support Veteran identity issues with Login.gov or ID.me</li><li>Identify event requests and additional support opportunities</li><li>Gather sentiment about the transition</li></ul>


## Opportunities
<ul><li>Identify common themes and issues</li><li>Identify gaps in support materials to scale those further (improving VA self-service capability)</li><li>Identify additional edge cases not being met today by this pathway</li><li>Identify correlations in requests to other activities </li></ul>


## Steps for Management with Excel (Daily)
<ol><li>Log into VA and check for new emails and responses to older emails in the SIT inbox. Check this inbox at least once per day.</li><li>Sort emails into folders based on status. Put all the new mail in the "SIT: To do" folder, logging each new mail item in the Excel doc as you go, then respond to these as soon as possible (all mail should be responded to within 72 hours). You'll know mail is "fresh" if there's only a single message in the thread.</li><li>As you're responding to new mail, if you've sent a templated response, move the mail into the "SIT: In progress" folder. If an email needs extra help, use the "Fwd: OCTO SIT Leadership" Quick Step to loop in stakeholders and automatically sort the mail into the "SIT: Escalate" folder. Escalations will be for the POs to handle on a case-by-case basis (i.e. Sign up days).</li><li>Once you're done with new mail, review each thread with new responses to see if additional support or escalation is needed. If not, then move the mail to the "SIT: Complete" folder and log remaining info in Excel. The goal here is "inbox zero", emails should be fully sorted daily.
</li><li>Once you're done with mail for the day, log the total number of hours, in 15 minute increments, it took you to triage, respond, and log. For example, if you used 30 minutes you would log .5 hours in the Excel doc under the "hours" tab.</li><li>Keep track of issues ‘In progress’. If an issue has not had any activity for 3 business days, the issue will be moved to “SIT: Complete” folder.</li></ol>
