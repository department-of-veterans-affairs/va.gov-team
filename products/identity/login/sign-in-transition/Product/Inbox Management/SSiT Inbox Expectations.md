# Escalations

## Criteria for escalation
Issue has been troubleshooted and cannot be resolved by the sender or Veteran mentioned
Issue has not been identified nor resolved in the past and requires a new template response
Details about the issue might inform additional improvements or approach

*Reference [Escalation Process Maps](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1727895525955/cf8c28726436d27c0eac29b12b6a397ee2fa05e4?wid=0-1730123857497) for additional guidance.

## Escalation Template
**When forwarding escalations please also respond to the sender with the following message:**

Hello [name],

Thank you for bringing this to our attention. I have forwarded it to the [team] to escalate this further. They will let you know what is needed to resolve this issue. 

Sincerely,

[Name]

Secure Sign-In Transition Team | VA


**If external teams respond with additional updates forward on to the original sender of the issue for visibility. **
### Internal SIT Escalations
Forward email w/ request/need to SIT Product Owners CCing all three below…
Jeannette Bruno + Samara Strauss+ Tom Black

jeannette.bruno@va.gov

samara.strauss@va.gov

tom.black2@va.gov

### ID.me Escalations
Be sure we are submitting as much info to ID.me as possible so they can effectively locate the case on their end to get to a quick resolution.

Only share with Jess after gathering all the relevant information. Forward email with request/need to (the ID.me team will reach out to the Veteran directly to resolve open issues)

Jessica Guglielmini
jessica.guglielmini@id.me

#### ID.me support contact information
Help articles for common issues: ID.me's help center (https://help.id.me/) 
Help center support for VA only: 877-327-0022 (Monday-Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. ET). Select option 1 and follow the prompts. Note that wait times may vary. Please do not give this number out publicly. This number is only for VA staff and Veterans and giving the number out will cause longer wait times for Veterans.
Online support: 
Chabot (“Roy”): Go to ID.me's help center (https://help.id.me/). The chat bot will prompt you to engage.
Submit a support ticket: Go to Contact Support (id.me) (https://help.id.me/hc/en-us/p/contact_support). Select Submit a ticket to get started. (has to be done by the user directly, tickets cannot be opened on behalf of another individual)


### Login.gov Escalations
The Login.gov team typically does not follow up directly with the Veteran unless there was a call into their Help Desk to create a ticket or someone created a ticket for the Veteran.

If a ticket is not included when the issue is submitted to us we can submit one via the Login.gov contact page on behalf of the Veteran (using the info provided you in the inbox and from the Veterans email) and then letting the Login.gov team know in their weekly email share.

Forward email with the applicable ticket information and the request/need to all three contacts below.

## Troubleshooting
Tier 1: Non-technical support would involve utilizing the following generic response template the majority of the time or apply an appropriate templated response per their topic when applicable: 

Hello [name],

Thank you for bringing this to our attention. I have forwarded it to the [team] to escalate this further. They will let you know what is needed to resolve this issue. 

Sincerely,
[Name]
Secure Sign-In Transition Team | VA

Bonus: When time allows, we can do some quick reference to troubleshooting guides, share in slack channels public to CSPs to see if they are seeing issues related to the reported issue that came through.

If an issue does not include all needed information to access or escalate the issue, move the email to status “ In Progress” and respond with the following template:

Hello [Name],

Thank you for reaching out. We also need the following information [missing requirement], [missing requirement] + to be able to look into this issue further. Once received we can properly address the issue or escalate your request.

Sincerely,
[Name]
Secure Sign-In Transition Team | VA

Once sufficient information has been gathered, please send the escalation response and escalate appropriately. 

Refer to this document (SSiT Inbox Expectations) for response templates and Jeannette’s troubleshooting document on Sharepoint for providing responses based on experienced problems.
