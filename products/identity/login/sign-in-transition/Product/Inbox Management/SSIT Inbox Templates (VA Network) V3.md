### Court-Appointed Guardians (CAG)

\*Unique edge case the POs are bringing to OCTO/OIT/VHA leadership to
discuss how we might better serve this population.

Hello [name], 

  The VA is currently working on improved solutions for court-appointed guardians during this transition. In the meantime, please encourage only this specific audience (they must have legal authority on file with the VA as a court-appointed guardian or conservator) to keep using their MHV Premium account and reassure them that we will provide further direction as soon as a solution is in place. 

  We also want to ensure Veterans and their caregivers are aware that they will still continue to be able to manage their benefits in-person or by phone.  We will share your experience with our leadership and continue to provide updates as we have them. Thank you for sharing this information with us.

### Home Bound Primary Care (HBPC)

\*Unique edge case the POs are bringing to OCTO/OIT/VHA leadership to
discuss how we might better serve this population.

Hello [name], 

  The VA is currently working on improved solutions for home based primary care during this transition. Depending on what kinds of ID/documents they have, they may be able to do a trusted referee video call from home (assuming they have access to a smart phone or other device that can support a video call). People can use their Veteran Health ID card as their photo ID, should they have one. 

  We also want to ensure Veterans and their caregivers are aware that they will still continue to be able to manage their benefits in-person or by phone.  We will share your experience with our leadership and continue to provide updates as we have them. Thank you for sharing this information with us. 

Sincerely, 

[Name] 
Secure Sign-In Transition Team | VA 


If additional health or related CAG/POA information is shared about the Veteran as well you can use the following template. 

Hello [name], 

  Thank you so much for the additional support you are and continue to provide this Veteran and their caregiver. The VA is currently working on improved solutions for home bound primary care & those with court-appointed guardians or power of attorney during this transition. In the meantime, please encourage only this specific audience (they must have legal authority on file with the VA as a court-appointed guardian or conservator) to keep using their MHV Premium account and reassure them that we will provide further direction as soon as a solution is in place.

### Blind Veteran Access Issues 

MHV site has some known challenges with accessible navigation so there will not be a singular tool to resolve this issue. 

Possible routes: 

- Connecting Veteran to the BVA (blinded veterans association) or the VA 508 office asap for someone to help them out 
- Alistair in 508 office does amazing work 
- Forward this issue to Martha Wilkes on #accessibility-help as she is the accessibility liaison at the VA 

### No Valid ID

Some Veterans such as those in assisted living facilities or under power
of attorney POA/court-ordered guardian COG care may not have a valid
form of ID as accepted by Login.gov or ID.me  
Reference [[Troubleshooting
Guide](https://dvagov-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/personal/christine_julian_va_gov/Documents/SSIT/Sign%20Up%20Day%20Support/VA%20Resources/Secure%20sign-in%20guide%20for%20in-person%20events%20and%20support_v1_10.01.24%20(1).docx?d=wb6e5dcad9e194bf4844df7672a30cb52&csf=1&web=1&e=hcIcFo&nav=eyJoIjoiMTYwNjcxMjgxMiJ9)

Hello \[name\],

The VHIC can serve as a primary form of ID for **ID.me** only, and only
in certain circumstances.If the Veteran needs to use their VHIC as a
primary form of ID, they must go through the video call flow. They
cannot select the self-service option.

- If the Veteran plans to use the VHIC for a primary form of ID, they
  need 2 additional forms of secondary ID documentation. These include
  things like:

  - Their Social Security Card

  - A utility bill with their full name and current address

  - An SSA-1099 form with their full name and address

  - A non SSA-1099 form with their full name and address

  - A vehicle registration/title with their first and last name and the
    name of the issuing organization (DMV). This document must include
    the words "Registration" or "Title."

  - An auto insurance card with their first and last name, auto
    insurance provider name, valid expiration date, and at least 4
    digits of their identification, account, card, policy or customer
    number

  - An auto or home insurance statement with their first and last name,
    insurance provider name, at least the last 4digits of their
    identification, account, card, policy, or customer number, and a
    valid expiration date (if included).

### Verification Loops

VA staff may share experiences with various verification loops in which
they are having to repeat themselves under lengthy processes with the
verification providers. Please escalate this to the appropriate party as
deemed necessary and respond with the statement below.

Hello \[name\],

While setting up a new account and verifying for the first time,
Veterans do need to log in a few times throughout the process. Our
technical teams are working to improve the sign in experience for
Veterans and we have flagged this for the teams.

### Refusal to Share SSN (Social Security Number)

Reference the [Troubleshooting
Doc](https://dvagov-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/personal/christine_julian_va_gov/Documents/SSIT/Sign%20Up%20Day%20Support/VA%20Resources/Secure%20sign-in%20guide%20for%20in-person%20events%20and%20support_v1_10.01.24%20(1).docx?d=wb6e5dcad9e194bf4844df7672a30cb52&csf=1&web=1&e=oZPZ9c&nav=eyJoIjoiMTY4NDQ2NjMyNiJ9)

Hello \[name\],

Thank you for sharing this feedback. Social security numbers are
required for both ID.me and Login.gov to complete identity verification.
If it is helpful, Login.gov is the government's provider for this
service so we do encourage folks to try this account verification option
if they are concerned with sharing their SSN with a private company.
Additionally, Veterans always have the option to manage healthcare and
benefits over the phone or in person.

Sincerely,

\[Name\]

Secure Sign-In Transition Team \| VA

### No Access to Smartphone

Hello \[name\],

Veterans can also set up a new account with a flip phone to receive
their multi-factor authentication (MFA) code. They do need a device or
way to access their email for the account creation process.

Sincerely,

Secure Sign-In Transition Team \| VA

### No Access to a Camera  {#no-access-to-a-camera}

Hello \[name\],

In the event the Veteran does not have access to a camera on their
computer or phone to upload their ID documents they will need to utilize
Login.gov and select the post office option to allow them to verify via
in-person proofing.

Once the Veteran creates their account on VA.gov they will log in by
clicking the link to the VA's unified sign in page (screenshots below).
Select the "[[Verify your identity at a post
office]{.underline}](https://www.va.gov/resources/how-to-verify-your-identity-for-your-logingov-account/)"
option. They will enter the information (no photo uploads required) and
will receive a barcode to take to a participating post office, who can
complete verification for them. You can search for a post office for the
Veteran
[[here]](https://login.gov/help/verify-your-identity/verify-your-identity-in-person/find-a-participating-post-office/#:~:text=A%20.gov%20website%20belongs%20to%20an%20official%20government).

Hello \[name\],

If the Veteran doesn't have an email address, they'll need to create an
email address before trying to create an account. They'll also need to
be able to access that email address on their mobile phone, tablet, or
another device.

If the Veteran has a smartphone, tablet, or laptop with them, guide them
on how to create a free email address with the provider of their choice
(such as a Gmail or Yahoo account). If they have an email address but
don't remember the password, guide them on how to reset the password.
They'll need to take these actions on their own device because VA
devices on VPN won't allow access to private emails.

If the Veteran doesn't have a device to create an email address, fill
out a **follow-up information sheet** for them (refer to link included
below). Offer continued support by phone or future appointment.

### Veteran w/ Dementia

Hello \[name\],

Thank you for looping us in on this issue. The VA is currently working
on improved solutions for these types of scenarios during this
transition. In the meantime, please encourage **only** this specific
audience (they must have legal authority on file with the VA as a
court-appointed guardian or conservator) to keep using their MHV Premium
account and reassure them that we will provide further direction as soon
as a solution is in place.

We will continue to provide updates as we have them.

Hello \[name\],

If the Veteran has a driver's license or other state ID, they may still
be able to get an identity-verified account through **Login.gov** or
**ID.me**. Use the address that's on their license when entering
information. They can change their address with the account provider
later by going to the **Login.gov** or **ID.me** website and updating
their address in their profile.

If the Veteran has a driver's license or other state ID, but doesn't
have a phone on a plan in their own name, they may be able to verify
their identity for **ID.me** on a video call. But they'll need other
forms of ID to upload before they can start the video call. For example,
they'll need ID documents such as Social Security card, medical bill,
birth certificate, or DD214. If they don't have the right documents, you
can help them try to get the documents they need. Refer to the **If a
Veteran doesn't have the right ID** section for more information.

If the Veteran doesn't have a driver's license or other state ID (or the
ID is expired), they may be able to verify their identity for **ID.me**
on a video call. But they need other ID, such as a Social Security card,
medical bill, birth certificate, or DD214. They may also need a document
called a **Letter Attesting State Residency (LASR)**. This is a sworn
statement that proves the Veteran's address if they don't currently have
a permanent address.

f the Veteran needs a LASR, this document must meet the following
criteria:

- It has the Veteran's first and last name, institution or agency name,
  and staff name or signature.

- It's on official letterhead from a shelter, drug treatment facility,
  halfway house, shelter for abused women, nonprofit entity, employer,
  faith-based organization, or government entity within the U.S.

- It can be scanned in full-color or black and white, a photocopy, or
  PDF file.

<!-- -->

- You can help the Veteran get a Letter Attesting State Residency.
  Contact the closest VA Community Resource and Referral Center or the
  social work office for the VA facility where the Veteran gets care.
  Ask the staff to write and sign a letter on VA letterhead confirming
  that the Veteran is in VA's homelessness program for the state.

Hello All,

We got this from a \[role\] - I am working with our product owners
Jeannette, Samara, and Tom to see what might have prompted the
re-verification on the VA side but I wanted to see if there was anything
you'd be able to share with us about this Veteran's account so I can
communicate back to the \[role\]? It seems like \[summary of issue\]. I
have also \[summary of actions taken such as gathering additional

### Failed Phone Verification

Hello \[name\],

If this Veteran was not able to verify their phone with
[[Login.gov]](http://login.gov/) they need to verify by mail
by following the instructions on the flow. Here's what it looks
like:![](media/image4.png){width="3.7269422572178477in"
height="4.286458880139983in"}

Has this Veteran tried ID.me? If not I would see if you can support them
in setting up an ID.me account.

### Can't Verify ID Via Upload  {#cant-verify-id-via-upload}

Hello \[name\],

The team recommends trying the in-person verification process. They
would restart the verification with Login.gov and select the in-person
option which does not require an ID upload.

### Barcode on ID Error

Hello \[name\],

I'm sorry that you are experiencing these issues. We found that it helps
to take photographs of the ID front and back PRIOR to starting the
verification process so that you can upload them during the flow. We
generally have more success with this path.

We also have recommended the following tips when taking photos of IDs

- Make sure the Veteran's ID---especially the barcode---is clean and
  undamaged.

- Prop the Veteran's ID up against a solid, dark background. Avoid white
  or textured backgrounds.

- Turn off the camera's flash and live photos functions.

- Make sure the area is well lit with indirect light. View the ID
  through the phone's camera and make sure there are no glares or
  shadows. Adjust the ID placement and light until you get a clear, full
  image of the ID.

- Hold the phone as still as you can with both hands, with your elbows
  at your sides, and your legs or hips braced against a door or wall. Or
  prop the phone on a steady base, like a table, wall, or the ground.

- Make sure your camera view includes the entire ID and no part is cut
  off.

- Try to hold your breath for the moment when you take the photo.

### Re-Verification Request[ Hello \[name\],]

[  
Thank you for reporting this issue. We have escalated to ID.me for
guidance on Veteran \[name\] account and will let you know what we hear
back.]{.mark}

Sincerely,

Secure Sign-In Transition Team \| VA  
  
**Escalation to ID.me**: forward received email to
[[jessica.guglielmini@id.me]](mailto:jessica.guglielmini@id.me)

Hello Jessica,

Can you look into this Veteran and see why they're having to reverify
with ID.me after previously setting up their VA account?

### Invalid Birth Certificate

Hello \[name\],  
  
Thank you for reaching out. The VHIC is considered a form of primary ID,
and then the Veteran will need 1-2 other forms of secondary ID to
complete this process. Since the birth certificate has issues, does this
Veteran have a Social Security card with his name and number? That can
be used along with a bank statement with name/address.  
  
Does this Veteran have a DD214 on file with VBA? If so, that can also be
used as a secondary form of ID.

The Veteran will need to get his full name corrected on his birth
certificate. Once they have the updated birth certificate they can use
that for State ID and can also use that for ID.me verification if they
don\'t have their Social Security Card.

I hope this information is helpful,  
  
Sincerely,

If unresolveable, escalate to ID.me for additional support

**Response:**

Thanks \[name\]. Let me escalate this to ID.me for additional support.
In the meantime, as long as the Veteran has the VHIC and their DD214
they should be able to use both of those plus something like a utility
bill to get support but I'll have ID.me reach out to the Veteran
directly.

### Sees Spouses Info After Logging In

Requires escalation to ID.me

ID.me to escalate this further. We will let you know what is needed to
resolve this issue.

### Name Mismatch

\*If the VA staff has not mentioned or included an ID.me help desk
ticket

Hello \[name\],

Thank you for bringing this to our attention. Have you contacted the
ID.me help desk for support? ID.me may be able to verify this Veteran
over a video call. Do you happen to know if the Veteran's full name is
on their social security card? If so then ID.me should definitely be
able to support.

Sincerely,  
\[Name\]  
Secure Sign-In Transition Team \| VA

### Address Mismatch on ID

Hello \[name\],

Did the Veteran try to go through the Trusted Referee process with
ID.me? As long as the Veteran has a utility bill or another piece of
documentation with their full name and new address, as well as their
license and a document like their social security card they can
successfully get verified through the ID.me video process.

### Issue with Photo Upload

Hello \[name\],

For Veterans who are having issues with photos, we recommend using
[[Login.gov]](http://login.gov/) and getting to a local
participating post office for in person proofing.

Once the Veteran creates their
[[Login.gov]](http://login.gov/) account, they will log in
by clicking the link to the VA's unified sign in page (screenshots
below). Select the "[[Verify your identity at a post
office]](https://www.va.gov/resources/how-to-verify-your-identity-for-your-logingov-account/)"
option. They will enter the information (no photo uploads required) and
will receive a barcode to take to a participating post office, who can
complete verification for them. You can search for a post office for the
Veteran
[[here]](https://login.gov/help/verify-your-identity/verify-your-identity-in-person/find-a-participating-post-office/#:~:text=A%20.gov%20website%20belongs%20to%20an%20official%20government).

### Cloudfare Authentication Failure

Hello \[name\],

ID.me has made changes to the verification flow to proactively prevent a
security concern due to an identified potential issue**.** ID.me quickly
implemented a new screen in the verification flow to "verify you are a
human" to proactively protect Veterans and others due to an identified
potential issue. ID.me's engineering teams are working on a more
long-term solution and will be making improvements to this experience as
soon as they verify that the issue is resolved.

It may be difficult to pinpoint the cause of failure for this Veteran.
If they haven't already the Veteran can open a helpdesk ticket with
ID.me or attempt again at another time.

## Local Staffing Concerns

Hello \[name\],

We are happy to partner with you and create an event in your area to
support the sign-in transition. However, a single event will not address
local staffing concerns, as Veterans need to be supported on a daily
basis between now and January. Is there anything that DHO/OCC/VHA
Communications can do with respect to garnering additional support for
this facility?

Hello \[name\],

Thank you for reaching out to confirm your event. This event has been
