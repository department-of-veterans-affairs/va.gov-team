This is to start tracking tasks relating to Sign-On and Identity Management

The high-level plan:


Improve Sign In Experience for Vets.gov


Design & test easier to use sign-in flow #3800
Brand sign-in flow pages to Vets.gov #3801

Make it Easy for Existing Veterans Credentials to Work on Vets.gov #3806


As a logged in MHV user, I can access services on Vets.gov without logging in again
As a logged in DS_Logon user, I can access services on Vets.gov without logging in again (especially Healthcare application from Disability Benefit Application on eBenefits)
As a non-logged in user with a MHV credential, I can log into VA.gov using my MHV credential
As a non-logged in user with a DS_Logon credential, I can log into VA.gov using my DS_Logon credential

Make it Easy for Vets.gov Credentials to Work on VA Functionality #3807


Logged in VA.gov user clicks into another VA service, and does not need to log in again. Specifically, they click "schedule an appointment" and can access the VAR as a logged in user.
As a non-logged in user with an ID.me-powered credential, I can login to access VA services not on Vets.gov with my ID.me password/username/2FA
Also, a logged in DS_Login user on eBenefits can click "Apply for health care" and can come to VA.gov we can recognize them as a logged in user and prepoulate fields etc.
Share Vets.gov credentials with IAM so....SSOe + ID.me (waiting on Angela?)

Grandfather LOA2 users as LOA3 users #3809


Get NIST approval for letting LOA2 users access Vets.gov functionality at LOA3 #3963
Define list of functionality that should be LOA2 vs. LOA3 on VA.gov (done)
