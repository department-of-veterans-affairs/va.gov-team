### Definitions
Credential Service Provider: service that holds your credentials  (eg, username, password, multi-factor information) for an authentication. Often used to show "I am the person who created this account."

Identity Proofing: A process to determine that the user is who they say they are in real life. This is distinct from whether or not they created and can access a related account from a CSP.

LOA: a specification for how reliable the "attribute" information (eg, full name, ssn, address) provided by an identity provider is. Higher levels of LOA are achieved by stricter Identity Proofing requirements.

Veteran Verification: A process to determine whether the user is a veteran.

Database: Where information about a user is stored.

Profile: The definition of what needs to be stored in the Database of users. i.e. The profile includes name, address, birthdate, etc.
