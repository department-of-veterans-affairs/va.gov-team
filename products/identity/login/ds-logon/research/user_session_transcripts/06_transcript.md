*[moderator reads opening script]*

**M: Alright, we are recording. So I’d like to confirm — are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**

P: Yes.

**M: Perfect. So let’s dive in with a few warm-up questions. What VA websites or applications do you access online?**

P: Um, my husband [inaudible] eBenefits.

**M: Okay. And how do you login to each of those?**

P: Um, I go to MyHealtheVet and login from there. Uh and then...with eBenefits, um, I just go to eBenefits.VA.gov, whatever the website is. I have it saved. I go in from there. Do you mean like do I have a DoD login? Do I...you know...all that intricate stuff they always ask?

**M: Yeah, which of those do you tend to use for each of those websites?**

P: Um, can I...let me try looking while we’re talking. I don’t...I don’t want to...if you don’t hear me for a second, then I need to not try to do that at the same time.

P: Let’s…

**M: If it’s something you’re comfortable with, you could screenshare and we could walk along with you as you, as you kind of figure out how to login to all those sites.**

P: Okay...and I know that they also have just done some updating too. So, uh, MyHealtheVet, I go to login. And...let’s see. MyHealtheVet user ID, that’s what I use.

**M: Great. Would you be comfortable screen sharing as we, as we talk through this?**

P: Um, sure. Let me go back to it.

**M: Yeah, so in the Zoom application, there’s a bar at the bottom of the screen with a green button that says “share.”**

P: Right. Okay. So...let me go to...ooh. Where that is…[inaudible] basic maybe? Screen share. Here we go. Okay. Now let me go back to that. Okay. Can you see MyHealtheVet?

**M: Yeah, we can. Thank you.**

P: So what I did for our family’s circumstances. My husband’s off for significant brain injury. So I obtained a login for him, so I can get all his healthcare and deal with it all once. Because I don’t need to explain to you how tedious that is.

**M: Yeah, I can imagine.**

P: He can’t, he can’t visually track uh, websites and things like that with his brain injury. But it’s really handy being able to do the secured messaging. Like that is something that...it’s not as much of a time saver as it is in the civilian world. Using you know, intraoffice email between all the practitioners there. But you can see here, since December 2016, I was trying to help him get an adaptive grant. Gave up. Prosthetics consults, finally got that done. But um, yeah. So that’s I get in MyHealtheVet. I don’t know if you have more questions about that but basically because he was getting so much care initially, um, when he got discharged from the Army due to the severity of his injury [inaudible]...login from going to the hospital there, in [location].

**M: Right, yeah. And I—**

P: Go ahead.

*[3:52]* **M: So I noticed when you brought this screen up, you had already been logged in. So I’m wondering if you could log out, and then walk us through ,you know, what choices you make and how you login.**

P: Sure. Yeah, I have a saved ID and password and...Um, I don’t feel like people hack me to get in here. There’s no financial gain at all. Sorry. Trying to keep my sarcasm out of it.

**M: No worries. You can feel free to express any opinions you have.**

P: So, see. I don’t deal with any of this nonsense over here [gesturing towards the sign-in partner options on MyHealtheVet].

**M: Yeah, tell me a bit about that.**

P: Well, cause I already have this saved and I’m lazy. And I have like 9 million other things to do as a caregiver besides worry about if the DS Login, cause you have to have like 9 million letters, paragraphs, person’s kidney in your life, like to get in. I just don’t. I just...this has worked so far, so...that’s what I do. I’m waiting till they tell me “you gotta change your password again” cause...think about how many vendors you deal with on a daily basis. And then add, you know, I don’t know, at least 20 more digits to a username and password. It’s just, it’s just a lot. So I don’t bother with it. And you can see, we have a premium login which means we had to have that paperwork signed at the hospital.

**M: Gotcha. And what is, what was that process for getting a premium login?**

P: Well, it was, you know...once I saw the little prompt saying, “Hey, you can just login using a user and password” if you’ve been verified...you I don’t know, verified as an A-lister? Frequent flier at the VA hospital? I don’t know what it really stood for, um. But they just said, “Hey when you’re at the hospital, bring this. Print this out and someone will do something administratively and get you connected.” So that’s what I did. I mean, I already do have an ID and me setup, just so I can get discounts when I buy [name] stuff, but I haven’t bothered trying to login using that.

**M: And why is it that you haven’t bothered trying to login with that ID.me?**

P: Cause I already have this user and password saved. It’s done.

**M: Gotcha.**

P: And in the caregiver world, something that’s done is more precious than gold.

**M: Yeah, that makes sense.**

P: I mean, think about it. Like, I spend my day driving him to all his appointments. By the time I get home, everything that hasn’t been done around the house logistically, let alone paperwork, um...you name it. It’s gotta be done. And why do I wanna mess with trying a bunch of different login passwords only to have frustration, which [laughs] there’s already a lot of frustration in my day.

**M: Mhm.**

P: As soon as I hit the road, no one’s a good driver.

**M: Yeah.**

P: Sorry that’s the New Yorker road rage in me coming out. Yeah and that’s, I live in the [state, city], this area. Well, a suburb. I don’t know where you guys are all located. Where are you guys all located?

**M: We are all over the country, but uh, I live in out in Seattle and our favorite pastime is to whine about traffic, so.**

P: Well, you got a bunch of stoners out on the road out there, just like we do in this area. So, yeah. No one’s driving fast enough. They get on the tollway where it should be 85 and they pull a 60. It’s enough to give you an aneurysm. So you can see why I’m lazy and I just stick with the user password that’s saved on my computer.

**M: No, that makes sense to me. It sounds like prioritizing time and things that are complete and you know, reducing the amount of stress. Which makes sense to me.**

P: Exactly. I’m all about self-preservation of energy and time. And you know, I waste money using the tollway even though it’s not like I have a corporate life anymore and don’t have a boss over my shoulder, micromanaging my time. So I could take the free roads. But yet, I probably truly would suffer an aneurysm and then our ship would sink. So um, out of health preservation and sanity, I use the tollway. Even though it costs money [laughs].

**M: That makes sense. You mentioned that you also will sign into eBenefits and I’m wondering if we could go to that website and you could walk us through…**

P: Okay. I haven’t been on that in a little bit, so it’ll be surprising to me if I can get in. Just cause I know they have been changing it. Oh, crap. Uh.

**M: What is it that you’re seeing here?**

P: Oh it’s...I’ve got to pull up the 25 digit user password BS combo this requires you to have. Let’s see, I gotta click on something here. Okay, agree. Well let’s see if this works. Nope. Okay. Give me a minute cause I gotta pull up this stupid password combo. Hang on a second. See, this is the frustrating stuff. Uh, let’s see. eBenefits...Sorry guys, I have like a whole vault of passwords that I keep. Cause, I used to be able to track them all and I can’t.

**M: Yeah, where is— where do you keep that vault? Is that, you know…**

*[10:00]* P: Um, on my phone. Sorry, I’m not sharing it with you guys. It’s on my phone.

**M: No worries. Totally understand.**

P: If you know my passwords, I have to kill you. Sorry. I’m really just joking. But um…

**M: No no, totally understand.**

P: Like um, I use OneNote. And that way it’s on my phone, it’s on my computer. It’s everywhere I need. Okay. Just trying to find it. I wish it had a smarter search engine on this thing, that’s all. Sorry, I have a lot of vendors and passwords to scroll down through. I should probably do a separate section for VA crap. I mean, stuff. Sorry. Okay, come on...where are you? Here you are. There’s...alright. Let’s see if this works. And it has been awhile so it’ll probably prompt me to change it.

**M: How frequently does it prompt you to change your password?**

P: I don’t remember. It just seals every time I want to use it.

**M: Yeah, how often do you find yourself needing to login to eBenefits or MyHealtheVet?**

P: Um, it just depends on the...can you see it? Ugh, look at this crap. Okay, now I’ve got to change the password. Let’s see...let me try my other password. Sometimes I will change it and I will save it but it will revert back to the old one so let me try...another one here. And I’m sorry, I can’t remember the intervals in which they ask me to change it. I just...it’s not important for me to remember.

**M: Totally understand.**

P: It’s just more of a frustration level thing. Alright. Let me try...I’ve got one more shot and then I’m gonna have to do the forgot password yahoo crap and it’s going to take us a few minutes. I apologize.

**M: No this is actually—.**

P: As I’ve explained, the hierarchy of need of caregivers. Of...simple steps, like. Can you imagine being a TBI guy? Like a veteran with TBI that hasn’t slept all night long, cause he has severe PTSD and other physical pain, so he can’t sleep. And then he gets some snarky person on the phone from the VA telling him he’s gotta log on to his eBenefits and do it all that way. But he can’t visually track. Which is not unique to my husband...just gonna tell you that. And a single Veteran that doesn’t have a spouse or an advocate to help him? He would probably break his PC. See...here we go! Let’s see which one is the magic ticket. I get the need for security, trust me, right? I used to work in the tech world selling secure software like cloud, um...barracuda, you know, virus intrusion stuff to corporations. I get the need; I really do. But there’s got to be an easier way. Alright, now I’ve got to jot this down...what this password says. Uh, let’s see. Can’t change for 24 hours, must contain these special characters, 9 characters...1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9. Okay. I think I got it. Let’s see if it takes it. Submit. Nope. Let’s see...more than 3 letters. Okay. So I’ll just change this. Sorry guys. VA sarcasm here.

*[15:22]* **M: No worries. We destroy these tapes after, so.**

P: This makes it easier to remember for when I write them down. There’s only so many ways you can write asshat with letters and numbers [laughs]. Incorrect password? Oh, now I’ve got to type it in again. So if I was a guy with a brain injury right now, all by myself, trying to get on to access his benefits...I would’ve given up.

**M: So you usually have to type it again as a…**

P: It timed out.

**M: Ah, I see.**

P: And a guy...I’m pretty capable, mentally. I’d say...I’m batting higher than average, there, on the IQ scale. Not genius, but you know, no mouth breather. And this...the timing...you know, cause you got to look down at what you write. You gotta figure out the password. Write it down, so after this thing enters in, you don’t forget what you created. Casue then you gotta go through this all over again. And uh…”current password you provided does not match”? What? Okay, that’s what I used to get in to this bloody thing. Alright, let me try the other one. But if this is supposed to be user-oriented towards to the Veteran...many generations of Veterans are not as computer literate. And also are not as able with their fingers, like fine motor skills. Ah! Time for champagne. Alright, why am I getting this crap? Just log me in. Now that you’ve gone through all this wonderful stuff, you have to click there. Which I have to scroll down to. Let’s see if it’s picked, saved the right one. Well this is good, because I need to print of a letter of his disability for our property taxes. Okay, let’s see if that works. Ha. Well ladies...gentleman, if there’s a gentleman back there being mute. Let’s go to letter generator. This is something most people have to do at least once a year for their property tax. They say they save it for 3 years but Williamson County in Texas is not able to save something apparently, for 3 years.

**M: So you find that you’re logging in at least once a year for eBenefits? Is that correct?**

P: Um, yeah. The past four I’ve logged in more than that, cause our son was going to college on the G.I. Bill. Let’s see...proof of...benefits summary...benefit verification, let’s see if that’s it. But he’s done with college. Okay, that says...I don’t want to take that to the property tax people.

**M: Now [name], do you remember what the process of setting up the DS logon or the DoD account um, when you first set it up. Do you remember what that was like?**

P: Oh girl, that was many, many, many moons ago. Proof of minimum essential coverage...let’s see if that’s it. Yeah, that’s not the letter I’m looking for. I don’t want people knowing his salary. That’s not cool. Um...disabled preference, no. Can’t get a job. Service verification...nope. That is not the droids I’m looking for. Alright. Where the—hmm. Well. [searches for “disability percentage letter proving disability”]. Sorry guys. Now I’m down a rabbit hole.

*[20:51]* **M: Do you find that the process of, you know, getting into eBenefits and looking for what you need tends to end in these rabbit holes?**

P: [laughs] You know, a lot of times I’ll use Google. You know, what form do I need to apply for, uh, the clothing allowance, you know, from prosthetics. And boom, the form number will pop up and I’ll go on here under forms and make sure I’ve got the current form. Because if you don’t have the right form, then...let’s see. How do I get back? I don’t want to click back cause it’ll probably log me out. Status tracking, documents, and records. Here we go. Uh? Summary, service member, civilian employment. VA record sharing, medical records, myPay, VA letters. Service letter verification, let’s see if I can find that. I should already be logged in. See this?

**M: What is it that you—**

P: Can you see the screen?

**M: Mhm. Yeah.**

P: Okay, so I went and I scrolled and it says...now it’s making it look like I’ve got to log in again. See? This service is available to our account holders with Premium Access.

**M: So I noticed that you had premium access on your MyHealtheVet account. Is that something that you have on your..**

P: I thought so? Ish? So...let’s see what happens here, cause obviously I’m not going to be able to get what I need. That’s great. So I believe it’s the same user and password that I logged in with. So yeah, this letters something. Every Veteran has to provide to the property tax office. Okay, here we go. Disability compensation…supporting document for claims...VA letters...compensation claim status? Uh. I do need to get some hearing aid batteries. Focus, [name], on that stupid letter. Uh. Let’s just see what this does, just for the hell of it. Sorry, I’m just making sure they’ve got our son off of here. You just can’t click, like, I wanted to go to manage dependents. Children, okay good. Not on award. Perfect. That is how it should be. Okay. Just cause I don’t want them to pay us for him being on there. Cause he graduated from college and he’s not in [inaudible] anymore. Okay, so that’s done. But you can see where it won’t let me get out of there. Like it won’t let me backtrack. So let’s see if I can just go back. Oh, I can’t believe it didn’t log me out. Okay, let’s go back to dashboard.

**M: Is that kind of typical in your experience, that if you click the back button, you get logged out?**

*[24:40]* P: Sometimes. Not, mmm, not all the time, um...I just. Okay. Edit profile. It’s gotta be under here. That’s where it used to be, to get that stupid letter. Confirm your address on file, yeah that’s confirmed. ‘Kay...benefits. Verification. I think that’s the same thing I clicked on last time. [sigh] Yeah, that doesn’t say that he’s 100% disabled; that’s what I need. And you can see you couldn’t click back there. There wasn’t any choice. Let’s see if the benefit summary. Ah! Over clicked. Okay, there’s the 100%. Ahhh, okay let’s see if that’ll work. Okay! This is it. So I’m going to have to black that out. It’s stupid, they need to generate this without the financial thing because a guy with brain injury would see this and go “this is not what I need” He would say “I need,” because this is a different format than the letters used to look like. You know, someone with a non-brain injury can look at this and go “k, this will work. This says specifically on here, you know, use for local property or vehicle tax.” So that will work. But a guy with brain injury would see that and go “that’s a 2 page thing, that’s really not what I’m looking for.” And it would also have his money on there, which no guy in his right mind would want to submit what he’s earning to any sort of government entity. That’s what this, you saw, those were my only options to create this. So, cool. So I accomplished that. But now I’ve got to black it out, scan it, you know, there’s more steps that shouldn’t be needed to do.

**M: Right.**

P: I wish I could take a screenshot of the old form just so you guys could see the difference. Is this something that you can give them feedback on?

**M: It’s certainly information we can pass on. It’s not the focus, per se, of this research. But—**

P: Gotcha. You guys are mostly interested in how people get in and use the site?

**M: Yeah, but anything that comes up we will certainly make notes and pass on.**

P: Cause that would’ve been my husband’s undoing. And he’s a smart guy. He used to be a chemist before he got his brain injury.

**M: Gotcha. And besides, you know, instances where you have to reset your password or you have trouble, you know, logging in. Are there other times when you are trying to access eBenefits and you aren’t able to get in?**

P: I mean, very once in a blue moon, I will go to access it and they’re doing updates. But I know that there’s a huge push for, you know, infrastructure change. You know, software-wise, internet-wise. You know, supposedly a kinder, softer side of the VA is being created to be less paper-ful. And uh...it’s just taking a while. I’m just clicking on this just to see what this does. See now here, you have to have a VGLI account. But we don’t have VGLI coverage. But this, I think should be seamless.

**M: And say more when you say seamless. What does that mean to you?**

P: Like same username and password. Even though I understand VGLI, you know, this is through a different company. So therefore their own encryption, their own demands. But there’s got to be a way to do it a little different, to make it easier. Or maybe explain in bigger print because you know some of the users are 60 years old. Saying “hey, um, this is actually you know, a different vendor than you know, the government. You need to create your own unique username and password to this vendor program.” Just...I mean...it says this [points to a section that reads “Create an Account to pay your premium…”] but some of this stuff, even though it seems basic and self-explanatory to us, is not that way for a 19-year-old kid that just returned home from getting blown up and has never dealt with anything in the insurance world, benefits-wise, HR. You know, all the stuff you dealt with in the army was a blur, and now he’s home and he’s, you know, having to build his life back from scratch. Which...uh, I know a lot of people like that unfortunately. And this would be beyond frustrating to them. I can’t tell you how many guys we saw at Ft. Sam Houston when my husband got injured. And we were on the older side of it. My husband went in at age [age] after 9/11. He wasn’t 19 but the amount of kids we saw...I just think this should be a little more explanatory because okay, and a lot of them are on meds, because they’re injured and they’re having to recover from really painful surgeries. So that kind of messes with your visual tracking a little bit. If you do have a brain injury at all, I’m just thinking from the level of physical discomfort and other things that would provide a distraction from someone being able to use this seamlessly.

*[31:15]* **M: Yeah, definitely. Have you ever, um, you know, worked with a VCO or you know, like a VA representative to kind of navigate these sites?**

P: Nope. This is the first time I’ve ever talked to you guys.

**M: Well we certainly appreciate you, you know, sharing your insights and walking us through this process. We can, we can definitely see where there are instances where this is a really frustrating process and that, you know, serves as a barrier to accessing the things that you should be able to access.**

P: Yeah, like a guy, a guy in crisis. You know, I’m sorry to say we lost a friend a week and a half ago. Um.

**M: I’m so sorry.**

P: He would have given up on this. Like if you’re to the point where you’re already thinking of ways out and you go to login to try to make an appointment or to do some basic things and you can’t even get in. And you’re tired, and you’re exhausted, and you’re...you know. I’m just trying to give you guys ideas of what these servicemembers are dealing with and what their caregivers are dealing with. And not everyone’s healthy, mentally or physically. And sleep deprivation, from a caregiver perspective really does impact your ability to focus, to key in the right password number. It’s a lot. Some days more than others.

**M: Yeah, that does sound, that does sound really hard and I, I want to, you know, drive home that while we are doing research on you know just the login and that process, it’s really the human stories like what you’re sharing with us that are impactful and are helping to drive, you know, the softer side of VA that you’re hoping to see more of.**

P: [laughs] Thank you.

**M: It’s incredibly useful and I want to thank you for, you know, being so open and sharing these stories with us.**

P: No worries. You want me to try looking anything else here?

**M: No, that has been super—**

P: Let’s pretend I’m

**M: Oh sure, if you want to walk us through more, that’s great.  I do want to be respectful of your time. We have about 10 minutes left.**

P: Yeah, let’s go through what you guys need to do.

**M: Yeah, so we just have a couple more questions and, you know, you are welcome to continue walking through these screens as we ask them. One question that I have for you is that, you know, if I could give you a magic wand and there was anything you could change about this process, what would it be?**

P: Um, I would say make the password stuff a little less, like...there’s a lot of stuff on that page all the disclaimers you know there needs to be more white space. Sorry I’m a graphic designer journalist by trade so I look at it from the eyes of someone who’s suffering from extreme fatigue, potentially brain injury. And that login screen, let me go back to it. So, login. Let’s see what that’ll look like. You know, I do have an ID and me password. Do you want me to try using it and see what happens?

*[35:20]* **M: Sure.**

P: I’ve never done it before.

**M: We can go on this adventure together, then.**

P: I’m just curious. Oh cool, they already saved it from…

**M: So it looks like it sent you an email, there. Why is that?**

P: Um, to verify the email before I go onto that website. Here we go. Security. You know, and I get it. I want my husband’s stuff secure as well, but...okay. Thank you for confirming your email, okay...Alright, that’ll be the easiest way to go [chooses to receive an auth code by text message]. You can see this is putting me through quite a few hoops.

**M: Yeah, what do you think about that? Having, you know, these multiple steps that you need to get through?**

P: Um, I think it’s three steps too many. I was fortunate, though. I have my ID.me stuff saved, so I didn’t have to try to go through my copious amounts of passwords to look for it. But...again, through the eyes of someone with a brain injury or, you know, who hasn’t slept in since their first deployment, um, this would be too much. I’m still waiting for my verification code to come through. It hasn’t come. My phone’s faster than my computer. Let’s see, maybe they lied and they emailed it to me again. Nope. Yeah. So. That’s a bust.

**M: Yeah, no worries. That’s okay if we aren’t able to walk through that whole process. So you have mentioned you know with that magic wand…**

P: Maybe it was my fault, maybe I was supposed to type in…

**M: No, I didn’t even notice that either.**

P: Caregiver brain, sorry.

**M: No worries.**

P: Okay maybe now—oh look! It worked. Yeah, that was a dummy, but…ick. Oh good lord. [sighs] Okay, I would be breaking my computer right now if I was a guy. So I’m not going to go through all this crap when I already have the login done. Sorry, guys. I give up. Mea culpa.

**M: Do you recall if you had to do that for your other–MyHealtheVet and DS Logon—accounts?**

P: No, cause they saw us face to face at the VA.

**M: Gotcha.**

P: And you know, [name] used his ID card at the kiosk, so. Yeah. We didn’t have to give our first born or any of that. Um, do you want me to go through any other parts of the website?

**M: No, thank you. That’s great. Um, we have about 5 minutes left so I just want to ask—is there anything we haven’t talked about today that you think I should know?**

P: No, I think the takeaway is make one password, one sign-on that goes through all this stuff. And I know that’s not always possible when it connects you to another vendor, but I think a little more explanation and bolder font saying “you are being connected to another company’s website” like simple language. Simple, blunt, non-emotional, a lot of white space to give these guys more understanding of what they’re clicking into. And also make the search terms actually work cause you saw when I was looking for that letter you know proof of eligibility it didn’t really pull anything that was relevant. It pulled a bunch of other stuff that had some of the same words in it. But there’s gotta be a better way, like, most guys are going to Google, you know, “letter for property tax.” You know, “proof of disability.” That’s, that’s what that form is known as. Proof of disability. And there was nowhere where that was something to click on. It was a long, fancy, long, drawn out thing that, you know, my husband wouldn’t have known where to find that. They need to simplify their terms. Exactly what the meat is like. You know, “clothing allowance form.” Boom. “Prosthetics” being a search key cause anyone that deals with braces, and amputations, has to deal with prosthetics. That’s our unique situation. But just make the terms simpler, to the point and simplify the login process. I know DoD, when the DoD is involved, it’s like an extra pain in the ass. But they need to realize, you know, people need to access their benefits in a quick, easy, less frustrating way.

**M: This has all been amazing feedback. Thank you so much. Do you have, you know, any questions for me or any closing thoughts?**

P: No. Uh uh. I appreciate you guys looking at this and trying to make it easier for people to use because I think that’s one step in a lot of steps needed to make things a little more approachable.

**M: We certainly appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts today. This is, this has been very helpful for us as we, you know, continue to work on the site to make sure it really works for Veterans.**

P: And if you make any beta changes, you want me to look at it...I’ve done a lot of beta testing over the years, when we worked for Dell and [inaudible] stuff. I don’t mind looking and giving you guys feedback. That’s, if helping out could help some other man have his sanity and some dignity, then I’m all for it.

**M: Perfect, yeah. I will make sure to note that. And if you know anybody else, you know, Veterans, caregivers, other servicemembers you think might be willing to do something like what we did today in the future, uh, we can pass you on a little blurb for you to share with them as well.**

P: Yeah, please send that to me because I run a caregivers support group, so I have a lot of people that would really enjoy contributing.

**M: Excellent. Yeah. Great, well if you don’t have any other thoughts, that’s all we had for you today.**

P: Great, thank you.

**M: We really appreciate you taking the time. Thank you so much again, I really hope you enjoy the rest of your day. Thank your husband for his service for us.**

P: Great, thank you. Thank you so much, you have a great day.

**M: You too. Bye.**
