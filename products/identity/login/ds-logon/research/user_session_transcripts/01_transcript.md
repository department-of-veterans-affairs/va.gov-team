*[moderator reads opening script]*

*[00:35]* **M: What VA websites and application do you access online?**

P: MyHealthevet and I have used the website to dispute a claim, I’m not sure what the name of it is.

**M: How do you log in to those websites?**

P: With my DS, or whatever it is, [log site?]. It says it doesn’t recognize me and I haven’t tried to fix it.

**M: You said myHealthevet doesn’t recognize you, are there other VA services or benefits that you have had trouble accessing online?**

P: No.

**M: Could you walk me through how you got your log on accounts?**

P: How I log on my ID? I’m not sure what you said, I apologize.

**M: How did you set up your log on accounts, for myhealthevet for instance.**

P: How did I log onto the account? I’m not sure?

**M: Yeah, logging on, or getting your account set up in the first place.**

P: I just logged on to it. I don’t understand the question.

**M: Not a problem. Do you remember when you logged on if you had to verify your identity, or prove who you are?**

P: No when I logged on my, very seldom does it ask me to identify my identity. The one that I log on from changes the password frequently. 

**M: What is the one that you log on with again?**

P: The one I login the most?

**M: Mmm hmm.**

P: Myhealthevet.

**M: And when you are logging into myhealthevet, do you know which one you choose to login in with? I don’t know if you recall, but there are, I believe there are a couple of different options and I’m wondering which one do you use?**

P: The one I’m log in to is the premium option and it just gives me a, basically a desktop [dashboard?] and I go to whichever one I’m looking for whether it be messages or the, information on my recent visit or anything like that. Yeah that’s what I do.

**M: If I sent you a link, would you be willing to screen share and kind of walk us through how you log on?**

*[4:49]* P: That would be no problem.

**M: Great, give just one moment.**

*[Moderated drops link into chat box, spends a few minutes setting up screen share with participant.]*  

*[11:25]* **M: Perfect. Now if you go to myhealthevet in this browser, we’ll be able to follow along with you.**

P: ...ok it’s way at the top, so now I should bring it down? *[P closes out browser]*

**M: [name] you can open one of your internet browsers, like Google or Internet Explorer.**

P: I’ve got things all over my screen but nothing is together, you know what I’m saying?

**M: Yeah, no worries.** *[Directs him to Google Chrome]*

*[participant accidentally shared wrong screen, moderator decides to open screenshare on her computer]*

**M: Let me just do a little magic on my side and we can pull it up on my computer, sound good?**

P: okie dok.

**M: Just one sec.**

*[15:18]* **M: Alright are you able to see my screen now?**

P: I’m seeing the healthevet screen, is that the one I’m supposed to be seeing?

**M: Yeah, perfect. So we’ll do this a little differently, basically now that I have this up, I’d love for you to walk me through what you do once you get here.**

P: Ok, what I do, I’d go to login.

**M: Ok, so I’ll pretend to be you in this instance, that good?**

P: Ok, so when it comes up I go to use the sign in partner.

**M: Ok, and which one of these do you choose?**

P: Sign in with DS Logon

**M: This one here?**

P: Yep. [DS Logon screen with disclaimer/warning text]  I have to accept. And then it tells me not to put anything on here that would upset the boss.

**M: And what is this screen telling you?**

P: Essentially it’s telling me that um, different things I can do to verify my identity. If I don’t have an account I can in-person proof by visiting this VA, if I’m a veteran receiving funds I can use the telephone proofing process to verify my identity. I can get a premium DS Logon account which I have. You can get an account if you use an email verification, if you have an ID card, which I don’t, I’m retired. But you can call the computer repair center and {inaudible} that process, which I didn’t because at the time I had a card when I signed up. You can request a DS Logon through mail, it’s got a lot of information. Military sponsors request premium DS Logon, and retirees can use the DFAS mypay login to create a premium level DS Logon account. I don’t go to DFAS because I’m a VA retiree, so. Alright, then protect your information, when you finish, close, that way you don’t lose your information to some hacker, and keep my phone number and email address updated, which I do. And they’re going to do additional things for security, cause I did get hacked so it’s happened before.

*[18:42]* **M: I have a couple questions for you about this in person proofing you talked about. Did you go either of these two options [on the screen].**

P: Did I do that?

**M: Yeah?**

P: That was a long time ago, I did that in person in [state].

**M: Could you tell me a little about what that process was like?**

P: Oh golly, that was 7, 8, 9, 10, 15 years ago. I don’t know. Yeah, they looked at my VA card. I think I had to provide a DD214, or they had one. And they, somebody came along and validated it wherever I signed up. They validated it. I don’t think they required any further information because I was already receiving benefits and I was already in the system.

**M: Have you ever had to set up other accounts beside your premium DS Logon account?**

P: Do you mean personal accounts or other VA accounts?

**M: Other VA accounts, yeah.**

P: Just the one that I use when I was increasing my VA disability. It’s the only one I’ve ever used. I don’t use Pay [MyPay] or anything like that. I generally go to these two websites, this one more than the other ‘cause it tracks my health and things like that, and I use the doctor.

**M: And when you say these two websites, you mean myhealthevet and which one?**

P: What now?

**M: What was the other website you go to?**

P: I wish I could think the name of it, it’s the VA website where you can file claim. I mean, it’s the VA.gov website I’m pretty sure. And there’s another place you can check your benefits, you can do this. I think you can get on that website from here but I’m not sure. When I use my DS Logon, I can get to every account I want to. Because it gives you, you know, the military accounts and all this other stuff. So if I want to get on an account, I just go to this one, the myhealthevet, I can go into, and when I do my DS Logon, I have to go to a share site where it says you wanna log in, which one. And I can log in with any of those accounts, but I use myhealthevet, is what I use. There’s another one in there that gives you your progress on claims and stuff like that, and I used that one frequently when I was applying for an increase in my disability claim, which was approved. But I don’t use that one much anymore because there’s no reason to. If I need to get a letter or something from them then I go and use that account. I don’t know if that made any sense.

*[22:52]*  **M: Yeah, let me, kind of, repeat that back and see if I understood that correctly. You basically will come here [Myhealth.va.gov] for any sort of veteran/VA site that you need to visit, and then you'll come through and login with your myhealthevet and then if you need to get to anything else, you’ll be able to do that once you’ve logged in? Is that correct?**

P: I use my DS Logon, so I don’t use healthevet. Then when I go to DS Logon, I can go to a different series of websites that are available under the DS Logon. One of those happens to be myhealthevet [Myhealth.va.gov], so that’s how I log onto myhealthevet. My password for myhealthvet [login account] never works, and when I try to recover it they tell me they can’t find my account. Don’t know why, don’t care, because I can log on with my DS Logon so I don’t feel like messing with it.

*[24:08]* **M: Gotcha, so you’re saying this part, over in the left [myhealthevet sign in box], never works for you?**

P: Yeah, I never use that one. I always use the sign in partner [right side of screen]. 

**M: Gotcha, so I will come back to the DS Logon screen, and I’d love to have you walk me through what happens once you’re here, especially in this bottom part of the screen** *[moderator clicks DS Logon link].*

P: Ok, then what happens is my DS Logon comes on, my user name and my password, and I then I just hit login and it goes to myhealthvet, and I can use the dashboard, whatever I want to. All this stuff down here [account options list at bottom of screen, I only use if it’s necessary to change things or whatever. That’s pretty much on the DS Logon screen, not on the other myhealthvet screen. Now the CAC card I don’t have, since I don’t work for the government anymore, I’m retired, I don’t have a CAC card anymore. I did have.

**M: Gotcha. So you’ll use this DS Logon side..Let me make sure I understood correctly, so when you do want to login with DS Logon, you actually don’t go to this page first [myhealth.va.gov] you go to a different page, is that correct?**

P: No, this is the page I come to first.

**M: Ok. Perfect, great, just wanted to make sure I understood you.**

P: The first page I come to is where you [inaudible] sign in partner, which is this one. And then when I click that, the page says I have to accept their terms, and then it goes to the next page when I accept, and that’s where it gives me the opportunity to log in. So yeah, it’s a three-step process.

*[26:21]* **M: Awesome. Are there ever instances where someone else is logging in for you? Like a caregiver or spouse, or something like that?**

P: Nope.

**M: Have you ever used a VCO or VCO representative for any part of this process?**

P: Nope.

**M: And after you’ve logged in..I won’t pretend to be you, but let’s pretend you were doing this and you put in your user name and password and you click log on, is there another screen that you get after you login that asks you for, you know, a special code that you get texted or emailed to you, anything like that?**

P: No..the only time I get a third screen is when my password is set to expire. Then it tells me I have to log on with a new password and I need to create it now. And it goes through and creates...all my passwords are remembered on my computer I don’t know if that’s a good thing or a bad thing. I have three levels of security on my system, so I’m pretty sure I’m safe with that. I use a VPN, and I also use internal security, so..I should be. My name has been hacked in the VA, once, my OPM file, and a couple of credit cards were hacked, and my security clearance was hacked but I don’t think it’s ever been used. And I think, there’s probably others...Most of my information that is available on this website is my health information, and I don’t know why anyone would want that anyways. Anything else, is internal to OPM, or the agency I work for.   

*[29:15]* **M: I’m really sorry to hear about all the instances where you’ve had trouble with security, but it does sound like something that’s really important to you. I’m wondering, what are your thoughts on DS Logon and security?**

P: I like DS Logon. For one thing, when I do log on to DS Logon, I’m logging on through a different website, so that means my password and username are not protected by the VA, they’re protected by DS. The VA, as far as they’re concerned, doesn’t even have a password for me. So the only time they know when I logged on is when they track me through my usage of the website. And therefore they don’t keep records of what I’m doing in terms of my log on, they only capture the fact that I’m on the website. The DS Logon captures my login and the information that I log onto which is ok with me, because I think they have a more secure website, or log on procedures than myhealthevet. I don’t know, it makes me feel better that I’m logging on through the DS Logon rather than myhealthevet. It’s a personal thing, nothing prudent about it I’m sure.

**M: Yeah that makes sense to me. Your feeling is that because you’re not giving, say the VA.gov website your password and user name but you’re using DS Logon, there’s that kind of extra, buffer almost, of security. Does that capture what you’re saying?**

P: Yeah, DS Logon is limited to people who have either worked for the government, or currently work for the government. Whereas the VA website is any veteran in any capacity, can log onto that website. So I guess it’s a level, one level higher than the VA logon. It’s probably just me. 

*[32:14]* **M: Well it sounds like you’re very security minded, so I think that, your thoughts on that are really useful for us to hear. I know we have another 15 minutes or so, so I kind of wanted to move on to some of our closing questions, so that we can be really cognizant of your time and respectful of that. So just a couple of last questions for you. This one is a little out of the ballpark so just bear with me. Let’s pretend you had a magic wand and you could change something about the process of getting a VA account, or perhaps logging on with DS Logon, what would you change about the process of logging into VA websites?**

P: For DS Logon, or for Myhealthevet?

**M: For either, anything you would want to change.**

P: DS Logon is difficult, at best, to remember. And I think it’s DS Logon that requires me to put in my new password before I can log on again. In other words, it doesn’t go right into log on it starts all over again. And in some cases, fortunately I think it’s stopped that, it doesn’t capture the new password in my password locker, and therefore I have to remember what it was.  I’m old, like a lot of other guys who use it and they probably don’t remember what they just put in as their password. That sounds stupid but it’s true. Once you put something in and it’s not shown to you, you may have written it down wrong or you may have remembered it wrong, and it doesn’t come out the way you want it to and you have to go through the whole process again.  DS Logon changes their log on requirement every three or four months, I don’t know how often it is, but I know it’s relatively quickly. Whereas, I don’t know about the healthy vet log on, if they change it often, they should. I think the biggest thing you can do with protecting a password is not use it over and over again. For some websites I’m very careful in the way I logon, other it doesn’t matter. For something to do with a social affair I don’t really worry about that. For some websites I may change my password more often or put different [encryptions?] in it. I think that DS Logon is pretty easy to use, except for the password, trying to remember it is not all that easy sometimes. And you have to remember it, And they don’t tell you have to remember it until you’ve already forgot it. You don’t usually write it down I guess.

*[36:10]* **M: What happens if you do forget it, how do you resolve that?**

P: If you forgot your password or user name, if I’m not mistaken, they send an email to your email address to go to the page where you can create a new password or they will give you your username but not your password. So if I forget me password, the first thing I have to remember is my user name, and I believe they will send that to you through your email, and they ask security questions before they send you that email. I have security questions on all of them. 

**M: Gotcha, that makes sense. Is there anything we haven’t talked about today that you think we should know?**

P: Yeah I would like to see more VA opportunities under myhealthevet, like maybe a direct link to go to apply or increase your benefits. Too many websites get confusing to people, and if you have something like major PTSD and you’re trying to do all this stuff, it can get frustrating. And if the VA had just one website with the menu of different possibilities, like, I want increase my VA compensation, or I want to to debate it, if that automatically sent you to the other website rather than having to go and log in all over again. I’m assuming that’s not there now and I can’t see if it is, but I don’t recall that ever being there. The other thing is when I go onto myhealthevet, sometimes I have a hard time understanding all the things on there, it’s like the blue button, I have no idea what the blue button is. Or how I can get my records, when I always try to get my records but can’t get my records. Some of those things are a little bit more confusing than I would like them to be, so it goes into a little more explanation of what I’m about to get and what I can do with them. I know I had to..I applied for an insurance policy and they did a physical and they sent away a form that I signed to get my medical records, and the VA came back and said you have to use our forms. And that took more time on my insurance policy. There ought to be a way to fill out the forms on the VA website that doesn’t require you to print off forms. Once you’re on the website you should be able to do anything on the website that you can do in person. Because your password should be the key to you being able to do that. And a lot of the time you can’t. All the government websites are like that, for some reason they haven’t converted to PDF filler, etc. You have to print them out and start all over again.

*[40:49]* **M: Those are all great ideas. I think that’s it for the question we have for you, do you have any questions for me?**

P: No, I appreciate you moving in there and taking over, I was having a heck of a time there.

**M: My pleasure.**
