## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Lauryl Zenobi and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about your experiences setting up VA accounts and logging into VA websites. Specifically, we’re interested in your experiences with DS Logon. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?**

## Warm-up Questions

Let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

- What VA websites or application do you access online? How do you login to each of those websites? 
  - VA.gov, MHV, eBenefits
  - I log into MHV using their system, on eBenefits I use DS Logon, on VA.gov I either use DS Logon or ID.me
    - Depends what computer I’m on; if it’s a public computer I use ID.me
    - They use your email address instead of a username
- Are there VA services or benefits that you are unable to access online?
  - Online appointment maker for VHA shouldn’t be so hard to use
    - Takes a long time
    - You can’t just pick a slot
    - You can only make an appointment 60-90 days in advance

## Credentialing processes

- How did you get your login account(s)? Can you walk me through that process?
  - The first one was MHV
    - It’s been a long time, I think I just signed up when I signed up for healthcare
    - It’s been at least a decade
  - eBenefits I had to request a login and then they mailed it to me
    - It’s been a while
    - It’s possible that they prompted me to set up the account when I became service connected
    - I don’t remember it being hard, but I don’t struggle with these online systems like a lot of people do
    - Later on I discovered you could file claims with it so I used it for filing some claims
- Did you have to do identify verification? What was that process like?
  - eBenefits I forgot my password and it was like if you’re trying to set up an online checking account. They asked questions from public records like mortgages, addresses
- Have you had to get multiple types of accounts for logging into VA sites?
- What was an instance where you needed to set up another account?
- What has been your experience with DS Logon? ID.me? My HealtheVet? With other types of accounts?
-  What level of trust do you have with these logins?
  - At work we have a secure account, at home I don’t worry about it because I’m on my private internet
  - On a public internet I always want to use ID.me [because they use 2FA - according to earlier in the convo, because it uses email rather than a username]
  - [when attempting to log in, authentication failed] It might be because I’m logged in in another tab
    - I don’t recall having this problem before
- What is it like when you have to log in to multiple sites?
  - Now you have no choice because if you file a claim through eBenefits you can only track it through VA.gov
  - On VA.gov you can send secure messages and order prescriptions, but you can’t see or handle appointments
    - At some point you’re going to have to go to eBenefits or MHV
    - Your pay history is not available on VA.gov; you have to go over to eBenefits to see it
       - It’ll automatically move you over there, you don’t have to log out and log back in
- As an active-duty service member, what sort of online account(s) did you have? How does the VA account process compare to other online accounts that you’ve set up?

## Log-on processes

- Would you be comfortable with screen-sharing your login process with me and talking me through how you login?
  - I would prefer if they gave the choice between email and cell phone
  - [on MHV] I’m not worried about how secure the system is
    - I think it’s going away soon -- a lot of the features are already on VA.gov
- Which VA site do you log into most often?
- [For veterans] Do you have others that log on for you (like a care-giver or a VCO)? Tell me about some instances when you would have someone log in for you. 
  - No, the VSO who helped me file my first claim mailed or faxed it in for me
- Have you ever worked with a VCO/VCO representative? Why? What was that process like?
- [For care-givers] Are there instances where you’ll use someone else’s login? Tell me about that process.
- When you log in, are there multiple options for how to log in? If so, which do you use? Why do you choose that option?
- Have you ever found yourself unable to log in?
  - On eBenefits, yes
  - eBenefits is a VA DoD system - eBenefits gets the most usage
- How often does this occur? 
  - Over the course of a few years, I’ve filed for many different things
  - It’s gotten much better in the past year
  - In the past I had significantly more trouble
  - Over the course of a year, I don’t log in that often; probably about once a month
    - My open claims have moved over to VA.gov
    - I have an outstanding claim and I don’t need to track it on eBenefits
- What do you do when this happens?
  - Come back later
  - Especially on a weekend, they seem to be doing a lot of updates, and you’ll see [more errors] on a Monday morning, which seems to be left over from the updates they did on the weekend
- Once you provide your login credentials, are you asked to provide a second form of authentication, like a code sent to your phone or email? What do you think of that?
  - I always get this when I log into VA.gov
  - IRS gives you a choice of whether to receive the code on your phone or email -- I prefer that
  - I don’t mind the two-part authentication
  - There are probably a million people out there trying to steal your data

## Final questions

- If you had a magic wand and could change something about the process of getting a VA account or logging in, what would it be?
  - It would be better if they were all in one system and you could do everything in one system
  - My understanding is they want to migrate everything over [to VA.gov]
  - In eBenefits you can get to DEERS
  - It’d be great if you could do everything in VA.gov instead of going back and forth
  - It’d be better on VA.gov if you could select what you could see on your homepage
- Is there anything we haven’t talked about today that you think I should know?
  - If you go to eBenefits the army is saying now through eBenefits you can access your military records if you were discharged after 2000, but some veterans say it doesn’t work
- Any questions for me? 
  - Not off the top of my head
- How do you keep track of all your passwords?
  - They’re all the same password
  - It’s all the same system, and on ID.me you have the two-part authentication so you don’t have to worry so much about the password

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
