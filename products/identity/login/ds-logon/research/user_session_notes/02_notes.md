## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Lauryl Zenobi and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about your experiences setting up VA accounts and logging into VA websites. Specifically, we’re interested in your experiences with DS Logon. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?**

## Warm-up Questions

Let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

- What VA websites or application do you access online? How do you login to each of those websites? 
  - I access eBenefits, DS Logon, DEERS, and MHV
    - [my husband, the veteran] and I got married last year
    - DEERS lets you see who has access to what, who can make decisions on your behalf
    - We log in with ID.me
    - We noticed that remote proofing has been turned off on eBenefits
    - I log in to eBenefits using DS Logon
- Are there VA services or benefits that you are unable to access online?

## Credentialing processes

- How did you get your login account(s)? Can you walk me through that process?
- Did you have to do identify verification? What was that process like?
- Have you had to get multiple types of accounts for logging into VA sites?
- What was an instance where you needed to set up another account?
- What has been your experience with DS Logon? ID.me? My HealtheVet? With other types of accounts?
- What level of trust do you have with these logins?
- As an active-duty service member, what sort of online account(s) did you have? How does the VA account process compare to other online accounts that you’ve set up?

## Log-on processes

- Would you be comfortable with screen-sharing your login process with me and talking me through how you login?
  - So there’s two logins [on MHV], that’s different
  - I usually sign in with DS Logon because that’s the one I have saved in my phone
    - I have all my passwords in my notes app on my iphone
    - We’ve been having issues so we had to change the password so I don’t know what it is now
       - That’s the biggest headache, when one of us changes the password and don’t inform each other 
  - [husband] often forgets his password and login and often creates new ones
    - Then I don’t know what it is
  - We haven’t had to change our passwords for a long time but we had to change it recently because we got a letter from the VA
  - This is the process, this is our life, it’s always a shitshow because he’s always changing passcodes and I’m always changing passcodes
  - I would go into password recovery [if my husband wasn’t there to give me the new password]
  - We’ve also gotten locked out because I thought I was answering security questions correctly and I was wrong
  - What if my husband were in the hospital and I couldn’t access this because I don’t know his sister’s middle name?
  - It’s important for me to be able to access information quickly and if this website messes around and I can’t that’s really frustrating
  - If there were a way to pre-approve someone to access an account for you that would be easier
  - Vets come with traumatic brain injuries, PTSD, this stuff is really hard. You have to have a Masters or a PHD in DS Logon just to use this
  - CIRCLE JERK OF ANGER
  - Two-factor auth would be so much simpler than security questions
  - Husband: I use my phone for almost everything because I hate computers
  - It’s super complicated, security questions are hard to remember
- Which VA site do you log into most often?
- [For veterans] Do you have others that log on for you (like a care-giver or a VCO)? Tell me about some instances when you would have someone log in for you. 
- Have you ever worked with a VCO/VCO representative? Why? What was that process like?
- [For care-givers] Are there instances where you’ll use someone else’s login? Tell me about that process.
  - I don’t set up accounts. I came into the picture after my husband was medically retired so he already had all this set up, I access it
  - When I need to access this particular thing I have to ask him for his login
  - I pretty much have all the logins available, except for when they get changed
- When you log in, are there multiple options for how to log in? If so, which do you use? Why do you choose that option?
  - Husband: why isn’t MHV and eBenefits the same thing
  - Participant: isn’t DS Logon supposed to cover everything?
  - Husband: I have to remember two logins and two passwords
    - I have eBenefits and MHV
  - We use eBenefits to access VA letters and things like that
  - Husband: my phone doesn’t even have this password
    - Participant: the iphone asks you if you want to automatically save the password
      - I think DS is supposed to be the umbrella login
      - But if there were an umbrella login that you could assign an approved caregiver and maybe a backup caregiver in case of emergency that would be so much easier
      - Have a caregiver be vetted by the VA and get them cleared just in case of emergency so they’ll have that stupid code
      - By the time I get the information I need it’s so hard that I’m so pissed off I’m in a bad mood for like four hours afterward
  - We often get locked out for 24-48 hours
- Have you ever found yourself unable to log in?
- How often does this occur? 
- What do you do when this happens?
- Once you provide your login credentials, are you asked to provide a second form of authentication, like a code sent to your phone or email? What do you think of that?
  - No, I haven’t seen this, and even if it did I’m so pissed off that I just want to get in and get out
  - We have four kids, I don’t have time to sit here and mess around, but we need letters or we need to see when appointments are
  - “It’s hard Lauryl! Help me, I’m poor!”
  - “This is the fun game we do [of not being able to remember the right password]. It’s a shitshow.”
  - And we’d try this. And when that doesn’t work, I’ll say “I have a diaper to change, I have a baby to feed. I’ll do this later”
  - Husband: toward the end of active duty I still had a CAC card so I could get in with that, and it was much simpler
    - The VA should go to a CAC card system rather than what they have now
  - [Husband]: Who’s to say I don’t get in a really bad car accident -- 
  - [Participant]: and then I’m stuck with no access to anything and I’m screwed!
  - It needs to be streamlined and it needs to be a sure thing. Otherwise why does it even exist
  - I write down every password I have.
  - Every time we have to log in it’s always a chore.
  - If you want to give me a scale [of difficulty] of 0 to organic chem, this is organic chem
  - Husband: I don’t want to deal with this ever because I know how hard it is and it puts me in a bad mood
  - Participant: we take the same steps every time and sometimes it’s like “Welcome!” and sometimes it’s like “Fuck you, it’ll take 72 hours and give us your first born”
  - We try to log in about four times a month

## Final questions

- If you had a magic wand and could change something about the process of getting a VA account or logging in, what would it be?
  - I would make it so there’s one type of login, and I would make it so that it could be access it even if I forgot the username and password, so I could put in a trusted phone number and it could send us a code to get in, and it would send us the updated login and password so we know what it is and we could save it
  - Even a code generator app for verification would be amazing
- Is there anything we haven’t talked about today that you think I should know?
  - Simplifying the process
  - Veterans are not like civilian people; they have limitations, and sometimes those limits cap at a lower rate than civilians
  - Make it so it’s not such a clusterfuck of crazy!
  - I called [the whitehouse hotline] but I don’t know if they would be able to access DS Login information and help with that
    - It was legit and she was awesome but a lot of the questions I asked her she referred me out to other phone numbers
  - That frustration that you heard from [my husband]’s voice, that’s the real shit. That’s the trenches of having to deal with this online stuff.
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
