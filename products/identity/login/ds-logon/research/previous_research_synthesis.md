## Takeaways to inform DS Logon Research
- Multi-factor authentication can be difficult for communities that use accessibility tools
  - _Recognize that this may come up during DS Logon research_
- Users have differing views and experiences with identity proofing processes. Some find answering credit history questions unnerving and invasive, other find uploading documents to identity proof too time consuming
  - **How do users do identity proofing for DS Logon? What is the user experience of getting a DS Logon credential? Are there user pain points/needs that are unique to DS Logon?**
- Users find errors in the login process frustrating
  - **What errors occur for DS Logon? How do users resolve errors?**
- When errors occur, users do not want to reach out to external sources, like a Help Desk, in order to complete their tasks
  - **Does DS Logon provide any self-service options?**
- DS Logon does not have strong brand awareness
  - **Do people recognize DS Logon as a credential for multiple VA resources, or only as a way to sign into eBenefits?**
- Trust and security are major concerns for users
  - **How is DS Logon perceived by users?**

## Prior Research
### Signing in with assistive technology (March 2019)
- Research goal: test the usability of the sign in process with Veterans who use screen readers such as JAWS for Windows, NVDA, or Voiceover for Mac
- 7 male veteran participants, 6 of whom primarily use a screen reader to interact with websites and web applications
- Navigation around the VA.gov homepage was fairly easy, but finding the Sign In button was difficult
  - Most users searched for “log in.”
- Participants didn't understand why they would log into VA.gov when everything they used is on My HealtheVet
  - However, using MHV to sign in to VA.gov was successful for all participants
- When logging in with ID.me users were sent an email to confirm their address, which caused confusion and delays
- 2FA was difficult
  - Some participants can only complete multifactor through phone calls and can have a hard time using the code from either method
  - Some participants said that they would not set up 2FA if they knew they had to enter the code every time they signed in to the site

### Identity verification, round 2 (November 2018)
- Follow-up to the research done in September 2018
- Research goal: validate login, identity verification workflows, and error messages relating to MHV services
  - Identity verification = after the user is logged in, when trying to access a service like prescription refills, they must go through a secondary process such as answering questions about their credit history to verify their identity
  - In previous sessions, users encountered errors they found confusing, so this session tests rewording of the errors
- All five participants were able to complete all of the tasks successfully
- Most of the participants were willing to complete the identity verification process in order to access tools on VA.gov
- Most participants felt that uploading documents (driver's license, passport, etc.) would be more time-consuming and difficult than answering questions about their credit history
- Participants understood the errors they ran into but expressed frustration at the thought of having to call the Help Desk to continue the task

### Identity verification, round 1 (September 2018)
- Research goal: validate login/account workflows and content when users attempt to access MyHealtheVet tools from VA.gov
- Participants were hesitant to complete the identity verification process, but most said that they would complete the process to access online health tools like “Refill Your Prescriptions.”
  - Participants expressed anxiety about verifying their identity by answering credit history questions.
- Participants were confused and frustrated by several of the errors they encountered relating to account upgrades

### MHV Login Flows for ID.me (June 2018)
- Research goal: validate improvements to the Connect Account, Two-factor, and Identity Verification flows on Vets.gov
- Providing context (what came before, what's happening now, what will happen next) helps
- Contextual help improves understanding and confidence
- Plain language improves confidence
- During the 2FA flow, some participants weren't sure the revised language explained what would happen when they logged in next time (whether they would have to complete 2FA each time)

### MHV Upgrade (March 2018)
- Research goal: after login, to use some MHV features veterans must further verify their identity and “upgrade their account” (which is a back-end process requiring no input from them apart from confirming they want to upgrade)
  - This testing validates a rough draft of this flow
- 6/8 participants were confused but the additional step of verifying their identity after logging in and going through 2FA
  - Thought 2FA should be enough to verify their identity
- Most participants did not notice any of the help text or links to FAQ
- Many were confused about what happened when they upgraded their account and how it would impact their access to MHV

### Login flow improvements (July-August 2017)
- Users don’t see the value in creating an account
  - Need a reason to go through the effort
- Users expect to be able to use their existing MHV / DS Logon account to sign in to Vets.gov, not create a new one
- When given options of how to log in, most users chose MHV
- "DS Logon" brand isn't always familiar to people, even though a lot of them have used eBenefits and therefore have a DS Logon account
- Users have trust and security concerns with a different service (ID.me) handling their MHV/DS Logon info
- Users found the process of signing up through ID.me, confirming their account credentials, and setting up 2FA to be long and arduous
- ID.me has strong brand awareness; most of the users had already signed up for ID.me on a different website
