## Week of 4/17 

Our goal was to test two versions of the flow from after a Veteran (without a MHV account) logs in to vets.gov and LOA3 verifies and wants to use view health tools. 

Key research questions:

Was it clear to the Veteran what they are being asked to do?
Was the language for the consent and terms & conditions clear?
Can they complete the flow to get access to the tools?
Did they understand they can select one without the other? (re medical consent vs t&c)

We spoke with 3 Veterans. 

The conversation guide can be found here: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/login/mhv/mhv-account-creation/mhv-upgrade/research/conversationguide-4-17-17.md

Mockups: https://marvelapp.com/3687i59 and https://marvelapp.com/5995e2b/screen/26766158 

## Key Takeaways

- 3/3 Veterans wanted to select both boxes to get access to features. 
- It was clear to 3/3 Veterans that they would see this page only once. 

## What worked

- Havin the terms and conditions as a link instead of all the text on the page (2/3 said they wouldn't read it.)
- Login version was more clear for 1 Veteran because it was upfront and an early task

## What didn't work

- Having tools split by wall of dense text in a box was a worse experience for 3/3 Veterans
- Wanted more security information available.  Looked for verification or Norton to see if it's trustworthy. 
- Blue box for health benefits was not clear you could view prescriptions. 
- Veteran expressed that it was too much reading on the page
- Veteran preferred having 1 check box with medical consent as part of the Terms and Conditions  

## Additional Learnings

- 2/3 number of Veterans did not trust the id.me login or had problems with it initially  
- content on blue boxes, especially health benefits, should include what tools are available 
- ability to comment on docotors notes if he disagrees with them 
- Footer gave Veteran a clear view of what is on the site. 
- Security and showing we are secure is important to all Veterans 

## Quotes

- “If I’m on here and I’m at this point I clearly want to use the website to do something or see what’s on there so I wouldn’t back out at this point because of that.” (Re viewing it at login) 
- "Raises question of why do I need to add my consent for my records.  If I’m on a VA website, I would think I can access those as is”
- "More intuitive [to have the temrs and conditions and medical consent with health tools], didn’t have to access my records until I clicked on some health care stuff.  More logical and natural to give consent to something like that while you’re trying to access them." 
- "I would back out of this." [when trying to find view of prescriptions and can't find it.]
