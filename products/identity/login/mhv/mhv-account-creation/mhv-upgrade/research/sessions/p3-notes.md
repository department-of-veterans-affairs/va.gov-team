## Participant 3:

- Hasn’t used Vets.gov before but has heard of it
-	I go to MHV.gov a VA department website 
-	I use that mostly but go into eBenefits from time to time but not as often as MHV
-	Haven’t done secure messaging with VA and rarely with private doctors
-	Probably 4 years ago [created mhv account]
-	[mhv account creation] Finding the site was easy enough but I think all I had to do was come up with user name and password and then there was 3 tier category of what kind of account you have I thin it’s basic, advanced and premium and I had no idea what those were or explanation on what the differences were and because I had a disability rating I was given an advanced and not sure how to get premium or what it does
-	After that the button navigation was moderately easy sort of intuitive but had to do some exploring to get to what I wanted to get to and I noticed right away there is a blue button function and that’s supposed to be where you push the blue button and you can get a download or readout of your medical records 
-	[Blue button] I’ve never been able to get to do it—that you have to go to your doctor to get
-	Ten minutes to create it—figure out what I was doing [time it took to create mhv]
-	What I like if I have to create an account I like to do user name and password and bang 
-	Password has to be this or that a little chunkiness—I like it to be a minute two minutes 

[Task]
[clicks sign in ]

- oh you can sign in with ds logon 
-	in my case I would sign in with MHV 
-	looks just like mhv 
-	can you see any of this information ?
-	I don’t know what secure your account means 
-	If ID.me is what I think it is I think I did it recently when I was applying for a membership that allowed dd214 to get a discount I think they used id.me they verify your military service is that what it is?
-	Secure your account optional—if it’s optional what are my options do I have to go back and then not get access so it’s really not optional?
-	It would be annoying because it says optional but I don’t know what it is I don’t know what id.me is and I’m not sure I want to do that there is a dotted line that says return to vets.gov and then says vets.gov uses id.me for added security but what happens if you don’t put something in so it’s really not optional—if you want to precede you have to do this 
-	I might open up another tab to do research on id.me 
-	I want to know what id.me is before I start clicking buttons on the screen
-	I’d like to hover over what is id.me to get more information like a question mark icon 
-	Then I’ll go ahead and put in my email address 

[goes back to sign in page]

- oh there it is right now—I saw MHV which is what I know I didn’t bother to read what was on the right about id.me
-	there is your learn more about id.me I think that’s great and if I click on this it would answer my question 
-	clicks on faqs
-	trusted va partner and only 1 of 4…continues reading faqs
-	okay yeah then I would, this would make me more willing to create an id.me account and probably skip that step
-	if someone is impulsive like I am and clicks on what I know it would be nice to have this faq info on the email page so that if you get that far you can know 

[goes back through the flow]
[secure your account]

-	oh there is more security 
-	I would go with phone or text option 
-	I would want to receive a text
-	Then I get the code
-	Okay click continue 

[now on homepage]

- trying to get to secure message area hmm I don’t see it up here [goes to top nav]

[Verify page]

-	At this juncture, um, fail safe—this is PHI so you don’t want to leak or a spillage on this info and personally I don’t want it out there either—I got through the outer fence now this is the inner—it’s to make sure I am who I say I am
-	Outer fence part is the steps that I’ve been through and now that I’ve logged in with my username and password or id.me account I’m inside that wall I’ve gotten that code and phone is verified code is verified now I’m instead the perimeter so to speak and I’m going to get my communication one more time they want to verify my identity 
-	The only confusion right now is the one time process takes 5-10 minutes to complete I thought I just did that but if I were Sean I would verify my identity 
-	Yeah that makes sense to me [faqs why do I need to verify]
-	I thought I did it already but I understand the need—I have to go thorough 4 identity verifications to log into my computer at work so this is familiar--I  work for DoD

[goes back to verify flow]

-	I would verify with question 

[Enters name, address, ssn, phone number, verify info]

[goes through questions]

-	I have used this before or something very similar 

[Sees t&c]

-	Now this is a one time thing so when I get another message for my doctor and go online I won’t have to go through this again right

[went right through t&c didn’t read or talk about it]

-	the id.me part seems to be two discreet parts the first one where you are creating your account and you have to do that and you are good to go but then once you create the account you have to do this step which is identity verification 
-	I don’t know if that’s really what happens but that’s what it seems 
-	I’ve never seen passport or drivers license and I’m sitting here in a pair of pjs and the passport is in a lock box it’s easier to answer questions 
-	When I got to questions I thought it would be like what is your first pets name, model of car, maiden name, not “it looks like in 2009 you applied for mortgage” oh wow that was fast they have that kind of access to my info that quickly that’s surprising but I’ve done something similar to this before and I think it was id.me

[Revisits t&c]

-	I think this is legislated now it was passed strictly governing the handling and release of PHI 
-	Oh boy I wish I had done it on MHV before—I would expect to log on as usual and go straight into the messaging itself 
-	I haven’t used SM before on MHV
-	I do it over the phone or in person because the CBOC is a three minute walk from my house 

[on reading t&c] I recognize it for what it is and not read it I tend to scan it and make your eye soft so you can see oh that word jumped out at me it’s like trying to read the iTunes agreement you’re never going to do it 

[Mike informs on what happens on the backend] oh whatever that means haha I still don’t know what that means 

-	That’s great now how would I know that I got upgraded, would I get a message or would the screen tell me or just from logging in the next time 
-	I want to know what is happening on mhv because it’s not a bad thing but if logging into creating an account with vets.gov automatically bumps me to premium hey that’s a great thing even though I don’t know what is involved
-	When I go to MHV I expect it to look the same as before and if I go there and I notice I have a premium I’m not going to make a connection 
-	Without an explanation I wont know why and what that means 
-	If I don’t know that doing this then I’m going to be wondering how that happened 
-	That would be helpful to use bb [when told he could do that
-	The steps I did today I would say most of them were to protect my PHI there is a lot of stuff past the admin stuff a lot of effort to verify my identity 
-	I think it’s definitely worth it because right now today sitting in Fredericksburg if I have to go to a doctor I can zip over but next month I’m going to be in California and I might need to contact my doctor I can pick up the phone but 3 hour time difference and if I can just open my laptop and fire it off I think that makes it worthwhile 
-	After creating account I had to do the second layer that surprised me which is not to say alarm 
-	Mhv is setup now and I have an account and that’s how I manage my health—dashboard, rx, and then this vets.gov is this intended to be complimentary to mhv or subplant mvh or how does this fit in or does it 
-	He then asked a few questions about how mhv fits in and Natalie jumped in to answer and didn’t take notes
