## Participant 6:

- Used vets gov before
- I think i have. to renew my prescriptions.

"What other sites or online tools have you used?"
- Call in for appointments, i recently learned how to do [garbled]

"Do you have a MHV account?"
- I think I did set up one.

"Have you done anything - have you used secure messaging or downloaded health records?"
- No

"What other sites or tools have you used to deal with health care or health insurance?"
- Nothing

#### on Sign in/up page
- I think I just need to sign in with DSLogon. 
- That's what I do to get to my prescriptions.

#### on IDme sign in
- Sign up with my account. I would sign in with Facebook or my email.
- You know what I do have a school account, username is so long. I can't remember exactly.

#### on 2FA complete sign in
- A lot of times that's how you sign in to a lot of things online. It's verification you're signing in

#### on Complete your sign in
- It texts  me a code and I enter it and hit continue

#### on Home page
"Anything surprising about the process?"
- No cause I've done that on other websites

#### on FAQs - Verify why
- So you're not doing anything illegal, getting illegal information
- Make sure you're you. Great. It's security to your information.

"What kinds of concerns would you have securing your information?"
- There's identity theft out there. Someone can probably use my info to get disability claims that I don't even know about.

"Does this give you new info?"
- Yeah I've seen it on other sites, but this is new to me on vetsgov. I thought it was a pain in the butt, but it's necessary.

"Anything else you're curious about the verification step?"
- No

"Any of these questions interesting to you?"
- Nah I've seen them before

[He's confused about how to get back to the prototype from faqs]

#### about verifying online
- OK so I think I have a premium account not sure. Can verify in person and by phone. Need social security or drivers license or passport. I give a copy of my drivers license. 

"What do you think you would have to do to send a secure message to your doctor"
- Sign in. Verify myself. And I'll be doing that on my smartphone. What should i do now? Just reading through. I'm satisfied with that.
- If I'm using my smartphone, I'm going online, not calling in.
- Would pick drivers license. 

"What would you expect if you went through drivers license process?"
- Upload a picture of it. I dont' know if it's back and front, but most use front and back

#### on the info screen - Where did this data come from?
- i think it came from credit file or info on file with the VA. But looks like credit stuff. When I process credit, I see this part here. I've seen this kind of thing before.

#### on Allow screen - what happens if allow
- It would send me to vets.gov and should be recorded or stored if I wanted to do this again. if I had to do this everytime I don't think I would do it.

#### on T&Cs screen - Why seeing this?
- Make sure you agree with everything. Tells you what the site is using your info for. Telling you the terms and conditions. OK so you gotta scroll through. 

#### on Messaging - reflect on process
- Well I signed in and verified my identity. Then agree to terms and conditions. And looks like I am about to message my health care team. 

"With t&cs, what did you agree to?"
- What my info is being used for, what I'm not allowed to do on this site, 

"Anything surprising?"
- No

"Anything challenging?"
- Nah I've done it with other websites. I'm just on a new site, vets.gov. I only use vets.gov to refill prescriptions. so I never knew I could do this other stuff. Very helpful.

"How helpful?"
- I need to get in touch with my primary care doctor and get an appointment. I don't know if I can get an emergency appointment. Can apply for benefits which I need to do also. I need disability and pension. Prescriptions I already know. And my claims. Wonder if I can get education benefits, want to take a couple of classes. 

"With prescriptions refills - do you refill on MHV as well?"
- I'm not sure I've used MHV. I'm not sure which one I've used.

#### on MHV site - doesn't look familiar to him [he's not sure which site he used to refill his prescriptions]

#### back on verify screen - what would you have to do next time when you logged in to vets.gov?
- Hopefully I'd just have to sign in, wouldn't have to verify identity, just sign in.
- If I had to go through that verify every time, I'd just say too much trouble.

"Thoughts on whether it was worth it to go through verify process?"
- For first time, it's worth it. Cause there's a lot of stuff on here that I didn't know I could do. Saves me from thousands of phone calls. And they give you the run around.
- So once we finish this, I'm gonna get right on here (refill prescriptions, message doctor, etc)

"Anything else come to mind,  anything you were surprised about?"
- Nah, it was very helpful. Educational, a lot of things I didn't know I could do. Glad I took the time to do this. Makes a lot of difference. Dealing with VA is hard, I've been using a private doctor 20 miles away. But dealing with private doctor was easier than dealing with the VA at the time.

"Any questions?"
- I just want to say thanks. I really appreciate that. It sure helped me out. Hope others get help from it.
