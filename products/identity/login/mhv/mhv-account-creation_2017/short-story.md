# Veterans' Experience with Vets.gov T&Cs: A Usability Study

## TL;DR

Veterans find the identity verification and Terms & Conditions (T&Cs) acceptance process on vets.gov confusing and burdensome.

## What We Did

Our team conducted remote, moderated usability testing to understand and improve the T&Cs acceptance process for Veterans using vets.gov health tools.

## Key Insights

### Half of the participants struggled with the T&Cs flow.

> "4/8 people completed the T&Cs flow easily, while 4/8 had significant challenges."

### Most Veterans did not read the T&Cs.

> "I typically don't read, but just glance."

### Participants had a general understanding of T&Cs.

> "It's trying to protect the info that is going to be used [on the site]."

### Confusion exists between two-factor authentication and identity verification.

> "Why does vets.gov verify identity? It says it’s a one time process, but we just did that."

### Finding help within the process is not intuitive.

> "It would be nice to have this FAQ info on the [secure your account] page."

## Between the Lines

The study reveals that while Veterans recognize the importance of security measures, the current process does not align with their expectations of simplicity and clarity, leading to frustration and potential disengagement.

## Yes, But

One participant suggested that not all communications require the same level of security, indicating a potential for different levels of verification based on the sensitivity of the information exchanged.

## Why It Matters

Improving the T&Cs acceptance and identity verification process is crucial to enhancing Veterans' online experience, aligning with the VA's goals of providing accessible, user-friendly digital services.

## What’s Next

The next steps include beginning design and development, establishing metrics for T&Cs, collecting feedback, and evaluating the impact of changes after 6 weeks.
