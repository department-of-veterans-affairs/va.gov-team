# May 2017 Rx Tracking and Account Creation 

## Mockups: https://marvelapp.com/8abe5j4 (account creation) and https://marvelapp.com/88agag4 (Rx Tracking)

## Goal for Rx Tracking 
The goal is to validate that with our mockup a Veteran can track their package and understand different parts of the page. 

## Key research questions

Can the Veteran identify where to track their prescription?
Is the information on the page clear?
Can they identify the difference between view history (viewing an old medicine), tracking their package and the prescription details?
Does the Veteran understand what else is in their order?
Does the Veteran know how to find more information about the package? (USPS)
Does the Veteran know what dispense date is? 

# Goal for account creation

The goal is see if Veterans understand and agree to the health terms and conditions on Vets.gov to get access to Rx, SM and BB.

## Key research questions

Does the Veteran accept the terms and conditions?
Does the Veteran understand what tools are available if they accept the terms and conditions? 
Is the information on the page clear?
Do they know why they are being asked to complete terms and conditions? 
Do they know where to find the information/change their answer at a later time? (Profile page) 
What do they think of the experience?

Introduction

Thank you for joining us today. My name is [NAME] and we also have [NAME OF OTHERS OBSERVING] observing and taking notes for this session. We are doing this website feedback session on behalf of the team at the Department of Veterans Affairs working to build a new website that will help veterans get easier access to the benefits they deserve.

The team wants to evaluate a some draft versions of a website today. We want to see what works well, and what doesn’t work well. We're going to show you a website, but it isn't final yet, so if you can tell us what you expect to do on each screen before you do it we can help you through any rough patches.

Before we begin, I’d like to make a few things clear and explain how the session will work.

We aren’t testing your ability. We’re just trying to figure out what works well on the website, and what doesn’t work well. So there are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions and what you think so that we can make the site better. I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.

This entire usability test session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to the next question or task.
We’ll be recording the screen activities as we look at the site. Recording our discussion today will help us capture everything you say accurately.

If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop, and you will still recieve your $25 thank you.

As we're going through the session, I'd like you to think out loud and say what you want to do before doing it.  Also say any thoughts outloud, especially if you find certain things confusing or you aren't sure what to do next. 

Do you have any questions at this stage?
[The moderator will begin audio and screen recording, if using.]

## Warm-up Questions (5 minutes)

To start, I'd like to ask you a few warm-up questions.

Can you tell me a little bit about yourself?
When is the last time you refilled prescription online? 

## Prototype 1: https://marvelapp.com/8abe5j4  

Okay, I'm going to show my screen now and let you drive.

Let's say you heard from a friend that you can now see your prescriptions on vets.gov. You have an account and have logged in and find your self on this page. [open link].  You can see your name for this activity is Brian up at the top.  How would you find a list of your prescriptions? 

[clicks refill prescriptions]

Is that what you thought would happen?

Even though this wasn't what you expected, what do you think about having to do that? 

What page are you on now? 

What is this page for?

What information will you be able to see if you click yes? 

What would you do on this page if I wasn't on the phone with you?

[Does the user read the terms and conditions?]

Would you want to read that information?

Where would you look to read those again?

[Goes to profile page]

How was this experience for you?

## Prototype 2: https://marvelapp.com/88agag4 

Now I'm going to bring us back to this page, [open link].  Let's say you were back on this page and now that you have seen the list of prescriptions you want to go and refill a medicine called tramadol.  How would you do that?

Is that what you expected to see? 

Now that you have clicked refill, how long do you think it would take to this medicine to arrive? 

Let's say you also refilled acitamenophen and you wanted to know when it would arrive?  What would you do next?  

[if they click in process] Did you think that would give you that information? 

What would you do on this page to find out when it is arriving? 

Great, going back a page, was that hard to find information about your package?  

What items are being shipped with acetaminophen?

From this page, if you wanted more information about acetaminophen what would you do?  

Is this what you thought you would see? 

What was the process like? 

Anything else you want to talk about?  This was really helpful.  

## Closing
