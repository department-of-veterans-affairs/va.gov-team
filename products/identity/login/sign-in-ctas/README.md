## POCs

### OCTO teams

This work involves the following teams:

- Identity
- CAIA
- Other VA.gov content/tool owners
- Design system team

## Overview

Currently, individual teams are managing the sign-in and verification CTAs that show on tool content pages. As a result, content and designs have become highly variable across the site, and CAIA has re-written the sign-in and verification CTA content to create consistency. However, codifying and implementing those design/content updates extends beyond the purview of CAIA.

As a result, we are planning on doing the following:

- Going forward, the Identity team will be responsible for managing sign-in related designs across the website.
- Identity will work with CAIA and the design system team to get the updated CTA content and designs into the design system.
- Identity will work with CAIA and tool teams to get the updated designs and content implemented across VA.gov.

## User problem statements

- As a Veteran, I need to be able to easily understand when I need to sign-in to manage my health and benefits, and how to do that.
- As a Veteran, i need to be able to easily understand when, how, and why I need to verify my identity to manage my health and benefits, and how to do that.

## User outcomes

### Desired User Outcomes

- Greater ease and understanding of when users need to sign in or verify their identity, and why.

### Undesired User Outcomes

- Lack of understanding of when, how, or why people need to sign in or verify their identity.

## Business outcomes

### Desired Business Outcomes

- Unify messaging across sign-in/verification CTAs so that they are more consistent.
- Codify sign-in/verification CTAs into the design system so that teams aren't going rogue.
- Create messaging that can be evergreen through the sign-in transition.

### Undesired Business Outcomes

- Teams continue to go rogue, and content and design remain highly variable across the site.

## Measuring success

TBD

## Solution approach

- Danielle to finalize content so that it is evergreen after the sign-in transition.
- Teams involved (Identity, CAIA, Health leads) need to review the content to make sure that no use cases are missing, and that directions are missing.
- Work with design system to get the content into the design system
- Start working with teams to implement content
  - We need to see if we have an audit/list of what pages need to be updated so we can track accordingly.
  - Identity will coordinate this and work with teams over time. Teams will implement their own changes, and identity witll validate that these updates have been made accordingly.

### Key dates

- Spring 2024: CAIA/Danielle rewrote sign-in and verification CTA content and shared with identity.
- June 2024: Samara and Danielle starting to coordinate on sign-in and verification CTA work.
