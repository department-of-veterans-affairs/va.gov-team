## What we're working on:

### Current Team Initiatives


**Sign-in Transition**  
_Current Status:_ Actively in progress
To enhance security and streamline the sign-in process, we are consolidating from four options to two modern, secure credentials: Login.gov and ID.me. The initiative includes updating the sign-in modal to de-emphasize MHV and DS Logon by rearranging options and interstitials to prompt users to make the transition prior to the deprecation date. MHV users will need to transition by January 31, 2025, while DS Logon users have until September 30, 2025, to switch to Login.gov or ID.me.

**Court-Appointed Guardians Issue**  
_Current Status:_ Research & Discovery
Court-appointed guardians access veterans' benefits and information through MHV, but there is no equivalent access pathway through Login.gov or ID.me after MHV credentials are deprecated. We are addressing this gap by exploring short-term solutions to prevent immediate loss of access for guardians, while also considering long-term strategies to support delegate access within the modern credentials.

**Account Creation API**  
_Current Status:_ Actively in progress  
As MHV credentials are set to be retired in January 2025, we are exploring how the MHV Account Creation API can be used to associate MHV accounts with modern VA.gov credentials. The API aims to ensure that users' MHV account information is properly linked within VA systems, with vets-api checking user verification status and station ID before making an asynchronous call to the MHV Account Creation API for account association.
