# Datadog Incident Export Instructions

The OCTO Identity Team is required to report on incidents and outages tracked in Datadog to the VA. This information should be included in sprint reports, which will carry over into the monthly contract reports. Below are instructions on how to export incident information (in CSV format) from Datadog.

1. Log into [Datadog](https://vagov.ddog-gov.com/).  
2. Navigate to the [Incident List](https://vagov.ddog-gov.com/incidents).  
3. In the top-right corner of the Incident List is a dropdown menu listing various date/time ranges. Use this to select the timeframe for the incident information you want.   
4. On the right-hand side of the Incident List (below the search bar) is a button labeled “Export”. Click the button to bring up the incident export menu.  
5. Click on the “Core Properties” and “Time Metrics” checkboxes.  
6. Click on the “Other Properties” tab and then check the “All” box.
