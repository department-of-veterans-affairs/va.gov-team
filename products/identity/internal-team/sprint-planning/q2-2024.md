# Sprint planning priorities: April - June 2024 (Q2)

## 4.25.24 - 5.8.24

Roughly in priority order:

### Identity integration support

- Launch TOU
- Continue to support other in-flight efforts (eg. accredited rep, etc)

### General platform support

- Provide support to VFS teams as needed
- Identity SDK project & CAIA issues
- Wrap support project --  identify metrics to help tell us if we moved the needle
- SLA work

### Removing dependencies work

- SiS Isolation

### Fraud-related support

- Samara to review Charlye's demo presentation and come up with next steps for discussion

~- [Maybe] Run a team meeting to discuss effort and impact of proposed improvements~
  ~- Charlye is presenting on this at demo tomorrow. We may not need further discussion, but we can schedule something if we do.~

### Sign-in user experience

Let's conduct a phase 0 to onboard our team to this portfolio. This work will likely take 1 - 2 sprints. 

Goal: Our team has an understanding of the user-facing sign-in landscape beyond the unified sign-in page.

- Review [Mikki's audit for account creation and sign-in flows](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/login/discovery/account-creation-and-singn-in-flow-audit.pdf)
- Review [latest content updates made by CAIA](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/76785) -- this is for knowledge purposes only. We do not need to offer feedback on their changes.
- Potential idea: If the team feels it would be helpful, I would encourage you to meet with Mikki/Danielle/CAIA folks to talk about issues they've encountered around sign-in flows
- Potential idea: Ask in Slack for other teams' research insights around sign-in (sign-in frustration comes up frequently in research)
- **What else would the team find helpful?**

Roughly in priority order:

### Identity integration support

### Sign-in user experience

- Finish discovery
- If we feel like discovery is done, create Github summary of our findings that outlines key issues.
  - [Here is an example of a generative research report](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/onboarding/discovery-research/2024-03-onboarding-generative-research/findings-summary.md), though what this team creates should be tailored to their discovery and does not need to copy this exactly.

### Sign-in user experience

#### Credential transition

Charles has asked us for the following:

- Mockups of how we can further downplay DS Logon on the sign in page.
- A mockup of an interstitial page for people signing in with DS Logon/MHV to create an ID.me or Login.gov account. **Note**: This likely wouldn't be implemented until later in the transition.
- Please keep in mind:
  - Accessibility -- we should make sure any mockups pass accessibility standards.
  - Content -- please review ideas with Danielle. She has created a robust comms plan for the transition and will have unique context that we should keep in mind. 


#### Sign-in errors

- Exact tasks TBD. We are meeting with the contact center support team on 6/5 to determine how we'll move forward.

(FE's recommendation)
- Verify and update authentication error message documentation on VA.gov ([reference](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Troubleshooting_logging/troubleshooting_signin.md#001---authorization-denied-by-user))
- Document authentication error pages for AccessVA and our CSPs
  - Deliverable(s): Provide documentation along with screenshots of each error code
- Create process for adding new authentication error pages on VA.gov (and elsewhere)
  - Deliverable(s): Governance process/documentation
- Setup meeting with IAM team to determine feasibility of the following:
  - Deliverable(s): Generate error page templates (using HTML, CSS, and VA Design System) with content & troubleshooting steps approved by CAIA?
  - If possible, we should add it to the governance process
