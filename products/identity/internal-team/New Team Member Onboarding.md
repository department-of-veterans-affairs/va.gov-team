# Identity New Team Member Onboarding

# Welcome

Welcome to the VSP Identity Team.  We're excited to have you here!  Please take the time to make a copy of this document so that you can use it for future reference, and in order to complete the checklists below.

## What is Identity?

The [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) Identity team is responsible for many aspects of how we handle users within the [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) ecosystem.  This includes the [Unified Sign-in Page](https://www.va.gov/?next=loginModal), [Sign in Service](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity/Sign-In%20Service), and all other user authentication attributes on [VA.gov](http://va.gov/). When someone asks you what you do on the team, just point them to the sign in button on [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) and tell them you are responsible for ensuring that button and all user authentication attributes are working as best as possible at all times. We are responsible for the login modal page which contains four different login options, as well as many user attribute database lookups from downstream systems. All of our services are hosted within AWS, all of our backend code is written in rails and all of the frontend content is hosted in AWS S3. As you embark on your journey with the team, know that you have a responsibility now to ensure the continued access of over 250k users per day to [VA.gov](http://va.gov/), facilitating access to the benefits they've earned and deserve.
