_NOTE: This refinement was originally done with the thinking that we would be doing a status page as well as the maintenance banners. Upon consultation with our OCTO Product Owner, it was decided to strip out the status page and focus upon just the Maintenance & Downtime banners. This document will reflect that._

## Problem Statement

There is currently inadequate external-facing status ~~pages~~ messages for VA.gov authentication services. This lack of transparency can lead to confusion and frustration for VA.gov users when issues arise. ~~An~~ External-facing status ~~page~~ banner messages would help mitigate these problems by providing real-time updates on the status of these services, leading to clearer communication and better overall service.

### Discussion around the problem statement
- We already have maintenance banners, why not them?
  - We need to confirm all downtimes are displaying correctly on the sign-modal & page.
    - Waiting on CoP FE approval.
    - Riley added ["maintenance_windows"](https://api.va.gov/v0/backend_statuses)
      - PR in Frontend that accompanies this change
  - We can use them, but we need to document our internal process for enabling them.
    - Or automate it.
  - Also, CAIA/Design system error message are not correct for our team.
~~- Statuspage.io is currently a free plan and we don't have much flexibility with it.~~
    ~~- Research possible statuspage.io replacements and decide if we keep status page or develop new~~
      ~~- Where would new be hosted?
        - Must be in an already approved infrastructure
          - k8
          - github
          - statuspage
          - vets-api~~

## Deliverables
- Documented process for publishing downtime/uptime/maintenance
  - What info specifically will this entail?
    - Three types of downtime
      1. Manually set by team when they need to inform users of a problem
      2. Auto set by datadog monitors
      3. Set ahead of time for scheduled maintenance
  - Decision on what we will use to determine if our services are up or down or degraded.
  - Decision on where we are going to host current status and outage messages for va.gov auth services
- Workflow/Process for publishing outage banner alerts or planned maintenance with roles/responsibilities/timelines
  - Through CAIA/Partner teams 
  - Each CSP
  - In general
~~- Status page~~
- Updated content for banner messages to ensure accuracy/consistency
- Alternative methods for Veterans to achieve tasks, if any.
  - Document within the scheduled outage how VA.gov users can perform the same task in an alternate way.
    - Example: making a direct deposit change by calling the Veteran Support Help Desk.
   
## Tasks

### Research 
- Can these be automated?
  - Process for planned outage
  - Process for unplanned outage
  - Issue found by team w/ need to inform & take action
- The current process to display a downtime banner through sitewide/CAIA
- Current Identity response roster & schedule.
- Audit existing banner & alert messages.
  - Work w/ Engineers to update and/or improve messaging to ensure accuracy.
- How the current auto set by datadog monitors is working.
- How the "scheduled through IR bot" maintenance is being displayed on VA.gov.
- Alternate methods for certain tasks users could still accomplish during outage.
~~- Where are we going to host the status page?~~

### Output
- UI which allows a person to manually set "Current outage" message on VA.gov login page
~~- Determine what we want to publish on status page then do it!~~
  ~~- Add service detection mechanisms to status page~~
- Document alternative methods to access benefits if folks can't sign in.
  - This page might be a resource: [Helpful VA phone numbers](https://www.va.gov/resources/helpful-va-phone-numbers/)
  - Add these methods to outage messaging
- Updated Identity response roster & schedule.
~~- Add link to status page within an incident notification (on sign in page)~~
~~- Communicate our status page availability~~
- Make sure all research & documentation is in github
