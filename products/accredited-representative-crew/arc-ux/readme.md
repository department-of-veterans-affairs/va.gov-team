# Accredited Representative Crew - UX Documentation

This folder represents UX documentation for the Accredited Representative Crew products. Documents in this folder represent work that is completed by the design, research, and content teams.


## ARC Design Principles
1. Simple
2. Consistent
3. Accessible

## UX Design Process
The Double Diamond UX process is a design thinking model comprising four phases—Discover, Define, Develop, and Deliver—that visually expands and then narrows the scope of both the problem and solution to encourage user-centered product development. It uses divergent (broad) and convergent (narrow) thinking in the first diamond to fully understand the problem and in the second diamond to explore and then finalize potential solutions. 
 
**Phase 1: The Problem**
* Discover: This is a divergent phase where designers extensively research the problem space, using methods like user interviews, surveys, and observations to identify user needs, pain points, and opportunities. 
* Define: This convergent phase involves synthesizing the gathered data into a clear, actionable problem statement, often in the form of a "How Might We...?" question, to set a focused direction for the design. 

**Phase 2: The Solution**
* Develop: This divergent phase encourages broad ideation, where teams brainstorm and prototype a wide range of potential solutions to the defined problem. 
* Deliver: The final convergent phase involves testing and refining the most promising prototypes with users, leading to the implementation and launch of the best solution. 

**Key Characteristics**
1. Iterative: The process isn't linear; teams can loop back to earlier stages to re-explore or refine ideas as needed. 
1. Divergent & Convergent Thinking: Each diamond alternates between expanding possibilities (divergence) and focusing on a specific outcome (convergence). 
1. User-Centric: The process prioritizes understanding and meeting user needs at every stage, leading to more user-focused products. 
1. Flexibility: The framework is adaptable and can be customized for various design challenges and team needs. 

## ARC Research Process
We will utilize the VA Research guidelines and processes for all research needs.

Representative-facing requires the use of volunteer participants.

## ARC UX Design Briefs
Briefing: For each prioritized initiative, we will create a design brief to support designers. 

This brief should include:
1. Title: The name of the initiative.
1. Goal: What the initiative aims to achieve.
1. Outcome: The desired results or deliverables.
1. Stakeholders: Who is impacted by the initiative?
1. Team: The individuals assigned to work on the initiative.
1. Reporting Methods: How progress will be communicated and monitored.

## ARC UX Documentation Guidelines
* SharePoint - Recordings, Transcripts, PII Data
* GitHub Wiki - Design Rationale, Decisions, Change-log
* Slack Canvas - Temporary space; items should be relocated to the appropriate storage location
* Google Docs are not shareable with OCTO and therefore should not be used for any team-level documentation
* Mural - Flows, Diagrams, Research Analysis, Workshops
