# Estimate Guidance

1	- Very small, low complexity, implementation approach is known  _E.g. small bug fix, text change, minor UI tweak_ \
2 -	Small, straightforward, slightly more comlex than “1” \
3	- Small to medium, a little more complexity or a bit of an unknown \
5	- Medium complexity, some unknowns, likely some design / discussion will be involved \
8	- Moderately large, signficant unknowns or dependencies \
SPIKE - Investigation to guide future work 

Any work larger than 8 points should be broken up into smaller tickets.
