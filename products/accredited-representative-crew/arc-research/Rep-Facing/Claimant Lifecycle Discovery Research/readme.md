# Research Plan: Discovery Research on Claimant Lifecycle for Accredited RepresentativesThe Accredited Representative Crew

Accredited Representative Portal (ARP)

November 2025


### **Background**

The Accredited Representative Portal (ARP) is a VA product designed for representatives, specifically Veteran Service Organizations (VSOs), Attorneys, and Claims Agents, who assist Veterans and their dependents with submitting claims and appeals as well as establishing power of attorney.

ARP is accessible at[ VA.gov/representative](http://va.gov/representative) and requires a[ Login.gov](http://login.gov) or[ ID.me](http://id.me) authentication. It is a modern digital solution designed to expedite the claim submission and establishment process. By reducing administrative tasks, ARP allows representatives to concentrate on delivering a high-quality experience for Veterans, supporting the shared goal between representatives and claimants.

As a team, we have gaps in our knowledge regarding accredited representatives’ experiences with the claimant lifecycle. The Accredited Representative Crew wants to learn more about how representatives manage their caseloads, any pain points and needs, as well as get a better understanding of their daily workflows.

***OCTO-DE Priorities***

Objective 1: VA’s digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.



* Key Result 1: Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.
* Key Result 3: 100% of transactions received via our digital experiences are either processed correctly or we have notified the user of an error.


### **Research Overview**

***Goals***

1. Thoroughly understand the entire claimant lifecycle, from initial contact to completion, specifically as it is experienced by accredited representatives such as VSOs, attorneys, and claims agents.

2. Understand the day-to-day processes used by accredited representatives to manage their caseload work across multiple clients with numerous claims and appeals at various stages of the claims process.

3. Investigate accredited representatives' current workflows, including VA and third-party tools they use, data needs, pain points, and notification/status needs, to identify opportunities for improvement.

***Outcome***



* Gaining insights into accredited representatives workflows, needs, and pain points will help the team better understand where features can be improved, data to make available, and/or supporting those processes previously unknown by the Accredited Representative Crew.
* Enhance the Accredited Representative Crew’s knowledge of the accredited representative user type. This may lead to a more nuanced understanding based on the specific characteristics of Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs), cross accredited VSOs, attorneys, and claims agents.
* These insights, in their entirety, have the potential to influence the information architecture and claimant details functionality of ARP in subsequent iterations.
* The information collected in this study will inform future work, in particular, creating a claim lifecycle diagram that captures a typical representative's workday.

***Research questions***



1. What is the complete claimant lifecycle from the viewpoint of accredited representatives, including their use of both VA and third-party tools to help Veterans and their dependents with claims and appeals?
2. How do accredited representatives navigate the day-to-day triage of multiple clients claims/appeals at varying stages of the claim lifecycle? What factors influence how they decide what to work on next?
3. How do accredited representatives manage their caseloads across multiple clients and lifecycle stages? In what ways, if any, does cross accreditation for representatives change how they manage their caseloads and clients?
4. What pain points do accredited representatives experience in their workflow processes?
5. What features, tools, data, notification/status and technology do representatives need to effectively manage their workflows?
6. How does having access or not to items like a PIV card, VBMS, and/or claims management software shape the claimant lifecycle experience for accredited representatives?


### **Methodology**
