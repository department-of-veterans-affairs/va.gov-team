# Inaccurate and misleading search queries

### Pages are not ranking/appearing in search results even when the query directly matches the page title
- In some cases I do see sibling or even child pages ranking but not the main page itself.
- Examples:
  - A search for “schedule a burial” or “burial schedule” does not return  https://www.cem.va.gov/dailyburialschedule/ (excluding best bet)
  - A search for “cemetery grants” or “cemetery grants program” or “veterans cemetery grants program” does not return  https://www.cem.va.gov/grants/
  - A search for “ptsd treatment does not return  https://www.ptsd.va.gov/understand_tx/tx_basics.asp but does return several sibling pages
  - A search for “ptsd consult” or “ptsd consultation program” does not return  https://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/consult/index.asp but does return sibling and child pages in results
  - A search for “military sexual trauma” does not return  https://www.mentalhealth.va.gov/msthome/index.asp
  - A search for “veterans exposure team” or “vet-home” does not return  https://www.publichealth.va.gov/VET-HOME/index.asp; unable to find any pages in this subdomain in search

### Items ranking in search based on a match of low level page content and displaying that content as a description of the page in search results
- Examples:
  - Search for “foia”, first page of results has 2 “About form” pages that are not FOIA forms.
    - Both pages have an H2 for related forms at the bottom of the page.  In that section there is an H3 with a form number and a link and then an H4 with “Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) or Privacy Act (PA) Request”
    - That H4 is showing as the description for the "About form" pages that are not FOIF forms, they are completely different forms
    - For someone looking for the FOIA form, the appearance of a form number and that description is very misleading
    - Temporary resolution in place: Added best bet for form 20-10206 to draw requests for the FOIA form
    - When and why does search pull content off the page to show as a description instead of the meta description or higher level content.  This could result in any page showing a description that is completely unrelated to the content of the page
