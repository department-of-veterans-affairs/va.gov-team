# Initiative Brief - Search Landing Page

## Outcome Summary

*Write up a brief statement describing the opportunity you're pursuing e.g. "Increase Use of Search Tools on VA.gov." Include the measurable outcome (i.e. metric) you're trying to improve.*

Establish a landing page for search so that any users who search for va.gov/search or any zero result queries that come from redirect pages are presented with a landing page where they can initiate their search query. 

## Problem Statement
*Describe the challenge / pain point you seek to address.:* 
* What is the problem?
	* Currently, the va.gov/search URL is redirecting to the home page which is not an ideal user experience since they are expecting to find a search page. 
* Which Veteran/organizational segments are most affected by the problem?
	* Any VA.gov users (veterans, caregivers, etc. ) who are looking to conduct a search via a search landing page. 
* Where does this problem affect the Veteran journey?
	* When veterans are trying to search for content 
* Why do you think the problem is occurring? Other reasons why this might be occurring?
	* Occurs because there is redirect to the homepage currently because no landing page exists. 
* How does this outcome help achieve a prioritized Crew Objective and further DE's mission and goals?
	* VA North Star " Decrease the time users spend waiting for an outcome."
