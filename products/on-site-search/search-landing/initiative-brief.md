# Initiative Brief - Search Landing Page

## Outcome Summary

Implement a landing page for search so that any users who query for va.gov/search or any zero result queries that come from redirect pages are presented with a landing page where a user can initiate their search query (e.g. no dead ends).

A [Search Landing Page - Comparative Analysis](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17xYNtg4agv-fHwVy2yJojVugRPBLGlZOv9SO4Joz434/edit?usp=sharing) was conducted to understand how other major Websites account for this use case.   The findings:

- Many leading Websites feature a search landing page, utilizing it as it way to assist the user continue their search tasks 
- A search landing page would provide VA.gov with an opportunity to showcase "other search tools/products"
- TBD 

## Problem Statement
*Describe the challenge / pain point you seek to address.:* 
* What is the problem?
	* Currently, the va.gov/search URL is redirecting to the home page which is not an ideal user experience since users are expecting to find a search page. 
* Which Veteran/organizational segments are most affected by the problem?
	* Any VA.gov users (veterans, caregivers, etc. ) who are looking to conduct a search via a search landing page. 
* Where does this problem affect the Veteran journey?
	* When veterans are trying to search for content 
* Why do you think the problem is occurring? Other reasons why this might be occurring?
	* Occurs because there is redirect to the homepage currently because no landing page exists. 
* How does this outcome help achieve a prioritized Crew Objective and further DE's mission and goals?
	* VA North Star " Decrease the time users spend waiting for an outcome."

## Evidence of the problem
 
*Qualitative Data:*
- A search landing page does not currently exist and as a result users are redirected back to the homepage -- a "dead-end" experience.

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
*Which of your product's existing KPIs will you look at to understand if your solution is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about undesired outcomes?*

- Reduced bounce rate for the proposed va.gov/search URL/page
- High click through rate for related links on the proposed va.gov/search URL/page
- High satisfaction score -- via Medallia for the proposed va.gov/search URL/page


#### Baseline KPI Values
*Baseline values for those most critical metrics. These may come from other systems other than VA.gov e.g. eBenefits.*

- TBD

## Assumptions/Risks

**Assumptions**
- Usability: The page will be easy to navigate
- Value: There is measurable Veteran value as we are replacing a dead-end with a "jumping off" point
- Feasibility: This page will be easy to build, requiring no complex technical integration with -- for example -- Search.gov

**Risks**
- This is a low risk effort

## Discovery

- We don't believe an experiment or using testing is necessary.
