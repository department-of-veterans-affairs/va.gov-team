Sync with search.gov team

- Attendees: 
    - Search.gov team - Arantxa Piperova, Dawn McCleskey, Ayush Chakravarty
    - VA.gov team - John Hashimoto, Nick Sullivan

### VA.gov sitemap
- VA.gov sitemap is very basic - it shows what's available on the site
- Change frequency, some information on translations between pages
- All elements of the sitemap have the same `lastmod` date
    - Freshness is a ranking factor - `lastmod` date is assumed to be the date the content was last changed, not just a standard date of when the sitemap was updated
    - Our pages do have a `DC.Date` that reflects an accurate of modified date - we should use that instead. We also have a `Last updated` piece on each page we could use.
    - Seems like the `DC.Date` is showing the same thing across all of the website pages (showing April 30th)
    - **Action item** - Make the `lastmod` date accurate
        - Dawn -> Drupal should offer the ability to offer the ability to mark a page as _not_ indexable

### Subdomains
- Need more thought from VA team on how to do this
- Bunch of microsites listed on the search repo, located in subfolders of www.va.gov (geriatrics)
- Biweekly or monthly, search.gov team could dispatch a crawler and update based on that

- VA.gov includes a unified search experience across many VA subdomains
    - How do we ensure we aren't diluting some of these subdomains? (indexing frequency)

### Click tracking
- Update on that - Ayush - ran into a speedbump, taking longer, developer is preoccupied with ATO process
- 1-2 weeks should wrap up the click tracking
- Some sort of code should be passed over to use to place on our site at `/search`

### Best bets
- Search.gov provided a data dump of top queries for past year
- Can we download all of the best bets from Search.gov into a spreadsheet?
    - Wonky for search.gov to do this from backend
    - Search.gov prioritizing this from other teams
    - This would be text best bets only, not graphics
