## Things to Ponder and jot down: Brainstorming list of items

- Force a recrawl- that is the most tangible thing we need to accomplish right off bat - due to Blue Water Navy veterans...
- Find out how organic search crawls - both search.gov but other sites
- What are performance expectations of search.gov? Example:  Type Ahead
- Are there sub search capabilities - capabilities of file type
- Organic results tracking
- Does search.gov have an automated way for re-submitting an XML site map?
- How to handle all non VA.gov search queries- VAMCS will be coming online how to plan for that?
- What does the blue sky look like for site search?  Any ideas just throw them out there (think North Star)- taking search.gov out of the equation, what is an ideal search experience? Ideas forbest in class search
- Are there linkages to search.govâ€™s product roadmap?

## Next Steps to Kick-off after the new year:

1. Ideas for Best in Class site Search
2. What challenges do we know now, what challenges can we begin to poke holes at?
3. Quick Wins- (Type-Ahead)
