### VA.gov Search - DEPO PO Input Sessions

With veteran user research planned by the new Search & Discovery product team in January,  we seek the “domain” perspective – via Mural guided session -- of DEPO Product Owners.   For example:

- From your domain perspective, how is on-site search supportive of your goals and veterans' experience?
- What are the specific audience (personas/tasks) needs?
- If there were no constraints, what would be the ideal VA.gov search experience?

Please sign up for one of the three planned guided conversations in December.  (Note: Each session is limited to **8 participants** to ensure appropriate time to capture thinking of all.) We will set a fourth session in early January -- if needed -- to accommodate schedules and demand.  

Outlook calendar invites will be sent to participants.
