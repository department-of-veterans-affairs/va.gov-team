With the goal of understanding and framing the problems to be solved, an upfront discovery process will be conducted, while some approved activities (e.g. type-ahead for onsite search) will be pursued as prioritized.   This "state of the state" process will include the following tasks:

- [x] Set-up Google Search Console and Bing Web Developer Tools to analyze trends, site health, etc.
- [ ] Conduct scan of available data sources -- including Search.gov (on-site) and SEMRush, GSC, Bing (off-site) to surface key trends and insights to help with problem framing.
- [ ] Review foundational components of VA.gov search -- e.g., sitemap xml, sub-domain indexing, site audit/health -- to determine if updates, fixes, enhancments are needed to improve search optimization.
- [ ] Talk to key stakeholders to gather information, data and observations on the VA.gov experience from key domain perspectives 
- [ ] Determine in collabortion with Design/Research if [qualitative research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/design/vsa-research-process.md) -- e.g., user interviews or usability testing -- is needed to better establish the problem space.
