# Overview of Research Plans for VA.gov Search Improvements

## Goals
1. What product & team are you doing this research for?

Search enhancements for VA.gov, Public Websites

2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?

   Since the release of the modernized VA.gov in November 2018, there has been no dedicated focus to optimize VA.gov's search experience. Analytics tells that search is a primary utility for the modernized VA.gov's users - from June 2019 to June 2020, ~10% of visitors used site search, and ~46% of site visitors come to VA.gov via organic search.
   
    We'd like to better understand Veteran's needs and expectations around our site search so we can improve our search experience, and more fully align with our North Star goals.

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?
    - **What are veterans/caregivers searching for?** 
    - **In what scenarios do users use site search?**
      - Do users see where they can use search? Or is the hidden input box make it harder to find and to utilize?
      - Does the search button being disabled by default present any usability issues?
    - **What, if any, pain points do users experience when using search?**
      - How do those pain points differ across devices e.g. mobile, desktop, screen readers, etc.
    - **How effective is VA.gov's search tool at providing the information people are seeking?** 
        - Effective in terms of relevant results?
        - Effective in terms of ability for users to locate those results? (the way it is presented?)
      - How can search results be improved to improve scanning behavior?
      - How do users scan search results?
      - Is there a cognitive disconnect and/or issues caused by differing typography (smaller font) on the search results page compared to the rest of the site?
      - Do people understand the difference between “top recommendations” and the rest of the results and what are their thoughts on that?
      - What, if any, advanced search features do users expect? (refinements, type ahead, etc)
    - **Other VA.gov search utilities**
      - Do people utilize or see “More VA search tools”? (get some data on the right rail)
      - Do users know about other search utilities - find a facility, yellow ribbon
      - How is the search experience different for users across benefit hubs?
    - **Where do users look for information if they don't find it via VA.gov search?**
      - How do users see VA.gov search separate from Google?

4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research?
    - Veterans/Caregivers will experience the following pain points which will lead to Veterans/Caregivers perceiving our site search to be ineffective:
      - Too many results to sort through
      - The information they're looking for will not be immediately apparent from the search titles and descriptions
      - Not having a way to refine search results
      - Users will go to a search engine or decide to engage with a person if they don't find what they're looking for via site search.
    - Users will expect filtering functionality on search results.
    - Users will use site search immediately when coming to VA.gov with a task in mind, especially if they have not completed that task recently (or ever).
    - Users use Google and online groups (such as Facebook or Reddit) for broader queries, and they come to VA.gov with more specific information in mind found through those other avenues.
    - Users likely won't pay attention to the label Top Recommendations; if they do, they won't understand it means.
    - Benefits that have a clear associated task, such as disability (filing a claim) are easier to navigate via search than education or another benefit that has multiple, or less clear, outcomes.
    - The way our search engine works is not up to people's expectations.

     

## Method
- What method of research are you planning and why?
   - Analytics review to get a better sense of what users are searching for and how effective search is
   - On-site survey to gain a better understanding of how users rate their search experience, whether they are having trouble finding anything, and what they are having trouble finding
   - Social listening: observing what users on Reddit.com/r/veterans and Hadit.com were looking for (Possibly utilizing Rallypoint.com’s message boards to solicit additional feedback)
   - Comparative analysis to review how other sites utilize on-site search, allow users to filter results
   - User interviews, so that we can further clarify what users need and expect from search
- Where are you planning to do your research?
   - Analytics data will be available on DOMO dashboard, Google Analytics, and Search.gov
   - On-site survey will be implemented using Medallia
   - Social listening via Reddit, Hadit.com, and Rallypoint
   - Comparative analysis on similar resource-heavy sites and case studies of on-site search improvements
   - User interviews will be remote moderated sessions via Zoom
