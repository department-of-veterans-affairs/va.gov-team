## Description

Published in 2018, ***Top Tasks: How to identify, measure and improve customer top tasks*** is a methodology -- developed as a result of 15 years of research and practice --  for prioritizing what matters most to customers. The Top Tasks framework of creating a prioritized and defensible list of top customer tasks and building your customer experience with the list as a guide, has been implemented by some of the world's largest organizations: Microsoft, Google, IBM, Toyota and the European Union.

## How Does It Work

Top Tasks is designed to be an ongoing management model for managing the customer experience.   The framework at a high level consists of:

- **Top tasks identification** - collecting a list of all possible tasks a customer may want to complete and refining the list until is it between 50 and 100 tasks.  This initial capture and refinement comes through a series of internal discovery and analysis, stakeholder input and alignment and voting.  
- **Customer architecture design** - getting in the region of 400 customers to vote on the list and choose their top tasks.  Then, creating a task league table from the results from the top tasks (the top vote getters) to the tiny tasks (the least voted for).
- **Task Performance Indicator (TPI)** - is about giving you reliable, defensible success and time metrics for customer top tasks.  It allows you to say: "This task has a 40% failure rate and even those who succeed in completing it are taking four times too long to complete it."  The goal is to continuosly measure and improve the performance of top tasks.

## Why Do It

In sum, Top Tasks management allows you to:

- Clearly identify the top and tiny tasks your customers are seeking to complete (via their mental model, their search behaviors, how they navigate the sight, how they pick through content, etc.)
- Design an intuitive classification for your customers
- Accurately measure completion rates and times for top tasks (VA.gov tracks a slice of this now via the Monthly Product Health MVP reports)
- Identify the causes of task failure and slow completion times
- Make changes
- Measure again -- e.g. did the changes work?
- Continously measure and improve, measure and improve, measure and improve those customer top tasks.
