### Search Analytics for UX

### Patterns

Are top results relevant? Top five search results are divided into [sections](https://www.flickr.com/photos/rosenfeldmedia/5690405825/): 

-   Relevant (ranking is completely relevant to search term)

-   Near (not a perfect match but reasonable for it to be a top result)

-   Misplaced (shouldn't be high up on the page)

-   Irrelevant (no apparent relevance to the query)

Relevance ratings: He did this in three separate ways: strict, loose, and permissive:

Strict: Only results ranked as relevant were acceptable (r).

Loose: Both relevant and near results were counted (r+n).

Permissive: Relevant, near, and misplaced results were counted (r+n+m).

So, the query "reserve room," by strict definition, scored a 40%---two of the five results were rated an "r." 

By loose definition, it scored an 80%. (Four of the five results were rated "r" or "n.") And by permissive definition, it scored a 100%. (None of the results were rated an "i") You can see how all the results fared in [Figure 4-5](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rosenfeldmedia/5690405795/).

[Time based](https://www.flickr.com/photos/rosenfeldmedia/5690981020/) patterns: example: "Free Thanksgiving meal" "are u open thanksgiving", "can I visit my Dad grave on Thanksgiving in a National Cemetery?" (holiday hours are not listed on location pages)

What type of questions do they have? What [answers](https://www.flickr.com/photos/rosenfeldmedia/5690405311/) are they looking for?

Long tail searches - less search traffic, but will usually have a higher conversion value, as they are more specific

Look for outliers

### Failure Analysis: 

Is the best match near the top of the page?

(Click data) Are results being clicked on at a healthy rate?

Search terms with large search exits (not always a bad thing)

-   Locations (maybe they only need an address or phone number and do not click on the location's individual page)

-   Forms (users are downloading forms and leaving and that is counted as a search exit)

### Track Empty Search Results

Currently not being tracked, Sam is adding tracking.

Suggestion: Add helpful links on the empty search results page, such as "popular searches"

Hypothesis: Once [webspelling_correction](https://open.gsa.gov/api/searchgov-results/#webspelling_correction) is added to search, empty search results will decrease.

### Search Refinements

Ideas for links to add to add best bets

### Audience Analysis

What can be tracked? IP address? Logged in/out?

Segment your audience: logged in | not logged in

Geography: Most users are from Texas

### Goal-based Analysis

Ideas of what to track:

-   Session analysis- is this possible?

-   % of queries that retrieve 0 results

-   % of queries where users click on result

-   % of queries that lead to users exit site 

-   % of users that use search

-   Average # of queries per session

-   Average # of search result pages viewed per query

-   Average # of pages viewed per query

-   Average time spent on site after searching

-   Average time spent on site before searching

-   Average time spent on each search results page

-   Session duration for all sessions that included search

-   Search refinement rate 

-   Most frequent search terms

-   Most frequent pages on the site where site search was initiated

-   Total # of unique searches
