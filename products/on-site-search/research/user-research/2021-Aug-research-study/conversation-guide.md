## Intro - 5 minutes

Thank you for joining us today! My name is Cindy, and I have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about finding VA information online.

Before we start, I want to go over a few things:

- **This session should take about 30 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you any longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or task.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express. 
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording to the cloud.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 


## Screen sharing instructions (if needed later)
*COPY REVISED INSTRUCTIONS FROM PDF CONVO GUIDE*
- In the Zoom application on your phone or computer, you'll see a few buttons at the bottom. In the middle is a green button that says Share (phone) or Share Screen (computer). If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.

- Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the green button that says Share. A menu should come up with options of what to share. Please hit "Screen".
  - *(on a phone)* You will be asked to select what you'd like to share. Please select "Screen" and then "Start now". If you see any additional prompts please read them aloud and I will help.
  - Great, now I can see your screen! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.

- *Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:*
  - Ok, it seems like we're having trouble sharing your screen, so I'm going to share my screen with you and give you control of it. Does that sound ok? *[Share your screen]*. Can you confirm if you can see my screen? *[Give mouse control]* Can you click and see if you can move your mouse around on my screen?


## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Let’s start with a few questions...
- Where do you typically go to get information and benefits from the VA?

(Google / Facebook / MHV / eBenefits / Contact center call or email / VA.gov / ________________________)

- *If they mentioned VA.gov*, ASK: When was the last time that you remember going to the VA.gov website?

## Screen sharing
I would like you to share your screen with me so I can watch you using a prototype that I'm going to share. I'll need to see only a blank web browser window for now.
*(refer to Screen sharing instructions above, if needed)*

What kind of device are you using today? *(Phone / Computer)*

## Veteran Tasks
I would like you to look at a prototype that I will share with you. This is a demo tool that may not function the way you expect. Some parts of the screen will work, and some will not. Before you click/tap anywhere on the screen, I would like you to tell me what you want to do, and I may ask you questions about that, before telling you to go ahead and try it.

I will share the link to the prototype in the Zoom chat. *COPY LINK TO CHAT* Do you see the link? 
- *If don't see chat, ASK:* Do you see the red "Stop Share" button? If so, put your mouse just above it and see if you see more Zoom controls. Then click on the Chat button in the center of the Zoom controls. NEED TO ADD MORE INSTRUCTIONS HERE

While you're looking at this prototype, I would like you to *talk aloud* as much as possible so that you share what you're thinking, what you're doing, what you like, what you dislike, and what you're unsure about. 

### Task 1: [Submit letter in support of your claim - Form 21-4138] - 5 minutes
Let's say that in order to support your request for VA benefits, you want to submit a letter from someone who has first-hand knowledge of your condition or injury.

Have you ever done this before? (Y / N) If so, how did you do this? If not, how might you do this?

Can you look at the page in your web browser and tell me what you might do--but don't do it yet.

- *RECORD where wanted to click/tap: Search in header / Can't find what looking for / VA forms / Other________________________* 

What would you expect to happen?

Now go ahead and try it.

Before you do anything on this page, what do you think you can do here? 

Now you can go ahead with what you wanted to do.

- *RECORD search query typed:* _____________________________

Because this is a limited prototype, you're going to see what happens if you typed something slightly different from what you typed--"XYZ".

*If see search results, ASK:* What are your impressions of what you see?

What would you do now?
 
## (if time) Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes
*Type into #feedback-backchannel: "Any questions you want me to ask?"*
- What did you *like* about what you've seen today?
- What did you *dislike* about what you've seen today?
- What would you like to *change* about what you've seen today?
- Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you think I should know? 


## Thank You and Closing - 1 minute

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on improving the VA website.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
