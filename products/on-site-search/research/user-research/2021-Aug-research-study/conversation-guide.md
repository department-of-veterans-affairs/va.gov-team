## Intro - 5 minutes

Thank you for joining us today! My name is Cindy, and I have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about finding VA information online. You won't need to log in during this session.

Before we start, I want to go over a few things:

- **This session may take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you any longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or task.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express. 
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- I will be sharing a web page link with you during the session. **How would you prefer to receive the URL?** 
  - I could dictate it to you, put it in the Zoom chat, email it to you, *(only if on a phone)* text it to you.
    - *(if email)* Is your current email XYX *(get from participant roster)* ?
    - *(if text)* What is your mobile phone number?
    
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording to the cloud.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 


## Screen sharing instructions (if needed)
- In the Zoom application on your phone or computer, you'll see a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a green button that says Share (phone) or Share Screen (computer). 
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
  - (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared)

- Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the green button that says Share. You will then see options for what to share. Please choose "Screen" or  your web browser.
  - *(on a phone)* You will be asked to select what you'd like to share. Please choose "Screen" and then "Start now". If you see any additional prompts please read them aloud and I will help.
  - Great, now I can see your screen! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.

- iPad: Broadcast screen

- *Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:*
  - Ok, it seems like we're having trouble sharing your screen, so I'm going to share my screen with you and give you control of it. Does that sound ok? *[Share your screen]*. Can you confirm if you can see my screen? *[Give mouse control]* Can you click and see if you can move your mouse around on my screen?

## Instructions for finding Zoom chat (if needed)
- In the Zoom application on your phone or computer, you'll see a row of buttons at the bottom. 
  - Computer: Just to the left of center is a conversation bubble that says Chat. 
    - *If don't see chat, ASK:* Do you see the red "Stop Share" button? If so, put your mouse just above it and see if you see more Zoom controls. Then click on the Chat button in the center of the Zoom controls.
  - Phone: On the far right is a More button or 3 dots. Tap that and then on Chat or the conversation bubble. 
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.


## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

*NOTE how to share URL: dictate / Zoom chat / email / text* 

Let’s start with a few questions...
- Where do you typically go to get information about VA benefits?

(Google / Facebook / MHV / eBenefits / Contact center call or email / VA.gov / ________________________)

- *If they mentioned VA.gov*, ASK: When was the last time that you remember going to the VA.gov website?
  - What were you looking for?
  - Where did you look?
  - Did you find what you were looking for?

## Screen sharing
I would like you to share your screen with me so I can watch you use a specific website. I'll need to see your web browser. If you want to share your whole desktop, first close any other applications that you don't want me to see.
*(refer to Screen sharing instructions above, if needed)*

What kind of device are you using today? *(Phone / Computer)*

## Veteran Tasks
I would like you to look at a prototype that I will share with you. This is a demo tool that may not function the way you expect. Some parts of the screen will work, and some will not. There may be multiple ways to do tasks on this website, and sometimes I may ask you to try a different way if the way you try doesn't work in the prototype.

Before you click/tap anywhere on the screen, I would like you to tell me what you want to do, and I may ask you questions about that, before telling you to go ahead and try it.

I'll have you start from a website that I'm going to (spell/put into the Zoom chat/email/text) for you to click on (desktop https://bit.ly/tasks-d or mobile https://bit.ly/tasks-m). *(If asked, reassure that this is a legitimate link to what I want you to test.)*

Do you see the link? 

While you're looking at this prototype, I would like you to *talk aloud* as much as possible so that you share what you're thinking, what you're doing, what you like, what you dislike, and what you're unsure about. 

### Task 1: [Submit letter in support of your claim - Form 21-4138] - 5 minutes
Could you please click on the link for "Task 1"?

Let's say that in order to support your request for VA benefits, you plan to submit a letter from someone who has first-hand knowledge of your condition. You want to find the form for them to write the letter to support your claim.

Have you ever done this before? *(Y / N)* If so, how did you do this? 

Can you look at the page in your web browser and tell me what you might do--but don't do it yet. What would you expect to happen?

- *RECORD where wanted to click/tap: Search in header / Can't find what looking for / VA forms / VA Benefits and Health Care / Top 4 boxes / __________* 

Now go ahead and try it.

- *RECORD any reactions to the search landing page, esp. if got there from Search in header*

Before you do anything on this page, what do you think you can do here? 

Now you can go ahead with what you wanted to do.

- *RECORD where clicked on search landing page: search box / Find a VA Form / Resources and support / Find VA Locations / More search tools:*

- *RECORD search query typed:* _____________________________

Because this is a limited prototype, you'll see what happens if you typed something slightly different from what you typed--"letter in support".

- *If see search results, ASK:* What are your impressions of what you see?

What would you do now?

- *If participant isn't scrolling, SAY:* You can scroll in the prototype, if you want to.

What would you do now?

- *RECORD if participant gets stuck w/o finding link to target content*

 
### Task 3: [College credit for military service] - 5 minutes

Now I would like you to see if you can get any college credit for your military service.

Have you ever done this before? (Y / N) If so, how did you do this?
