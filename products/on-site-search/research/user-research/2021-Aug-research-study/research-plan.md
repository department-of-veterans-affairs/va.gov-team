# Research Plan: Search Design Concepts
 	
## Goals	
The purpose of this research is to get user feedback on new design concepts for surfacing site search and other search tools. We plan to test the following design concepts:
1. A new search landing page that has links to other search tools (Find a Form, Resources & Support, and Find a VA Location)
1. A new link on the VA.gov home page under the "top 4" boxes that goes to the new search landing page
1. Search in the header is a link that goes to the new search landing page
1. New links at the bottom of the search results page go to other search tools

Research findings (including how many participants clicked on which links) will be used to recommend which of the above design concepts might be helpful to users going forward, before we do more design exploration. The intent is to assess *utility* (was it helpful to users and prevented them from getting stuck?) and *usability* (was it findable and intuitive?) for each of the above design concepts.

In 3-6 months or after some or all of the design concepts have been launched, we should look at the analytics and assess the actual usage of the new links.

## Background
User research findings from the VA.gov home page ([May 2021](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding/research-report.md) and [
Feb 2021](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/on-site-search/research/user-research/research-study-jan-2021/research-findings.md)) have indicated that users get stuck while working on tasks because they're so focused on the "top 4" boxes, and that site search and other search tools are not noticed and used as much as we hoped. To address this, the Search & Discovery team is considering new ideas for better surfacing site search and other search tools.

## Research questions
1. Do users find and use the other search tools?
1. What are users' reactions to a landing page that highlights search tools? 
1. Do users try using the search tools from links on the landing page?  
1. What are users' reactions to Search in the header taking them to a landing page?
1. Do users try the new search link under the "top 4" boxes? What are users' reactions to it taking them to a landing page?
1. Do users notice the search tool links at the bottom of the search results page? Do they try using them? Reactions?
1. Are users able to complete tasks without getting stuck?

## Hypotheses
1. A search *landing* page that highlights other search tools will result in more users using the search tools and finding what they're looking for.
1. A search *results* page that highlights other search tools will result in more users using the search tools and finding what they're looking for.
1. New search link(s) near the "top 4" boxes will result in more users finding what they're looking for.

## Method--Overview
We will conduct remote moderated research sessions via Zoom. Participants will be given tasks to do using a design prototype; ideally, some will be on desktop and some will be on mobile.

## Method--Details
### Screens in the design prototype:
![screen-flow-diagram](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/on-site-search/research/user-research/2021-Aug-research-study/images/Screen%20Flow%20Diagram%20for%20Search%20Prototype.jpg)

### Search tasks (that are not in the "top 4" boxes) for the design prototype:
1. In order to support your request for VA benefits, you want to submit a letter from someone who has first-hand knowledge of your condition or injury. (search for **"letter in support"** in site search or Find a form; this is top forms search #4--for form 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim)
1. Find out if there is a VA hospital in Knoxville, Tennessee (search for **"Knoxville TN"** in site search or go to Find a VA location)
1. See if you can get college credit for your military service (search for **"college credit"** in site search or Resources & Support; this finds R&S article "How do I get college credits for my military service?")

**Notes:**
- In the prototypes, site search will lead only to *unhelpful* search results (as it does today for the above search tasks, which is why they were selected). We want to see what participants do (on the page they're looking at and/or navigating back to the home page) and see if they find that *searching from one of the other search tools leads to success*.
- We have *a separate prototype for each task* so that search queries and search results can be different.

## Participants and Recruitment	
Ask Perigean to recruit **15** Veterans in order to get **8** completed sessions using the following criteria:

### Must have for participants
- All are Veterans
- At least 7 people who plan to use their computer for the session
- At least 7 people who plan to use their smartphone for the session
- At least 3 participants 55 or older
- At least 2 people with a cognitive disability (e.g., TBI)

### Good to have for participants
- At least 2 people of color
- At least 1 woman
- At least 1 participant 35 or under
- At least 2 people who don't have any degree or vocational training after high school (to include enlisted Veterans)
- At least 1 person that has a college degree (to include officer Veterans)
- At least 2 people who live in a rural or remote area
- At least 1 person who lives in a major metropolitan area
- At least 1 non-native English speaker

### Recruitment requirements for ALL participants
- Have a computer or smartphone and be willing to be complete their interview on one of those devices (NOT a tablet)
- During the session, be willing to share a new web browser window on their device 
- Have a working microphone on their device
- Have Zoom downloaded to their device prior to the session and know how to share their screen

### Additional questions to ask in the screener
- What kind of device will you be joining on and are willing to share a browser window on--computer or smartphone?
