- **Takeaway**: The fact that search pulls in results outside of VA.gov causes some confusion:
>  Sometimes the, the search functions, they're, they're kind of wonky as far as the, the answers that it provides. And I, I can't remember whether it's this particular search function that that's in this website or others, but it seems like some of 'em search within the website and then sometimes it searches exterior so and so stuff will start showing up that that's not actually in VA gov. And I don't know whether there's a algorithm in place for this and where it keeps the search within the, the website or not. But I would say for those that where you can search initially within the website and then if you want to expand the search elsewhere, you know, having an opportunity to do it as opposed to just initially, you know, putting out all this information or, or going across these spectrums.
