This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.

**The goal of this document is:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data

## Research Questions & Answers
1.  -   **In what scenarios do users use site search?**
        -   Do users see where they can use search? Or is the hidden input box make it harder to find and to utilize?
            -   Participants almost always immediately went to look for information by using the dropdown navigation of clicking links on the homepage first.
        -   Does the search button being disabled by default present any usability issues?
            -   No, but not having the input field activated after clicking the "Search" caused issues for at least one participant.
    -   **What, if any, pain points do users experience when using search?**
        -   Not finding relevant results
        -   If a participant did not see a relevant result quickly/high up on the page, they would usually give up.
        -   Military jargon that is hard to understand for those who have not been in the military in many years.
        -   While looking for information in the past, participants had issues with being taken back and forth between eBenefits and VA.gov.
        -   Technical problems on iOS, search results on Find a Facility, Find a Form and Global Search would not load on staging. Search results only appeared after moderator asked them to refresh the page.
        
    -   **How effective is VA.gov's search tool at providing the information people are seeking?**
        -   Effective in terms of relevant results?
            -   Not effective unless it was a common topic and was typed 'correctly' (Ex: participants needed to type '10-10ez', adding a space or adding 'va form' to the search term made it impossible to find). Participant's ability to find what they were looking for on the search results was positively impacted by "Top Recommendations".
        -   Effective in terms of ability for users to locate those results? (the way it is presented?)
            -   One participant commented that it "looks just like Google, so it is easy". Most users focused on keywords within the title of a search result to determine whether or not it was relevant. 
        -   How can search results be improved to improve scanning behavior?
            -   Increase hierarchy and font size. Utilize VA.gov's design system to better match the rest of VA.gov.
        -   How do users scan search results?
            -   They look at only the first few results.
        -   Is there a cognitive disconnect and/or issues caused by differing typography (smaller font) on the search results page compared to the rest of the site?
             -   One participant commented that the print was really small.

        -   Do people understand the difference between “top recommendations” and the rest of the results and what are their thoughts on that?
               -   One stated it was "what VA recommends", another stated it is "what people use the most". If a Top Recommendation was shown, the participant usually clicked on a link under it. 

        -   What, if any, advanced search features do users expect? (refinements, type ahead, etc)
            -   Six out of ten would prefer filters. Most participants did not click on a type ahead suggestion on VA.gov. One participant, while on Google.com, commented that they liked that they didn't have to type the whole word out. 
    -   **Other VA.gov search utilities**
        -   Do people utilize or see “More VA search tools”? (get some data on the right rail)
            -   Very rarely because it wasn't usually shown, even on desktop. Media queries are currently set up so that the right rail is only shown directly to the right of the results if the participant's browser width was fully expanded. Otherwise, the right rail shows up at the bottom of the page and participants usually never scrolled down that far.
        -   Do users know about other search utilities - find a facility, yellow ribbon
            -   Most participants found Find a Facility due to it's placement on the header. Participants had more trouble finding Find a Form and usually utilized global search to look for a form.
        -   How is the search experience different for users across benefit hubs?
            -   In their past experience, participants with healthcare related questions were looking at eBenefits first. 
    -   **Where do users look for information if they don't find it via VA.gov search?**
           -   Many looked for information on eBenefits. Participants also utilize Google and sites found via Google. A few mention Veteran Facebook communities and Reddit. 
        -   How do users see VA.gov search separate from Google?
             -   One participant commented that they trust pages on VA.gov moreso than results on Google.
2.  Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research?
    
    -   Veterans will experience the following pain points which will lead to veterans perceiving our site search to be ineffective:
        -   Too many results to sort through
            -   True, a few participants commented on '999 results'.
        -   The information they're looking for will not be immediately apparent from the search titles and descriptions
            -   Participants were more likely to read the title than the description. They often selected a result based on a keyword mentioned in the title. 
        -   Not having a way to refine search results
            -   If a participant did not find what they were looking for after their first attempt at searching, they often rephrased their search term.
    -   Users will go to a search engine or decide to engage with a person if they don't find what they're looking for via site search.
            -   Only one participant mentioned calling after not finding a form. 
    -   Users will expect filtering functionality on search results.
            - Six mentioned wanting filters only after being asked about it.
    -   Users will use site search immediately when coming to VA.gov with a task in mind, especially if they have not completed that task recently (or ever).
            - False, participants seemed to go immediately to browsing the navigation or homepage links first.
    -   Users use Google and online groups (such as Facebook or Reddit) for broader queries, and they come to VA.gov with more specific information in mind found through those other avenues.
           - True, many also mentioned looking on eBenefits.
    -   Users likely won't pay attention to the label Top Recommendations; if they do, they won't understand it means.
        -   Several participants pointed it out. One stated it was "what VA recommends", another stated it is "what people use the most". If a Top Recommendation was shown, the participant usually clicked on a link under it. 
    -   Benefits that have a clear associated task, such as disability (filing a claim) are easier to navigate via search than education or another benefit that has multiple, or less clear, outcomes.
        -   No noticeable difference between benefit hubs. 
    -   Users will have difficulty locating information on other search features (ex: Find a Facility).
        -   Participants were more likely to find a local VA facility using Find a Facility than global search. Participants were less likely to find a form on Find a Form unless they typed it exactly the way Find a Form expected.
    -   The way our search engine works is not up to people's expectations.
        -   Participants were frustrated when what they searched for was not the top result or not listed on the results page at all.
