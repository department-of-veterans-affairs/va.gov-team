## **1. Storage & NLP/Deep Context Cost Estimates**

| **Scenario**                          | **Documents Indexed** | **Storage (GB)** | **Ingest VCUs** | **Search VCUs** | **ML VCUs** | **Estimated Monthly Cost** | **Estimated Annual Cost** |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Full Indexing (Benefits Claims)**   | 117,000,000           | 840              | 20              | 15              | 10          | $3,544                     | $42,524                   |
| **5-Year Subset**                     | 4,200,000             | 30               | 2               | 2               | 1           | $354                       | $4,248                    |
| **1-Year Subset**                     | 840,000               | 6                | 1               | 1               | 0.5         | $88                        | $1,056                    |
| **Unauthenticated Search (Sitewide)** | 500,000               | 3.75             | 0.5             | 0.5             | 0.25        | $44                        | $528                      |
| **Unauthenticated Search (Other)**    | 1,881                 | 0.015            | 0.05            | 0.05            | 0.025       | Negligible                 | Negligible                |

**Notes:**

- **Storage**: Includes primary content, semantic embeddings, snapshots, and metadata. Elastic Cloud pricing is based on serverless deployment ([elastic.co](https://www.elastic.co/pricing/serverless-search)).
- **VCUs**: Ingest, search, and ML VCUs are allocated based on content size, indexing complexity, and NLP/vector processing needs.
- **ML VCUs**: Used for NLP inference and semantic/vector search via Elastic’s Inference API and models such as ELSER ([elastic.co](https://www.elastic.co/docs/explore-analyze/machine-learning/nlp/ml-nlp-elser)).
- **Incremental Costs**: Smaller datasets share base infrastructure; incremental costs are proportionally lower once the full cluster is provisioned.

## **2. Query Capacity Estimates**

| **Category**               | **Average Query Volume**                                          | **VCUs Needed** | **Elastic Cloud Capacity Notes**                                                     |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Unauthenticated Search** | ~2,035,738 queries/month → ~1.1 QPS (95% traffic 07:00–23:59 EST) | 0.5–1           | Serverless search automatically scales; fractional VCUs sufficient for small subsets |
| **Authenticated Search**   | Full index (117M docs) → 1.1 QPS                                  | 15              | Includes semantic/vector search; scaling handles NLP inference load                  |

**Notes:**

- **VCUs**: Elastic Cloud uses Virtual Compute Units (VCUs) to manage CPU, RAM, and disk allocation for search, ingest, and ML inference workloads.
- **Semantic Search & NLP**: Deep content understanding and natural language queries increase VCU requirements for search and ML workloads ([elastic.co](https://www.elastic.co/docs/solutions/search/semantic-search)).

## **3. Cost Reduction Strategies**

1. **Storage & Semantic Search Control**

   - **Index only high-value content**: Focus NLP/vector indexing on documents most likely to be queried (e.g., recent claims).
   - **Tiered Storage**: Use hot/warm/cold tiers to reduce costs while keeping NLP active for frequently queried content.
   - **Example**: Reducing from full 117M claims → 1-year subset drops monthly cost from ~$3,544 → ~$88.

2. **Query & NLP Management**

   - **Optimize query patterns**: Batch NLP inference or precompute embeddings for frequent queries.
   - **Scale VCUs dynamically**: Serverless deployment allows automatic scaling based on query load, avoiding overprovisioning.

3. **Hybrid Approach**

   - **Combine full-text indexing with semantic/vector layers**: Maintain keyword search for less-frequently accessed documents and semantic search for high-value content.

## **4. Summary Observations**

- **Primary Cost Drivers**: NLP inference (ML VCUs) and ingest pipelines for semantic/vector embeddings dominate costs in Elastic Cloud.
- **Full Index with NLP & Semantic Search**: ~$3,544/month, including 117M documents, 10 ML VCUs, and 15 search VCUs.
- **Indexing Smaller Subsets**: 1-year or 5-year subsets reduce monthly costs dramatically (~$88–$354/month).
- **Query Load Management**: Serverless Elastic Cloud auto-scales to handle 1.1 QPS; VCUs are provisioned dynamically for NLP workloads.
- **Cost Optimization Levers**: Limit NLP/vector indexing to high-value content, employ tiered storage, batch inference, and leverage serverless scaling.
