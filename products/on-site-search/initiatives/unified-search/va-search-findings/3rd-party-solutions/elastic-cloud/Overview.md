## **Elasticsearch** is an open-source, distributed search and analytics engine designed for full-text search, structured data querying, and real-time analytics. It enables organizations to index large volumes of content and provides features like faceted filtering, highlighting, and search-as-you-type suggestions. **Elastic Cloud** adds fully managed infrastructure, automatic scaling, security, and support for NLP and semantic search capabilities.

---

📌 **1. Comprehensive Search Coverage of Authenticated Content**
Elastic Cloud supports document- and field-level security (DLS/FLS), enabling restriction of access to specific documents or fields per user role. Integration with identity providers (Okta, LDAP, SAML) is supported, with role mappings enforcing user-context filtering.

> “Document level security (DLS) enables you to restrict access to certain documents in search queries and aggregations. Field level security (FLS) enables you to restrict access to certain fields in documents.”
> 🔗 [https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/document-level-security.html](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/document-level-security.html)

**Additional Context:**
Unlike Kendra, which ingests ACLs automatically, Elastic Cloud requires explicit configuration for role mappings or middleware to enforce query-level filtering. DLS/FLS applies to both full-text and vector-based search results.

---

📌 **2. Faceted Filtering**
Elasticsearch supports hierarchical faceted search using [Aggregations](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations.html).

> “Aggregations provide aggregated data based on a search query. They help you analyze trends and patterns, and can be nested to create hierarchical facets.”
> 🔗 [https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations.html](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations.html)

**Additional Context:**
Elastic Cloud fully supports nested/hierarchical facets. Front-end display must be implemented by developers, unlike Kendra, which provides built-in hierarchical facet UIs.

---

📌 **3. Deep Content Search (Full-Text + Semantic Search)**
Elastic Cloud combines standard full-text search with NLP and semantic search capabilities. Text extraction is handled via the [Ingest Attachment Processor](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/plugins/current/ingest-attachment.html), while semantic search leverages embeddings through the [Inference Processor](https://www.elastic.co/docs/explore-analyze/machine-learning/nlp) or pre-trained models like [ELSER](https://www.elastic.co/docs/explore-analyze/machine-learning/nlp/ml-nlp-elser).

> “The ingest attachment processor lets Elasticsearch extract file attachments in common formats (such as PPT, XLS, PDF, and DOC) using the Apache Tika library.”
> 🔗 [https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/plugins/current/ingest-attachment.html](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/plugins/current/ingest-attachment.html)

**Additional Context:**

- Custom analyzers may be configured for domain-specific tokenization, stemming, and synonym handling ([elastic.co](https://www.elastic.co/docs/manage-data/data-store/text-analysis/create-custom-analyzer)).
- NLP/vector processing incurs ML VCU costs; deep context search uses embeddings to support semantic similarity queries.
- Unlike Kendra, developers must configure pipelines for ingestion, semantic indexing, and NLP inference.

---

📌 **4. Result Contextualization**
Elastic Cloud provides highlighting for query matches and allows integration of vector/semantic search results to display contextually relevant snippets.

> “The highlighter can be used to highlight search terms in the query in the text fields of the documents. It uses the Lucene highlighter under the hood.”
> 🔗 [https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-highlighting.html](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-highlighting.html)

**Additional Context:**

- Direct answer extraction requires combining semantic search with an LLM or retrieval pipeline.
- Highlighting applies to both full-text and fields returned from vector search queries.

---

📌 **5. Predictive Search Assistance**
Elastic Cloud supports [Suggesters](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-suggesters.html) for autocomplete, query suggestions, and spelling correction. For context-aware suggestions, the Inference API or embedding-based search can enhance relevance.

> “Suggesters provide search-as-you-type functionality, autocomplete, and spelling correction suggestions.”
> 🔗 [https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-suggesters.html](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-suggesters.html)

**Additional Context:**

- Keyword-based suggesters are native; NLP-driven suggestions require Elastic’s ML/Inference API or custom embedding pipelines.
- Serverless deployment auto-scales compute resources to handle predictive search workloads.

---

📌 6. NLP & Semantic Search Costs
Elastic Cloud’s NLP and semantic search functionality incurs additional ML VCU usage for embedding generation, inference pipelines, and semantic/vector processing. Costs scale with document volume, query load, and the complexity of NLP workflows. Monthly totals are approximate due to serverless dynamic scaling.

> “Elastic Cloud’s serverless ML VCUs handle inference and embeddings for semantic search, scaling automatically with workload.”

| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **ML & Semantic Search**     | Embedding generation, Inference API, vector processing; scales with document volume and query load. | [Elastic Semantic Search Docs](https://www.elastic.co/docs/solutions/search/semantic-search)                      | High                |
| **Compute Resources (VCUs)** | Ingest and search VCUs, including CPU/RAM/disk for indexing, full-text search, and query handling.  | [Elastic Cloud Pricing](https://www.elastic.co/pricing/serverless-search)                                         | High–Medium         |
| **Storage**                  | Primary content, semantic embeddings, snapshots, and metadata; tiered (hot/warm/cold).              | [Elastic Storage Considerations](https://www.elastic.co/pricing/serverless-search)                                | Medium              |
| **Snapshots**                | Backups increase storage usage and cost.                                                            | [Elastic Snapshots](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/snapshots-take-snapshot.html) | Medium–Low          |
| **API Calls**                | High-volume query or ML inference requests increase compute usage.                                  | [Elastic API Considerations](https://www.elastic.co/docs/solutions/search/semantic-search)                        | Low–Medium          |
| **Data Transfer**            | Outbound traffic may incur costs; inbound typically free.                                           | [Elastic Data Transfer](https://pulse.support/kb/elastic-cloud-pricing-guide)                                     | Low                 |

**Cost Context:**

- Full NLP + semantic search deployments are higher than keyword-only setups due to ML VCUs for embeddings and inference.
- Elastic Cloud generally remains more cost-efficient than Kendra for VA.gov-scale workloads (~42K/year estimated for 117M documents with NLP & semantic search).
- Costs scale with **document count, semantic/vector indexing, NLP inference, and query volume**.
