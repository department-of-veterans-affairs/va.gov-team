# Initiative brief: Unified search solution

## Outcome Summary
Site visitors can utilize a single search experience to find the information they need regardless of where the information is stored - general web content, facility location data, forms database, authenticated or personal information.

- [On-site search product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/on-site-search/product-outline.md)

## Problem
We currently have multiple search solutions in place across various experiences on VA.gov. These independent solutions not only require visitors to know where to go on the site to search for specific types of information, they also are not meeting expectations in the relevancy of results returned. 


## Desired User Outcomes
- Creates a unified search that allows site visitors to execute a search for any type of information - facility locations, authenticated information, forms, general information, etc. - from a single search experience
- Improved findability of content currently not served up in global search
- Improved relevancy and accuracy of results

## Undesired User Outcomes
- 

## Desired Business Outcomes

- Reduce development and maintenance overhead due to multiple search code bases and experiences
- Mitigates risks from dependency on other government agencies with unknown priorities

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Reliance on a managed search solution that is no longer supported

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
> ðŸ’¡ *VA.gov products measure success against Ease of use, Service Completion, Trust/Satisfaction, Health.*<sup>1</sup>\
> ðŸ’¡ *Identify balancing metrics to ensure you're not bringing about undesired outcomes.*

- Product KPI | Baseline | Target | Link to data source (e.g. GA, Domo)

## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks
> *Identify risks related to usability, value to users, feasibility/implementation, and viability given organizational constraints<sup>2</sup>. 
> Indicate how you'll validate/test against these risks. Inspired by [SVPG's Four Big Risks](https://www.svpg.com/four-big-risks/).*

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - .
- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - .
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
  - Examples:
    - Upstream/Downstream API/Data availability and reliability
    - Site performance impacts (see [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse), [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/), #-daily-lighthouse-scan)
  
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - Examples: 
    - VA stakeholder testing, marketing, compliance requirements
