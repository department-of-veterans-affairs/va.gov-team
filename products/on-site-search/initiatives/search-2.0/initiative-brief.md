# Search 2.0


## The Problem

Since the release of the modernized VA.gov in November 2018, there has been no dedicated focus to optimize VA.gov's search experience -- both off-site (organic) and on-site -- to the benefit of our unique users.  And yet, search is a primary utility/tool for the modernized VA.gov's users-- e.g., more than 40% of daily site visitors (*validate) are referred by search engines and more than 10% of daily visitors (*validate) use site search.  

Clearly, providing an authoritative, reliable and modern off-site and on-site experience for Veterans fully aligns with our North Star goals of:

- Increase the use of self-service tools, focusing on services most important to Veterans.
- Decrease the time users spend waiting for an outcome.
- Consistently deliver a satisfying, reliable, and secure online experience.
- Be the single source of truth of Veterans-related health and benefits content for service-members.

### Research & Discovery

To understand how effectively our off-site and on-site search offerings address the needs of our audience, we are compiling up-front data from these primary data sources:

Onsite:
- Search.gov (note: VA.gov's original API-based implementation of the Search.gov utility did not include click-tracking; a javascript code snippet is in development by the Search.gov product team with expected delivery by July 2020.)
- Google Analytics

Offsite:
- SEMRush
- Google Search Console & Bing Web Developers Tools

In addition, qualitative research -- such as interviews and usability tests -- will likely be necessary to provide a more in-depth understanding of the individual users’ or user group’s experiences, motivations and intent.

### User Goals

**For On-Site Search**

As a user, I want to:

- Easily and quickly find the information I need with few clicks as possible on the VA.gov Website.
- Avoid reading long pages of content in order to get to my desired outcome.
- Get the most relevant results when I use VA.gov search.
- Get the most relevant results even if I am not precise about the information I seek or make a mistake in my search terms.

**For Off-site Search**

- As I veteran, I want to easily and quickly find the link to the information I need with few clicks as possible using a search engine.

### Business Goals

**For On-Site Search**

- Veterans using the VA.gov site should be able to find what they need with few clicks as possible using the search tool/utility.

**For Off-site Search**

- Veterans should be provided with search engine links to the most authoritative and up-to-date information available on the VA.gov Website.


## Assumptions

**On-Site Search**

- Search.gov will continue to be the search engine of choice for VA.gov

**Off-Site Search**

- The organic search authority and ranking of VA.gov is not as strong as could be to ensure the site is the single source of truth for veterans.


## Questions

- Given resource constraints, a determination needs to be made about the scope and prioritization of this initiative.  Clear objectives and outcomes need to be communicated to ensure aligment with key stakeholders -- including VA business line leads and DEPO leadership.
