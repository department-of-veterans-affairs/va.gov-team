# Research plan for Ask VA: Submit an inquiry

Ask VA Integration Team, July 2023

Last updated by @tygindraux: July 19, 2023

## Background

Ask VA (AVA) is an online portal that allows Veterans, caregivers and others to submit questions to VA and receive a secure response.

Currently, AVA resides within a stand-alone Microsoft portal that is inconsistent with VA design standards, is not mobile-friendly, and has accessibility issues. 

We need to move AVA to VA.gov. It should be mobile friendly, accessible and easy to submit an issue and receive updates and information that results in a final resolution. Ultimately, we want AVA to feel part of a cohesive and user-centered approach to support.

This [product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/products/Ask-VA-MVP-1-Product-Outline.md) includes more details about our MVP scope.

### OCTO priorities

This research supports the following OCTO priorities:

* Solidify the VA.gov platform
* Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience

### Veteran journey

Ask VA can support Veterans, caregivers and other submitters at all stages of the Veteran journey, from starting up to aging.

## Research goals

The key goals of this study are to:

* Understand how submitters expect to answer form fields and in which order
* Understand if submitters are clear when they need or don't need to authenticate
* Understand how submitters expect to review an ongoing or past inquiry

### Outcome

This research will help us determine if and how we need to improve the design and content of this current iteration of the form and dashboard.

### Research questions

Understand how submitters expect to answer fields and in which order:

* Do the form patterns match people’s expectations of how they would answer each question?
* Are people missing information on any question, page or sequence of pages?
* Are there too many or too few fields per page?
* Is it clear how much longer the form is?
* Do people understand how to edit their answers on the review page?
* How long do people expect it to take to submit an inquiry?
* What do people expect to happen right after they submit an inquiry?

Understand if submitters are clear when they need or don't need to authenticate:

* Is it clear when you need to authenticate or when it’s optional?

Understand how submitters expect to review an ongoing or past inquiry:

* What information do people need about the status of an inquiry?
* When do people decide to review inquiries? For example, when they get an email notification or when they're logged into their account for another reason?
* How often do people expect to be updated about changes to the status of their inquiry?
* What do submitters expect to happen after they receive a response to their inquiry? Do they expect to reply back? If they can’t reply back, what would they do?
* What information do people need when they review a past (solved) inquiry?

### Hypotheses

1. Most people will think authentication is required in order to ask any question, or, they will not understand that it’s required for specific types of fields.
2. Most people will find answering fields throughout the form straightforward and intuitive.
3. Most people will choose to answer fields even if they are not required.
4. Most people will have a clear understanding of how long the form is and how much progress they have made throughout the process.
5. Some people will give up midway through the form because there are too many fields.
6. Most people will understand how to edit answers on the review page.
7. Some people will be confused about which information they can edit on the review page and which they cannot.
8. Most people will prefer to receive email notifications when the status of their ongoing inquiry changes.
9. When reviewing an ongoing inquiry, most people will need to know which date they submitted their inquiry, what their question was and its current status (in progress or closed).
10. Once they receive a VA response to their inquiry, some people will expect to reply back.
11. If people aren’t able to reply back to an inquiry, some people will submit a new inquiry as a way of continuing the conversation or following up.
12. Some people will expect an estimate or deadline for when they will receive a response from the VA.

## Methodology

This will be a moderated usability study conducted remotely on Zoom. We'll use a Sketch prototype to observe users (hypothetically) authenticate and ask a health related question.

## Recruitment	

Before defining our recruitment strategy, we reviewed:

* [Perigean recruitment guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recruiting-participants)
* [Introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md)
* [Inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md)
* [Recruitment checker for equality](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing)
 
### Recruitment approach

We will use Perigean to recruit Veterans and their dependents. We request a kick-off call with Perigean before recruitment can start.

We've submitted a [Recruitment Request:Name of study](url goes here).

### Recruitment criteria

We need to recruit 16 Veterans for this study in order to achieve 10 completed sessions.

#### Primary criteria

**All participants:**

* Must have contacted VA online or over the phone in the last 3-6 months
* Must have signed into VA.gov in the last 3-6 months
* Must have a smartphone which they are willing to use for the session and can use Zoom (and share screen) on

#### Participant groups

There are two primary groups we would like to recruit for this study.

**Group 1: Veterans**

* At least 8 people who are Veterans

Example: I’m a Veteran. I called the VA to ask them a question about my claim status last month. I sign in to VA.gov every month to renew my prescriptions. I can use Zoom on my smartphone.

**Group 2: Dependents**

* At least 8 people who are dependents of Veterans
    * At least 4 (and a maximum of 8) people should be dependents of a Veteran who has multiple dependents.
    * A maximum of 4 people should be dependents of a Veteran who only has one (them) dependent.

Example: My wife is a Veteran, I’m one of her dependents. She has another dependent, my son. I called the VA 2 weeks ago to ask them a question about my son’s benefits. I sign in to VA.gov twice a year to check my records. I can use Zoom on my smartphone.

#### Demographic targets 

We recognize that it's unlikely Perigean can meet all of these targets when recruiting. We would like to use these as targets:

* At least 8 people should be over 55
* At least 5 people should have a cognitive disability or consideration
* At least 5 people should identify as Black, Hispanic or Native
* At least 5 people should live in a remote or rural area
* At least 4 people should be without a degree or professional certificate
* At least 3 people should have a partial hearing loss
* At least 3 people should be of immigrant origin
* At least 2 people should identify as other than male
* At least 2 people should identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender

### Screener questions

We expect Perigean to screen for all criteria listed above. We have written specific screener questions to include alongside existing screener questions Perigean already has:

* Are you a Veteran?
     * Yes
     * No
* Are you the dependent of a Veteran? Note: A dependent is often the spouse or unmarried child of a Veteran.
     * Yes
     * No
* If you are a dependent, does the Veteran for whom you are a dependent also have other dependents?
     * Yes, I am one of multiple dependents
     * No, I am their only dependent
* Have you contacted the VA online or over the phone in the last 3 months?
     * Yes
     * No
* Have you signed in to VA.gov in the last 3 months?
     * Yes
     * No
* Are you enrolled in VA health care?
     * Yes
     * No
* Do you ever find it difficult to read or understand information? Note: Even if you have not been diagnosed with a cognitive disorder, such as dementia or PTSD, you may still answer yes to this question based on your experiences.
     * Yes
     * No
* Do you have a partial hearing loss?
     * Yes
     * No
* Do you have a smartphone that you can use to join your session? Note: You should be able to join Zoom from your phone.
     * Yes
     * No

## Future research

We have removed a few things that are out of scope for this study. In future research, we’d like to learn:

* Is it clear how information has been pre-populated from My VA Profile?
* How does the process differ for submitters who submit both personal and business queries, such as School Certifying Officials?
* How does the unauthenticated experience differ from the authenticated experience?

And we’d like to observe submitters:

* reply to an inquiry from their dashboard and their email
* look up an inquiry (from the start page) using their reference number
* go through the form using assistive technology
