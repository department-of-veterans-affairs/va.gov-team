## Intro (5 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Tyler]. How are you?

I’m a researcher from VA. I work on improving VA.gov so it's easier for Veterans to contact VA online if they have a question.

**What I hope to do today** is get a sense of how we can make this process better.

**What I don't want to do** is add to any frustration that may have led you to contact VA - or even frustration you've had with actually contacting VA - in the past. I want to be up front and say that I don't have a way of fixing those past experiences. But, I do want to know about your frustrations in case they're things we can improve in the future.

So before we get started, when Perigean set up this session, they asked if you’re okay with a couple of observers joining us. This helps my team members learn from our conversation as well, and they also help me take notes so we capture everything you share.

**I want to confirm now, are you okay with a couple of my teammates joining us to observe?**

- `IF NO` Use Slack to let observers know.
- `IF YES` They're in the waiting room, so I'm going to let them into the meeting now.

> Let in observers from the waiting room.

Welcome. Can everyone say hello? This is `PARTICIPANT`.

**Thanks everyone, now I’ll ask you to turn off your cameras and mute yourselves for the rest of the session.**

There are a few other things I want to mention before we start:

- **This session should take about an hour.** I’ll make sure we finish on time, so I may occasionally move us along during the session, so we can cover everything.
- **We’re here to learn your honest opinions.** Negative feedback is helpful too, because it helps us learn how we can improve.
- **I also want to make it clear that we’re not testing your ability.** So, for example, if I ask if you understand something, it’s because I want to make sure writing is clear.
- **I’m going to share a prototype with you today.** This is like a test version of the website, so it may not work exactly how you expect. For example, you’ll be able to click some buttons, but not all of them.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, you just have to let me know.** And that might be a pause to get some water or to stop the session completely. You'll be paid even if we don't complete the full session.
- Last thing is about recordings. We can record the session to help us confirm we captured your opinions accurately and sometimes share video clips with our colleagues at VA. If we do this, we don’t link anything you share in the session to any information that could identify you. We remove your face and your name from the videos. **Knowing this, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
  - `IF NO` Don't record
  - `IF YES` Once I start recording, I’ll confirm again.

> Start recording: `RECORD TO CLOUD`.

I’ve started recording. I'd like to confirm again: **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?**

## Warm up (5 minutes)

Alright, it sounds like we’re ready to get started. I'd like to begin by learning more about your experience with VA and our online services.

- How long have you been a Veteran?
- How often do you go online to use VA services, like, schedule a medical appointment or check your benefits?
- Have you ever contacted VA online or over the phone?
  - `IF NO`
    - Why might you contact VA?
    - If you were going to contact VA, would you prefer to call, go online or get in touch another way?
  - `IF YES`
    - Can you tell me about a time when you contacted VA?
    - How do you usually contact VA? Why?
      - `IF ONLINE` Did you use your phone, tablet or computer?
    - How was the support you received?

**Key things to note:**

- Why do they choose to contact VA (instead of elsewhere, or another task)?
- How do they decide which channel to use when they contact VA?

## Start page (5 minutes)

Thanks, it’s helpful to learn about your experience with VA.

Next, I’d like to share some ideas to get your feedback.

In the Zoom chat, I'm going to send you a link to a prototype. I mentioned earlier a prototype is like a test version of a website. It might not work perfectly, but this way we can learn what we need to improve before we share it with more Veterans.

> Send link in Zoom chat.

- Can you please open the link in the chat?
- Have you shared your screen on Zoom before?
  - `IF YES` Great. Can you please share your screen?
  - `IF NO` I’ll walk you through how to do that…

Thanks! Now I’m able to see your screen too.

> Screen: Start page

Okay, now that we have this open, we’re not going to click on anything yet. 

First, I'll give you a second to read the page more closely.

- Can you tell me what you notice first on this page?
- What is this page about?

For the rest of our conversation, I’d like you to imagine that you need to ask VA a question. Let's say it's a question about a recent experience you had at a VA medical center.

- What would you do first if you wanted to ask a question about an experience you had at a VA medical center?
  - Can you tell me, without clicking anything yet?
  - Where would you click?
  - Why would you click `Sign in` (or) `Continue without signing in`?
- Does it seem like you need to sign in, in order to start?
  - What if your question was about education benefits?
- Are there any (other) benefits of signing in?
- How long would you expect it to take to ask a question?
- What do you expect to happen when we click `Continue without signing in`?

Let’s go ahead and click `Continue without signing in`.

**Key things to note:**

- Where are they most likely to click first?
- Is it clear when they need to sign in or when it is optional?
- Are the benefits of signing in (besides when it’s required) clear?
- Is the purpose of Ask VA clear at this point?

  - Why would you choose `Health care` or [whatever they choose]?
- Before we click anything else, why do you think the VA is asking you this question?
- How important do you think it is to answer this question correctly?
- How long do you think this process is going to take?
- Before we move on, what do you expect to see on the next page?

- Do they notice a difference between this page (topic) and the previous (category)?
- Is it clear you can only choose 1 option?
- Do they choose `Getting care at a local VA medical center` without being prompted?

> Screen: What’s your question about?

Before we click on anything, I’ll remind you that you’re asking a question about a recent experience at a VA medical center.

  - What do they think [option they didn’t choose] means?
  - Can you imagine contacting VA about [option they didn’t choose]?

- Do you have any hesitation about typing your question into this box?
- Is there any other information that you expect to share with the VA?

So, with this prototype, we can’t actually type anything into the box. Instead, we’re going to click `inside the box`, and we’ll pretend like you typed in your question.

**Key things to notice:**
- Do they have any hesitation about typing in their question?
- Is there any surprise or frustration with how long it’s taken to get to this question?

> Screen: Tell us about yourself [Empty]

- First, can you summarize this page for me?

We’re not going to fill in your information. For today, we’re just going to go through this page, and I’d like you to tell me how you’d answer the question. You don’t actually need to tell me your personal information, I’m more focused on how you would put in your information.

So, for example, I might say, “I’d start by typing my first name in this box.” And so on.

- What would you do first?
- And in this next field?
- (Continue until bottom of the page - Gender)
- Why do you think VA needs this information?
- Is there any information on this page that you would not like to give VA?
- Is there any other information that you expect to share with VA?

(If it’s not mentioned yet) I noticed that it asks for a social security number or service number.

- What does that mean?
- Does that mean you would share both your social security number and service number?

- Is there anything that could be easier?
- Did anything surprise you?

- What did you appreciate about the experience?

Thanks again for sharing your time with me. It’s been so helpful to learn from you.

- Do you have any questions for me?

Okay, well thank you so much for the time.

Perigean will send you a thank you note with some information that you can pass along to other Veterans if they’d like to participate in future research sessions. 

I hope you have a lovely rest of the day.

## Pause or exit strategies

We can use this strategies to prepare for difficult situations.

### If the participant isn't feeling well

I'm sorry you're [not feeling well]. Do you feel up for continuing? You'll be paid even if we stop early.

> If they choose to continue...

Okay, just let me know if you change your mind.

### If the participant is showing signs of upset or distress

This sounds so hard. Would you like to take a break or stop?

> If they choose to take a break and come back...

Welcome back. I'm interested to hear more about [topic you left off on]. Are you up for continuing or would you prefer we move to the next topic?

### If the participant decides to stop

Thank you for your time today, I completely understand your decision to stop.

> If they seem distressed...

Before you go, the VA Hotline number is 988, it's a confidential helpline, and it's 24/7. It's up to you whether you call.

### If the participant is fine to continue, but you aren't

I hear that you're okay to continue. Before we do, I realized that I need a minute. I'm going to turn off my camera and microphone, and get a glass of water. Is that okay with you? I'll be back in 3 minutes.

> If you're still not able to continue, after you pause...

Thanks for letting me take a break. You didn't do anything wrong, but I'm realizing that I'm not going to be able to continue this session. You will still be paid for the full time. I really appreciate you sharing with me today. Is it okay with you if we stop? Thanks very much.
