## Transcript - NEED TO CLEAN UP

Tyler: Alright, so just confirming one more time. Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio?

3
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:19.769
Tyler: Okay, thanks so much, [P12], so I know that was a little bit of a headache for the last 20 min or so for you. So I really appreciate you. Kind of pushing through and getting set up

4
00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:30.910
Tyler:  before we get started with the prototype. I'd I'd love to just learn a little bit more about you and your experience with the Va. How long have you been a veteran?

5
00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:35.379
> P12: Since 1990,

6
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:51.230
Tyler: since 1,990? Okay, cool. So been a veteran since 98. Did you start interacting with the Va. Right after you got out of service, or just in the last couple of years?

7
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.840
> P12: No, it was. It was later, a few years later.

8
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.389
Tyler: And now are you? How are you interacting with the Va. Are you enrolled in healthcare or

9
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.769
> P12: right? Fairly regularly. Yes. And then I'm involved in health care, too.

10
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.709
Tyler: Okay. have you ever contacted the Va.

11
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:15.260
> P12: Yes.

12
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:22.299
Tyler: How do you usually contact the Va, do you call them? Or email, or another way?

13
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:30.669
> P12:  I've done. I've done both I'm on phone. And I I've also messaged them through

14
00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:31.979
> P12: through the app

15
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.630
> P12: where you can. Your provider.

16
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.919
> P12: I guess, for the care.

17
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:48.600
> P12: I'm also calling to find out when  yeah.

18
00:01:48.900 --> 00:02:01.769
Tyler: okay, cool. So a couple of different ways that you're interacting with the Va. And one of those is through the mobile app sounds like you're often contacting them. Maybe about healthcare appointments. Things like that.

19
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.529
Tyler:  is this the Va mobile app?

20
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.120
> P12: Yes.

21
00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:22.809
Tyler: awesome. Okay. Well, that's really helpful. Just to get an idea of your interactions with the Va in the past. So today, we're gonna ask you some questions and look through this prototype together. So we can get your feedback

22
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:33.850
Tyler: so the next thing we need to do is set you up with this prototype on your phone. Okay? So what's gonna happen is, I'm gonna send you a link to a prototype in the the chat.

23
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:49.350
Tyler:  if we're finding that it's kind of a struggle with the Internet connection, we can. We can do it differently. So you'll just let me know. So I'm gonna send this link, and it's gonna show up on your phone and you can go ahead and click that link when it pops up.

24
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.629
Tyler: Okay, okay? So you click the link.

25
00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.080
> P12: Yeah, yeah.

26
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.739
Tyler: Can you say that one more time?

27
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.010
> P12: It it says you are chatting as a guest.

28
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.410
Tyler: Okay?

29
00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.810
> P12: Could never do I close that or just.

30
00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.079
Tyler: I think you can close that. I'm not sure what that message is

31
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.709
Tyler: all right. So

32
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.439
Tyler: have you opened the link? It should it should look like,

33
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.449
Tyler: it says a Va website.

34
00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:29.560
Tyler: Yeah.

35
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:37.170
Tyler: okay, cool. So now, what we're gonna do is we're gonna have you share your screen. So you're gonna come back to zoom.

36
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.430
Tyler: If you can come back to the zoom app on your phone

37
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.590
Tyler: and then tell me when you're back at the Zoom app.

38
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:01.570
> P12: Okay.

39
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.640
Tyler: okay, so you're back on Zoom.

40
00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.599
Tyler: Okay. So

41
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.269
Tyler: have you shared your screen on your phone before.

42
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.419
> P12:  I don't think I'm my phone. But yeah.

43
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:26.929
Tyler: okay, no worries. That's that's common. It's gonna either. There's gonna be a button, either at the top or at the bottom of your zoom window, depending on your phone. And it's gonna say, share

44
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.730
Tyler: screen or start broadcast something like that.

45
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.709
Tyler: Do you see a button that says that?

46
00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.470
> P12: Yeah, we got

47
00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:47.080
Tyler: okay, cool. So once you see that we're gonna try and share screen. And I'm gonna let you know when I can see your screen.

48
00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:57.130
> P12: Okay? But then it's asking me, like Microsoft, onedrive Microsoft sharepoint Google on this other. Oh, okay. Oh.

49
00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.790
> P12: screen. Okay, well, start recording or testing with zoom

50
00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:10.449
Tyler: perfect. Yeah, if we click on that. And then what's gonna happen is I'm gonna be able to see your zoom window. so I'll let you know when I can see that.

51
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:38.220
Tyler: Okay, cool. So now, [P12], I can see your your screen. So I'm seeing exactly what you're seeing.

52
00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:43.360
Tyler: If you go ahead and navigate to your perfect now I can see. Ask. Va.

53
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.329
Tyler: can you still hear me? Okay.

54
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.669
Tyler: can you still hear me, [P12].

55
00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:05.059
Tyler:  Can you hear me, [P12]?

56
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.260
Tyler: I'm not able to hear you.

57
00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.830
Tyler: I wonder if you went on mute.

58
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.869
Tyler: It looks like you're not on mute.

59
00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:55.880
Tyler: can you?

60
00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:01.289
Tyler: You say, can you say something one more time?

61
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:24.669
Tyler: Oh, you can hear me. Okay, but I can't hear you. Okay, that's helpful. So

62
00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:29.969
Tyler:  Why don't you? Let's go back to

63
00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.610
Tyler: Why don't we click?

64
00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:38.030
Tyler: I'm not sure actually where you click. But let's go back and stop sharing our screen, because that seems to have made it

65
00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:45.149
Tyler: stop working the audio. so I still can't hear you, but I know you can hear me.

66
00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:48.909
Tyler:  So if we go to the zoom window.

67
00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:58.139
Tyler: And then if you if you scroll over next to reactions, it's a red button.

68
00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:03.479
Tyler: Yeah, and let's just click, stop share. Let's see if that changes anything.

69
00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.149
Tyler: Can I hear you now?

70
00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.250
Tyler: No, it looks like I'm still not able to hear you.

71
00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:14.880
Tyler: Oh.

72
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:19.750
Tyler: I'm feeling really bad at the moment, because I know you've done a lot of troubleshooting.

73
00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:25.680
Tyler:  Let's think

74
00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:38.200
Tyler: the only thing I can think [P12] is. I still can't hear you. I'm hoping you can hear me is maybe if you left the Zoom Meeting and you rejoined, maybe your audio will pick back up

75
00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:42.740
Tyler:  Do you want to get that a try.

76
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:45.780
Tyler: Okay.

77
00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:12.099
Tyler: Hi, [P12].

78
00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.690
Tyler: okay, can you? See?

79
00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.450
Tyler: Yes, I can hear you.

80
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:33.700
Tyler: Yeah, that was kinda weird. Yeah, yeah. I'm so sorry. I feel really bad. You've had to like get through so many different hurdles. So what we're gonna do instead is I'm gonna share on my screen. And you're just gonna see what I can see. Okay.

81
00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:36.000
Tyler: I think that might work better.

82
00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:39.829
Tyler: So I'm just getting myself set up

83
00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:43.750
Tyler: and let me know when you can see my screen.

84
00:09:44.120 --> 00:10:05.269
Tyler: Okay, cool. So we're looking at what you were just looking at. So I'm gonna kinda be your your fingers, and so together, we're gonna look through this prototype now, and I'll ask you some questions. Okay, we might go a little bit more quickly, or I might skip some questions just because I don't want to take up too much of your time, and I know we spend a lot of time already setting ourselves up.

85
00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:06.920
Tyler: So

86
00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:10.310
Tyler: we're looking at this first page here, and

87
00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:13.210
Tyler: tell me what you're noticing. As we look at this

88
00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:26.080
> P12: I can see, it says, like to sign in signing is required education benefits. If it's the questions about education benefit. So

89
00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:27.470
> P12: it's so weird.

90
00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:32.879
Tyler: right? Okay? And I'll keep scrolling. Just so you can see a little bit more.

91
00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:39.760
Tyler: And what? What would someone come to this page to do?

92
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:47.420
> P12: Yes, if it was about your education benefits work study or debt.

93
00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:52.280
Tyler: I guess education.  okay.

94
00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.520
Tyler: So it feels like it's a place where you could maybe ask something about education.

95
00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:04.830
Tyler: Awesome. So for the rest of our conversation today, we're gonna pretend, like you need to ask the Va a question.

96
00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:13.749
Tyler: We're gonna say that you're noticing you have some problems with your hearing, and you wanna ask the Va, how to get your hearing checked.

97
00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:19.789
Tyler: So you don't know how to get your hearing checked. And you've come here because you're like, how do I? How do I start?

98
00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:27.769
Tyler: So what would you do first? And you can tell me to scroll down or to to click?

99
00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:31.099
> P12: Yeah, I guess I would scroll down to. I saw something on health

100
00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:35.250
Tyler: like reading that first page, I'm thinking, like this part only deals with

101
00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:39.090
> P12: questions about like the Gi bill stuff like that

102
00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:40.410
Tyler: right?

103
00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:42.460
Tyler: Okay, that makes sense.

104
00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:50.150
Tyler: So we would be looking for something that says health cause. It feels like this is just for education. I can totally see that

105
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.210
Tyler: awesome. Does it feel like you need to sign in? You mentioned signing in

106
00:11:55.580 --> 00:12:02.449
> P12: well, it's it. Does that that first part. You showed me it just pretty much says to sign in.

107
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:11.490
> P12: Yeah, it seems like, only if it's gonna be about education, dead or or something else, do you wanna scroll back up to it.

108
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:19.530
> P12: yeah. See? Right there to me. That's like, the only reason I would be on this page is if my question was about education.

109
00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:21.040
Tyler: right benefits

110
00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:30.509
Tyler: coming here for my house, I'd be like I must have to go to a different page or something

111
00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:50.110
Tyler: that's really helpful feedback. I can totally see why this feels like it's just for education. And and you would leave the page and maybe go somewhere else. That makes a lot of sense. So this is actually for more than just asking about education, which obviously, we need to work on on making that more

112
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:52.260
> P12: reward it because

113
00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.270
> P12: kind of like.

114
00:12:54.490 --> 00:13:05.699
Tyler: if your question is about education, maybe even a comma after education, you know, education cop benefits to me. It's like education benefits. I can totally see that.

115
00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:15.999
Tyler: Yeah, II think that makes a lot of sense. I'm seeing that now, that's really helpful. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna pretend like.

116
00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:22.580
Tyler: today you're not gonna sign in what do you think will be different if we don't sign in

117
00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:24.280
Tyler: to ask a question?

118
00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:30.939
> P12: Well, I would think that

119
00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:32.880
> P12: I wasn't getting there

120
00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:42.220
> P12: like the full benefit of the page without. I think I'd get back to like a watered down version. Right?

121
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:49.170
Tyler: Hmm, yeah. When you say a watered down version? What do you kind of? Can you describe that to me?

122
00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:53.560
> P12: Probably like a separate web page? That

123
00:13:55.310 --> 00:14:00.460
> P12: It just has a list of maybe on defense. And

124
00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:04.460
> P12: I guess maybe just a generic

125
00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:08.030
Tyler: answer to some of that.

126
00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:21.780
Tyler: you know, into, like some of the things I wanted to know about this website? Yeah, totally. So it feels like it'll be more generic. You'll get like less specific information. And you called it like a watered down version. If you don't sign in.

127
00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:32.350
Tyler: that's really helpful. I think that makes sense. Okay. So we're gonna click, continue without signing in. So I've just clicked that. And now we're on this new page. Can you describe to me what we're looking at here?

128
00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:36.430
> P12: Yeah, just

129
00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:40.569
> P12: it's trying to to categorize like

130
00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:51.079
> P12: subject topic topic like what I want to ask the question about and hit the dropdown and then I would guess, if you like, yeah, that's what I figured like education and disability.

131
00:14:51.160 --> 00:15:07.309
Tyler:  okay, cool. So now, it's obviously showing you more things besides, just education, which was kind of confusing before, if your question is about getting your how to get your hearing checked. What would you choose in this list?

132
00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:17.119
Tyler: Health healthcare healthcare. Okay, let's go ahead and choose healthcare. So I'm going to click. Continue. Now we'll go to the next page.

133
00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.850
Tyler: And now, can you describe to me what we're seeing here?

134
00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:23.890
> P12: Yeah. pretty much

135
00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:26.540
> P12: like

136
00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:32.810
Tyler: I would click on that first one. Okay.

137
00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:34.590
Tyler: awesome.

138
00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:47.679
Tyler: I'm gonna move us along just because of the interest of time. But that felt like pretty quick. It was pretty obvious that it was healthcare. And now it feels like pretty obvious to choose audiology and hearing aids. So we'll click. Continue now.

139
00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:52.320
Tyler: And now, what are we seeing on this page?

140
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:53.260
> P12: A

141
00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:01.469
> P12: if it was specific to me, or if it was a general question case.

142
00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.590
> P12: guess if I had

143
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:07.720
> P12: a veteran who I was helping

144
00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:15.910
> P12: click on someone else's behavior. Benefits. Like, if I'm the son or daughter a little veteran, I guess.

145
00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.560
Tyler: trying to get help for them.

146
00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:20.129
> P12: Our caregiver me?

147
00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:27.390
Tyler: Right? Okay. So in this scenario, where you have a question about how to get your hearing checked.

148
00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:33.949
Tyler: yeah, I would just do me. I would go my own Va. Benefit your own Va. Benefits. Okay, cool.

149
00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:36.859
Tyler: And when would you use? It's a general question.

150
00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:40.919
> P12: I guess I could use it for this one.

151
00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.480
Tyler: But

152
00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:48.559
> P12: I, me. Personally, I would do my own. Va benefits a general question

153
00:16:49.890 --> 00:17:00.039
> P12:  well, I guess, if it was something like, like my, the closest facility to me, or

154
00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:09.509
> P12: maybe to get a number like a 1 800 number. But I can see that set the bottom of the page. And

155
00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:10.790
Tyler: okay.

156
00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:19.119
Tyler: that's really helpful. So you described how you might use these different options. And for today we'll choose my own Va benefits like you said.

157
00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:27.819
Tyler: so I'm gonna go ahead and click to the next screen before I do that. How how much longer do you think this is? Gonna take [P12], this process.

158
00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:34.790
> P12: this? I would think it wouldn't take long, maybe like 5 min.

159
00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:38.960
Tyler: What other kinds of questions do you feel like the Va. Needs to ask you?

160
00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:44.569
> P12: And and my question was about getting my a hearing.

161
00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:47.089
Tyler: Yeah, it was about getting your hearing checked.

162
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:58.349
> P12: Well, I guess if I clicked on my own Va. Benefits. Tell me if I was eligible to get my in, which, if it was.

163
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:05.140
> P12: it's to lose free like a free, you know, like it was.

164
00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:09.699
> P12: I guess if it was a free hearing exam, or

165
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:13.510
Tyler: or whatever

166
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.480
> P12: I would see is like

167
00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:23.400
> P12: it would tell me where I'm at. I guess you know I have, like priority, one priority, 2

168
00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:27.100
> P12:  for healthcare.

169
00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:35.749
> P12: and then II guess I would expect to see like a list like, Do you want an appointment. Do you want?

170
00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:40.379
> P12: like, from a previous

171
00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:52.189
Tyler: okay, cool. So we're gonna choose my own Va benefits. And then we're thinking the questions might be trying to check. If you're eligible, if your benefits will cover getting your hearing checked.

172
00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:54.330
Tyler: That makes sense.

173
00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:57.460
Tyler:  let's go ahead and click continue.

174
00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:03.420
Tyler: And now we're on this next page here. Can you describe this to me?

175
00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:11.419
> P12: Yeah, it's just while while we're contacting the Va

176
00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:14.690
Tyler: why is the Va asking you this?

177
00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:20.439
> P12: I guess to figure out where to

178
00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:25.690
> P12: like our who do we refer your question to? Or what?

179
00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:28.070
Tyler: Hmm,

180
00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:40.989
> P12: because I guess if it's like customer service, I guess it pretty much would be the complaint or say something nicer the suggestion  but I think the other 2 would like redirect you somewhere else

181
00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:45.420
Tyler: okay? So they're trying to figure out where to send your question.

182
00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:46.710
Tyler: That makes sense.

183
00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:50.850
Tyler: Does this feel like the right moment in this process for them to ask you that?

184
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:57.050
> P12:  yeah, I would think so.

185
00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:58.540
Tyler: Yeah, okay, cool.

186
00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:03.940
Tyler: Alright. I'm gonna click. Well, which one would you choose here in this scenario?

187
00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:13.210
Tyler: I have a question. Okay, let's go ahead and choose that. And did I send a little bit of a laugh on your end?

188
00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:25.030
> P12: No yeah. Cause. And then cause I'm trying to figure out right to make an appointment. So I have a question like, maybe how to make my appointment.

189
00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.970
> P12: The contact to make.

190
00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:35.179
Tyler: Yeah, okay. do you think you'd ever use this form for a different one of these options just personally?

191
00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:47.779
> P12:  I guess maybe

192
00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:51.550
> P12: for the complaint or the the compliment.

193
00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:53.929
Tyler: either, either. One?

194
00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.020
> P12: Well.

195
00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:57.830
> P12: I guess we're probably not as often.

196
00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:05.580
Tyler: Yeah, not as often. Okay, cool. We're going to click, continue. And now, what are we seeing here? What what do we do on this page?

197
00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:10.390
Tyler: Just type in what my questions

198
00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:16.870
> P12: like I'll just put in like. can I make an appointment for

199
00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:20.670
> P12: a hearing test or hearing exams

200
00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:28.620
Tyler: cool. So we just type in our question. And you described how you might do that. And at this point, how much longer do you think this is going to take?

201
00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:32.170
> P12: Oh.

202
00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:39.469
> P12: right here from looking at that box, I would think it was gonna take a little longer.

203
00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:51.160
Tyler: Which which box are you looking at to help you figure that out because usually like you know when you're, like on a chat, like, how we were in that last one.

204
00:21:51.230 --> 00:22:00.629
> P12: And you saying, Can you hear me? And I was like, no, I can't hear. That's the kind of box I would expect to see this, I'd be looking like they're gonna get back to me in 3 to 4 days, or.

205
00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:02.619
> P12: you know, like it's not gonna be

206
00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:07.430
> P12: it. It's gonna take a while. That's what this box.

207
00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:17.389
Tyler: Okay, Gotcha. So you don't feel like it's like a one on one chat with somebody the way we were doing. It's more like, I'm submitting this. And then you're going to get back to me in a while.

208
00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.890
> P12: right like when you submit a question to

209
00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:36.790
Tyler: so website or something. And they're asking, do this. And then they'll tell you like, we'll get back to 2 to 3 business days, or whatever. Right? Okay, that's really helpful. So the way this looks make you feel like it'll be that experience where it takes a bit longer, and you have to wait on them

210
00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:43.609
Tyler: like a chat box when it says you want to chat to me, you know, with an agent, or do you want to chat

211
00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:54.949
Tyler: right? Exactly. That makes sense. That's that's a really helpful observation. Alright, I'm gonna click, continue. So we're gonna pretend like we typed in your question. I'm not actually gonna type it in today.

212
00:22:55.260 --> 00:23:05.450
Tyler: And now we're seeing this page. Can you show me how you would? Or can you tell me how you would answer this page? And why do you think the Va. Asked you that?

213
00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:11.110
> P12:  I don't know, because they asked you

214
00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:15.370
> P12: on the first question. It was like you were, gonna

215
00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:21.109
Tyler: ask a question. And you're like, and it says, like, i'm the veteran,

216
00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:24.149
> P12: i'm doing it for someone else's claim.

217
00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:36.080
Tyler:  you know like a couple of screens back. I think you'll yeah, yeah. I remember that I know what you're talking about. So it feels like you've already. You've already told them you're a veteran.

218
00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:40.529
> P12: right? And you were because you were researching your Va.

219
00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:43.700
Tyler: right? Yeah, that makes sense.

220
00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:49.709
Tyler: So this feels repetitive. Okay? So it was easy to answer. But it does feel repetitive. So we'll click. Continue.

221
00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:54.090
Tyler: Okay. And now, what is this question here?

222
00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:58.460
> P12: Just asking if I work for the Va, right?

223
00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:05.329
Tyler: Okay, cool. So you hit now, also pretty quick to answer this one. Why did it ask if you're an employee?

224
00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:07.569
> P12: I don't know, but I noticed.

225
00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:10.270
> P12: think it does it.

226
00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:22.269
> P12: I think I've seen it before, actually, a couple of 58 questions, I mean, I don't know. Why. May I ask what I'm figuring? It must be some reason.

227
00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:39.149
Tyler: Yeah, okay, cool. We'll we'll click no, and we'll click, continue. And now we're looking at this screen. So before we start looking at this in detail. How much longer do you think this process is? Gonna take you said originally you said about 5 min.

228
00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:43.239
> P12: Yeah. Well, like, I said. And as soon as I saw that other.

229
00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:51.480
Tyler: Yeah, okay, so that seeing that, what's your question box made, you think.

230
00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:53.570
Tyler: actually, it's difficult to

231
00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:57.629
> P12: a which is, tell us about yourself.

232
00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:02.449
> P12: did we at the beginning? Did we click?

233
00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:06.450
> P12: Do we sign in? I know

234
00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:11.009
Tyler: we didn't sign in. How do you think that would impact what this page looks like.

235
00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:12.680
Tyler: or whether it's here.

236
00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:15.420
> P12: I would.

237
00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:17.000
> P12: Ouch.

238
00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:21.930
Tyler: thinking, okay, if we signed in, it should already be up there like

239
00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.550
> P12: like auto flow.

240
00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:34.220
Tyler: Okay, that makes sense. So if you sign in, you think this should be auto filled?  and you would just like review it and make sure it's right.

241
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:41.189
Tyler: Okay, Gotcha. And in this case we didn't sign in. So that's why

242
00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:43.040
> P12: they're asking us.

243
00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:45.709
Tyler: okay. yeah, that makes sense.

244
00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:52.309
Tyler: So let's go ahead and look through these together. So tell me if anything stands out at you, I'm gonna scroll slowly.

245
00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:11.030
Tyler: Yeah, just the pronouns. Okay, let's talk about the pronouns. What makes that stand out to you?

246
00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:20.109
> P12:  I think that's just a personal preference as far as, like.

247
00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:22.880
Tyler:  some people.

248
00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:26.510
yes.

249
00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.159
> P12: more liberal

250
00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:29.670
Tyler: there's

251
00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:31.660
and

252
00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:39.240
> P12: like me. II think, like, I'm more conservative. I'm thinking that, do we really need that? Yeah.

253
00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:41.670
> P12: yeah.

254
00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:45.859
Tyler: that makes sense. So actually, like, when I first saw it

255
00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:47.380
> P12: right?

256
00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:49.400
> P12: This again. Like.

257
00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:51.570
> P12: really

258
00:26:51.730 --> 00:27:08.820
Tyler: right? Like, I said, that's a personal opinion. So yeah, well, I'm here to learn your personal opinion. So that that's helpful to understand. If if that's how you felt. What would you do here? Does it look like you need to answer this, or what? What are your options.

259
00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:10.180
> P12: Well.

260
00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:11.580
there.

261
00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:16.460
> P12: to me, that's kind of like you know how they ask.

262
00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:21.150
> P12:  like, do you want to answer if you're Hispanic, or

263
00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.590
Tyler: whatever

264
00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:30.790
> P12: but it's not required. So I don't think this should be required.

265
00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:38.500
Tyler: So if they are going to ask you this.

266
00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:42.179
> P12: But I understand everybody gets offended. So

267
00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:45.409
Tyler: okay. So

268
00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:56.610
Tyler: it feels like it shouldn't be required. And then you say, actually, it almost feels like this doesn't need to be here. But you kind of understand where it's coming from. It just doesn't feel like something you need.

269
00:27:57.490 --> 00:28:09.250
Tyler: Yeah. that makes sense. That's really helpful feedback. II wanna jump up here real quick and talk about one more thing before we move on. We've got social security number or service number here.

270
00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:11.960
Tyler: Right?

271
00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:20.510
Tyler: Obviously. Don't tell me your social security number. But how would you answer this? Would you put in your social security number? Would you put in your service number?

272
00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:30.070
Tyler: But my understanding is that

273
00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:35.670
> P12: chances are that your service numbers, basically your social security number

274
00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:41.329
> P12: unless it came in during a certain time like Vietnam or something.

275
00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:44.480
Tyler: Okay, Gotcha, people actually get drafted.

276
00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:52.279
Tyler: Right? Okay? So for you, because of when you join the service, you you have a social security number as your service number.

277
00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:54.499
Tyler: Okay, cool.

278
00:28:54.630 --> 00:29:03.560
Tyler: Alright, I'm gonna move us along just in the interest of time. But I'm curious if your reaction to pronouns is the same for gender or different.

279
00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.040
> P12: Yeah, pretty much.

280
00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:09.399
> P12: But I think the problem

281
00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:14.379
Tyler: okay. so pretty much the same reaction, but a little bit more

282
00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:18.499
Tyler: frustrated for for lack of a better word with the pronouns.

283
00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:24.840
Tyler: Okay, cool. alright. Well, we'll click. Continue. We'll pretend like we filled in these questions.

284
00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:42.760
Tyler: And now we don't have a lot of time. So I'm just gonna skip through this really quick. And I'm gonna tell you what I'm doing as I skip through it. Okay, so we've got this question where it's saying your Va health facility, and you can search by name, or you can search by location. So I'm gonna pretend, like we're searching by name. And your facility starts with James.

285
00:29:42.820 --> 00:30:02.560
Tyler: So we type in James. Now we're looking in this list to find the right one. Let's say your facility is James J. Peter's. So we choose that facility. Okay? And I'm we're seeing this list. And normally, I'd be asking for your feedback. But I wanna make sure we move us along. So we're gonna say, we chose this one and we're gonna click, continue okay?

286
00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:10.100
Tyler: Alright. So before we ask about this page, how much longer do you think this form is going to be

287
00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:21.490
> P12:  

288
00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:25.499
> P12: I don't know. Maybe like

289
00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:31.870
> P12: now, I'm thinking, like another 15 min slowed down.

290
00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:39.270
> P12: I mean, II figure it would have been pretty easy, like, I think, if I were to sign in. But we have my information.

291
00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:41.079
> P12: I just hate.

292
00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:43.330
Tyler: you know. Can I can.

293
00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:44.529
> P12: or maybe just

294
00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:49.360
> P12: even another button that says Set, you know, make an appointment.

295
00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:52.660
Tyler: Hmm, okay. So this feels like

296
00:30:52.840 --> 00:31:07.049
Tyler: throughout the process. Your expectations keep shifting. And you're like, Wow, this is taking longer than I thought. And then again, okay, this is taking a lot longer than I expected. Right? And I think when it first started, I was like should be fairly quick, and then you hit that.

297
00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:14.770
Tyler: you know type in your question here. I was like

298
00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:17.089
> P12: then, when you add to the pronouns. And

299
00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:26.270
> P12: I don't know what the other one was sexuality or something, and I was like to me, it's already taken too long.

300
00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:31.419
> P12:  but I can't just say that

301
00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:56.549
Tyler: should have been more. Simple and if you if you'd signed in, we would have had some of your information right? Would we still be asking you all these questions? If you signed in, or would? How would that different transgender question?

302
00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:01.209
> P12: I mean, II think it was one longer it needed

303
00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:04.699
> P12: so hopefully, I wish I wish we can sign in

304
00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:09.549
> P12: your information. Is there? Maybe has a couple of buttons, you know, like.

305
00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:14.509
> P12: okay, cause this is under health care, right? Or is it just?

306
00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:21.630
Tyler: Yeah. Cause we did right? We went to healthcare on that dropdown. Yeah, we did

307
00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:25.629
> P12: so when you sign in, I would hope that it would just be like

308
00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:33.109
> P12: like there'd be like a couple of questions located facility, make an appointment.

309
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:43.030
> P12: and then I guess some stuff that sounds like that. My healthy fat, you know, like prescriptions, or whatever.

310
00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:45.250
Tyler: Yeah.

311
00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:57.710
Tyler: that makes sense. So this feels like in general like this is too long. It should be more simple. There should be less questions, even if I did sign in this still would be a little bit too much information for what I'm actually trying to do.

312
00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:00.450
> P12: Right. I would, I would hope, like.

313
00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:06.930
> P12: after you signed in it would ask you, hey? What would you like to do? Point click on appointment?

314
00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:11.710
Tyler: Then maybe ask, you look nearest facility. You click on that

315
00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:15.990
Tyler: right? Okay, yeah.

316
00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:20.679
Tyler: That makes sense. Why do you think it's asking for your phone number and email here?

317
00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:24.320
Tyler: Oh, just to contact you. Okay.

318
00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:30.129
Tyler: So we'll pretend like we're putting in your phone and email, and we'll go to the next page.

319
00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:33.309
Tyler: And on this page, what would you normally choose here?

320
00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:38.299
> P12: A but

321
00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:49.600
Tyler: phone communities, they had like text text, okay. so you'd prefer text. But you'd choose phone, probably on this page

322
00:33:50.580 --> 00:34:04.150
Tyler: phone or email. awesome. So for the purpose of looking at sometimes like, are they gonna call me? Because I know a lot of people like myself. I don't answer numbers like, I don't know. Or.

323
00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:18.910
Tyler: yeah. Yeah. So E, email is a good kind of backup option. Yeah, that's a good point. Alright. Well, text will be nice to see. Yeah.

324
00:34:18.949 --> 00:34:20.710
Tyler: yeah, I can definitely see that

325
00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:22.070
> P12: fine.

326
00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:25.199
> P12: All right? Well, suspecting a colleges.

327
00:34:25.469 --> 00:34:33.039
Tyler:  yeah, that makes sense so text would be nice to see cause you're assuming phone probably means a call.

328
00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:37.639
Tyler: right, I mean, I would be hoping it would be technically.

329
00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:42.010
Tyler: yeah, that's helpful it maybe that's not super clear by just saying phone.

330
00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:44.349
so I think that's really good feedback.

331
00:34:44.489 --> 00:35:09.460
Tyler: Okay? So for for now we've only got a couple of minutes left in our session. We're gonna just I'm gonna click through some screens, and I'm gonna tell you what I'm doing, cause I want you to get to the end of the process because I know it's really unsatisfying to not finish something. So we're gonna click on us mail. We're gonna pretend like, that's your preference. I know that's not your preference. And then we would be asking for your country here. Okay, so I'm gonna choose United States just to move us along.

332
00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:18.960
Tyler: And now we're asking for your mailing address. Okay, so just a pretty standard mailing address form, and we'll pretend like we filled that out. And I'm gonna click, continue.

333
00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:25.079
Tyler: And now we're seeing this where we're confirming your mailing address. Have you seen something like this before?

334
00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:30.289
Tyler: Okay, so we're gonna go with the suggested address. And I'm gonna click, continue

335
00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:36.600
Tyler: alright. So can you tell me what we're seeing on this page. What's the purpose of this page?

336
00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:37.780
Right?

337
00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:49.640
> P12: I guess you're trying to narrow it down to? To give you an answer to your question.

338
00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:51.460
Tyler: Umhm. Okay.

339
00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:57.800
Tyler: so are they going to ask you more questions to narrow it down?

340
00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:05.950
> P12:  And it's see to me it's kind of

341
00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:16.590
> P12: little repetitive, because when we first came in, it had those questions you wanted to know about and it. And we click like health care.

342
00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:25.769
> P12: You know. We didn't click education. We didn't click. So the category, you can already know it's

343
00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:28.050
pertains healthcare.

344
00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:39.230
> P12:  I mean, I would just like to see like. Like I said, like, Hey, maybe it's like like 40 interested in appointment.

345
00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:46.540
> P12: your health records. And I guess maybe that's what this is. But to me it's just asking.

346
00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:50.830
> P12: like too many things again, like.

347
00:36:52.120 --> 00:37:10.699
> P12: I can totally see that. And it's been really helpful the way just we just put in everything we just put in, you know, social or data, birth or address, our pronouns, or whatever. And then it's asking for more pro or like. Oh, I guess that's what my question has right. My, if my question is up.

348
00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:14.690
> P12: is about my personal information in this

349
00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:20.760
Tyler: Umhm. Right? So this

350
00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:29.830
> P12: I would think those would be the questions people are gonna ask about either an appointment.  their medication

351
00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:31.740
> P12: health records

352
00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:32.720
and

353
00:37:34.410 --> 00:37:37.930
> P12: that's about it and then I, guess they would narrow it down from there.

354
00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:58.240
Tyler:  that makes a lot of sense. I can see how this feels really repetitive and it's not really meeting your expectation generally speaking of how the service would work. So that's really useful feedback. Because of the time I'm just gonna go ahead and submit our question. I'm gonna have to click through. I think.

355
00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:02.960
Tyler: Some things. So you can just bear with me real quick.

356
00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:04.800
Tyler: and

357
00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:13.379
Tyler: we'll submit the question. Okay, so now we're on this page. This is the last page in the service, or in this website.

358
00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:19.280
Tyler: can you have a read through this? And then just tell me what you what you learned.

359
00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:25.959
> P12: Yeah, that's pretty much what like, I said, when I saw that one question, I would. I'm like, okay, they're gonna get back to

360
00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:33.350
Tyler: right? Okay, cause you're like, I have to wait now. And I thought I was, gonna get a response right away.

361
00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.819
> P12: right? Cause you're

362
00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:46.059
> P12: saying about cause we're gonna make it a hearing exam, right? That's what it was for. Like. yeah, yeah, this is way, too long.

363
00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:47.950
Tyler: Yeah, okay.

364
00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:54.320
Tyler: that's really helpful. I'm gonna stop sharing my screen. I see we've only got like a minute or 2 left.

365
00:38:54.330 --> 00:39:07.520
Tyler: So we can just chat for the last minute or 2. It was really helpful to hear your reflections throughout that I'm so glad we managed to get that working so we could hear some of your feedback. It was really useful.

366
00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:25.509
Tyler:  I'm curious like. Throughout that process we talked about this scenario where you're, you know, setting up this, you wanna ask the Va, how to get your hearing checked. But I wonder if this would be any different or your reaction would be any different if your question wasn't about your healthcare.

367
00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:28.120
Tyler: So let's say, your question was like.

368
00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:30.209
Tyler: which education benefit?

369
00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:37.619
> P12: Yeah, no. Then I think maybe. But even then 7 days.

370
00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:46.089
Tyler: Right? Okay. So unless it was like a really like

371
00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:49.149
> P12: specific question.

372
00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:52.190
> P12: because otherwise, I think.

373
00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:55.840
> P12: like that, this is the app or the website.

374
00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:59.450
Tyler: This is on the website. Well, this will be on the website.

375
00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:01.429
> P12: Let's see that.

376
00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:06.780
> P12: And this is it.

377
00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:14.439
Tyler: To me, it really doesn't seem that helpful. Yeah, I think that makes sense. It feels like.

378
00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:15.980
Tyler: go ahead.

379
00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:17.919
> P12: The time wasted

380
00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:33.019
> P12: putting in all your info, and then I'll send. Then you gotta wait 7 days for the answer, and I think that people are. Maybe it's maybe it's just our expectation. Now, everybody wants everything quickly, you know. I think, using the

381
00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:40.889
> P12: the website's not that bad right now, because a lot of times you can click on stuff like you said like education benefits. And it tells you like the process.

382
00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:44.400
> P12: or it will direct to, you know, send you in the right direction.

383
00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:55.149
> P12: You know what I mean. I mean it. It does kind of suck cause. Sometimes you go in between like it seems like I know they're trying to like

384
00:40:55.750 --> 00:41:05.880
> P12: combine them all. But, like before you, it's like you'd have to go to my healthy bed then, if you wanted to see something, you had to go to a different website, and you'd have to use a different login.

385
00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:09.770
Tyler: totally, you know, between, like 2 or 3 Web Star.

386
00:41:10.110 --> 00:41:15.310
> P12: for I guess sites. And and I think you're doing a better job now. But

387
00:41:15.830 --> 00:41:35.989
Tyler: right? Okay, so you feel like this isn't really adding value to the way that the website is already set up where you can go and find information, and it will be like there for you, whereas here you have to put in a bunch of information, and then you have to wait 7 days, right? I can totally see how that doesn't meet your expectations, and

388
00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:38.920
Tyler: it doesn't really add extra value for you.

389
00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:49.930
Tyler: So, [P12], I see we're at our time. I do want to give you a couple of minutes in case you want to ask me any questions. Was this your first time taking part in research?

390
00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:55.119
Tyler: No, II did one other one.

391
00:41:56.770 --> 00:42:00.500
> P12: I can't remember what that one? Yeah, that's okay.

392
00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:02.930
> P12: Do you have any questions for me?

393
00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:08.180
> P12: I guess I guess the biggest thing on this.

394
00:42:08.250 --> 00:42:20.570
> P12: Just if they would have put a comma. Yeah, I know that was really good.

395
00:42:21.110 --> 00:42:22.920
Tyler: Yeah, totally.

396
00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:50.239
Tyler: That makes a lot of sense. And we've we've spoken to some other veterans who have also found it confusing that it's not just about education but didn't necessarily call out that a comma could help. So that was really useful. And honestly, all of your feedback is really useful. You noticed a lot of things that I would never notice, and that other people haven't noticed. So that's why we really value spending some time with you like this. I also particularly appreciate that

397
00:42:50.240 --> 00:43:00.769
Tyler: it was super hard to get set up on Zoom this morning, and I'm sorry about that. I appreciate you pushing through, and I'm glad it worked out.

398
00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:15.649
Tyler: But yeah, thank you so much for your time I'm gonna let you go and I hope you have a lovely rest of your day. If you have any questions you can reach out to the folks who set up this session. They're gonna send you a thank you. Note so you can ask them any questions if you have them.

399
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:19.330
Tyler: Alright. Thank you. Thanks, [P12].

400
00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:20.760
> P12: Bye.
