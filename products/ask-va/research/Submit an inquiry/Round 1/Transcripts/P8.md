## Transcript - NEED TO CLEAN UP

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Awesome. Alright, so I'm gonna start the recording and once I do that. I'm gonna ask you to confirm.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Alright, so are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio today?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I am.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Perfect. Thank you, Brenda. So we've got through the beginning of the session. I know we lost a little bit of time just trying to get ourselves set up, which is.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Totally understandable.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Here by doing it this morning and then

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Yeah, I appreciate that. So much. Well, we got here, so it's totally not your fault.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Let's just chat for a second about how long.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Oh! Are you?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
How long have you been a veteran Brenda?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I joined the Navy in 1985.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And I, processed out of.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Active duty in 1987 and then I went reserves until nineteen-

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Okay.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Since 1989 I guess.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Yeah. Did you start interacting with the VA right away or only a last couple of years?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:07.000
No, start with the VA until, 2010, 2011 somewhere in there.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
When I lost my medical insurance.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Okay, yeah, that makes sense. And we talked for a second about, wanting to get in touch with your caregiver.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I'm wondering, when you contact the VA, do you usually contact the VA over the phone online or another way.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Yeah.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Messaging, cause it's easier than calling them and waiting forever for this and that. Oh, I'm a message, but it usually goes into a general mailbox.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Sometimes the caregiver that I have doesn't get the message.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Right, okay, so are you using my healthy vet when you're sending messages? Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Yes.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So that's gonna be a really useful comparison for me today. So the secure messaging on my healthy.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Bet is pretty similar to what I'm working on today.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Everybody can see your message to your caregiver.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Okay. Yeah, so we're gonna, I'm gonna ask. It's not private anymore, right?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Any more.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Yeah, so I'll ask you some more questions about that as we continue because that'll be really helpful for me to learn more about.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
What we're gonna do now is we're gonna share a prototype. So this is gonna take a little bit of time to set up.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I'm gonna send you a link and you're gonna see it pop up on your phone. And when you see the link on your phone, I just like you to click on it.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And this is just a prototype. Like I said, this is a way for us to test, something that we're working on.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
So I'm sending you the link. On zoom and you're gonna see it pop up on your phone.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And once you've got this open on your phone, let me know and I'll tell you what we're going to do next.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Okay, I clicked on it.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Perfect. So it should be opening. On your phone.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Are you seeing a website open?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Just a minute. Nope. Do it again.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Okay, I'll send it again.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
I know I touched it.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
No worries.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
I touched it. Okay, here we go.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Yep.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Alright, so now it's opening up on your phone. Okay, perfect. So now that the website is open on your phone, what I need you to do is to share your screen with me.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Is that something you've done before?

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
This phone doesn't do that.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
It doesn't do that.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000
No, that's why I was looking forward to the.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Yeah.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
The computer.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Okay.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
So I'm in I'm in the app that you want me to look at. You want me to sign in?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:55.000
No, not yet. So I'm gonna need to be able to see the same thing that you're seeing throughout our call.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000
So if you don't think that we'll be able to share on your phone, that I'm going to need to share on my computer and you're gonna have to look at what I'm looking at.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Bye.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Okay. Alright.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:16.000
So we're back. Yeah, so we have 2 options. I can share on my computer or we can switch to your computer.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000
You're on yours, that's fine.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Okay, I'll share on my computer for today. So. Let me just.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
That way you see me too.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Yes. That sounds good.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And I work on getting a wireless camera.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Sounds good. Alright, just give me one moment to set this up on my computer.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:47.000
I had to get a wireless keyboard and a wireless mouse cause he chewed those cords up too.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Okay.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Oh gosh. Yeah, maybe. Maybe the cat needs a different space. Away from the computer.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Alright, can you see what I'm sharing now? Okay, so what is it? Can you describe it to me?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
I can.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
What does it look like?

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:09.000
It says ask VA and then it says signing in is required and then it's a sign in or create an account.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000
So.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Perfect. Okay. So what are you noticing first on this page?

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Of the VA.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Okay, so you notice you're on a VA. Gov site. And what is this page let you do?

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Let me sign in.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Okay, it's a sign in page and if you sign in, what would happen next?

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
What would happen after you sign in?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Me to go through the things where I have to do a double sign in because I do the double step thing.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Yeah.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:51.000
And then I get in there, it'll go to the VA. Gov site, you know, they give me a dashboard to tell me where I can go.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Okay.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Like I can check. My medications, my appointments. My claims. And I forgot what the other one was.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Right.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
That's okay. So it sounds like this page it feels like it's for signing in. And once we sign in, we're going to go to the homepage.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.000
I'm gonna give you a second to just read it a little bit more closely, so I'll stop right here.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Okay.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Is there anything new that you're noticing?

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Other than the signing in is required and it sign in or create an account? No.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Okay, that sounds good. So. This is a way for you to ask the VA a question.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000
That was on this site yesterday.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Okay, so. This is. That was on the site yesterday. Okay, what do you mean by that?

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
I was on the site yesterday.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Yeah.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000
You were on this site yesterday? Okay. Got it. So for the rest of our conversation, we're gonna pretend like you need to ask the VA a question.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:02.000
So I'm gonna give you a scenario. We're gonna say that you've recently noticed you have some problems with your hearing and you want to ask the VA how to get your hearing checked.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Oh.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
So you don't know how to get your hearing checked. All you know is you need to probably go see an audiologist.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Okay. So.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
I have to contact my caregiver.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Okay, so you would contact your caregiver first. Yeah, that makes sense. So if we were on this page, it sounds like we need to sign in, right?

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:35.000
I'm going to scroll down a little bit further. I'm gonna give you a moment to read this.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Okay, this is familiar.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Yeah.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Yeah, why is this familiar? You remember seeing this on? . Okay So can you tell me why signing in?

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Is helpful.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Because it automatically goes to my information and I don't have to input it. Thank you.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Got it. Okay. Yeah. And what if we were not gonna sign in today?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
What if we didn't want to sign in? Is that an option?

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Yeah, so continue without signing in.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Okay, got it. So we kind of know the benefit of signing in is that they're gonna have your information.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
But there's also an option to not sign in. Okay. Alright, so let's click on continue without signing in.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Right.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:26.000
We're gonna imagine you don't want to sign in and you're asking the VA a question about getting your hearing checked.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
So can you describe this page to me?

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:40.000
It says, Okay. I can upload any documents I need to upload. For any benefits.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:51.000
That I'm looking into and it says select the category the best. Described. Your question. So it gives me, an area where I can look for.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Key information. To ask a question in a certain area so I don't have to go and blindly.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Got it. Okay. So I'm gonna open this so that you can have a look, okay?

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Okay.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:18.000
So I'll scroll down. Tell me what you're seeing here.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000
So.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
It gives me a list like education benefits, disability compensation. Debt for overpayment or This decision, and just basic information.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Basic information. Okay. And so if you came here because you had a question about how to get your hearing checked, what would you do here?

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
I'd go to healthcare.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Huh.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
You go to healthcare. Does that feel like an easy choice? How do you know that it's healthcare?

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Because that's the only way to get to my, care team.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Okay. So we'll click on healthcare. And how important do you think it is to answer this question correctly?

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Which one's that?

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:59.000
This question here, healthcare, how important is it to choose the right option?

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Oh, it takes you totally in different areas. So if you don't answer that question correctly, then you're not going to get the answer you need and they're going to give you the runaround.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Hmm, okay. What's the run around? Can you describe that to me?

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.000
They'll send you to different areas until you get to the right area and sometimes it's a hundred areas.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Okay, so we know that we're gonna get sent somewhere depending on what we choose. So it's important we choose the right one.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Yes.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Yeah, that makes sense. Alright, we're gonna click continue.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Can you just describe this page to me?

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.000
It gives me a list of what I wanna ask questions about. And like you said, ideology is the first one.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
So that's the hearing. When I was like that. Yep.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Okay, so we choose audiology. Yeah. What's the difference between this page and the last page?

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:56.000
This one is more precise to what I'm looking for like. Health care information.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000
But they stop missing.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Yeah, that makes sense. There's stuff missing. Tell me about that.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:10.000
I deal with a lot of stuff out of town, so. I don't go to my local VA, they send me to Ann Arbor.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Okay.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
And there's no way on here to show Ann Arbor or Detroit.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Right, okay, so you're already trying to figure out which medical center you're dealing with because you want to go to the right one.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Yeah, that's really helpful.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Because they're the same system.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Okay. What's this gray box?

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Your category topic category healthcare. That's telling me that I'm in the right area.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Okay. And how much longer do you think this form is going to be?

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.000
I hope not very much longer. Cause there's a lot on here.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Yeah.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
But it's a little, I mean.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:09.000
I get ideology is at the top and they're trying to do alphabetical order but they should go and order like

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
You're going to the VA for medical reasons.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
So your care team should be at the top.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Okay, so you wish that this was an order of like the most common use. Right, that makes sense.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Right.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
And you notice that it's alphabetical instead. Okay.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Right. I get the alphabetical, I understand that. But.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:48.000
This is supposed to be my information is already in the system and I know this is the general one. Most people that look on here, even though they didn't sign in.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Would want to. Go to their medical team. And I don't see a pharmacy on here.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Okay, so we're looking for things automatically that you're used to seeing maybe in my healthy vet or or other health care tasks you do on VA.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Gov.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
As pharmacy.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Yeah. That makes sense.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:18.000
So medicine should be on here and then oh and Community care.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Okay, so we're missing a couple of key tasks that you do related to your health care. And that's a little confusing.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Yeah. The only time I go to the local VA is for yearly exams or if I need something like I got an appointment coming up for a wheelchair.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Okay.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:43.000
I had to go to the VA to do that. But other than that, I spend 90% of my time in Ann Arbor.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Gotcha. Alright. Let's continue. Let's keep.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Cause I have a So anything I do. They wanna have down with the cardiologist. Cause he comes out of the U of M.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:04.000
So they send me down to Ann Arbor VA to deal with all that so that the cardiologist can get on board with everything going on.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Right, okay. So it's really important to you at this point that you're getting sent to the right place and that's not obvious right now.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Okay.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Yeah, that's helpful. So we're gonna click continue. And now we're on a new page.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Can you show me or can you tell me, sorry, what you would do on this page?

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:28.000
I would go to it's a general question.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Because, I want to ask about ideology and getting tested for hearing. And if I go to my own VA benefits, that'll take me into a totally different screen.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Off of medical information.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Right. What are you imagining will happen if you choose my own benefits?

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000
So send me to like a financial page to tell me what all my benefits are.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Okay, got it. So this is a general

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
And I have any other than medical.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Okay, gotcha. So you know that you need to ask a question. So you're gonna choose it's a general question.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000
Right.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Okay, so this is gonna throw you off a little bit, but we're actually gonna choose my own benefits, which I know doesn't match your expectation, but that's really useful feedback.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000
So we're gonna click my own benefits. And now just for a moment, let's pause.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
How much longer do you think this form is?

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
I hope not very much longer.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Yeah, how would you figure out how much longer it is? Is there any way to figure that out?

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Yeah.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
But continue and see what's on the next page. And is that the top 2 of 4 questions?

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Okay, it says 2 or 4 questions. So. How many more questions do you think there are?

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Well, other than the 2 that they give you. I'd say a little bit more because you want to get into a more

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000
Wanna get down to where you can get your question answered.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:08.000
Right, okay. When we're imagining using this website, do you think that you're going to get your question?

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
On the spot. Like a

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:18.000
It'll get to general, it'll get to a general answer and it'll tell me where to go to get the more precise answer.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Gotcha, okay. Is it gonna give you like a link to a website to read or how?

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Generally, usually it gives me, Place the call within the VA to get what I need.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Okay, okay, so we're figuring out where to go. And the VA system through answering these questions.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Yeah.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Yes, cause if the VA to get these questions answered, you'd go to 20 different people before they sent you to the right department.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Right. Yeah, that makes sense. So this is you're seeing this as a way to make sure you can call the right person more directly.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Perfect. Okay.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Right. Before I get to the calling part because I know how that works.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Yeah. Alright, we're gonna continue. We're gonna click. Continue.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:14.000
And now we're looking at this new page. Can you describe this to me?

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
Oh, it has a list of

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Things that you could contact them about like. Questions or say something else or Complaint. I have a suggestion.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000
Oh, I attended a town hall. I want to say something else.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:42.000
Usually when I attend a town hall, I wait for the end of it and then I have questions and then I get everything answered.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Hmm, okay, so that doesn't feel like something you would choose. Cause you would answer them.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000
Yeah.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
No. If I get it right at the town hall, I wouldn't.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Right. Okay.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
If they don't answer it right away, they call me back 2 or 3 days later.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Yeah. Why do you think the VA is asking this?

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000
Because a lot of people don't know they can ask questions at the town hall.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Okay, so you think maybe this question is a way for people to learn the different reasons they can contact the VA.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Right.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000
I push, I have a question.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Okay, what would you do in this scenario? What would you choose? Okay. Let's do that.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:28.000
We'll choose. I have a question. We're gonna click continue now.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000
And now we're on this page. Can you describe this to me? What would you do here?

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:39.000
I would put in the box on having trouble hearing. Where do I go next?

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:45.000
Yeah, would, would you write quite a short question or would you give a lot of information?

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:54.000
No, I'd write a short question, so when they get back to me. We can have a discussion.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:01.000
Okay. So this is just a way for you to kind of get into that conversation and then you're gonna have a more in-depth discussion.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Yeah, I put that I'm having trouble hearing so they know that it's gonna be audiology.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:17.000
I need to Contact. And then, but the care team has to get a hold of me first and then they have to refer me to audiology.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:27.000
Yeah, right, okay. And when we type in your question here, how much longer is this form going to be?

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
Shouldn't be much longer.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000
Yeah, what else do you think you'd need to give the VA at this point?

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
My contact information.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Your contact information. Is there anything else that might be missing?

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
Yeah, so.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000
Right, okay.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000
No, not on the general. This was my personal one. It would need a little more. Hope that when it goes to my personal page, it would already be on there.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
Yeah, what would already be on there?

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
Like my information and who my Met Teams are.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Yeah, okay. So if you're asking a more general question, you expect to give less information, just a way to contact you.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Yep. Yep.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:18.000
But if you're asking a more specific question, then you expect the VA to already have your information.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000
Right.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:26.000
That makes sense. Alright, so let's click continue. We'll say that we typed in your question.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:35.000
Yeah, cause you gotta remember this all goes to, a whole bunch of people, so. Your private information will be spread around.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
Yeah, who does this go to?

00:20:38.000 --> 00:21:00.000
Oh, let's see. There's a general mailbox and depending on which when you're sending it to like for instance for example When I email My, cardiologist at the VA in Ann Arbor, I have to email the clinic because he doesn't have a personal inbox.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:09.000
So the receptionist or the person at the computer when you go in gets it first, then she sends it to a different department.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:16.000
And sometimes whoever's doing that doesn't understand. Who my nurse is so it gets sent to another department.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000
And then by the time it's done, it's like 6 or 15 people.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:27.000
Right, okay, so you're expecting that you your question could bounce around a lot of people's different I would see this and so you don't wanna give a ton of information about yourself.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:37.000
You want to just keep it short and sweet and eventually you'll talk to the right person.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000
Yeah, because. I don't think the VA has heard about the HIPAA law.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:51.000
Okay. So what if this wasn't about healthcare? I know that's how you primarily interact with the VA, but let's say you had a question that was like.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:58.000
You know, I heard about this new law and I'm and I'm confused about it and I'm trying to ask the VA about it.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000
Oh, then I'd go to, patient advocacy.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:11.000
Okay. That makes sense. So let's look at this page.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Yep.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
We're seeing now. So it says your relationship to the veteran. How would you? You put on the veteran.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000
Yeah.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
Would you ever choose I'm the family member?

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
I could, I have a son that's a veteran.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Yeah, so that's a scenario where you might be the family member asking about your son.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000
Yep.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000
That makes sense.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:36.000
Is there anything else you notice on this page?

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:44.000
It just asks for personal, it just says that, tells you that they're going to ask for some more personal information.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:53.000
Do you feel like at this point you have given any personal information yet?

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.000
Okay.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000
Slightly on the last page, but not too much. I'd have to give him my contact information.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:04.000
Right, okay. Let's choose I'm the veteran and we'll click continue.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000
Now we're on this page. What are you seeing here?

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000
Don't ask me if I'm an employee and no on that.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:15.000
Okay, so it's an easy one to answer. Why is the VI asking you this?

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:23.000
Because, benefits for employees are a little bit different than benefits for veterans unless the employee is a veteran.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:34.000
Okay, gotcha. So they're gonna have different benefits. So this is gonna answering this question will impact maybe the benefits that you Have a available to you.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000
Right.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:41.000
Okay. Let's click no and then we'll click continue.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000
And now we're seeing this page. So.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000
We're gonna go through this together. We're gonna look at these questions and what I'd like to know first.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.000
Hey, before.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.000
You've seen this page before? Okay. Where have you seen this page before?

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000
When I had to contact the VA in Detroit.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:07.000
Okay, yeah, you were contacting the VA in Detroit. And how were you getting in touch with the VA in Detroit?

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000
Through the VA. Gov.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:15.000
Okay, so you went on via.gov. Do you remember where you went after that to find the right place?

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:29.000
I pushed the Detroit VA. It sent me to the Detroit page and then I message them because I have 2 different medical teams down there.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:43.000
And then they sent me this to fill out because they don't have my stuff on file down there because I'm associated with the Saginaw VA.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.000
Yeah.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:52.000
Okay, so this is looking familiar to you from your experience of the Detroit BA. So, you know, we're looking at this and there's a lot of questions here and I'd like to know if any questions stands out to you.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000
Number.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:59.000
So I'm gonna go slowly. Social Security number, let's look at that one.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000
Why is that stand out?

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000
Cause this is, this is gonna go to a general mailbox.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000
Okay, so what does that mean?

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:16.000
So a lot of people are gonna see this information. It's not gonna go to a specific. Person or department.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
Right, okay. Why do you think the VA asks for your Social Security number here?

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000
So they can locate your file.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000
Yup.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000
Okay, so they're trying to identify you and There also it also has service number here. Do you know what I serve?

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000
That's the thing.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:37.000
It's the same. Okay, so would you give both or just one? Just one, okay.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.000
And

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000
Just one. No, the other. Prior to Vietnam, you had a service number.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:48.000
After Vietnam it was the social security number that you were recognized by.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.000
Right, okay, so that's why we have both options, but you only need to give one So.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000
Yeah, could post Vietnam not free.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000
That makes sense. So.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000
It was my data service number.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:07.000
Okay. And you had some hesitation about giving your social security number, particularly because you think a lot of people are gonna see this information.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:17.000
Is there another number or another unique identifier that you would prefer to give?

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:24.000
A lot of people ask for your last name initial and then the last word of your social security number.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:30.000
Okay. So you were, you feel more comfortable giving the last 4 digits of your Social Security number.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000
Yeah, with the initial of my last name.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:40.000
Okay, that makes sense. Let's keep going. So now we've got we passed the Social Security and service number.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000
What's the next?

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:47.000
Information but it doesn't give your whole number and that way they can't.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000
Use it for any reason.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000
Yeah.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000
Yeah, it feels a bit more safe. I get that. What else are we seeing now?

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000
This is asking, how you want to be addressed. And I put my preferred name.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:12.000
Okay. You, your preferred name. Okay, so that's what you probably choose here. And then what about this one?

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:19.000
I see it. I would put woman because that's what I am, but a lot of people could, you know.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000
I get why they do that.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000
Yeah, okay. So.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000
But, and they wouldn't be able to do that.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:34.000
Alright, so for both pronouns and gender, it felt like you knew what you would choose.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:42.000
You would choose your preferred name and you would choose woman. And you kind of understand why they're asking for that, but.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000
It's also maybe a newer thing.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.000
Yeah.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:53.000
Yeah, it's new. If you did the non binary before 85. They would kick you out of the service.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:28:00.000
Yeah, definitely. So that's really helpful insight. So we're gonna pretend like we filled out this whole page.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000
We clicked. You know, preferred name, woman, and then we're gonna click continue, okay?

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000
Okay.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:12.000
Alright, so. Can you describe this page to me?

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.000
Oh.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:26.000
Oh, it tells me what. A. Health Facility that I'm attached to.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:34.000
Which I would put Saginaw. But. If I'm sending this to.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.000
Like say, because I have to do a lot of stuff out of Ann Arbor, cause they wanna keep.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:49.000
False contact with my cardiologist. Then I put I'd still have to put Saginaw because that's where my records are capped.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:29:01.000
Okay, so. They're asking for your health facility and you would put Saginaw. Would you so it looks like it says search by name and it also says search by location.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000
Which one would you use to put Saginaw?

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000
I do search by location.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.000
And you type in Saginaw?

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.000
Right, okay, so.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000
Yeah, cause all VAs have a different name. Just go by location.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000
Okay, so search by name if you had to search by name, what would you put in here?

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000
Alita.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000
Okay.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000
Is the first name. I can't remember the rest of it.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:31.000
So you try and remember, but it's a lot easier for you to go off of the location, which is Saginaw.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000
Right.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:39.000
Okay, that makes sense. So we can't unfortunately type in this today. Otherwise we might try and type in Saginaw.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.000
But if we did use your location, it would say city, state, or postal code.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000
And it sounds like you'd put in Saginaw. Today we're going to use search by name and what we're going to do is we're going to pretend like your facility starts with the word James.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:30:00.000
Instead of Elena. So we'll type in James. And now what are we seeing here?

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000
We're seeing 5 or 6 different.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000
Places. Or people.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:15.000
Okay. And so if your facility was called James J. Peters, What would you do here?

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000
You'll just have to describe it to me.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000
I click on James J. Peters.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.000
Yep, the New York.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000
You'd click on this one. Okay. Alright, we'll click on that.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000
What are we seeing now?

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000
Continue.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.000
Continue. Okay, so we see that it's selected so we can continue. Okay, let's do that.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000
We'll continue.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000
All right, before we look at this page, how much longer do you think this form is going to be?

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.000
Hopefully not much longer.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000
Yeah.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000
So.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:59.000
I don't know why they don't put everything on one page. Like your phone number and your name goes with your email and.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.000
Stuff like, on one page.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.000
Yes.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:11.000
Yeah, so it feels. Do you think this is making it feel longer? Do, are you surprised they're asking for your phone number and email right now?

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000
Nope.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Okay, so it feels like the right time to ask. But you kind of wish that it was with the name and everything else.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
Yeah, everything was on one page. Thank you.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:31.000
Okay, that makes sense. Yeah. And is there any way for us to know how much longer the form will be?

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:38.000
Well, it says 3 or 4 personal information.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.000
Yeah, so how many?

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.000
Okay, what the next page asks you.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.000
Yeah.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.000
It depends on the next page asks you. Okay. And on this page, does this look pretty straightforward to fill in?

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000
Yeah.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:32:00.000
Okay. Alright, we'll go ahead and pretend like we typed in your phone and email and we're gonna click continue.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:07.000
And without clicking anything yet, what, pay, which option would you choose?

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000
I always choose phone.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:15.000
You always choose phone. Okay. So you always prefer to talk to someone on the phone. You'd rather that they call you.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.000
Yeah.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000
Yeah.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000
Or text, you said? Okay. So for today, I know you would choose phone.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:30.000
We're actually going to choose US mail. This is just mostly so we can test the website, okay?

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.000
Okay.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:37.000
So we're pretending like you prefer to be contacted in the mail. And we're gonna click continue.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000
But you know, it really don't matter because they still contact you in all 3 ways.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:47.000
Okay, so you feel like your contact preference won't actually be. Followed anyways.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:54.000
No, cause I usually get a phone call and then I get an email and then I get a letter, then I get a text.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000
Subject.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000
Right. So even if you put in phone, you think that they might.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:05.000
Email you, they might mail you something. They might even text you. Right, that's helpful to know.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000
Yes.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:14.000
Okay, so now we're putting in it looks like our country where you receive mail. Can you describe?

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000
This page to me, what are you seeing here?

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:30.000
They want to know if. You're in the military where If you're outside of the country, you either have an FPO or an APL, that makes a big difference.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000
Or if you're in country they want to know what state you're in.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:41.000
But state you're in, okay, so it's either you're out of the country and it's an API or an FPO.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.000
Right.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000
Or it's asking for your state. Okay, so what would you click on? You'll have to just tell me.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.000
The state.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.000
You click on the state. Okay, so I'm gonna open that.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000
United States.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:59.000
Now what are we seeing? Okay, so we'll click on United States. And then we'll click continue.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000
Yep.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000
Okay. Alright. And now we're on this page.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:11.000
Hello, this could be on the same page as your contact info with the phone number and the email.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000
Okay, so it should be phone number, email, and mailing address altogether.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.000
Yup, and then at the bottom, how do, how do you want contact?

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.000
Okay, that makes sense. Do you think that would save you time?

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000
Save time and save everybody a lot of energy.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:33.000
Energy too, okay, that's helpful. So now we're looking at this page and it's asking for your mailing address.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:39.000
Is there anything that stands out to you besides the fact that it's on its own page?

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.000
No.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:50.000
Okay, so this looks pretty standard. Okay, so we'll pretend like we typed in your street address and everything else and then we'll click continue.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000
And what's this page asking for?

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:06.000
It's asking for a proper address because sometimes You put in your address. And the VA shows the last 4 digits.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:13.000
Of the zip code. So it gets to the precise location of where you're at.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:22.000
Okay, so this is something you've seen before on another form and you would, would you usually choose the suggestion it sounds like?

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:28.000
I usually choose what I entered.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.000
No.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.000
Okay, you usually choose what you entered. You don't take their suggestion. Okay, so you would switch this and you would click what you entered.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:37.000
I can't do that today, but we'll pretend like we did and I'll click continue.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000
Okay.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:45.000
Alright, so now how much longer do you think this form is gonna be?

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000
This is the end, but it's not going to be.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:53.000
This is the end. Okay, but it's not going to be you think there'll be another couple of pages

00:35:53.000 --> 00:36:00.000
Yes, because you gotta Go with the category of the topic of question you want to ask. And then you gotta go with your question.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:08.000
Then you gotta add more personal information that they've already asked you in the last 3 pages. And then you submit the question.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:15.000
Okay, so this is gonna ask for a little bit more from each of these sections.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000
You're repeating some information.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:25.000
Okay, right. That makes sense. So I'm gonna what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna click on category and topic.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:30.000
The military. This is right up that alley, cause they do that a lot.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000
Yeah, the military. What can you tell me what they do a lot?

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:43.000
They ask you repeatedly. The same questions over and over again. So if you're filling out a form, you get the first page filled out.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:53.000
You go to the second page, you got a little bit of new information to fill out. Then as you're getting down the page, you gotta answer the same information that you answered on the first page.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.000
And it continues and it can.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:01.000
Gotcha. Right. So your experience in the military.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.000
Is that you will have to repeat yourself and now you feel like that's what's gonna happen on this page.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000
Right, because you are, cause it says personal information.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:16.000
Yeah, that makes sense. All right, let's click on category and topic and we'll see, what happens.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:23.000
So what just happened? What are we seeing now?

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000
Okay.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000
Healthcare or ideology. There's another thing you need to put on here.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000
Yeah, what's that?

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000
Vision and. Dental.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:37.000
Oh, okay. So you think there should be a couple more options at this point?

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000
If you wanna do hearing, you might as well do dental and vision.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000
Okay. Why does it say hearing? Here.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.000
Where does that come from?

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000
Just hearing is a lot of issues with a lot of veterans.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:57.000
Huh. Is there a reason that we're seeing health care and hearing right now?

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000
Yeah, because hearing is 98% of veterans issues.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.000
Okay, so we're seeing it because it's a really common problem.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000
Right, but so is vision and so is dental.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:14.000
Right, okay. Yeah, I can see that. So let's click on your question next and we'll look at this one, okay?

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000
Okay.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000
So tell me what you're seeing here.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:28.000
Okay, it says, what is your question about? Did that so this is kind of redundant.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:43.000
The reason you're contacting us is I have a question which is kind of redundant because that's what you clicked when you first started into all this.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.000
Okay.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.000
And then it says I wanna have my hearing checked, which, yeah, that's good. But not have we done it because that was answered in the first page too.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:54.000
Right, okay. So you already answered these questions. So why is it showing up? Again, here.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000
I don't know, but that's kind of weird.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:08.000
Yeah, okay. That makes sense. I can see how that's a little weird. So we're gonna click on personal information now.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000
I already answered all this.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:15.000
Alright, so, You already answered all this? Okay, I'll keep scrolling and we'll see if there's anything.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000
Else we're noticing.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.000
Now if you do the social security number, you don't need the data.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000
Huh. Okay.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000
Especially when it's going to a general mailbox. And I'd still prefer to have my J and then my last 4.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:34.000
Instead of the whole self security number.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000
Right. Yeah, I hear you.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000
Cause that's a VA identifier. And it gets

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:44.000
That makes sense. Okay.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:51.000
Even out of state VAs ask for my identifier, which is my J and then my last floor.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:57.000
Right, yeah, so Definitely still concerned about giving your full Social Security number. That makes sense.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:04.000
Well, here's the problem. Somebody used my cell security number to get a job in Utah.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000
Oh no, yeah.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:19.000
Oh yeah, so now I'm in the middle of Getting that straightened out because Social Security has decided they're going to cut my SSI benefits because I was working in 2,022.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:27.000
Oh gosh, what a mess. So that experience has made you even more cautious about having to give your social security number.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.000
And my birthday because any you can they have they can do that.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:43.000
Yeah, that makes sense. I can totally see why that would, you'd be. Wary of typing it in this form.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.000
Yep, we answered all this stuff.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.000
So there's also a few other things we've got medical facility information. We already answered all this stuff, right?

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000
Okay. Can we change any of this stuff?

00:40:49.000 --> 00:41:00.000
Thank you. Not really, cause we've already done all this. Now if they say what this should be, what this page should be.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:09.000
If the information you gave us, should we change anything?

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.000
Right.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000
Okay, so it should be. Kind of a chance for you to check your answers. Right, okay, and it doesn't feel like it's like that right now.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.000
Yeah.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000
No, although it says that you're going down.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:24.000
Everything one step at a time, but if you had everything on one thing and then it said Edit, then you can go up and change what you want.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:31.000
Instead of having to go through this whole page.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.000
Okay, I'm gonna click on edit so we can see what that looks like, okay?

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000
Okay.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.000
Alright, so what are we seeing now?

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:44.000
Same where I can change my number or my email contact.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:52.000
Okay. Is this is this working differently to how you want it to work?

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000
No, it's the usual.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:00.000
Yeah, it's the usual, okay. So now that we found the edit button, maybe this page makes more sense.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.000
But it wasn't easy to spine.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.000
Yeah. I do, but here's what I'm seeing.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000
Yeah.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:15.000
All of this to be on one thing. So when you push the edit button. Everything pops up and you can change everything at once.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.000
Right, okay, you don't wanna have to go through sections.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:26.000
No, cause I have a I have condition called packs Pasture or theesthetic techicardia syndrome?

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:34.000
The longer I sit down at a computer to do this. There's a chance that when I stand up, I'm going to pass out.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:39.000
Right, okay, so it's important for you that this happens much more quickly than it's happened.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.000
Right.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:46.000
And, and that's also present here on this page. You wish you could edit. Everything at once instead of going through sections.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.000
Right.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:52.000
That makes sense. So. Can we edit this one? It says, how should we contact you US mail?

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000
Can we edit that?

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000
Edit mailing address.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.000
Oh, okay. So we click edit down here. Right, okay.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:09.000
Right. The other problem.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:16.000
Alright, so I'm gonna give you a second to read this page and then I'd love for you to tell me what you learned from this page.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:24.000
Thanks to me for asking the question and that somebody will be in contact with me and I better write down that reference number.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:31.000
So if I need to get back with them. I have a way to get to the question I asked them.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:40.000
Okay. So the reference number is important for you to remember. So you're gonna write it down on a notepad or how are you gonna remember that?

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.000
Okay.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000
I'm gonna write it down. And, my hand at the time that I'm doing this.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:49.000
That makes sense. Alright, is there anything else you learned from this page?

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.000
That it's the end.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:44:02.000
It's the end, yeah. How, what's your next step besides writing down your reference number?

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.000
Yeah, you close it out.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.000
Okay.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:11.000
I close it out. For them to get back to me. Unless of course it's more important than I call the VA and tell them what I did.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:17.000
That way they can.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.000
Yeah.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:23.000
Yeah, help you sooner. Okay, how long do you think it's gonna take to get a response with your answer?

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:29.000
Usually with my VA in S and my health issues, it takes 2 to 3 days.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.000
Okay, so you're hoping it takes about 2 to 3 days.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:39.000
I've had friends that, it's taken longer. It's taken less time.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:48.000
Depending on because my friend with cancer her doctor gets back to her within one to 2 days.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.000
And then.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.000
Gotcha. Okay. So I'm gonna stop sharing my screen and we can keep talking for the last few minutes, okay?

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000
Okay, and then I have a friend whose doctor gets back to him in 2 to 3 weeks.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.000
Okay, so you're

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:04.000
Because they're medical issues, there's just. They only see the VA once a year, so.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:12.000
So when it's more urgent or it's somebody that has more urgent needs, then you're expecting it to be sooner.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.000
Right.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:26.000
That totally makes sense and I think that definitely makes sense in terms of health care especially. Remember when we thought about like a general question, like what if it was a general question you had about a law that had just been passed?

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:31.000
How would that change your expectations?

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:37.000
Well, I would expect within the next 7 to 14 days.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.000
Unless it's directly affecting my medical.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:48.000
Okay. Yeah. And when we think about this process, we didn't sign in at the beginning, right?

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.000
We just continued without signing in.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.000
Right. That's why I was concerned about Social Security number.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:57.000
Right. So if you signed in, how do you think it would be different? What would be different.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.000
I wouldn't know my social security number. They'd know who I was.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000
Yeah, you wouldn't have to give the Social Security number. What other information?

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:11.000
No, And they'd have my birthday already and they'd have my address.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.000
They'd have my email and they'd have my phone number.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000
Yeah. So they'd have a lot of your information already.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:21.000
So. Right, all I would have to do is ask my question.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:28.000
Okay. Would you need to review the information they have about you or would you just expect them to have?

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:33.000
The right information and you don't need to even see it.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.000
I resume my information every 3 months with the VA.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:44.000
Okay, so you expect that it's up to date. So really your expectation is I sign in and then I ask you my question.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.000
Right.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.000
Right.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000
Yeah, so this feels quite different to that. Okay. I can definitely see some things that could be easier and could make this a lot faster.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:47:02.000
It was really helpful for you. To explain things that you think should come together on one page.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:11.000
Yeah, if you can condense them all the one page, one grouping. Because it's all the same.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:20.000
Basically, you put it all on one page. Then, it cuts time and People aren't as frustrated.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:26.000
Yeah. That makes sense. I can see why that has that.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.000
Effect.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.000
You've ever been in the military. You would truly understand.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:37.000
Yeah, I'm sure. Well, that's why it's been so helpful for me to chat with you today.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:42.000
That's why veterans get frustrated with the VA because it's a lot of redundancy.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:53.000
A lot of redundancy for sure. That makes sense. Hi, I've asked you a ton of questions, Brenda, and I think you've answered all of them.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.000
Oh, you're welcome and sorry about the delay.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000
So thank you so much for for doing that. Oh, it's not your fault at all.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000
I think these

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.000
Yes, I got the crazy cat. That's my

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:11.000
Well, yeah, I guess it's the cat's fault, but, I appreciate you getting yourself set up this morning and then working with me to kind of like come up with a backup plan.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:16.000
I do want to give you a last couple of minutes to ask me any questions. Do you have any questions for me?

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.000
No, everything was straightforward, so I understand what you're doing.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000
Okay, awesome. Well, I really.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:26.000
Okay, what computer lit thanks for the Navy, so.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:33.000
Yeah, no, you, you definitely were really helpful. All of your feedback was, useful and you noticed a lot of things that other veterans might not notice.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:40.000
Or that I didn't notice myself. So I really appreciate your time. Paragian, they're the people who set up this research session.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:53.000
They're going to send you a note when we finish and it's gonna have some information that you can pass along to other veterans if they want to take part in.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.000
Awesome.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:59.000
Thank you. I share. I know a couple of friends that. Like to do this so I share.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:08.000
Oh good, that's great. Well, I think that's all for me if you have any other questions you can email, pair of, and they'll, they'll get back to you real quick.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:13.000
And I hope you have a lovely rest of your day.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.000
Awesome. Well, thank you so much.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.000
Oh, thank you and I really appreciate what you're doing. What? In these accounts.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.000
Awesome. Thank you, Brenda. Have a good one.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:24.000
You tooBye
