## Transcript

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.450

Becky: So I've started the recording. And I'd like to confirm again, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

> P3: Yes.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:16.500

Becky: Alrighty, thank you.

Becky: Great. So we'll get started by learning more about your experience in general with VA and our online services. So first off, how long have you been a Veteran?

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.589

> P3: Oh, goodness was active, started active duty in 1983 and separated at 92.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:47.329

Becky: Amazing. And have you ever contacted VA online or over the phone? As you've interacted with VA?

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.090

> P3: Many times.

Becky: Interesting, was it online or over the phone?

> P3: Yes, many times.

Becky: Oh, both of them, both options?

> P3: Yeah.

> P3: I use the video chat with telehealth and the secure email secure messaging, I guess.

Becky: Gotcha. Oh, so you're saying you've also used video chat, too.

> P3: Yeah. Might have a lot of appointments that way. It's just works out easier for me.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.339

Becky: Got it What are some other times that you've contacted the VA outside of those appointments?

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:38.549

> P3: Well, again, you're mostly on the phone using the automated pharmacy system and speaking directly with the pharmacist or technician.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.07

Becky: Got it. So sounds like you have a lot of experience contacting VA.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.120

> P3: Yes.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:53.420

Becky: Great. So it was really helpful to just learn a little bit about your experience with VA.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.320

Becky: Next, I'm going to share some ideas through our prototype to get your feedback.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.030

Becky: So in the chat I'm going to send you a link to the prototype and make sure that's copied... and I mentioned earlier that a prototype is just like a test version of a website. So again, it's not gonna work perfectly. But that's way we can learn what we need to improve before we share it out with folks at large.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.819

Becky: Alright. So I'm going to send you this link right now in the Zoom chat.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.129

Becky: Let me know when you've opened it.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.650

> P3: Okay, it's open.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.709

Becky: all right. Now my next question is, have you ever shared your screen on Zoom before.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.280

> P3: I don't think we've ever had a reason to before.

002:49.520 --> 00:02:53.829

Becky: Would you need some help walking through how to share your screen right now?

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.170

> P3: Well, I don't see anything that says to share it. Is that on the main screen?

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.920

Becky: Yeah. So right at the bottom of your zoom screen. You should either see an icon that says, share screen, and it's green. Or it might also be hidden under more. Which is, should also be at the bottom of your screen next to the end button.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.080

> P3: Oh, there's the share screen. Okay?

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.490

Becky: And you should see some different options. They'll just want to share the window the prototype that I just sent you.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.170

> P3: Okay.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.630

> P3: I've selected that and share that work.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:58.710

Becky: Yes, amazing.

> P3: You 't teach an old dog new tricks.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:08.180

Becky: I always get nervous. Trying to walk someone through something when like I cannot see their screen. But I'm glad that worked out.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.090
> P3: I was a programmer for a while at state of [state]. So yeah, I understand talking people through things.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.100

Becky: For sure.

Becky: It's it's definitely a skill. So that's awesome. We can see your screen right now all right. And we're on the start page.

Becky: And we're not gonna click on anything just yet. But I'm gonna give you a moment to take a look at this page and as you're looking through it, can you tell me what jumps out to you? What you notice first.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.320

> P3: Well, the sign in basically. Because that's the main thing that we usually look to when we go to these sites.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.590

Becky: And what makes it jump out at you.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.280

> P3: It's helpful that it's contrasting colors. I usually do things on dark mode. So if this were available in dark mode, the green would not show up very well. It would need to have some kind of other contrast.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:20.439

Becky: Yeah, it's interesting to hear that from your different perspective and how you use dark mode.

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.909

> P3: Yeah, it's just easier on my eyes.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:29.160

> P3: I normally wear glasses, but I have things set up at the point and normal people use, you know, normal size screens for their computer. So I'm using an older 48 inch TV as my monitor.

> P3: I see I'm sitting about arms length away from it. So that gives me little better vision. Everything is little bit larger which helps on my eyes. And if I need to, I can zoom in on things or increase the zoom on it enough to make things larger and easier to read.

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:09.110

Becky: Yeah, that's really helpful to understand. And you know, as you can see on the page, there are lots of other things and understanding that you're on this larger screen, and that you need to zoom in. Is there anything else that stands out to you right now as you're scrolling through?

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:23.469

> P3: Not really. The the main thing that stands out is something that is not there, and I've complained about on several occasions is the fact that VA sites like this, where there's a sign in or create account. There is never anything that says, 'Remember this device.' There have been times where I've had to log in multiple times during the day and every time I got to wait on that doggone secure access code verification code, whatever you want to call it it to me that.

> P3: I mean, this is a desktop computer. I'm not taking it anywhere. I'm mobility challenged. I don't go many places for me. That kind of stuff, not being able to have it. Just click it to sign in. Remember this device. You've gone through all this before. It's been verified. Everything has been done codes have been sent back and forth, entered, whatever needs to happen. And like, I said, sometimes multiple times during the day, and yet

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.130

> P3: it I still have to do it.

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:39.160

> P3: I mean. there are so many other

79
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:41.620
> P3: websites that

80
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:43.659
> P3: if once you verify it.

81
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:52.139
> P3: you can remember it says, Remember the device, or remember me or do not challenge anymore that type of thing.

82
00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:56.690
> P3: And yet Va doesn't seem to want to follow that protocol.

83
00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:08.680
Becky: Yeah, it's helpful to hear your experience just on other va websites and compare it to what you're seeing right now. So that's really interesting to hear

84
00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:33.679
Becky: great. So for the rest of this conversation. I'm gonna give you scenario. So I'd like you to pretend that you need to ask via a question. And let's say the question is around you recently noticing some problems with your hearing. And so you want to ask via how you can get your hearing checked by an audio by an audiologist.

85
00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:38.280
Becky: So without clicking anything just yet, can you tell me what you do first?

86
00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:40.020
> P3: Well.

87
00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:43.119
> P3: normally I'd have to sign in. But

88
00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:47.119
> P3: first place, I'd look would probably be at the Va. Benefits and healthcare

89
00:08:48.590 --> 00:09:02.400
> P3: interesting. And why would you? Look at that part? I'm assuming you're talking about that via benefits and healthcare menu at the top. Yeah, at the top left. I already know what location I'm assigned to. So that's not an issue.

90
00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:07.760
> P3: I know a little bit enough about the Va. So not gonna worry about that.

91
00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:16.829
> P3: But since I'm looking for some type of service and care. I would look under health care. That would be my first choice.

92
00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:24.340
> P3: I would do that, and if I didn't see anything in the dropdown that might lead me to that, then I would just try and search.

93
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:33.290
Becky: Got it. So it sounds like you'd go topic first and then land on some sort of page like this.

94
00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:37.039
> P3: Yeah, most of the times when I call to ask a question.

95
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:41.949
> P3: it's while I'm on hold. I'm going through the website.

96
00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:49.949
> P3: And there have been a number of times where I found what I was looking for before someone on the other end picked up the phone.

97
00:09:51.180 --> 00:10:06.720
> P3: Got? It? Sounds like you're trying to proactively do that research, while your your feel safe is also getting to talk to someone, too. There, like, I say, there's been times where I saw. I have no idea what I'm looking for. But I'm on the website.

98
00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:11.539
> P3: and while I'm there I kind of take a quick look at it and go. Oh.

99
00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:21.150
> P3: crap! I have no idea. So did I make the phone call, because I know that's gonna take a few minutes. and if at all possible, I will not call on a Monday or Friday.

100
00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:27.730
Becky: Got it? Yeah, it's interesting to hear your your approach here to the scenario

101
00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:35.190
> P3: like I said previous it experience, I understand, probably a little bit better than some folks do. But

102
00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:41.580
> P3: that doesn't mean I'm gonna get anything done quicker than anybody else. I just know that at some point

103
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:52.580
> P3: they're gonna say, well, you can look on the website. And it even says so in the messages while I'm waiting on the phone. you know. So it's like, Yeah, I'm already there. Get somebody. I want a person

104
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:53.660
> P3: type of thing.

105
00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:58.100
Becky: Yeah, for sure. You're relying on that past experience. Yeah.

106
00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:02.550
> P3: Arguing with the robot is fun

107
00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:08.640
> P3: gets me through my day. But since I'm out of coffee and drinking my lemon water now.

108
00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:11.940
> P3: yes, for sure.

109
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:24.670
Becky: Alright! Let's let's do it through this prototype. We we talked through your approach as to how you'd start approaching the scenario where again, you need to ask me how to get your hearing checked.

110
00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:30.019
Becky: So if you scroll down go ahead and click. Continue without signing in.

111
00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.709
> P3: I don't see it continue. Oh, there it is!

112
00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:52.860
> P3: Yes, it seems like that was difficult for you to find, so we'll we'll note that down. I mean, they could be the same size, or even sign in or create account. Continue without signing in. Put them on the same line.

113
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:55.930
> P3: That's where these old eyes are looking, anyway.

114
00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:58.620
Becky: definitely.

115
00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:10.829
Becky:  alright. So I'll repeat the scenario. One more time. You're asking the how to get your hearing checked so can you show me what you do first on the page

116
00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:14.460
category? Here

117
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:29.449
we know healthcare.

118
00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:36.370
Becky: Alright. So you just chose health care. And now you're on this page.

119
00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:41.479
Becky: Now, can you show me what you do on on this one, and what you would select

120
00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:51.050
Becky: right there at the top is audiology and hearing needs. So oh, actually, are you speaking right now? Your audio might be a little muted

121
00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:52.760
Becky: if you're covering your mic

122
00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:54.050
to change it.

123
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:59.240
Becky: Oh, yes, it's very hard to hear you right now

124
00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:02.900
and see

125
00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:07.600
> P3: phone access is on.

126
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.340
Becky: Alright, I think you said, and relying on the live transcript, you said the access is on.

127
00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:22.130
> P3: Yeah, everything. Should. I? Haven't changed anything since we began talking.

128
00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:29.760
Becky: Hmm! Have you? Maybe moved away from your screen at all, or maybe something got unplugged

129
00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:30.909
right here.

130
00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:38.149
> P3: I brought my light back down. I noticed my camera's not on. So because I'm not doing video.

131
00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.990
So I don't need to have my face lit up

132
00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:45.180
Becky: alright. Yeah, it's it's fine to not have your video on. It's

133
00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:48.770
> P3: a little interesting how your

134
00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:52.069
Becky: your sound is just very muted right now.

135
00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:53.329
Oh, well.

136
00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:59.450
Becky: yeah, I'm gonna maybe mute and then unmute you and see if that helps.

137
00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.409
That. Was that

138
00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:11.790
Becky: all right, you're still pretty faint.

139
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:19.999
Becky: Alright. Let me just try turning up my volume and can you say something again.

140
00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:22.550
Sure. Passed one, too.

141
00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:30.230
Becky: Okay, you're still pretty faint, but I can still hear you, so we can. We can go ahead and still keep going. It's it's totally fine.

142
00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:35.510
> P3: Yeah, we'll work with this technical challenge. There are volume setting on my side.

143
00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:41.030
> P3: By turning the microphone up a little bit.

144
00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.759
Becky: Yeah, I'm not sure if there's a volume setting on your side.

145
00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:51.440
Becky: Still the same volume. But I think we're we're okay to keep going.

146
00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:56.140
Becky: Alright.

147
00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:59.189
Becky: So we're

148
00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:05.269
Becky: reviewing. Very well, we're on the screen. I asked you what you do on this page, and can you walk me through your choice here?

149
00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:11.010
> P3: Okay, well as just as I scroll down. It's asking, since I'm in the healthcare category

150
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:19.790
> P3: topic that best describes my question would be right at the top the Audiology and hearing aids. Since I'm looking at some hearing issues

151
00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:25.489
Becky: audit. And how do you think this question is different from the last one you just answered.

152
00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:35.709
> P3:  this one is helping drill down and be more specific, whereas the others was just general.

153
00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:38.389
> P3: why are you here? Type thing?

154
00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:47.950
Becky: Okay? Yeah, that that makes sense to me. It's a more specific topic for lack of a better word to healthcare.

155
00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:48.880
> P3: Right?

156
00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:53.049
> P3: That's I treat these like a filter, I mean.

157
00:15:54.240 --> 00:16:02.930
> P3: rather than being on the main page and trying to do a search for hearing test. It's like, Well, I don't have out of all the other choices.

158
00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:10.810
> P3: Nothing was dealing with healthcare or making a medical appointment type of deal for testing. So

159
00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:18.670
> P3: drill down. And then, when you, as that continues, then all that other stuff is removed from the page, and

160
00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.650
> P3: we're left with these topics.

161
00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:38.499
> P3: Got it? Yeah, sounds like that. Categorization is more helpful than trying to do it at the top from your perspective. how to drill down through a website using Boolean language or Boolean search queries.

162
00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:47.679
> P3: yeah, sorry. Find your category. It's like.

163
00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:54.409
> P3: yeah, I want a hearing test. So I'm gonna go look at X-rays. That's not gonna get me anywhere. So

164
00:16:55.560 --> 00:17:01.300
Becky: what does that make sense to me? Let's go ahead and click. Continue over to the next page

165
00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:10.310
Becky: alright, and take a moment to to view this page. Can you show me what you do here.

166
00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:17.030
Question about

167
00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:30.860
those 3 really don't fit what I would want. I'm not looking at Va. Benefits

168
00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.119
> P3: because I know I'm already eligible.

169
00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:40.680
> P3: I'm not looking for someone else's Va. Benefits my situation. I'm the only veteran in the household.

170
00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:42.110
and

171
00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:47.200
> P3: it's a general question doesn't fit because I want audiology testing.

172
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:51.690
> P3: So I have a specific question, not a general.

173
00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:53.550
Becky: Umhm.

174
00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:57.230
Becky: Yeah. So in this case,

175
00:17:57.290 --> 00:18:02.180
Becky: after going through all the options which one would you still choose in this scenario

176
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:08.089
> P3: under these 3 conditions or 3 variables, I would say it's a general question

177
00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:10.750
Becky: on it.

178
00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:21.069
Becky: Alright, and just taking a pause here in the middle of the form, too. I do want to ask, how much longer do you think this form is right now?

179
00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:25.530
> P3: Well, since we're on question 2 of 4

180
00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:28.269
several pages already.

181
00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:35.970
> P3: Usually, whatever Va. Says, I multiply it by 3, and

182
00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:39.449
in the ballpark. so I'm hoping

183
00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:42.049
> P3: maybe less than 12 pages to go.

184
00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:51.080
Becky: Got it. So it sounds like just from your experience with Va, you're expecting this to last a bit longer.

185
00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:54.350
> P3: And to me.

186
00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:58.419
> P3: this type of thing up here 2 or 4. Your question

187
00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.090
that's useless. meaningless.

188
00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:07.359
Becky: That's real. That's coming from an it perspective.

189
00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:08.430
A

190
00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:13.630
> P3: normal veteran, if there is such a thing.

191
00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:17.679
would look, they would expect.

192
00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:19.749
> P3: Okay, I've got 3 more questions.

193
00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:22.130
Becky:  right?

194
00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:25.579
> P3: But they may or may not have realized that they've already

195
00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:28.280
clicked 3, or 4 times

196
00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:32.169
to get to this 2 of 4.

197
00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:34.430
So

198
00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:41.039
> P3: either, the counting here, is wrong. Someone's trying to use new math and it isn't working

199
00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:44.969
> P3:  it's irrelevant.

200
00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:53.160
Becky: Yeah, it's it's really interesting that you've picked up on our progress bar at the top to

201
00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:57.039
Becky: to think about your expectations for filling out the rest of the form.

202
00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:04.979
It's like, I say, this is some things that I used to do. I was in charge of the Lighthe program

203
00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:08.560
5 years.

204
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:18.550
> P3: and I'm the one that converted all the reporting over to electronic. And I could run you through an entire scenario. But we don't really have the time for that. If you want to finish on time.

205
00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:21.649
> P3: but suffice it to say that

206
00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:22.660
okay.

207
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.160
> P3: their headquarters person.

208
00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:36.960
> P3: one of the secretaries, would drive personal vehicle over to ours. Location once a week on Fridays, pick up all the reports from that previous week, take them back to the headquarters.

209
00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:41.249
> P3: break them all down, and then mail them out to the different offices.

210
00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:55.489
Becky: Yeah, sounds like that. That past experience with the I think you said the lighting program and and it has helped. You understand the bogus bar a little bit more income

211
00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:57.740
home energy assistance program.

212
00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.350
Becky: Got it.

213
00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:00.470
So

214
00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:03.439
> P3: yeah, that it wound up. Being nice, I

215
00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:07.260
> P3: managed to get all the reports to the office servers

216
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:09.680
that night.

217
00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:14.940
> P3: and II tweaked the system, created new files and

218
00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:23.440
formats and all kinds of different things like I said I could. I could spend a weekend talking about it. But

219
00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:31.349
> P3: their administrator told me, she said she just guesstimating that I've saved them over a million dollars worth of effort.

220
00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:40.290
> P3: because now everything else, the other gal is not having to drive over in her personal vehicle, which is not covered under work, related

221
00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:46.990
activities. If you were to have an accident. you know. God forbid she got hurt, maimed, or killed.

222
00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:53.209
> P3: Benefits could be denied to her family because she wasn't doing it.

223
00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:58.149
What was expected. She was doing something outside that scope.

224
00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:08.149
Becky: Yeah, you know, as I've also worked in local government. And II totally relate to that, too.

225
00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:25.860
Becky: And moving us along here. For the sake of this scenario, too. On asking via how to get your hearing checked, we'll go ahead and choose my own benefits, which I know is not option you had originally thought to select. But we'll choose that option and then hit. Continue

226
00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:34.180
Becky: alright. Now, can you tell me what you do on this page and and walk me through what you're thinking, too?

227
00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:35.350
Okay?

228
00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:41.659
> P3: Again. focusing on the progress bar, we're still at 2 of 4.

229
00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:43.010
So

230
00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:48.179
> P3: if I were to have other issues, I'd be getting upset with that, because

231
00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:50.369
I mean, we've gone from

232
00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:53.540
> P3: an annoyance to misleading to now lying.

233
00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:56.529
Becky: So that was a trust issue.

234
00:22:57.130 --> 00:22:57.890
Hmm.

235
00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:04.189
> P3: but select the reason we're questioning. I have a question. I want to say something nice

236
00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:10.949
like suggestion tended. Oh. I want to say something else.

237
00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:13.150
Hmm!

238
00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:27.129
I guess it would be. I have a question cause. I'm still trying to get the Audiology in a hearing test, find out what needs to be done.

239
00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:40.369
Becky: Right? So it sounds like you choose. I have a question since you yeah, the hearing you need to get your hearing checked, and you need to find out what needs to be done.

240
00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:41.600
Right?

241
00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:53.670
Becky: Hey? Let's go ahead and click. Continue over to the next page and same thing. Take a second to look at this. And can you tell me what you do next on this page, or what you notice, too.

242
00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:58.519
Again, the progress bar hasn't any time. So

243
00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:00.940
> P3: now I'm getting to the point where.

244
00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:03.639
> P3: since it's finally asking my question

245
00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:07.980
> P3: type in my question and then click continue. But

246
00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:13.210
I'm at the point where I'm becoming frustrated and not caring anymore. So

247
00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:18.199
Becky: got it. Yeah, it's really helpful to hear

248
00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:31.050
> P3: guess how your emotions have changed over the course of this form so far, it's really helpful to understand that. And how you're looking at the progress far, too.

249
00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:32.210
But

250
00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:38.099
> P3: I've been diagnosed with anger management issues. Mine's a little on the mild to moderate side.

251
00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:41.380
> P3: So folks that are coming in with

252
00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:45.799
> P3: more severe than that, and or Ptsd.

253
00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:48.700
> P3: They would have been done

254
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:50.360
long ago. They said.

255
00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:55.500
> P3: I won't use the language I would use, but it was. It would be at the point where

256
00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:59.880
screw this. I'm done. They're not gonna help me. BA, sucks.

257
00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:04.739
Becky:  and yeah, that would prevent someone from

258
00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:11.070
> P3: continuing to get the service that they desperately need. And that happens in a lot of situations.

259
00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:16.970
More often than not. It's the mental health aspect of it

260
00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:21.020
> P3: where they really need to be able to talk to someone, and

261
00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:22.830
> P3: they're unable to get there.

262
00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:24.390
Because by now.

263
00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:28.620
> P3: like I said, I'm just getting slightly frustrated, flustered.

264
00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:31.060
> P3: It's someone who has a serious need.

265
00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:33.130
> P3: they would have been done already.

266
00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:38.710
Becky: Hmm, yeah, it's really helpful to understand

267
00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:47.760
Becky: this other perspective, too. And really, how you know, design informs how you you react to a process?

268
00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:50.830
Becky: So that's really helpful to understand. Thank you.

269
00:25:50.990 --> 00:26:00.400
> P3: Just on a personal note. There were times when I needed to contact mental health services and the situation like this popped up.

270
00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:06.199
And I so it screw it. I'm done, and

271
00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:09.610
I've already had.

272
00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:12.170
> P3: I finally had someone

273
00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:19.129
> P3: there that II trusted, felt good about talking to her. and thought we were making progress.

274
00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:20.410
and

275
00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:22.880
> P3: she left, for whatever reason

276
00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:31.590
> P3: we were at the point where was, well, when you have a need. call me. I had a direct line to our office.

277
00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:35.639
> P3: I call that number one time, and it had been

278
00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:42.570
> P3: probably about 6 to 9 months after our last appointment, so I was doing pretty good, but I had some questions.

279
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:46.439
> P3: and that is when I found out oh, she just gone.

280
00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:49.690
I go. Okay. Well, then.

281
00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:52.199
> P3: who am I? Who am I transferred to?

282
00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:57.889
> P3: But we don't have anyone yet. You need to call the main office and set up an appointment and see who's available.

283
00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:13.930
Becky: Yeah, I can see how that can be. A very frustrating experience to, you know. Talk to someone, then have them not be there anymore. You know, understanding that, too. I'm really curious to

284
00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:21.760
Becky: hear your perspective on the rest of this form, too. So go ahead and click, continue, and we'll see what the rest of the form has.

285
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:30.180
Becky: Alright, taking a look at this question, why do you think Va is asking you for this information

286
00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:34.999
> P3: at this point, this late in the process, I have no idea.

287
00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:45.770
Becky: No, that's that's good feedback to hear. Let's let's choose. I'm the veteran and hit. Continue to move on to the next screen.

288
00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:50.529
Becky: Alright. And same question here. Why do you think the is asking you this

289
00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:54.469
again. No idea. I don't even see how it's relevant.

290
00:27:56.860 --> 00:28:03.359
Becky: Got it for the sake of the scenario. Let's go ahead and click no. and hit continue

291
00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:11.059
Becky: alright, and then we land on this page. So go ahead and scroll through. Take a look at what's on this page

292
00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:12.250
Becky: and

293
00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:16.809
Becky: let me know. Does anything stand out to you on this page?

294
00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:22.440
> P3: Yeah. Once again, they're asking social security number and birthday.

295
00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:27.680
> P3: And for God's sake, get rid of the pronouns.

296
00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:30.860
Actually.

297
00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:36.810
> P3: yeah, that right there would turn me

298
00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:39.020
on just about everything.

299
00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:47.660
> P3: My pronouns wouldn't matter even if I felt it matter.

300
00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:51.380
> P3: It's condescending.

301
00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:53.000
it's ridiculous.

302
00:28:54.150 --> 00:29:00.370
> P3: It's falling under the woke status that's become so much a part of the the community here.

303
00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:02.060
But

304
00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:05.200
> P3: It's like it shoved down our throat.

305
00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:11.220
and I'm personally tired of the 1% dictating to the 99%.

306
00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:13.680
Becky: Yeah, it's help.

307
00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:19.280
> P3: Like, I don't know you. You look like a guy I'm gonna call you. He

308
00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:28.829
> P3: if you come back and say I'm a woman, you call me a C. No, your voice is deeper than mine, and your Adam's apple is bigger than mine.

309
00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:31.920
> P3: I'm not playing that game.

310
00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.959
I don't care what your pronouns are.

311
00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:41.290
> P3: You're going to address me. You can say Mr. Peters, or Sir, or

312
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:44.779
okay. or hey, you! I don't care.

313
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.490
> P3: Expecting me to know what your pronouns are after ever having met you.

314
00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:53.480
> P3: We might as well are wrestle.

315
00:29:54.770 --> 00:30:03.590
Becky: Yeah, it's it's interesting to hear your reaction to the pronouns field the social security and service number fields.

316
00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:13.750
Becky: Thinking of all the fields on the page. Is there any information you wouldn't want to give to the Va. It sounds like maybe pronouns wouldn't be one form of information

317
00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:15.839
> P3: pronouns and gender identity.

318
00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:19.170
There are 2

319
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:21.529
> P3: male male and female

320
00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:23.960
> P3: man

321
00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:27.189
> P3: is not a gender. Woman is not a gender.

322
00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:31.350
It's just a classification. male and female.

323
00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.129
Becky: Got it. Those are 10

324
00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:44.650
Becky: awesome. No, that's helpful to understand. Just after your your reactions to seeing these 2 fields.

325
00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:55.499
Becky:  alright moving us along this personal information page again, you can't fill anything here. So we'll just pretend, like you filled in the information.

326
00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:57.870
Becky: And you can go ahead and click, continue.

327
00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:01.150
> P3: And one other thing on this

328
00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:06.330
> P3: we already have to fill out a profile when we create an account. So

329
00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:09.329
> P3: my login is tied to that profile.

330
00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:13.860
> P3: So why, they're asking for the profile. Information again

331
00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:15.690
seems kind of redundant.

332
00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:24.369
Becky: Got it. So it seems like it sounds redundant to you to ask for all this personal information again.

333
00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:25.470
Becky: Hmm.

334
00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:28.440
Becky: yeah, that makes sense to me

335
00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:33.739
> P3: like, I say, it just adds an extra click to now, we're, you know 3 or 4, but we've already

336
00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:35.749
2 or 3 times.

337
00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:42.929
Becky:  yeah, so it's so you include in on the the progress bar again.

338
00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:47.239
> P3: So far my math conversion was correct.

339
00:31:48.410 --> 00:31:52.479
Becky: right from the beginning. The 12 pages

340
00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:56.249
Becky: can you describe this page to me and what it's asking for?

341
00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.410
Yeah, my help facility

342
00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:03.820
Becky: got it. And what would you do first to search for your health facility.

343
00:32:04.670 --> 00:32:05.390
Well.

344
00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:09.500
> P3: I guess it depends on

345
00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:13.920
> P3: what it is there. Resuming, here am I.

346
00:32:14.650 --> 00:32:19.699
> P3: The thing that's confusing to this is okay. I already know what my healthcare facility is

347
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:22.629
so I don't need to search

348
00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:26.129
> P3: again. Be tied in with the profile.

349
00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:38.489
Becky: Got it so from your perspective. You already know what it is. So you're wondering why they're asking you to search for it right? I mean, II didn't. I'm not creating

350
00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:40.270
> P3: a new account.

351
00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:44.779
> P3: I'm not registering for the account. But I'm already part of the system.

352
00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:49.330
> P3: So again, why are we doing stuff

353
00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:53.559
that's already there should be available, linked into my profile?

354
00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:55.590
Becky: Hmm.

355
00:32:56.570 --> 00:33:00.359
Becky: yeah, that's helpful to understand. Where

356
00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:03.620
> P3: from the previous pages I could see using

357
00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:08.930
the social security number and the birth date in order to verify a profile.

358
00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:11.990
So

359
00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:14.480
> P3: I suppose.

360
00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:19.009
> P3: on specific occasions, that information could be valid to request.

361
00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:23.260
> P3: But once you're tied to the or once the profile is verified.

362
00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:32.309
all of this stuff has become redundant again. That's already part of the profile. That's that's what the profile is for.

363
00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:38.919
> P3: This is my name. This is my social security number. This is my birthday. This is my address.

364
00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:43.689
> P3: This was my rank. Here's my nickname, if you want to use it.

365
00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:48.269
> P3: This is where I'm seeing 100% of the time.

366
00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:55.190
Becky: Yeah, sounds like the sentiment is your sentiment is.

367
00:33:55.400 --> 00:34:00.369
Becky: you know, I've already provided this while you asking for this information again, does that sound right?

368
00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:01.969
Yeah, it's

369
00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:06.639
> P3: you know. Why are you asking me stuff you already know about me? Because I've provided it

370
00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:08.280
> P3: when I created this?

371
00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:13.720
> P3: So why do I have to reidentify myself in such a fashion?

372
00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:19.379
Every single time I log in and right back to the

373
00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:23.449
> P3: do not challenge this device. Remember me.

374
00:34:23.949 --> 00:34:25.560
You know that kind of thing

375
00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:27.970
Becky: that verification is done.

376
00:34:28.739 --> 00:34:30.380
> P3: I shouldn't have to do it anymore.

377
00:34:32.429 --> 00:34:43.420
Becky: Yeah, so I wanna walk back to something you said earlier. So you already know your health facility. We're gonna protect. Pretend that your health help. Facility is

378
00:34:43.429 --> 00:34:50.529
Becky: starts with the word James. so you can click inside the box, and we'll pretend, like you actually typed in the word James.

379
00:34:52.389 --> 00:35:00.139
Becky: And now your facility is James J. Peter. So how would you? What would you do next? Here?

380
00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:04.329
> P3: Once I found my name that'd be the one I would click

381
00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:11.410
Becky: right, and after selecting your health facility, what would you do here?

382
00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:16.930
Here, that would be it. So I would just click, continue.

383
00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:23.470
Becky: All right, let's go ahead and click. Continue. Then. after you've selected your health facility

384
00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:26.630
> P3: what I find also annoying.

385
00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:29.680
Becky: After I've selected my facility.

386
00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:34.190
> P3: it still brings up the others

387
00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:36.210
that are not me.

388
00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:44.019
Becky: Hmm! So it sounds like you'd expect just to see the one you selected. That's interesting

389
00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:47.040
when I can't go back, I guess.

390
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:53.640
> P3: But when I, selecting from the search the Va health facility, search by name

391
00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:58.950
> P3: already put in my name. I found me. I selected me.

392
00:35:59.410 --> 00:36:01.100
and that gave me my research

393
00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:07.910
> P3: or my facility. and then it says, Select Va. Health facility required. Well, it already did that.

394
00:36:09.290 --> 00:36:10.590
That's how we got here.

395
00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:14.240
> P3: So I got it because

396
00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:15.310
we did that

397
00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:18.140
there was nothing else to do

398
00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:25.880
Becky: right. I see how that could be. A bit repetitive is what you're saying there.

399
00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:28.709
> P3: and this my facility is not listed

400
00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:30.960
that should be tied in up here.

401
00:36:34.090 --> 00:36:39.199
> P3: okay? Or right below the box. because once I

402
00:36:39.370 --> 00:36:42.769
> P3: gone in and started typing in search by name.

403
00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:45.040
> P3: If I'm not finding me

404
00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:55.940
> P3: and I would do the search by location to say, Okay, this is where I'm at. What are my facilities here? And I'm assuming names would be associated with that, too. But

405
00:36:56.140 --> 00:37:05.850
> P3: still, if they don't see me. that's where I'd say my facility is not listed. not after selecting who I am and where I'm where my facility is.

406
00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:10.199
Becky: Got it. So it sounds like this flows a little

407
00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:15.700
> P3: out of order for you, and some things aren't where you would expect them to be right. It's

408
00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:22.349
> P3: and we joke around about it a lot. But it's like, I say, we're moving at the speed of government.

409
00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:33.719
> P3: And unfortunately, we're in the Federal Government side. So we're moving at the speed they think we should want to do. Not what is actually logical or

410
00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:35.280
> P3: user-friendly.

411
00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:39.289
Becky: Yeah, yeah, that's that's really helpful to understand?

412
00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:42.289
> P3: I've yeah, I've spoken with other

413
00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:50.420
> P3:  other veterans, especially older than I am, who do a lot of traveling to the different facilities. So they're constantly filling in there

414
00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:57.780
> P3: travel, reimbursement requests, and the folks at the windows are always saying, Well, you can fill this out online.

415
00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:08.020
> P3: And I go. Do you know how long it takes to fill out that form online. I've complained so many times about that website I've gone back to just I've got mine printed

416
00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:11.789
> P3: that's scanned in. I check a few boxes sign and date

417
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.710
> P3: that type of thing that I printed

418
00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:21.790
> P3: saying, this is where I've been. This is where I'm going. Blah! Blah! Blah! It's a very simple form.

419
00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:33.430
> P3: Why, that form could not be online where folks could click, click, click, electronic signature. The dates are automatically filled in for you, or you can change them if you need to

420
00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:38.190
> P3: and submit it electronically to Va travel.

421
00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:43.779
> P3: because that they used to have in the in the facilities.

422
00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:49.160
> P3: Those were fantastic. So by all means, let's get rid of them.

423
00:38:50.470 --> 00:39:02.010
Becky: Yeah, you know. Now, hearing that, and really curious to hear what you think of the rest of this form. So just moving us along, can you hit? Continue? And then we'll see. We'll see what's up next.

424
00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:12.309
Becky:  What are you? Or here's where we're asking for phone and email. And just for the sake of time, let's go ahead and click. Continue. This is

425
00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:14.379
Becky: a bit more straightforward.

426
00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:26.760
Becky: And then here, with your contact preference, could you go ahead? And I'm so sorry. That was right, Doc. Could you go ahead and select us mail as the way that you'd prefer to be contacted.

427
00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:27.660
> P3: Okay.

428
00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:30.030
Becky: alright and hit. Continue

429
00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:37.000
Becky: alright. And then in this scenario, what would you do? To answer this question here

430
00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:42.229
> P3:  oh, Jeeze.

431
00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:45.730
> P3: but I at this point.

432
00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:48.419
> P3: I would probably just

433
00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:50.969
> P3: close my browser.

434
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:58.300
> P3: we're still on 304, this is like the fifth time we clicked

435
00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:05.960
> P3: a country where you receive receive mail. if

436
00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.190
> P3: we already provided

437
00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:16.979
> P3: name, address, social security number, birthday, a list of several screens ago.

438
00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:22.120
> P3: So again, this is redundant and useless and frustrating

439
00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:27.540
> P3: also information that is in my profile

440
00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:29.139
> P3: when I created.

441
00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:38.990
Becky: Yeah, that that seems to be a common theme here. Could you go ahead and click the dropdown and select United States here?

442
00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:39.780
> P3: Okay.

443
00:40:39.930 --> 00:40:42.570
Becky: alright. And then we'll go ahead and click. Continue.

444
00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:43.560
> P3: Okay.

445
00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:50.660
Becky: and then same thing for this mail address. We'll go ahead and click continue since. We can't fill in anything right now

446
00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:58.460
Becky: and then on this screen for the sake of time, could you go ahead and click, continue here. This is where it verify your address.

447
00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:02.169
Becky: all right, and then landing on this page.

448
00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:08.829
Becky:  what is? What's your first impression of this page?

449
00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:10.989
Becky: What do you think it's trying to show you?

450
00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:17.259
> P3: Yes, they're giving me a chance to

451
00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:23.610
> P3: update something that didn't go right on the website. Or

452
00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:27.450
because

453
00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:29.390
again.

454
00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:35.200
> P3: just like I, said, just about everything that we've gone through

455
00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:37.239
should have been tied to the profile.

456
00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:41.349
Becky:  so I guess they're trying to

457
00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:42.670
suggest.

458
00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:46.459
> P3: do I have anything in my profile that needs updating

459
00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:47.720
are changing.

460
00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:54.339
> P3: but they're still, gonna ask for it. Regardless. So it's like, why do I even have a profile?

461
00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:02.609
Becky: Got it? Yeah, this seems to be a common I'm seeing a common theme in your your feedback here.

462
00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:05.230
> P3: Yeah, all of this has been redundant.

463
00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:09.340
> P3: It's already available at some point

464
00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:15.320
> P3: just the last few pages here where it was asking for address and stuff like that again.

465
00:42:15.930 --> 00:42:18.299
> P3: That was provided several screens ago.

466
00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:27.129
> P3: And again. all that information is in the profile. When you create your account and register

467
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:34.819
Becky: got it so on on this page, would you? What would you do here? Can you show me?

468
00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:41.139
> P3:  Why, I would need to?

469
00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:56.249
Becky: Yeah. So I saw you expanded these so you could see all the information.

470
00:42:56.600 --> 00:43:00.830
> P3: that's what I would wind up doing is like. what am I reviewing?

471
00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:02.310
Becky: Hmm!

472
00:43:03.570 --> 00:43:05.249
> P3: Go through all of that

473
00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:10.170
> P3: to say, well, I guess I need to

474
00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:15.500
see what's going on. Because. hmm.

475
00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:32.929
Becky: yeah, let let's say in this scenario to your reviewing everything. And you actually notice that? You input your phone number incorrectly. Can you tell me where we you would go to correct your phone number?

476
00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:48.919
> P3: Interesting? It's not in need

477
00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:51.390
personal information. There's the contact.

478
00:43:53.430 --> 00:44:00.420
 me, this whole section contact information. I would click edit at this point.

479
00:44:00.610 --> 00:44:07.590
> P3: The Contact Information section here and the mailing address section here.

480
00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:14.320
Becky: Got it? Let's go ahead and click the edit button and contact information.

481
00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:16.830
All of that

482
00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:20.550
> P3: really should fall under the personal information. My opinion.

483
00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:29.220
Becky: Got it so why do you think it should fall under personal information? And what are you seeing here?

484
00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:30.859
Well,

485
00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:32.910
> P3: Identification.

486
00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:34.790
That's just

487
00:44:36.370 --> 00:44:38.570
so. I guess that would be the first part.

488
00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:40.570
Okay.

489
00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:46.049
> P3: again, even relationship information.

490
00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:48.439
It could be under the personal area

491
00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:51.410
but

492
00:44:53.950 --> 00:44:56.370
Becky: got it.

493
00:44:56.570 --> 00:44:58.470
> P3: We've already put in our name

494
00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:04.279
> P3: preferred names. So nicknames and all that social security number, date of birth.

495
00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:07.260
 no.

496
00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:14.479
> P3: no reason not to have the address in there, since they're asking for that as personal information at the beginning.

497
00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:17.370
> P3: Same thing with the phone number and email

498
00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:23.189
Becky: got it.

499
00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:25.900
> P3: Mailing addresses down here when

500
00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:30.490
that's all personal information. That's that's one block.

501
00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:39.920
Becky: Hmm, right? So you're seeing it sounds like you're seeing this as separate sections that aren't under personal information.

502
00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:52.220
Becky: Yeah, go. So go ahead and click cancel under next to update, and we'll go over to the next the next screen.

503
00:45:52.450 --> 00:45:55.369
Becky: So go ahead and click. Submit. Question here.

504
00:45:57.010 --> 00:46:05.449
Becky: alright, and I'll give you a minute to read this, and then afterwards let me know when you're done, and then can you summarize the page back to me, and and what it's saying to you.

505
00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:26.650
> P3: okay, it's just basically a confirmation saying, Hey, we've got your question.

506
00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:31.579
> P3: Here's your reference number. If you need to contact us about your contact.

507
00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:39.119
> P3: You'll also receive an email confirmation that should reply within 7 business days through the Us. Mail.

508
00:46:42.450 --> 00:46:46.739
Becky: What would you expect to happen next? After reading all this?

509
00:46:47.970 --> 00:46:48.910
Hmm.

510
00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:56.700
> P3: At some point someone may or may not do something within the time frame, they said.

511
00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:03.090
Becky: got it, and what makes you say may or may not do something within the timeframe

512
00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:04.570
just based on

513
00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:07.250
> P3: personal experience. Hmm!

514
00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:10.710
Previous attempts at

515
00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:12.629
> P3: communicating this way.

516
00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:14.520
Umhm.

517
00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:19.729
> P3: like, I say, we've we went through all of that other nonsense

518
00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:24.220
> P3: to get to the page that says, Okay, we got it. Here's your reference number.

519
00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:27.700
We'll be contacting you if we need more information

520
00:47:29.370 --> 00:47:37.590
Becky: sounds like I didn't get to ask this on the previous thing. So it sounds like this was a a long form to you.

521
00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:38.450
Yes.

522
00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:41.130
> P3: this was extremely low.

523
00:47:42.170 --> 00:47:43.110
Becky: Audit

524
00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:51.129
Becky:  alright! And and at this page, too, is there anything else you'd like to know? After submitting your question?

525
00:47:52.770 --> 00:48:00.859
> P3:  Well, they've given me a reference number.

526
00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:03.240
> P3: But they don't say how to use it.

527
00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:07.279
> P3:  if I have another question.

528
00:48:08.910 --> 00:48:11.120
or, if I it's been

529
00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:13.679
> P3: 12 days and I've heard nothing.

530
00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:20.729
> P3: Who do I contact? How do I contact them? So I can give this number to them.

531
00:48:21.850 --> 00:48:24.850
> P3: and other than going through the call center.

532
00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:34.970
> P3: That's the 1,607 1,000. Everybody knows that phone number someone other than the people we want to talk to.

533
00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:43.190
> P3: That gets us to the people that will send the note to the people we want to talk to saying, Hey, this person wants to talk to you.

534
00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:46.060
> P3: which may or may not

535
00:48:47.130 --> 00:48:48.220
happened right away.

536
00:48:50.810 --> 00:48:55.199
Becky: Got it that that makes sense to me.

537
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:59.230
> P3: They actually got the message that we wanted them to get

538
00:49:01.070 --> 00:49:09.689
when I contact that number. I have the person read back the the exact message I want to hear. or that I want delayed.

539
00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:15.539
> P3: and sometimes I say, Well, I'm still writing it like. Well, then, why are you asking me if that's all?

540
00:49:17.250 --> 00:49:18.080
So

541
00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:20.650
it's

542
00:49:21.310 --> 00:49:23.199
> P3: just one of those deals where it's like.

543
00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:25.569
> P3: this is nice information. But

544
00:49:25.650 --> 00:49:26.890
okay, now, what

545
00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:40.549
Becky: got it? Yeah, that's that's really helpful. Just your last quote. There, this is nice information. But now what? So it seems like they're still they're still wondering what will happen, even though you get this information.

546
00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:41.520
> P3: I mean, if

547
00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:42.330
yes.

548
00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:50.560
> P3: additional contact information is needed where I need to provide that reference number hopefully, that's going to show up in the email confirmation.

549
00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:53.089
> P3: But sure be nice to say

550
00:49:53.130 --> 00:50:00.979
> P3: you will receive an email confirmation with further instructions on how to contact. Someone related to this or preference number

551
00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:02.599
or something to that effect.

552
00:50:04.050 --> 00:50:10.509
Becky: got it so a little more detail would be helpful on that aspect.

553
00:50:11.770 --> 00:50:23.769
> P3: Supposedly the electronic communications. They get the bare minimum of what's necessary or what they think is necessary. But they don't. They don't step into my shoes.

554
00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:40.130
> P3: I mean, I'm I'm at the point now. I need to try and find the letter of who I've been switched to within one month's timeframe. I was switched from one provider to another, and I think they're on different teams. Now.

555
00:50:40.890 --> 00:50:44.869
> P3: I've got medications that have expired, so I don't know who I need to call.

556
00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:49.810
> P3: because I haven't seen the new one, and I only saw the previous one

557
00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:54.250
primary care provider once. So

558
00:50:55.690 --> 00:50:56.510
it's

559
00:50:57.310 --> 00:51:01.260
> P3: there are. I hate using the Y mean.

560
00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:02.310
but

561
00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:06.200
> P3: I'm the one that falls through the cracks. I'm the one that gets

562
00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:10.559
misplaced, misdirected. not listen to.

563
00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:17.840
> P3: I mean, it's bad enough, just seeing a primary care provider. But when I go to the emergency room.

564
00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:22.229
> P3: when I, having an allergic reaction to a new medication that's

565
00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:23.950
causing severe

566
00:51:25.350 --> 00:51:29.870
symptoms. and I get forgotten in the emergency room waiting room.

567
00:51:31.690 --> 00:51:40.760
Becky: Yeah, no, that sounds like a very frustrating situation. I'm sorry you had to go through that.

568
00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:43.090
Lb, really thinks of me.

569
00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:45.459
Becky: Not just veterans accounts for me

570
00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:48.580
because I don't hear that happening to other folks

571
00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:53.849
Becky: have a long wait or something, because other people come in after them.

572
00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:57.269
> P3: I mean. I showed up at the the emergency room

573
00:51:57.630 --> 00:52:02.030
> P3: the ambulance brought in another tunnel of elder veteran with

574
00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:13.589
> P3: cardiac condition. So yeah, by all means. I understand him going before me.  to be flat out told, oh, I'm, sorry we forgot, you were here.

575
00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:20.050
> P3: I've been staring at you at the desk. You could see me eye to eye every time you looked up.

576
00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:25.380
> P3: I believe that you forgot I was here because you saw me here.

577
00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:27.070
So

578
00:52:27.670 --> 00:52:30.959
> P3: yeah, that's happened more than once. I mean the emergency room

579
00:52:31.770 --> 00:52:36.490
> P3: after hours, pharmacy and all kinds of stuff where I'm needing medications and whatnot. But

580
00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:44.869
Becky: right, yeah, that's why we're we're speaking with you today to understand your experiences. Not just

581
00:52:44.990 --> 00:53:01.879
Becky: well, especially in interacting with some of these online experiences, too. So we can try to alleviate some of those frustration. So you know, going back to something you've mentioned throughout this is that the information's in your profile already.

582
00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:03.580
Becky: So

583
00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:15.409
Becky: you mentioned again, there's a lot of information that's in your profile. So what if you didn't sign in at the start of this form? What would you expect then, in this experience.

584
00:53:15.630 --> 00:53:19.829
> P3: if I didn't sign in? Everything we went through was what I would expect

585
00:53:22.770 --> 00:53:25.900
> P3: because, how are they gonna know who I am

586
00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:28.449
and am. I really mean type of thing.

587
00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:32.100
> P3: That's where all that other information should come from.

588
00:53:33.110 --> 00:53:35.140
> P3: Once my profile is set.

589
00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:40.039
> P3: I registered in the system. They verified my registration

590
00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:42.100
> P3: through whatever means they need to.

591
00:53:42.430 --> 00:53:47.730
> P3:  I see no need for that additional stuff.

592
00:53:47.970 --> 00:53:51.079
> P3: Yeah. They'll want to know why I'm contacting and things like that. But

593
00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:57.970
> P3:  You already know it's me there's

594
00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:00.499
got a profile registered in the system.

595
00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:03.929
> P3: Why am I giving you all my profile information.

596
00:54:06.310 --> 00:54:20.579
Becky: Got it? Yeah, thanks for helping us understand? Like that. Your expectations between signing in and having all your profile information versus not signing in and then having to provide all that information that's helpful.

597
00:54:21.870 --> 00:54:23.110
I'm glad it can help.

598
00:54:25.250 --> 00:54:49.899
Becky: Yeah. So we we are a minute from the end of the session and you know I so appreciate you sharing your time and this feedback and all of your experiences with me. It's been ho! So helpful to learn, and just to walk through this prototype with you. I do. Wanna leave some time here at the end to ask if you have any questions for me or anything. You wanted to leave for us.

599
00:54:50.250 --> 00:54:51.440
> P3: No, that's

600
00:54:51.530 --> 00:55:00.510
> P3: pretty much it like, I say, the the main thing is the the redundancy of information requested for verification when it's already there.

601
00:55:00.860 --> 00:55:04.059
> P3: and not being able to

602
00:55:05.530 --> 00:55:07.710
> P3: do not challenge this device.

603
00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:09.050
> P3: remember me

604
00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:18.159
anything like that where I don't have to keep doing the challenge questions and get the verification code and then enter a Captcha information.

605
00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:20.310
It's

606
00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:28.359
> P3: this is me. We've done this already, I said. Well, like, I say, especially multiple times during the day

607
00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:30.910
that bugs the heck out of me.

608
00:55:32.250 --> 00:55:37.250
Becky: Got it? Yeah, I think that's what I'm taking out of this session, too, that you're

609
00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:48.770
Becky: and experience user. And you know, you've already provided this information. So that's where your perspective is coming from, too registered in the system that has a profile.

610
00:55:49.570 --> 00:55:51.369
> P3: that information is available.

611
00:55:53.310 --> 00:55:54.150
I mean.

612
00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:56.700
> P3: yeah, I could see, maybe.

613
00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:01.759
> P3: you know, sending a verification code to say, this is my profile, but

614
00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:04.689
> P3: that should be done once.

615
00:56:05.570 --> 00:56:11.050
and then profile verified. All this information is verified. This is me.

616
00:56:12.330 --> 00:56:16.279
> P3: Quit asking me, you know, quit challenging me to be me, but I know it's me.

617
00:56:16.350 --> 00:56:18.790
> P3: and you know it's me. And I know you know, it's me

618
00:56:19.090 --> 00:56:19.860
type of thing.

619
00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:29.829
Becky: right? Yeah, definitely, if frustrating to continue to be asked for for the same information over and over again. So

620
00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:32.569
Becky: I definitely hear that. And

621
00:56:32.690 --> 00:56:55.359
Becky: again. I just appreciate that we've gone through all this, and you've provided your feedback, whether that's negative or positive, it's all helpful for us to understand veterans, perspectives, and so perigee, and who help schedule the session. They'll send you a thank you. Note, with some information you can pass along to other veterans if they so like to participate in future sessions.

622
00:56:55.400 --> 00:57:05.249
Becky: And with that I will end the session, and I hope you have a lovely rest of your day. Thank you again for sharing all of your experiences with us.

623
00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:07.440
> P3: Thank you, Becky. Thanks everyone else.

624
00:57:07.990 --> 00:57:11.760
Becky: Alright, thanks, [P3]. Bye-bye, bye.
