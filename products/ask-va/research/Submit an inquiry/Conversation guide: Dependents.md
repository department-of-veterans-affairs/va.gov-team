## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is `TYLER OR BECKY`, I’m a researcher from the VA.

I work on improving VA.gov so it's easier for Veterans to contact the VA online if they have a question.

What I hope to do today is get a sense of how we can make this process better.

What I don't want to do is add to any frustration that may have led you to contact the VA - or even frustration you've had with actually contacting the VA - in the past. I want to be up front and say that I don't have a way of fixing those past experiences. But, I do want to know about your frustrations in case they're things we can improve in the future.

Now before we get started, there are a few other things I want to mention:

* **This session should take about an hour.** I will make sure we don’t spend longer than that, and so I may occasionally move us along to the next question or topic so we can cover everything.
* **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We’re not testing your ability. And I want you to know that I’m not going to be offended by any opinions you express, I'm here to get your feedback.
* **I’m going to share a prototype with you today.** This is like a pretend version of the website, and so it may not function exactly the way you expect. For example, you’ll be able to click some buttons or links, but not all of them. And there’s certain things you’ll read that might not match what you see on the VA’s real website today.
* **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, you just have to let me know.** And that might be a pause to get some water or to stop the session completely. You'll be paid even if we don't complete the full session.
* When they set up this session, Perigean asked if you are okay with a couple of observers joining us. **I want to confirm with you now, are you okay with a couple of observers joining this session?**
    * `IF NO` Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
    * `IF YES` Great, they're in the waiting room so I'm going to let them into the meeting now.

> Admit observers and let them introduce themselves before turning off their cameras.

* Next I’d like to ask you about recordings. We use recordings to confirm that we’ve captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we finish the study, and none of your comments are attributed to you directly. **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
    * `IF NO` Don't record
    * `IF YES` Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

> Start recording: `RECORD TO CLOUD`.

> Click `LIVE TRANSCRIPT` and `ENABLE` or `SHOW CAPTIONS`.

* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?**

## Agenda - 60 minutes

* Warm up - 5 minutes
* Submit an inquiry - 35 minutes
* Ongoing or past inquiry - 15 minutes
* Wrap up - 3 minutes
* Thank you - 2 minutes

## Warm up - 5 minutes

I'd like to start by learning more about your experience with the VA and our online services.

* I understand you’re the dependent of a Veteran, is that correct?
  * How long have you been a dependent?
  * Does the Veteran who you are a dependent of, also have other dependents?
* And can you confirm whether you’re currently enrolled in VA health care?
* How often do you go online to use VA services, such as, schedule a medical appointment or check your benefits?
  * Have you ever contacted the VA online or over the phone?
    * `IF NO` Why might you contact the VA?
    * `IF YES`
        * Can you tell me about a time when you contacted the VA?
        * Do you usually contact the VA `OVER THE PHONE OR ONLINE`? Why?
        * `IF ONLINE` Did you use your phone, tablet or computer?
        * How did you find the support you received `OVER THE PHONE OR ONLINE`?

#### Things to watch for:

* Did they confirm they’re a dependent?
* Are they a dependent of a Veteran who has multiple dependents?
* How do they decide which channel to use when they contact the VA?
* Do they specify the device they use (tablet, mobile, desktop)?

## Submit an inquiry - 35 minutes

Thanks, it’s helpful to learn about some of your experience with the VA.

Next, I’d like to share some ideas with you so we can get your feedback. In the Zoom chat, I'm going to send you a link to a prototype. I mentioned earlier a prototype is like a pretend version of a website.

> Send Sketch link in Zoom chat.

* Can you open this link?
* Have you shared your screen on Zoom before?
    * `IF YES` Great. Can you please share your screen?
    * `IF NO` I’ll walk you through how to do that...

Thanks! Now I’m able to see the prototype too.

### 1: Start page

> Screen: Start page

Now that we have this open, I'd like us to start by imagining that you need to ask the VA a question about `YOUR or ANOTHER DEPENDENT'S` health care.

* First off, can you tell me what this page is about?

I’ll give you a second to read this page more closely now.

* Before we click anything, what would you do first if you wanted to `ASK A QUESTION`?
    * How long would you expect it to take to `ASK A QUESTION`?

`A: SIGN IN/CREATE AN ACCOUNT`

* Why would you click sign in/create an account?
    * Does it seem like you need to sign in, in order to start?
    * Would you sign in with your account, the Veteran’s account, or another dependent’s account?
    * What if you had a question about life insurance instead of health care, would you need to sign in?
    * Remember, today we’re imagining that you have a question about health care. Do you need to sign in?
    * Are there any benefits of signing in?

`B: CONTINUE WITHOUT SIGNING IN`

* What do you expect to happen after you click continue?

Okay, let’s go ahead and click `OPTION THEY CHOOSE` now.

#### Things to watch for:

* Where would they (likely) click first?
* Do they notice that they need to sign in order to ask a question about this topic?
* Would they sign in with their own account, or use the Veteran’s or another dependent’s account?
* Is it clear when they need to sign in or when it is optional?
* Which authentication link do they click?

### 2a: Sign in

> Screen: Sign in

So, for today, we’ll just pretend that we’re signing in.

* Which option do you usually choose to sign in?

Let’s click `OPTION THEY CHOOSE` and we’ll continue.

#### Things to watch for:

* Are they familiar with the sign in screen?
* Do they remember which sign in credential they use?

### 2b, 3a: About you

> Screen: About you

Okay, now we’re on this page.

* First, can you tell me what we’re looking at here?
* If you had to guess, how long do you think this process is going to take?

> Field: Who are you asking a question for?

I mentioned earlier that we’re going to imagine that you have a question about `YOUR or ANOTHER DEPENDENT'S` health care. Knowing this…

* How would you answer this question?
   * Would you have trouble answering this question?
   * Why do you think the VA is asking this?
* Before we click continue, what do you expect to see on the next page?

`IF THEY WERE SENT BACK VIA MODAL TO SIGN IN`

* Does this page look familiar?
* Do you notice anything different? `KEEP IN MIND: THEIR INFO HAS BEEN SAVED/PRE-FILLED`.

#### Things to watch for:

* Is it straightforward to answer this question?

### 3b, 4a: Category and topic

> Screen: Category and topic

So we're imagining you have a question about `YOUR or ANOTHER DEPENDENT'S` health care. Let’s think of a question you might have.

* Does a question come to mind?
   * `NEED EXAMPLE: ENROLLED IN VA HEALTH CARE` That’s okay. Let’s say `YOU or ANOTHER DEPENDENT` wanted to get a hearing test.
   * `NEED EXAMPLE: NOT ENROLLED` That’s okay. Let’s say you wanted to know if `YOU or ANOTHER DEPENDENT` are/is eligible for VA health care.

Great. Now keeping that question in mind…

* Can you show me how you would answer the first two questions on this page? It’s helpful if you tell me outloud why you’re choosing each option.

> Field: Which category best describes your question?

> Field: Which topic best describes your question?

* Did you have any trouble answering these questions?
* How important do you think it is to answer these questions correctly?
* What do you think happens based on what you choose here?
* What if you couldn't find an option that fit your inquiry, what would you do?

Let’s finish answering the questions on this page. Since this is a prototype, it only includes some options. You might not be able to select `YOUR or ANOTHER DEPENDENT'S` state or medical center, so if that’s the case you can just choose any state or medical center from the list.

> Field: State where VA Medical Center is located

> Field: VA Medical Center

* Before we click continue, what do you expect to see on the next page?

#### Things to watch for:

* If they thought of their own question, is it related to health care?
* Is it straightforward to find a category?
* Is it straightforward to find a topic?
* Do they think it's important to choose the right category and topic?
* Do they recognize that the category and topic they choose will send their inquiry to the right person?

### 4b: Sign in modal

> Screen: Sign in modal

`IF THEY DIDN'T ALREADY AUTHENTICATE: MODAL APPEARS`

Okay, it looks like something has appeared.

* What is this asking you to do?
* Why does it need you to sign in or create an account?
* Would you sign in with your account, the Veteran’s account, or another dependent’s account?
* How do you feel, reading this?
* What do you expect to happen next?

`THEY ARE SENT BACK TO SIGN IN`

#### Things to watch for:

* Are they confused about why they are being asked to sign in?
* Do they feel like they're going to have to start over now?
* Do they show likelihood of giving up at any point?

### 5: Question

> Screen: Your question

> Field: What is your question?

* How would you answer this question?
   * Would you have any trouble with this?
* Would you upload a document along with your question? Why or why not?
   * If you did upload a document, what type of document are you allowed to upload?
* Before we click continue, what do you expect to see on the next page?

#### Things to watch for:

* Are they hesitant about writing their question free-text?
* Do they seem surprised or frustrated that it’s taken until Step 3 to input their question?
* Does uploading a document seem familiar?

### 6: Veteran’s information

> Screen: Veteran’s information

* Before we look closely at this page, how much longer do you think you have left, to finish submitting your question?
* And who’s information are you going to input on this page?

Thanks. Next, I’d like you to scroll through this list of questions slowly. You don’t need to tell me the information you would type in, for example, you don’t need to tell me the Veteran’s first name is “Alex.”

Instead I’d like you to tell me when something sticks out at you. This might be something unexpected or a question you don’t think you would be able to answer.

> Field: Veteran’s first name

> Field: Veteran’s middle name

> Field: Veteran’s last name

> Field: Veteran’s suffix

> Field: Veteran’s preferred name

* Is there anything on this page you wouldn’t be able to answer?
* Why do you think the VA is collecting this information about the Veteran?
* Before we click continue, what do you expect to see on the next page?

#### Things to watch for:

* Do they realize this is asking for the Veteran’s information, not theirs?
* Would they choose to answer questions that are not required?
* Does the number of questions on this page seem overwhelming?
* Do they show likelihood of giving up at any point?

### 7a: Dependent’s information (other dependent)

> Screen: Dependent’s information

* Is this what you expected to see next?
* And who’s information are you going to input on this page?

We’re going to do the same thing, you can scroll down slowly and tell me if there’s anything you notice.

* Why do you think the VA is collecting this information about the dependent?

* Would they choose to answer questions that are not required?
* Does the number of questions on this page seem overwhelming?

* Would they choose to answer questions that are not required?
* Does the number of questions on this page seem overwhelming?
* Do they show likelihood of giving up at any point?

### 8: Summary

> Screen: Review and send

* Can you tell me what we’re looking at?
   * Why do you think the VA is showing you a `SUMMARY`?
* If you read this summary, and noticed that you had a typo in your question, what would you do?
* What if you noticed that you chose the wrong topic and you wanted to change it to a different topic. What would you do?
* What do you expect to happen after you send your question?

#### Things to watch for:

* What is this page telling you?
* Is there anything else that you’d like to know after you submit an inquiry?

Great, thank you. I’m going to ask you to stop sharing your screen now. For the rest of our conversation, we’ll just talk face-to-face.

> Stop screen share.

#### Things to watch for:

* Do they notice anything helpful or missing from this page?
* Do they mention saving their reference number?
* Do they mention preferring text notifications over email?

## Ongoing or past inquiry - 15 minutes

* Thinking back on the process of submitting a question, was it shorter or longer than you would have expected?
   * Is there anything that could have made it easier?
* And after you submit an inquiry, what do you expect to happen?
   * Do you expect to get updates?
   * How would you expect to get an update? `TEXT, EMAIL, RECEIVE A NOTIFICATION IN YOUR PROFILE, ETC.`
   * How often?
   * Do you expect the VA to notify the Veteran `OR OTHER DEPENDENT` as well as yourself?
   * How would you look up your inquiry?
* How would you expect to get a response to your inquiry?
   * Who would respond?
   * Would you be able to reply?
   * If you couldn’t reply back, but you had a follow up question, what would you do?
* Let’s say you wanted to go back and look at a question you had submitted a few months ago. What would you be interested in seeing?
   * For example, would you want to see all the information you submitted? Or would you just like to see certain things?
   * Anything else?

#### Things to watch for:

* Do they recall being given a reference number?
* Do they recall stating how they prefer to be contacted, when they filled out the form?
* How do they expect updates and how often?
* Do they mention preferring text notifications over email?
* Do they expect the Veteran (or other dependent) to get notified as well?
* Do they seem likely to go back and review a past inquiry (once it's resolved)?

## Wrap up - 3 minutes

We covered a lot today. Before we finish, I want to give us a couple minutes to reflect.

* How or where would you expect to find this tool that you just used?
* What worked well for you?
* What was unclear or didn't work well for you?
* Is there anything else you want to share with me?

Great, thank you! Those are all of the questions I have for you today.

* Do you have any questions for me?

## Thank you - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Pause or exit strategies

#### If the participant isn't feeling well.

I'm sorry you're `NOT FEELING WELL`. Do you feel up for continuing? You'll be paid even if we stop early.

(If they choose to continue) Okay, just let me know if you change your mind.

#### If the participant is showing signs of upset or distress.

This sounds so hard. Would you like to take a break or stop?

`If they choose to take a break and come back` Welcome back. I'm interested to hear more about... are you up for continuing or would you prefer we move to the next topic?

#### If the participant decides to stop.

Thank you for time on this call, I completely understand your decision to stop.

`If they seem distressed` Before you go, the VA Hotline number is 988, it's a confidential helpline, and it's 24/7. It's up to you whether you call.

#### If the participant is fine to continue, but you aren't.

I hear that you're okay to continue. Before we do, I realized that I need a minute. I'm going to turn off my camera and microphone, and get a glass of water. Is that okay with you? I'll be back in 3 minutes.

`If you're still not able to continue` Thanks for letting me take a break. You didn't do anything wrong, but I'm realizing that I'm not going to be able to continue this session. You will still be paid for the full time. I really appreciate you sharing with me today. Is it okay with you if we stop? Thanks very much.
