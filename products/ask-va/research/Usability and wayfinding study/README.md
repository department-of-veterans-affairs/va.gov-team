# About this research

## Study
This research has not started yet. There is no associated issue in the [Research Repository](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/880).

## Background
Ask VA (AVA) is an online portal that allows Veterans, caregivers, and supporting personnel in education, debt, loans, etc. to submit questions to VA and receive a secure message response. Currently, Ask VA (AVA) resides within a stand-alone Microsoft portal that is inconsistent with the VA design standards, is not mobile-friendly, and has accessibility issues.

Through moderated usability testing with users we should use a coded, working prototype(s) to review whether they can find Ask VA around VA.gov, authenticate if necessary or desired, and successfully submit and review inquiries.

## Research Goals
* Review whether users can successfully submit and review an inquiry
* Review where Ask VA should live and be linked to from
* Review how users experience authentication

## Recruitment
We will recruit through Perigean.

## Date
This research is likely to start in October-November 2023.
