## When business lines say they need or don't need military service information

This is when business lines ([review list of stakeholders](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/research/Business%20line%20engagement/List%20of%20stakeholders%20by%20category.md)) have stated they need or don't need particular military service information in Ask VA.

This list is alphabetized by category name. There is also a screenshot of the spreadsheet we used to collect this information in the [appendix](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/research/Business%20line%20engagement/List%20of%20military%20service%20fields.md#appendix).

## How we should use their feedback to inform our designs

- Include these fields as required for all categories, because all business lines agree:
  - `First name`
  - `Last name`
  - `Date of Birth`
  - `SSN`
- Remove these fields from the form, because all business lines agree:
  - `Service start date`
  - `Service end date`
- We confirmed again that VBA-ART and `Veteran ID Card (VIC)` need `Branch of Service` as part of their ID protocol requirements, so we need to require `Branch of Service` for at least these categories:
  - `Veteran ID Card (VIC)`
  - `Disability compensation`
  - `Survivor benefits`
  - `Burials and memorials`
  - `Center for Women Veterans`
  - `Benefits issues outside the U.S.`
- `DoD/EDIPI number` is needed by around 50% of business lines, so we need to require `DoD/EDIPI number' for at least these categories:
  - `Center for Minority Veterans`
  - `Decisions reviews and appeals`
  - `Life insurance`
  - `Burials and memorials`
  - `Health care` (depends on the topic)
  - `Veteran ID Card (VIC)`
  - `Veteran Readiness and Employment`
  - `Sign in and technical issues`
  - `DEERS (Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System)`
- We are still confirming whether:
  - `Housing assistance and home loans` needs `Service number`, if all other business lines do not?
  - `Decision reviews and appeals` needs `Claim number`, if all other business lines do not?

**This document is still being updated, as we confirm the above.**
