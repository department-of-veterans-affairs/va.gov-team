# List of military service fields

Last updated by @tygindraux: October 13, 2023

This list has been sourced from all business lines ([review list of stakeholders](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/research/Business%20line%20engagement/List%20of%20stakeholders%20by%20category.md)). This is based on their needs, however, we still need to discuss how we design and build these fields. As examples, we could decide to keep them consistent across all categories but only make certain fields required, or, we could decide to remove/add fields depending on a business line's needs.
