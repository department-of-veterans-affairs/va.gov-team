# September 29, 2023: Burials and memorials business line review
*Ask VA Integration Team*

## Agenda

- Intro: 5 minutes
- Discuss topics: 35 minutes
- Closing: 5 minutes

## Attendees

- Our team: Tyler, Becky, Ruchi
- Sitewide Content: Laura, Derek
- NCA: Jennifer Kelly, Eric Powell
- Not present: Breon Johnson (VBA)

## Key takeaways

- We agreed on the topic name, `Pre-need eligibility for burial`.
- Eric and Jennifer suggested that we add a new topic, `Burial allowance for unclaimed Veteran remains`. We'll follow up with VBA to confirm.
- We agreed on adding two subtopics under `Memorial items`. These will each route to NCA or VBA, respectively.
> "NCA doesnâ€™t process burial flags. Those go to VBA."
- We discussed the name `Burial in a VA grant-funded cemetery` and how it could be interpreted. NCA was concerned that submitters don't know the difference between the different cemetery types. We agreed on Agreed on `Burial in a VA grant-funded state or tribal cemetery`.
> "It needs to have grant-funded in there, not every single one is grant funded."
- NCA pointed out that they get a lot of questions about Arlington National Cemetery (Department of Army). We do everything but the Arlington cemetery. We all agreed that a future improvement for Ask VA should be considering how to let people know what's not included in a category or topic.
