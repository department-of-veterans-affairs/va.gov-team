# August 16, 2023: Debt business line review
*Ask VA Integration Team*

## Agenda

- Introductions
- Review AVA form fields
- Review category and topic names

## Attendees

- Our team: Tyler, Becky, Ruchi
- Debt team: Tamara Dorle, Jason Hoge, Robert Vitt, Julie Lawrence
- CRM team: Chris, Wayne, Shelby
- Not present: Nicole Haselberger
  
## Key takeaways

- The Debt team has observed that most inquiries come in as “Question.” 
- They’ve also observed that most submitters’ contact preference is “Email.”
- We’ll update proposed names based on helpful context from the Debt team. 

> "I thought the reason why we put "a school official" because it's not always a SCO that's reaching out to DMC about debt."

> "Most of the types of debt that are going to be showing up are for meeting VR&E employment goals. I think this would cause confusion."

- They’ve phrased topics in a certain way to control the order the topics appear in, which we’ve similarly observed from other business lines
> "When we generalized, we put "A" in front of it because we wanted it to be the first one. "
