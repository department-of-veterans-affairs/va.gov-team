## Key takeaways

- We discussed the category and topic names at length, and the Center for Women Veterans (CWV)'s purpose as a policy office.
  - Similar to the `Center for Minority Veterans`, the CWV agreed to try out a shorter topic list:
     - Category name: `Center for Women Veterans`
       - Topic name: `Programs and policies`
       - Topic name: `General question`
  - We think this approach will ensure that Veterans can still come to the CWV when they prefer, but they aren't confused between choosing the CWV or another category due to the same topic name. This will also ensure we don't send the wrong message to Veterans, that only women need support with issues because they're only included in the CWV category, for example, `LGBTQ`. 
- CWV does not currently generate reports related to `Gender` data, and only glances at this field/response when they answer an inquiry. However, we think it is a congressional mandate to ask for this information. Our team will review the congressional mandate, but for now, our decision is to always ask for gender but never require an answer.
- CWV confirmed we will not ask submitter's for their contact preference, instead we will let them know they should expect a reply via email. This means the CWV will reply, by default, through Ask VA (Dynamics), not their personal email. We will still always collect submitter's phone number too. But mailing address will not be collected.
- CWV confirmed that military service information fields should match what VBA needs, in case they re-route an inquiry to them.
