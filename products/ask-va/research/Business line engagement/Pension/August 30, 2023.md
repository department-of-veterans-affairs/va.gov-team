# August 30, 2023: Pension business line review
*Ask VA Integration Team*

## Agenda

- Introductions
- Review AVA form fields
- Review category and topic names

## Attendees
 
- Our team: Tyler, Becky, Ruchi, Chante
- CRM team: Shelby, Wayne, Maria, Jaime
- Pension/Fiduciary: Angelita Taylor, Nancy Williams
- NCC: Scott Hadley
- VBA-Outreach, Transition & Economic Development (OTED): Robert Eakman
- VBA-ART: Breon Johnson (Partial)
- Not present: Jennifer Fuhrer (Pension/Fiduciary)

## Key takeaways

- Breon noted that VBA ART does not refer to the submitter's response to `tell us the reason you're contacting us`:
> "VBA ART does not use that. We focus on the content of the question."

- Both NCC and Pension & Fiduciary teams said they'll use which contact method a submitter prefers:
> "We do respond in the manner they request unless there's any issue with the contact method. If they ask for mail, we will do that. Same for phone, email.""

- The Fiduciary team doesn't think they use `gender` to answer inquiries, but asked that we follow up to confirm with Breon.
  
- The military service information fields are used for authentication purposes, Breon said:
> "We need their name, branch of service and SSN. Service number is kind of outdated. We don't really use that or the EDIPI number. But that might change."

- We asked whether `Aid and Attendance Benefits` should include `Housebound benefits` and learned:
> "On the application, it does say Aid and Attendance and housebound. If you put it together it'll be fine, but nothing wrong with just Aid and Attendance Benefits."

- We learned that `Fiduciary program` does not always include guardianship or custodianship (it's more complex than that). So we're considering using the label, `Fiduciary program (Guardianship or Custodianship)` across Ask VA. This is a category name, but also a topic name a few times within Ask VA.

## Actions

- [ ] Compile outstanding questions for Breon about category and topic names
