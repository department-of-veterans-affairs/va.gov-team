# Recommendation for removing `Gender` collection from Ask VA

Last updated by @beckyphung: October 30, 2023

We recommend not collecting `Gender` when we migrate Ask VA to VA.gov.

## VA.gov Design System
The [VA.gov Design System](https://design.va.gov/patterns/ask-users-for/gender) provides clear guidance to only ask for gender identity if it benefits the user experience: 
> **"Donâ€™t ask if it does not benefit the user experience.** You should only ask users about gender when absolutely necessary."

> "**We don't use [gender] at all.** Especially if someone has pronouns. Most of our responses are auto-generated. We don't pull reports about this or anything like that. We don't use it." - Ask VA agent from VBA

## Mandate by law?
The Center for Women Veterans (CWV) did share a [Federal law](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/PLAW-116publ315) with their understanding of why we must collect `Gender` information from submitters. However, after reviewing the law, we find that it only mandates collection of gender information when gender information is available in the dataset:
> "...disaggregate such data by gender, race, and ethnicity, **when the data lends itself to such disaggregation."**

When Ask VA migrates to VA.gov, we will continue to ask for preferred `Pronouns`. Pronouns more accurately describe how to address the submitter and/or refer to the person who an inquiry is about.

## We do not need to collect gender identity, because: 
- **It does not benefit the user experience** - We will still collect preferred `Pronouns`, which let agents know how to address the submitter and/or refer to the person who the inquiry is about.
- **It is not mandated by law** - Disaggregation by gender is only necessary if the data is collected in the first place.

Therefore, we recommend that this field is removed.
