# Recommendation for removing `Gender` collection from Ask VA

Last updated by @tygindraux: January 9, 2024

**Update:** On [January 9, 2024](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/research/Business%20line%20engagement/Center%20for%20Women%20Veterans/January%209,%202024.md), we met with the Center for Women Veterans. We determined that we will require gender identity for all categories in Ask VA. We will collect the gender of the submitter.

This decision overrules our previous proposal below, which we'll leave for documentation purposes.

## Previous proposal to remove Gender

We recommend not collecting `Gender` when we migrate Ask VA to VA.gov.

### VA.gov Design System
The [VA.gov Design System](https://design.va.gov/patterns/ask-users-for/gender) provides clear guidance to only ask for gender identity if it benefits the user experience: 
> **"Donâ€™t ask if it does not benefit the user experience.** You should only ask users about gender when absolutely necessary."

> "**We don't use [gender] at all.** Especially if someone has pronouns. Most of our responses are auto-generated. We don't pull reports about this or anything like that. We don't use it." - Ask VA agent from VBA

### Mandate by law?
The Center for Women Veterans (CWV) did share a [Federal law](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/PLAW-116publ315) with their understanding of why we must collect `Gender` information from submitters. However, after reviewing the law, we find that it only mandates collection of gender information when gender information is available in the dataset:
> "...disaggregate such data by gender, race, and ethnicity, **when the data lends itself to such disaggregation."**

When Ask VA migrates to VA.gov, we will continue to ask for preferred `Pronouns`. Pronouns more accurately describe how to address the submitter and/or refer to the person who an inquiry is about.

### We do not need to collect gender identity, because: 
- **It does not benefit the user experience** - We will still collect preferred `Pronouns`, which let agents know how to address the submitter and/or refer to the person who the inquiry is about.
- **It is not mandated by law** - Disaggregation by gender is only necessary if the data is collected in the first place.

Therefore, we recommend that this field is removed.
