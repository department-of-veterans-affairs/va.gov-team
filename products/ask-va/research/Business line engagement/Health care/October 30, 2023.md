# October 30, 2023: VHA-HAC business line review

*Ask VA Integration Team*

## Agenda

- Intro: 5 minutes
- Discuss topic and subtopic names: 20 minutes

## Attendees

- Our team: Becky, Tyler, Ruchi
- VHA-HAC: Brian Guenther
- CRM team: Wayne, Chris, Shelby, Wandy, Maria

## Key takeaways

- We discussed each of the topic and subtopic names that HAC is responsible for and agreed on revised names. We used Laura Willwerth's revisions and comments to guide the discussion, which are summarized here.
- `Health and Medical Programs for Family Members`
  - Laura: The page is ”Family health benefits” on VA.gov, so we recommend keeping it as `Family health benefits`. But I'm interested in learning more about the reason for your proposed name.
  - Brian: We used the term "Family member health benefit programs" when we’re in meetings or with customers. Can we compromise and add family **member**?
  - Agreed on: `Family member health benefits`
- `CHAMPVA CITI (Family Member VA Care)`
  - Laura: I suggest rewording this to `Getting care at a VA health facility through CHAMPVA CITI`. I checked VA site search analytics, and the acronym has higher search volume than the spelled-out name of the program. So this would be the best way to include both (1) the program name and (2) explanation of what it is, without making the label too long.
  - Brian: Good!
  - Agreed on: `Getting care at a VA health facility through CHAMPVA CITI`
- `Spina Bifida Health Care Benefits Program`
  - Laura: Thanks for sharing the nuance between the two programs. We suggest just a slight change to `Spina Bifida Health Care Benefits Program or Children of Woman Vietnam Veterans Health Care Benefits Program`. We agree we don’t want to give the full name of one and not the other.
  - Brian: Great. We don't need to change routing, also. If you’re inquiring about Spina Bifida you can also inquire about CWVV.
  - Agreed on: `Spina Bifida Health Care Benefits Program or Children of Woman Vietnam Veterans Health Care Benefits Program`
