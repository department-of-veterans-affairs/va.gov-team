This list is alphabetized by category name.

## How this pattern works

When a submitter can choose between ≥ 2 contact options, we need to include a question that captures their contact preference. Here's an example from [Ask VA - Sketch - Health care](https://sketch.com/s/6a75d0a2-e484-4f1e-8675-ad5747a1a871). You can also reference this [pattern in the VA.gov design system](https://design.va.gov/patterns/ask-users-for/contact-preferences).

When a submitter cannot choose between ≥ 2 contact options, for example, only email is `ENABLED`, this question is omitted from the form. In this case, we need to update the submission page to let a submitter know how they can expect to be contacted. Here's an example from [Ask VA - Sketch - Education](https://sketch.com/s/7e494761-be10-4aef-a268-a45a02fbc5c3).
