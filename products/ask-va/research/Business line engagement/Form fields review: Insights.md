# Form fields review: Insights

## Background

We are proposing to remove some fields from the Ask VA form. As part of this process, we have reviewed these fields with all business lines to gather their feedback. This document summarizes our findings from those reviews.

## Insights

### Tell us the reason you're contacting us? (*Required)

- Despite being a required field for all categories, most agents aren't familiar with this field. This implies they are not using it help answer inquiries.
- In theory this field could be useful for receiving complaints and compliments. 
- But, most inquiries are 'questions' and 'complaint' might be too broad to be useful.
- Town Hall is very uncommonly seen by agents.
> **Takeaway: Continue with recommendation to remove this field.**

### How should we get in touch with you? (*Required)
- We validated which business lines currently don't offer all contact options; and found some new ones:
  - Email and phone only: Caregiver support (Current), DEERS can't easily send mail (Potential)
  - Email only: Education (Current), Audiology only responds via the form (Potential), VIC is email only (Potential), ECM (Eligibility) is email only (Current)
> **Takeaway: Do not continue with recommendation to remove this field.**

> **Takeaway: Create a new ticket to verify contact options with all business lines.**

### Veteran service information fields
- [See Mural diagram](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1695240274364/2cf06cfdc9c4e2e154d97f44223b25ece7840a4c?wid=0-1695249362794) for details of findings.
> **Takeaway: Continue with recommendation to remove most fields apart from SSN and DOB.**

> **Takeaway: _Or_ gather more comprehensive feedback from business lines before we recommend removal.**
