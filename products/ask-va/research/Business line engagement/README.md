# About this research

## Study
This is ongoing research with VA business lines. There is no associated issue in the [Research Repository](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/880).

## Background
Ask VA (AVA) is an online portal that allows Veterans, caregivers, and supporting personnel in education, debt, loans, etc. to submit questions to VA and receive a secure message response. Currently, Ask VA (AVA) resides within a stand-alone Microsoft portal that is inconsistent with the VA design standards, is not mobile-friendly, and has accessibility issues.

We need to meet with business lines to determine which fields are required in order for agents to deliver the service and receive their feedback about proposed updates to Ask VA.
