## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is `TYLER or BECKY`, I’m a researcher from the VA.

I work on improving VA.gov so it's easier for Veterans to contact the VA online if they have a question.

What I hope to do today is get a sense of how we can make this process better.

What I don't want to do is add to any frustration that may have led you to contact the VA - or even frustration you've had with actually contacting the VA - in the past. I want to be up front and say that I don't have a way of fixing those past experiences. But, I do want to know about your frustrations in case they're things we can improve in the future.

Now before we get started, there are a few other things I want to mention:

* **This session should take about an hour.** I will make sure we don’t spend longer than that, and so I may occasionally move us along to the next question or topic so we can cover everything.
* **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We’re not testing your ability. And I want you to know that I’m not going to be offended by any opinions you express, I'm here to get your feedback.
* **I’m going to share a prototype with you today.** This is like a pretend version of the website, and so it may not function exactly the way you expect. For example, you’ll be able to click some buttons or links, but not all of them. And there’s certain things you’ll read that might not match what you see on the VA’s real website today.
* **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, you just have to let me know.** And that might be a pause to get some water or to stop the session completely. You'll be paid even if we don't complete the full session.
* When they set up this session, Perigean asked if you are okay with a couple of observers joining us. **I want to confirm with you now, are you okay with a couple of observers joining this session?**
    * `IF NO` Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
    * `IF YES` Great, they're in the waiting room so I'm going to let them into the meeting now.

> Admit observers and let them introduce themselves before turning off their cameras.

* Next I’d like to ask you about recordings. We use recordings to confirm that we’ve captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we finish the study, and none of your comments are attributed to you directly. **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
    * `IF NO` Don't record
    * `IF YES` Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

> Start recording: `RECORD TO CLOUD`.

> Click `LIVE TRANSCRIPT` and `ENABLE` or `SHOW CAPTIONS`.

* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?**

## Agenda - 60 minutes

* Warm up - 5 minutes
* Submit an inquiry - 30 minutes
* View and sort dashboard - 10 minutes
* Open an ongoing inquiry - 5 minutes
* Start a reply - 5 minutes
* Wrap up - 3 minutes
* Thank you - 2 minutes

## Warm up - 5 minutes

I'd like to start by learning more about your experience with the VA and our online services.

* How often do you go online to use VA services, such as, schedule a medical appointment or check your benefits?
* Have you ever contacted the VA online or over the phone?
    * `IF NO` Why might you contact the VA?
    * `IF YES`
        * Can you tell me about a time when you contacted the VA?
        * Do you usually contact the VA `OVER THE PHONE OR ONLINE`? Why?
        * How do you usually contact the VA? Why?
        * `IF ONLINE` Did you use your phone, tablet or computer?
        * How did you find the support you received `OVER THE PHONE OR ONLINE`?

#### Things to watch for:

* How do they decide which channel to use when they contact the VA?
* Do they specify the device they use (tablet, mobile, desktop)?

## Submit an inquiry - 30 minutes

Thanks, it’s helpful to learn about your experience with the VA.

Next, I’d like to share some ideas with you so we can get your feedback.

In the Zoom chat, I'm going to send you a link to a prototype. I mentioned earlier a prototype is like a pretend version of a website. It might not work perfectly, but this way we can learn what we need to improve before we share it with all Veterans.

> Send link in Zoom chat.

* Can you please open the link in the chat?
* Have you shared your screen on Zoom before?
    * `IF YES` Great. Can you please share your screen?
    * `IF NO` I’ll walk you through how to do that...

Thanks! Now I’m able to see your screen too.

### 1: Start page

Now that we have this open, I'd like us to start by imagining that you need to ask the VA a question. Let's say it's a question about your health care.

Great, thank you! Those are all of the questions I have for you today.

## Thank you - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Pause or exit strategies

#### If the participant isn't feeling well.

I'm sorry you're `NOT FEELING WELL`. Do you feel up for continuing? You'll be paid even if we stop early.

`If they choose to continue` Okay, just let me know if you change your mind.

#### If the participant is showing signs of upset or distress.

This sounds so hard. Would you like to take a break or stop?

`If they choose to take a break and come back` Welcome back. I'm interested to hear more about... are you up for continuing or would you prefer we move to the next topic?

#### If the participant decides to stop.

Thank you for time on this call, I completely understand your decision to stop.

`If they seem distressed` Before you go, the VA Hotline number is 988, it's a confidential helpline, and it's 24/7. It's up to you whether you call.

#### If the participant is fine to continue, but you aren't.

I hear that you're okay to continue. Before we do, I realized that I need a minute. I'm going to turn off my camera and microphone, and get a glass of water. Is that okay with you? I'll be back in 3 minutes.

`If you're still not able to continue` Thanks for letting me take a break. You didn't do anything wrong, but I'm realizing that I'm not going to be able to continue this session. You will still be paid for the full time. I really appreciate you sharing with me today. Is it okay with you if we stop? Thanks very much.
