## Background

Ask VA (AVA) is an online portal that allows Veterans, caregivers and others to submit questions to VA and receive a secure response. Currently, AVA resides within a stand-alone Microsoft portal that is inconsistent with VA design standards, is not mobile-friendly, and has accessibility issues. 

We need to move AVA to VA.gov. It should be mobile friendly, accessible and easy to submit an issue and receive updates and information that results in a final resolution. Ultimately, we want AVA to feel part of a cohesive and user-centered approach to support. This [product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/products/Ask-VA-MVP-1-Product-Outline.md) includes more details about our MVP scope.

### OCTO priorities

This research supports the following OCTO priorities:

* Solidify the VA.gov platform
* Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience

### Veteran journey

Ask VA can support Veterans, caregivers and other submitters at all stages of the Veteran journey, from starting up to aging.

## Research goals

The key goals of this study are to:

* Review whether submitters can successfully submit an inquiry
* Review whether submitters have the information they need when reviewing an ongoing inquiry
* Review whether submitters can reply to an inquiry

**Note:** In our research documentation, the words `user` and `submitter` are used interchangeably.

### Outcome

This research will help us determine if and how we need to improve the design and content of our MVP.

### Research questions

Review whether submitters can successfully submit an inquiry:
* Is it clear when users need to authenticate or when it’s optional?
* Are users missing information on any question, page or sequence of pages?
* Are there too many or too few fields per page?
* Do users understand why they're being asked each question?
* Do users understand how to edit their answers on the review page?
* Is it clear what to expect after they submit an inquiry?

Review whether submitters have the information they need when reviewing an ongoing inquiry:
* Are users missing any information to identify an inquiry in their dashboard?
* How and how often do users expect to be updated about changes to their inquiry status?

Review whether submitters can reply to an inquiry:
* What do users expect to happen after you receive a response to their inquiry?
* Is it clear how to respond to VA if you need (and are able) to follow up?

### Hypotheses

1. Some users will think authentication is required in order to ask _any_ question.
2. Most users will find the form straightforward and intuitive.
3. Most users will understand how long the form is and their progress.
4. Some users will be confused about which information they can edit on the review page and which they cannot.
5. Most users will expect an estimate of how long it will take to receive a reply.
6. When reviewing an inquiry, most users will need to know the date they submitted, their question and its current status.
7. Most users will prefer to receive email notifications when the status of their ongoing inquiry changes.
8. Once they receive a response from VA about their inquiry, some users will expect to reply back.
9. If users aren’t able to reply back to an inquiry, some people will submit a new inquiry to follow up.
10. Users will find it useful to see the latest thread in the conversation while they type their reply.

## Methodology

This will be a moderated usability study conducted remotely over Zoom. We will use a coded prototype in staging.

We will test:
1. Submit an inquiry
2. Sort and filter dashboard
3. Open an ongoing inquiry
4. Reply to VA
