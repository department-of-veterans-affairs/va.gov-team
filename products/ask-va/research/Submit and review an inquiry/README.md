# About this research

## Study
This research has not started yet. There is no associated issue in the [Research Repository](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/880).

## Background
Ask VA (AVA) is an online portal that allows Veterans, caregivers and others to submit questions to VA and receive a secure response. Currently, AVA resides within a stand-alone Microsoft portal that is inconsistent with VA design standards, is not mobile-friendly, and has accessibility issues.

We need to move AVA to VA.gov. It should be mobile friendly, accessible and easy to submit an issue and receive updates and information that results in a final resolution. Ultimately, we want AVA to feel part of a cohesive and user-centered approach to support. This product outline includes more details about our MVP scope.

## Research goals
* Review whether submitters can successfully submit an inquiry
* Review whether submitters have the information they need when reviewing an ongoing inquiry
* Review whether submitters can reply to an inquiry

## Recruitment
We will recruit Veterans and dependents through Perigean, including low vision or blind participants who use screen readers. We will also recruit 2 School Certifying Officials and 1 Work Study Supervisor independently.

## Date
This research will take place in January 2024.
