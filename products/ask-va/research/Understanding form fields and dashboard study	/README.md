# About this research

## Study
This research has not started yet. There is no associated issue in the [Research Repository](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/880).

## Background
Ask VA (AVA) is an online portal that allows Veterans, caregivers, and supporting personnel in education, debt, loans, etc. to submit questions to VA and receive a secure message response. Currently, Ask VA (AVA) resides within a stand-alone Microsoft portal that is inconsistent with the VA design standards, is not mobile-friendly, and has accessibility issues.

Through moderated usability testing with users we will use high-fidelity Sketch prototype(s) to learn how they expect to answer questions, review a past or ongoing inquiry and get help if they encounter an issue.

This will likely be tested on mobile.

## Research Goals
* Understand how users expect to answer questions and in which order
* Understand what users expect to see when they review a past or ongoing inquiry
* Understand whether users know where to get help or what they will do if they encounter an issue

## Recruitment
We will recruit through Perigean.

## Date
This research is likely to start in July 2023.
