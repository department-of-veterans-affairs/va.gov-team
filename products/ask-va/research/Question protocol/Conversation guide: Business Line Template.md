# Conversation Guide: BUSINESS LINE TEMPLATE
*Ask VA, June 2023*

Last updated by @tygindraux: June 28, 2023

## Background

Our goal is to **understand which fields are necessary in order for agents to deliver Ask VA (AVA)**. These are our research questions:

* Who uses the answers to each question in this form?
* What do they use the answers to each question for?
* Which fields are required in order to answer a query?
* If an answer is required, what happens if a user enters something random in order to get through the form?
* Why are optional questions part of the form?
* How does this process differ across use cases (or categories and topics), if at all?
* What makes it take longer to offer a response to the user?

## Prepare

### 1-2 days before the session
- [ ] Create a new folder [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/ask-va/research/Question%20protocol) and name it the business line or category name, here's an [example](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/ask-va/research/Question%20protocol/Health)
- [ ] Make a copy of the conversation guide and replace 'BUSINESS LINE TEMPLATE' with the business line or category name
- [ ] Review existing materials about the business line in the Teams channel or the [CRM Team (temporary) folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1IVjqkz-xGvdZt2wEVoinNscZUrGQHzej) and add notes to the guide, if needed
- [ ] Add questions relevant to the specific business line, if any
- [ ] Ensure prototype(s) are ready to go
- [ ] Designate a facilitator and notetaker

### Day of the session
- [ ] Open the prototype and be ready to screen share
- [ ] Open the conversation guide

### Starting the session
- [ ] Ask if everyone is okay with recording, and if so, start recording

## Agenda - 60 minutes

* Set up: 5 minutes
* Background: 15 minutes
* Review form: 25 minutes
* Category, topics and sub-topics: 10 minutes
* Wrap up: 5 minutes

## Set up - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining. Today is a chance for us to learn more about how Ask VA works. In particular, we'd like to understand how agents use the details in each inquiry to reply to an inquiry. Understanding your process will help us improve the AVA form.

* Before we start, can everyone on your team introduce themselves? If you can share your name and your role, please.
    * *Note: If the invite list is over 5 people from their team, we should skip this.*

## Background - 15 minutes

I'd like to start by learning about the type of inquiries you're responsible for.

* Which types of inquiries does your team answer?
* What makes it easier to answer an inquiry?
* What makes it difficult?
   * What makes it take longer to answer a particular inquiry?
* There's a question in the current AVA that asks the reason someone is getting in touch. They can say, ‘compliment, question, town hall,’ and so on. How do you use this information to help answer a submitter's question?
   * We've heard that this field is often answered incorrectly, so the data isn't used much. We recommend removing this question. What do you think about removing this question? Why?
* *Add any specific questions for this business line*

## Review form: 35 minutes

Next, we're going to share our screen and ask for your feedback. This is an updated version of AVA that we've been working on.

> Share screen with Sketch prototype

### Start page

This is the start page. We're going to imagine that someone starts by signing in. I'm going to skip ahead to the first page of the form now.

### Select a category, topic and sub-topic

I'd like to ask a couple questions about this screen now. On this screen, the user chooses a category, topic and sub-topic. This is very similar to the current AVA.

* Do you face any issues related to the current categories, topics and sub-topics in Ask VA?
   * For example, do submitters ever choose the incorrect category?
   * Can you share an example of when this (or something else) happened?
* Is there anything on this page that you would change? Why?
* *Add any specific questions for this business line*

### Tell us about your question

On this screen, the user tells us more about their inquiry.

* When a users says they are a Veteran, dependent or submitting on behalf of a Veteran, does that change how you reply? If so, how?
* We noticed that if someone says they are submitting a general question, they need to provide their zip code. Do you know why a zip code is required?
* Do you have any issues with the current free-text box, where users can write their inquiry in their own words?
* Do you receive documents that submitters upload with their inquiry?
    * If yes, do you face any issues with this?
    * If not, could this be useful? How?
* Is there anything on this page that you would change? Why?
* *Add any specific questions for this business line*

### Additional details

On this screen, the user shares more about themselves.

* Why do you need to know whether any submitter is a VA employee?
* Is there anything on this page that you would change? Why?
* *Add any specific questions for this business line*
  
### Your information

On this screen, the user gives us their contact information.

* How do you reply to submitter's? For example, over the phone, email, or US Mail.
    * We noticed that submitter's can choose which contact method they prefer. If they choose to be contacted over the phone, will you only contact them that way?
    * Is there any circumstance where you would call them instead?
* Is there anything on this page that you would change? Why?
* *Add any specific questions for this business line*

### Review and send

At the end, the user will have the chance to review their information before they submit.

* Is there anything on this page that you would change? Why?
* *Add any specific questions for this business line*
  
### Submitted

Finally, they will submit their inquiry and we'll tell them what to expect next.

* How long does it usually take you to reply to an inquiry?
    * Are you comfortable with us stating that it takes up to 7 business days to reply to an inquiry? 
* Is there anything on this page that you would change? Why?
* *Add any specific questions for this business line*

## Category, topics and subtopics - 10 minutes

Before we finish, there’s something else we’d like to get your feedback on. We’ve reviewed the list of categories, topics and subtopics and made suggestions for how to update these so they are consistent with content on VA.gov. This will not affect how the queries are routed to the correct queue.

> Share screen with spreadsheet

* First, the category is currently named [current category name]. We suggest changing this to [proposed category name].
   * How do you feel about this change?
* Next, here are the topics in this category, and on the right you can see our proposed changes.
   * How do you feel about these changes?
   * Is there any one that sticks out to you?
* Finally, there are subtopics within [this topic]. Here are our proposed changes to the subtopics.
   * How do you feel about these changes?
   * Is there any one that sticks out to you?
* *Add any specific questions for this business line*

### Wrap up - 5 minutes

Thanks for reviewing this with us. It's really helpful to get your feedback.

* Before we finish, is there anything else you want to share with us?
* Do you have any hesitations about anything we showed you today?
* Do you have any questions for us?
* *Any specific questions for this business line?*
