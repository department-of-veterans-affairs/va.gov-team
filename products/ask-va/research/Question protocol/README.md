# About this research

## Study
This is ongoing research with VA business lines. There is no associated issue in the [Research Repository](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/880).

## Background
Ask VA (AVA) is an online portal that allows Veterans, caregivers, and supporting personnel in education, debt, loans, etc. to submit questions to VA and receive a secure message response. Currently, Ask VA (AVA) resides within a stand-alone Microsoft portal that is inconsistent with the VA design standards, is not mobile-friendly, and has accessibility issues.

We need to determine which fields are required in order for agents to deliver the service, which is often called a [question protocol](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2010/06/the-question-protocol-how-to-make-sure-every-form-field-is-necessary.php). In order to do this, we will meet with different business lines and share Sketch prototypes for feedback and discussion. We also reviewed agent's responses to a monthly survey, to learn more about what is and is not working for them.

This work involves ongoing technical meetings with the CRM team to determine routing rules and limitations.

## Research Goals
* Understand which fields are necessary in order for agents to deliver the service
* Understand which fields are necessary in order to route queries to the right place

## Recruitment
We will meet with relevant business lines across VA as well as the Ask VA CRM team. 

## Date
This research is ongoing, starting in June 2023.
