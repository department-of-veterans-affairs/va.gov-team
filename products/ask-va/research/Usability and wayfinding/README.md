# About this research

## Study
This research has not started yet. There is no associated issue in the [Research Repository](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/880).

## Background
Ask VA (AVA) is an online portal that allows Veterans, caregivers, and supporting personnel in education, debt, loans, etc. to submit questions to VA and receive a secure message response. Currently, Ask VA (AVA) resides within a stand-alone Microsoft portal that is inconsistent with the VA design standards, is not mobile-friendly, and has accessibility issues.

Through moderated usability testing with users we should use a coded prototype(s) to review whether they can find Ask VA around VA.gov, authenticate if necessary or desired, and successfully submit and review inquiries. We will include screen reader users in this study.

## Research Goals
* Review whether users can successfully submit and review an inquiry
* Review where Ask VA should live and be linked to from
* Review how users experience authentication

## Recruitment
We will recruit through Perigean.

## Date
This research is likely to start in October-November 2023.
