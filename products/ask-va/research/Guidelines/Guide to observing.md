## Before the session

* Remind yourself of the research objectives.
* Clear your space, find your headphones and mute distractions, like Slack notifications.
* Sign in to Zoom and change the display name to your first or preferred name.
* Open (or join) `#feedback-backchannel` on DSVA Slack and find the thread for your session.
* If you signed up to take notes during the session:
    * open the notes board in Mural (you can find a link in the meeting invitation or `#feedback-backchannel` thread)
    * find your session on the board

## At the start of the session

* Join the Zoom waiting room. Before you're admitted, the moderator will ask for the participant's consent to have you and other observers join the session.
    * If they say no, the moderator will message on `#feedback-backchannel` and you can leave the call.
    * If they say yes, the moderator will admit you to the meeting.
* Join the meeting with your **camera on** and **microphone off**.
* The moderator will verbally introduce you and the other observers. If there's time, the moderator will ask you to say hello. Otherwise you can keep your **microphone off**.
* After introductions, the moderator will ask you to turn your **camera off** and **microphone off** for the rest of the session.

## Throughout the session

* Don't use the Zoom chat. Instead, use your session's ðŸ§µ in `#feedback-backchannel`.
* If you signed up to take notes:
    * take (as close to as possible) verbatim notes
    * delay interpreting what's happening or jumping to solutions
    * use a new sticky note for each moment or idea
    * don't worry about typos or mistakes
    * try to capture everything, but if you miss something (1) don't stress and (2) make note of this so the moderator can go back and fill in the details

### If something goes wrong

* The moderator's number one priority is to **keep the participant safe** or **avoid doing additional harm**.
* If a participant appears distressed, they will take a moment to check in with them, offer to move on and skip the question or topic, or they'll suggest taking a short break.
* If a participant continues to give signs of distress, the researcher will follow an emergency exit strategy that they have prepared for.
* If a participant experiences a medical or psychological emergency, then the researcher will follow [a protocol](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-safety-and-emergency-exit-strategies#Researchsafetyandemergencyexitstrategies-Requestingemergencyassistance) to request assistance.
* As a notetaker, it's also important to look after yourself during research. If you no longer feel safe or capable to continue taking notes, you should feel empowered to exit the call. You can message the moderator (personally or in `#feedback-backchannel` and let them know you left). They will check in with you after the session finishes.

## At the end of the session

* Continue to keep your **camera off** and **microphone muted** even at the end of the session.

## After the session

* After each session, we will have an optional 10 minute debrief. Please rejoin the same meeting link.
* If you signed up to take notes:
  * add details or decode acronyms in your notes, if needed
  * write your top 3-5 key takeaways at the top of your notes
* If you have further questions or comments for the moderator, reach out to them directly.
