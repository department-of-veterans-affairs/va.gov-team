This guide is based on:

* [VA.gov Platform: Research safety and emergency exit strategies](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-safety-and-emergency-exit-strategies#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Creatingasafespaceforparticipants)

* [VA Trauma Community of Practice: Learnings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/shared-support/trauma/notes/2023-03-06.md)

## Before the session

* Review the conversation guide and have it ready.
* Review the prototype and have it ready.
* Clear your space, find your headphones and mute distractions, like Slack notifications. Be prepared to have your camera on.
* Sign in to the Perigean Zoom meeting (you will be the host) and change the display name to your first name.
* Turn on transcriptions by clicking `LIVE TRANSCRIPT` in the bottom toolbar. Then, in the `Live Transcription` section, click `ENABLE`.
* Open the `#feedback-backchannel` on DSVA Slack. Start a thread, like this:

      P1 - Ask VA: Round 1 research starts in 10 minutes 🧵

* Copy these instructions into the thread:

      How to observe this session:
      
      * If you're notetaking, review [these guidelines](add link) before you join.
      * If you're observing, review [these guidelines](add link) before you join.
      * Open [this Mural board](add link).
      * Once (if) the participant agrees to have you join, I'll let you in from the Zoom waiting room.
      * Use this 🧵 and don't use the Zoom chat. Thanks!

## At the start of the session

* Turn your camera on, but don't require the participant to turn their camera on, it's up to them. If they choose to have their camera off, ask if they'd prefer you turn your camera off too.
* If the participant doesn't show up in the first few minutes, reach out to Perigean on Slack.
* Go through the consent process slowly and intentionally. Remind the participant of their autonomy and choice.
* You can *only* record the session if the participant gives you permission to record. Once you start recording, you must let the participant know they're being recorded and have them acknowledge that they give permission. Remember to choose `record to cloud`.
* If the participant agrees to have observers join, let them in from the waiting room. They should have their cameras on while you introduce them to the participant. Then, ask all observers to turn off their cameras so you can begin.

## Throughout the session

* Follow your participant’s lead in how they self-identify. Use the words they use to describe themselves.
* Continue to provide opportunities for refusal throughout the study. For example, if you’re asking a sensitive question, remind the participant that it is optional.
* Leave space for the participant to share their questions, reactions and experiences. Silence can be helpful to allow someone time to think.
* If someone asks you how something works or what happens when they click on something, remember that we're here to learn from them, not to give them advice or onboard them to a new product. It can help to say something like, "I'm wondering, how would you expect it to work?" instead of answering the question.
* When a participant, particularly a Veteran, shares a tough experience with you, show compassion but avoid unpacking trauma (which, as researchers, we're not prepared to do safely). It often helps to say something like, "I'm so sorry that happened to you" or "that sounds very frustrating," and artfully redirect back to your script. Remember that keeping to our [scope of practice](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/teams/shared-support/trauma) can help avoid causing additional harm.
* If you don't know the answer to something you can say something, like, "I'm not sure. But I'll ask Perigean to share a link to the VA's support line, so you can get the right help." It helps to remind the participant of your role and what you can or can't help them with.
* Keep an eye on the `#feedback-backchannel` in case there are questions you should add.

### If something goes wrong

* Our number one priority as researchers is to **keep the participant safe** or **avoid doing additional harm**.
* If a participant appears distressed, take a moment to check in. You can start by offering to move on and skip the question or topic, or suggest taking a short break.
* If they continue to give signs of distress, follow the emergency exit strategies in the conversation guide.
* If you find yourself in a session with a participant experiencing a medical or psychological emergency, then you need to follow [this protocol](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-safety-and-emergency-exit-strategies#Researchsafetyandemergencyexitstrategies-Requestingemergencyassistance) to request assistance.
* As the moderator, it's also important to look after yourself during research. If you no longer feel safe or capable to continue, refer to the guidelines at the end of your conversation guide.
* If there's an incident like this, then afterwards you should follow [this protocol](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-safety-and-emergency-exit-strategies#Researchsafetyandemergencyexitstrategies-Creatingasafespaceforresearchmoderators) and reach out to a lead researcher on your team asap.

## At the end of the session

* Say thank you with intention. Remind the participant that our team couldn't do this work without their wisdom and help.
* Ask the participant how they are feeling. Give them time to debrief and use this time to transition out of the session.
* Glance at the `#feedback-backchannel` in case there is anything that needs to be addressed before you finish.
* Inform the participant of what they can expect next, including information about payment and further contact from you or Perigean.

## After the session

* After each session, we will have an optional 10 minute debrief. This reflection is helpful for the whole team, but particularly for the moderator if you have a difficult conversation during a session.
* After the session, review the `#feedback-backchannel` and notes in Mural. It can be helpful to add your own reflections while they're still fresh.
* Perigean will keep the recordings for up to 1 week following the study. Your lead researcher will download any recordings needed and follow [these guidelines](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recording-user-research-sessions) to handle recordings safely.
