# API Integration Status

## Notes
* AVA CRM Team maintains an API Contract document that lives separately from this repo.
* The documentation here is kept in sync with the AVA CRM Team API Contract document
* The endpoints described here are between AVA FE's backend and external system endpoints
    *  When source is "Dynamics", that is an endpoint being developed by the AVA CRM Team
    *  When source is "Lighthouse", that is an endpoint that exists in [VA Lighthouse APIs](https://developer.va.gov/explore)
    *  When source is "VA Profile", that is referring to the VA.Gov Profile system

## Process
1) When working on syncing documentation the phase will be "design".
2) When documentation sync is complete, the phase will go to "ready for dev" with a yellow circle until development starts.
3) When documentation sync is complete, the phase will go to "development" with a yellow box.
4) When an endpoint is deployed to staging, the box will go green and the phase will go to "integration".
5) When integration testing is complete and the endpoint has been deployed to production, the status will go to "production"
