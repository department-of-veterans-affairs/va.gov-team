### Random Notecard Notes

* Might the Review Instance on the VA.gov side be useful as a semi-long-lived server instance?
* Ask Platform if they have similar exp? Many may have had environment mismatching?
* Ask TravelPay team for their exp?
* Khoa and Kyle's JSON exchange, automated? OR repo of JSON files to share?
Postman / Insomnia as a part of this flow?
* tool to post selection of JSON that was captured from E2E testing?
* CRM's QA Engineer lives in their INT environment.
  * E2E... CRM is manual today. Each environment has it's own instance of the portal today.
  * Simulates the actual vet experience.
  * CRM Test process needs UI to test their changes
  * As a part of the testing, the UI's logic is naturally tested in the QA process.
  * Minimize potential impact to testing? Silo data by specific users for each team?
* Automated tests
  * Automated testing in this env. is harder because of tooling?
  * Postman replaces VA.gov portal for unconnected instances?
  * Gateway for automated testing of API / contracts?
* Deployments
  * CRM has github action to import the solution into higher envs.
  * QA happens long before PROD deploy. Changes might invalidate her testing. ex: form logic changes.
* Karl to provide links for contract testing in [#ask-va-integration](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C06LN37RT47).\
