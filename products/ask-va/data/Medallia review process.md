# Medallia review process

Last updated by @enaids: December 2025

This document describes how we plan to review Medallia feedback to improve Ask VA. It continues to evolve as we streamline processes and iron out details between teams.

## Types of feedback

We collect qualitative unmoderated feedback from submitters and staff who use Ask VA.

These different types of feedback are often referred to as:

- VSignals: Feedback from Veterans or other submitters who use Ask VA
- ESignals: Feedback from staff who answer inquiries and support the delivery of Ask VA

VSignals and ESignals are both powered by Medallia.

## During launch

### Frequency

During launch, we will review feedback daily. We will focus on VSignals feedback.

### Process

1. Becky will export VSignals feedback to Excel daily.
2. Towards the  end of each day, Becky and Tyler will review asynchronously and highlight any notable items from the daily export. (Becky will also monitor in real-time to report any urgent issues.)
3. Becky and/or Tyler will post any notable feedback on the #ask-va-integration Slack channel, including any relevant details, suggested action items, questions and tag relevant team members.
4. Relevant team members will discuss the issue in a Slack thread. Once we agree on any action item(s), we will tag Ariel to create a ticket.
5. After a ticket is created, we will add a link to the ticket in the Excel feedback sheet, so we track how we're responding to notable feedback.

## After launch

### Frequency

After launch, we will continue to monitor feedback monthly and include it in a comprehensive Metrics + Feedback report with the following information. This report will be presented to AVA POs on a quarterly basis. 
- Overall Engagement (Inquiries submitted, top categories and topics, etc.) 
- [Performance KPIs](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/product/KPIs.md#performance-kpis)
- Veteran Feedback (Satisfaction ratings and qualitative feedback)
- Actionable Next Steps

### Overall Process

1. Elena will export VSignals feedback to Excel after the month closes out.  
2. Identify and tag feedback by pain points themes as defined below
3. Becky to review actionability and next steps with Elena
    a. Populate actionable data in spreadsheet for Business Lines  
5. Populate data and findings in the Metrics + Feedback report ([template]([url](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/AskVA/Shared%20Documents/General/Data/Other%20analyses/Metrics%20+%20Feedback%20proposed%20template.pptx?d=w90ba3b257b364da7bfc2338776c98692&csf=1&web=1&e=VDonPZ))) 
    a. Stephanie will update KPIs
    b. Elena will update Overall engagement and Feedback 
6. Share report and spreadsheet with VA POs and Business lines via Slack, Teams, and email distribution list
7. All reports will be available on both GitHub and SharePoint
 
## Tagging

### Pain Points 

When analyzing feedback, we will tag pain points themes for all items received to better understand the biggest pain points users are experiencing. 

**Not pain points** - The feedback button's open text field is answering the question "What task were you trying to do today?", so many responses are generic
> Ask a question.
  
> Get answers.
    
**Pain points, but can't be addressed by AVA** - There is also a single individual submitting similar feedback daily or more. We include these responses in the satisfaction ratings, but don't include them in pain point themes. 
> VA advocate has totally screwed me for over a year
  
> Is Muscogee Education omniscience above and beyond ever making a mistake?
    
#### AVA related pain point, in one of the predefined categories (Listed in order of prevelance)

_[These pain point categories were created based on previous synthesis of Ask VA's experience challenges

| Pain Point Theme | Description | 
| :--------------- | :--------- | 
| Poor Replies     | Long wait times, and impersonal canned responses that aren't helpful.   | 
| Confusing channels   | Indistinguishable support channels, so it's hard to know which to use for each individual need.   | 
| Login friction      | Veterans and Veteran families experience complicated login processes, while school officials experience conflicts between their business and personal credentials.      | 
| Overcomplicated inbox    | Reviewing responses and submissions is challenging for all submitters.      | 
| Form overload    | Multiple, cumbersome steps are required for users to submit simple inquiries.      | 
| Unclear categories    | Choosing the correct category, topic, and subtopic is challenging and can prevent an inquiry from being submitted.      |
| Submission inconsistency    | Submitting documentation for busines line processes varies, causing confusion and incorrect submissions.      | 
 
 **Potential AVA related pain point, but “other” as of now** Sub-themes identified
  - Appointments
  - Can't find information
  - Claims status / issues
  - GI Bill / Education status
  - ID Cards
  - Prescription refills / medical supplies
  - Secure messaging
  - Survivor benefits
  - System performance
  - Travel pay

### Actionability
When identifying next steps, we will focus on feedback that is actionable. Meaning, teams or business lines can use this feedback to consider changes or improvements to make to the technology, processes or workflows that support Ask VA.
We will tag actionable feedback with relevant partners. For example, if we get feedback that a topic name is confusing, we will tag this with VA.gov and Business lines.

Determining if it can be actionable:
- Based on the URL
  - If the URL contains an inquiry number, flag which team can address it directly (Need access to CRM to view inquiry and queue)
- Based on content of feedback
  - Remove unrelated, non-pain point feedback and those that are not specific enough to action
  - Flag any feedback that is specific enough to be addressed by the Veteran Facing Team, the Agent Facing Team, or specific Business Lines
  - Add notes to categorize the potential action grouping further
    - Can we do anything about feedback for people who are waiting for replies?

### Future improvements
- **VA Staff feedback** - We are not currently monitoring ESignals feedback from VA staff. We would like to include this in future processes and reports
- **Reply metrics** - We would like to collect and monitor reply rate and time to reply in the future. Once this data is being reported, we will add to our future reports.
- **New categories** - Can the "Other" pain point themes help us identify other categories, topics, and sub-topics that submitters may need?
