## Takeaways from 9/16 conversation

The frontend team met with Jaime Rocha and Natalie Morales on 9/16/25 to learn more about this field. 

- Point of contact for Office of Patient Advocacy (OPA) is Ron Hammer
- All VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) have Patient Advocates who can respond to questions in the PATSR CRM
- Not all VA clinics have Patient Advocates, but some do
- If a submitter sends a question without signing in and their topic is “Getting care at a local VA medical center” their question doesn’t go to the PATSR CRM
- Health facility doesn’t determine routing for submitters who don’t sign in. It’s asked just in case an agent needs the information (opportunity to remove this field for non-signed in submitters?)
- If a submitter sends a question after signing in and their topic is “Getting care at a local VA medical center” their question goes to the PATSR CRM
- In the Ask VA CRM **Inquiry Assigned Queue** will equal **AVA Default Routing Assignments**
- Facilities rarely get added to the PATSR CRM (~1 every year)
- We only display PATSR facilities in the Ask VA form after submitters search a key word.
