## Statuses and when they are displayed

For Phase 1 on VA.gov, we'll display these statuses and descriptions. We revised the [legacy descriptions](#legacy-statuses-for-reference) using the [VA.gov content style guide](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/plain-language/use-active-voice). Due to the complexity of updating the status names without revisiting the trigger events, our VEO partners and our team agreed to keep the statuses as is for Phase 1.

|Status|Descriptive text|Trigger event|
|:--|:--|:--|
|`New`|We received your question. Weâ€™ll review it soon.|The system automatically sets the status to `New` when a question is submitted.|
|`In progress`|We're reviewing your question.|The system automatically sets the status to `In progress` when an agent is assigned. Even if the inquiry is re-routed, it will stay `In progress` until it moves to `Solved`.|
|`Solved`|We either answered your question or didn't have enough information to answer your question. If you need more help, ask a new question.|An agent manually changes the status to `Solved` when an inquiry: has been resolved, is a duplicate, or has insufficient details. `Solved` can also mean an agent has replied asking for more information, so the conversation may not be over.|
|`Reopened`|We received your reply. We'll respond soon.|The system automatically sets the status to `Reopened` when a submitter replies to a `Solved` inquiry.|
|`Closed`|This isn't shown to submitters.|The system automatically updates the status of `Solved` inquiries to `Closed` after 60 days of no activity. This only applies to business inquiries, and happens so they will be removed from their dashboard.|
|`Question not found`|We didn't find any questions with reference number "A-20230710-306466." Check your reference number and try again.<br><br>If it still doesn't work, ask the same question again and include your original reference number.|A submitter searches for an reference number that is not found in the system.|

## Future work

- Review statuses and their descriptions with Veterans and other submitters.
- Develop a different workflow for how things are `Solved` that allows for more granular states and is more clear for the submitter.
- Consider a feature that allows the _submitter_ to indicate when their question has been solved, instead of the agent.

## Legacy statuses for reference

This is the text that is currently displayed on ask.va.gov. This descriptive text will be retired when we move to VA.gov, but the triggers and statuses will remain the same.
