# Recommendation to remove pronouns from Ask VA
Last updated by @beckyphung: May 30, 2024

## Update on May 30, 2024
We will continue to ask for pronouns in the form, but only for the submitter. This is because pronouns are self identifying. The submitter cannot provide someone else's pronouns.

We met with John Williams and Nancy Clarkson to confirm when we the Ask VA form should ask for pronouns. See complete meeting notes [in this GitHub doc](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/meeting-notes/pronoun-collection/pronoun-collection-meeting-May-30.md). 

John Williams is the business lead for the Enterprise Demographics Implementation and Integration (EDII) effort from the Multi-Channel Technology (MCT) team in the Veterans Experience Office (VEO). Nancy Clarkson is the technical lead for EDII from the Architecture and Engineering Services (AES) team also in VEO.

## Update on April 3, 2024

As of April 3, 2024, **we have decided we will keep pronouns in the form**. They will be optional. We will only ask for the pronouns of the subject of the inquiry if they are not the submitter. We will not ask for the submitter's pronouns.

We will add help text to the pronouns field, so Veterans understand why we're collecting this information.

In the future, we might revisit this field. Pronouns are technically in MPI. We aren't pulling this data right now and we could consider doing so in the future.

The rest of this document is here for archival purposes.

## Current pronouns use
Ask VA is one of the only online VA forms we could find that currently asks for pronouns. Here’s how it looks in the current form at ask.va.gov:

We tested the updated component in January 2024 with Veterans within the larger Ask VA form flow:

We also know that the profile on VA.gov will tentatively include pronouns in the future. The exact timing of this is still to be planned.

## Insights from January 2024 usability testing

During usability testing with Veterans in January, we learned that Veterans may have a stronger,  more negative reaction to pronouns as compared to gender. They especially took issue with them being required.
> "I'm not gonna get into the pronouns thing. That's not for me."

> "And for God's sake, get rid of the pronouns. Actually, yeah, that right there would turn me on just about everything. My pronouns wouldn't matter even if I felt it mattered. It's condescending. It's ridiculous."

> “And I even don't know what they mean [by preferred name]. You have my name, your name is your name, it's whatever you enter here, first name, last name, that's your name.

We also learned that Veterans can be hesitant to provide their pronouns in Ask VA, because they don’t know where the information is going.
> "Maybe pronouns, but I don't think I'd even include that either, because there again, I don't know where this information is going."

And most Veterans choose “Use my preferred name,” which allows them to opt out of providing pronouns, but still answer the required question.

> “This is asking how you want to be addressed. And I put my preferred name.”

> “Probably just use my preferred name, not to answer. Yeah.”

## Proposal to remove pronouns
The purpose of pronouns is to understand how to address someone or refer to someone in the third-person respectfully, in the way they want to be addressed or referred to. We recognize that for people who do want to provide pronouns, asking for pronouns up-front in the form is more inclusive.

However, we recommend removing the pronouns questions because: 

- We shouldn't collect data we don't use. It’s unclear how often agents refer to pronouns data to address a submitter or refer to a person.
- Submitters are frustrated that they have to provide information that seems irrelevant to asking VA a question.
- People might not want VA to know their pronouns because they don’t know how VA will use that information.
- Asking one less question makes the form shorter and faster to complete. There are already an unprecedented number of fields in this contact form compared to other VA contact forms.
   - The current Ask VA form can have at most 42 fields (17 optional), while the [contact form on My HealtheVet](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/contact-us) can have at most 13 fields (4 optional).

## An alternative to collecting pronouns data
There are other ways, besides pronouns, to meet the goal of addressing or referring to a person respectfully. Instead of asking for pronouns and asking submitters to submit one more piece of information about themselves, we could provide guidance for Ask VA agents, including:

- Always use someone’s preferred name unless a submitter indicate otherwise
- Always use gender neutral terms, such as “they,” unless a submitter indicates otherwise
