# Removing pronouns from Ask VA

Last updated by @tygindraux: April 28, 2025

## Current status as of February 2025

We have removed pronouns from Ask VA as of February 2025. This was in response to an [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/).

## Past updates

### May 2024

We met with John Williams and Nancy Clarkson to confirm when we should ask for pronouns in Ask VA. [Review meeting notes](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/meeting-notes/pronoun-collection/pronoun-collection-meeting-May-30.md). John Williams is the business lead for the Enterprise Demographics Implementation and Integration (EDII) effort from the Multi-Channel Technology (MCT) team in the Veterans Experience Office (VEO). Nancy Clarkson is the technical lead for EDII from the Architecture and Engineering Services (AES) team also in VEO.

We will continue to ask for pronouns in the form, but only for the submitter. Because pronouns are self identifying, the submitter cannot provide someone else's pronouns.

### April 2024

As of April 3, 2024, we decided we will keep pronouns in the form. They will be optional. We will only ask for the pronouns of the subject of the inquiry if they are not the submitter. We will not ask for the submitter's pronouns. We will add help text to the pronouns field, so Veterans understand why we're collecting this information.

In the future, we might revisit this field. Pronouns are technically in MPI. We aren't pulling this data right now and we could consider doing so in the future.

### January 2024

During usability testing with Veterans in January, we learned that Veterans may have a stronger,  more negative reaction to pronouns as compared to gender. They especially took issue with them being required.

> "I'm not gonna get into the pronouns thing. That's not for me."

> "And for God's sake, get rid of the pronouns. Actually, yeah, that right there would turn me on just about everything. My pronouns wouldn't matter even if I felt it mattered. It's condescending. It's ridiculous."

> “And I even don't know what they mean [by preferred name]. You have my name, your name is your name, it's whatever you enter here, first name, last name, that's your name.

We also learned that Veterans can be hesitant to provide their pronouns in Ask VA, because they don’t know where the information is going.

> "Maybe pronouns, but I don't think I'd even include that either, because there again, I don't know where this information is going."

And most Veterans choose “Use my preferred name,” which allows them to opt out of providing pronouns, but still answer the required question.

> “This is asking how you want to be addressed. And I put my preferred name.”

> “Probably just use my preferred name, not to answer. Yeah.”

### 2023

Ask VA is one of the only online VA forms we could find that currently asks for pronouns.

The purpose of pronouns is to understand how to address someone or refer to someone in the third-person respectfully, in the way they want to be addressed or referred to. We recognize that for people who do want to provide pronouns, asking for pronouns up-front in the form is more inclusive.

However, we recommend removing the pronouns questions because: 

- We shouldn't collect data we don't use. It’s unclear how often agents refer to pronouns data to address a submitter or refer to a person.
- Submitters are frustrated that they have to provide information that seems irrelevant to asking VA a question.
- People might not want VA to know their pronouns because they don’t know how VA will use that information.
- Asking one less question makes the form shorter and faster to complete. There are already an unprecedented number of fields in this contact form compared to other VA contact forms.
  - The current Ask VA form can have at most 42 fields (17 optional), while the [contact form on My HealtheVet](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/contact-us) can have at most 13 fields (4 optional).

Instead of asking for pronouns agents can use someone's name or preferred name.
