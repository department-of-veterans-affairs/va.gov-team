# List of category, topic and subtopic labels

Last updated by @tygindraux: April 25, 2024

**Note:** In Ask VA, we pull category, topic and subtopic lists from CRM so labels automatically update if any changes are made. Please note that this list in Github can become out-of-date periodically.

## List order

Categories are listed in order of rank field, meaning sequential order from most to least used.

Topics and subtopics are listed alphabetically, except `Other` which is last in the list when present.
