## Business vs. Personal
This doc explains when inquiries are categorized as Business or Personal. AKA when the Level of Authentication field = Business or Personal.

## Rules
### For questions for the “Education benefits and work study” category
- These are all going to be “general questions” 
- For What is your relationship to the Veteran?, select: 
   - I'm connected to the Veteran through my work (for example, as a School Certifying Official or fiduciary)

### For all other questions 
- For Who is your question about?
  - Select Someone else
  - Do not select “It’s a general question” for non-Education questions. Because then, the relationship question will not appear.
- For What is your relationship to the Veteran?, select: 
  - I'm connected to the Veteran through my work (for example, as a School Certifying Official or fiduciary)
