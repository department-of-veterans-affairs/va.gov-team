#### Response from VA
Hello, 
<br>
<br> You have reached CHAMPVA. Our program is exclusively for family members of service members/Veterans who are determined permanent and total, service-connected disabled, or whose raiting show they are being paid at 100% due to unemployability, or who died service connected, who are not otherwise eligible for Tricare. We do not provide care/coverage for Veterans.
<br> 
<br> Please reach out to the patient advocate at your local VAMC for assistance.
<br> 
<br> To apply you must go to www.va.gov/vaforms and download VA form 10-10d & 10-7959c, complete and submit to the address or fax provided on VA form 10-10d.
<br> 
<br> For further questions you may call CHAMPVA at 1-800-733-8387.
