# Content guidance for Ask VA
Last updated by @beckyphung on August 1, 2025

This page describes content for Ask VA [in our draft designs in Figma](https://www.figma.com/files/project/174974739/Ask-VA?fuid=1248985325385082769) and also in current VA.gov pages.

## Terms
- **Ask VA**: There's a space between "Ask" and "VA"
- **contact us online, message us, ask us a question online**: These are different ways that VA.gov frames how to use Ask VA on various pages, including every hub page. VA.gov uses "Contact us online" the most.
   - **verify enrollment, upload document**: Some education pages direct users to use Ask VA for these more specific tasks.  
- **question**: This describes the initial message that submitters send through Ask VA. Internally, we refer to these records as "inquiries." We try to use "question" externally because it's easier to understand. 
- **answer, response, or reply**: This describes the message that VA sends back to the submitter after reviewing their question.
   - **answer**: This could also refer to the submitter's field inputs. This is currently referenced on the summary page.  
- **submit, send**: This verb describes how submitters send their initial message.
- **respond, communicate**: This verb describes how VA sends back a message to the submitter.
- **inbox**: This describes the dashboard where submitters can view previous submissions and reply to current submissions.
- **reference number**: This describes the unique identifier that is created and connected to a submitter's original question.
- **status**: This describes whether a submitter's questions has been answered by VA or not. [These are the different statuses](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/design/Statuses%20and%20triggers.md) a question can have.

## Areas for improvement
- Align content in the Ask VA experience with content currently in VA.gov (or vice versa?)
   - Example: The "Contact us" page directs users to "ask our chatbot a question." But we direct users to also "get answers" and "ask a question online" on our landing page ([link to staging](https://staging.va.gov/contact-us/ask-va/)). When should we direct users to use Ask VA vs. other tools or customer support channels?
- If there are multiple terms describing one thing, consider choosing only one term to lead with

## Internal VA terms
These are internal terms VA teams may use with Ask VA.
- **AVA**: This is an acronym for "Ask VA"
- **submitter**: This describes a person who submits a question through Ask VA
- **inquiry**: This describes the initial message a submitter sends through Ask VA and also the entire message "thread" between the submitter and VA
- **agent, user**: This describes the person who answers questions from submitters in the CRM
- **business line**: This describes a VA team who usually has multiple agents who answer questions in the CRM. A business line may have multiple queues or just one queue.
- **queue**: This describes a group within a business line that only answers certain questions in the CRM. Agents are assigned to certain queues to only answer certain questions.
- **routing**: This describes the logic that the CRM executes to determine which queue questions fall under. Routing is largely determined by the category and topic submitters choose. It can also be determined by other variables, like medicial facility.
- **rerouting**: This describes how agents may need to forward a submitter's questions to another queue for someone else to answer. This could happen because the submitter submits a question to a queue that the agent can't answer.
