# Contact options by business line

Last updated by @beckyphung: March 19, 2024

**Update**: We've recommended that US mail be removed. We have confirmed with business lines whether they'd like to keep US mail or agree with our recommendation to remove it as an option for their queue.

- [Reason for keeping US mail](#reason-for-keeping-US-mail)

## How this pattern works

If a business line supports 2 or more contact options, the form includes a question that asks for a submitter's contact preference. If a business line only supports 1 contact option (email), the form omits this question. This is determined based on category and topic.

The confirmation page lets a submitter know how they will be contacted, whether it's by phone, email or U.S. mail.

## When to enable or disable contact options

### Reason for keeping US mail
In March 2024, we documented some reasons why the following business lines wanted to keep the US mail option for their category and/or topic.

#### Decision reviews and appeals
From a sample of data from November 2023 to January 2024, we found that only 2% of inquiries preferred to be contacted by US mail. Of those 2% of inquiries that prefer to be contacted by US mail, 86% of inquiries that refer US mail are submitted under the “Appeals of Denied Claims” category. And of those 86% of inquiries, 96% are submitted under the “Higher-Level Review” topic.

The business line stakeholder explained that sending a response via US mail "allows another avenue to resolve the inquiry and respond." If the submitter selects US mail, the agents curently "add a note to the resolution/resolved portion that states a letter was requested and sent to the Veteran."

#### Pension and Guardianship, custodianship, or fiduciary issues
Leadership from the Pension & Fiduciary (P&F) team considered the population of claimants they served. The population includes older Veterans, widows/widowers, other vulnerable poulations, etc. They wanted to keep the US mail option in particular for these claimants. 

#### Categories and topics answered by the VBA-All Response Team (ART)  
This reasoning applies to all categories and topics answered by the VBA-All Response Team (ART) queue. This queue is also known as the National Call Center (NCC) Agents for All Response Team (ART) queue.

These are categories and topics this queue handles: 
- Benefits issues outside the U.S. (Topic: Disability compensation)
- Disability compensation
- Debt for benefit overpayments and health care copay bills (Topic: Separation pay overpayments)
- Debt for benefit overpayments and health care copay bills (Topic: Severance pay overpayments)
- Survivor Benefits
- Burials and memorials (Topic: Burial allowance)

The business line stakeholder provided the following reason for keeping US mail:
> We need to be uniform in response options offered across our business line. To allow return phone calls/emails/letters during 7 million+ annual contacts in the National Contact Centers,  285k+ with our Public Contact Teams, then restrict reply options in 100k inquiries simply because of the mechanism used to ask a question is neither consistent nor customer-centric.

### Debt for benefit overpayments and health care copay bills
The business line stakeholder provided the following reason for keeping US mail:
> We are required by 38USC to keep physical mail as our primary notification so therefore we need to keep it.
