# 1. General rules

**Most categories and topics do not require a location of residence or a postal code, unless someone chooses to be contacted by mail.**

However, there are a few scenarios where we collect location of residence and/or postal code for routing or other informational purposes. These are:
- `IF CATEGORY =` Guardianship, custodianship or fiduciary issues `AND TOPIC ≠` Other
- `IF CATEGORY =` Veteran Readiness and Employment `AND TOPIC ≠` Other
- `IF CATEGORY` = Education benefits and work study `AND TOPIC =` Veteran Readiness and Employment
- `IF CATEGORY` = Health care

(These categories and topics have different rules, described below in detail.)

In general, when we require a location of residence and/or a postal code for the **submitter**, we **first** check which contact preference they choose. If their contact preference is phone or email, then we carry on asking for their location of residence and/or postal code. **But**, if their contact preference is U.S. mail, then we skip collecting their location of residence and/or postal code separately. They're collected on the mailing address page instead.

| A general question  | VA medical center is not required | **require submitter’s postal code** |

### Why do we require this information?

We require postal code because these VHA offices are national but they may need to direct someone to a local medical facility or share local resources.

We don't require postal code when we collect VA medical center in order to reduce submitter burden. Also, medical facility is more specific and if it's still necessary, an agent can get their postal code through MPI.
