Ask VA VA.gov Team

Last updated by @tygindraux: February 12, 2025

## Purpose

### Research goals

- Review how other websites provide help before asking someone to submit an inquiry
- Review how many fields are included on other websites' contact forms
- Review how other websites ask for information that lets them categorize or route an inquiry
- Review how being signed in (or not) changes the experience of contacting another organization online

### Outcome

This will help us articulate the things we like or don’t like and which direction to go with Ask VA. It will feed into product vision exercises we plan to do with partners.

### Methdology

1. Identify websites to compare.
2. Review the contact experience on the website.
3. Compare to Ask VA.
