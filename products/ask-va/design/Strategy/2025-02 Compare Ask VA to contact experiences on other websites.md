Ask VA VA.gov Team

Last updated by @tygindraux: February 12, 2025

## Purpose

### Research goals

- Review how other websites provide help before asking someone to submit an inquiry
- Review how many fields are included on other websites' contact forms
- Review how other websites ask for information that lets them categorize or route an inquiry
- Review how being signed in (or not) changes the experience of contacting another organization online

### Outcome

This will help us articulate the things we like or donâ€™t like and which direction to go with Ask VA. It will feed into product vision exercises we plan to do with partners.

### Methdology

1. Identify websites to compare.
2. Review the contact experience on the website.
3. Compare to Ask VA.
