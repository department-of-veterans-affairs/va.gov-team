# Follow-up email to send after a question is closed

Ask VA VA.gov Team

Last updated by @tygindraux: February 3, 2025

## About this document

We will send a follow-up email to every submitter after a question is marked as ‘Solved’ (or ‘Replied’) by an agent. This will allow us to capture inquiry specific feedback after the last step in a user’s journey. 

We can use this feedback to learn whether replies from VA are helping submitters complete the tasks they set out to do.

There is more information about this initiative in [Phase 2: Initiatives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/product/Phase%202%3A%20Initiatives.md).

## Email content

Note: This content has not been reviewed by the VA.gov content team yet.

> Dear [Submitter First Name],

> Thank you for contacting the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.

> Did our reply answer your question?
>
> [Yes or no]
>
> Your feedback will help us improve. Thank you.

Note: We're still clarifying how we will implement this. We may include a link to a survey. Overall, we want to ask a yes or no question about whether their question was answered.

## Implementation approach

Note: This will be completed by product with support from engineering and the CRM team. Here are previous conversations that are relevant:
