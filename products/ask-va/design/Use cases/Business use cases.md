## Methodology
Our goal was to understand how and why business submitters use Ask VA. These are the steps we took to review inquiries: 
- Review submitted inquiries in the CRM PROD agent UI
- Enable filters:
   - Level of Authentication = Business
   - Inquiry Created On is in December 2025
   - Filter by all categories and topics
- Note down patterns and screenshots with PII/PHI redacted [in Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1765466554145/0fd0d26bdafaa7423966a416fee9b2d0a09274db)
