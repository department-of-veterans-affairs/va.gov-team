# Similarities and differences between categories

Last updated by @tygindraux: October 25, 2023

This document summarizes patterns in the design of the Ask VA form by calling out similarities and differences between categories. It's intended to be helpful for our engineers as they start building.

## Key categories to reference

There are a certain categories which can be used as a reference when building categories the same or similar to it. There are also a few categories which standout from the others.

Note: If we say that a category is the "same" as another, an exception to their sameness will always be the names of the category, topic and subtopics (review [label names](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/design/Category%2C%20topic%20and%20subtopic%20labels.md)).

### Life insurance aka The Vanilla Flow 🍦

The `Life insurance` category is a good example of what we've referred to as "a vanilla flow." It's straightforward, with few conditionals, and many other categories mimic (or build on) it. Also, all [contact options](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/design/List%20of%20contact%20options.md) are enabled consistently.

**The Vanilla Flow** forks into four sections, based on whether a submitter is asking:
- a general question
- about me, the Veteran
- for the dependent of a Veteran
- on behalf of a Veteran

### Health care aka All-Day Lasagna 🍝

The `Health care` category builds on the **The Vanilla Flow**. At first glance, it looks simple (like a lasagna should be) but it's much more complex because:
- it includes [Search Facility: VA Medical Center]
- it's [contact options](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/design/List%20of%20contact%20options.md) vary greatly depending on the topic
- sometimes it includes the Veteran's [Zip code], even if the submitter isn't being contacted by US Mail

Because this category is more complex, aka **[All-Day Lasagna](https://www.seriouseats.com/no-holds-barred-lasagna-bolognese-pasta-italian-homemade-ricotta)**, we've chosen to test this flow with users (submitters). While this category **does not** require authentication, for testing we will include this as a requirement so we can test the most risky path.

**Review this category here:**

### Education benefits and work study aka Salad for Breakfast? 🥗

The `Education benefits and work study` category requires authentication. It also forks depending on:
- if `Topic` = `Veteran Readiness and Employment`
- if `Topic` ≠ `Veteran Readiness and Employment` 

#### If Topic = Veteran Readiness and Employment
It will follow the same pattern as `Category` = `Veteran Readiness and Employment` ([see above](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/design/Similarities%20and%20differences%20between%20categories.md#life-insurance-aka-the-vanilla-flow-)). But, because it sits within the `Education benefits and work study` category in this case, it does require authentication.

#### If Topic ≠ Veteran Readiness and Employment
For all other `Topics` in `Education benefits and work study` it follows a unique structure, aka **[Salad for Breakfast?](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=576631001&q=Is+it+OK+to+have+salad+for+breakfast%3F&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjhj9qjoZKCAxXfI0QIHUSdCsIQzmd6BAgZEAY&biw=1803&bih=851&dpr=1)**:
- it does not fork into the same four sections as **The Vanilla Flow**
- it asks the submitter's relationship to the Veteran in order to determine whether it's a **business or personal relationship**
- it includes [Select: State of school]
- if it's a personal relationship, it includes [Select: State of residency]
- if it's a business relationship, it includes [Search Facility: VA Medical Center]
- there is always only one contact section (the submitter)
- it only asks for [Social security number or service number](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/design/Field%20rules.md#social-security-number-or-service-number) and [Date of birth](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/design/Field%20rules.md#date-of-birth) if it's a personal inquiry
- email is the only [contact option](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/design/List%20of%20contact%20options.md)
