- [Future work](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/design/Statuses.md#future-work)
- [Legacy statuses for reference](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/design/Statuses.md#legacy-statuses-for-reference)

## Statuses and when they are displayed

We'll display these statuses and descriptive text in Ask VA when it moves to VA.gov. We've revised the [legacy statuses](#legacy-statuses-for-reference) using the [VA.gov content style guide](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/plain-language/use-active-voice). On December 6, 2023, Laura from CAIA reviewed the statuses to ensure they align with other statuses on VA.gov.

The triggers will remain the same, but they might be revisited in the [future]((https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/design/Statuses.md#future-work)).

## Future work

- Review statuses and their descriptions with Veterans and other submitters.
- Test a feature that allows the _submitter_ to indicate when their question has been solved, instead of the agent.

## Legacy statuses for reference

This is the text that is currently displayed on ask.va.gov. This descriptive text will be retired when we move to VA.gov, but the triggers and statuses will remain the same.
