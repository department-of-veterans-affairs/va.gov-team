# List of contact options

Last updated by @beckyphung: March 6, 2024 

March 2024 Update: We're reconfirming if business lines agree to removing US mail as an option. We've started tracking responses below.

December 2023 Update: This list has been discussed and agreed upon by all business lines ([review list of stakeholders](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/research/Business%20line%20engagement/List%20of%20stakeholders%20by%20category.md)).

## How this pattern works

When a submitter can choose between ≥ 2 contact options, we need to include a question that captures their contact preference. Here's an example from [Ask VA - Sketch - Health care](https://sketch.com/s/6a75d0a2-e484-4f1e-8675-ad5747a1a871). You can also reference this [pattern in the VA.gov design system](https://design.va.gov/patterns/ask-users-for/contact-preferences).

![image](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/research/Notes/Images/Contact-preference.png)

When a submitter cannot choose between ≥ 2 contact options, for example, only email is `ENABLED`, this question is omitted from the form.

In all cases, the submission page should let a submitter know how they can expect to be contacted. Here's an example from [Ask VA - Sketch - Education](https://sketch.com/s/7e494761-be10-4aef-a268-a45a02fbc5c3).
