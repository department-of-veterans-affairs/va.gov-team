## Research goals

The key goal of this study is to:

* Identify any barriers that could prevent Veterans who use assistive technology from reviewing past questions, reading a reply from VA or replying to VA through Ask VA

## Research questions

* Are any headers, labels or links lacking description or clarity?
* Can Veterans interact with all elements using only their keyboards?
* Are click targets, hover states and labels of controls always available and clear?
* Are Veterans still oriented and able to use the dashboard when magnified?
* Are there any inconsistencies during the journey that present confusion?
* Do Veterans who use assistive technology feel they can read a reply from VA or reply to VA without the support of another person?
* Does Ask VA need to change or evolve to offer an equitable experience? If so, how?
* Are statuses clear, do they require more description? If so, just for screen reader users or for everyone?
* Do accordions adding unnecessary complexity? Would plain text be better for the conversation?

## Methodology 

We ran a moderated usability study remotely on Zoom. We mocked the sign in process, so participants didn't have to sign in but we did test the authenticated experience.

## Hypotheses and conclusions

|Hypothesis|Conclusion|Explanation|
|:--|:--|:--|
|Veterans will think headers, labels and links are descriptive and clear.|Mostly True|Most headers, labels and links were descriptive and clear. But, there was confusion understanding which elements sit within a card, what 'Reopened' means, and the conversation accordions could be labelled more clearly.|
|Veterans will be able to interact with all elements using only their keyboards or other devices.|True|Veterans were able to interact with all elements using their assistive technology, apart from one Veteran who navigated visually and expected their mouse to activate VoiceOver upon hover, which did not work.|
|Veterans will be oriented and still able to use the dashboard when magnified.|True|There was very little difference noted with magnification.|
|Veteran's who use screen readers will find it difficult to know how many cards are under the "Your question" section, including when they filter by category and/or status.|True|Veterans did not understand which elements sit within a card, which made it difficult to know how many cards were present when using a screen reader. Whether with filters or not.|
|Veterans will not have difficulty navigating between pages of cards on the dashboard with their assistive technology.|True|There wasn't difficulty with navigating, it was more related to not knowing when a card ends and a new one begins.|
|Veterans will find it difficult to understand what each status means without more description, regardless of which assistive technology they use.|Mostly False|Most statuses were very clear, apart from 'Reopened' which Veterans associate with claims not conversations.|

## Key findings

1. It's difficult for screen reader users to tell when one card ends and another begins.
2. Sorting by date is less useful than filtering by status or category.
3. It's clear who sent each part of the conversation, but it would be easier to skim if the bold text was the sender.
4. People understand what each status means, apart from Reopened which is confusing when it's not related to claims.
5. How to navigate to the next page of cards is clear for people using different assistive technology.
6. 7 business days is too long for most people to wait, especially knowing there are more timely ways to get information.

## Details of findings 

### Finding 1: It's difficult for screen reader users to tell when one card ends and another begins.

_Labels: `PRDT: AVA`, `AUD: Veterans`_

The overall purpose of Ask VA and the dashboard was clear. However, screen reader users had trouble figuring out which elements belong to each question.

Often, people thought the 'replied' label was a heading and the reply from VA would follow. This made it difficult for screen reader users to understand where to find the reply from VA and what they could click on.

And it was difficult to find the 'Check details' links when skimming with screen reader. This could be because it takes a while to hear the word link and because the link is not an accurate description of the action. In contrast, sighted people find and understand this link easily.

> "I've seen two replies, but I was like okay, what questions were those for. So that's why I had to scroll back to the top."

> "I was thinking that I was going to read the reply [next]. [But] the next thing is actually, after the reply, it's something different. It's speaking about dependents, I take it. [...] It's a question that's been asked, not a reply about how to get my wife an ID card."

> "Could you put check details... It seems like that needs to be worded so you know that's also where you can go to read the reply. The wording. Check details... and replies? Something that makes it more [obvious]."

### Finding 2: Sorting by date is less useful than filtering by status or category.

_Labels: `PRDT: AVA`, `AUD: Veterans`_

Most Veterans, most of the time will keep the default of sorting by newest to oldest.

Filters are used more frequently and easily by people who are navigating visually.

Filter by status was most commonly useful because people want to know when they have a reply. Veterans will use filter by category if they remember what their question is related to.

If 'search' was a feature, people would expect to be able to search multiple fields, such as, question, dates and category.

> "Instead of giving me a filter, its giving me, 'select all of them.' I don't know how to select something different [than all]."

> "I know once I figured it out I would be using the filter by status."

> "Filter by status would let you know what's been replied to and what's still in progress."

> "There's at least 2 pages, so if there was more, it would be easier to just click on the filter and go down to that [housing] subject."

### Finding 3: It's clear who sent each part of the conversation, but it would be easier to skim if the bold text was the sender.

_Labels: `PRDT: AVA`, `AUD: Veterans`_

It's intuitive to read a chronological conversation. Veterans focused more on who sent each message compared to the date and time it was sent.

The accordions made it easy to skim the page. But, because one accordion was defaulted open, people often accidentally closed it as they went down the list opening them.

There needs to be separation  between the last accordion and send a reply, otherwise people miss the content.

> "I had to click on the question to open the question and then I had to click on the response and open the response. It was categorized very well. I liked the hide boxes because it made it that much easier to read. I asked the question, they answered the question. You don't have to go down the whole page. [...] It made it a lot easier to read."

> "It's clearly labelled, your question, response, your reply."

> "You want me to open it? [Although the last accordion was already opened, they thought it was closed like the previous two.]"

### Finding 4: People understand what each status means, apart from 'Reopened' which is confusing when it's not related to claims.

_Labels: `PRDT: AVA`, `AUD: Veterans`_

‘In progress’ clearly means that the VA is working on a reply.

‘Replied’ is much more clear than ‘Closed,’ which we tested previously. It means the VA has sent you a reply.

But ‘Reopened’ is less clear now that the statuses more clearly represent a conversation, not a case. 

Some people felt it would be more clear if it toggled between ‘In progress’ and ‘Replied.’

> "Replied is pretty self explanatory, you've probably gotten an answer to your question."

> "I'm not sure what reopened means, because my understanding is you only get information, it's not like you're filing something with the government. I'm not sure, if they actually give you claims through this."

> "'Reopened.' A lot of Veterans would go, 'Oh my god, reopened. They're reopening my claims or case?' [...] I would change that."

> "I'm not really sure what 'reopened' means [...] Maybe if I was happy and then a week, or a couple weeks later, I thought, 'Oh, I need to ask this question.' And you can and then it'd be 'reopened.'"

### Finding 5: How to navigate to the next page of cards is clear for people using different assistive technology.

_Labels: `PRDT: AVA`, `AUD: Veterans`_

People using screen readers, magnification, voice control or other technology, could navigate to the next page of questions.

Apart from a bug that anchors you to the footer when you navigate to page 2.

Some people may prefer to have more than 4 cards per page, but the need for this is less clear right now.

> "It says current page, so we're [on Page 1] and there's another page. [Next, they navigated to page 2]."

> "It said, page 1 and page 2, so I clicked on page 2 and it put me all the way at the bottom of page 2. So I had to swipe up. So that was probably the weirdest thing that ever happened to me [when] going to another page."

> "I like [when] I [can] display a hundred messages per page, and scroll down as opposed to [here], you seem to choose just 4 messages per page."

### Finding 6: 7 business days is too long for most people to wait, especially knowing there are more timely ways to get information.

_Labels: `PRDT: AVA`, `AUD: Veterans`_

Veterans consistently lament the 7 day turnaround time.

Many people would decide to call the VA instead, after realizing it takes 7 business days to receive a reply.

And struggle to think of scenarios where they would use Ask VA instead of another contact method.

Veterans mention preferring AI if it means they'll receive a faster answer, or at first, assuming that Ask VA will "be" AI.

> "If they had more manageable timeframes, it wouldn't be that bad to use."

> "If I made a phone call and talked to a human being, I could get that answer in the same day. It depends on how patient you are, some of these older Veterans might be more patient. For me, I'm just asking a simple question, I don't know if I'm going to want to wait a week..."

> "I don't mind using AI, being visually impaired, I'm all for AI because it makes my life easier. It can send you to a document right off. If you're talking to a person, sometimes they don't know things as well, it takes a while for them, they've got to go look at their computer, go research something [...] then they finally come back."

> "I hope it starts out with AI so I can just go, 'hey, I need form 10-something. [...] And if you're working with AI, usually if you get to something like [entering personal information or uploading files] then it will connect you to a live agent."

## Additional insights

- Skimming cards by submission date is simple for sighted users.
- There's an issue with content continuing after the ellipsis in the cards.
- Magnification users felt they would rely on magnification most to read the 'collapse all' or 'expand all' button and the reference number.
- Many people misunderstand the reply from VA or aren't satisfied by it.
- It's straightforward for people to send a reply back to VA using different assistive technology.
- People need reassurance that Ask VA is secure before sharing personal information and/or files online.
- It should be clear if Ask VA is not the best tool or contact method to use.
- Veterans prefer to get in touch with a specific department or person directly, rather than a catch all.
- One person, who navigates visually with a screen reader, expected VoiceOver to work with their cursor but it did not.

## Recommendations

1. Make it easier for screen reader users to navigate cards, by:
  - Grouping the dashboard cards in an LI element will make it easier to distinguish between questions.
  - Changing the 'Check details' link to 'Review conversation' and announce a shorter link, "Review conversation for question submitted on August 24."
  - Add sr-only class to tags that says, 'status' for consistency and clarity.
2. Make it simpler to filter, by:
  - Removing sorting menu and default to always newest to oldest.
  - Add description of how many cards are on the dashboard, which changes when filtering.
  - Move filter by status to first, and filter by category next.
3. Make the conversation easy to read, by:
  - Changing first, bold text on accordions to sender and second, unbolded text to date and time.
  - Defaulting all accordions closed in conversation.
  - Adding accordion border and consider adding more spacing to message within according.
4. Ensure statuses are clear, by:
  - Reconsidering what we name the 'reopened' status or, consider that reopened just sends a question back to in progress until there's another reply.
5. Fix a few outstanding bugs, by:
  - Making it so content does not continue after the ellipsis in the cards.
  - Removing anchor to the footer that happens when you click to next page.

Other ideas we considered:
- Changing the background color of the cards to help visually break up the cards or to show when there's a reply.
- Removing 'last updated' until something happens to make it clearer when something has a new update.
- Adding a search feature, which we've discussed in the past and is out of scope for now.
- Updating the 'Contact us' page, so it's more clear what Ask VA can and can't help with.

## Further research needed

We recommend further testing once we're live in production. In particular, in the next phase of work, we'd like to explore:
- Search feature
- How to better sync up statuses so agents are referencing the same statuses as submitters
- Ability for submitters to say when a question has been 'answered' and can be 'closed'

## Underserved groups we haven’t talked to 

We have completed the [VA Recruitment Checker for Equality]([https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?gid=1967698004#gid=1967698004](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?gid=294039656#gid=294039656)).

This study focused on AT, as do these notes. We had 4 sessions cancelled for various reasons and 2 no-shows. We scheduled 3 additional sessions. This was partly due to lack of clarity about who is included in each cohort on Perigean's part. In the end, we exceeded our target of 6 and finished with 9 complete sessions. More importantly, we hit our cohort quotas, with:
- Screen reader users: 5 of 3* complete sessions
- Alternative navigation users: 3 of 2** complete sessions
- Magnification users: 1 of 1 complete session

*1 person navigated visually with their mouse
**2 people only use Dragon for dictation not for navigation
