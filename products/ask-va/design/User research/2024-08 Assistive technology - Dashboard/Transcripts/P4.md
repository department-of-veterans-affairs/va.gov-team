### Warm up

Tyler: Okay. So the recording has started. And I just want to confirm, if you're comfortable, that I quote, that I record my screen and audio today.

3
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.490
> P4: Confirmed.

4
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.130
Tyler: Okay.

5
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.260
Tyler: awesome. Do you have any questions for me? At this point.

6
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:17.310
> P4: I don't.

7
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:28.599
Tyler: Okay, well, before we get into to looking at the website together, I would love to just learn a little bit more about you and your experience with the Va. How long have you been a veteran.

8
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.899
> P4: I transitioned out [around] 2016. So, coming up on 8 years.

9
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.760
Tyler: Okay.

10
00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.949
Tyler: cool. And did you start interacting with the Va when you were kind of getting out of service.

11
00:00:41.278 --> 00:00:58.679
> P4: Yes, it was pretty seamless, because I moved from one post to [location], and that's where the closest Va. Is for me. So it was a pretty, pretty, seamless, other than just the initial, like entry into the Va. System, which is just typical government bureaucracy, which is slow and painful, but.

12
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.300
Tyler: Totally to be yeah.

13
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.199
Tyler: And these days, how are you interacting with the Va kind of regularly.

14
00:01:05.669 --> 00:01:10.429
> P4: I mean, I would. Do, you know, other than if I've got like a specific issue of.

15
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.759
Tyler: Was it.

16
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:37.990
> P4: Many but you know, just like staying in touch with the Pcp. Like the nice thing that I found out like maybe a month ago was because the Va. In [location] is literally right. Next to another health organization that, like my Pcp. Is at, and they exchange information so like. I now don't need to go to both. I can just go to one, and then they share all the information. So that makes things tremendously easier. Because going downtown to [location] is just terrible now with traffic.

17
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.670
Tyler: Right, I'm sorry.

18
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.690
> P4: So that's highly beneficial.

19
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.866
Tyler: Awesome. And when you're getting in touch with the Va, it sounds like it's mostly for like medical healthcare.

20
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.600
> P4: Yes.

21
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.249
Tyler: How are you chatting to your primary care team?

22
00:01:51.250 --> 00:02:20.569
> P4: Most of the time I use the I can't remember what the messaging is on the my healthy vet I think it's what it's called that's super convenient. I would say the response, times are typically really good anytime I reach out to somebody. It's like within a day, and then, if they do have questions, what they'll just call me so no, no issues there. It's pretty good. I'd say it's on par kind of with the other health organization that I work with, who they've got epic, and you just do the same thing. But in epic. So.

23
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:28.089
Tyler: Awesome, that's great. And what about if you had like a question for the Va. That wasn't related to your health care? Do you know what you would do first.st

24
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.219
> P4: Not a clue.

25
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.340
Tyler: Okay. Then.

26
00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.420
> P4: Like big fat giant question mark.

27
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.890
Tyler: Okay.

28
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.739
> P4: Well, like, I know, like I have one like my

29
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:41.730
> P4: survivor. Benefit plan, like, for some reason, like the withdrawal amount is like off by like 5 cents.

30
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:42.620
Tyler: Okay.

31
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.720
> P4: Every month. So now I've got like a bill over a couple of years of like 20 bucks. I have no idea who to reach out to

32
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.709
> P4: literally like you can call the number at the [location] office, and then it's like welcome to the phone tree from hell.

33
00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:54.550
Tyler: So like.

34
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.160
> P4: That's a good example of something I've been trying to figure out for years and have made 0 progress.

35
00:02:59.477 --> 00:03:15.650
Tyler: That makes sense. It's unfortunately, it does sound like a common experience for veterans. Where it might be more clear, how to deal with like health issues. But for other things it might be less clear. So we're gonna talk a little bit about that today. Have you heard of? Ask Va.

36
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:16.630
> P4: I have.

37
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.370
Tyler: Okay, have you used it?

38
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:27.489
> P4: I played around with it a couple of months ago, and then just got sidetracked. I probably should have used it for the thing that like I was just talking about, but I haven't even tried.

39
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:43.349
Tyler: That's okay. And there might be different reasons that are hard to remember for for why that is. But they might come up today. So we can. We can talk about that a little bit more. Awesome. And you said you kind of are not having great experiences in terms of calling and ending up in the phone tree situation.

40
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:53.020
> P4: Yeah, I mean, if you're trying to call anyone in the Va health care non healthcare, like just good luck. And like, what are you gonna do like mail something.

41
00:03:53.450 --> 00:04:01.080
> P4: I mean, it's just it's really convoluted and hard just to get to the right department, because then they'll typically like, be the alphabet soup of acronyms.

42
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:09.839
> P4: So it's just really confusing, like, even if you could get the phone tree. Because, oh, hey, I'm trying to get to like your finance department because.

43
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.160
Tyler: In her.

44
00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:20.700
> P4: I'm gonna get something with like my retirement pay fixed. Well, it's probably not called the finance department. It's probably called some other acronym that you don't know. So you call and like, try and use that. But then.

45
00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.320
> P4: Whoever's on the other end. They don't understand you.

46
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:24.000
Tyler: Yeah.

47
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.230
> P4: Refer to it with another tongue. So yeah.

48
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.830
Tyler: Yes.

49
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.230
Tyler: that's a great yeah. That's a definitely a good sort of pain point you've

50
00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.979
Tyler: picked up on where it can be a little bit hard to figure out

51
00:04:36.333 --> 00:04:57.600
Tyler: how to get directly in touch with someone at the Va. So we will talk a little bit more about that and I. And I did mention we wanted to talk a little bit more about your how you're using your assistive technology before we start. So we talked about how you're using voice over. And right now you're on your desktop computer. How long have you been using voiceover.

52
00:04:58.165 --> 00:05:03.520
> P4: About 2 years now, and I certainly would not say like, I'm an expert, so I'll probably.

53
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:15.840
> P4: Some stuff today. But you know, really, I work remotely so like heavy on my PC, most of the day. So that's like super helpful, just being able to pick up on the things that I would have otherwise missed.

54
00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.780
> P4: Voiceover will catch it.

55
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:24.629
Tyler: Is that why you're mostly using voice over because it's like it feels more like comprehensive.

56
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:36.609
> P4: It does. It's like I I feel like I would just be missing things in conversations. I just wouldn't pick up on it. But it's kind of nice when you just have the little box down at the bottom left to just to be able to confirm like, okay, I did hear that correctly.

57
00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.789
> P4: Or alright. I am reading that the right way now that it's kind of blown out. That big text.

58
00:05:41.094 --> 00:05:50.519
Tyler: Yeah, that might that makes sense. So it's sort of like an extra confirmation, and it's kind of become part of your toolkit. How how often are you using it?

59
00:05:50.740 --> 00:06:00.919
> P4: Using it every day. The only time I'll turn off like, if I'm in like a busy conference call, and then it's just stepping on everything I like. I'll turn it off then, because then it's just counterproductive.

60
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:14.649
> P4: But I would say I use it. At least, you know, a couple of times a day, you know, I'm typically doing like hour increments with meetings, you know, like have one for an hour get like a half an hour off and back into it, so kind of sporadically throughout the day, but probably good half the day.

61
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:24.990
Tyler: Yeah, awesome. Are there certain tasks where it feels more useful for you to use voice over compared to others? Or it's just in general, when you're on the computer, you're mostly using it.

62
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.660
> P4: I would say, typically, general.

63
00:06:28.032 --> 00:06:34.570
> P4: there's nothing that kind of really jumps out to me is, you know, hey? This is really a lot more helpful than something else.

64
00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:35.440
Tyler: Okay. Awesome.

65
00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:43.489
Tyler: Cool. Okay, that sounds good. So Maria, I just wanted to ask if you had any other questions before we we move on to sharing screen.

66
00:06:44.925 --> 00:06:48.760
Maria: Yes, I was gonna ask. So you use a voiceover. Do you also

67
00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:54.090
Maria: forgive my question? If this is a bit rude? Do you have residual vision. If

68
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.270
Maria: I'm correct.

69
00:06:55.530 --> 00:07:02.059
> P4: I don't even know what residual vision is. Could you give me a little bit more on that one? I can tell you I'm colorblind, which really makes things super awesome.

70
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.320
Maria: Oh, oh, my! Gosh! Me too! I will like.

71
00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.050
> P4: Oh, yeah, there we go.

72
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.445
Maria: In general. They're oh, my gosh! We're like besties!

73
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.740
> P4: It's like right next to each other on the color wheel. I'm like, I don't. I don't know what that is like.

74
00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.140
> P4: I can't help you.

75
00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:18.020
Maria: I totally understand. Do you use your vision when you're also using voice over.

76
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.089
> P4: No cause. I don't know how to, but if you've got tricks

77
00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:23.620
> P4: oh, I would love to hear about it.

78
00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:31.340
Maria: Understandable. I currently do not have any tricks up my sleeve anymore. I also do not use my vision when using voiceover.

79
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:32.750
> P4: Fair enough.

80
00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.690
> P4: worth a shot.

81
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:35.720
Maria: That's right.

82
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.680
Maria: Yeah, that's all my questions. Thank you.

83
00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:40.900
Tyler: Thanks, Maria.

84
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:50.870
Tyler: Okay, cool. So let's go ahead and move forward. So we're gonna have you share your screen on zoom. Have you done that before.

85
00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.969
> P4: Oh, more times than I could count.

86
00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:54.710
Tyler: Okay.

87
00:07:54.930 --> 00:08:00.200
Tyler: So once you've done that or while you're doing that, I'm going to send over a link to

88
00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.000
Tyler: the tool.

89
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:02.920
> P4: Okay, perfect

90
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:11.279
> P4: me pull that up.

91
00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:13.209
> P4: I think I need to do the whole

92
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.460
> P4: desktop.

93
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:18.565
> P4: But

94
00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:20.860
> P4: alright.

95
00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:36.349
Tyler: Okay, perfect. So now I think I can just see like your desktop background. And so I'm gonna send you a link in the chat on zoom and then you can open that on your in your browser.

96
00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:46.110
> P4: Hide all the rest of that junk.

97
00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:48.300
Tyler: Perfect.

98
00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:48.950
> P4: Sweet.

99
00:08:54.640 --> 00:09:02.039
Tyler: And so it looks like you're using. Your mouse as well. Do you use your keyboard as well when you're using voice over.

100
00:09:02.773 --> 00:09:04.689
> P4: I mainly use my maps.

101
00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:06.060
Tyler: Okay, cool.

### Dashboard

Tyler: Awesome. So we're all set up. This is the the website that we're going to be looking at together today. And what we can do is navigate to where it says research study. And then we're just gonna click on that sign in link

103
00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:25.869
Tyler: perfect. Okay?

104
00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:42.611
Tyler: So we're gonna sit tight for a second, and I'm gonna give you some background before we start exploring the website together. So this is a, this is a a tool called Ask Va, you said you've had some experience. At least, looking through. What? Ask? Va is

105
00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:56.100
Tyler: But there's basically a way for veterans to contact the Va. If they have a question in today's session, we're gonna pretend, like you've recently asked the Va. A question. And today you've signed into your account.

106
00:09:56.523 --> 00:10:03.569
Tyler: So you're on va.gov, you're in your account, and you're here because you want to read the Va's reply to your question

107
00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:04.690
Tyler: so.

108
00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:05.290
> P4: Okay.

109
00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:22.090
Tyler: We're gonna go through a couple of different tasks, and I'm gonna explain them as we go. So you don't have to remember everything but as you navigate, we really want to understand, like what's going through your mind. How is your assistive technology supporting you? When are things like not clear and things like that.

110
00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:34.693
Tyler: When you're focused on a task. I hopefully should be able to hear your screen, reader, although I haven't heard it yet. Which is not yeah, which is not a problem.

111
00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:43.364
Tyler: it might be because, when you share your screen on zoom, it sometimes doesn't share the sound.

112
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:47.360
Tyler: so we can either change that or I can

113
00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:57.639
Tyler: carry on like this. And I'll just be able to see your screen, reader, like where you're focused, and if you're talking if it's talking sorry, and I'm going to try and avoid talking over it.

114
00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:01.890
> P4: Okay, I live in a team's world so that.

115
00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:02.350
Tyler: Okay.

116
00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:05.129
> P4: I don't automatically know where that setting is, but.

117
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:05.610
Tyler: Do I just need.

118
00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:08.200
> P4: Unshare, and then, when I reshare, is there like a.

119
00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:08.589
Tyler: Yeah, well.

120
00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:09.570
> P4: Where you can.

121
00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:27.040
Tyler: Let's try it again. So yeah, if you go back to zoom and then unshare, and then when you click share there should be an option. It's obviously asking you which screen, and then there should be options on the right hand side, and one of them is a checkbox that says, Share sound.

122
00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.040
> P4: Yes.

123
00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.170
Tyler: Okay, let's try that.

124
00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:34.189
Tyler: You have started screen share. Zoom.

125
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:38.700
> P4: Has new system, dialogue, zoom us has new system, dialogue.

126
00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:39.650
Tyler: That's right.

127
00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:44.529
> P4: On a button group to click this button press control option space.

128
00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:46.899
Tyler: Awesome. Okay.

129
00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:54.170
Tyler: I'm I'm a little confused which button it thinks you're on. But I can hear your screen, reader, which is awesome. So.

130
00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:56.070
> P4: It's been a little wonky today.

131
00:11:56.070 --> 00:12:13.360
Tyler: Okay, so this is perfect and basically, while you're navigating, I'm gonna try and stay quiet when your screen reader is announcing and then, if it's helpful, if you just kind of pause every once in a while, so we can chat about what's going on. Do you have any questions for me before we start.

132
00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:14.630
> P4: I do not.

133
00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:24.280
Tyler: Okay, cool and like, I said, I just wanna remind you that instead of making you sign in today, we're gonna pretend like you're signed into your account. Okay?

134
00:12:24.579 --> 00:12:39.649
Tyler: Alright. So you've just arrived at. Ask Va and the 1st thing that I'd like you to do is orient yourself on this page. So I'm going to give you a couple of minutes to navigate around. And and after you finish I'd just like you to explain what's on this page to me.

135
00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.569
> P4: I mean, just kind of starting off.

136
00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:56.509
> P4: It's definitely, you know, kind of same layout as the my healthy vet. It's the typical bland, boring government website. That's just everything's white. And you know, same colors. And it's just grab. It's just so.

137
00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:56.880
Tyler: Okay.

138
00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.200
> P4: Drop. But you know

139
00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:08.409
> P4: the layout is just. It's exactly the same. It is pretty intuitive when, particularly when you look up to the ribbons up to the top like benefits about Va.

140
00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:10.739
> P4: it's kind of an easy.

141
00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:29.049
> P4: you know. Call it a link. I'm gonna use the term link tree, because I think I just made that up. So feel free to to do that, you know. Steal it before I copyright it to be able to just kind of like drill down into the different menus and I definitely kind of see, probably like one of the more annoying things about the Va websites is like there's so many

142
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:30.759
> P4: things that you have to click to.

143
00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:31.140
Tyler: See him.

144
00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:36.799
> P4: Get to where you want to go, and, like a lot of them, are kind of redundant, in my opinion, like.

145
00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:41.250
> P4: Why would you have to go from home to contact us to Sba?

146
00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:47.840
> P4: But why would you just not have like in the homepage like? Oh, here, click, Sva, and bring you right to this menu.

147
00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.160
> P4: Instead of having to take another step to

148
00:13:50.290 --> 00:14:03.390
> P4: basically do nothing. But you know, that's just the way that you know the Va websites are designed. So that's kind of one of the things that I always wish could just be a little more streamlined. Just make easier to kind of

149
00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.200
> P4: trying to find what you're looking for.

150
00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:17.400
Tyler: Okay, that makes sense. So you're already picking up on quite a bit, especially about like sort of the structure of of the website, and how we've ended up at ask Va, that's super helpful.

151
00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.989
Tyler: What else are you noticing on this page?

152
00:14:21.749 --> 00:14:46.300
> P4: Looks pretty similar, you know, in other areas where, like, if you've had any form of contact, call it like an inquiry, a query. Something like that, you know. Here's kind of your history the filters are pretty similar, you know. They've always got the option of you know what's newest, oldest, or oldest to newest and an ability to filter at least by something whether it is a status or kind of category like they have here.

153
00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:47.580
> P4: it

154
00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.552
> P4: is a little useful.

155
00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:58.709
> P4: but I would just, you know, say, it is pretty similar to like what I've seen where sometimes like. It's just all over the place from a logic standpoint

156
00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:05.649
> P4: where you know. I mean, you would think it would just default to. You know, this filter right here the newest, oldest kind of like.

157
00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:06.140
Tyler: You.

158
00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:20.969
> P4: See it here, which you know it's fun but then, you know, other times in different areas of the Va websites is just like chaos, where they'll try and group it under some weird category that just doesn't make sense. And it just becomes super confusing to find what you're looking for.

159
00:15:21.263 --> 00:15:26.839
Tyler: Okay, that makes sense. So definitely, a couple of things, you're picking up on is just sort of like

160
00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:30.820
Tyler: the categorization of things on va websites

161
00:15:31.282 --> 00:15:36.447
Tyler: and and you did mention that this is a place where you could ask a question.

162
00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:41.639
Tyler: let's let's navigate down to your past questions.

163
00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:44.790
> P4: Okay.

164
00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:48.710
> P4: Yeah.

165
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:54.330
Tyler: Okay. And what can you describe what information is available here under your past questions?

166
00:15:55.506 --> 00:16:03.919
> P4: Something like there was something about disability, an Id card. And then I don't know if it's like a password reset, or, you know some

167
00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:06.750
> P4: access issue down below.

168
00:16:07.077 --> 00:16:13.960
Tyler: Okay, so you've noticed some of the questions that that have been asked and whose question who asked these questions.

169
00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:16.650
> P4: It should be me.

170
00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:17.550
Tyler: Okay. Okay.

171
00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:18.600
> P4: I would think.

172
00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:25.239
Tyler: Cool that makes sense. So this is a place where you can find the questions that you've asked the Va. Because you're in your account.

173
00:16:25.697 --> 00:16:30.879
Tyler: And you've kind of given me an overview of some of the questions that are here. So

174
00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:34.319
Tyler: the the next thing I'd like you to do. Obviously there's a couple of

175
00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:39.709
Tyler: questions here. I'd like you to find a question that has a reply from the Va.

176
00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:43.800
> P4: Alright. You got both of them down here, these 2.

177
00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:44.980
Tyler: Okay.

178
00:16:46.650 --> 00:17:00.419
Tyler: cool. So we're we found 2 questions that are that have a reply. Is there any other way of finding them? It looks like you kind of like visually just looked at the page and and noticed that there was these 2 at the bottom. How did you figure out they were.

179
00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:05.510
> P4: I just saw the big, big, bold title up there. But then.

180
00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:17.699
> P4: if I didn't use that, I I would probably try my ask Va integration project, vertical line veterans affairs, Google, chrome window heading, level one. Ask, Va.

181
00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:21.299
> P4: you are currently on a heading level. One sober response.

182
00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:30.150
> P4: But yeah, I would probably, if I'm gonna take a guess at you know what's option number 2 for finding that it would be

183
00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:32.159
> P4: clicking the filter by status.

184
00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.939
Tyler: Okay, let's go ahead and try that.

185
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:37.890
Tyler: Oh.

186
00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:39.030
> P4: Menu. Item.

187
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:47.180
> P4: you are currently on a menu item, to choose this menu item, press control, option space to close this menu, press escape

188
00:17:50.282 --> 00:17:54.379
> P4: voiceovers, and picking up what the options are.

189
00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:58.139
> P4: But Hello! Anyways.

190
00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.329
Tyler: Yeah, so I can see

191
00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:09.699
Tyler: just for observers as well on the call you. You've got your mouse kind of hovering over, replied, but the focus is on all.

192
00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:23.199
Tyler: okay, so let's go ahead and click on replied. And let's see if we can filter that reply. You are currently on a button to display a list of options, press control, option, space.

193
00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:29.725
> P4: Okay. Looks like there was the 2 that I saw, and another one

194
00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:37.410
> P4: It's like it was just, you know, further time, period, longer history about housing.

195
00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:38.150
Tyler: Okay.

196
00:18:38.646 --> 00:18:39.640
> P4: Coe is

197
00:18:40.623 --> 00:18:45.720
> P4: eligibility. God! I just they beat the brainwashing into your head.

198
00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:49.040
Tyler: So that makes sense that

199
00:18:49.620 --> 00:19:04.110
Tyler: you. You see the questions that you had previously mentioned to me. But there's also this new question here. Is there any other way to figure out? If you have a reply from the Va. Other than that big, bold label that you mentioned to me.

200
00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:09.800
> P4: I mean that filter, but I mean I guess I can. Menu. Item. Oh, no, not helpful

201
00:19:11.024 --> 00:19:13.209
> P4: if I wanted to, you know.

202
00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:15.300
> P4: Go down by these categories.

203
00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:21.699
> P4: All filter by category. Menu! Pop up! Collapsed button.

204
00:19:22.966 --> 00:19:35.429
Tyler: Let's go ahead and filter by status, and we'll just click all so that we can menu. Item everything again. You are currently on a button to display a list of options, press control, option, space!

205
00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:40.689
Tyler: Oh, perfect filter by all, filter by status, menu pop.

206
00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:42.230
> P4: Up expanded. Button.

207
00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:44.250
> P4: Sorry.

208
00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:45.000
Tyler: That's okay.

209
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:45.610
> P4: Strokes.

210
00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:49.698
Tyler: Yeah, no worries. So usually you're navigating, but using your mouse,

211
00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:50.680
> P4: Yes.

212
00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.493
Tyler: Okay, so

213
00:19:53.870 --> 00:20:01.009
Tyler: we've got these different labels, the bold labels you mentioned, replied, what else do we have on this page?

214
00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:03.440
> P4: We've got in progress

215
00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:08.010
> P4: and reopened, which I have no idea what reopened would be.

216
00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:11.100
Tyler: Okay, so in progress feels more clear.

217
00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:15.012
> P4: It does. You know something that's actively being worked?

218
00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:24.649
> P4: I mean replied also isn't super clear. But I mean I could. You can at least tell like there has been one response, okay? And then reopened.

219
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:26.310
Tyler: Okay.

220
00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:28.429
Tyler: okay, that makes sense.

221
00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:33.661
Tyler: and we'll talk a little bit more about reopened in a second.

222
00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:43.660
Tyler: the next thing I want you to do is find a question that's related to home loans. So we talked about it a bit earlier. So could you find that question.

223
00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:49.859
> P4: All menu, item, menu, 6. Housing assistance and home loans.

224
00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:55.550
Tyler: You are currently on a button to display a list of auctions. Press control auction space.

225
00:20:57.530 --> 00:21:05.540
Tyler: Okay? Awesome. So do you know why you weren't able to to see that option earlier until you filtered by category. Is that clear?

226
00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:11.559
> P4: I'm assuming, because this is in 2,023, and everything else was 24.

227
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:13.079
> P4: It's my gas.

228
00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:23.385
Tyler: Okay, Gotcha. So because it's older, you're you're thinking maybe it wasn't present on the page.

229
00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:30.859
> P4: You know, some kind of limitation on the page where it can only display X number of, you know, responses.

230
00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:45.490
Tyler: okay, Gotcha, and while we've been doing this, we've changed some filters, we've looked through some questions, have you how is how has your voice over been supporting you at all?

231
00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:47.060
> P4: Oh, it's been terrible.

232
00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:49.480
Tyler: In in what way?

233
00:21:50.277 --> 00:21:57.580
> P4: Well, you know, it's not really providing any description of the actual content itself. It's more like you clicked a button

234
00:21:57.976 --> 00:22:00.280
> P4: to click, button, click the button, you know.

235
00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:00.660
Tyler: No hurry.

236
00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:05.580
> P4: That's actually helpful, for, you know, giving you context on the content.

237
00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:11.150
Tyler: Okay. And so what are you expecting? Like? What would be more helpful if you could give me an example.

238
00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:18.110
> P4: Oh, yeah, like, when selecting a filter instead of housing assistance and home loans. Menu. Item, menu, 6 items.

239
00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:20.170
> P4: You are currently in a menu.

240
00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:22.360
> P4: so that was a little bit better, at least.

241
00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:25.179
Tyler: yeah, that.

242
00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:28.930
> P4: Now, you know, it would be better if it was. You know. Here are the menu items.

243
00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:46.678
Tyler: Gotcha. Okay? So I think it's probably because you're using your mouse that it's not always announcing and and that's that might be why, it's not working the way you potentially expect it to. But now I better understand kind of what you're hoping that it would say.

244
00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:49.370
Tyler: okay. So

245
00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:54.980
Tyler: we also have something that lets you change the questions.

246
00:22:55.821 --> 00:22:59.029
Tyler: Based on the date they were last updated.

247
00:22:59.652 --> 00:23:08.109
Tyler: Can you? You, you might need to choose all on this filter, 1st housing, assistance, housing, assistance and all.

248
00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:13.889
Tyler: You are currently on a button to display a list of options. Press control auction space.

249
00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:22.640
Tyler: How do you think, or do you think you would use the filter that says newest to oldest or oldest to newest.

250
00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:32.940
> P4: I mean, I would probably keep it on this setting. I'm typically looking for the most recent information. I want to play around with it newest menu. Item, it's pretty

251
00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:36.249
> P4: straightforward with what your options are.

252
00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:48.379
Tyler: Okay, cool. So you most likely would always have it on newest to oldest, because you most likely would be looking for like something that's recently happened, which which makes sense. Okay.

253
00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:55.269
> P4: That's what I would want for default. And you know there may be a situation where I don't know. I gotta look up something old, and then I would flip it.

254
00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:56.660
Tyler: Okay.

255
00:23:57.250 --> 00:23:58.025
Tyler: cool,

256
00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:05.580
Tyler: so the last task on this page is just to find a question that you submitted on august 24, th

257
00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:08.830
Tyler: so can you just show me how you would find that.

258
00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:14.319
> P4: I would just start scrolling with the dates. So that was pretty easy.

259
00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:19.439
Tyler: Okay, cool. So you submitted that question. August 24.th And what is this question about.

260
00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:23.329
> P4: That is getting a spouse, a Va. Card.

261
00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:24.280
Tyler: Okay.

### Details page

Tyler: cool. How would you read the reply from the Va. On this question? If if they have, replied.

263
00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:38.699
> P4: I would try to click the details. The check details link right here.

264
00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:41.220
Tyler: Okay, let's go ahead and do that

265
00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:45.900
Tyler: newest to oldest last updated menu. Pop up, link, heading level.

266
00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:47.940
> P4: One question details.

267
00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:50.469
> P4: You are currently on a heading level one.

268
00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.680
> P4: Okay.

269
00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:56.720
> P4: just

270
00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:01.946
> P4: why do you have the conversation set up with

271
00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:05.510
> P4: The kind of the expanded boxes.

272
00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:09.890
> P4: I don't know. I would just think, you know. Why would you not just have it, you know. Here's

273
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:19.979
> P4: August 24th September second, September 12, th 2,024, at 11 0 4 Amet. Your reply to Va. Collapsed.

274
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:21.040
Tyler: Group.

275
00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:21.740
Tyler: Yeah.

276
00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:29.229
> P4: Potentially on a heading level 3, you know, particularly like with the structure you could go, you know, most recent to boldest whatever which is

277
00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:35.430
> P4: again, it's kind of like the theme I was hitting on earlier of, like, you're always just clicking things unnecessarily.

278
00:25:36.013 --> 00:25:40.500
> P4: That just it's not even providing any value. It's more of like you're just doing extra work.

279
00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:47.950
> P4: So if it just came to this page, and you know, kind of was already broken down like this. I mean, I think that's fine. It's definitely better.

280
00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:55.719
Tyler: Okay, got it. So you are not a fan of the accordions which makes sense when you you said earlier that you

281
00:25:56.213 --> 00:26:08.867
Tyler: feel like you're always having to click around on Va like longer, like more clicks than you would expect. And that's obviously what happened here. So you're not a big fan of that which which makes sense.

282
00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:16.980
Tyler: you pretty quickly went and expanded each one of those sort of on their own. And

283
00:26:17.413 --> 00:26:26.960
Tyler: there's some information within the these accordions. Right? So what's can you tell me like kind of just going down the page? What we have? 11.

284
00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:34.530
> P4: 4 button group, and then you can reply and

285
00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:41.759
> P4: option to upload documentation or picture. I don't know something that's probably associated with potential. Ask.

286
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:46.589
> P4: and then a send button. And then, kinda as always, you know, there's a phone number

287
00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:48.660
> P4: and general hours of operation.

288
00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.480
Tyler: Okay.

289
00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:54.670
Tyler: awesome. And so let's

290
00:26:54.760 --> 00:27:09.330
Tyler: let's sort of zoom in on the and figuratively, speaking on the reply from the va, so I'm going to give you a minute to read what the Va. Has replied to your question, and then I'd love for you to just explain to me what they're saying.

291
00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:16.650
> P4: Oh, a standard. Va, response, no. And then go to this link to read more, because we're just not going to tell you.

292
00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.459
> P4: Like par for the par for the course.

293
00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:20.160
Tyler: Okay.

294
00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:22.800
Tyler: So it doesn't feel like they've given me.

295
00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:26.779
> P4: No, no, I don't feel like it's a comprehensive approach, although I mean

296
00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:35.609
> P4: the yeah, there's just a lot of room for improvement like, okay, there isn't a card available, you know, for family members, but you know

297
00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:48.169
> P4: you could just improve the customer service, call it, you know. Put a little bit lighter. Touch on it, or you know, here is another option to be able to solve. Whatever the problem is that someone is reaching out about.

298
00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:49.739
Tyler: Yeah.

299
00:27:50.380 --> 00:28:09.760
Tyler: so obviously not loving, how comprehensive? The responses and you also feel like it could offer like more help like, okay, you could do this instead. I'm curious, like as we're as we're navigating through this page. Your voice over is obviously not reading these responses aloud to you

300
00:28:10.137 --> 00:28:14.070
Tyler: is that normally something that you would expect or find helpful.

301
00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:19.050
> P4: I would. And again it could be operator error where

302
00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:22.990
> P4: maybe I'm not using voice over right. But typically like, if I just hover.

303
00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:26.270
> P4: it'll read what's in the text box.

304
00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:27.190
Tyler: Okay.

305
00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:29.280
> P4: Maybe maybe Maria can

306
00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:30.580
> P4: check me.

307
00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:39.639
Maria: If you tap to the various accordions, and if they're already been expanded, you can use the up and down arrow keys to like

308
00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:42.220
Maria: navigate through the text.

309
00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:46.099
Maria: But the focus has to be on the accordion control. First.st

310
00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:48.560
> P4: Right here.

311
00:28:49.160 --> 00:29:00.223
Tyler: So right now, your focus is on that September 12th one, and what Maria saying is, if you were tabbing instead of using your mouth your key. Sorry, mouse.

312
00:29:01.264 --> 00:29:03.840
Tyler: Then that would change.

313
00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:06.659
> P4: Oh, I'm using my keyboard now.

314
00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:10.719
Maria: Press F to see if you can pop into forms mode.

315
00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:16.209
Maria: because sometimes, if you're using your mouse and voiceover at the same time, voiceover gets like kind of confused.

316
00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:20.309
> P4: Just letter F, and up or down.

317
00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:23.739
Maria: like it should sound like a.

318
00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:26.580
> P4: Or do I need to use the control key with it?

319
00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:28.310
Maria: Just f.

320
00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:30.690
> P4: Yeah, nothing.

321
00:29:31.577 --> 00:29:34.439
Maria: Try refreshing the page use control. R,

322
00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:50.870
Maria: reload this page, ask heading, level one quick link, skip to content, link skit to content us. Flag image, an official web heading level. One question, details main. You are currently on a heading level, one

323
00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:52.290
Maria: tab

324
00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:55.650
Maria: print button group.

325
00:29:55.890 --> 00:30:05.849
Maria: You expand all accordions collapsed. Button, you are currently collapse. All accordions expanded. Button, August 24, th 2,024 at one.

326
00:30:05.850 --> 00:30:10.559
> P4: 14 pm. Et your question expanded. Button Group.

327
00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.269
> P4: You are currently on a heading level 3,

328
00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:19.345
> P4: I mean definitely better, but particularly for someone like me that likes using the mouse more.

329
00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:20.900
> P4: That would help.

330
00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:23.769
Maria: I see, I see.

331
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.680
> P4: I don't want to take us too far off topic.

332
00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:30.229
Tyler: Well, that's that's pretty on topic.

333
00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:32.399
> P4: Oh, okay. Well, there we there we go.

334
00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:42.729
Tyler: Yeah. So it sounds like you're usually you're almost always navigating with your mouse when you use voice over on other websites.

335
00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:48.380
> P4: Absolutely anything on the website. The only time I'm really using keystroke is excel.

336
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:49.790
Tyler: Okay.

337
00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:54.558
Tyler: okay, gotcha, yeah. So I mean, obviously,

338
00:30:56.120 --> 00:31:01.979
Tyler: what? Maria's kind of shown here for us is that using the keyword.

339
00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:20.069
Tyler: we would expect to hear a lot more from the screen reader announcing versus hovering with with the mouse. But this is still helpful either way, to see how you're navigating. It's it seems like you are looking at the page visually to to read a lot of these a lot a lot of the content.

340
00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:21.120
> P4: Oh, yeah.

341
00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:31.789
Tyler: Okay, awesome. Let me just remind myself of what we were chatting about prior to that. So we had just read the reply from the Va.

342
00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:39.369
Tyler: And if you like, you can tab to to hear the screen. Reader announce the reply. September 12.th Your message, star.

343
00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:49.660
> P4: Edit text cursor actions are available to navigate to them press control, cursor actions are available to navigate to them press control option. J.

344
00:31:52.180 --> 00:32:01.880
Tyler: Yeah, so it looks like you tabbed through the accordions. And then, now you've ended up in the message box. Right? Okay.

345
00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:05.140
> P4: So I didn't hit enter, because I'm definitely not accustomed to the keystroke.

346
00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:15.796
Tyler: Yeah, that's totally fine. And and you know, like we said at the beginning, this is obviously a tool that takes a lot of practice to use, and people might use it in different ways. And so

### Reply sent

Tyler: we've read this reply from the Va. And obviously you had kind of your own interpretation of what they replied. And what I'd like to do now is just to imagine that you wanted to reply back to the va so I know that might not be what you would do. But let's pretend, like you were going to reply back to the Va. So you can go ahead and write the Va. A short message. Don't worry too much about what it says, and then when you feel ready, you can send

348
00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:47.889
Tyler: Europe, c. 6, c. You are current CC.

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:15.680
Tyler: Okay, yeah. Awesome.

355
00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:16.860
> P4: Get a response in.

356
00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:23.780
Tyler: Okay, cool. So you've written your response. And then we're using the mouse to click. Send. Whenever you're ready. You can send your message.

357
00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:28.240
Tyler: Send button. Your response was submitted successfully. Group.

358
00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:30.190
Tyler: you are currently on a group.

359
00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:35.036
Tyler: Okay? Awesome. And then on this page,

360
00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:40.909
Tyler: go ahead and just read this page to me, and then let me. Can you just let me know what it's telling you?

361
00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:54.639
> P4: Oh, response, and thank you for sending response. Your question has now been reopened. You should receive a fly within 7 business days. If we need more information for your question, we'll contact you. Yeah. My thought is again, what?

362
00:33:55.300 --> 00:34:01.120
> P4: What other organization in a different part of your life? Would you be okay with a 7 day business response, timeframe.

363
00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:01.460
Tyler: And.

364
00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:02.190
> P4: Question.

365
00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:03.200
Tyler: Yeah.

366
00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:05.230
> P4: How could you have to click your bank?

367
00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:07.160
> P4: Told you that.

368
00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:08.870
Tyler: And your doctor like you.

369
00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:11.649
> P4: You wouldn't accept that. But that's the Va.

370
00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:12.460
Tyler: And.

371
00:34:13.150 --> 00:34:13.830
> P4: Yeah.

372
00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:20.220
Tyler: Yeah. So immediately frustrated by it, taking 7 business days to hear back from the Va

373
00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:24.380
> P4: That's business days, too. That's not even like days. Yes, that's even worse.

374
00:34:25.838 --> 00:34:41.669
Tyler: another thing I'm noticing on this page is it says, your question has now been reopened and at the beginning we talked about how reopen was confusing. Does it feel more clear what it's meant to to imply? Or it's still unclear.

375
00:34:42.489 --> 00:34:46.548
> P4: I would recommend a different choice of of verbiage.

376
00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:53.500
> P4: Because now, if you know, basically, if you are responding to a Va response.

377
00:34:53.969 --> 00:35:01.240
> P4: the implied action that I'm walking away with is okay. The Va. Has responded. They're now automatically closing this.

378
00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:13.420
> P4: Like, you're not even gonna consider the possibility that you know. Potentially, the question hasn't been answered, or there could be additional information that would be requested. So.

379
00:35:14.830 --> 00:35:16.829
> P4: Yeah, reopen just

380
00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:19.730
> P4: not the greatest choice of words. In my opinion.

381
00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:21.010
Tyler: Yeah.

382
00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:33.060
Tyler: what? What kind of if you had to summarize it as a word, or maybe even a couple of words? How would you better summarize like what's actually happened here, if it's if not reopened.

383
00:35:33.650 --> 00:35:38.740
> P4: I would probably just use. Your question has now been

384
00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:39.960
> P4: submitted.

385
00:35:40.930 --> 00:35:41.710
Tyler: Okay.

386
00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:49.410
> P4: You know it kind of gives them that, you know. Alright, hey? You know it's reasonable. You submit a question. They're gonna have to get it assigned to somebody. They're gonna have to draft a response.

387
00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:59.650
> P4: It's just a little more straightforward. And I think it's not gonna leave that perception of, you know. Oh, well, we sent you one answer, whether you like it or not. This is now closed.

388
00:36:00.537 --> 00:36:05.580
Tyler: Okay, Gotcha, so you're more, you're more wanna be aware of like what the last step was that you took which in this case would be. I submitted this, and then, if the Va. Replied back to you, what would the status be?

390
00:36:15.663 --> 00:36:20.940
> P4: I would say it's probably response sent, I mean, just even kind of from like a a process

391
00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:24.640
> P4: standpoint, you know, if you're looking at like a process flow, you know.

392
00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:31.080
> P4: Question submitted response. Sent? You know, even if you're adding in the option of

393
00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:37.270
> P4: you know, hey, veteran, you know something along the lines of? Has your question been answered.

394
00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:42.349
> P4: Do you feel comfortable with the response that you've been given, you know, just to close the loop on anything.

395
00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:44.970
Tyler: Okay, Gotcha. So at some point.

396
00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:47.539
Tyler: at some point, the veteran might say

Tyler: you know this, that I feel like this can be closed like this. My question has been answered.

399
00:36:56.950 --> 00:37:12.669
> P4: Or even like. Well, you know I don't know about you, but like when you call your bank, and you're talking to them about whatever. And you know your bank is helping out with something. You know they always close it with, Okay, is there anything else that I can do for you today, have we, you know, been able to meet whatever the need is for what you have called us about?

400
00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:19.240
> P4: Yes, no, you know. Just again, kind of bring in essentially just, better customer service.

401
00:37:19.930 --> 00:37:24.380
> P4: To the equation, which would be like a landmark achievement for the Va.

402
00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.120
Tyler: Yeah, for sure

403
00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:29.437
Tyler: that that makes a lot of sense to me. And obviously,

404
00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:35.750
Tyler: I think people's past experiences with the Va come up a lot in these conversations, and I guess the ability to be able to say I've had my question answered. Now I'm good, is is maybe a little bit of a different relationship than most people have with the Va. So I can. I can see how that would be useful and a better experience. We were all finished testing this. So if you like, you can keep sharing your screen. But you can also stop sharing your screen, and we'll just chat for the last couple of minutes before we wrap up.

407
00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:08.530
> P4: Right.

### Cool down

Tyler: Okay, awesome. So overall. How did you find that process.

409
00:38:19.059 --> 00:38:26.410
> P4: I would say, you know very much in line with normal experience using Va technology now,

410
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:32.139
> P4: different in a good way, not different in a bad way. Just very much part of the course.

411
00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:34.780
Tyler: that makes sense. And

412
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:39.010
Tyler: one of the reasons, I think that you're saying that that, we talked about is

413
00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:47.725
Tyler: this sort of like nesting that happens on va websites where you're like, I want to get to this page. But it takes me a lot of clicks to get there.

414
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:48.950
> P4: Yes.

415
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:52.140
Tyler: Is there anything else that felt familiar about this.

416
00:38:53.028 --> 00:39:14.990
> P4: Just the lack of like a search bar which again, super on par with, you know, any government website where you know, it's just a star contrast with, like any commercial or private company, you know. You go to their web page and you wanna search for something, and you can just go right up to a little search bar typically top right? Put in whatever you need. And then boom! Here's, you know, a menu.

417
00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:23.229
> P4: And then you could just typically find what you're looking for, even on the Va. Because I I've seen in a couple of areas. Maybe it's like my healthy bed.

418
00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:27.509
> P4: But other government websites like, even if they have the search bar

419
00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:36.270
> P4: and you try to look for something really boiled late. It's not going to give you a decent response. So I mean, it's borderline. Why bother.

420
00:39:36.845 --> 00:39:37.420
Tyler: Yeah.

421
00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:38.460
> P4: Not effective.

422
00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:40.030
Tyler: Yeah, totally.

423
00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:46.340
Tyler: And we talked at the very beginning about how you're using my healthy vet to message with your primary care team.

424
00:39:46.370 --> 00:39:53.958
Tyler: And you said that that I think you said that that's usually like a a pretty good experience, and they get back to you a bit sooner.

425
00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:59.270
Tyler: which is great. How do these experiences compare.

426
00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:05.890
> P4: I mean overall kind of look, and feel very much the same.

427
00:40:06.755 --> 00:40:08.780
> P4: My healthy vet is actually.

428
00:40:09.210 --> 00:40:11.429
> P4: I would say, it's pretty intuitive.

429
00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:15.259
> P4: The nesting is not anywhere near as bad.

430
00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:15.620
Tyler: Okay.

431
00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:23.599
> P4: I mean, there's still a little bit of it, but you can generally find your way to what you're looking for with a couple of less clicks.

432
00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:26.929
> P4: Because it's just a smaller amount of nesting.

433
00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:30.530
Tyler: Gotcha, okay? So that's 1 of the reasons. It might be

434
00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:35.800
Tyler: a bit easier to use or a bit of a better experience. Do you.

435
00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:36.460
> P4: Excel.

436
00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:42.190
Tyler: Do you use voice over when you're using my healthy vets messaging.

437
00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:43.660
> P4: I typically do.

438
00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:46.989
Tyler: and does that experience? Okay.

439
00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:51.020
> P4: I would say it works a little better than today, where it's a little less

440
00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:57.110
> P4: kind of choppy like. Oh, you clicked a button. Here is a button it. It does a better job of going to the text.

441
00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:58.880
Tyler: Okay, Gotcha.

442
00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:00.299
Tyler: that that makes sense.

443
00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:02.350
> P4: So not shocking.

444
00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:06.788
Tyler: Yeah, cool. Okay. And

445
00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:12.535
Tyler: I just wanna check if I have any other questions written down here.

446
00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:35.259
Tyler: I think we've talked about. Maybe some of the unexpected behavior that happened with your with voice over, like you were expecting that you would hover your mouse over text, and then it would read aloud, which wasn't what was happening. And then Maria kind of showed how we might use like keyboard navigation, and then that did read aloud, is there anything else besides that that felt like it was unexpected.

447
00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:39.079
> P4: No, that was the big one.

448
00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:41.619
> P4: That I can that jumped out to me.

449
00:41:41.970 --> 00:41:43.919
> P4: I can't remember anything else.

450
00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:53.210
Tyler: Okay. Awesome. Well, at this point, do you have any other questions for me about anything that we've we've talked about? Or we went through.

451
00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:54.970
> P4: Now. But

452
00:41:55.480 --> 00:42:01.959
> P4: I might go try and jump on the real Sva. See if I can maybe get that issue that I was trying to get figured out earlier.

453
00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:02.470
Tyler: Yes.

454
00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:04.450
> P4: Buttoned up after after years.

455
00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:27.382
Tyler: Yeah, well, it's quite different. And that's kind of what our team has been working on it. So I'll send you a link to it. In the chat. Just so you can have it in case you do want to have a look. But it's a different website. It's separate to va.gov and yeah, see how how you go with it, and maybe how the experience is different or or similar to what we just looked at together.

456
00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:38.130
Tyler: but awesome. I don't think I have any more questions. I appreciate you joining us today. I'm sorry that the time wasn't maybe communicated clearly. But it it worked out.

457
00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:39.930
> P4: Good. Yeah. It worked out.

458
00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:55.180
Tyler: Yeah, awesome. Well, I think that's all for me. Perigee. And the folks who set up this research session, they're going to send you a thank you. Note and some information that you can pass on to other veterans if they want to take part in research like this. But yeah, I hope you have a lovely rest of your day.

459
00:42:55.490 --> 00:42:57.050
> P4: All right. Thank you. You, too.

460
00:42:57.050 --> 00:42:58.459
Tyler: Thanks. [P4]. Bye.

461
00:42:58.460 --> 00:42:59.190
> P4: Thanks.
