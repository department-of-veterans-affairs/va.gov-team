### Warm up

Tyler: Awesome. So I just started the recording. And I just wanna confirm if you're comfortable, that I record my screen and audio today.

> P14: Yes, I am. Oh, I'm sorry. I just need to push the [button].

> P14: okay.

Tyler: No worries.

Tyler: awesome. Do you have any questions for me at this point?

> P14: Not really. No.

Tyler: Cool, alright. Well, before we get started with the website, I do just want to learn a little bit more about you and your experience with the VA.

Tyler: How long have you been a Veteran?

> P14: So I was an officer in the early 2 thousands.

> P14: and I actually went to medical school through the army, but I had to process out because [explains medical condition and how they've ended up with retina damage].

> P14: I can still see not legally blind yet, thankfully. But like it's getting to the point where I can't really drive anymore. And yeah, I'm just having a lot of like long distance kinds of problems, but also nearsightedness problems like, I just have like areas that are not great. So I use the screen magnifier definitely does help me.

Tyler: That's really helpful background, thank you. And how long have you been using the screen magnifier then?

> P14: for, like the past 5 years, it's been bad, but I don't know. I probably about the last 3 years.

Tyler: Okay, yeah, that makes sense. And how often would you say you use it when you're on your phone?

> P14: Sometimes that little screen that I have it up now because I was asked to use it. I don't have it up all the time honestly, because sometimes it gets annoying and I can still see. So I I know the general like, I know the layout, my phone. So just like a lot of blind people can adapt to like. They know the tables there. So

> P14: yeah, I can usually figure it out because I have a lot of apps, and they're arranged in a certain way where I know where they generally are. But I have a lot of apps. Let me explain that, like I. I can't emphasize that enough, because I actually have enough where I group them into groups.

> P14: So there's no way for me to see the apps themselves anymore, because they're really tiny icons now. So I have so many that I have, I don't know. Like 20 or so groups of apps. Each one of those has like

> P14: 5 to 10 apps in them. I've just a big app person. So so I have an iphone pro Max at this point, which has the larger screen. And it's got a lot of features for accessibility. So the so that's the main one that I use is just to like figure out like. So sometimes I have to just find something.

> P14: or I have to read the small print on something. But sometimes I just minimize it because it does get annoying to have that little like magnification screen.

> P14: So it really depends on what I'm doing. Like. If I'm gaming or something, then I definitely don't necessarily have that. But I can't play a lot of games that in

> P14: included like a lot of like visual acuity type things, you know.

Tyler: That makes sense. And so it's sort of like an overlay box on your screen,

> P14: Yeah.

Tyler: That you can use. Okay, cool. That's really helpful to better understand. And what browser do you tend to use on your phone?

> P14: I mean.

Tyler: Sorry.

> P14: Yeah, I tend to go with safari, like as an automated kind of thing.

> P14: because, you know, most websites will open a safari window, and they work with safari. But I also have chrome, because there are

> P14: some small features that chrome has. Also, if I remember, sometimes I open chrome, but it's usually for a specific reason, like, if I have to use auto fill, it doesn't always work on safari.

Tyler: that makes sense.

Tyler: and what about like when you're using VA websites do you, how often do you go on va.gov. For example.

> P14: Not a lot to be honest, I mean, maybe every one in 6 months. So like.

> P14: yeah, I'll just check certain benefits or something like that. I haven't had like I think I used it last like a year ago, where I was just like had to had to get records for something.

> P14: yeah, and that that you know. Cause I yeah, I don't. I don't use it heavily, honestly.

Tyler: Yeah, that's fine. Do you know, if you're using the VA app at all.

> P14: No, I don't think I have the app.

Tyler: Okay, gotcha. Okay, awesome. Well, we're gonna talk a little bit about a Va website today. But first, what we'll do is, we'll get you set up sharing your screen. Have you shared your screen on Zoom from your phone before? Okay.

Tyler: awesome. So when you're ready, you just go ahead and share your screen with me. And actually, what I'll do is I'm gonna actually just send you the link that we're gonna open up. I'm gonna send it in the chat on Zoom, so you can open that link when you're ready, and then we'll share your screen.

> P14: Okay.

> P14: just remember how to do this.

Tyler: Yeah, and let me know if you're if you're having any difficulty.

> P14: Yeah, I done it before. It's just I have to remember where to tap on the screen to do it

> P14: right.

> P14: It's a little different on the phone. I usually do the zoom

> P14: in the

> P14: in a laptop or something.

> P14: I wanna screen share right screen sharing screen.

Tyler: Yep, perfect.

> P14: Okay.

> P14: Okay.

> P14: Alright. It should go through soon.

Tyler: Okay, I'll let you know when I'm seeing it. Okay, perfect. So now I'm seeing your screen, it says you are sharing screen.

Tyler: And then from here, if you want to just tap yeah, the center of your phone, and then at the bottom of your screen, there's gonna be a chat.

> P14: Perfect, and we'll just click.

Tyler: That link.

> P14: Okay.

Tyler: Awesome.

Tyler: Okay. So from here it's up to you. If it's if you prefer to have my video there. You can keep it. If it's kind of annoying, and in the way you can just swipe it off. Yeah.

> P14: Yeah. That's what I did.

Tyler: Perfect. Alright. So we're gonna do one more thing before we're ready to start. So if you scroll down a little bit, there's gonna be a sign in box. So we've got one sign in box there, and then we're gonna scroll down a little bit further and it says, research study.

Tyler: So let's click on sign in or create an account that second sign in button.

> P14: Okay.

Tyler: Perfect.

### Dashboard

Tyler: Okay, awesome. So now we're all set up here. And I'm going to give you a little bit of context before we start. So we're gonna observe, as you navigate this website, website, this is a tool called, Ask VA.

Tyler: It's a way for Veterans to contact the Va and ask a question online.

Tyler: For today's session. We're just going to pretend, like you've recently asked the Va. A question.

Tyler: and today you've signed into your account on va.gov to read the reply from the Va

Tyler: and we're gonna go through a couple of different tasks, which I'll explain as we go. And as you're navigating, what's helpful for me to understand is one I can't see when you're magnifying or not, or what's bigger on your screen. So it's helpful for me to understand. Like, for example. Oh, I can't read this smaller text, and I would want to like, magnify. This. Things like that is really.

> P14: Oh, you can't! You can't see the magnifier box.

Tyler: That's right. Yeah. And that's not your fault or anything. It's just yes, sometimes with these like overlays. When you share your screen, they don't actually come through on our side. So that's not unexpected for me. But it is helpful if you just every once in a while you're like.

Tyler: I'm magnifying this. I can't read the smaller text, but I can read this bigger text if I if I'm not that that kind of thing.

> P14: I see. Okay. Oh, that's weird. But.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P14: Can see that part.

Tyler: Yeah, I know it would be nice if I could see it as well.

Tyler: So while you're focused on a task, I'm going to try and say quiet, but when you finish with the task we'll pause. We'll come back. We'll have a chat about how it went for you.

Tyler: And the only thing I'll ask is, while you're navigating around. If you want to click on a button or a link or something.

Tyler: Just let me know before you click on it. Okay.

> P14: Okay.

Tyler: Okay, awesome. So the the first.

> P14: Oh. Go ahead!

Tyler: Do you have any questions?

> P14: No, no, that was that was it.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So the 1st thing I'd like us to do is just to orient yourself on this page. So I'm gonna give you a couple of minutes, and you can navigate around this page. And afterwards I'd just like you to explain this page to me.

> P14: Okay, so this appears to be kind of like a tool for asking the Va questions about benefits.

> P14: and it sounds like they have a real person answering instead of AI. I'm not really sure but it, it has ways of filtering your questions. If you have a whole bunch and you have trouble finding them. So you can filter by newest to oldest you can filter by category, which

> P14: appears to be disability, a veteran card and etc, just like different types of questions, I guess.

> P14: or filter by status, which I guess means whether it's a

> P14: in progress replied or reopened.

> P14: So going down, it appears that I already have several questions.

> P14: The hypothetical person has hypothetical questions that are involving compensation, disability, compensation, and id card for a spouse

> P14: and dependence, information and technical issues, and probably a few more cause. There's a second page also, which I haven't done.

> P14: And you can check more details. But it appears one is in progress, one is reopened, and 2 are replied to. On this page.

Tyler: Awesome. That was really really helpful. I would love if you keep narrating like that through the session, because it's super helpful for me.

109
00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:27.040
Tyler: awesome. So we went through some questions. And it seems pretty clear what this page is is about. And you showed me kind of like how the filters work. One thing you just mentioned that was kind of interesting to me is these statuses. So you said, we've got like a question that's in progress. We have a question that's reopened.

110
00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:29.170
Tyler: What do those statuses mean?

111
00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:41.480
> P14: So like, I think, in progress means that you probably just submitted it. And you haven't gotten an answer to it yet.

112
00:12:41.884 --> 00:12:57.039
> P14: Replied is pretty self explanatory. I think it's probably just like you've gotten an answer to your question. I'm not sure what reopen means, because you're not actually I I mean, my understanding is that you only get information. You're not getting

113
00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:04.269
> P14: like like, it's not like you're filing something with the government so, or like file I I'm not sure like.

114
00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:04.690
Tyler: Yes.

115
00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:18.829
> P14: They actually give you claims through this. It sounds like you're just asking questions, right? So maybe reopened means you didn't get a satisfactory answer, and you want them to address your follow up questions. Maybe not sure.

116
00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:20.599
> P14: Reopen means.

117
00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:33.030
Tyler: Okay, awesome. That makes sense, so replied is really straightforward in progress. It seems like you got a good sense for, and then reopened is the only one where it's like. You have an idea what it might mean, but it's not as clear.

118
00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:36.390
> P14: Yeah, I'm not sure if I'm right. But.

119
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:41.269
Tyler: Awesome. Well, we'll we'll talk about that a little bit more in a moment. So

120
00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:50.519
Tyler: There's a couple questions on this page, and the next thing that I'd like you to do is to find a question that's related to home loans.

121
00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:51.770
> P14: Okay.

122
00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.480
> P14: Alright. So that's my only

123
00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:59.759
> P14: only information to look for. I'm gonna

124
00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:01.010
> P14: juice.

125
00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:07.210
> P14: Let me see, maybe housing assistance. I I went went to filter by category.

126
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.700
Tyler: So.

127
00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:13.120
> P14: Find it a little bit more easily, and I'm gonna select housing assistance and home loans.

128
00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.279
> P14: Because maybe that will

129
00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:18.530
> P14: that that was the assignment. What was it? Home loan.

130
00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:21.270
Tyler: Yeah. Yeah. A question about home loans.

131
00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:27.390
> P14: Okay? So yeah, so I think I found it. There was one submitted on April 24.th

132
00:14:28.296 --> 00:14:29.669
Tyler: Cool, okay.

133
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:31.379
> P14: Looks like it was replied to.

134
00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:40.879
Tyler: Okay, Gotcha. So that felt pretty straightforward to find. Obviously you were familiar with the filters because you had already explained them to me.

135
00:14:41.278 --> 00:14:44.740
Tyler: So it made sense the way that you decided to use them.

136
00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:53.470
Tyler: Besides using that filter. Is there any other way that you could find a question about home loans, if that's all you could remember about the question.

137
00:14:54.010 --> 00:15:13.449
> P14: Well, I could just before, when I I don't have to filter so I could just have all, and just scroll through every question and read what they're about. And there was a second page. So maybe it's on the second page. Yeah, I see it. It's on the second page. So I could.

138
00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:31.019
> P14: You know, it's not like this guy has like 3 million questions. He's just got like 2 pages of questions. So I I was able to find it by. You know they have the category written out also, and I guess that was the character category I selected before. When I asked the question.

139
00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:39.469
Tyler: Yeah, awesome. Okay? So you could use the category filter. But you also could just skim through the questions, especially

140
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.549
Tyler: because there's not a lot of questions right now. There's just.

141
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:42.870
> P14: Yeah.

142
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:44.149
Tyler: Couple of them. Yeah.

143
00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:53.750
Tyler: And you navigated to that second page without a problem. I know that you noticed it almost right away when you were explaining the page at the beginning to me.

144
00:15:54.424 --> 00:16:01.095
Tyler: Okay, awesome. Let's go ahead. And the next thing let's do is figure out.

145
00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:06.880
Tyler: Let's find a question that has a reply from the Va.

146
00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:10.869
Tyler: And I'd like for you to tell me how you figured out. It has a reply.

147
00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:18.510
> P14: Okay? So for that, I would select, replied.

148
00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:22.700
> P14: And that gives me

149
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:26.969
> P14: how many 3 appears to be. 3 of them are.

150
00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:27.330
Tyler: In the report.

151
00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:37.070
> P14: Category. We have one about sign in technical issues. And oh, 2 about sign in technical issues. And then the one with the housing.

152
00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:39.079
> P14: Oh, you're talking about. Just

153
00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.809
> P14: did just the housing one or.

154
00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:48.500
Tyler: No, that was perfect. What you did that makes a lot of sense. So you found the questions by using the filter, by status, right?

155
00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:49.120
> P14: Yes.

156
00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.069
Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. Okay.

157
00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:53.618
Tyler: do you have any questions about

158
00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:58.049
Tyler: about this page and how it works at this point.

159
00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:08.430
> P14: Well, I didn't know if reopened includes ones. I mean it. I guess it's its own category, but technically reopened. Maybe they have replies already, so

160
00:17:09.099 --> 00:17:11.949
> P14: you would just have to know in your own head that

161
00:17:11.959 --> 00:17:16.869
> P14: the the replies they there are ones that replied and reopened.

162
00:17:17.019 --> 00:17:19.299
> P14: I don't know. I mean. I guess

163
00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:28.919
> P14: I have no control over when they get replied to, but I would be the one to reopen something, so I guess I would already know that it was replied to so.

164
00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:29.340
Tyler: It might be a.

165
00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:29.920
> P14: Okay.

166
00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:31.060
Tyler: Okay.

167
00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:41.460
Tyler: that's a great point. So you obviously filtered for things that have been replied to. But you're also realizing that something that says reopened has probably also been replied to

168
00:17:41.903 --> 00:17:50.109
Tyler: and I can see how that maybe takes like a second more to think about or maybe not. Everyone would even notice it like you did.

169
00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:53.629
Tyler: okay, great. So

170
00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:59.469
Tyler: the next thing that I'd like us to do is find a question that you submitted on August 24.th

171
00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:07.189
> P14: Okay. So let's see. So August 24th of this year is not that old?

172
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:11.339
> P14: So I would probably go back to

173
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:19.140
> P14: all for the filter by status, so I could see all of them, and I would keep it on newest to oldest.

174
00:18:19.593 --> 00:18:22.419
> P14: That way. I could scroll through the date.

175
00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:25.090
> P14: And you said August 24, th right.

176
00:18:25.585 --> 00:18:26.080
Tyler: Yep.

177
00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.780
> P14: Yeah. So then I found this one about the veteran Id card.

178
00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:37.419
Tyler: Okay, awesome. So that was helpful. You knew that there was a filter already set, and you needed to change it to

179
00:18:37.817 --> 00:18:45.499
Tyler: like the default, where you could see all the questions, and then we didn't change anything else. We just skimmed for that that date right.

180
00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:46.630
> P14: Yeah.

181
00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:53.230
Tyler: Okay. Awesome. What's the difference between August 24, th and then it says, September 12.th Underneath that.

182
00:18:54.628 --> 00:19:13.669
> P14: Well, that's the last updated date, September 12.th So my own question was submitted on August 24.th So I would assume the updates happen when I get a reply. But I'm not really sure if they do anything else updating. But that's just kind of my assumption.

183
00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:15.860
Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

### Details page

Tyler: And we've talked a lot about these questions. But I'm curious, where would we find the answers for these questions? So if we wanted to know what the Va. Had said

185
00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:30.850
Tyler: in reply to this question about id cards, what would we do.

186
00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:33.189
> P14: So I will click details.

187
00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:33.530
Tyler: Okay.

188
00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:37.519
> P14: Details. I'm gonna do that now, right? Okay.

189
00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:46.710
> P14: So that takes you to another page where it has, like the whole conversation where it has my question at the top

190
00:19:46.740 --> 00:20:01.549
> P14: response from the Va. And then I guess I did a follow up response. And I'm gonna expand that so I could read what they were. So I I kind of pushed the the the banner or the plus thing.

191
00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:09.119
> P14: and I can see the original question is, how do I go about getting my spouse a Va. Card? Since I'm a veteran I already have mine.

192
00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:19.760
> P14: So the response is, Thank you for your inquiry. Blah blah, and then they they tell you how to do it. And then I had a follow up thing.

193
00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:26.109
> P14: I guess a follow up question. Does that mean? At some point it will be available for spouses of veterans.

194
00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:27.810
> P14: So

195
00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:33.299
> P14: yeah, I don't know if the follow up

196
00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:42.609
> P14: automatically is reopened, or will they know to check the follow up that that part's a little unclear to me.

197
00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:43.339
Tyler: Like I.

198
00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:54.540
> P14: I assume that if you can send a reply that somebody's gonna look at it again. That but I don't know at what point it becomes like a reop. Oh, I see it is a reopened

199
00:20:54.800 --> 00:21:04.010
> P14: okay, so it is in that reopen category. So I guess when you send a follow up, question it automatically reopens the case.

200
00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:12.840
Tyler: okay, awesome. Which was kind of your intuition earlier, even though you were like it's not super clear, but my guess is is that. Yeah.

201
00:21:13.204 --> 00:21:30.179
Tyler: that makes sense. And we, we've been testing this for about a week now, and we've found a lot of people are confused by the reopened status. So you've actually understood it more quickly than most people have. But I can see how it's not as clear as the.

202
00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:36.809
> P14: Yeah, it's not super clear, because the language with reopen when I think of reopened, I think of like formal claims.

203
00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:41.520
> P14: or like a case like for an investigation or something like that. So

204
00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:48.849
> P14: I I kinda get it. It makes sense. I don't know what else you would ask, or you will, you would label that as like a

205
00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:56.859
> P14: follow up or something like that? I don't know. Yeah, like, it's like a follow up question or something. So

206
00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:02.023
> P14: I I kinda get it. I don't. I don't know if there's language that would make that super clear.

207
00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:10.265
Tyler: Yeah, that that's fair, and and probably a a problem that we we are dealing with ourselves.

208
00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:17.069
Tyler: and so another thing that you were doing as you went through this page is, you very quickly found the conversation.

209
00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:32.199
Tyler: and you started to describe to me this is my question. This is the response from the Va. And then this is a follow up. Did you have any difficulty like identifying the Va's response, or anything in that conversation?

210
00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:39.779
> P14: No, not really. I'm kinda used to these kind of accordion type menus. Is that what they're called the.

211
00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:43.325
> P14: Where you can like, expand it.

212
00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:52.090
> P14: and I just yeah, it's it's clearly labeled your question response, your reply, and so on.

213
00:22:53.700 --> 00:23:01.159
> P14: so I didn't have a problem with that. I'm trying to think like I have elderly neighbors who are not used to technology at all.

214
00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:01.600
Tyler: Okay.

215
00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:07.980
> P14: If they would know to like press the thing. I think they would figure it out, too, because it's very easy to open it up.

216
00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:13.160
> P14: Like you just press it and it it expands, it.

217
00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:24.869
Tyler: yeah, that makes sense. Do you remember when you got to this page were they all open or closed, or, some of them were open, and some of them were closed.

218
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:29.859
> P14: I believe the 1st 2 were closed, and the last one was open. The most recent one was open.

219
00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:34.720
Tyler: okay, why do you think that one might be open.

220
00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:46.380
> P14: Because that's the most recent update. So you may not know about it yet. And if they there were many previous interactions you might not want to see them all.

221
00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:54.609
> P14: because I assume that you know what your own question was, and you probably have read the reply, because it's not the most recent anymore.

222
00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:56.620
Tyler: Gotcha, okay?

223
00:23:56.830 --> 00:24:02.080
Tyler: And we talked at the beginning, I can't see where your magnifier is on the page

224
00:24:02.507 --> 00:24:08.070
Tyler: is this a page where you would be relying on your magnification, and and

225
00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:10.570
Tyler: maybe for specific parts of the page.

226
00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:17.389
> P14: I actually don't have a big problem with the text here. I can read it. It's a little borderline.

227
00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:26.500
> P14: but the magnifying does help, for sure. Yeah, it it's I I like some of the white text

228
00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:27.365
> P14: is

229
00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:30.370
> P14: I can read it.

230
00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:38.419
> P14: I I think the smaller print for example, collapse all.

231
00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:42.360
> P14: Where it says collapse. All is a little bit borderline.

232
00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:43.040
Tyler: Yeah.

233
00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.910
> P14: Difficult. I just went at it.

234
00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:47.915
Tyler: Yeah, yeah, I can see, that's quite small. There.

235
00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:58.299
> P14: some of this. The numbers are a little harder sometimes, because I can figure out words, even if they're blurry. But if I have to

236
00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:03.339
> P14: find the reference number to write it down. I would use the magnifying glass for that

237
00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.270
> P14: and things.

238
00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:17.139
> P14: but beyond that, not yeah. It's not too bad, not too bad. I could probably figure it out without the magnifying glass, but I would like it for the details, like the numbers.

239
00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:20.030
Tyler: For sure. That makes sense.

240
00:25:20.463 --> 00:25:33.530
Tyler: Okay, awesome. And when we went through the conversation you noticed that there was a question, a response, and then there was some sort of follow up question that the veteran or you in this case had asked.

241
00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:42.129
Tyler: Let's say that, you know it'd been about a week, and you hadn't heard back from the Va.

242
00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:56.809
Tyler: And kind of like you said to me, You're like, is anyone going to answer this? Are people actually noticing that I did a follow up question. Let's say you wanted to reply back to the Va. And and check up on this. Can you show me how you would do that.

243
00:25:58.683 --> 00:26:05.479
> P14: Not really sure like. If I didn't get a response in a week I might bug them and write another reply.

244
00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:10.920
> P14: I mean, I guess if I really felt

245
00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:14.930
> P14: lack of confidence in this website, I would call the 1 800 number.

246
00:26:16.203 --> 00:26:20.690
> P14: I think, especially older people. They they don't always trust these Web

247
00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:28.360
> P14: feedback things. They would just call, I would say, older people like older than me. I'm not super young myself, and I.

248
00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:29.359
Tyler: I do like.

249
00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:41.472
> P14: Talking to a human sometimes. Also, if I don't have to be on hold a long time now, being on hold is really super annoying. So it depends on whether they they can answer in like a

250
00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:44.900
> P14: in a fast way.

251
00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:58.820
> P14: and I assume the feedback at the bottom. That button is more for website feedback. So I may not get a response about my direct Va question that way.

252
00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:09.809
> P14: So those are probably the 2 things I would do. I would send a reply. If I will wait a few more days, and if I didn't get a reply I would probably call the number.

253
00:27:10.139 --> 00:27:13.439
Tyler: Okay, that makes sense, that's really helpful to hear your

254
00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:18.609
Tyler: your rationale for like, why you might try and then why you might end up having to call.

255
00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:23.680
Tyler: and I think in a little bit I'll ask you a couple more questions about what make you what might make you

256
00:27:24.118 --> 00:27:30.221
Tyler: feel like it's been too long, or what make make you wanna call the Va. But

### Reply sent

Tyler: let's go ahead and send a reply to the Va. So you don't need to worry too much about what you write the Va. Right now. But let's pretend, like you're going to write them a message, and then you can send it when you feel ready.

258
00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:42.950
> P14: Okay.

259
00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:03.130
> P14: right? So I just wrote, did you get my last question?

260
00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:06.690
> P14: And it says it was submitted.

261
00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:15.370
> P14: So I you know again I got the message. You'll get a receive. A reply within 7 business days.

262
00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:21.789
> P14: And then I I hit the return button just to get me back to where I started.

### Cool down

Tyler: Okay, cool, and that will jump you all the way back to the beginning. And that's just because this is a prototype.

264
00:28:28.822 --> 00:28:40.967
Tyler: But that's good timing, because I think we've went through all the steps. That we wanted to look through together. So what we can do for the last like maybe 5 or to 10 min. We can just have a chat.

265
00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:48.608
Tyler: if you want to. Stop sharing your screen. There should be a button towards the top.

266
00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.010
> P14: Oh, right!

267
00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:53.778
Tyler: There you go, perfect.

Tyler: awesome. So we went through that pretty quickly, and I think you picked up on a lot of things that other folks have noticed. You also. It also seemed pretty straightforward for for someone like yourself.

269
00:29:06.401 --> 00:29:09.630
Tyler: How did you find that experience overall.

270
00:29:11.303 --> 00:29:13.720
> P14: Not bad. I I didn't

271
00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:18.869
> P14: browse through all the answers in that test, so I don't know what

272
00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:25.769
> P14: you know how how responsive they are, or how how detailed they are in their answers.

273
00:29:26.549 --> 00:29:32.260
> P14: But it it didn't seem too intimidating to me. But I'm

274
00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:44.399
> P14: like, you know, I'm not super young. But I use the I I'm on the Internet all the time. I'm a you know. I I'm a social media kind of person. So I'm used to kind of getting

275
00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:53.874
> P14: like navigating through different menus and things like searching Amazon for answers, searching Facebook for answers on my own.

276
00:29:54.440 --> 00:30:06.950
> P14: sometimes it can get a little frustrating when you're, you know. Like, if I have a problem with the optimum cable service or something I'm trying to like, ask them a question. I feel like I'm getting an AI answer, and it's not

277
00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:15.018
> P14: very specific to my my question. That gets a little annoying, because I feel like I'm getting a a

278
00:30:16.194 --> 00:30:31.170
> P14: what do you call it? Form letter, you know, in reply. And and it's not exactly what I'm asking. So I think I think in this case, too, like the the hypothetical veteran who asked the question

279
00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:39.240
> P14: just got like the website, like redirected the website. But he felt like he still wanted more information about, when is his wife going to

280
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:44.520
> P14: going to get the card? I mean, how is there a different process for his wife.

281
00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:58.460
> P14: So sometimes it can be a little frustrating, doing the follow up questions, especially when there's a like a week gap in between, or something. I understand it's the Va. They're. They're not going to be super

282
00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:06.699
> P14: fast responding. But if I've made a phone call and I got a human being, I could get that answer right away like the same day.

283
00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:18.720
> P14: So. So that's kind of where I'm at. I mean, it depends on how patient you are. Some of these older veterans might be more patient than I am. I don't know, because they just they're retired, and

284
00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:43.730
> P14: for me, I'm like, I'm just asking a simple question. You know. I don't know if I always wanna wait on an answer for like a week, and then they don't answer it right? So it's another week. Wait! Actually, I didn't see the exact dates. I don't know if it was a week, but it was a couple of days for sure. And that's a little frustrating. You get used to customer service that you just wanna hear from right away.

285
00:31:44.232 --> 00:31:55.520
> P14: Again. The Va is different because it's a government organization. I don't. I don't. I don't have an expectation that they're they're ever gonna answer fast. It's like calling the Irs or something.

286
00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:59.389
> P14: But yeah, I I think

287
00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:09.360
> P14: it's it's it's nice. It's like an extra service. So if I had something that was more pressing, I think I would use the phone number rather than ask Va.

288
00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:15.299
Tyler: Okay, yeah, that's really helpful. So you're balancing a lot of different things like, one is like.

289
00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:26.299
Tyler: Am I getting getting an answer quickly? Will the answer be really specific? Will it be the actual answer I need for my question? And it's interesting. You brought up?

290
00:32:26.664 --> 00:32:32.180
Tyler: Ai, because that's kind of maybe a 3rd scenario we've got like calling somebody on the phone.

291
00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:40.939
Tyler: maybe asking like some sort of bot or AI your question. And then sort of what we looked at to together today.

292
00:32:42.570 --> 00:32:56.220
Tyler: Do you think that there's a scenario where you might use something like the and the it's a totally fine if the answer is no where. You might use something like this tool where you're waiting about 7 days, 7 business days to get a reply from the Va.

293
00:32:59.590 --> 00:33:04.030
> P14: like where I'm willing to wait 7 days to get my reply.

294
00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:14.469
> P14: for me. I don't really like that. I don't know. I think, cause I'm kind of a self starter with websites. If I

295
00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:24.530
> P14: I I think that there's other ways. I if I need an answer to a basic question like, what part of the va.gov website? Do I?

296
00:33:25.097 --> 00:33:31.779
> P14: Fine form 5 0, 1, whatever. I I would end up googling it 1st

297
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:43.774
> P14: and exploring the site first.st Maybe there's like a FAQ or something like there's usually a site directly on the website. I mean the the there's like a FAQ, or there's a

298
00:33:44.528 --> 00:33:46.120
> P14: like a search bar or.

299
00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:46.489
Tyler: From there.

300
00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:49.189
> P14: Like that where I could search for that directly.

301
00:33:49.350 --> 00:34:04.269
> P14: and I wouldn't ask generic questions. And then specific questions I usually, you know, like, for example, like I, I want to open the I want to apply for new Id card. I wouldn't expect to ask Va. To do that for.

302
00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:05.080
Tyler: For me.

303
00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:12.249
> P14: They're they're just like the question. Answer. So for me, I don't know how much I would utilize that I I

304
00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:40.869
> P14: maybe I would use it as one of my resources, but I usually want to know the answer right away, and I know other ways of doing that. I mean, I could even join a Facebook group for veterans, and just like, ask a real person who has gone through it like an actual veteran. Or I could go on Reddit and find like a sub where I could get that answer much quicker, or I could search the past questions. Somebody else must have asked that, and quora, or something like that. And I can Google it.

305
00:34:41.524 --> 00:34:42.139
> P14: So

306
00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:43.719
> P14: I feel like

307
00:34:44.635 --> 00:35:01.389
> P14: i'm a little bit more tech Savvy with that and I can I can figure out other ways. I think for some older veterans. This might be okay, but I feel like it is quite a long time to wait for generic answer. If it was something specific, like.

308
00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:12.859
> P14: what years of service did I blah? What year did I get this discharge paperwork or something like that then. Maybe I don't know, like

309
00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:39.580
> P14: not sure like I feel like there are other ways of finding that out like directly I and I I think there's like a privacy matter, too, like when they like. I couldn't, you know, I shouldn't be able to search for something like that on a generic website like, ask Va, because I'm supposed to put in my private service info before they'll give it back to me. So I don't know how much this website would really help me

310
00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:48.160
> P14: if it's a 1 year. Sorry one year, one week. Reply. It's kind of excessive for me.

311
00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:50.420
Tyler: oh, yeah.

312
00:35:50.420 --> 00:36:01.850
> P14: Even a few days reply. But I like that. It's a resource like it's not hurting me any, and it's it's like, you know. It might help some elderly people who don't want to wait on the phone.

313
00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:12.390
Tyler: yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And I think you showed a lot of examples of other tools, you you could use before you got to the point of wanting to use something like this.

314
00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:27.179
Tyler: and you made a really good distinction between these sort of more general questions. And then more specific questions, and for the general questions, it feels like there's a whole lot of options before you would get to the point of using a tool like, ask Va

315
00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:29.560
Tyler: for the specific questions

316
00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:42.280
Tyler: I know you mentioned. Like you could talk to other veterans on a Facebook group. You might call the Va on the phone to get answers like, Oh, you know which dates of service or things like that?

317
00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:53.000
Tyler: what might make you use a tool like? Ask Va to ask a specific question like what might need to change about the tool.

318
00:36:54.702 --> 00:37:03.149
> P14: I'm just trying to think of scenarios where I would be even asking specific questions that would not be searchable in the other ways.

319
00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:08.599
> P14: I guess. I mean, I guess that kind of answers your question if I couldn't find it other ways.

320
00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:19.420
> P14: but also the like. There's kind of like 3 categories. In my mind, there's like very general questions which, like, what part of the website do I go on to file a claim? Blah blah?

321
00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:28.520
> P14: There's more like specific questions like, if I had service in 2,021, would I

322
00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:34.340
> P14: qualify for? I don't know some Gulf war, whatever benefit

323
00:37:34.839 --> 00:37:44.739
> P14: so that's pretty specific. But then there's also even more specific, which is to my service, which requires my personal private info

324
00:37:45.227 --> 00:37:52.309
> P14: which would require, I guess, some kind of like privacy encoding or whatever that they have, and I don't feel like

325
00:37:52.320 --> 00:38:12.469
> P14: the 3rd option is associated with. Ask Va. I think you'd have to go to the actual Va website and put your your info on if they could connect it somehow. I I don't know that to be a fact, but it just seems like it would make sense. I don't know that it seems like it would be more secure, securely locked down

326
00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:14.420
> P14: so if it could.

327
00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:22.220
> P14: if if it could be like, you know, we will find this actual claim and like, open it for you. And like, do all that stuff.

328
00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:30.669
> P14: Yeah, just give us your information and we will encrypt it and all that stuff. Then, yeah, maybe I would.

329
00:38:31.006 --> 00:38:36.560
> P14: Yeah. Then I definitely would probably use it for for some of the stuff like finding paperwork.

330
00:38:36.855 --> 00:38:56.919
Tyler: Okay, that's really helpful. I can see those 3 buckets and it's helpful to know that like in that situation where it is more personal question. Is, you would need to like, have more reassurance that it's secure. It's encrypted. It's a place where, like people from the Va are gonna be able to respond to you and look at your case and things like that.

331
00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:58.380
Tyler: Yeah.

332
00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:02.100
> P14: I mean, we have to log in. I assume right? We skip that.

333
00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:02.970
Tyler: Okay.

334
00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:06.470
> P14: But but I I'm sure we had to. We had to log in, but.

335
00:39:07.242 --> 00:39:12.989
> P14: I believe there were like several logins when I had to file claims and dual that it was like

336
00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:21.940
> P14: more than that I I had to prove that that was my Id. That was, you know, there was like a lot of like identification verification steps. So

337
00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:26.243
> P14: I'm not sure if Va. Asked Va. Is that? But I suspect that it's not

338
00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:30.040
> P14: not connected in that way to the general. Va.

339
00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:36.540
Tyler: Yeah. And why do you think it's not connected to the general Va, like, what makes what gives you that sense.

340
00:39:36.990 --> 00:39:46.919
> P14: Not really sure, but just like the level of questions that we're being asked. It just seems like a more generic QA. Type website.

341
00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:54.929
> P14: But also, I mean, this is just the test. So it's probably not. Everything is realistic, but like it would.

342
00:39:55.850 --> 00:39:57.933
> P14: I don't know. Like the

343
00:39:58.390 --> 00:40:02.750
> P14: like for the secure login. I guess they would probably

344
00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:15.880
> P14: like the 1st time you apply, which we didn't go through, you know, and I haven't used this, so I don't really know, but the 1st time they would have to verify your Id and go through a lot whole process before they let you

345
00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:21.890
> P14: looking. It's like, like the medical insurance websites and everything. They're not just gonna

346
00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:28.950
> P14: randomly give out your like just because you put in a password. They usually want to verify it several ways.

347
00:40:29.838 --> 00:40:49.361
Tyler: Yeah, okay, that makes sense. So you would expect a couple of like hoops and like things where you're showing like this is my Id, and things like that before you got to the point of being like, okay, now I'm in. It's a secure website. I can chat to the Va about something. And when we obviously skipped over or we didn't do a lot of that today.

348
00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:50.873
> P14: So I guess it is.

349
00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:52.650
Tyler: Or or no, I just mean like.

350
00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:52.970
> P14: Awesome.

351
00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:54.679
Tyler: That's sort of where you're coming from.

352
00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:55.440
> P14: Yeah.

353
00:40:55.780 --> 00:41:01.260
Tyler: Yeah. And like, I'll give you a little bit of context like on how this tool kind of works. Right now.

354
00:41:01.921 --> 00:41:09.719
Tyler: There's different ways you can use. Ask Va, you can just not sign in, and you can ask a pretty general question to the Va

355
00:41:10.032 --> 00:41:16.539
Tyler: or you can sign into your account, and then, in which case you could ask more specific questions because it is then secure.

356
00:41:17.033 --> 00:41:24.559
Tyler: That being said that doesn't change the waiting time, or any of the other issues that you've brought up with with the tool?

357
00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:26.030
Tyler: So

358
00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:47.849
Tyler: I do. We have a couple of minutes. I just wanna quickly check in about how you were using magnification during the session and whether it was like easy to read things and things like that. So we talked about how like the collapse, all button was quite small, and that text was harder to read. Did you have any other issues using your magnifier during the session?

359
00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:59.889
> P14: Not really. I mean, there's just anytime. There's a lot of text you have to kinda like, move it around the screen. That gets a little annoying because it's like just another thing, it interrupts the text.

360
00:42:00.294 --> 00:42:08.530
> P14: But I wouldn't say it's any different from any other website in that way, especially a government website is is going to be a lot of text and

361
00:42:09.086 --> 00:42:21.500
> P14: it wasn't really confusing to me. I think I the only time I was really depending on. It was for the the number the the claim number, what it was sorry, not claim, but the

362
00:42:21.570 --> 00:42:25.134
> P14: inquiry number, whatever it was that that number is

363
00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:44.079
> P14: I just, you know, like, if I wanted to write that down I would have to use the text magnifier. The other stuff I could kind of squint my way through. And it was at that level for me, I mean for someone with worse eyesight. They probably would have more problems. But for me it was okay.

364
00:42:44.250 --> 00:43:02.660
Tyler: Yeah, okay, great, yeah. And just for your own peace of mind, we're testing with different veterans who use different types of assistive technology or have different levels of vision. So it's helpful to hear from your perspective that like, for the most part, it's it's everything's working as you expected. With your magnifier?

365
00:43:02.912 --> 00:43:08.970
Tyler: I think you've answered all my questions. I do want to give you a moment to ask me any questions. If you have any.

366
00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:12.000
> P14: Not really

367
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:22.169
> P14: no, I mean, you're just trying to trying to make it more accessible to like all different veterans, including ones with bad eyesight. I guess.

368
00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:29.139
Tyler: Yes, right now, ask, Va is actually separate to va.gov, it's like another website. And it's not.

369
00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:29.400
> P14: Right.

370
00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:38.720
Tyler: Very accessible for people who use assistive technology. And so we're moving it to va.gov, and while we do that, we're making sure that it is accessible.

371
00:43:38.981 --> 00:43:46.279
Tyler: And so that's kind of what we're doing this week. We're not always testing with just people who use assistive technology. But right now, that's what our focus is.

372
00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:56.620
> P14: I see? I see. Yeah, no. So that would be interesting. Are they going to be able to have more functions when they're integrated into the main va.gov.

373
00:43:57.130 --> 00:44:11.999
Tyler: Well, that's a good question. And I think part of what we're trying to understand is how well this tool will work for veterans, or how well it has in the past. And maybe what the future of the tool might might be like. Depending on, like, what people are

374
00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:24.561
Tyler: finding useful or frustrating, or a lot of what we talked about today. So you know, maybe a quicker response. Time is really important. Or maybe making sure that it's secure is really important.

375
00:44:25.070 --> 00:44:30.189
Tyler: or it's yeah. There's some other version of this in the future.

376
00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:44.039
> P14: Okay, I mean, I it's good to know that it's it's there. I mean, I think more information is always better. Even if I don't access that tool. I I think it's nice to have options.

377
00:44:44.661 --> 00:44:47.188
> P14: To to know that it's there.

378
00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:55.069
> P14: I mean, it's it's possible I could have that need one day. I I just haven't so far, so.

379
00:44:55.220 --> 00:45:06.489
Tyler: Yeah, that's fair. And just for your awareness right now the tool, like I said, it's not on va.gov, but in the the nearest future. It'll be on va.gov, so I don't want you to go searching around for it, and.

380
00:45:06.490 --> 00:45:07.090
> P14: Yeah, yeah.

381
00:45:07.090 --> 00:45:28.229
Tyler: Yeah, cool, awesome. Okay? Well, that's everything for us today. Thank you so much for for spending the hour with us. It was really helpful. If you have any questions the folks who set up the research session from Perigean, they will send you a thank you note, and you can reach out to them and otherwise. I hope you have a lovely rest of your day.

382
00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:30.000
> P14: Okay, thank you so much.

383
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.329
Tyler: Thank you. Bye.

384
00:45:31.330 --> 00:45:32.990
> P14: Have a great day bye, bye.
