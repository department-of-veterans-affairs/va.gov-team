### Warm up

Tyler: Alright. So I just want to confirm now that I started the recording. Are you comfortable? If I record my screen and audio today.

> P8: Yes.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: awesome. So we've met a lot of people. And I just gave you a lot of information. Do you have any questions for me?

> P8: None right now.

Tyler: Okay, well, before we get started testing the website, I do want to just learn a little bit more about you and your experience with the Va. I'm curious. How long have you been a veteran?

> P8: I got out in [2000's].

8
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.920
Tyler: Okay.

9
00:00:35.583 --> 00:00:40.050
Tyler: so have you been interacting with the Va for about 20 years? Then.

10
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.629
> P8: Yeah, both here and

11
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.620
> P8: [location] and [location].

12
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.360
Tyler: Okay, gotcha.

13
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:55.429
Tyler: And these days, what are your interactions with the Va, what does that look like? How often are you interacting with the Va. And for what?

14
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.760
> P8: Absolutely.

15
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.390
Tyler: Things.

16
00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.870
> P8: I go. Maybe

17
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.683
> P8: I have an appointment usually once every 2 months, maybe more, depending on.

18
00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.310
> P8: If it's for my eyesight or hearing

19
00:01:08.255 --> 00:01:09.890
> P8: or back issues.

20
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.440
Tyler: Okay.

21
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.759
Tyler: and it's mostly to do with healthcare.

22
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:14.490
> P8: Yes.

23
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.270
Tyler: Okay, Gotcha, how do you get in touch with with the Va. And that might be getting in touch with your doctors.

24
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.119
> P8: Because here in [location] it's a little different. They use.

25
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.750
> P8: they go through [location].

26
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.399
> P8: So when calling, trying to call the [location] offices.

27
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.800
> P8: It redirects to [location]

28
00:01:37.817 --> 00:01:43.922
> P8: which I don't like because I have to call down there. Then wait. So usually I just send a secure message through

29
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.810
> P8: the va.gov.

30
00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:46.770
> P8: Okay?

31
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.259
Tyler: How have you found secure, messaging.

32
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.100
> P8: I like it.

33
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.497
> P8: Usually they respond within

34
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.840
> P8: a certain amount of time, and I don't have to wait that long.

35
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.470
Tyler: so the the response time is pretty quick. Is there anything else? You like about it.

36
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.219
> P8: it pretty much has everything I need. I can check my disability

37
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.712
> P8: ratings in my

38
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.570
> P8: payment, too.

39
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:16.530
Tyler: Okay.

40
00:02:17.921 --> 00:02:22.860
Tyler: and you're checking your disability ratings in your payment through secure messaging.

41
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.140
> P8: No, not through secure messaging. No! Through the Va.

42
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.989
Tyler: Okay, Gotcha. So on another part of va.gov.

43
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.640
> P8: Yeah.

44
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.730
> P8: Do you ever go?

45
00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:39.760
Tyler: Across a situation where you want to get in touch with the Va. Like you need to speak to someone, or you have a question. But it's not related to your healthcare.

46
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.619
> P8: I'll look at Va.gov, to see who I need to talk to or where I can email them.

47
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:49.490
Tyler: Okay.

48
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.470
Tyler: cool.

49
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:57.430
Tyler: Do you generally have a preference between emailing or chatting or a phone call.

50
00:02:58.965 --> 00:03:01.489
> P8: I prefer phone calls, but

51
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:12.029
> P8: with the way that the it's set up you'd have to go through a bunch of hoops. So I'd rather just have them call me when it's convenient for them.

52
00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.950
Tyler: Okay?

53
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.029
Tyler: And what do you think makes you prefer a phone call.

54
00:03:16.955 --> 00:03:28.339
> P8: Just to be able to to hear the person and just to make sure things are clear rather than wait through email to for the situation to resolve. Going back and forth.

55
00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.240
Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

56
00:03:31.046 --> 00:03:39.180
Tyler: And it sounds like you have had some difficulty with the phone in terms of like not being able to get in touch with someone directly, or getting bounced around a little bit.

57
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.269
> P8: Yeah, or getting sent to the wrong department.

58
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.920
Tyler: Okay.

59
00:03:43.927 --> 00:03:46.599
Tyler: Have you ever heard of something called? Ask Va.

60
00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.600
> P8: I don't think so. No.

61
00:03:50.600 --> 00:04:06.679
Tyler: Okay, that's not a problem. We're gonna talk more about that in a little bit. Before we do that, I do want to learn a little bit more about how you're using your assistive technology. So we talked about how you're using dragon but you're newer to using it. Remind me how long you've been using it for.

62
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.620
> P8: About.

63
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.056
> P8: I'd say about a month. I use it to dictate my

64
00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.570
> P8: clinical notes and then just paste them into the

65
00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:18.499
> P8: program that we use.

66
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:25.050
Tyler: Okay, Gotcha. So you're using it for dictation. Is there a reason that you like using it for dictation?

67
00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:27.490
> P8: It

68
00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.050
> P8: goes a lot. I can talk a lot faster than I can type.

69
00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:37.700
> P8: And I know there's other features in there like opening commands. It's just I'm trying to figure that out because my eyesight

70
00:04:38.253 --> 00:04:39.919
> P8: it's getting a little worse.

71
00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.749
> P8: So it's kind of hard to read the letters. And I don't want I have

72
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.749
> P8: on my work computer. I have too many icons. So.

73
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.340
> P8: Hard to blow it up.

74
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:58.629
Tyler: Gotcha. Okay? So you're so far, your experience with dragon is really just using it to dictate

75
00:04:59.327 --> 00:05:04.589
Tyler: and then it'll type up the text for you. You haven't really used it for like navigation, for example.

76
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.460
> P8: Not yet.

77
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:07.150
Tyler: Okay.

78
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.950
Tyler: Gotcha.

79
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.359
> P8: Trying to figure that out.

80
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.420
Tyler: Okay?

81
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:11.375
Tyler: Well,

82
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:27.499
Tyler: let's see today what makes sense. It might be the case that you end up not using dragon very much in the session. We'll just see how we go with that. And that's okay. And what device are you on today? It looks like you're on like a desktop, or a laptop, or something.

83
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.280
> P8: Laptop.

84
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.770
Tyler: Okay? And is that is it a Mac? Or is it a web?

85
00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.719
> P8: I hate Macs window.

86
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.559
Tyler: Okay, cool.

87
00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.020
Tyler: awesome. And which browser do you usually prefer.

88
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.870
> P8: From.

89
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.560
Tyler: Okay, cool.

90
00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.839
Tyler: I just want to check and see if Sara has any other questions before we continue.

91
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.150
Sara: I do not.

92
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:52.390
Tyler: Okay.

93
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:53.410
Tyler: awesome.

94
00:05:54.674 --> 00:06:00.979
Tyler: So the next thing that we want to do is set you up sharing your screen. [P8], have you ever done that before?

95
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:01.610
> P8: Yeah.

96
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:09.312
Tyler: Okay. So I'm just gonna give you a minute to share your screen and while you do that, I'm gonna send over a a link to

97
00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.680
Tyler: the website we're going to look at together.

98
00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:12.630
> P8: Alright!

99
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:18.740
Tyler: So I just sent a website in the chat on Zoom.

100
00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.910
Tyler: okay, perfect.

101
00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:46.889
Tyler: So what we're going to do now is just scroll down, and there's going to be a heading that says research study. And then we're just going to click on that button. Perfect.

102
00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.389
Tyler: Okay, cool. So we're all set up now.

103
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:51.040
> P8: I mean.

104
00:06:52.200 --> 00:07:00.230
Tyler: I'm going to tell you a little bit more about what we're doing and give you some context before we get started. I do want to just check if you have any questions for me. At this point.

105
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.689
> P8: None right now.

106
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:02.210
Tyler: Okay.

### Dashboard

Tyler: alright. So we've just opened up. Ask Va, and I'm gonna tell you a little bit more about this now. So this is a tool that veterans can use to contact the Va and ask a question online. For today's session. We're going to pretend like you've recently asked the Va. A question, and today you've signed into your account on Va. Gov. And you're here because you want to read the reply to your question.

108
00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:28.600
> P8: Okay.

109
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:33.239
Tyler: And so we're gonna go through a couple of different tasks, which I'm going to explain as we go.

110
00:07:33.868 --> 00:07:39.310
Tyler: And as you're navigating, I'd like to understand what's going through your mind, and

111
00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:56.370
Tyler: how you might use assistive technology or not use it to support you. So, for example, if you decide to turn on dragon? Why, you've decided to use it, and then we'll kind of observe as you're using it. Maybe it'll be the case that you're not using it today.

112
00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:58.960
Tyler: or yeah, anything like that.

113
00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:11.167
Tyler: it will be helpful for me. I'm gonna try and stay quiet while you're working on a task. But if you can pause every once in a while, and then we can chat about what you just did. That that'd be great

114
00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.929
Tyler: Do you have any questions about that?

115
00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.370
> P8: None right now.

116
00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:35.399
Tyler: Okay, great. So let's get started. I just want to reiterate that instead of making you sign in today, we're just pretending that you've signed in, and this is your account. And so you've arrived at. Ask Va. The 1st thing I'd like you to do is orient yourself on this page. So I'm gonna give you a couple of minutes to navigate around

117
00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:46.779
Tyler: while you're navigating, I will just ask that if there's something you want to click on. Maybe just let me know before you click on it, and after you finish I'll ask you to explain this page to me.

118
00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.760
> P8: And I'm done. Alex.

119
00:08:51.655 --> 00:08:52.550
Tyler: Okay.

120
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:56.100
Tyler: okay, so what's what information is available on this page.

121
00:08:57.867 --> 00:08:58.790
> P8: Looks like it

122
00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.040
> P8: has

123
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:08.360
> P8: previous questions that the veteran may have asked. Looks like several that there's another

124
00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:12.580
> P8: box to click on to go to the next one.

125
00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:21.260
> P8: assumed. If it's like, ask the aid, maybe like AI. But

126
00:09:21.921 --> 00:09:25.170
> P8: it looks like it'll send information.

127
00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:26.810
> P8: And then

128
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:30.730
> P8: you have to wait 7 days, which it may be easier

129
00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:36.250
> P8: for me just to call the 800 number and hopefully get an answer

130
00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:38.399
> P8: before the 7 days.

131
00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:43.129
Tyler: okay, cool. So ask, Va, you said

132
00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:49.889
Tyler: your 1st assumption that it was that it might use AI and that's just that's kind of just from the title of it. Is that right.

133
00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:52.639
> P8: Yeah, just the

134
00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:54.640
> P8: yeah. Me, assuming.

135
00:09:54.790 --> 00:10:00.880
Tyler: Okay, that makes sense. What if it was using AI? How might you feel differently about it?

136
00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:06.560
> P8: If it was AI. Hopefully, you'd have more

137
00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:11.119
> P8: quicker answers than receiving a reply. Within 7 days.

138
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:11.800
Tyler: Okay.

139
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:18.230
Tyler: yeah. So maybe it would be a positive thing, because you would assume that the answer would come more quickly.

140
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:19.060
> P8: Yes.

141
00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:27.240
Tyler: Okay, that makes sense. And you also mentioned that if you notice that it would take 7 business days, you probably would just end up calling.

142
00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:30.400
> P8: Yes. Well, depending on

143
00:10:31.257 --> 00:10:32.689
> P8: what I needed.

144
00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:33.760
Tyler: Okay.

145
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:36.730
Tyler: what do you think might

146
00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:43.620
Tyler: make you decide to call and what might make you decide to to submit a question and wait 7 business days.

147
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:45.929
Tyler: You can think of a scenario. Maybe.

148
00:10:46.335 --> 00:10:50.394
> P8: Well, just like with disability compensation. I know I've called.

149
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:51.665
> P8: or

150
00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:53.760
> P8: To

151
00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:54.935
> P8: ask

152
00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:03.959
> P8: when the last time someone actually touched the file cause that tells me if someone is actually working on the file.

153
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.810
> P8: and

154
00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:11.809
> P8: the system I know usually won't say that it'll just say

155
00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.899
> P8: in stage

156
00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:15.480
> P8: whatever.

157
00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:24.269
> P8: Decision or gathering stage. It really doesn't tell me if someone's actually actively working on it, which

158
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:28.739
> P8: to me and to some other veterans. I know we

159
00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:31.040
> P8: we like to know if someone's actually

160
00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.419
> P8: working on it doing it.

161
00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:37.529
Tyler: that makes sense. So if your question had to do with like.

162
00:11:37.947 --> 00:11:44.610
Tyler: how far along something was or what's happening with it, then you feel like calling would give you more specific information.

163
00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:50.066
> P8: Yeah, because they can look up in the system to see if someone touched the file that day.

164
00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:51.020
Tyler: Okay.

165
00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:55.239
Tyler: yeah, that makes sense. What kind of question would you ask?

166
00:11:55.742 --> 00:12:05.720
Tyler: You know, if any through this tool? So it's going to take 7 business days, and it's going to be submitted online rather than calling on the phone.

167
00:12:07.183 --> 00:12:13.159
> P8: If it was disability I'd be like, what is the projected

168
00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.240
> P8: eta of my claim?

169
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:17.330
Tyler: Okay.

170
00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.629
Tyler: so something that will give you sort of a

171
00:12:22.069 --> 00:12:23.409
Tyler: maybe a

172
00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:27.880
Tyler: clear answer. But it also is not something you need right away. It's not as urgent.

173
00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:29.230
> P8: Yeah.

174
00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:29.910
Tyler: Okay.

175
00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:33.520
> P8: And for

176
00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.919
> P8: veteran Id

177
00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:42.510
> P8: that I know I can go through the Va.

178
00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:48.869
> P8: And most veterans know they can't get one for their spouse unless they're

179
00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.910
> P8: higher rating. I think.

180
00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.280
Tyler: Okay.

181
00:12:54.060 --> 00:13:03.199
Tyler: So you've already picked up on like, there might be certain things here where you wouldn't use this. You would just search or look on Va. Gov. To find the information.

182
00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:07.070
> P8: To. Yeah, this schedule to get my

183
00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:10.730
> P8: Id, or I just go to the next visit at the.

184
00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:11.500
Tyler: Okay.

185
00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:14.349
> P8: Va. Office. But I think

186
00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:19.260
> P8: you have to go down to an actual hospital. Not one

187
00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.730
> P8: site locations.

188
00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:22.820
Tyler: Okay, Gotcha.

189
00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:36.649
Tyler: And when we talked about we were talking about the phone. And then we talked about ask Va, and we also talked about like this version. That would be, you know, hypothetically using AI. What kind of scenario might that be useful for.

190
00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:41.520
> P8: finding out.

191
00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:45.403
> P8: probably like

192
00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:52.910
> P8: hours, or how to get in touch with a certain doctor, maybe, or

193
00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:53.785
> P8: find

194
00:13:55.370 --> 00:14:02.280
> P8: When I 1st moved here. I had to use Va. Gov to find certain providers because I was coming from

195
00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:05.229
> P8: [location]. So I was trying to look at

196
00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:08.070
> P8: different va hospitals that

197
00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.779
> P8: did both Audiology

198
00:14:13.293 --> 00:14:18.799
> P8: if they had a chiropractor stuff like that to find out which one encompasses

199
00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:19.860
> P8: all those.

200
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:23.010
Tyler: Okay, gotcha. So

201
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:36.100
Tyler: it kind of feels like it's like, maybe like location, specific information or information. That's it's not like as general as like, hey, can veterans get this benefit? It's more specific to you.

202
00:14:36.422 --> 00:14:42.769
Tyler: But not necessarily something you'd be like want to call about. Or maybe you need contact information, something like that. Okay.

203
00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:51.039
Tyler: okay, that's helpful. I know it's a little hard to think of the scenarios on the spot, but it does give me an idea of how you're thinking about these different tools.

204
00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:58.100
Tyler: is there anything else you noticed on this page? You said that this had past questions.

205
00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:05.849
> P8: Yeah, the past questions here for sign in and technical issues. If they can't sign in, then they're not going to be able to get into this part.

206
00:15:06.221 --> 00:15:08.080
Tyler: Yup, that's a great point.

207
00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:13.349
Tyler: I think that makes a lot of sense

208
00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:16.589
Tyler: anything else on.

209
00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:21.474
> P8: Unless unless the ask Va. Can send it directly to like another outside

210
00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:23.390
> P8: email source.

211
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:26.110
Tyler: yeah.

212
00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:32.380
> P8: Well, this one's

213
00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:35.110
> P8: directly with the Va. App, so.

214
00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:36.440
Tyler: Okay.

215
00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:38.370
> P8: And

216
00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:43.200
> P8: that one doesn't really have anything to do with signing.

217
00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:47.860
> P8: Because it has to do with finding out information about dependents.

218
00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:51.379
Tyler: so it feels like it's maybe not

219
00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.499
Tyler: the right category.

220
00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:54.900
> P8: Yeah, maybe

221
00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:57.870
> P8: questions and answers early.

222
00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.740
> P8: I don't know. Maybe dependents.

223
00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:06.120
Tyler: Yeah.

224
00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.660
> P8: What all categories there are.

225
00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:09.680
Tyler: Yeah, for sure.

226
00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:10.949
Tyler: But I can see that.

227
00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:16.969
> P8: But the other one. Yeah, I guess you could group it into sign in and technical issues if it's dealing with the

228
00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:19.349
> P8: one of the services, like the Va app.

229
00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:20.270
Tyler: Okay.

230
00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:32.006
Tyler: yeah. I mean, it's a great point. If you had asked a question about like I'm not able to sign in, can you help me, you wouldn't be able to sign in to see that here. Which totally makes sense.

231
00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:35.800
Tyler: okay, great. So

232
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:43.370
Tyler: there's obviously a few questions on this page, and I. The next thing I want you to do is find a question that has a reply from the Va.

233
00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.950
> P8: I'd open up the filter and hit reply.

234
00:16:56.185 --> 00:17:03.299
> P8: The subtitles are there, too. I didn't see that. Notice that. Okay. So the bottom ones have replied on them.

235
00:17:06.004 --> 00:17:15.999
Tyler: Awesome. So you used the filter. You found that pretty quickly, and that showed you. Which questions have a reply. What made you jump up to the filter.

236
00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:19.260
> P8: I really wasn't

237
00:17:19.869 --> 00:17:24.710
> P8: reading that part. So I saw the filter status. So I just clicked on.

238
00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:25.560
Tyler: Yeah.

239
00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:26.439
> P8: You see.

240
00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:29.799
Tyler: Go ahead!

241
00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:32.910
> P8: Just to see what it would actually say.

242
00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:33.760
Tyler: Okay.

243
00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:40.489
Tyler: did you? Had you noticed the the label that says replied, before you open the filter.

244
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:43.370
> P8: no.

245
00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:43.950
Tyler: Okay.

246
00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:50.890
> P8: There's the 2 up here in progress and reopen. So I didn't even notice these said reply.

247
00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:53.640
> P8: Maybe they said the same.

248
00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:55.169
> P8: You noticed that.

249
00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:59.910
Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. So you're sort of like skimming very generally.

250
00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:00.480
> P8: Yeah.

251
00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:04.822
Tyler: Enough to to let you know that there are some sorts of statuses.

252
00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:12.360
Tyler: cool. Okay. And then you use the status which you know, only showed you a couple of questions that have a reply.

253
00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:15.599
Tyler: That felt pretty straightforward, right.

254
00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:16.210
> P8: Yeah.

255
00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:17.120
Tyler: Okay.

256
00:18:18.012 --> 00:18:20.549
Tyler: Is there any other? Go ahead.

257
00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:21.930
> P8: I like it when.

258
00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:23.750
> P8: like different

259
00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:31.310
> P8: headings, like reopened, replied Progress. If it had, like different colors to represent

260
00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:35.259
> P8: like, reopened a reply to probably make it more stand out.

261
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:38.059
> P8: At least for me.

262
00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:39.490
Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

263
00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:45.849
Tyler: There's obviously a couple of different statuses we've got in progress. We've got reopened we've got, replied.

264
00:18:46.743 --> 00:18:51.739
Tyler: Which one of those you think is more important for you to focus on. If you could say that.

265
00:18:53.880 --> 00:19:03.110
> P8: probably the in progress one, because that has to deal with disability. Compensations are concerned about that. Those are

266
00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:07.589
> P8: replied. They're older. This one's more recent.

267
00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.090
> P8: and

268
00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:11.699
> P8: that one says reopened

269
00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:16.640
> P8: But the veteran didn't reopen it. Then

270
00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:20.070
> P8: it'd be curious to see why that one's reopened.

271
00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.390
Tyler: Okay.

272
00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:35.129
Tyler: so you said in progress, because, it's about disability compensation, which is really important and then you also noticed that it's it's a newer question compared to some of these older ones.

273
00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:35.950
> P8: Yes.

274
00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:42.349
Tyler: Okay and reopen. What? What do you think that means? I know that you you sense that it was maybe not clear.

275
00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:43.970
> P8: Oh, like.

276
00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:49.009
> P8: Usually it could be in progress, replied.

277
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:50.600
> P8: Closed

278
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:54.099
> P8: but reopen means that

279
00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:55.670
> P8: the case

280
00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:58.010
> P8: has been reopened for

281
00:19:58.060 --> 00:19:59.210
> P8: some reason.

282
00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:01.150
Tyler: Okay.

283
00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:07.649
Tyler: so it's clear that it's been reopened and kind of what that means, but it's not clear, why it was reopened.

284
00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:08.410
> P8: Yeah.

285
00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:09.050
Tyler: Okay.

286
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:15.110
Tyler: And while you were listing those you said you said in progress, replied.

287
00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:17.949
Tyler: closed and reopened.

288
00:20:18.878 --> 00:20:22.789
Tyler: How, how does closed differ from? Replied.

289
00:20:25.125 --> 00:20:25.840
> P8: Means.

290
00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:27.989
> P8: If the

291
00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:33.620
> P8: the question is answered, there's no further need to reply. Then

292
00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:37.250
> P8: close the the case out or close the

293
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:38.680
> P8: I guess ticket.

294
00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:39.960
Tyler: Yeah.

295
00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:43.340
Tyler: and who would decide when something's closed.

296
00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:46.910
> P8: Doing.

297
00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:56.959
> P8: I'd say, maybe after a certain amount of time, that's overlaps maybe the system, or maybe the veteran itself, if they're satisfied with

298
00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:01.919
> P8: how it was resolved, or if they

299
00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:03.820
> P8: got the answer they were seeking.

300
00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:06.569
Tyler: okay, great.

301
00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:16.179
Tyler: So it could be the system maybe based on time? Or it could be the veteran saying, okay, cool, this has been answered. Thanks so much. We're done with. This conversation.

302
00:21:17.362 --> 00:21:18.770
Tyler: Okay, that makes sense.

303
00:21:19.298 --> 00:21:24.019
Tyler: Okay, the next thing that I'd like you to do is find a question that's related to home loans.

304
00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:26.320
> P8: The home loans.

305
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:35.110
> P8: Okay.

306
00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:39.936
Tyler: Okay, cool. So you use the filter again.

307
00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:44.480
Tyler: And why do you think that you sought to use the filter right away?

308
00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:46.739
> P8: As it.

309
00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:56.409
> P8: When you go back there's at least 2 pages. So if there was more, it'd be easier just to click on the filter and go down to

310
00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.530
> P8: that subject.

311
00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:01.550
Tyler: Gotcha. Okay, cool.

312
00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:14.920
Tyler: So you're you know the filters. Now, you've already used one. So you thought to use the filter for category, and that seemed pretty straightforward overall. And then. And we did find that question. Right? So, okay, cool.

313
00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:21.609
Tyler: let's go ahead and filter so that we can see all the questions again.

314
00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:33.780
Tyler: Okay, perfect. So now we're back with all the questions.

315
00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:39.840
Tyler: and the last task on this page is, I'd like you to find a question that was submitted on August 24.th

316
00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:43.409
> P8: Right there.

317
00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:48.290
Tyler: Okay, yeah. How did you find that question?

318
00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:49.730
> P8: By looking at the date.

319
00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:55.320
Tyler: Okay, cool. So just skimming the page, you found the date pretty quickly, right.

320
00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:55.910
> P8: Yeah.

321
00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:56.940
> P8: and.

322
00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:02.689
Tyler: It says, August 24.th It also says, September 12, th what is the difference between those dates.

323
00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:09.400
> P8: by, about 2 weeks this one's last updated, so

324
00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:10.830
> P8: either

325
00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:14.030
> P8: it could mean that the veteran

326
00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:21.369
> P8: submitted another question, or submitted paperwork or something or

327
00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:24.839
> P8: the Va. Could have updated something on it.

328
00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:34.020
Tyler: Gotcha. So it could have been something from either the Va or the veteran that has made this change the last updated date. Right? Okay.

329
00:23:35.387 --> 00:23:40.840
Tyler: okay, cool. Is there anything else that you want to comment on on this page before we move on.

330
00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:44.490
> P8: not that I think of. No.

331
00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:45.460
Tyler: Okay?

### Details page

Tyler: And so obviously, we've talked a lot about this. These are questions that a veteran is asking the Va. Where would they find the answer from the Va. What would they do to find the answer, maybe, to this question. On August 24.th

333
00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:01.369
> P8: Probably click on the check details.

334
00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:02.680
Tyler: Okay.

335
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:05.690
Tyler: and what do you think would happen when you click check details.

336
00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.389
> P8: It takes me to another page

337
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:10.930
> P8: hopefully, it'll

338
00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:16.340
> P8: have this information category and the question, and maybe a response.

339
00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:22.459
Tyler: Okay, gotcha cool. Let's let's go ahead and do that. We'll click on check details for this question.

340
00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:28.789
Tyler: and it didn't seem like it was difficult to find that link right.

341
00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:29.710
> P8: Hmm.

342
00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:34.780
Tyler: Okay? And so on this page. The 1st thing I'd like you to do is find the reply the Va. Sent you.

343
00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:37.920
> P8: Response from Va.

344
00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:39.630
Tyler: Okay.

345
00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:42.030
Tyler: So that was pretty quick to find that right?

346
00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:49.379
Tyler: And how? How do you think you found that? Obviously you're quickly skimming the page visually? Was there anything that made it that easy to find.

347
00:24:50.327 --> 00:24:55.760
> P8: Under where it says, conversations. And I have these blocks down here.

348
00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.250
Tyler: Okay.

349
00:24:57.750 --> 00:25:01.319
Tyler: so let's go ahead and read the reply from the va.

350
00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:05.170
> P8: Big food.

351
00:25:06.666 --> 00:25:08.690
> P8: lots of veterans from

352
00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.100
> P8: alright.

353
00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:18.330
Tyler: Okay, so what did the Va say to you in this message?

354
00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:21.280
> P8: That the

355
00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:27.250
> P8: veterans identification card is only available to veterans.

356
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:30.029
> P8: Or they said, currently.

357
00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:31.040
> P8: Okay.

358
00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:37.040
> P8: for more information, go to va.gov.

359
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:42.199
Tyler: Okay, really.

360
00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:48.080
> P8: Sorry I have 4 kids keep me up at night.

361
00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:49.850
Tyler: Oh, no. Worries

362
00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:52.210
Tyler: it. Okay.

363
00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:55.789
> P8: It answers the the veterans question about

364
00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:57.700
> P8: getting

365
00:25:57.970 --> 00:26:01.689
> P8: his spouse a veteran card, but

366
00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:04.430
> P8: probably not the answer he was looking for, though.

367
00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:09.079
Tyler: And what what do you mean by that? What kind of answer do you think?

368
00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:10.180
> P8: He was wanting.

369
00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:12.930
> P8: They were wanting a

370
00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:16.919
> P8: how to go about getting a card for their spouse, for.

371
00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:18.810
> P8: Whatever reason.

372
00:26:19.309 --> 00:26:23.740
> P8: So they answered him, but not the answer he was hoping for.

373
00:26:24.064 --> 00:26:41.279
Tyler: Okay? Because the answer he was hoping for is like here's, how you get a id card for your spouse is that what you mean, okay, yeah, cool. And it sends you to va.gov. If you need more information, is there anything you would change about what the Va. Has said.

374
00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:45.809
> P8: Maybe put a little bit more

375
00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:52.129
> P8: context instead of the website. Just also say that

376
00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:56.650
> P8: the cards are only available for

377
00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:04.149
> P8: a hundred percent veterans or retired veterans.

378
00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:08.069
> P8: and then, for more information, go to the va.gov.

379
00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:09.040
Tyler: Okay.

380
00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:14.530
Tyler: So a little bit more context, to make sure it's super clear. And

381
00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:25.100
Tyler: it doesn't necessarily sound like you would have follow up questions to this reply. But let's just say that. Oh, go ahead.

382
00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:31.160
> P8: Well, the other one was already open. So he does have a follow up question, because

383
00:27:32.278 --> 00:27:37.779
> P8: words. Matter, and the system said is currently only available. So the

384
00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:41.089
> P8: this person replied, saying, basically

385
00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:45.630
> P8: looking at that, does that mean? At some point it will be available for spouses.

386
00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:48.309
> P8: So that's why

387
00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:53.439
> P8: I think that it should. The response should change, that. It's only for

388
00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:59.049
> P8: permanently and totally disabled veterans, 100% veterans and retired.

389
00:28:00.457 --> 00:28:05.652
Tyler: Okay, Gotcha. So you notice that there's this other?

390
00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:10.370
Tyler: message, Underneath, that was sent on september 12, th

391
00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:16.929
Tyler: and and that was clear to you that that is, the veteran replying to the Va.

392
00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:17.710
> P8: Yes.

393
00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:18.220
Tyler: Okay.

394
00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:20.390
> P8: Because it says your reply to the Va.

395
00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:21.720
Tyler: Okay, Gotcha.

396
00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:29.859
Tyler: Okay, cool. So what we're going to do now, do you have anything else you want to comment on on this page so far.

397
00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:37.280
> P8: No.

398
00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:38.150
Tyler: Okay.

399
00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:54.703
Tyler: cool. It seems like it's been pretty straightforward for you. I also have noticed that so far, we're just navigating visually. We're not using any sort of additional assistive technology and and clicking around the page right?

### Reply sent

Tyler: the next thing I want to do is, have you send the Va. A message back. So we're gonna pretend, like, you know, you sent them this message on September 12.th You're frustrated. It's taking so long. You've decided you're going to just send another one and at this point you can write. You know you can write anything in here. I wouldn't think too too closely about what you say. And if you'd like to, you can just type the message, or you can use dragon if you think that's what you would maybe do in this situation.

401
00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:33.600
> P8: And

402
00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:38.029
> P8: has there been any update on the status of this question.

403
00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:44.010
> P8: and see it's not working for this for some reason.

404
00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:48.440
> P8: It's on.

405
00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:51.550
Tyler: Yeah.

406
00:29:52.540 --> 00:30:00.380
Tyler: do you often use dragon? And like this? Where you're type dictating like, straight into a website or.

407
00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:00.779
> P8: Do you.

408
00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:02.750
Tyler: Often use it in a document.

409
00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:03.819
> P8: In a document.

410
00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:05.060
Tyler: Okay.

411
00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:06.300
Tyler: Gotcha.

412
00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:10.710
Tyler: so in this situation.

413
00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:17.069
Tyler: would you end up opening up a document and and using dragon there, or, would you end up typing.

414
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:19.150
> P8: Probably end up typing because

415
00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:25.530
> P8: opening up with another document, talking and copying and pasting. That's just taking up too much

416
00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:27.470
> P8: time and work to

417
00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:28.880
> P8: to do that.

418
00:30:29.352 --> 00:30:31.240
Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

419
00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:33.590
Tyler: Okay, well.

420
00:30:35.076 --> 00:30:37.570
Tyler: go ahead. Were you gonna say something.

421
00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:41.969
> P8: I was. Gonna say, I'd probably have to find out if there's like an extension for

422
00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:44.029
> P8: or another, add on.

423
00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:49.299
> P8: To be plugged into, or a plugin, I guess, to chrome.

424
00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:51.010
Tyler: Gotcha.

425
00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:54.720
Tyler: Yeah, it sounds like Sara has mentioned that

426
00:30:54.780 --> 00:31:05.850
Tyler: the Dragon Web extension that you are using has to be enabled in in your browser. So maybe that's part of why it's not working right now.

427
00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:15.540
> P8: Yeah, I must not have it, cause it's not here.

428
00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:32.209
Tyler: yeah, and maybe something that you need to download in that case which i'm not gonna i'm not gonna make you do that in front of me. But you you totally are welcome to do that, and and hopefully that works

429
00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:47.089
Tyler: better. But Sara said, if you opened up what you just had opened and then you typed in Dragon in the search bar. There. It might come up and you can download the extension, and then try and see if that works better with you. When you're on the web.

430
00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:47.720
> P8: Okay.

431
00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:49.025
Tyler: Cool

432
00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:50.240
> P8: There!

433
00:31:51.360 --> 00:32:00.010
Tyler: Thanks, Sara. Okay, awesome. So for now let's just type in like, you can just type in like one word here. And we will continue.

434
00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:11.349
Tyler: okay, cool. So now that we've got a message in is there anything else you would do before you send your reply?

435
00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:20.929
> P8: If I had supporting documents I'd probably upload them. But if it's just asking questions, I don't think

436
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:22.420
> P8: okay.

437
00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:29.730
Tyler: Cool, so it seemed obvious to you that you don't have to upload a file. But you you might in another situation.

438
00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:30.420
> P8: Yes.

439
00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:34.129
Tyler: Okay, cool. Go ahead and send your reply when you're ready.

440
00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:43.470
Tyler: Cool, and then tell me what the Va. Is letting you know on this page.

441
00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:45.790
> P8: That the

442
00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:48.510
> P8: my question was sent successfully.

443
00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:53.630
> P8: Your question has now been reopened.

444
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:55.470
> P8: so

445
00:32:55.790 --> 00:32:59.150
> P8: should have received reply, within 7 days, Tuesdays

446
00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:01.469
> P8: Commission will contact you.

447
00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:03.319
> P8: So I guess when

448
00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:07.169
> P8: I guess when they send a

449
00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:09.130
> P8: receive

450
00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:10.310
> P8: wants

451
00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:16.539
> P8: it reopen, or when you send a response, it reopens it. But

452
00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:22.129
> P8: thinking back before. It said that the

453
00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:26.380
> P8: case was replied. It didn't say reopened.

454
00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:28.400
> P8: Even though

455
00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:30.190
> P8: the veteran had

456
00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:36.420
> P8: Their response was the last one, not the Va's.

457
00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:39.520
Tyler: okay.

458
00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:42.240
Tyler: so that's

459
00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:45.069
Tyler: it sounds like, it's getting a little hard to track

460
00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:47.680
Tyler: the status change and kind of like.

461
00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:51.570
Tyler: what reopened might mean? Versus what replied might mean.

462
00:33:51.570 --> 00:33:52.410
> P8: Yes.

463
00:33:52.410 --> 00:33:52.960
Tyler: Okay.

464
00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:54.110
Tyler: yeah.

465
00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:55.600
Tyler: that makes sense.

466
00:33:57.850 --> 00:34:06.839
Tyler: we talked about the 7 business days. So I'm guessing that that doesn't come as a surprise at this point. Is there any information that's missing from this page?

467
00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:11.708
> P8: No, it's the Va. Everything takes forever. So.

468
00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:13.590
Tyler: Okay.

469
00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:17.819
> P8: 7 to 14 business days, and it wouldn't surprise most veterans.

470
00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:18.610
Tyler: Right?

471
00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:19.969
Tyler: Okay.

472
00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:22.122
Tyler: that that makes sense.

### Cool down

Tyler: I don't think I have any more questions on this. So it looks like we're gonna be good on time, which is awesome.

474
00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:39.239
Tyler: At this point you're welcome to stop sharing your screen if you like. And we can just come back and have a chat for the last couple of minutes before we finish.

475
00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:47.449
Tyler: Okay, cool. So overall. How did you find that process.

476
00:34:49.495 --> 00:34:50.409
> P8: Informative.

477
00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:51.349
Tyler: And that's like.

478
00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:55.910
> P8: That if you send a response it reopens it because some veterans

479
00:34:57.630 --> 00:35:04.720
> P8: if the Va. Closes it, then they're just going to get more frustrated if they're closing their case without it being solved.

480
00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:07.880
> P8: So it automatically reopens

481
00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:12.800
> P8: the discussion, or whatever the questions are.

482
00:35:13.236 --> 00:35:19.560
Tyler: Yeah, I can see how that's a good thing. Do you think that the word reopen describes that process well.

483
00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.310
> P8: Yes.

484
00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:23.630
> P8: now.

485
00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:30.530
> P8: like I said before, where his that person's response was the last one, and it just said reply.

486
00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:32.440
> P8: that didn't really

487
00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:37.900
> P8: say anything, because the veteran replied to it, not the Va.

488
00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:39.580
Tyler: Okay.

489
00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:40.860
Tyler: when it's.

490
00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:43.999
> P8: The may have been closed, because if it was reopened.

491
00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:47.539
> P8: then that means the case was closed, and so

492
00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:49.850
> P8: the veteran may be more

493
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.270
> P8: frustrated.

494
00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:54.359
> P8: So he asked a question

495
00:35:54.410 --> 00:36:02.150
> P8: and didn't get a response, and then he, they submit a question, and then it says, reopened.

496
00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:04.120
> P8: what's that? Tell them.

497
00:36:04.583 --> 00:36:11.530
Tyler: Okay, Gotcha. So you're sort of expecting that what would make more sense is

498
00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:21.919
Tyler: i've sent a reply to the va, so my case is now reopened. The Va. Sends a reply to me, and it says, replied, or or closed, or something like that.

499
00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:24.420
Tyler: Okay, Gotcha.

500
00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:34.380
Tyler: And we talked about how it's ideal. If the veteran was able to say, when a question is has been answered versus the Va. Saying it's been answered.

501
00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:58.970
Tyler: Is there anything else that you wanted to comment on with that experience? I mean, at the beginning we talked about how like sometimes your your vision has gotten a little bit like not as good. And so it can be like more difficult on websites. And you're thinking about maybe using dragon more. Did you have? Did you encounter any of those issues while you were using this website?

502
00:36:59.170 --> 00:37:01.870
Tyler: Any trouble like being able to read anything.

503
00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:06.229
> P8: No I put my glasses on, and

504
00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:07.549
> P8: I think

505
00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:11.969
> P8: the screen's not that far away, so it's a little easier this time.

506
00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:17.440
> P8: When I'm at home is usually when I do a lot of my

507
00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:19.649
> P8: stuff for the Va.

508
00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:20.850
Tyler: Right.

509
00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:28.480
Tyler: And have you noticed the Va websites like having difficulty being able to see things on va websites.

510
00:37:30.271 --> 00:37:32.199
> P8: When it's up and running. Yeah.

511
00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:33.650
Tyler: Yeah.

512
00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:35.100
Tyler: that makes sense.

513
00:37:37.010 --> 00:38:02.660
Tyler: okay. And obviously, we talked about how you you might use dragon in this scenario essentially, just when you're typing something. And I'm gonna actually send you a link in the chat before I forget. This is just a direct link to get the chrome extension for dragon. So I just sent that on the Zoom chat, and if you want to open that before we finish, you can save that link.

514
00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:04.300
> P8: Alright. Thank you.

515
00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:05.816
Tyler: No worries.

516
00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:31.470
Tyler: I think that's all my questions it was helpful to watch you go through the the tool. It was. It was useful to see like when you decided to use the filters and and how you understood some of those statuses and things like that. Overall. It felt fairly straightforward. And I also understand that it might not be a tool you would think about using in a lot of scenarios because of the waiting time, which is good feedback.

517
00:38:32.182 --> 00:38:35.600
Tyler: Anything else you want to share with me before we we wrap up.

518
00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:39.230
> P8: But if they had more

519
00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:44.719
> P8: manageable time frames, it wouldn't be that bad to use.

520
00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:49.500
> P8: Or I liked. I forgot to point out where it said

521
00:38:50.255 --> 00:38:54.939
> P8: the date that it was submitted, and the last update, those

522
00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:59.889
> P8: that could be beneficial, too. Like for the disability compensation.

523
00:39:00.357 --> 00:39:03.689
> P8: At least some sort of tracker that shows last update that way.

524
00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:06.790
> P8: It reduced. Maybe the phone calls. I can

525
00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:12.120
> P8: use that just to check to see when it was last updated, or if any activity was on it.

526
00:39:12.414 --> 00:39:24.209
Tyler: Yeah, for sure, that makes sense. That's a good point that it's something that's available in this tool and it's not available in kind of a similar tool. So I could see how that would be useful.

527
00:39:25.041 --> 00:39:27.770
Tyler: Cool. Do you have any questions for me?

528
00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:30.040
> P8: None right now, no.

529
00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:42.886
Tyler: Okay, awesome. Well, we really appreciate you spending the time with us this morning. I'm sorry about the time being communicated. Incorrectly. I am hoping that that won't happen again.

530
00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:47.279
Tyler: and yeah, I hope you keep participating in research with the Va. We really appreciate it.

531
00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:50.790
> P8: Thank you. I appreciate it. You guys do a good job.

532
00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:53.520
> P8: I like the new updates that you guys are doing.

533
00:39:53.970 --> 00:40:01.459
Tyler: Good. Well, we. We can only do those things because we get to talk to veterans a lot. So I appreciate your time. And hope you have a good rest of your day.

534
00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:02.590
> P8: You do the same.

535
00:40:02.590 --> 00:40:03.319
Tyler: Bye, [P8].

> P8: Bye, guys.
