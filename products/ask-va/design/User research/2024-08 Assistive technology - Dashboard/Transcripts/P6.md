### Warm up

Tyler: Okay. So the recording has started, I just want to confirm, if you're comfortable, that I record my screen and audio today.

> P6: Yes.

Tyler: Okay, awesome. That was a lot of information. And we met a lot of different people. Do you have any questions for me?

> P6: No, ma'am, I don't. Okay.

Tyler: before we get started with setting up the website, I have just a couple of questions so I can better understand your experience with the VA. How long have you been a Veteran?

> P6: Since 1996.

Tyler: Okay, did you start interacting with the VA right when you got out of service?

> P6: not really. No I signed up with them, but for the most part I was working so I felt like I didn't need to be a.

11
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:55.160
Tyler: Okay. And and nowadays, are you mostly interacting with the va for your healthcare or what's a common interaction with the VA?

> P6: That's the only.

14
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.319
> P6: Va is my primary. Now, okay.

15
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.740
Tyler: How are you contacting the Va. These days?

16
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.360
> P6: I use the phone.

17
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.769
> P6: Okay, the contact center.

18
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.180
Tyler: Okay, the contact center. So you're calling over the phone.

19
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:25.160
> P6: Yes, if I have a a question like I said, I tried to get into that my healthy bit. I haven't gotten into it yet.

20
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.299
Tyler: Okay.

21
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:33.450
Tyler: so you haven't been able to use like any sort of online messaging so you've just been using the phone call.

22
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.560
> P6: Yes, calling the contact center. Leave the messages for my doctors.

23
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.230
Tyler: Right.

24
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.400
> P6: Call me back!

25
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.839
Tyler: How do? How do you find that? Would you prefer to be able to to talk to people online? Or, do you prefer the phone.

26
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.320
> P6: Really prefer the phone.

27
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.940
Tyler: You prefer the phone? Why is that.

28
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.000
> P6: Because I can hear their voice.

29
00:01:53.150 --> 00:02:01.271
> P6: And when you say talking to him online, are you referring like Zoom call like we're doing now, or just typing in what I want to say I don't. I don't like the chat.

30
00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:10.740
Tyler: You don't like the chat. Yeah, is that is that like a personal preference? Cause you like to have sort of a more human interaction, or what? What makes you prefer to talk to someone on the phone over.

31
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.010
> P6: Human in a rat

32
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.630
Tyler: That makes sense. How do you find it using a chat with your screen, reader.

33
00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.969
> P6: How do I? Wi-fi? What now?

34
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:29.100
Tyler: When you're using a chat. So maybe you're like using a chat on a website where you're talking to somebody. And you're using your screen. Reader, have you had that experience before?

35
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.619
> P6: I really don't like it.

36
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.880
> P6: Because to me

37
00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.010
> P6: I kind of get my answer slow.

38
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.079
> P6: or I have explained something over and over, and that's very aggravated.

39
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:50.963
Tyler: Yeah, I could see that. So you feel like, it's easier for you to get help maybe more, efficiently,

40
00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.030
> P6: I pick up the phone and call them.

41
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.349
Tyler: Yeah. Have you heard of something called? Ask Va.

42
00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.860
> P6: No.

43
00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:15.390
Tyler: Okay, well, we're gonna talk about, ask Va today. But before we do that I do want to learn a little bit more about how you're using your assistive technology? So we talked about how you use a screen, reader? And you're on your ipad right now, are you using voice over on your ipad.

44
00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.340
> P6: Yes.

45
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.469
Tyler: how long have you been using voiceover.

46
00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.819
> P6: Every June of 2015.

47
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.950
Tyler: Okay? 2015, and how often are you using it?

48
00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:28.930
> P6: Every day.

49
00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.909
> P6: When I'm on the phone, when I'm on my computer, when I'm on my laptop. What's over.

50
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:36.520
Tyler: Okay.

51
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.990
> P6: Operate the phone without it.

52
00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.160
Tyler: Operate the phone without it.

53
00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.520
> P6: And not the phone.

54
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.300
Tyler: Can't. Okay.

55
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.200
> P6: Any of it without voice, over.

56
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.060
Tyler: Gotcha.

57
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:51.684
> P6: I have is light perception, so doesn't do me any good. I won't be. I don't. I'm not able to see.

58
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:54.930
Tyler: That makes sense.

59
00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:04.819
Tyler: Okay, awesome. That's really helpful background. And what browser do you usually use when you're on your phone or your ipad or your computer.

60
00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.340
> P6: When you say browser.

61
00:04:07.107 --> 00:04:09.170
Tyler: Like, for example, safari might be one that.

62
00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.010
> P6: Oh yes!

63
00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.325
Tyler: Okay.

64
00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.679
> P6: Is what I use.

65
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.330
Tyler: Okay.

66
00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:13.420
Tyler: Awesome.

67
00:04:13.898 --> 00:04:21.150
Tyler: I just want to check and see if Sara has any other questions. About your assistive tech or anything like that before we move on.

68
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.100
Tyler: Sara. I think I don't think I heard you, but.

69
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.149
Sara: I do. I do not have any more questions

70
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.120
Sara: cool.

71
00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:34.200
Tyler: Thank you.

72
00:04:34.883 --> 00:04:35.809
Tyler: All right.

73
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.419
Tyler: Oh, go ahead, [P6].

74
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.200
> P6: I said. She speaks so softly.

75
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:50.020
Tyler: Yeah, I didn't hear it at first, st either, but I did hear her the second time. Awesome. Okay. So the next thing we're gonna do is get you set up sharing your screen on zoom? Have you ever shared your screen on zoom.

76
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.180
> P6: No, ma'am, and I have to learn how to operate zoom, because

77
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.480
> P6: I'm the facilitator of our women's group, and I've got to run my own meeting.

78
00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.470
Tyler: Okay.

79
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.550
Tyler: okay? When when's the meeting? You said next week.

80
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:04.830
> P6: On the 26.th

81
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:26.130
Tyler: Okay, yeah, zoom is a little bit tricky. But it's definitely one of those things where the more you use it the easier it becomes. So we're gonna have a go at sharing your screen today on Zoom, which just means that I'm gonna be able to see what you can see on your screen and so I'm gonna try and help you out. And Sara's here also to help if we need extra help. So

82
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:35.519
Tyler: we're gonna have you share your screen. Which I'm gonna try and be quiet when your screen readers talking, because I'm not going to be able to hear your screen, reader? But

83
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:57.320
Tyler: essentially, you're gonna navigate to something on the menu options on zoom that should say, Share and then once you get to share. It's going to give you different options of things you can share, so it might say, like a URL and different things like that. And you're gonna listen for a screen, I believe, and Sara correct me if I'm wrong in in saying any of that before we start.

84
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:01.830
Sara: That sounds right.

85
00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:08.820
Tyler: Okay, cool. So does that sound? Okay, [P6], we're going to give you a second to try and do that. And you just let us know if you're having any difficulty.

86
00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.890
> P6: Okay.

87
00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.900
Tyler: Okay.

88
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.259
> P6: Do you want me to do it? Now try to do it now.

89
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:15.470
Tyler: Yes, please.

90
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:15.815
> P6: Oh.

91
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:26.340
> P6: their content!

92
00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:33.550
Tyler: It's not share contact. Are you? What other options are you hearing.

93
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:38.800
> P6: -Oh!

94
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.420
> P6: Did I shut you off.

95
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.280
Tyler: No, I can hear you say that one more time.

96
00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:51.870
Tyler: Can you hear me?

97
00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.709
> P6: What do I say? It said to start the broadcast.

98
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:02.900
Tyler: Okay, perfect. That's what you. That's what you want. Start broadcast.

99
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.169
> P6: Okay. It counted it, counted down.

100
00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:17.390
Tyler: It looks like it's starting. Okay, perfect.

101
00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:26.143
Tyler: awesome. So I'm just remembering that sometimes we have this issue on ipads. I am able to see your screen now.

102
00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:31.360
Tyler: And Thomas, I can't remember if we had figured out

103
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.386
Tyler: if we learned anything differently about this or Sara

104
00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:52.719
Tyler: So while we think about how to fix this [P6], I'll just tell you what's happening. So you've shared your screen. And so now I can see what you're seeing, but it's it has like a message, and we're not exactly sure how to get the message to go away. So just bear with us for a second.

105
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:53.559
> P6: No, I'll.

106
00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:04.610
Tyler: Okay, awesome. It looks like Sara has some helpful tips. So

107
00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:08.840
Tyler: it sounds like, after

108
00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:13.530
Tyler: I'm just reading through these notes.

109
00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:33.309
Tyler: So let's try this. So from the bottom of your screen. If you drag one finger until you hear 2 rising tones, then lift your finger.

110
00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:40.489
> P6: Okay.

111
00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:42.399
Tyler: Okay, perfect.

112
00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:45.559
Tyler: amazing. Okay?

113
00:08:46.279 --> 00:08:47.709
Tyler: I think that worked.

114
00:08:49.669 --> 00:08:57.269
Tyler: So now we're on the zoom window. And the next thing we're going to do is, get you set up on the website. That we're going to be looking at together today. So

115
00:08:57.349 --> 00:09:12.389
Tyler: there's 2 options we can have you navigate to safari. And then we can type in or or dictate the website from there. Or I can send you the website. And it's gonna come through as a link in the chat on Zoom, and you're going to open that link.

116
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:13.620
> P6: Okay.

117
00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:15.550
Tyler: What! What do you prefer?

118
00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:16.830
> P6: Let's try to link.

119
00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:25.069
Tyler: Let's try the link. Okay. So I think at the top of your zoom window there's gonna be some different controls. And you're gonna it's probably gonna be called chat.

120
00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:27.280
Tyler: So let's try and find that first.st

121
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:55.330
Tyler: Okay. I wonder if you have to navigate to something called more

122
00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:01.220
Tyler: perfect.

123
00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:04.400
Tyler: There you go.

124
00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:09.549
Tyler: So we'll just open that chat. Now you should be able to.

125
00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:12.550
Tyler: It looks like you're focused on. Yep.

126
00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:24.399
Tyler: perfect. Okay, so I'm going to send this in the chat now. So the link's gonna come through, and when you hear it come through you can you can go ahead and and open it. Just bear with me one second.

127
00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:37.889
Tyler: So I just sent you that link

128
00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:56.960
Tyler: perfect.

129
00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:08.819
Tyler: awesome. So we're all set up in the right place. I just want to check that your screen, reader isn't announcing right now.

130
00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:10.130
> P6: It's.

131
00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:11.450
Tyler: Interrupting it. Okay, cool.

### Dashboard

Tyler: All right. Thank you. That was great. We're all set up. So now what we're going to do. I'm going to give you a little bit of context about this page before we get started. Before we before I do that. Do you have any questions at this point.

133
00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:24.960
> P6: Done. Okay.

134
00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:46.240
Tyler: So we're going to be observing you using this website. And this is a tool called, Ask Va, it's a way for veterans to contact the Va to ask a question online for today's session. We're gonna pretend, like you've recently asked the Va. A question. And and you've signed into your account on Va. Gov, so you can read the reply from the Va.

135
00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:51.710
Tyler: And we're going to go through a couple different tasks, which I'm going to explain as we go along.

136
00:11:52.303 --> 00:12:15.659
Tyler: And as you navigate, we want to understand what's going on for you and what your screen reader might be announcing. Like, I said. I can't hear your screen, reader, right now. And so I'm gonna do my best to stay quiet while you're focused on a task. But if you can pause every once in a while, let me know what you're thinking. Let me know if things are confusing, or if you didn't hear what your screen reader said. And we can. We can talk about it.

137
00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:17.760
Tyler: How does that all sound to you?

138
00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:40.060
Tyler: Okay, awesome. So the 1st thing we have to do is a little bit funny. Essentially, we need to get into the the place where we're gonna start the test. And so what's gonna happen is, you're gonna navigate down to a heading that's called Research Study and under the heading Research study, there's gonna be a sign in button. So we're gonna click on that sign in button.

139
00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:53.930
> P6: Oh!

140
00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:10.780
Tyler: So it's.

141
00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:13.410
> P6: Is that it's saying sign in right now.

142
00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:23.160
Tyler: Yeah, exactly. This part's a little confusing. So there's a sign in button that I can see that you were focused on. We're going to try and go past it until we hear something that says, research.

143
00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:34.400
Tyler: okay.

144
00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:40.520
> P6: Research study.

145
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:48.229
Tyler: Perfect. Yeah. So now we're on research study and you'll navigate down and you'll hear another sign in button, and then we'll click on that.

146
00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:57.241
> P6: It's saying I'm I'll need to.

147
00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.289
Tyler: Yeah. And you can. [P6].

148
00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:00.920
> P6: Hmm.

149
00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:11.569
Tyler: You can just kind of ignore this, because this is we don't actually need to even pay attention to the content. We just want to get you to this. Pretend sign in button, so keep going from where you are

150
00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:18.960
Tyler: perfect.

151
00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:21.090
> P6: Double, tap.

152
00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:22.250
Tyler: Yes, please.

153
00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:26.689
Tyler: Awesome, alright.

154
00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:27.940
Tyler: So

155
00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:41.870
Tyler: we're what we just did is a little funny, but it's a way for us to pretend like you just signed in. So we're gonna pretend like you've now signed into your account. You're on va.gov and you've just arrived at. Ask Va.

156
00:14:42.110 --> 00:15:01.490
Tyler: so the 1st thing I want you to do is just orient yourself on this page. So I'm going to give you a couple of minutes. You can navigate around and after you finish I just want you to explain what's on this page to me. The only thing I will say is, if you if you land on a link, or a button, or something, you want to click before you click it. Can you let me know.

157
00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:02.300
> P6: Okay.

158
00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:03.450
Tyler: Okay. Awesome.

159
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:12.049
> P6: Can I click on that.

160
00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:15.510
Tyler: So

161
00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:20.310
Tyler: did it seem like you could click on that. I saw what you'd highlighted?

162
00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:23.720
Tyler: Did it seem like that? Was something you could click on.

163
00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.470
Tyler: or you would click on.

164
00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:33.349
> P6: I can't see any colors or anything.

165
00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:48.979
Tyler: Yeah, that's okay. So the the text that you were highlighting isn't actually something that you can click on but I'm wondering also. What makes you want to click on it? What? What are you thinking? You might see if you do click on it, or you might hear.

166
00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:51.759
> P6: Oh, I don't know. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna

167
00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:53.210
> P6: keep going.

168
00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:54.570
Tyler: Okay, go ahead.

169
00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:56.080
> P6: Something else interests me.

170
00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.670
> P6: and as soon as they say that I'm gonna click on that.

171
00:17:41.158 --> 00:17:44.090
Tyler: Okay. So the the phone number.

172
00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:49.998
Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense, and that that's kind of what you said to me earlier as well. So

173
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:56.829
Tyler: you've went through this page now, and I'd love for you to tell me what information is available on this page.

174
00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:04.210
> P6: Information about Va claims information about how to get an Id card. And

175
00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:06.150
> P6: wow!

176
00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:07.339
> P6: I don't know.

177
00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.579
> P6: I'm trying to think what was the last one.

178
00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:10.860
> P6: Oh.

179
00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:13.519
> P6: information about technical

180
00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:15.800
> P6: difficulties

181
00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:17.770
> P6: logging into BA.

182
00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:18.790
Tyler: Okay.

183
00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:28.110
Tyler: yeah. So there's some different information about different sorts of like situations with the Va, right?

184
00:18:29.911 --> 00:18:36.154
Tyler: and a lot of these are are questions, right? Who who asked these questions.

185
00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:38.430
> P6: Previous people.

186
00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.739
> P6: Well, if it's my page, then I'm I'm the one who asked the question. Okay.

187
00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:49.070
Tyler: Gotcha. So it's your your account we're pretending like it's your account. And you ask the Vi. These questions.

188
00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:54.439
Tyler: Okay, great. And at 1 point you were like, I, I kind of want to click on this.

189
00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:54.910
> P6: And I'm sure.

190
00:18:54.910 --> 00:19:02.510
Tyler: Curious. What made you want to click on it like? What were you hoping you would see if you or you or you would. What would happen next if you did click on it.

191
00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:07.279
> P6: To give me the information I need in order to get my spouse an id card.

192
00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.610
Tyler: Gotcha. Okay.

193
00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:13.240
Tyler: So you were kind of expecting essentially the answer.

194
00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:13.980
> P6: Yes.

195
00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:15.879
Tyler: Okay, that makes sense.

196
00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:21.090
Tyler: Is there anything you found confusing? Besides, maybe that that as you navigated this page.

197
00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:25.189
> P6: Not really. I was going kind of fast.

198
00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:27.590
> P6: Tendency to do that. I don't.

199
00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:32.809
> P6: I'll get part of. I'll listen to part of, and if it's not what I need I'll just keep going.

200
00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:55.800
Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. So you're sort of skimming, which sounds like it's kind of a regular behavior for you. I totally. Yeah, I totally get that? Okay, well, so there's an there's a couple of questions on this page, obviously, and the next thing I would like you to do is just to find a question that has a reply from the Va. So when you find that question, just let me know, and we can talk about it.

201
00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:58.360
> P6: Okay, do I need to start back from the beginning.

202
00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:02.830
Tyler: It's up to you. You can start where you are if you want to. Just go up from there. Whatever you want to do.

203
00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:18.139
> P6: On the Va. Location.

204
00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:24.290
Tyler: So it looks like you're up in the sort of the top navigation of the page.

205
00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:25.380
> P6: As we are.

206
00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.279
Tyler: Yeah, there you go.

207
00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:19.889
> P6: I'm sorry I got a little distracted. What am I supposed to be doing.

208
00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:20.560
Tyler: Okay.

209
00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:24.059
Tyler: you're looking for a question that has a reply from the Va.

210
00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:44.579
> P6: Right there. There's 1.

211
00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:45.580
Tyler: Okay.

212
00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:47.020
> P6: About the id card.

213
00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.180
> P6: You want me click on it.

214
00:21:49.936 --> 00:21:52.544
Tyler: We can just sit here for a minute.

215
00:21:54.310 --> 00:22:01.800
Tyler: I'm curious without clicking on anything. What would you click on if you did want to click on this question. Can you show me where you would click

216
00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:03.530
Tyler: if I want to click.

217
00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:04.340
> P6: Question.

218
00:22:04.625 --> 00:22:10.630
Tyler: Just if you wanted to click on this this one that has a reply, do you know what you would highlight.

219
00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:14.219
Tyler: Is that where you are right now.

220
00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:15.784
> P6: Where? Where it says?

221
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:17.680
> P6: Replied.

222
00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.260
Tyler: Okay, gotcha

223
00:22:20.284 --> 00:22:29.495
Tyler: awesome. So we found this question has a reply from the Va. And it I assume that you figured that out. Because it says, replied, Right,

224
00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:35.259
Tyler: Is there any other way to figure out? If a question has a reply from the Va.

225
00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:36.870
> P6: You can click on the link.

226
00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:38.850
Tyler: Okay.

227
00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:42.759
Tyler: yeah. The link that says replied.

228
00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:44.010
Tyler: Yeah.

229
00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:47.529
> P6: We can. Okay, a link that says reply, or

230
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:50.230
> P6: it had a link above the reply.

231
00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:51.470
Tyler: Gotcha.

232
00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.309
Tyler: Okay, that's helpful.

233
00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:01.329
Tyler: Could you tell if there was more than one question that had a reply from the Va.

234
00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:02.830
> P6: I believe I did.

235
00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:16.790
> P6: So I'm in a technical.

236
00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:27.989
> P6: Okay, there's 1 that was replied to, okay.

237
00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:33.440
> P6: what.

238
00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:45.580
Tyler: So.

239
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:48.750
Tyler: [P6], I'm going to have us pause here for a minute.

240
00:23:49.967 --> 00:23:54.920
Tyler: The next thing I'm hoping that we could do is try and find a question that's related to home loans.

241
00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:55.950
> P6: Okay.

242
00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:18.679
> P6: I just thought about

243
00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:25.199
> P6: in order to go from one to the other. Then I gotta go to category.

244
00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.140
Tyler: Say that 1 1 more time for me.

245
00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:33.369
> P6: It's talk, it's talk. What'd you say now?

246
00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:39.540
Tyler: Oh, I just said could you say that? One more time for me? You said, in order to go from one to the other. I have to go to category.

247
00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:40.280
> P6: Yeah.

248
00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:42.140
Tyler: Okay, what do you mean by that.

249
00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:47.778
> P6: I don't know if this, if I'm saying it right. But

250
00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:48.530
Tyler: And.

251
00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:59.940
> P6: And and it said something about the different categories. Okay, so I'm assuming, if I click on that category link or category, it will give me a list of options to to click on.

252
00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:00.890
Tyler: Okay.

253
00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:06.950
Tyler: So we're you're hearing the word category. And you're thinking, maybe that's something I could click on and choose a category.

254
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:10.359
> P6: Yes, I thought I thought I heard them at the beginning.

255
00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:11.250
Tyler: Yeah.

256
00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:25.919
Tyler: that makes sense. I'm I'm kind of getting the sense that it's not 100% clear what you can click on and what you can't click on, which is helpful to to realize. Did you have any luck? Finding a question that was about home loans.

257
00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:27.469
> P6: No, I haven't finished yet.

258
00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:28.960
Tyler: Okay. I'll give you a second.

259
00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.170
> P6: Unless I missed it.

260
00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:34.610
> P6: What.

261
00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:37.070
Tyler: I think maybe you're oh, there you go!

262
00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:10.760
> P6: Homeless.

263
00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:22.970
Tyler: So

264
00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:26.210
Tyler: maybe we can pause here.

265
00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:28.270
> P6: Sergey.

266
00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:31.951
Tyler: Maybe we can just pause here for a minute when you have a second

267
00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:36.930
Tyler: What? Where do you think you are? Right now? You're hearing a lot of different links.

268
00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:39.287
> P6: The bottom when I I've heard

269
00:26:40.992 --> 00:26:42.320
> P6: when it was

270
00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:46.159
> P6: the Ti can't say it TTBY, or something like that.

271
00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:47.970
Tyler: okay.

272
00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:49.029
> P6: End of it.

273
00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:51.439
Tyler: Yeah, you're at the end of the page. Okay?

274
00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:55.700
Tyler: Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. Let's try and get.

275
00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:57.989
> P6: I didn't hear anything about home loans.

276
00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:17.779
Tyler: Okay? And that's okay. so you went through the whole page, and there's been nothing about home loans which I agree. Having watched you go through the page. We haven't seen anything about home loans, so you didn't. You didn't miss it. There was 1 point when you passed over actually where you are right now. What? What are you currently focused on right now?

277
00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:25.750
> P6: Eileen and technical issues.

278
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:33.430
Tyler: is there any moment when you're hearing something like page 2, or next okay.

279
00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:34.340
> P6: You're there!

280
00:27:34.572 --> 00:27:36.429
Tyler: What do you think that that would do?

281
00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:37.810
> P6: I have no idea.

282
00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:38.680
Tyler: Okay.

283
00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:41.989
> P6: The skip. Skip! To the next page.

284
00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:43.250
Tyler: Okay, and.

285
00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:44.430
> P6: All the way down.

286
00:27:45.068 --> 00:27:48.240
Tyler: And what do you think would be on the next page.

287
00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:49.839
> P6: I don't know.

288
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.639
> P6: Probably more confidence.

289
00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:56.311
Tyler: More questions. Okay, yeah, that's fair.

290
00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:05.001
Tyler: let's go ahead and and we'll move on. Cause I I know we've only got. I'm trying to finish around 4 pm. For you.

291
00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:07.240
Tyler: so.

292
00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:16.690
Tyler: But another thing I want to do is just have a look. If there is another way of finding a question about home loans that's not

293
00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:23.280
Tyler: reading the whole page. So maybe if you want to start at the top of the page again, so we can navigate up to the top.

294
00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:33.330
Tyler: Perfect. Yeah, we can start here, and then let's just spend a little bit of time seeing. Is there any other way for me to

295
00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:37.440
Tyler: find a question that's about a specific category.

296
00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:40.990
> P6: You want me to ask them that.

297
00:28:41.691 --> 00:28:53.040
Tyler: No, you can, just I I'd like for you to just have a look and see. So I know what we've been doing so far is it looks like you're reading through. Each piece of content on the page right? Kind of like, line by line.

298
00:28:53.852 --> 00:29:09.280
Tyler: And I'm curious. Is there any other way, for example, is there a way to search is there a way for us to to sort through the questions. Is there anything else like that that could be helpful? So far we haven't used anything like that right.

299
00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:10.900
> P6: No.

300
00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:16.170
Tyler: Okay. So let's just, is that okay, is that more clear? We'll just have a look to see if there is any way for us to do that

301
00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:17.659
Tyler: you can. Okay.

302
00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:19.440

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:39.810
Tyler: Yeah. So you can stay on. Ask Va, that. That's right. So if you if you just navigate down from here or yeah, perfect.

307
00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:41.850

308
00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:47.160

310
00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:54.770
Tyler: what comes after that?

311
00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:58.070
> P6: What'd you say?

312
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:59.260
Tyler: What comes after that.

313
00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:00.260
> P6: Oh.

314
00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:03.130

Tyler: So

319
00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:30.085
Tyler: just before that

320
00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:36.569
Tyler: did you? Did you notice anything any sort of like filter?

321
00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:39.410
> P6: [P6]. Here is your reminder.

322
00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:42.220
> P6: Town Hall meeting with District 3.

323
00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:44.930
> P6: Stop.

324
00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:47.860
Tyler: That's a good reminder.

325
00:30:58.323 --> 00:31:02.679
> P6: Alexis, so I have at least 10 more minutes.

326
00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:03.610
Tyler: Okay.

327
00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:09.199
Tyler: So I'd love for you to.

328
00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.490
> P6: Orient filters.

329
00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:11.609
Tyler: You did hear that. Okay.

330
00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:12.430
> P6: Yes.

331
00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:13.170
Tyler: Okay.

332
00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:15.349
Tyler: let's try and get back to that.

333
00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:35.800
Tyler: Okay.

334
00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:38.300
> P6: The filter.

335
00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:41.950
Tyler: Okay, so what? What exactly are these

336
00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:44.330
Tyler: films? This do.

337
00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:49.450
> P6: filters, filters.

338
00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:52.310
> P6: They give you the categories, and then

339
00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:54.520
> P6: they.

340
00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:57.490
> P6: I guess you could say, give subcategories.

341
00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:58.500
Tyler: Okay.

342
00:31:58.810 --> 00:31:59.680
Tyler: yeah.

343
00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:06.300
Tyler: Do you want to try and and filter the status so you could try and open this.

344
00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:07.310
> P6: Okay.

345
00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:27.559
> P6: So instead of

346
00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:33.480
> P6: instead of giving me the the filters, it's

347
00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:37.539
> P6: giving me the option to collect, to select all of them.

348
00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:38.560
Tyler: Okay.

349
00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:41.329
> P6: I know which filter to select.

350
00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:43.340
Tyler: Oh, okay.

351
00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:48.810
Tyler: so it's unclear how to select a a specific filter because it says all.

352
00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:50.110
> P6: Yes.

353
00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:56.529
Tyler: Yeah, yeah, I can see that right now. It looks like what's selected is all.

354
00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:01.449
Tyler: And so what you're saying is, it's not clear how to select something different to that.

355
00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:02.840
> P6: Right? It's okay.

356
00:33:03.130 --> 00:33:06.550
> P6: And it keeps saying, Dismiss contact menu.

357
00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:08.130
Tyler: Okay.

358
00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:10.090
> P6: Either reopen or dismiss.

359
00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:12.480
Tyler: Okay, reopened or dismissed. Okay.

360
00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:12.810
> P6: And.

361
00:33:13.133 --> 00:33:17.990
Tyler: Do you want to try one more time and see if we can hear, replied.

362
00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:19.780
> P6: Go back.

363
00:33:20.885 --> 00:33:23.470
Tyler: Just from where you are, I think if you yeah, there you.

364
00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:25.309
> P6: You hear? I do hear reply.

365
00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:26.100
Tyler: Okay?

366
00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.359
Tyler: And then, if you double tap.

367
00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:31.459
Tyler: would, are you able to to choose? Replied.

368
00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:33.209
> P6: Well, let me see.

369
00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:34.230
Tyler: Let's see.

370
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:38.280
> P6: Reply, button.

371
00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:39.940
Tyler: Okay.

372
00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:41.929
> P6: And filter by status.

373
00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:42.730
Tyler: Okay.

374
00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:47.409
Tyler: so what?

375
00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:50.630
Tyler: What do you think just happened?

376
00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:52.470
> P6: I'm at Sergeant.

377
00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:55.620
Tyler: What do you think just happened when you chose that.

378
00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:03.270
> P6: When it says filter by status, and then I I press reply.

379
00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:07.320
> P6: It's supposed to give me other options.

380
00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:09.169
Tyler: Okay, like, what?

381
00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:19.049
> P6: Other than status it could be. I don't know what I'm what I'm searching for, so I can't really think about what I'm trying. But

382
00:34:19.489 --> 00:34:21.559
> P6: if you filter by status.

383
00:34:22.209 --> 00:34:25.959
> P6: there gotta be other options to filter by. Also.

384
00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:28.030
> P6: That makes sense.

385
00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:35.481
Tyler: I think that makes sense. Let's say that you had submitted a question to the da, and and it was about

386
00:34:36.929 --> 00:34:39.020
Tyler: It was about id cards.

387
00:34:39.159 --> 00:34:52.830
Tyler: and you wanted to read what the the Va. Said back to you. What, what kind of thing would you try and search for? Would it be? Would it be a date? Would it be something else? What do you think you might search for.

388
00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:55.800
> P6: Well when it say replied I would click on that.

389
00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:56.610
Tyler: Okay.

390
00:34:56.610 --> 00:34:57.979
> P6: Give me my answer.

391
00:34:58.140 --> 00:34:59.010
Tyler: Okay.

392
00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:02.789
> P6: Yeah, let me see what was what the Va. Had to say about my question.

393
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:03.950
Tyler: Okay.

394
00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:06.917
Tyler: That makes sense.

395
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:09.895
Tyler: So let's go ahead and

396
00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:16.799
Tyler: and navigate down so we're going to try and find a question that was submitted on August 24th

397
00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:34.270
Tyler: [P6].

398
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:37.459
Tyler: Hmm! I just realized I gave you the wrong date.

399
00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:39.750
> P6: Oh, you tell my march right.

400
00:35:40.171 --> 00:35:42.278
Tyler: Yeah, that that's my fault.

401
00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:43.760
> P6: But August.

402
00:35:44.771 --> 00:35:53.370
Tyler: What what day was this question that you're currently that you're currently focused on? What day was this question submitted.

403
00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:56.779
> P6: The 8, th I believe.

404
00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:58.700
> P6: March 8.th

405
00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:03.930
> P6: Can I? Can I scroll back.

406
00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:04.700
Tyler: Of course. Yeah.

407
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:12.319
> P6: We haven't on March for.

408
00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:17.469
> P6: Oh, my word.

409
00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:22.360
> P6: march the 4, th

410
00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:26.490
> P6: updated on March 8.th

411
00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:28.370
> P6: It was a fine question.

412
00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.480
> P6: Am I going to a different question.

413
00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:39.010
Tyler: Yeah, that's what I was. Gonna ask you it it almost feels like it's not clear when you're moving between different questions. Do you think that's true?

414
00:36:39.010 --> 00:36:40.160
> P6: There should be

415
00:36:40.991 --> 00:36:43.399
> P6: ending to the first.st

416
00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:45.689
> P6: Beginning for the second.

417
00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:47.090
Tyler: Yeah.

418
00:36:47.090 --> 00:36:48.649
> P6: I can't tell. You know.

419
00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:52.420
> P6: Which question was answered on was submitted.

420
00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:55.790
Tyler: Yeah.

421
00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:57.540
Tyler: that makes sense.

422
00:36:58.670 --> 00:37:00.870
Tyler: I've noticed that a couple times

423
00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:03.040
Tyler: that.

424
00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:05.970
> P6: Sergeant.

425
00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:33.453
Tyler: I was just gonna say I've noticed that a couple of times that it's been a little unclear where a question begins, and the next question, sorry where a question ends, and the next question begins. So that's that makes complete sense. Especially as I observe you going through the page. I could probably ask you so many more questions, but I know we only have 4 min left together, so I do want to just take a moment to to chat before we finish up.

426
00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:48.700
Tyler: so we can leave your your screen up here. But we are all all finished with with testing the website, and I'm just curious for you. We've went through this website. It's something you've never you've never done before. How did you find that experience.

427
00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:54.240
> P6: Normally, if it's something that I've never done before and like I don't

428
00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:57.380
> P6: on my, I don't on my computer. I don't

429
00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:06.100
> P6: do search safari, because one don't really know how to use the computer well enough to do safari. And when I do get into it

430
00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:09.160
> P6: I don't know how to do the links.

431
00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:12.540
> P6: I've been kind of practicing on that.

432
00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:13.700
> P6: So

433
00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:16.509
> P6: I don't usually do the Internet on

434
00:38:16.970 --> 00:38:24.600
> P6: on my computer. If I do have to have something I use safari on my ipad, or something like that, and I dictate.

435
00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:27.040
Tyler: Okay, okay, just.

436
00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:29.950
> P6: Scrolling down until I get to

437
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:32.050
> P6: the answer that I need.

438
00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:54.329
Tyler: Gotcha. Okay? So you don't really you struggle with the links. But you do think that like often you might dictate a question and then try and find the answer. And do you think doing that like, for example, doing a Google search where you, you dictate your question, and then you try and find the answer. How would that compare to what we just did today? Which one is easier.

439
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:59.119
> P6: I'm dictating my and dictating looking for the answer.

440
00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:01.580
Tyler: Yeah. Why do you think that's easier?

441
00:39:02.099 --> 00:39:04.880
> P6: Well, for one I had never heard of. Ask

442
00:39:05.090 --> 00:39:06.569
> P6: X viable.

443
00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:08.810
> P6: I've never heard of that.

444
00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:11.909
> P6: Really doesn't seem like it's complicated.

445
00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:25.100
Tyler: Okay, so it doesn't seem complicated. But it seems, it still seems more simple for you to to Google search.

446
00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:32.470
> P6: As long as the answers. There's a space in between one answer and the next.

447
00:39:33.210 --> 00:39:35.679
> P6: Where you ask the question, you reply.

448
00:39:37.050 --> 00:39:37.960
Tyler: Yeah.

449
00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:40.920
> P6: Ask the next question, and you reply, you get the date.

450
00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:47.690
> P6: the date it was submitted, and the date it was replied to. That's a little confusing, because I couldn't tell.

451
00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:56.489
> P6: I had to keep going back and forth to find the date that it was submitted, and the date it was replied to it seemed like it was backwards.

452
00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:57.540
Tyler: Okay.

453
00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:58.980
Tyler: Gotcha.

454
00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:00.520
Tyler: So

455
00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:03.741
Tyler: it it felt like you were trying to

456
00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:27.380
Tyler: to figure out the date. It was submitted, and the date it was replied to, and you were also expecting to read the question, and then read the answer, yes, okay, yeah. That makes sense. And I think a really clear takeaway for me is that it needs to be more clear when you're when you're on question A, and now you're on question. B, so yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

### Cool down

Tyler: we've got a minute left. Do you have any questions for me? It could be about this research or about. You know, other research that's happening at the Va. Or or anything we talked about.

458
00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:45.000
> P6: Not really because I don't. Usually I have the reason I haven't responded to any of these.

459
00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:48.279
> P6: Studies is because it kept saying

460
00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:50.160
> P6: voice.

461
00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:52.870
> P6: what did you tell it to say?

462
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:54.150
Tyler: Voice, over.

463
00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:55.783
> P6: No, not voiceover, but voice

464
00:40:56.110 --> 00:40:57.770
Tyler: Voice, control.

465
00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:00.445
> P6: Record.

466
00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:03.270
> P6: I don't know how it was, how it was.

467
00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:03.740
Tyler: Hmm.

468
00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:10.320
> P6: Stated, but I kept saying, I have. I don't know what that is. I have no idea what that is. So I finally called and was.

469
00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:12.170
> P6: Simple voiceover.

470
00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:20.410
Tyler: Oh, okay. So they were saying, you know, we want to try and find people who use this type of technology and it and it.

471
00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:22.339
> P6: It kept saying, screen, reader.

472
00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:23.889
Tyler: Screen reader, gotcha.

473
00:41:23.890 --> 00:41:26.840
> P6: And I'm like, I don't use a screen, reader.

474
00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:31.590
> P6: not an Internet voiceover is considered a screen reader. Everything I do.

475
00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:34.430
> P6: I can't use any of this equipment, without

476
00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:36.829
> P6: voice over or voice, command.

477
00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:37.900
Tyler: Okay.

478
00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:44.820
Tyler: that that's really helpful feedback. So obviously, you're familiar with voice over. And the word screen, reader, just was not made.

479
00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:45.540
> P6: It wasn't.

480
00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:46.220
Tyler: Yeah.

481
00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:49.040
> P6: When they say a screen. Reader, I'm like, what is a screen, reader.

482
00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:52.209
Tyler: Yeah, that's I can see how that's confusing. Oh.

483
00:41:52.210 --> 00:41:52.780
> P6: Okay.

484
00:41:53.074 --> 00:42:21.675
Tyler: Yeah, no, that's not just you. And that's really helpful feedback, which I'm gonna let them know. Just so, you know, if you do happen upon that again, if they're asking for a screen, reader, a person who uses a screen reader, then a voice over would would apply so you could totally sign up for that research, and and on that note I've really appreciated you spending time with us today. I'm sorry we have to end a little bit early, but I think we got a lot of good information.

485
00:42:21.970 --> 00:42:23.010
> P6: Couldn't it.

486
00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:34.449
Tyler: Oh, good! Well, I really hope you sign up again in the future. Cause it's it's super helpful for us to figure out what's not working and how to make things better. So I hope you have a good rest of your day.

487
00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:39.169
> P6: You kind of encouraged me to go back in there and try to sign into my healthy bed again. Oh.

488
00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:54.149
Tyler: Yeah. Well, give it. Give it a try, and and I'll send I'll give perigee and a note to send you with the the Blind Veterans Association, because you might be able to reach out to somebody. If there's something specific that you can't figure out why it's not working, and they may be able to help.

489
00:42:54.370 --> 00:42:56.079
> P6: Okay, okay, what's that?

490
00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:58.800
Tyler: Awesome. Alright! Well, have a good one, [P6].

491
00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:00.400
> P6: You also be blessed.

492
00:43:00.610 --> 00:43:01.800
Tyler: All right, bye, bye.

493
00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:02.410
> P6: Bye, bye.
