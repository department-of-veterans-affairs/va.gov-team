### Warm up

Tyler: Okay. So the recording started. And I just wanna confirm, are you comfortable? If I record my screen and audio today.

> P13: It doesn't bother me.

Tyler: Okay, awesome. Do you have any questions for me? At this point.

> P13: Not yet.

Tyler: Great. Well, before we jump into testing this website, I'd love to just get a little bit of background about you and your experience with the Va. How long have you been a veteran?

> P13: Well.

> P13: I left the service in [1980's]. So, however long that's been.

Tyler: Okay. And did you start interacting with the Va right when you got out of service?

> P13: No.

> P13: you know, I did. Well, okay. So I went to a few medical clinics, but that was about, you know about it. And then I live in [location] now.

> P13: And so when I 1st moved here you know, started working with the Va. And you know for a long time they really wouldn't do anything for me. So I really wasn't you know, able to participate in a lot of stuff until I lost my sight and everything changed after that. So.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: Gotcha.

Tyler: So you weren't getting a lot of like support necessarily, or access to a lot of services.

> P13: Right.

Tyler: Until you lost your sight. And how long ago was that?

> P13: I became totally blind in 2010, so I lost an eye at a time. So left eye, 2009 right eye, 2010.

Tyler: Okay, Gotcha.

Tyler: And so have you been using voiceover or other sorts of assistive technology? I heard, maybe you have a braille keyboard. Right?

> P13: Right

Tyler: Have you been using that since like 2010?

> P13: No, I got my 1st iPhone in 2012.

> P13: And so that's

> P13: kind of when I started

> P13: well, using the iphone. So I'm assuming that was voice over. I was working with back. Then.

Tyler: yeah.

Tyler: that makes sense. And and you're using, are you using apple an apple computer as well.

> P13: Well, I have one.

> P13: But my my wife uses that I have a a macbook pro

> P13: but I couldn't use it. So basically I

> P13: Oh, let's just say, I gave it to her. So I have a I have a dell computer. And then I have a

> P13: huh!

> P13: It's called a braille note touch, plus. That's what I use a lot.

Tyler: Gotcha. Okay. Cool.

> P13: Yeah.

Tyler: And then your phone. Awesome.

Tyler: Okay, cool. Well, we're gonna talk a little bit more about voiceover on your phone today as we as we navigate this website.

Tyler: I do also wanna just check what browser do you usually use on your iphone.

> P13: My browser? Okay.

> P13: okay. I hate to sound stupid. But.

Tyler: No, no, it's not.

> P13: My memory. Browser. So what is it?

Tyler: Yeah, sorry. That's my fault. I should have given some examples. So safari is a common one on an iphone. Or you might be using Google chrome...

> P13: I gotta turn this thing [screen reader] off now.

> P13: I use actually, both of them. Depending.

Tyler: Okay.

> P13: I use safari and Google.

> P13: okay.

Tyler: Gotcha cool.

Tyler: alright. Well, the next thing that we're gonna do is we're gonna get set up sharing your screen on zoom.

Tyler: Have you ever done that before?

> P13: I think I have, but it's been so long. I don't use zoom hardly at all. So.

Tyler: That's totally fine. So I'll tell you a little bit about how it's gonna work before we get started. And just a reminder we've got SK here to support us as well.

Tyler: I know you've already dealt with a lot of technical annoyance this morning, so we'll try and hopefully keep that to a minimum.

Tyler: In a minute you'll navigate to the zoom controls. And you're gonna choose something that says share. And once you are on that, you're gonna choose, share screen.

> P13: Okay.

Tyler: Or it might say, start broadcasting.

Tyler: And this is basically so that I can see your screen as you navigate so I think you might have turned your voice over off. If you want to turn that back on and go ahead and get started. We're gonna navigate to share. And we're listening out for share screen.

> P13: Okay. So let's see if Siri will listen to me first. I'll try it that way.

Tyler: Okay.

> P13: Hey, siri, turn voice over on.

> P13: Okay, let me see.

> P13: Oh, she's talking so she's on.

> P13: So you want me to go to zoom after seeing if the voiceovers on right.

Tyler: Yes, yeah. Then we'll navigate to zoom.

> P13: Okay. Well, let me just see if she'll do it for me.

> P13: A siri open zoom!

> P13: Try it one more time.

> P13: hey? Siri?

> P13: Okay, so

> P13: she's not talking now. So

> P13: thank you.

> P13: Okay. So I got a question for you.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P13: Okay. So I went to the home screen.

Tyler: Okay.

> P13: So being that zoom

> P13: is up and running.

> P13: I mean, you want me to open zoom.

> P13: But it's already open.

Tyler: Okay, yeah, we just want Zoom to be in focus. So if you're in zoom, if you're currently in Zoom, then that's good.

> P13: So let me tap on it. Then see what happens. Then.

Tyler: Okay.

> P13: So let's see here.

> P13: Okay, so the only place I'm at is you know where it's giving me instructions as far as what to do with on this call video. So.

Tyler: Say that one more time.

> P13: Okay, so

> P13: zoom is on.

> P13: But it's just on, you know, far as the part that we are using right now, you know, on this call.

Tyler: So

Tyler: that's okay, that that makes sense. So now that we're at on zoom

Tyler: and I also should have said, earlier, we can't really hear your screen reader, and that's because you're on your phone. So if I'm if I'm being quiet, it's because I'm trying not to interrupt. If I interrupt, it's because I can't hear the screen reader so apologies in advance.

Tyler: SK, I saw you come off mute. Do you want to jump in here?

SK: Yeah. If you're on the instructions portion, [P13]. At this point you should be able to flick until you hear share content.

> P13: Okay, so let me do.

SK: Flick. I'm sorry. Flick right until you hear shared content.

> P13: Okay. So I'm on the share. So tap the share button.

SK: Go ahead and double, tap that.

SK: and then, as soon as you do that.

SK: flick right into the 1st option until you hear screen and double tap, screen.

> P13: Okay, double tap on screen.

SK: And then swipe right until you hear, start broadcast.

> P13: Okay, so.

SK: And then.

> P13: Oh.

> P13: can you see me now.

SK: Wonderful

SK: Yup. So to get rid of this little pop up, take 2 of your fingers at the bottom of the screen.

SK: swipe up and let go on that 1st vibration.

> P13: Alright!

> P13: Let's try it again.

SK: If that doesn't work, try one finger. This is a little bit tricky sometimes.

> P13: I don't know this one. This is usually pretty easy.

SK: So you're gonna do a kind of like a dragging motion with 2 fingers or one finger, just like

SK: yep, take it at the bottom of the screen and drag it across the screen, and then just let go on that 1st vibration. If not, we could try the app switcher.

SK: That worked. Okay, perfect.

Tyler: Perfect.

Tyler: Thank you, Sk.

SK: You're welcome.

> P13: So we did it right?

Tyler: Yes, yeah. Well done, yeah. So now, basically, I can see your screen. It just is telling me that you're sharing your screen. And we're on zoom, which is perfect. And the next thing we're gonna do is I'm gonna share a link to the website. That we're gonna test together. So I'm gonna share that in the chat on zoom.

Tyler: So when you're on the zoom window where you are right now. You're gonna navigate to some controls at the bottom and listen for 'chat.'

Tyler: And I'll send over the link now. And in the chat there's gonna be a link that you can open. Okay.

> P13: Okay, so.

SK: So on this, you're just you're gonna hear 'more.' You're gonna flick right until you hear more

SK: and then double, tap more.

> P13: Okay. So okay. So she's talking over you. If you said.

SK: Oh, I'm sorry. I keep forgetting. How can I forget?

SK: Okay.

SK: yeah. So go ahead and flick right until you hear more.

> P13: Okay.

> P13: okay, so I'm gonna tap on more.

SK: Yep. Double tap more.

> P13: All right.

SK: Oops!

Tyler: It's chat. We passed by the chat while we were trying to get to more.

> P13: Thanks.

SK: Thanks. Sorry about that. It's great.

> P13: Let me go back. Let's see.

Tyler: Yeah, you can click cancel here at the bottom. So if you keep going till you hear cancel.

> P13: Okay, so I'm going left or right.

Tyler: You're going right.

> P13: Okay.

> P13: Double tap on cancel.

Tyler: Perfect.

> P13: Okay.

Tyler: So now you're gonna go left until you hear chat.

> P13: Okay.

> P13: okay? So I'm gonna double tap on chat.

Tyler: Perfect.

> P13: Okay.

Tyler: So now you're in the chat and you're just gonna navigate. You can go right until you hear a link, and we'll open the link.

> P13: Okay.

> P13: Okay.

Tyler: Okay, perfect. So I think you'll be able to click on this link.

> P13: Just one second, ma'am. Okay. She stopped.

Tyler: Sorry.

Tyler: We're just gonna open this link now.

> P13: Okay. So

> P13: you just want me to tap on it again to open. It is what you're saying.

SK: You gotta flick right one more time to get on that link. Yeah.

> P13: Okay.

SK: And double. Tap it. Yep.

Tyler: Okay, perfect.

Tyler: So now we're on this page. And the next thing we're going to do is just navigate down

Tyler: to a button that's going to let us start the test. So we're going to listen to a heading that says research study. And once we get to that heading, let's pause.

> P13: Okay. So

> P13: okay. So

> P13: I'm sorry. But can you tell me what to do? One more time? I just.

Tyler: Totally fine. You're doing everything correctly. So we're just gonna keep going as you've been doing until you hear something that says, research study.

> P13: Okay, so.

> P13: hey.

Tyler: Okay.

> P13: Okay.

Tyler: Perfect. So now you're at this, we're gonna keep going right And there's gonna be a sign in button.

Tyler: So

Tyler: okay.

> P13: Okay.

> P13: tap on that button.

Tyler: Yes. Yeah.

> P13: Okay.

### Dashboard

Tyler: Awesome. Okay, we made it.  So we can just take a breather. You went through a lot of hoops and you've made it to where we want to begin.

Tyler: So let me tell you a little bit about what we're doing next. Okay, do you have any questions at this point before that?

> P13: No, ma'am, I'm.

Tyler: Okay, so we're going to observe as you navigate this website. And I want to share a little bit of context. So this is a tool called Ask Va. It's a way for veterans to contact the Va and ask a question online for today's session. We're going to pretend like you've recently asked the VA a question.

Tyler: and you've signed into your account to read the Va's reply to your question.

Tyler: And we're gonna go through a couple of different tasks, which I'll explain as we go. So you don't need to worry about remembering everything.

Tyler: And as you navigate we want to understand what's going through your mind and how your assistive technology is supporting you.

Tyler: When you're focused on a task, I'm going to do my best to stay quiet so you can obviously hear what the screen reader is announcing.

Tyler: And when you finish, or if you have a question, or if or anything like that, just pause, and we can, and we can chat about it.

> P13: Okay, so what I'm gonna do right now.

> P13: I need to see a brief moment.

> P13: I need to run to my restroom real quick.

Tyler: Yeah, no problem.

Tyler: Yeah, I'll see you in a couple of minutes when you're ready.

> P13: Okay. So let me set this down and over there.

[Pause]

Tyler: Hi there!

> P13: Okay, I'm back

> P13: awesome

> P13: stopped and got my cane so I can get around the house easier.

Tyler: Oh, good. Okay.

Tyler: Well, just let me know if you need another break for any reason. Okay.

Tyler: Awesome. So I told you a little bit about this tool, and kind of what we're gonna do today. And the last thing I wanted to share is that instead of making you sign in today. We're gonna pretend like you're signed into your account.

> P13: Okay.

Tyler: So this is your account. You're signed in on va.gov, okay?

Tyler: And so the 1st task that I'd like you to do is I'd like for you to orient yourself on this page. So you've just arrived at. Ask Va. And I'm gonna give you a couple of minutes to navigate around

245
00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:56.709
Tyler: And the one thing I'll ask is, if you're as you're navigating. If there's a a link or a button or something that you want to click on. Can you let me know before you click on it?

246
00:22:56.910 --> 00:22:57.530
> P13: Okay.

247
00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:04.720
Tyler: Okay, awesome. So I'm gonna give you a couple of minutes. Navigate around, and then afterwards we'll we'll just talk about what you found on this page.

248
00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:07.359
> P13: Alright. So let's see here.

249
00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.080
> P13: yeah.

250
00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:46.740
> P13: Okay.

251
00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:54.790
> P13: awesome.

252
00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:00.930
> P13: Okay.

253
00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:41.180
> P13: How do you think?

254
00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:47.670
> P13: Okay.

255
00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:51.460
> P13: okay.

256
00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:57.610
> P13: alright. So

257
00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:00.769
> P13: we have links here.

258
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.100
> P13: Come in.

259
00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:09.710
> P13: you know as a iphone users. There's sometimes they have buttons.

260
00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:13.500
> P13: I think they're kind of 2 different things. So.

261
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:16.630
> P13: And I know you mentioned buttons specifically.

262
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:18.540
Tyler: Okay. Yeah.

263
00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:22.570
> P13: So can we click on the links as well. I.

264
00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:35.019
Tyler: Yeah. So in a minute we definitely will click on a link. But I'm gonna I'm gonna wait a second. If that's okay. And what do you? What do you think would happen if we clicked on a link? Or are you just wondering? And that's why you want to click on it.

265
00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:35.870
> P13: Well.

266
00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:38.590
> P13: I think I know

267
00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:41.880
> P13: I like. So let me let me do this real quick.

268
00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:50.410
> P13: Okay? So when I click on a link.

269
00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:52.920
> P13: I mean.

270
00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:55.050
> P13: I think what it's just gonna do is

271
00:25:55.430 --> 00:26:00.329
> P13: take me to another page that hopefully is gonna provide that information.

272
00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:04.309
> P13: So that's what that's what I would be expecting to happen.

273
00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:08.959
Tyler: That makes sense. And when you say that information, what type of information.

274
00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:12.009
> P13: Well, okay. So in in this case, somebody.

275
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:15.620
> P13: you know, they just ask. They want to get their spouse an id card.

276
00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:17.680
> P13: And so

277
00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:25.160
> P13: that would be the information. If that was me. That's what I would be interested in finding out what steps to take

278
00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:27.189
> P13: for her to get an id card.

279
00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:28.920
Tyler: Gotcha. Okay.

280
00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:37.630
Tyler: that makes sense. So there's a link where you're gonna find more information. Hopefully, like an answer to the question that you've asked.

281
00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:42.999
Tyler: That makes sense. Okay, cool. What else did you find while you were navigating around this page?

282
00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:44.840
Tyler: Was anything confusing.

283
00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:48.109
> P13: Not really. Okay.

284
00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:49.320
Tyler: Yeah.

285
00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:50.720
Tyler: And so what?

286
00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:51.740
Tyler: Oh, go ahead.

287
00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:56.189
> P13: Let me just say this real quick. So sometimes you're gonna ask me questions. And

288
00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.989
> P13: even though I just read it.

289
00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:01.419
> P13: I'm not. Gonna remember, I'm gonna tell you now that my

290
00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:04.130
> P13: memory is jacked up.

291
00:27:05.045 --> 00:27:05.770
> P13: so

292
00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:10.829
> P13: I I might keep repeat, ask you to repeat it, but so just just let you know.

293
00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:11.510
Tyler: Fine.

294
00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:23.299
Tyler: Yeah, I appreciate you letting me know. That's perfectly fine, and I think for anybody it's a lot to remember. Probably all the things. I'll I'll say or ask you. So don't worry about repeating yourself.

295
00:27:23.647 --> 00:27:36.890
Tyler: And I also don't mind repeating myself. Okay, well, it looks like you've gotten a chance to navigate through. A lot of this page, and you told me a little bit about what's on the page like it sounds like there's some questions here.

296
00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:46.390
Tyler: awesome. So the next thing I'm I'm thinking we could do is there's a couple of questions on this page, and I'd like for you to find a question

297
00:27:46.400 --> 00:28:05.679
Tyler: that has a reply ready from the Va. So some of these questions might not have a reply, and some of them might have a reply. If you can just navigate and find one that has a reply, and again, we won't click on anything yet, but just like you did before. You can let me know when you're ready to to chat.

298
00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:06.790
> P13: Okay?

299
00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:12.250
> P13: Well, there's a reply for this question.

300
00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:14.049
Tyler: Okay. Cool.

301
00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:16.130
> P13: Like. See what it says right?

302
00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:18.804
Tyler: Well, so that's

303
00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:28.689
Tyler: That was quick for you to find that it obviously read aloud, replied, and when you say swipe to to find out more. You want to read the next line of content.

304
00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:32.518
> P13: Well, I I was thinking that

305
00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:35.980
> P13: that I was gonna read the reply.

306
00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:39.869
Tyler: Gotcha. Okay? So you're thinking, the reply will be, will come, next.

307
00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:42.460
Tyler: yeah.

308
00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:53.399
Tyler: that makes sense well, let's, why don't you go ahead, and again. We won't click on any like links yet, but go ahead and read what comes next, and we'll see if it matches what you expect.

309
00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:16.140
> P13: Okay. So

310
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.860
> P13: the next thing is actually.

311
00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:20.730
> P13: you know, after the reply.

312
00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:24.970
> P13: It's something different. So they're they're speaking about their

313
00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:28.900
> P13: other dependents, I take it. And

314
00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:32.300
> P13: he's having trouble navigating on the website.

315
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.420
> P13: And so it's a question that's been asked.

316
00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:37.870
Tyler: Gotcha.

317
00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:39.300
> P13: Not a reply to

318
00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.110
> P13: how to get my wife a Va. Car.

319
00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:56.259
Tyler: Gotcha. Okay, that makes so much sense. So you're going through the page. And you're hearing this question about getting your wife an id card, and then you hear replied, and so you're like, oh, the reply must be next right.

320
00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:56.670
> P13: Yeah.

321
00:29:56.670 --> 00:30:00.783
Tyler: That makes that makes total sense, and I can see why that would

322
00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:10.569
Tyler: like. Why, you would expect that. And also that that's not what's happened on this page. What do you think? Instead happened? What were we hearing about instead.

323
00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:15.540
> P13: Okay, well, let me ask this first.st

324
00:30:16.095 --> 00:30:16.650
Tyler: Yeah.

325
00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:18.610
> P13: So where it said reply.

326
00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:24.189
> P13: Was there something to tap on on that reply, where we could have got an answer.

327
00:30:24.936 --> 00:30:26.803
Tyler: That's a good question.

328
00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:35.080
Tyler: a lot of people have wondered if you can tap on the reply, do you did you think you could tap on it, or it's unclear.

329
00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:38.659
> P13: Well, I I it was unclear to me. I didn't think I could, because.

330
00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:39.180
Tyler: Yeah.

331
00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:41.079
> P13: Usually, when you can reply to something that

332
00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:45.519
> P13: just say button or link, or something.

333
00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:59.150
Tyler: Right? Gotcha. Okay, cool. Yeah. I mean, I'll let you know. So you can't actually click on that but like I said, a lot of other people have also wondered about like, is that something that I can click on to read the reply.

334
00:30:59.666 --> 00:31:02.690
Tyler: So I can see how that's not totally clear.

335
00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:17.439
Tyler: okay, so I want to move on just because I know we don't have a ton of time together. The next thing that I'm hoping we can do is try and find a question that's related to home loans and housing.

336
00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:20.509
> P13: Okay, so keep swiping.

337
00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:16.710
Tyler: Okay.

338
00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:23.489
> P13: Okay. So I'm I'm gonna go back a little bit because I think there was one that I could have tapped on.

339
00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:24.592
Tyler: Okay. Sounds good.

340
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.170
> P13: Let me see here.

341
00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:41.300
> P13: So how about on that?

342
00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:43.420
> P13: For va resources.

343
00:32:43.650 --> 00:32:52.469
Tyler: Okay, Gotcha. So we're not gonna click on it right now. But I'm wondering what? Why, what makes you think we should click on that, or that that might be a good option.

344
00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:54.380
> P13: Well, we're we're trying to find out.

345
00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:58.990
> P13: or if information about a home loan.

346
00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:01.219
> P13: A home loans so.

347
00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:05.760
> P13: You know. Do the resource page ticket.

348
00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:08.920
> P13: maybe. Tell us how to go about doing it.

349
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:19.409
Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. So you're like, I'm I'm looking for information about this thing. It hasn't yet been mentioned on this page. So maybe I should navigate here to find it somewhere else.

350
00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:20.050
> P13: Great.

351
00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:31.800
Tyler: That makes sense. While you were navigating, if you go left a little bit further. I heard something or I saw something, and you probably heard something that said

352
00:33:32.311 --> 00:33:35.920
Tyler: like page one, page 2. Do you remember that.

353
00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:36.919
> P13: Yes, I do.

354
00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:49.759
Tyler: Okay, and you went past. So I think you went. You heard page 2, and then you kept going past that is there any reason you did that? Or you think you were just trying to get like a lay of the land.

355
00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:51.880
> P13: Don't know, because I I was

356
00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:54.470
> P13: listening to everything that

357
00:33:56.170 --> 00:33:56.870
> P13: oh.

358
00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:59.049
> P13: that that it was telling us.

359
00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:01.110
> P13: And even though

360
00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:03.370
> P13: it was different pages

361
00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:05.290
> P13: pie

362
00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:07.480
> P13: probably be a good idea to

363
00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:09.721
> P13: go through this page one.

364
00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:12.709
> P13: Before I jump to page 2.

365
00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:13.439
Tyler: Yeah, that.

366
00:34:13.449 --> 00:34:15.909
> P13: So, yeah, so that's why

367
00:34:16.039 --> 00:34:17.549
> P13: I just kept on going.

368
00:34:17.829 --> 00:34:20.709
> P13: Because if you start jumping from page to page.

369
00:34:21.069 --> 00:34:23.959
> P13: it's just tend to get messed up and take a long time.

370
00:34:24.839 --> 00:34:29.059
> P13: especially if you don't find the information that you were looking from.

371
00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:38.524
Tyler: Gotcha. Yeah, that's really smart. So you didn't want to get off of page one when you hadn't even finished reviewing all of it. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay,

372
00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:40.050
Tyler: So

373
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:49.540
Tyler: let's go back up. All the way, kind of to the top of the page. So when we hear your questions, that heading. Maybe we can stop there.

374
00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:53.260
> P13: So you go to the copy, paste.

375
00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:57.620
Tyler: We'll go left. Yeah, we'll we'll just keep going left until we hear your questions.

376
00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:37.840
> P13: It's true.

377
00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:41.300
> P13: So you wanted me to go back to the question.

378
00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:43.749
Tyler: Yeah, that works So

379
00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:51.869
Tyler: let's go a little bit further up so we'll go keep going left, and I want to listen out, for if we hear anything like that, says Filter.

380
00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:17.100
> P13: Yeah, there's filter.

381
00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:20.350
Tyler: Okay, cool. So what? What is that filter.

382
00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:22.279
> P13: I don't have a clue.

383
00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:26.410
Tyler: Okay, yeah, that's fair. And

384
00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:33.040
Tyler: there's is there any other filter, or any other way of kind of organizing your questions? Besides this one.

385
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:40.470
> P13: Okay, so how to organize the question? I'm not sure I know what you.

386
00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:48.190
Tyler: Yeah, that's okay. That's okay. Let's see if there's any other filter. So there's this filter that we're currently focused on.

387
00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:53.049
Tyler: let's just see if there's any other filter on this page.

388
00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:55.760
> P13: Okay, so let's see here.

389
00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:01.499
> P13: just one more time back to the right.

390
00:37:12.210 --> 00:37:13.040
> P13: Okay.

391
00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:23.979
> P13: alright. So there was another filter filter, you know, there's 2 of them.

392
00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:25.620
> P13: Okay, yeah.

393
00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:37.549
Tyler: Yeah, 2 different filters. And when I when I 1st said, You know, what is that filter, or how does that work? Or whatever you said, sort of like, I have no idea. Do you think you would just end up not using these.

394
00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:39.230
> P13: Filter.

395
00:37:40.210 --> 00:37:40.970
Tyler: Well, it's.

396
00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:45.319
> P13: Let me if I could figure out what it's for. It sounds like.

397
00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:48.019
Tyler: Now, what does it sound like?

398
00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:49.524
> P13: It just sounds like

399
00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:55.920
> P13: I guess you know, like, if you're on a page, there could be a lot of stuff on there for lack of better word.

400
00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:57.670
> P13: And so

401
00:37:59.570 --> 00:38:01.609
> P13: it looks like it's gonna

402
00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:06.599
> P13: I don't know. Focus on a particular area and leave other stuff that

403
00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:09.520
> P13: don't need to be there out. So.

404
00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:10.080
Tyler: Okay.

405
00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:12.079
> P13: I don't know if I explained it the right way, but.

406
00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:13.759
Tyler: No, that makes a lot of sense.

407
00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:22.520
Tyler: Yeah. So some way of focusing on certain things, and then kind of hiding other things that are that you're not looking for at that time.

408
00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:23.080
> P13: Right.

409
00:38:23.410 --> 00:38:30.669
Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. And you said there was 2 filters. Do you remember what the different filters were for?

410
00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:33.890
> P13: Okay. So one was filter by category.

411
00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:35.250
> P13: Yeah.

412
00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:38.050
> P13: like, I said, my memory is bad. I don't.

413
00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:38.510
Tyler: Yeah.

414
00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:40.919
> P13: With this, but I could flip back to it.

415
00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:45.660
Tyler: That's okay. Why don't we go to filter by category first, st and we'll talk about that one for a second.

416
00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:50.900
> P13: Okay, so.

417
00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:51.350
Tyler: Okay.

418
00:38:51.350 --> 00:38:51.980
> P13: Button.

419
00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:53.539
Tyler: Yeah, let's open it

420
00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:00.830
Tyler: and and go ahead and navigate through this.

421
00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:04.739
> P13: I'm sorry. Say it one more time.

422
00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:11.500
Tyler: Oh, just go ahead and and navigate through these this list, so you can get a better understanding of what this filter has.

423
00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:31.320
> P13: So

424
00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:33.010
> P13: well.

425
00:39:34.490 --> 00:39:36.980
> P13: It gives the answer to that question.

426
00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:42.489
> P13: When you asked me about find out how to find out about home phones and stuff like that.

427
00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:43.870
Tyler: Okay. Gotcha.

428
00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:46.080
> P13: Answered, here in this filter, so.

429
00:39:46.290 --> 00:39:48.800
Tyler: Yeah. So that's 1 way to find the question

430
00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:50.860
Tyler: about a certain topic.

431
00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:51.350
> P13: Right.

432
00:39:51.792 --> 00:39:53.120
Tyler: That makes sense.

433
00:39:53.150 --> 00:40:06.109
Tyler: Okay, let's say that you wanted to find a question that was just about id cards. I know you've already found that question. But let's say you wanted to use the filter and just find questions that are about id cards. Can you show me how you would do that?

434
00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:09.460
> P13: Okay. So first, st let me make sure I'm in the right filter.

435
00:40:09.590 --> 00:40:11.619
> P13: So let's swipe that

436
00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:13.359
> P13: as I try to get out of here.

437
00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:13.950
Tyler: Okay.

438
00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:15.339
> P13: Work my way to the top.

439
00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:24.070
> P13: Okay, so said Veteran Id Card. So I would tap on that.

440
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.900
Tyler: Okay.

441
00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:26.830
Tyler: you can go ahead and tap.

442
00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:31.750
Tyler: Okay, awesome.

443
00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:37.590
Tyler: So now that you've you've tapped on that based on what you said to me earlier. You're expecting that.

444
00:40:37.963 --> 00:40:42.809
Tyler: The questions on this page are now just gonna be about veteran id cards right.

445
00:40:42.970 --> 00:40:43.540
> P13: Right.

446
00:40:43.830 --> 00:40:50.040
Tyler: Okay, cool. Let's go find the 1st question on this page. Now that you've filtered.

447
00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:03.370
> P13: You search.

448
00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:10.400
> P13: Okay? So just asking a question, real quick.

449
00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:11.500
> P13: So

450
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:15.639
> P13: it says, a filter by status

451
00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:18.250
> P13: so

452
00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:22.940
> P13: does that play a role in what I'm trying to do right now.

453
00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:32.899
Tyler: Well, that's a good question. So there's obviously we did filter by category. And now there's filter by status. What do you think? Filter by status would would do.

454
00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:43.769
Tyler: And if if you're not sure, it's okay to kind of open, you can open the filter, and we can see what's in there.

455
00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:06.609
> P13: Okay. So

456
00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:08.780
> P13: to me it ain't much here.

457
00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:10.780
Tyler: Okay. And why is that.

458
00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:13.600
> P13: Well, I mean the

459
00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:17.259
> P13: just ain't explain. Just not a lot. There.

460
00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:20.459
> P13: please, right now.

461
00:42:20.590 --> 00:42:21.390
Tyler: Yeah.

462
00:42:21.390 --> 00:42:26.289
> P13: I wouldn't see what benefit I would get from it. You know, as far as what we're trying to do now.

463
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:27.999
> P13: you know, about

464
00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:30.709
> P13: trying to get an Id or anything else. So.

465
00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:32.119
Tyler: Okay, gotcha. So.

466
00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:33.569
> P13: Sure it serves a purpose.

467
00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:34.510
> P13: but

468
00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:35.820
> P13: it is.

469
00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:40.480
> P13: and it would perhaps help me down the road. But it it wouldn't help me right now.

470
00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:56.450
Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense in this scenario that we're in. It doesn't help to to use this filter. And I can totally see why that's the case. Yeah, okay, cool. Well, let's just go ahead and and we'll close out of this filter so you can.

471
00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:01.110
Tyler: You can go back. Or you might be. You can also probably just select all.

472
00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:03.020
> P13: So let's see here.

473
00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:08.260
> P13: Okay, so I'm gonna select all button.

474
00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:08.890
Tyler: Okay.

475
00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:19.259
Tyler: perfect. So I do want to check in about the time. It's now 11 Am. Eastern time, which I think might be 10 am. For you.

476
00:43:20.046 --> 00:43:24.430
Tyler: I'm wondering if it's possible for us to chat for like 10 more minutes.

477
00:43:24.610 --> 00:43:25.420
> P13: Sure.

478
00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:26.330
Tyler: Is that? Okay?

479
00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:27.730
Tyler: Okay, great.

480
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:35.059
Tyler: Alright. So and it. And it might even be sooner than that. But there's 1 more thing I want to try and and see if we can go through together. So

481
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:41.329
Tyler: we've now filtered this page, and it's all questions about id cards and what I'd like you to do is

482
00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:46.810
Tyler: is navigate to a question that was submitted on August 24.th

483
00:43:47.290 --> 00:43:53.250
Tyler: And then, once you get there, you can go ahead and and click on that link that you asked me if you could click on earlier.

484
00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:54.710
> P13: Okay. So

485
00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:49.970
> P13: okay, so

486
00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:51.560
> P13: a second.

487
00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:53.975
> P13: okay, oh, okay. So

488
00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:55.969
> P13: I went to that.

489
00:44:56.070 --> 00:44:58.019
> P13: you know. August 24.th

490
00:44:58.020 --> 00:44:58.680
Tyler: Yeah.

491
00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:02.949
> P13: But there's really nothing. There's no link or button to tap.

492
00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:04.690
Tyler: Gotcha. Okay?

493
00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:13.270
Tyler: And I saw you. You were going back and forth between August 24th and you were. And there was something saying reopened, and you were trying to figure out kind of where to click.

494
00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:14.830
> P13: Yes. Yeah.

495
00:45:14.830 --> 00:45:21.309
Tyler: That makes sense. Okay, I can completely see why that's the case, especially with what we already talked about earlier.

496
00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:30.329
Tyler: let's we're gonna swipe left a couple of times and we're gonna try and listen out for something that says, check details.

497
00:45:53.110 --> 00:45:53.920
> P13: Okay.

498
00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:55.050
Tyler: Okay.

499
00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:56.720
> P13: You want me to click on the leak.

500
00:45:56.950 --> 00:46:08.580
Tyler: Yeah. But before we do that, just one question. So this this link here? It. It has kind of a long description, let's say, and then at the very end, it says, Link, right.

501
00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:12.770
Tyler: do you think? Do you think you skipped past it because of that? Maybe.

502
00:46:16.649 --> 00:46:19.601
> P13: I don't know. Let me swipe over again.

503
00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:21.050
Tyler: Okay. No worries.

504
00:46:21.050 --> 00:46:24.489
> P13: See, let's see here.

505
00:46:32.805 --> 00:46:35.300
> P13: I I don't know. I guess

506
00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:40.450
> P13: I don't know. I don't think there was enough information there.

507
00:46:40.450 --> 00:46:42.130
Tyler: Hmm, okay. It might not.

508
00:46:42.130 --> 00:46:43.859
> P13: Need to want to click on it if.

509
00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:45.660
Tyler: yeah.

510
00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:47.580
Tyler: So

511
00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:53.400
Tyler: if you wanted to find the answer to this question that you've submitted

512
00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:57.349
Tyler: what what kind of link would you listen out for.

513
00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:58.920
Tyler: or or heading.

514
00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:00.680
Tyler: What do you think it might say?

515
00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:05.519
> P13: Okay, so let me refresh my memory. So right now we are looking for

516
00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:11.240
> P13: information on how to get my wife an Id, or are we looking for.

517
00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:12.449
Tyler: That's right. That's right.

518
00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:12.980
> P13: Okay.

519
00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:30.789
Tyler: And and really, what we're wondering is, we've asked this question to the Va. About how to get my wife an Id card, but I don't know where the answer is, and so we're trying to figure out where the answer is on this page, or or maybe on a link.

520
00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:34.670
> P13: Okay, so.

521
00:47:37.490 --> 00:47:38.219
> P13: oh, wow.

522
00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:43.109
Tyler: Say that one more time.

523
00:47:43.110 --> 00:47:45.599
> P13: I don't know, so let let me say this because.

524
00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:46.300
Tyler: Yeah.

525
00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:48.730
> P13: My wife has an id. Okay.

526
00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:50.650
Tyler: Yeah.

527
00:47:50.650 --> 00:47:52.490
> P13: And we we

528
00:47:53.310 --> 00:47:55.350
> P13: did it recently. So

529
00:47:57.060 --> 00:48:00.770
> P13: try to make a long story short. So I'm a 100%,

530
00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:04.369
> P13: you know, disable the rating or whatever.

531
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:09.550
> P13: I actually called the American Legion.

532
00:48:10.210 --> 00:48:13.099
> P13: Didn't they help me to navigate.

533
00:48:13.950 --> 00:48:17.330
> P13: And then we have a reserve base here in my hometown.

534
00:48:17.710 --> 00:48:21.029
> P13: So it was just kind of like one thing led to another.

535
00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:23.670
> P13: I think in the end

536
00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:26.130
> P13: that my wife

537
00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:28.680
> P13: she had to do it because I couldn't.

538
00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:32.689
> P13: I think she went to va.gov, or whatever.

539
00:48:33.350 --> 00:48:36.990
> P13: And they helped her out from there, and that's all I can tell you.

540
00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:39.990
> P13: I don't know anything else about it after that, so.

541
00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:42.390
Tyler: Yeah, no, that makes sense.

542
00:48:42.890 --> 00:48:54.860
Tyler: that. That's that's really helpful context. And also it's helpful for me. Because what we're trying to understand is, if somebody, if a veteran was on this page, would they be able to fit, find

543
00:48:54.880 --> 00:49:09.160
Tyler: how to get to the reply from the Va. So the Va. Has replied to your question, is it easy to get to the reply? And I think it's not that simple? Is what I'm noticing. Does that feel fair to say. It's not that simple to get to the reply.

544
00:49:09.690 --> 00:49:14.180
> P13: Right. But but what I mean, what I would like to know, anyway, is.

545
00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:14.810
Tyler: Yeah.

546
00:49:14.810 --> 00:49:15.630
> P13: Okay

547
00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:16.950
> P13: Assembly.

548
00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:21.870
> P13: Are we just dealing with blind people or not? Because I think sighted people.

549
00:49:23.350 --> 00:49:25.110
> P13: Yeah, I think it would be different.

550
00:49:26.065 --> 00:49:28.719
> P13: maybe not in all cases. But a lot of times

551
00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:30.929
> P13: have sight alone.

553
00:49:32.890 --> 00:49:34.320
> P13: Big big difference.

554
00:49:34.530 --> 00:49:46.910
Tyler: Yeah, I totally agree. That's why we are doing research with folks who are sighted and folks who are blind. So we can make sure that this page works well for people regardless of the way they're using it.

555
00:49:47.478 --> 00:49:59.711
Tyler: And so with a screen, reader, you're you're using this page differently than myself, as a sighted person might use it. So that's why we're chatting to you. It makes sense to me that it might be different for different folks.

556
00:50:00.170 --> 00:50:06.240
Tyler: let's why don't we do this? We've we've only got like a a couple more minutes and so

557
00:50:07.490 --> 00:50:16.279
Tyler: I wanna just try and do one more thing. Let's let's navigate to that that link that says, check details. And then we'll go ahead and click on the link.

558
00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:19.089
> P13: Alright. So let me see, which way did I go?

559
00:50:19.690 --> 00:50:20.530
> P13: I'm gonna go back.

560
00:50:20.530 --> 00:50:22.119
Tyler: You're gonna go left. Yeah.

561
00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:29.610
Tyler: okay? So.

562
00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:33.110
> P13: Did you say so?

563
00:50:33.110 --> 00:50:40.800
Tyler: Yeah, sorry. I just wanted to make sure. I I stopped you so we can go right from here. Actually, that might have been my fault.

564
00:50:53.970 --> 00:50:56.010
> P13: Alright. So I'm gonna double tap on it.

565
00:50:56.010 --> 00:50:56.870
Tyler: Perfect.

566
00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:02.440
Tyler: Okay?

### Details page

Tyler: So now we're on this page, and I want you to just do one task on this page, which is to find the reply from the Va. So I'll give you a minute to find the reply from the Va.

568
00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:16.129
> P13: Okay. So let's see here.

569
00:51:53.043 --> 00:51:57.070
> P13: Okay. So I'm gonna tell you right here.

570
00:51:59.130 --> 00:52:00.110
> P13: Think I've gotten

571
00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:01.006
> P13: just here.

572
00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:03.859
Tyler: You said you've you've gotten confused here.

573
00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:04.800
> P13: Yeah.

574
00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:05.450
Tyler: Yeah.

575
00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:11.719
> P13: So let me go back because we're looking for. Check the details on the reply. Right

576
00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:12.910
> P13: or no.

577
00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:19.529
Tyler: Yeah. So we've gotten to this page. You clicked on the check details, link. And now we're looking for the reply from the Va.

578
00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:32.950
Tyler: And I watched you navigate, and you went through a couple of different parts of a conversation. Does that sound familiar? And so? And I think what we want to listen out for is, when did the Va.

579
00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:34.900
Tyler: Send you a reply?

580
00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:36.210
> P13: So

581
00:52:36.450 --> 00:52:38.369
> P13: okay, I'm gonna go back for a little bit.

582
00:52:38.370 --> 00:52:38.650
Tyler: Yeah.

583
00:52:38.650 --> 00:52:40.559
> P13: Here what I'm looking for now.

584
00:52:41.710 --> 00:52:43.000
> P13: T. To go right.

585
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:44.210
Tyler: Sounds good.

586
00:52:50.410 --> 00:52:51.299
> P13: I'm doing more

587
00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:11.200
> P13: frustrating.

588
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.910
> P13: Okay? So that might be it right there.

589
00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:25.930
Tyler: Got it. Okay.

590
00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:28.729
> P13: So do you want me to tap on it?

591
00:53:29.502 --> 00:53:40.939
Tyler: It's up to you. This is that was kind of the last thing I wanted us to try and do and I could tell that it could be a little simpler for you to find that reply from the Va

592
00:53:41.339 --> 00:53:52.129
Tyler: this is an assumption that I'm making, but I I assume part of it is, it's you're listening to a lot of information before it says, response from Va, right?

593
00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:53.810
Tyler: Okay, yeah.

594
00:53:54.293 --> 00:53:58.996
Tyler: So I think that's also what's making it a little tricky to find that reply.

### Cool down

Tyler: you've been super super helpful. Thomas and I were crossing our fingers that we might have one more chance to meet with somebody using a screen, reader, because we've seen a couple of the issues that you've noticed today. But having one more person go through them and find the same issues, makes us feel more confident in in the problems we need to fix.

596
00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:20.500
> P13: Okay.

597
00:54:20.749 --> 00:54:28.239
Tyler: So I really appreciate it. I do want to give you a chance. Is there anything you wanted to share with us about that experience before we, we wrap up.

598
00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:32.360
> P13: Well, I I will say this, and it's you know, concerning

599
00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:35.910
> P13: myself. I I think one thing

600
00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:38.819
> P13: as a screen reader.

601
00:54:39.100 --> 00:54:41.379
> P13: that you know that we could do

602
00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:46.079
> P13: cause we actually cause I I wouldn't have missed that if I would

603
00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:48.279
> P13: slow down and listen.

604
00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:51.040
> P13: To, you know, to the whole thing.

605
00:54:51.350 --> 00:54:55.219
> P13: cause I think what happens a lot of times we hear a little bit.

606
00:54:56.050 --> 00:55:00.510
> P13: If it's not right there in the beginning, we, too, tend to zoom right past.

607
00:55:01.730 --> 00:55:02.060
Tyler: Okay.

608
00:55:02.060 --> 00:55:04.880
> P13: Information that might have our answer.

609
00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:09.560
> P13: Although I I think, and I know I'm not the only one that does that.

610
00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:13.039
> P13: So I mean, we gotta do our part, too.

611
00:55:13.330 --> 00:55:19.319
> P13: and that slow down and actually listen to what's being said. Study, hearing a few words and

612
00:55:19.650 --> 00:55:21.230
> P13: zoom past it.

613
00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:22.240
Tyler: Yeah.

614
00:55:22.410 --> 00:55:31.957
Tyler: Yeah. And I hear you on that for sure. I think that's you know you could say the same for a sighted person who's zooming through the page. And and they're saying, I can't find this. And you're like you went so quickly.

615
00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:38.619
Tyler: But but I think also it's really helpful for us, because there's certain things we might be able to say.

616
00:55:38.660 --> 00:55:44.260
Tyler: You know, this is the most important thing. Let's put this first, st because if somebody is going quickly.

617
00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:53.110
Tyler: Then they'll hear that first.st So, regardless of how you, you know, went quickly or not, it's still helpful for us to to understand.

618
00:55:54.490 --> 00:56:01.870
Tyler: and yeah, probably all of us could slow down a little bit. We're we're just on. We're using so much technology going so quickly. So

619
00:56:01.930 --> 00:56:03.407
Tyler: it makes sense.

620
00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:09.380
Tyler: Do you have any questions for me at this point? I know it's your 1st time doing research with the Va.

621
00:56:10.290 --> 00:56:11.439
> P13: Oh, no.

622
00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:14.159
> P13: you know I feel kind of kind of happy because I

623
00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:17.102
> P13: I didn't think it was gonna go this smooth. To be honest with you.

624
00:56:17.810 --> 00:56:19.020
Tyler: Good.

625
00:56:19.020 --> 00:56:21.470
> P13: You know, turned out pretty good. I feel

626
00:56:21.930 --> 00:56:25.239
> P13: I feel very confident if I if I do this again.

627
00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:25.930
Tyler: Yeah.

628
00:56:25.930 --> 00:56:26.890
> P13: Worked out.

629
00:56:27.370 --> 00:56:38.970
Tyler: Awesome. I I would I think you should definitely feel confident you were like, I'm not just saying this. Such a trooper, and like being patient through that 1st hour of just trying to get set up. Because I know that's not

630
00:56:39.641 --> 00:56:44.848
Tyler: it's not simple. It's we see that for a lot of different participants. And

631
00:56:45.700 --> 00:57:10.244
Tyler: and it's not simple for me to try and help you either. I know we had to have someone else call you on the phone. So anyways, you did, you did a great job just staying patient and getting through all that. And I think the next time you join a session. All of that will feel maybe more familiar for you. So I really appreciate it. I can't tell you how helpful this is for folks like us at the Va. So I hope you keep taking part in research.

632
00:57:10.530 --> 00:57:19.279
Tyler: the next step is when we finish this session. The folks who set up the research session from Perigean.

633
00:57:19.559 --> 00:57:33.710
Tyler: They're going to send you a thank you note. It's gonna have some information you can pass on to other veterans if they'd like to take part in research and they are also the ones who are gonna pay you for joining the session. So if you have any questions, you just let them know. Okay.

634
00:57:33.910 --> 00:57:35.099
> P13: Alright, no problem.

635
00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:41.989
Tyler: Alright. Well, I really appreciate you taking the time with us today. I know we went a little over, so I hope you get a little break.

636
00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:42.840
> P13: Look now.

637
00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:44.709
> P13: Awesome. All right.

638
00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:46.290
Tyler: Have a good rest of your day. Okay.

639
00:57:46.290 --> 00:57:47.969
> P13: Okay, you, too. Alright! Bye.

640
00:57:47.970 --> 00:57:48.590
Tyler: Bye.
