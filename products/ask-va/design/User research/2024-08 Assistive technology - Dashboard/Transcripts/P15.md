195
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.229

196
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:40.340
Thomas: Yeah, okay.

197
00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:42.219
Thomas: no, that makes sense.

198
00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:48.679
Thomas: one of the other things that I just kind of like to know is like, as you kind of look at the the content on this page.

199
00:14:49.102 --> 00:14:58.510
Thomas: Is there anything else like besides the check details, and maybe like submitted on what other information. Do you see here? That

200
00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:04.079
Thomas: might, you know, be helpful or confusing, or anything else you'd like to let me know.

201
00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:07.079
> P15: Well, I was wondering about that. It says

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:11.690

204

> P15: Oh.

205
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.229
> P15: that might be, all right. But what if I'd submitted to

206
00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:20.480

207
00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:24.043

210
00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:35.309

212
00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:44.680
Thomas: Okay. So if you had 2 if you had more than one question that had the same category, having something like a sub

213
00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.520
Thomas: topic or sub something.

214
00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.149

216
00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:50.920
Thomas: Yeah.

217
00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:54.659
> P15: I can't remember what date you actually did it on. That's the problem.

218
00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:55.420
Thomas: Okay.

219
00:15:55.690 --> 00:16:13.319
Thomas: that's a really good, really good point [P15]. What I'd like for you to do for just a moment. [P15] is if you scroll down the page just a moment because, you see, does you? Said disability, compensation, and veteran Id card here on this one. But you notice that there was you. You scroll down the page and saw some additional questions right.

220
00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.100
> P15: Yes.

221
00:16:14.437 --> 00:16:19.499
Thomas: Could you just take a moment and look at those 2 questions down below?

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:40.970
Thomas: Right.

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:42.370
> P15: Dates.

228
00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:46.050

229

Thomas: Okay.

230
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:48.419
> P15: Yeah, that's what I was talking about. It's.

231
00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:54.509
Thomas: Okay, is there anything else that could help to differentiate between these 2 questions?

232
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.840

233

234

235
00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:27.500

243
00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:47.460
Thomas: No way. That's funny. That's crazy.

244
00:17:48.147 --> 00:17:50.535
Thomas: We didn't plan that.

245
00:17:52.100 --> 00:18:01.750
Thomas: but it it is a it is a nice, happy accident. So you mentioned? How can I view my dependence? Information? What in that

246
00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:10.364
Thomas: that text? Right there, in these 2 questions that have the same category. What are we reading? In terms of

247
00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:13.559
Thomas: that text? Below the category there.

248
00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:18.750
> P15: Oh, Wilkesburg.

249
00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:20.898

250

251
00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.600

252
00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:26.230

255
00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:37.055
Thomas: Oh, that's okay. No, I mean, it makes sense. I mean, yeah, you didn't. You know

256
00:18:37.873 --> 00:18:43.456
Thomas: you didn't put the questions in you're just kind of like kind of orienting yourself to the page.

257
00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:44.070
> P15: Yes.

258
00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:48.120
Thomas: So if there wasn't a sub topic.

259
00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:50.469
Thomas: those questions might help

260
00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:52.180
Thomas: to differentiate.

261
00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:53.319
Thomas: You were saying.

262
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.830

263
00:18:55.880 --> 00:19:01.740

264
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:04.819

265
00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:17.522
Thomas: Okay, no, that makes sense. Right? That's good to know. And it's great that you brought up. You were the 1st person to bring up. What if there were 2 categories that had the same categories? So that was, I'm very thankful that

266
00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:31.330
Thomas: Tyler had the foresight to to having 2 2 questions on there with the same categories. So kudos, I gotta. I gotta give kudos to to Tyler on that one. So

267
00:19:32.008 --> 00:19:35.221
Thomas: let me ask you this is that

268
00:19:36.206 --> 00:19:39.700
Thomas: you? You see these these categories? The questions.

269
00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:46.209
Thomas: Could you find a question for me that has a that you think that might have a reply from the Va.

Thomas: Yeah.

278
00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:37.310
Thomas: So let me ask you this. As you've kind of gone through this page. Did that seem? Does that seem intuitive in terms of you. See these words inside these little gray rectangles, replied, in progress reopened.

279
00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.022
Thomas: Do you know,

280
00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:43.079
Thomas: what are we kind of looking at here. What? What do you think these mean?

281

282

294
00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:44.090

295
00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:46.010

Thomas: Okay.

301
00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:07.790

303
00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:21.500
Thomas: Is there another way that you could have found? If a card

304
00:22:21.817 --> 00:22:26.590

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:26.960

333
00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:31.530

Thomas: Okay, all right.

343
00:25:06.837 --> 00:25:15.609

344
00:25:16.162 --> 00:25:32.920
Thomas: So let's say, if I asked you to find a question that is, you know, within the these these questions that we've pretended that you submitted. Let's say, if I asked you to find a question that's related to home loans, how would you find that question.

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:07.300
> P15: microphone. Off.

351
00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:19.789
> P15: I am assuming without clicking on it. I would go into filter by category, and hopefully there'd be a category under there for home loans.

352
00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:23.279
Thomas: Do you wanna try that filter and see if that helps.

353
00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:24.640
> P15: Microphone on

354
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:27.170

> P15: No, it's quick

357
00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:49.850
> P15: microphone off.

358
00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:54.660
> P15: Yeah. That helps. I'd go down to

359
00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:57.219
> P15: housing assistance and home loans.

360
00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:58.760
Thomas: Alright fantastic.

361
00:26:59.835 --> 00:27:00.800
Thomas: So

362
00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:09.839
Thomas: that would be one way that you said that you could potentially find that that question. Did that seem to make sense of using the filter that way.

363
00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:13.200
> P15: Yes, if I knew it was a

364
00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:15.279
> P15: under a certain category.

365
00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:16.110
Thomas: Okay. Alright!

366
00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:18.890
> P15: If I'd remembered. Oh, yeah, okay, it's under this.

367
00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:21.082
> P15: To probably have more

368
00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:25.590
> P15: in your actual page would probably be more categories select from. But.

369
00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.630
> P15: Now, there's only 4 categories there that

370
00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.550
> P15: if you had a question that

371
00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:38.499
> P15: didn't fit one of those categories, I'm not sure what you would do.

372
00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:39.377
Thomas: Okay, all right.

373
00:27:40.354 --> 00:27:46.289
Thomas: So would you expect? Let let's say for the questions that you've asked.

374
00:27:46.775 --> 00:27:58.010
Thomas: Let's say the when we looked at? Asked Va. Before there when you had looked at submitting a question, there was a a lot of categories. I don't know if you remember that or not?

375
00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:59.190
Thomas: Oh, no.

376
00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:00.700
> P15: Particularly. But yeah.

377
00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:09.750
Thomas: Okay, do you think? What you would see on this page? Let's say, if you had just a couple of questions, one might be sign in and technical issues.

378
00:28:09.810 --> 00:28:13.419
Thomas: The other one might just be for housing assistance and home loan.

379
00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:24.819
Thomas: Do you think? Would it make more sense than if the filter by category had every category that you could ask, or just the categories that you've asked questions about.

380
00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:29.170
> P15: Okay, yeah.

381
00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:32.460
> P15: as far as this, where I've already asked the question.

382
00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:36.219
> P15: This is, I like this setup. Very good.

383
00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:36.830
Thomas: Okay.

384
00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:38.500
> P15: You know, if I've already.

385
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:42.350
> P15: you know, asked it then. Yes, this would be

386
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:46.829
> P15: a lot better rather than having 20 categories whatever to look at.

387
00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:47.760
Thomas: Right? Okay.

388
00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:52.130
> P15: Never set this up. But yeah, that that's a very good setup.

389
00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:54.009
Thomas: Okay, well, that's good to hear.

390
00:28:55.105 --> 00:28:56.100
Thomas: So

391
00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:02.079
Thomas: filter by category, and seeing the housing assistance and home loans would be one way, you would find

392
00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:08.693
Thomas: the the question. So, aside from this filter

393
00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:15.150
Thomas: where do you think? In terms of where this question might be? How? How might you find that

394
00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:20.799
Thomas: that question. You. You'd looked at some of the stuff down below this filter area.

395
00:29:21.432 --> 00:29:24.149
Thomas: Is there anything else that you

396
00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:27.780
Thomas: would use in order to find that that question.

397
00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:31.490
Thomas: I don't know if I'm making sense on that.

398
00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:36.505
> P15: I think I understand what you mean. But

399
00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:46.470
Thomas: Is this page showing all the questions that we're on, that that you submitted right now.

400
00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:50.840
> P15: Well, I know there's a second page. So that's probably what I'd

401
00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:54.919
> P15: I'd probably end up going to the second page and see if it was there. Yes.

402
00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:56.340
Thomas: Okay, okay, all right.

403
00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:58.648
Thomas: So you did notice that?

404
00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:04.360
> P15: Yeah, I did notice over the second page. I just I don't know.

405
00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:05.000
Thomas: All right.

406
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:08.139
> P15: Had a had a dumb moment, or something.

407
00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:20.949
Thomas: No, that's it's okay. Just cause I I did notice that you scrolled all the way down that you scrolled back up. And it sometimes. Things just don't you know, pop in into our memory right away. But

408
00:30:21.257 --> 00:30:27.140
Thomas: I I noticed that you did kind of take some time down there to take a look at it. So I just had wondered if you might

409
00:30:27.708 --> 00:30:32.629
Thomas: have you. You've worked with with Websites that have had multiple pages.

410
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:39.859
> P15: Oh, yeah, I yeah, I do that all the time. Twice I spend a lot of time on Amazon shopping around and I

411
00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:43.439
> P15: and stuff. There's a lot of pages on that and stuff. So.

412
00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:49.410
Thomas: Okay, how do you find using like navigation like that with pagination?

413
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:52.640
Thomas: Do you have any problems with it at all? Or.

414
00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:54.340
> P15: Pagination.

415
00:30:54.758 --> 00:31:05.521
Thomas: Sorry like when you have like 1, 2, 3 like knowing that there's like multiple pages and navigating through all of those pages, do you?

416
00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:10.709
Thomas: Have any problems with navigating through those pages that way?

417
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:12.590
> P15: No, no, I don't have any trouble.

418
00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:13.670
Thomas: Okay. Sorry

419
00:31:15.275 --> 00:31:20.254
Thomas: the last thing that I wanna take a look at on this page is

420
00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:24.700
Thomas: Could you find a question that you that you submitted on August 24.th

421
00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:28.230
> P15: Microphone on

422
00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:31.170
> P15: Mouse. Quick

423
00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:40.679
> P15: miles. Left 50

424
00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:45.010
> P15: microphone off.

425
00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:50.819
> P15: Oh, it's right there on top. August 24.th

426
00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:56.379
> P15: If I didn't see that at first, st I probably would go to the last updated and see if

427
00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:59.450
> P15: I could get to the date that way, you know, if I.

428
00:31:59.450 --> 00:31:59.980
Thomas: Okay. Alright!

429
00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:01.620
> P15: Lots of questions in there.

430
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:06.600
Thomas: If you had lots of questions. Yeah, that makes sense. But you were able to spot it. It sounded like.

431
00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:06.870
> P15: Yeah.

432
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:07.240
Thomas: There!

433
00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:07.730
> P15: Yep.

434
00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:08.350
Thomas: Okay.

435
00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:10.949
> P15: As soon as I got rid of that category filter

436
00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:15.649
> P15: it popped right up. Yeah, I saw it right away.

437
00:32:15.650 --> 00:32:16.290
Thomas: All right.

438
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:25.570
Thomas: and so there, you see, you know, submitted on August 24.th

439
00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:32.580
Thomas: What it from what you can kind of read through on this card.

440
00:32:32.996 --> 00:32:35.630
Thomas: What is? What is this question about.

441
00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:48.270
> P15: Well, just

442
00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:50.228
> P15: how do you get your spouse?

443
00:32:51.342 --> 00:32:53.120
> P15: va id card.

444
00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:53.510
Thomas: Okay.

445
00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:54.500
> P15: I guess.

446
00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:55.370
Thomas: Okay, cool.

447
00:32:56.060 --> 00:33:16.910
Thomas: Now, one of the things that you'd mentioned with regards to being a little bit confused about of, like the status of reopened where you see replied in progress and and reopened here. Okay, so what we're gonna do on this next task is, we're going to go and we're gonna read the reply from the Va.

### Details page

Thomas: And so what I'd like for you to do is show me how you would navigate into this question to read what the Va. Replied to your question.

449
00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:32.190
> P15: I assume I would check for details.

450
00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:33.250
Thomas: Okay, so.

451
00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:34.130
> P15: Going on.

452
00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:37.480
> P15: Miles. 5,

453
00:33:40.770 --> 00:33:42.599
> P15: 7, 6, 2.

454
00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:46.410
> P15: Well, it's quick

455
00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:52.410
> P15: birds down

456
00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:01.590
> P15: microphone off.

457
00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:13.399
Thomas: Alright. So before we kind of get into the more the details of this page didn't seem like you had any difficulty finding the link to get into here. Correct.

458
00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:14.780
> P15: Right. No, I was

459
00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:18.251
> P15: bright blue. That was very obvious to me.

460
00:34:18.949 --> 00:34:21.367
Thomas: So in the 1st task here,

461
00:34:21.919 --> 00:34:28.659
Thomas: might be pretty easy for you. But is that I like for you to find the reply that the Va. Sent to you.

462
00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:40.569
> P15: Oh, well, it'd be September second. Be the middle one right there.

463
00:34:40.570 --> 00:34:41.330
Thomas: Okay,

464
00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:43.899
> P15: From? BA, so, yeah.

465
00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:49.699
Thomas: Okay? So all of those make sense in terms of what you kind of see in these these gray boxes.

466
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.360
> P15: Yes.

467
00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:52.060
Thomas: Okay.

468
00:34:53.576 --> 00:35:01.313
Thomas: so just talk to me a little bit about just so I can kind of get an understanding what each of these

469
00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:06.470
Thomas: kind of boxes are are about. Could you tell me a little bit about that?

470
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:08.880
> P15: Well, it's kind of

471
00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:16.379
> P15: the 1st 2 are kind of self explanatory. It it says your question with, you know what you put in there

472
00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:18.760
> P15: and what they roll back

473
00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:20.510
> P15: the next one down.

474
00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:24.290
> P15: Yeah, I guess it's just

475
00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:27.169
> P15: when you wrote back to the Va. Again.

476
00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:27.870
Thomas: Okay.

477
00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:37.350
Thomas: So what I like for you to do is I'm gonna ask you to open the reply from the Va. And just take a moment to read

478
00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:42.110
Thomas: that re their reply. Then I'd like to have you summarize their reply.

479
00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:43.570
> P15: Microphone on.

480
00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:46.320

488
00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:41.209
> P15: you know. And if you do have further questions, go to this website.

489
00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:41.830
Thomas: Okay.

490
00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:42.830
Thomas: alright.

491
00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:46.430
Thomas: And

492
00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:50.219
Thomas: would you have any? Follow up questions? After reading this message.

> P15: sitting here. I don't really have a question.

501
00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:33.900
Thomas: That makes sense.

502
00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:34.560
> P15: Yep.

503
00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:48.919
Thomas: Oh, so one of the things that I would also just want to kind of get your feedback on is, how do you feel about these accordions? You know how they open and close.

504
00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:59.240
> P15: I think it's all right. It just if you have a bunch.

505
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:03.799
> P15: Like. If I hit the parts up above, then it

506
00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:08.459
> P15: you could end up having quite a funeral line. It would kind of be nice with

507
00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:11.180
> P15: like, if I was to go to the one above.

508
00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:13.730
> P15: it would automatically close the one

509
00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:15.809
> P15: that I'm looking at right now.

510
00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:16.660
Thomas: Okay? No. Problem.

511
00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:17.440
> P15: What I mean.

512
00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:20.599
Thomas: Yeah, I know. I totally know exactly what you're saying.

513
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.479
Thomas: when you 1st came to this page.

514
00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:29.840
Thomas: were all of them close open

515
00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:31.429
Thomas: a mix.

516
00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:34.393
> P15: Well, the top 2 were

517
00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:37.939
> P15: closed. I knew that I hadn't needed to see

518
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:41.799
> P15: hit the plus sign to see more about it.

519
00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:43.992
> P15: but the bottom where it says

520
00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:47.110
> P15: your reply.

521
00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:49.590
> P15: but there is no reply, so

522
00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:52.459
> P15: I guess if I clicked on the dash it might be

523
00:38:52.570 --> 00:38:54.639
> P15: might be what I wrote, but.

524
00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:56.140
Thomas: Okay.

525
00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:58.919
> P15: When I 1st looked at it, kind of looks like oh.

526
00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:01.669
> P15: my reply, I don't have a reply.

527
00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:06.200
Thomas: Okay. So where it says your reply to the Va. You don't see a reply. There.

528
00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:09.859
> P15: Oh, okay, yeah, I do.

529
00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:10.690
Thomas: Okay.

530
00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:13.269
> P15: Does this mean? It kind of?

531
00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:17.429
> P15: I don't know. I'm just trying to.

532
00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:19.810
> P15: I kind of

533
00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:26.389
> P15: that didn't show up to me and at all to me. I don't know there was enough space in there, or what, but.

534
00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:27.180
Thomas: Right.

535
00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:30.310
> P15: Yeah makes makes sense. I just kinda I just kinda

536
00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:33.859
> P15: filtered it out. And I assumed I had something to do with something else. I don't know.

537
00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:34.290
Thomas: Oh!

538
00:39:34.290 --> 00:39:35.609
> P15: Why I said that.

539
00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:55.769
Thomas: Yeah, make? No, it makes total sense. One of the things that I'll tell you is that normally these boxes, these accordions have a a a border around the whole thing. So like you would have seen a border like around that text, maybe to help tying it to that. That gray box above.

540
00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:58.220
> P15: Yes, that would be better if there was a

541
00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:02.999
> P15: box that did around from the September 12th to the

542
00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:04.590
> P15: bottom of that.

543
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:06.219
> P15: you know. To me.

544
00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:06.480
Thomas: Yeah.

545
00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:10.359
> P15: To me. I think it'd be better like the one above that. You've got the yellow box.

546
00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:10.950
Thomas: Yep.

547
00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:13.640
> P15: Just around. If that was around the whole.

548
00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:14.000
Thomas: Yeah.

549
00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:16.310
> P15: The whole thing. I think that would be better.

550
00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:23.979
Thomas: Yeah. The the reason why the yellow, just to kind of give you some background on accessibility and focus

551
00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:28.700
Thomas: is that it puts the yellow boxes around things that you can click on.

552
00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:30.540
> P15: Oh, okay.

553
00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:40.680
Thomas: And but it's very good to hear that if if we had had the accordions designed properly, and if it had that that border around where the question was

554
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:45.430
Thomas: that would have helped you to see that question, because I it it totally makes sense

555
00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:47.340
Thomas: that you wouldn't have

556
00:40:47.776 --> 00:40:51.249
Thomas: connected the words below that that gray box. Okay.

557
00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:56.379
> P15: Sorry. I just yeah. I just didn't. My mind didn't. Didn't go there to start with. Yeah.

558
00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:56.880
Thomas: Nope.

559
00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:00.639
> P15: Yeah, if the board had been around that, that would have been, I think it would have

560
00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:03.400
> P15: Pop, you know, in my head a lot faster.

561
00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:04.570
Thomas: Okay. Alright.

562
00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:07.870
Thomas: so

563
00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:16.143
Thomas: is there anything else on this page that you found helpful, confusing,

564
00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:20.930
Thomas: surprising at at all, or anything like that that you want to give us feedback on.

565

575
00:42:19.330 --> 00:42:22.719
> P15: If you could just select what you wanted to print.

576
00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:23.370
Thomas: Hmm.

577
00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:28.030
> P15: Instead of putting the whole conversation. Let's say you just wanted the answer.

578
00:42:28.210 --> 00:42:33.509
> P15: and from you know what they sent. If you could print just that. I think that would be nice.

579
00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:34.830
Thomas: Hmm, okay.

580
00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:37.680
Thomas: there will be.

581
00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:40.649
> P15: There'll be times. I'll ask a doctor or something, and

582
00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:48.710
> P15: I want her answer. But I don't, you know, so I can give it to somebody else. They don't need to see. The whole conversation is

583
00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:52.120
> P15: need to see the information I received back.

584
00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:52.880
Thomas: Okay.

585
00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:54.619
Thomas: that makes sense.

586
00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:58.719
Thomas: about to see if we can do something like that because

587
00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:07.226
Thomas: it it can make a lot of sense. If you're only needing, maybe like one bit of information, maybe like what they replied to. Yeah.

588
00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:08.420
> P15: That's true.

589
00:43:09.872 --> 00:43:18.910
Thomas: And does it make sense that from this conversation you said that you asked an initial question, the Re. The Va. Responded.

590
00:43:19.090 --> 00:43:22.860
Thomas: Then you you did see your follow up question

591
00:43:23.595 --> 00:43:25.775
Thomas: does it make sense

592
00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:30.620
Thomas: of? Why, the status that you see up here is reopened?

593
00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:35.480
Thomas: Or is it still confusing.

594
00:43:37.102 --> 00:43:38.820
> P15: Well, I don't

595
00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:48.309
> P15: to me no, reopen doesn't make a lot of sense to me, because it's an ongoing conversation.

> P15: If it is something that

597
00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:53.633

600
00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:06.519

601
00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:18.929
Thomas: Okay, so what you saw down at the bottom. Let let's say like you, you asked an initial question. The the Va. Responded, and

602
00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:30.300
Thomas: you in that scenario that you were just talking about is that maybe a few days go by or a week goes by, and then you wanted to ask a follow up question. Is that what you were just saying.

603
00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:31.940
> P15: Yes.

604
00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:34.730
Thomas: Okay, would you be able to do that here.

00:44:57.300 --> 00:45:00.559

611
00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:01.210
Thomas: Okay.

612
00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:07.408
Thomas: So the the information down below where it says, send a reply. We could send a a follow up question.

613
00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:08.880
> P15: Yeah, I could just

614
00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:10.959

615
00:45:11.010 --> 00:45:13.029

617
00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:17.920

618
00:45:18.010 --> 00:45:24.319
> P15: Oh, you know, reopen or tell. There'd be a link somewhere that you could click on to reopen it.

619
00:45:24.350 --> 00:45:27.219
> P15: and then the reopen would make sense.

620
00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:27.680
Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: Okay.

625
00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:35.349
Thomas: that makes sense.

626
00:45:38.810 --> 00:45:45.149
Thomas: So from this conversation you saw here, you saw your question, the response from the Va

627
00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:47.500
Thomas: is there anything else.

628
00:45:47.650 --> 00:45:50.600

645
00:46:57.410 --> 00:46:59.834
Thomas: Back in the conversation.

646
00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:09.500
Thomas: there was a there. There was something that was sent on September 12.th Who sent that message that was sent on September 12.th

Thomas: Okay, yeah. So in in all of this, this is

655
00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:36.389
Thomas: your question. Response from the Va, and then on September 12, th

656
00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:40.589

666
00:47:59.060 --> 00:48:02.100
> P15: from the Va. But I still set the question. Anyway.

667
00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:03.050
Thomas: Yeah, right?

668
00:48:04.348 --> 00:48:10.009
Thomas: And where would where do you think that that question was sent from your reply to the Va.

669
00:48:16.110 --> 00:48:17.910
> P15: I would assume it would be.

670
00:48:18.930 --> 00:48:20.430
> P15: Send a reply.

671
00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:22.980
Thomas: Okay, alright. So does that make sense.

672
00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:24.360
> P15: Yes, at all

673
00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:26.449
> P15: makes total sense. I.

674
00:48:26.450 --> 00:48:26.870
Thomas: Okay.

675
00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:28.960
> P15: Work with my healthy vet, but

676
00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:33.189
> P15: quite often. And it's set up a lot like that

677
00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:38.820
> P15: or, well, something like that. But yeah, that makes total sense to me, anyway.

### Cool down

Thomas: Yeah, okay. Alright.

679
00:48:42.234 --> 00:48:44.855
Thomas: so let's see.

680
00:48:45.810 --> 00:48:47.260
Thomas: I'm gonna just

681
00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:53.180
Thomas: really, we've gone through a lot of the things here that that we needed to to talk about

682
00:48:53.556 --> 00:49:05.290
Thomas: [P15], is there anything that you want to give us additional feedback on? Or thoughts? About the 4 well, BA, basically about the dashboard here. And and the question details.

683
00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:13.340
> P15: Not that I can think of off the top of my head here.

684
00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:14.070
Thomas: Okay.

685
00:49:15.170 --> 00:49:19.310
Thomas: overall for the experience. How was it for you.

686
00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:22.849
> P15: I think most of it was

687
00:49:23.230 --> 00:49:29.919
> P15: pretty self explanatory. I I think it was. It took me a little bit to pick up on things. But

688
00:49:30.750 --> 00:49:36.609
> P15: the I think, the hardest thing for me, and was right in front of my face to pick up on, was

689
00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:39.399
> P15: the response that are sent back

690
00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:41.310
> P15: on September 12, th

691
00:49:41.590 --> 00:49:44.289
> P15: you know, if I had the box run, I think it'd be.

692
00:49:44.730 --> 00:49:50.519
> P15: but you know, once once you pick up on it once the next time I went back to the website

693
00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:52.530
> P15: I would know that, you know.

694
00:49:52.710 --> 00:49:56.040
> P15: I would know that the that's the way it shows up. But.

695
00:49:56.040 --> 00:50:02.350
Thomas: Okay, well, we're definitely gonna be working on on some of that design, that visual design to to helping folks

696
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:12.319
Thomas: make it more sense. Make more sense for folks who who can see it and so know that everything that you've helped us out with today from

697
00:50:12.997 --> 00:50:17.619
Thomas: filtering the questions to kind of pointing out

698
00:50:17.790 --> 00:50:23.249
Thomas: things that have been helpful, or things that have been not quite as clear.

699
00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:32.070
Thomas: All of those things we have written down and are gonna be very helpful, as we kind of like huddle back after after these sessions.

700
00:50:32.070 --> 00:50:39.040
> P15: Well, I'm glad I could help a little, but and to me the biggest improvement I think they could be

701
00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:41.710
> P15: done to it is to be able to report.

702
00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:42.990
> P15: print

703
00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:49.050
> P15: the separate, you know, print things separately, rather than having to print the whole conversation.

704
00:50:49.050 --> 00:50:49.770
Thomas: Okay.

705
00:50:49.900 --> 00:51:04.349
Thomas: definitely, look to see if if there's something we can do about that. And but like, I said, that's 1 of those things that I have noted down. It's it's something that nobody else had had mentioned yet. But it makes makes complete sense.

706
00:51:05.850 --> 00:51:07.949
Thomas: So anyway,

707
00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:10.709
> P15: So that's it, huh?

708
00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:13.470
Thomas: Okay, yeah. No other questions for me at all.

709
00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:15.789
> P15: Not that I can think of.

710
00:51:15.790 --> 00:51:19.502
Thomas: Okay. Well, [P15], thank you so much for your time today.

711

714

Thomas: Alright, bye, bye.
