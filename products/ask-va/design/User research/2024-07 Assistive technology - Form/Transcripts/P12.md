Tyler: Okay. Awesome.

4
00:00:10.813 --> 00:00:16.650
Tyler: Well, that was a lot of information. And you met a lot of people. Do you have any questions for me? At this point.

5
00:00:17.157 --> 00:00:19.189
> P12: No, no, everything's clear.

6
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:20.700
Tyler: Awesome.

7
00:00:21.278 --> 00:00:29.030
Tyler: Well, you said, you've done research with the Va. About a year ago, so this should probably feel pretty familiar. But let me know if you have any questions as we as we.

8
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:29.830
> P12: Okay.

9
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:40.818
Tyler: before we get started. Going through the the website that we're going to test together. I'd just love to learn a little bit more about you. Your experience with the Va.

10
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.399
Tyler: How long have you been a veteran?

11
00:00:44.491 --> 00:00:47.259
> P12: Let's see, for about 10 years.

12
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.570
Tyler: Okay.

13
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.960
Tyler: and did you start interacting with the Va right when you got out of service, or just.

14
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.249
> P12: No, no. After I got out.

15
00:00:58.644 --> 00:00:59.500
Tyler: Okay.

16
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.950
> P12: Whole other life before the Va.

17
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.069
Tyler: have you? How do you usually get in touch with the Va. These days?

18
00:01:11.857 --> 00:01:17.029
> P12: Let's see, I called the one the number.

19
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.570
Tyler: The 1, 800 number.

20
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.569
> P12: Through. Yeah, or I contact them through secure messaging.

21
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.410
Tyler: Okay through secure messaging as well. Nice.

22
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.240
Tyler: Do you have a preference? Why might you prefer secure messaging or or calling.

23
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.479
> P12: I know with secure messaging, they're required to respond back to you in a certain amount of time.

24
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.959
> P12: so that's the best way

25
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.490
Tyler: Make sense

26
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:55.539
Tyler: secure. Messaging is a good way to speak to like your your nurses and your primary care. Team right? What if you have a question about something that's unrelated to healthcare.

27
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.780
> P12: If it's unrelated to health care, I'll just go to the website and look for that. That agency.

28
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.550
Tyler: Okay.

29
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.439
> P12: Not that far in the Va, yeah.

30
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.869
Tyler: Yeah. And what are you looking for? Are you looking for a phone number to contact them? Or are you looking for.

31
00:02:12.204 --> 00:02:12.539
> P12: Like.

32
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.920
Tyler: Information you can.

33
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.720
> P12: Phone Numbers.

34
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.410
Tyler: okay.

35
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.929
Tyler: awesome. Have you ever heard of something called? Ask Va.

36
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.710
> P12: No! No!

37
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.130
Tyler: Okay.

38
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:42.770
Tyler: So we're going to talk a little bit more about ask Va today. But for now I'd love to just learn a little bit more about your experience with a voiceover. How long have you been using a screen, reader, or or voice over.

39
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.980
> P12: For about

40
00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.470
> P12: I guess. About 14 years.

41
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.979
Tyler: Okay, yeah, that's quite a long time. And how often do you use it?

42
00:02:54.892 --> 00:02:59.219
> P12: I'll I'll use it as well. I get frustrated with the website.

43
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.870
Tyler: You get frustrated. You said.

44
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.528
> P12: Yeah, yeah, I, switch over

45
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.269
Tyler: Okay. Yep.

46
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.900
> P12: A lot of times with the Va. Website.

47
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.821
> P12: I pretty much knelt down. I could just go in if I could use voice over. I use it

48
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.910
> P12: but sometimes it gets kind of complicated.

49
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.019
Tyler: Okay.

50
00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:27.520
Tyler: let's let's talk a little bit more about that. What is it? What might like lead you to being frustrated and wanting to use voice over. Can you give me an example.

51
00:03:29.704 --> 00:03:33.439
> P12: yes, just switching from page to page.

52
00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:44.670
Tyler: yeah, and is that because the website is like hard to read or it's taking a long time, what might.

53
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.959
> P12: It takes takes a long time.

54
00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.940
Tyler: Yeah.

55
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.240
Tyler: that makes sense.

56
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.516
Tyler: and what? So you said, you're on an ipad today, right is that, usually, how you would

57
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.710
Tyler: do you often use your ipad to go online.

58
00:04:03.156 --> 00:04:04.049
> P12: Yes, yes.

59
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.299
Tyler: have you used?

60
00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.089
Tyler: Have you used voiceover, or an or a different screen? Reader on

61
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.690
Tyler: on your computer, or, your phone.

62
00:04:14.142 --> 00:04:16.069
> P12: No, no, I

63
00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:17.990
> P12: I I tried to.

64
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.719
> P12: I avoid using voice over on the computer.

65
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.770
> P12: I guess more, even more complicated. It's easier to navigate on the ipad, I think.

66
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:28.840
> P12: okay.

67
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.190
Tyler: Cool. That makes sense. Well, I'm glad you joined from your ipad.

68
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:40.889
Tyler: I want to just check. If Evan has any other questions about tech setup before we keep going.

69
00:04:42.585 --> 00:04:53.329
Evan: I don't think I have any. Are you familiar with? Using zoom on your ipad with voice over, or do you use voice over to open, zoom, and or utilize it.

70
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.069
> P12: Yes, yes, I do. I have.

71
00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.810
Evan: Oh, see? Okay. So you have used zoom on your ipad. Using voice over.

72
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:02.520
> P12: Yes.

73
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.905
Evan: Awesome, awesome. Okay? Well, like, I said, if you need any help with anything

74
00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.870
> P12: Yeah, the thing is like on a lot of websites. Things change

75
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.609
> P12: one day the menu may be at bottom the next. It may be at top.

76
00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:20.460
Evan: Hmm.

77
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.740
> P12: Just

78
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.810
> P12: So sometimes it gets confusing, using voiceover, because.

79
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.819
> P12: you can go on. And everything's totally different from the last time you're on.

80
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:41.460
Evan: Yeah, yeah, I understand. Well, as mentioned, I will be here to help you every step of the way. I'll pass it back to Tyler and I'll jump back in if I'm needed.

81
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.400
> P12: Okay. Thanks.

82
00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.130
Evan: Problem.

83
00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:45.670
Tyler: Thanks, Evan.

84
00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:52.769
Tyler: [P12], I think what we should do next is, get you set up sharing your screen.

85
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:53.460
> P12: Okay.

86
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.749
Tyler: Have you shared your screen on zoom before.

87
00:05:56.476 --> 00:05:57.930
> P12: Yes, yes.

88
00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:04.900
Tyler: Okay, so we'll share your screen now. And let me know if you need any help, and I'll let you know when I see your screen.

89
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:06.660
> P12: Okay.

90
00:06:13.683 --> 00:06:15.430
> P12: let's see.

91
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.539
> P12: Wonder I

92
00:06:37.894 --> 00:06:40.439
> P12: what what do should I share.

93
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.570
Tyler: So

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.200
Tyler: are you on the have you gotten to where it says, share.

96
00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:54.009
Tyler: Screen. Okay, cool. So we're just going to share your whole screen. So you might have to go through a list of options. And eventually it'll you'll hear screen.

97
00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:58.490
> P12: Okay, this is this is Jane. Still whiteboard.

98

105
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:19.689
> P12: Oh, okay, there we go. It's all the way to the top.

106
00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:21.420
Tyler: Got it.

107
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:42.720
Tyler: [P12].

108
00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:43.850
> P12: Yes.

109
00:07:43.850 --> 00:08:06.829
Tyler: I just wanna check do you have voice over on right now, and I won't be able to hear. Okay, cool. So since I'm not able to hear it. I just want to let you know that it's okay that I can't hear it. It just means like, I'll probably be quiet as much as possible in case your screen reader is is announcing something, and when it's not, if I'm like being quiet you can be like you can talk now. We're good.

110
00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:07.650
> P12: Okay.

111
00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:08.829
Tyler: Just so, you know, okay.

112
00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:16.909
Tyler: so have you found you found share screen? And what's your screen, reader announcing next.

113
00:08:18.554 --> 00:08:20.650
> P12: It's got share screen.

114
00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:23.980
Tyler: Perfect.

115
00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:31.750
Tyler: Okay, awesome. I can. I can see your screen now.

116
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:32.610
> P12: Good, good.

117
00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:34.069
Tyler: Yeah, so

118
00:08:37.219 --> 00:08:42.692
Tyler: okay, cool. So it says, screen broadcast. And then,

119
00:08:44.229 --> 00:08:58.935
Tyler: there's this everything on your screen. Okay? So I've seen this screen before, and I ha! We had a little bit of difficulty getting past this screen. But let's let's see how we do. It looks like you've done everything correctly. It's just

120
00:08:59.549 --> 00:09:16.889
Tyler: Yeah. Let's just see how we how we go. So the next thing that we want to do is open up a website? So there's different ways. We could do this. I could send you a link to the website, and you would navigate to the chat on zoom, and you would open the link.

121
00:09:17.506 --> 00:09:30.699
Tyler: So that's 1 option. Another option is you navigate to whichever browser you usually use. So if that's like safari. We would go to safari, and then I can dictate the link to you. So you can type it in. Do you have a preference.

122
00:09:31.181 --> 00:09:32.930
> P12: Could you send it to me.

123
00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:35.000
Tyler: Yeah, I'll send it in the chat.

124
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.600
Tyler: So this is going to come through the chat on zoom.

125
00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:44.370
> P12: Okay.

126
00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.359
> P12: okay, I'm

127
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:08.059
> P12: every problem getting past the my page.

128
00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.439
Tyler: Yeah, what are you hearing? Now?

129
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:15.229
> P12: Okay. I took it off of Voiceover and it disappeared.

130
00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:18.679
> P12: Got it? Okay.

131
00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.879
> P12: okay, yeah.

132
00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.709
> P12: So are you sending a message?

133
00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:27.630
> P12: Oh, Jet.

134
00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:30.430
Tyler: Yeah, I sent you a chat. I'll send it again.

135
00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:34.799
Tyler: and it should come up on your screen.

136
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:37.039
Tyler: It should be announced as well.

137
00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.849
> P12: Okay, yeah, there we go.

138
00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:43.570
> P12: Okay.

139
00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:49.580
Tyler: So let me know when that's open.

140
00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:50.660
> P12: It's open.

141
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:59.510
Tyler: Okay, cool. So that's great that that's open. What's happened? Since then, is it stopped sharing your screen. So we just need to get.

142
00:10:59.510 --> 00:10:59.880
> P12: Oh!

143
00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:26.989
Tyler: Sharing again. And that's not your fault. This is not a simple thing to do. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna navigate. I'm gonna tell you now and then I'll give you a moment to try and do it. We're gonna navigate back to Zoom. So you're gonna get back to the zoom application. And then when you get to the zoom application, you're gonna share, you're gonna click, share and then share screen, just like you did before. And then once we get to that point, we'll pause there. Okay.

144
00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:27.930
> P12: Okay.

145
00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:29.829
> P12: I'm in fear.

146
00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:54.539
> P12: Okay, can you see it now?

147
00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:57.310
Tyler: Not yet. What are you hearing on your side?

148
00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.160
> P12: Screen broadcast.

149
00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:05.819
> P12: I've got the red dot here.

150
00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:08.430
Tyler: Interesting. Okay.

151
00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:09.890
Tyler: Hmm.

152
00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:10.714
> P12: And

153
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:15.530
> P12: it's got stop broadcast. Those at the bottom.

154
00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:20.620
Tyler: Okay, why don't we try and choose? Stop broadcast and try again.

155
00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:21.520
> P12: I'm sorry.

156
00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:26.880
Tyler: Let's choose. Stop broadcast, and then we'll try again, because I'm not seeing it.

157
00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.090
> P12: Reason that's not working on.

158
00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:04.689
Tyler: It's not working. What? What screen are you on now? Can you describe it to me?

159
00:13:05.257 --> 00:13:06.960
> P12: The start broadcast.

160
00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.849
Tyler: The start broadcast. Okay.

161
00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.219
Tyler: and it's just

162
00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:16.032
Tyler: it hasn't started broadcast. It's just

163
00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:20.080
Tyler: or or where is it? Exactly?

164
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:21.060
Tyler: Bye.

165
00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:23.220
> P12: Okay. It just popped up.

166
00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:24.980
> P12: Now it's starting.

167
00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:25.910
Tyler: Okay.

168
00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:27.810
Tyler: I'll let you know if I see it.

169
00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:30.210
> P12: On it.

170
00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:49.670
Tyler: So I'm not seeing your screen yet.

171
00:13:58.230 --> 00:13:59.350
> P12: Okay.

172
00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:01.710
> P12: let me hit stop again.

173
00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:04.010
Tyler: Hmm.

174
00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:06.620
> P12: And I.

175
00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.189
Tyler: So another thing we can do

176
00:14:10.845 --> 00:14:14.200
Tyler: if we're really struggling to get the screen share working

177
00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:16.070
> P12: Okay.

178
00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:19.960
Tyler: We can go through the session without you sharing your screen.

179
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:26.960
Tyler: It's gonna be a little bit different, because I'm not going to be able to see your screen. And I also can't hear your screen, reader.

180
00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:34.650
Tyler: but you're still gonna be able to go through the website using voice over and explain to me how it's going for you.

181
00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:38.850
Tyler: Do you want to try that? Or do you want to try and get screen share working.

182
00:14:40.484 --> 00:14:42.730
> P12: It's it's up to you. If.

183
00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:58.290
Tyler: Why don't we try it? Why don't we try it this way? I know it might feel a little bit funny for both of us. But I think the screen share is gonna get increasingly frustrating to try and set up because we've had issues with this before on

184
00:14:58.560 --> 00:14:59.130
> P12: Okay.

185
00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:07.008
Tyler: On ipads. So let's try that, and let's just give it a go. And if it's a bit funny, or it doesn't work out, that's totally fine.

186
00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:08.460
Tyler: So

187
00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:29.639
Tyler: the thing that I'm gonna need from you during the session is any sort of feedback you can give me verbally, since I can't hear your screen, reader. So we're gonna open up the website. Your screen, reader, is gonna be telling you what's on the website. And then it's gonna pause. And at that point, if you can say to me, okay, I've opened up the website. This is the title of the page that'll be really helpful. Okay.

188
00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:30.510
> P12: Okay.

189
00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:34.690
Tyler: All right, let's try that. So go ahead and navigate to the website that we opened up.

190
00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:36.739
> P12: Yeah, I've got. I've got it.

191
00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:37.800
Tyler: Perfect.

### Form

> P12: And I've I'm down at. Ask Va.

193
00:15:42.960 --> 00:16:05.019
Tyler: Okay, perfect. So let's stay on that page for a minute. So I'll tell you a little bit about what we're doing today and give you some more context. So this is a tool called, Ask Va, it's a way for veterans to contact the Va online. If they have a question in in today's session. We're gonna pretend, like, you need to ask the Va a question about your healthcare. Okay?

194
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:09.619
Tyler: So you're gonna say, I've come onto this website because I have a question about my healthcare.

195
00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:13.030
Tyler: And I'll remind you of that scenario whenever you need me to.

196
00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:14.050
> P12: Okay.

197
00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:25.059
Tyler: And as you navigate I'm gonna stay pretty quiet, and I'm gonna let you go through the the form, and you're gonna be, you know, answering questions and and doing things like that.

198
00:16:25.349 --> 00:16:44.719
Tyler: And whenever your screen reader pauses, if you can tell me, give me some feedback like I'm on this page. I just filled in this or if you can say, you know, this is really confusing. I don't understand what they're asking me. Anything like that will be really helpful. So we'll just take some pauses. Otherwise you're gonna lead me through the the tool. Okay.

199
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:45.515
> P12: Okay.

200
00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:49.020
Tyler: Awesome, so you can go ahead and get started whenever you're ready.

201
00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:50.020
> P12: Okay?

202
00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:52.040
> P12: Oh.

203
00:16:58.170 --> 00:16:59.190
> P12: as

204
00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:08.759
> P12: is, do I press? Ask a new question.

205
00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:14.739
Tyler: Yeah, that that sounds right. Does that feel like it's the right place to go for you?

206
00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:20.270
> P12: Yes, it. It's asking for my personal information.

207
00:17:26.339 --> 00:17:29.040
> P12: Okay, it's got the personal information.

208
00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:31.940
> P12: so is that

209
00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:33.609
> P12: okay? I'm sorry.

210
00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:44.139
Tyler: That's okay. Let's just pause for a second there. So you said it was showing your personal information. So why do you think the personal information was being read to you.

211
00:17:48.169 --> 00:17:51.559
> P12: Well, to make sure that you're the right person.

212
00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:56.190
Tyler: Okay, cool. And what information did you? Hear? Aloud.

213
00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:00.560
> P12: social security number

214
00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:01.970
> P12: day of birth.

215
00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:05.499
Tyler: Cool. Okay, go ahead and continue.

216
00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:15.560
> P12: Okay.

217
00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:22.890
> P12: Now, there's a box that says 0, complete with form.

218
00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:31.329
> P12: Okay. Now it's

219
00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.190
> P12: let's go down.

220
00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:38.610
> P12: Do where it says, select category.

221
00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:44.670
> P12: Okay.

222
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:51.499
> P12: Okay. Now, I got the dropdown

223
00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:54.250
> P12: menu and it's asking me to select.

224
00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:00.875
> P12: Asked me to select a reason for my

225
00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:03.050
> P12: contact.

226
00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:09.859
> P12: And we've got education, disability, compensation.

227
00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:11.140
> P12: healthcare.

228
00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:13.560
> P12: Which one should I select?

229
00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:17.169
Tyler: We're going to say that your question is about healthcare today.

230
00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.860
> P12: Healthcare. Okay.

231
00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:21.660
> P12: okay.

232
00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:29.440
> P12: even

233
00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:32.219
> P12: okay. Continue.

234
00:19:45.675 --> 00:19:49.919
> P12: Now, it's I'm down where it has the topics.

235
00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:50.640
Tyler: Okay.

236
00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:51.590
> P12: The topic.

237
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:53.060
> P12: and

238
00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:58.565
> P12: good.

239
00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:01.590
> P12: audio and

240
00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:04.800
> P12: the different type options you can select.

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:09.260

> P12: which one should I select.

245
00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:32.680
Tyler: You can actually choose any of those options today. Do you have any questions as you go through the options? Or are they feeling straightforward to you?

246
00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:37.440
> P12: Okay.

247
00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:50.000
> P12: a lot of different categories.

248
00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:56.400
> P12: Okay, the

249
00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:59.330

250
00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:01.360
> P12: myself?

251
00:21:11.303 --> 00:21:12.409
> P12: Press. Continue.

252
00:21:22.046 --> 00:21:23.804

> P12: I'm the veteran.

254
00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:26.900
Tyler: Okay.

255
00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:28.210
> P12: Continue.

256
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:34.859
> P12: No, it's asking for the facility.

257
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:38.870
> P12: Okay.

258
00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:47.200
> P12: Okay.

259
00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:59.350
Tyler: So, [P12].

260
00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:01.419
Tyler: when you have a pause, let me know.

261
00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:02.500
> P12: Okay.

262
00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:07.470
> P12: let's see, it's asking me to select the area.

263
00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:08.750
Tyler: Okay.

264
00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.100
> P12: Have you?

265
00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:14.205
> P12: There's a blue in blue writing. It says,

266
00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:18.200
> P12: use my location.

267
00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:19.730
Tyler: Gotcha.

268
00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:21.537
> P12: I clicked on that. And

269
00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:25.030
> P12: let's see what the

270
00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:33.510
> P12: I was thinking that would automatically select the location.

271
00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:36.019
Tyler: And did that not work.

272
00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.580
> P12: No, it didn't work.

273
00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:38.070
Tyler: Okay.

274
00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:40.119
> P12: It's asking me to put the city in.

275
00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:01.969
> P12: Okay, it's asking me. I put the Zip code in.

276
00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:04.315
Tyler: Okay.

277
00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:05.990
> P12: It's searching.

278
00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:11.170
> P12: And I came up with 60 results.

279
00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:14.410
> P12: Okay?

280
00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:16.743
> P12: And it

281
00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:23.459
> P12: it came up with all the different locations in my area.

282
00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:24.940
Tyler: Okay.

283
00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:27.650
> P12: So I'll select one.

284
00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:31.270
Tyler: And

285
00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:36.199
Tyler: if you can pause for a minute when your screen reader is not announcing.

286
00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:39.230
> P12: I'm sorry.

287
00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:43.850
Tyler: That's okay. I just wanted to pause real quick. When you have a moment.

288
00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:44.610
> P12: Okay.

289
00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:54.667
Tyler: Perfect. 1st of all, you're doing incredibly. It's really really helpful the way you're navigating and explaining it to me so I wouldn't change a thing.

290
00:23:55.710 --> 00:24:07.400
Tyler: so what happened there was? It sounded like@firstst You would have preferred for it to use your location and and to just automatically choose a facility based on that right. And it didn't.

291
00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.960
> P12: Right, right, right.

292
00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:15.939
Tyler: Yeah. Why, why do you think that was your preference? Is that what you noticed first, st or is that what you usually would do.

293
00:24:16.935 --> 00:24:19.010
> P12: No, no. I just noticed that.

294
00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:26.700
> P12: I thought, it's pretty neat that it would allow me to use that, because if you're in another area, and you need to find a Va

295
00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:32.359
> P12: I would think that would have the closest location.

296
00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:33.590
Tyler: Yeah.

297
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:36.660
> P12: It will come up with the the ones that are around you.

298
00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:47.569
Tyler: That makes sense. And then you mentioned to me it was in blue text, Are you? Sometimes relying on visuals on the screen, and sometimes just relying on your screen. Reader.

299
00:24:48.285 --> 00:24:51.259
> P12: Well, the the visuals stand out.

300
00:24:52.192 --> 00:24:56.879
> P12: For something like that would have been a different color, that it jumps out at you.

301
00:24:57.090 --> 00:25:03.989
Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense, and then, when you tried to choose, use my location, did it give you an error message?

302
00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:05.850
> P12: Yes, you did!

303
00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.530
Tyler: Do you remember what it said?

304
00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:09.469
> P12: Yes, hold on a sec.

305
00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:14.240
> P12: It says, please fill in the city or postal code.

306
00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:18.160
Tyler: So it just was like, Nope, actually, we just want you to type this in.

307
00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:19.240
> P12: Yes.

308
00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:30.799
Tyler: Got it okay? And then when you typed in, it sounded like you typed in your postal code. And then you told me how many results you found, and then you went and chat and chose your your health, facility.

309
00:25:31.493 --> 00:25:35.010
> P12: Yes, yes. Once it asked me to put the zip in.

310
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:38.075
> P12: My

311
00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:41.230
> P12: my area code.

312
00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:42.969
> P12: It popped up on the

313
00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:45.840
> P12: the search bar.

314
00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:48.023
> P12: so all I had to do is tap on the

315
00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:49.960
> P12: The other Phil.

316
00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:52.480
Tyler: Got it. Okay.

317
00:25:53.190 --> 00:26:08.309
Tyler: cool? Well, that that seems like you managed to get through it, even though there was like something happened, and it didn't work, which is annoying. You were like, Okay, I know how to, you know. Do this other way, and it still worked out. So let's let's keep going, just as you've been doing before.

318
00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:09.220
> P12: Okay.

319
00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:21.600
> P12: okay, says, you're 21

320
00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:23.370
> P12: percent complete

321
00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:27.880
> P12: contact information.

322
00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.850
> P12: Okay, do I need to type in the telephone number?

323
00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:39.900
Tyler: Well, that's a reason.

324
00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:41.060
> P12: I'm sorry.

325
00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:46.319
Tyler: That's a really good question. Does it seem like it's pre-filled, or is that not clear.

326
00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.120
> P12: Well, they're they're numbers

327
00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:49.330
> P12: there.

328
00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:56.340
Tyler: yeah, did your screen reader announce that to you? Or did you notice that from looking at the screen.

329
00:26:56.711 --> 00:26:59.309
> P12: And announce it. Okay, and announce it.

330
00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:10.340
Tyler: Okay? Well, I can explain why it's filled in, because it's a little funny. So we're pretending like you signed into your account. So we're gonna pretend like, that's your phone number and your email address.

331
00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:11.050
> P12: Okay.

332
00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:16.820
Tyler: So if it read out loud your phone number, do you think you would have been confused, or that would have made sense.

333
00:27:17.591 --> 00:27:19.700
> P12: It would have made sense. Yeah.

334
00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:20.709
Tyler: That makes sense.

335
00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:26.659
> P12: Okay. So after email.

336
00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:32.900
> P12: how should it's asking how I should be contacted.

337
00:27:35.898 --> 00:27:38.449
> P12: I'll press phone call.

338
00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:49.640
> P12: Okay, it's just listing all the options.

339
00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:51.680
Tyler: Okay.

340
00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:57.499
> P12: Okay, now it's asking for the name you want to be referred to as

341
00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:00.080
> P12: pronouns.

342
00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:03.400
> P12: hey?

343
00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:12.329
> P12: And all your different pronouns.

344
00:28:14.676 --> 00:28:16.130
> P12: No, continue.

345
00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:19.510
Tyler: Did you choose?

346
00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:21.680
> P12: Okay.

347
00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:26.130
> P12: okay, if your pronouns aren't listed

348
00:28:28.006 --> 00:28:30.919
> P12: interim here, it gives you the place

349
00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:32.739
> P12: and you

350
00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:37.599
> P12: 24% complete. It's telity.

351
00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:42.560
> P12: I was asking for the poster code again.

352
00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:56.960
> P12: Good thing

353
00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:59.460
> P12: I was asking for postcode.

354
00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:17.599
> P12: Now it's asked for the postal code. Twice I had to do the location. Now it's asking for it again.

355
00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:18.770
Tyler: Okay.

356
00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:21.760
Tyler: So when you say that it's asking for it again.

357
00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:22.680
> P12: I mean.

358
00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:26.720
Tyler: You had to provide it on an earlier page that we already talked about.

359
00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.230
> P12: Yes. Yes. Okay.

360
00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:28.820
Tyler: Yeah.

361
00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:34.320
> P12: When I was locating the Va. The closest one, and asked for the echo that

362
00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:35.869
> P12: now it's asking for

363
00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:37.910
> P12: again.

364
00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:41.170
Tyler: That makes sense. Yeah, that's redundant. Huh?

365
00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:42.710
> P12: Okay, yes.

366
00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:49.200
> P12: Okay, 90% complete.

367
00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:53.180
> P12: Now, it's asking for my question, what is my question?

368
00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:57.840
> P12: Yeah.

369
00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:58.869
Tyler: Awesome. So you.

370
00:29:58.870 --> 00:29:59.360
> P12: So do it.

371
00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:05.150
Tyler: Anything in there. It's even if you just put like test, or you can think of a question that you might ask the Va.

372
00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:05.980
> P12: Okay.

373
00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:16.650
> P12: I'm not fast a typer. So

374
00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:20.280
> P12: okay.

375
00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:33.880
> P12: okay, 98%. Complete

376
00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:39.780
> P12: editing answers.

377
00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:45.209
> P12: okay, so this is the page where I can

378
00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:47.330
> P12: edit. My

379
00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:51.190
> P12: would have entered before

380
00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:52.180
> P12: this.

381
00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:02.019
> P12: and it just reviews the selections I made previously.

382
00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:05.240
> P12: and I guess you can go in and change here.

383
00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:09.130
> P12: Yeah, yeah, it has an edit.

384
00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:11.790
> P12: Okay? Yep.

385
00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:24.860
Tyler: So

386
00:31:25.770 --> 00:31:28.700
Tyler: I just want to make sure that your screen reader is not announcing.

387
00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:30.670
> P12: Okay.

388
00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:32.870
> P12: I'm sorry.

389
00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:51.339
Tyler: That's okay. I just wanted to make sure. There was a a pause before I started talking. So you got to this page and you. It felt really clear to you that this page is about editing other selections that you've already made before you finish the form. You notice that it was at 98% complete.

390
00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:58.359
Tyler: awesome. So do you have any questions at this point about anything that we've done.

391
00:31:58.730 --> 00:32:00.950
> P12: No, no! It seems pretty simple.

392
00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:11.199
Tyler: Okay, well, you go. You can go ahead. And on this page, you can go ahead, and you know, read through anything you want to, and then, when you're ready, you can submit your question.

393
00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:11.940
> P12: Okay.

394
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:17.350
> P12: gives you the ability.

395
00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:23.069
> P12: Okay, I'm submitting the question.

396
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.220
> P12: It says that it was submitted successfully.

397
00:32:30.935 --> 00:32:31.710
> P12: Okay.

398
00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:35.000
Tyler: Awesome.

399
00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.070
> P12: And it gives a confirmation number.

400
00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:42.910
Tyler: Perfect. Okay? Well.

401
00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:53.199
Tyler: reading this page where it tells you you've submitted the question, and it gives you a confirmation number. Do you have any questions at this point about what would happen next.

402
00:32:53.992 --> 00:32:56.190
> P12: No no, no.

403
00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:56.870
Tyler: Okay.

### Cool down

Tyler: okay, awesome. Well, you made it to the end of the the website or the test that we're gonna run through.

405
00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:07.100
> P12: Okay.

406
00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:16.909
Tyler: So that was really, really helpful. And I just want to reiterate you did a a great job of describing to me what you were doing so it was very, very easy for me to follow along.

407
00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:25.199
Tyler: so I just want to ask some kind of like reflection questions before we wrap up the session. Now that we went through that.

408
00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:25.560
> P12: Okay.

409
00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:36.320
Tyler: We talked about some things that were a bit like well, why am I having to do that like you felt like you had to enter your postcode twice. Which is a bit surprising.

410
00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:37.169
> P12: Done it. Yeah.

411
00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:47.379
Tyler: Yeah, totally. Is there anything else that you felt like through the form you were like? Why, why am I having to do this or any sort of confusion, otherwise.

412
00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:49.966
> P12: No, it it seemed it seemed

413
00:33:51.311 --> 00:33:53.819
> P12: real really easy to navigate.

414
00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:55.090
Tyler: That's good.

415
00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:58.605
> P12: I didn't have any any issues with it.

416
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:06.856
Tyler: That's good. Yeah. You went through it very quickly. And and that's really good to to see.

417
00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:15.800
Tyler: Another thing that you were mentioning to me as we were going through the form was sometimes it would say, like 90% complete.

418
00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:25.740
Tyler: can you talk to me about how how you found that? Was that helpful? Was that unnecessary.

419
00:34:27.739 --> 00:34:28.404
> P12: Well,

420
00:34:31.309 --> 00:34:35.289
> P12: it! I guess it depends on the person for someone that.

421
00:34:37.542 --> 00:34:41.467
> P12: Is concerned about the time that would be good. But

422
00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:48.149
> P12: no, it didn't bother me. It gave me a a guide as to how much longer I had to complete the

423
00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:50.530
> P12: how much further it needs to go.

424
00:34:52.389 --> 00:35:04.779
Tyler: yeah. And when you got to every page, or on a lot of the pages, you would say out loud to me, okay, 90% complete or, okay, 98% complete.

425
00:35:04.789 --> 00:35:05.329
Tyler: Right?

426
00:35:06.159 --> 00:35:11.639
Tyler: and that would have been the 1st thing that your screen reader was telling you when you arrived at a new page right.

427
00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:12.540
> P12: Yes, yes.

428
00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:21.599
Tyler: Okay, how do you find that? Is it helpful that that's the 1st thing that the screen reader says, or would you prefer it? Says something else when it arrives at a new page.

429
00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:24.060
> P12: No, that's that's just fine.

430
00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:24.760
Tyler: Okay.

431
00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:26.080
Tyler: yeah.

432
00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:31.350
Tyler: that makes sense. And then from there you are on the 90% complete.

433
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:36.599
Tyler: did you? How did you navigate to the next thing on the page that you wanted it to read.

434
00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:41.679
> P12: I just swipe down till I get to the continue.

435
00:35:42.455 --> 00:35:47.139
Tyler: Okay, cool. So you just swipe down. And then did you hear like a question after that.

436
00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:59.590
> P12: no, I didn't hear hear question. I don't. I don't recall hearing question.

437
00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:00.610
Tyler: Okay.

438
00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:03.439
Tyler: yeah. So I'm thinking about like.

439
00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:04.679
> P12: I'm sorry.

440
00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:13.470
Tyler: That's okay. I'm thinking about like the page where it said, who are you asking a question about? And you chose myself

441
00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:20.980
Tyler: so it would have said, maybe 12% complete with form. Who are you asking a question about?

442
00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:24.049
Tyler: And then you would choose who you were asking a question about.

443
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:32.500
Tyler: So that's why I meant by the question. So it would have went from the percent complete. And then, after that, you hear a question.

444
00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:32.980
> P12: Exactly.

445
00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:33.310
Tyler: You're.

446
00:36:33.310 --> 00:36:34.400
> P12: Yes, yes.

447
00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:35.070
Tyler: Okay.

448
00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:36.190
Tyler: cool.

449
00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:40.030
Tyler: awesome.

450
00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:42.920
Tyler: Was there anything that you found?

451
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.329
Tyler: particularly challenging? Using voice over specifically.

452
00:36:49.654 --> 00:36:53.549
> P12: No, no, I think you guys done a great job with this.

453
00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:55.030
Tyler: Okay.

454
00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:56.749
> P12: Compared to other sites.

455
00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:57.880
Tyler: Yeah.

456
00:36:59.210 --> 00:37:01.079
> P12: It's real easy to maneuver.

457
00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:14.949
Tyler: That's good. I have another question about the the percent complete that we were just talking about. So as you're going through the form. It's obviously adding, right? It was going like 2124.

458
00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:18.089
Tyler: At 1 point there was a really big jump.

459
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:19.740
Tyler: Did you notice that.

460
00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:21.000
> P12: Yeah, yeah, I did.

461
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.309
Tyler: Okay, how did you feel when it had that really big jump?

462
00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:26.908
> P12: Yeah. Well, I was wondering,

463
00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:30.979
> P12: you know

464
00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:33.050
> P12: why it jumps so much.

465
00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:35.170
Tyler: but yeah.

466
00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:42.865
> P12: Yes, yes, it depends on the amount of contact you're putting in, or the amount of information you're putting in.

467
00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:44.360
Tyler: Okay.

468
00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:55.909
Tyler: so it's a little bit confusing. But you had maybe an idea why that might be happening. Did it make you think anything was wrong or anything, was not working correctly.

469
00:37:56.546 --> 00:37:57.480
> P12: No no.

470
00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:58.330
Tyler: Okay.

471
00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:00.370
> P12: No, I just figured out that

472
00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:02.990
> P12: it was it.

473
00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:10.209
> P12: The percentage of of the increase was based on the amount of information you put in.

474
00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:19.119
Tyler: Okay, got it. So you figure like, I put in this information. And now it's let me jump even further into the form. And I can maybe skip some things. Yeah.

475
00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:20.479
Tyler: that makes sense.

476
00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:35.952
Tyler: Okay? Well, I think you've answered pretty much all my questions. I'm really glad that it worked out to have you just go through it without sharing your screen. Cause. I think that probably saved us a little bit of a headache.

477
00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:43.160
Tyler: Is there anything else you wanted to share with me about about this tool, or about anything else that we talked about today?

478
00:38:43.890 --> 00:38:51.312
> P12: Oh, no, no. The only thing I'd like to just say again it was very easy to maneuver it. Maneuver.

479
00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:54.779
> P12: Yeah. And you guys did a great job with it.

480
00:38:55.110 --> 00:39:15.812
Tyler: Well, that's awesome. It's really really helpful for us to chat to people and to have you go through the form like you did today. That's the only way that it's working as well as it is right now. It's because we've done a lot of research with veterans. So I really appreciate you coming today. And I hope you continue to to sign up for research with the Va,

481
00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:20.829
Tyler: And yeah, that's everything from us. Thank you so much for your time, [P12].

482
00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:22.370
> P12: Okay, well, thank you.

483
00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:24.530
Tyler: Awesome. Have a good rest of your day. Okay.

484
00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:26.219
> P12: Okay. Alright. Take care.

485
00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:27.050
Tyler: Bye.

486
00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:28.400
Khoa: Thank you, [P12].

487
00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:29.639
