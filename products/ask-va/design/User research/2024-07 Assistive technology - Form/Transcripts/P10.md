### Warm up

### Warm up

Tyler: Alright. So I started the recording I just want to confirm, are you comfortable? If I record my screen and audio today.

2
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.930
> P10: Absolutely comfortable with recording screen and audio. Yes.

3
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:17.569
Tyler: Awesome thanks. So that was a lot of information. And we lot of we met a lot of different people. Do you have any questions for me at this point.

4
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:18.739
> P10: I do not.

5
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:19.980
Tyler: Okay, cool.

6
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:35.559
Tyler: Well, I, I said at the start, we'll have a bit of a chat at the beginning, and then we'll get started looking at this tool together. So before we do that, just curious to learn a little bit more about your experience. As a veteran, and with the Va how long have you been a veteran?

7
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.870
> P10: I retired in January 31st from the Marine Corps.

8
00:00:40.403 --> 00:00:50.120
> P10: So my experience with the Va. Would have started prior to that, because I was a wounded warrior injured from a suicide bombing attack in Afghanistan.

9
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:57.139
> P10: and I had started a Va. Claims process before my retirement. So my interactions with the Va.

10
00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.760
> P10: And VR and E, or Chapter 31 benefits started.

11
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.460
> P10: maybe

12
00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:10.580
> P10: 8 to 9 months prior to my retirement. So we're looking into like, you know. Maybe around this time

13
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:30.199
> P10: last year would have been. When I think I I 1st started to go through the claims process and then maybe backing up a little bit before that, when I had my 1st interaction with the Chapter 31 counselor who had explained to me the process that I actually could start VR and E. While I was being medically evaluated for continued service.

14
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:37.759
> P10: So short. Answer your question, it's been about 18 months entirety of full direct engagement with the

15
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.089
> P10: with the Va. And then, since then

16
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:54.489
> P10: pretty routine engagement, of course, with VR. And E. Counselor, as well as going through. Now my transition to retirement and then engagement for all of my health.

17
00:01:55.361 --> 00:01:58.879
> P10: Health mainly has been the focus. Health related issues for.

18
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.700
> P10: Things.

19
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:23.460
Tyler: Awesome that that background's really helpful. And also, interesting to know, like, it's been pretty recently that you've become a veteran. So you've been interacting like probably quite a bit more than maybe you will in 10 years or so. How are you getting in touch with the Va. Right now, like even, for example, your VR. And E. Counselor, how do you get in touch with your counselor?

20
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:32.619
> P10: Mainly through email is the engagement that we will will begin to communicate a topic, and then if it requires

21
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.760
> P10: a immediate check in or call that can happen

22
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.820
> P10: through telephone. And then

23
00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.319
> P10: I've had 3 video

24
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.360
> P10: Kella

25
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.930
> P10: conferences with with the with the Va. VR and E piece

26
00:02:49.811 --> 00:02:55.760
> P10: and I would just throw it out there right there. The least convenient mechanism that I've

27
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.409
> P10: encountered has been

28
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:06.609
> P10: a call at any time that I don't know it was planned or scheduled, but then I can't get

29
00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.169
> P10: I I have to take the call, no matter what, and I've literally been having a conversation

30
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.780
> P10: with very high level individuals, and I see the call, and I go. I've been waiting for this conversation.

31
00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:18.280
Tyler: For.

32
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:31.920
> P10: Month and a half, or or when it what might happen. So I have to say, I'm sorry, Mr. CEO, and I'll break off your information, but I have to take this call. So that is the very least convenient mechanism that I found has been the calls to me.

33
00:03:32.454 --> 00:03:39.269
> P10: Kind of like, hey? When I contact you, I'll contact you and like, Okay, and and as you can imagine.

34
00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:40.709
> P10: you know.

35
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:51.939
> P10: if you had a screaming baby in your hand. You're still gonna like, Hold my baby, and and take this call because it's so important. Yeah, whatever it may be. And and the fear would be if I go off grid, or if I'm not on

36
00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:04.479
> P10: my phone. Then I missed that call. I didn't even know that I missed the call, and it could be months that go by, and then it would almost be like it was my fault. You know, kind of like. Will we try to reach out to you, and we didn't hear from you.

37
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.129
> P10: I had no idea or so.

38
00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.441
> P10: Like that. So it's a very

39
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:18.660
> P10: It induces a little bit of worry which could translate to anxiety, which I have a lot of anxiety from many things. It's just one of those things that

40
00:04:19.255 --> 00:04:22.179
> P10: I've encountered in that short time that it's

41
00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:35.330
> P10: and it's not something that I share. Just independently. It's been things that I've conversed with other veterans about, and they're like, yep, that's how it's that's how it kind of works you just at the mercy of literally, they say, at the mercy of the Va. When they call you better be there.

42
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.919
> P10: Or otherwise you may have lost lost it.

43
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.040
Tyler: Yeah.

44
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.000
> P10: So I knew they just went on a little tirade there, but.

45
00:04:43.000 --> 00:05:06.390
Tyler: No, that was a really helpful. I wouldn't even call it a tangent or anything that's really related, and it's very helpful to understand, and like I can completely understand some of the like anxiety that that would in induce and trying to like you never know when someone's in a call. And then, all of a sudden, it might happen a month later. It's not like it's like the same day. Even so. It's part of that

46
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:14.600
Tyler: part of what makes that so hard? That you don't know. Obviously you don't know when it's coming. But also, you don't know, like the phone number that it's coming from.

47
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.459
> P10: Yes, the the phone, for

48
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.639
> P10: sometimes it'll say I'll get a I mean.

49
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:29.919
> P10: literally, I've been told by, like the Va. If you see a number that says 333 after it. Then then it's likely a Va. Number. So just look out for 333

50
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:35.750
> P10: and and then I've had a 333 number pick up, thinking it was the Va. And it was somebody different.

51
00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:36.350
Tyler: Hmm.

52
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:46.689
> P10: That didn't really work. But then the other aspect is like, sometimes I'll get it or literally say, Va community care. And I know that that's a you know, kind of like a call waiting from them.

53
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.870
Tyler: Right.

54
00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.249
> P10: Really yeah, just

55
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.639
> P10: me being me. I know that the

56
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:58.249
> P10: and and it sounds like what the you know kind of the process that that you're going through would be extremely beneficial with this

57
00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:06.149
> P10: aspect would be a portal that the veteran could log on to of like, Hey, this is my VR and E counselor, and they need to have this many wickets of

58
00:06:06.658 --> 00:06:09.940
> P10: you know, touch points or communicative process.

59
00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:20.120
> P10: And if there's like what green, yellow, red, and like the stoplight mechanism of like green. You're good. We have all the conversations yellow. There's some do outs, and then red. You're late. And.

60
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.550
Tyler: Yeah.

61
00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:39.340
> P10: Jeopardy of losing your benefit, or something along the lines of that that you could check on the portal and go. Oh, no, I don't have anything that that is due out that the counselor could update, of course, as well as like the veteran could put in input into and say, I'm working on getting this doctor's permission slip, or I'm I'm working on getting my grades from

62
00:06:40.218 --> 00:06:42.650
> P10: you know, my university

63
00:06:43.134 --> 00:06:51.669
> P10: those type of things I think could reduce that anxiety or worry that I'm talking about because it gives the gives me or the veteran interface to look at.

64
00:06:51.890 --> 00:07:00.339
> P10: And if it is routinely updated like it, you know, hopefully, would. Then you could. You could check it and go. I'm good. I don't need to worry about. Are they going to call me again.

65
00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:01.120
Tyler: Yeah.

66
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:13.910
> P10: Level. I know the email does work. But sometimes I mean, I was just doing it beforehand when I came back from this trip, going through the volume of emails. There's also that, did I miss it? Or did it go to junk or spam

67
00:07:14.525 --> 00:07:18.759
> P10: and the portal? I think we could alleviate some of that.

68
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.570
Tyler: Yeah, totally. Yeah. I mean, you're speaking to a couple of different

69
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:36.689
Tyler: issues, and maybe solutions like one is, there's information in different places like, there's a phone call over here. There's an email that I might miss. And it's hard to like, ha! Have a a full view on, like what you need to do.

70
00:07:36.967 --> 00:07:54.172
Tyler: And then also, just like a level of transparency like, you kind of have an idea that the Va. Knows what's going on. And it's just you trying to like, get that information from the Va. And that's a frustrating position to be in. So that that makes sense. I think your explanation of like what might help is is helpful.

71
00:07:54.470 --> 00:08:03.589
Tyler: have you ever contacted the Va, so obviously, we've talked about email, we've talked about the phone. Have you ever contacted the Va online in any other way?

72
00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:05.870
> P10: I have used

73
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.380
> P10: the va.gov

74
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.510
> P10: pretty extensively, so there's

75
00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:19.920
> P10: I guess that would be a mechanism of saying contact them. There may be things that I've used in there that I'm trying to recall.

76
00:08:21.184 --> 00:08:25.850
> P10: Like submission of claims, kind of thing, or checking on process

77
00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:40.479
> P10: that might have been it, but I don't know if I really communicated with them directly through it. So I'm like trying to think. Is there a chat option? I don't think I've ever used a chat option. If there was one, then I've missed it, but that would also be like of. I I like to use chat

78
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.759
> P10: and other. You know. I just use chat with Samsung, wasn't it?

79
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:44.470
Tyler: Really.

80
00:08:44.715 --> 00:08:57.210
> P10: It wasn't a really good experience with Samsung, but at least I was engaging with someone there, and the other thing I found that with a with a chat, and I was kind of gonna go back to what we were just talking about. If I have that portal up.

81
00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:58.890
> P10: or if I have the chat up

82
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:11.530
> P10: it, it builds back to me the confidence that I have something to show of a transcript to be able to say, no, I've already gone through this before. And this was the answer that I got from a an agent. And this is

83
00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:13.259
> P10: this is what I have. So

84
00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:18.379
> P10: you know, if you get a phone call from someone and they say, Hey, we're gonna we're trying to work with this referral.

85
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:24.529
> P10: And then 2 weeks later, he said, no, I got I I had a call, and they said they were gonna work, the firm they were like, we don't know what you're talking about that.

86
00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:36.915
> P10: Is 2 weeks of me not having anything where I can say. I need to escalate it, because I did talk with someone on August 19, th at 1115, and here's what it said. So it gives me again, and a little little bit more of

87
00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:42.389
> P10: hated to call you use this. But I've been using it for years now. But email to me is evidence mail kind of.

88
00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:47.449
> P10: And I go. Here's my evidence of that conversation. So the Chat Transcript would be the same sort of thing.

89
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:52.949
Tyler: Yeah, totally like that paper trail which I've heard from a lot of other veterans. It makes a lot of sense.

90
00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:59.779
> P10: We're as military. We're based, like, especially like guys guys and gals that have gone through like the senior leadership

91
00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:03.299
> P10: component of it. It's it's ingrained in us. So.

92
00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:16.960
> P10: You trust, but verify, and anybody any like marines that would come up to us, or anything like that they say like, Hey, I talked to, Sergeant Major, and we were like this like, I'm like you. I need to have something that that would show that you have that or.

93
00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:17.480
Tyler: I mean.

94
00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:24.409
> P10: Let you go on leave, you know, like trust, but verify. So it's it's kind of ingrained in this that you have some backing to a conversation.

95
00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:38.210
Tyler: Totally that that makes sense, are there. So you talked about. You've used chat bots before, and you just use it with Samsung. It wasn't a great experience. When like, do you decide to use a chat bot versus? Maybe not using one?

96
00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:41.119
Tyler: Is it like different scenarios? Or is it

97
00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:43.240
Tyler: anything question for me.

98
00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:49.290
> P10: It. It lies kind of back into that. I want to have some sort of conversation that I can

99
00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:51.040
> P10: fall back on

100
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:52.350
> P10: if needed.

101
00:10:52.934 --> 00:10:54.889
> P10: It's not that I'm looking for a trap

102
00:10:55.120 --> 00:11:01.890
> P10: or anything like that, but what I'm trying to do is find a hey just for transparency as we move forward

103
00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:04.440
> P10: just like you did with this recording of the session.

104
00:11:05.034 --> 00:11:14.820
> P10: I want to be able to recall back on what we said, and make sure that I'm accurate, and how I convey things as well as like. You know that anybody else can see it, and say

105
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:20.410
> P10: that this is accurate as well on the other side of the communication, so I will lean on the Chat Bot side

106
00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:22.189
> P10: over a phone call

107
00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:24.729
> P10: unless I need some.

108
00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:31.360
> P10: Let's get somebody personally on here because they're not understanding. You know, they're not understanding my conveyance, or

109
00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:42.800
> P10: there I I need to have somebody that that can act on this pretty quickly and get get very like almost personable about it and say, here is my sense of emergency.

110
00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:46.669
> P10: And this is my situation. Is there any way you can escalate it

111
00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:58.019
> P10: before I go into the chat bot, and then it's like, how can I help you? I'll work through a virtual assistant. Go through the frustrations. Pieces of that. Say, no, I need a representative. No, I need a agent, or whatever forever, until I actually get a live person

112
00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:07.320
> P10: which I can jump right into that. If you, if there were to be the role with with the chat bot piece I could see many other veterans. I'm a 45 year old, Guy.

113
00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.709
> P10: If my Dad, who is 73 were to try to do that

114
00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.040
> P10: no way.

115
00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:23.499
> P10: He's a like he. He wouldn't be able to handle that like a Vietnam veteran. He would. He would. He would like to be able to engage with you know, technology.

116
00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:27.459
> P10: But I I see him get frustrated with an iphone. So.

117
00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:27.830
Tyler: Right.

118
00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:34.360
> P10: That if he were to, if you were to say, Hey, your primary means is like use the chat, and then it went to a virtual assistance, and he said.

119
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:43.499
> P10: I need help with a disability claim, and then it, and then it went through. The virtual assistants like, ask these things. By the time I got to the second or 3rd layer he would probably throw the phone.

120
00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:46.149
> P10: And and just be frustrated by it.

121
00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:47.230
Tyler: Yeah.

122
00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:57.749
> P10: So I knew there was a lot right there, but I personally will lean to the chat bot again. When I want to have a transcript. I'll use a phone if I need to have personal interaction and try to like.

123
00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:04.169
> P10: get a quick response with something. And and maybe it's a little bit more of a complex situation.

124
00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:19.640
> P10: And then email again, if it's not so urgent. But I need to, of course, put attachments to things. And if I need to, you know, convey out a very descriptive. Here we go. Also use email for quick notes and just attachment. But

125
00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:25.790
> P10: my primary lean recently has been in most engagements to go with the chat because it just

126
00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:34.190
> P10: I don't have to wait for an email response. I don't have to wait on hold for a phone call for 3 h for something that

127
00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:37.719
> P10: can answer be answered with the chat. I don't mind sitting there with a chat.

128
00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:38.760
Tyler: Right.

129
00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:43.940
> P10: And I don't know if I'm jumping too much into this, but I'll also say the other frustration with the chat is connectivity.

130
00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:45.940
> P10: So

131
00:13:46.917 --> 00:13:50.649
> P10: one of the things that I was saying with the Samsung experience was.

132
00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:51.140
Tyler: That.

133
00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:53.019
> P10: You. It's almost like they.

134
00:13:53.120 --> 00:14:07.090
> P10: They designed it so that if you you'd wait 5 min for a response, and if you weren't there in 10 seconds, they say, Oh, look! Sounds like we were disconnected, and they disconnect the whole chat, and then you'd have to re-engage with somebody else about the entire thing.

135
00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.620
> P10: So if we had the time.

136
00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:09.000
Tyler: Right.

137
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:16.659
> P10: For an hour, for example, and I was explaining my situation about what was happening on with my device. This is going on the Samsung theme.

138
00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:21.329
> P10: and then we get to 50 min, and I was engaged with something else, and I looked back at the chat.

139
00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:26.059
> P10: And oh, I wasn't engaged, he responded. He disconnected the chat. And now I have to go back again.

140
00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:26.720
Tyler: Right.

141
00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.310
> P10: Re-explain the whole thing.

142
00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:31.289
> P10: And then, who knows? You're at the mercy of

143
00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:34.929
> P10: one answer to the other? Can they help you, or they have no idea.

144
00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:35.670
Tyler: Yeah.

145
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.630
Tyler: for sure. I mean, it's interesting. Just hearing you describe all those different

146
00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:43.876
Tyler: contact methods. And there's not really a perfect one.

147
00:14:44.340 --> 00:15:04.178
Tyler: in in terms of like, there's always a little bit of a like you can use email. But it's gonna take a while to respond like you can use the chat, but then you might end up in like a virtual chat. Bot situation where it's like gets complicated or like someone like your dad wouldn't wouldn't want to use that. So that's really interesting. I think this is all like really good foundation for what we're going to chat about today.

148
00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:29.099
Tyler: we are working on a tool that's a little bit different to a chat. Bot but it's also on the website. And it's a way of contacting the va, so we'll we'll get to that in a minute. I do want to transition and talk a little bit more about how you're using speechify. So I know a little bit of background. I've done a tiny bit of like checking for what speechify is but tell me a little bit about like how you found out about speechify. Why, you're using it

149
00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:34.420
Tyler: when you choose to use it versus when you don't need to use it. That kind of thing.

150
00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:36.689
> P10: Okay, great. So

151
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:42.169
> P10: I started at [university] in January, the month that I retired from the [branch].

152
00:15:42.828 --> 00:15:48.010
> P10: Pursuing a degree in uncrewed autonomous systems. So so drones, it's tech heavy.

153
00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:51.890
> P10: We got a lot of manuals and pubs that we have to read through.

154
00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:53.980
> P10: In.

155
00:15:54.130 --> 00:16:01.240
> P10: you know, back up to kind of like my medical stuff, and I don't mind, you know, bringing any of this stuff up. But like I said I was injured from a suicide. Bombing attack.

156
00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:11.009
> P10: Ia tbi from there is the the main reason. What brings me to to speechify, but like it.

157
00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:18.210
> P10: I was running into vision issues and memory retention issues and

158
00:16:18.812 --> 00:16:25.650
> P10: more specifically, headaches and migraines from from screen reading and looking at just a lot of

159
00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:37.120
> P10: it. It seemed like, whenever I was like reading a lot or in front of the screen. That's when I would have these vision issues led to the discovery of what was known to me already over the Tbi

160
00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:42.309
> P10: and I think maybe month 2 into the.

161
00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:50.640
> P10: You know my academic journey I I recognized. Hey, this is kind of this is hurting me. And I didn't want to.

162
00:16:50.670 --> 00:17:01.430
> P10: I actually didn't want to bring it up to my VR. And E. Counselor, because none of the things that I can do or doing during my VR. And E. Is supposed to exacerbate any of my known disabilities.

163
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.760
Tyler: Yeah.

164
00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:09.030
> P10: I didn't want to bring it up in fear that, hey? Maybe you're like you can't. I can't go to college because I can't look at screens and things like that without it causing me to have.

165
00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:09.999
Tyler: Right.

166
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:10.650
> P10: Friends.

167
00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:24.849
> P10: So I started looking into other options of how I could digest all of this material without reading. Really, it was like, I know I I know I can still read, but it's just when I'm going through so much volumes and sitting at the desk and reading so much.

168
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:26.969
> P10: It's caused me problems. And

169
00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:31.650
> P10: I just started searching around for other alternatives from text to speech.

170
00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:42.549
> P10: And also speech to text. I was also looking into that so that I I wouldn't have to sit there and actually type, and then look through it so much I can have dictation going through it.

171
00:17:43.397 --> 00:17:50.009
> P10: I wasn't able to get the solution for what I could afford for the dictation. But what I did find was speechify.

172
00:17:50.675 --> 00:17:52.529
> P10: And I think it had a trial.

173
00:17:53.290 --> 00:18:00.350
> P10: Speechify was helping me for the text to speech. Where we like. Read off what? What I you know, those those pubs.

174
00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:02.050
> P10: So

175
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:11.769
> P10: I became very interested with that free trial. And then, like instantly, I was like, Oh, my gosh! This is a game changer for me. Because I can

176
00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:14.540
> P10: not only not have to.

177
00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:30.030
> P10: it helps for me to look at the screen when I have speechify, because it does it does a follow on like you have the cursor that goes along with the, with the book or with the publication where it's reading and speaking. It'll like her, so I can follow along, and actually does help me when I'm following along. Get the retention of it.

178
00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:34.239
> P10: But I don't necessarily have to. I could almost listen to it like an audio book.

179
00:18:34.493 --> 00:18:41.300
> P10: And then I can still pick it up. And if I'm like, Okay, I'm not really getting that I can record back. And then maybe look at it as it's reading off, and I can retain it.

180
00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:51.380
> P10: So it has reduced my migraines significantly. It has reduced my eye strain significantly, and I think that

181
00:18:51.719 --> 00:18:57.650
> P10: all around it's been. It's been a game changer for me, and it's helped me maintain my 4 point O and.

182
00:18:57.650 --> 00:18:58.390
Tyler: Wow!

183
00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:06.848
> P10: That my professor, my professor in my class? I don't think he, you know it was like the 1st module, and I, I responded with all of these,

184
00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:09.160
> P10: very

185
00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:25.469
> P10: probably over the top level of responses. And they he was like, Are you using chat? Gpt? No, I'm not using chat. Vgpt, I just read through everything in our course materials already. And he was like, we just started this. It's a 9 week semester. And I'm like, I know, but

186
00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:27.290
> P10: speechify helps me do it.

187
00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:27.720
Tyler: And.

188
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.880
> P10: Speed up speechify to speed. Reader.

189
00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:36.550
> P10: okay, so imagine if that book was going to take you a week to read, you can read it now in 3 days, because.

190
00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:37.250
Tyler: Yes, it's.

191
00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:39.530
> P10: It's amazing what I'm able to pick up

192
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:46.180
> P10: and retain when it's going 3 times the speed where my wife has come in. And she's like that doesn't make any sense, and.

193
00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:46.690
Tyler: And like we.

194
00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:48.120
> P10: Be engrossed into it.

195
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:48.750
Tyler: Yeah.

196
00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:55.120
> P10: You're engrossed into it, and you listen to it. It actually can go very fast, and I can. I can still retain it, and it doesn't cause me the headaches. So

197
00:19:55.170 --> 00:20:03.720
> P10: it's kind of amazing to me. I can't. I don't even know what I pay for speechify to me. It's so valuable that I like. I haven't even looked back at if they.

198
00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:04.150
Tyler: Yeah.

199
00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:07.189
> P10: Like a hundred dollars a month. I would I would do it because, yeah.

200
00:20:08.018 --> 00:20:13.209
> P10: it's like a medical kind of thing for me and and like I, I love to be

201
00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:18.030
> P10: full as much as I almost want to be able to teach the course when I'm done with the course. So.

202
00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:21.300
> P10: Probably just how I've been in. You know my build up.

203
00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.159
Tyler: Yeah, so awesome.

204
00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:25.980
> P10: I know this like. I don't know if I answered it, how you wanted me to answer it.

205
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:45.809
Tyler: Yeah, you did. Yeah, totally. That's really helpful background. Just understanding like, what led you to need to realize you needed something like that. And also just awesome to hear that it has been so helpful for you. And like, I think I have a clear understanding of like how you're using it for reading materials. But what will be interesting today is to know if

206
00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:56.880
Tyler: at any point you feel like you would use speechify through like what we're using. Or if it's actually something you wouldn't need to use. And that's okay, too. So we can talk about that when we start to go through the the website.

207
00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:03.859
Tyler: Sure. 2 kind of like questions. It looks like you're probably on like a desktop or laptop computer. Is that right?

208
00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:05.399
> P10: Right now I'm on a desktop.

209
00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:09.720
Tyler: Okay? And what? Browser, do you usually use.

210
00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.340
> P10: Chrome.

211
00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:15.170
Tyler: Okay, cool. And are you on a Mac or a windows computer?

212
00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:15.930
> P10: Windows.

213
00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:17.100
Tyler: Okay, cool.

214
00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:26.750
Tyler: I just want to check Evan. Did you have any other questions? Oh, you know I have one more, and then I'll see if Evan has any other questions. When you're using speechify? Is it like a chrome extension?

215
00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:29.340
Tyler: Or how does it? Okay.

216
00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:33.540
> P10: To the website. And I just use speechify onto the website.

217
00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:38.820
> P10: If, say, I was on another computer. And I didn't have the ability to add apps

218
00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:41.820
> P10: and I can log in, and then it has my library.

219
00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:47.404
> P10: so I can build libraries of pubs through each course and

220
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:53.089
> P10: and then I have all of the books that are associated to that which is neat, and it kind of like I could fall back on it.

221
00:21:53.975 --> 00:22:00.810
> P10: But then the the extension is is very handy because it reads through every website.

222
00:22:01.568 --> 00:22:09.100
> P10: So the to kind of jump ahead and answer the question. I fully believe that it would work on the website because of the extension in chrome.

223
00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:23.420
> P10: because I use it all the time. And and all you have to do is with the extension open. Point the the cursor on it. And then. And I haven't really run into any issues. In that instance. And I can definitely tell you some of the things I have run into issues

224
00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:25.409
> P10: was featured by it. But,

225
00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:31.189
> P10: It's more simple than you'd think, but I don't know how they're going to fix it, but it's it's still like.

226
00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:36.000
> P10: If I'm weighing out like a problem for it, then I'll take. I'll take what they've got.

227
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:48.950
Tyler: Okay, yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, if the problems don't come up through the session, then we can chat about that sort of towards the end. That that's helpful, though, Evan, did you have any other questions about tech setup? Anything like that?

228
00:22:49.440 --> 00:23:00.509
Evan: Well, first, st I want to say it's awesome. How much speechify has helped you. Your coursework, I mean, that's amazing. That you read the whole coursework in like 3 days.

229
00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:01.939
> P10: 2, I gotta hit. So

230
00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:09.940
> P10: I was just telling Tyler I got back from a fly fishing excursion. That was a llama backcountry pack out in Melrose, Montana.

231
00:23:10.467 --> 00:23:23.492
> P10: Super cool experience. I would never been able to do it, but I was helped out by a organization called Warriors and quiet waters. So there's a Netflix movie on it called mending the line. Check it out, anyway. So so

232
00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:29.960
> P10: yeah, I was freaking out because I'm in college. And how am I going to do this? And then that's what led to. It is like I was like, well.

233
00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:40.080
> P10: if they give me 72 h before the course starts. I'm going to start 72 h before the course starts, and I did that. So as soon as the course opened up, I just dropped all of the assignments.

234
00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:47.329
> P10: and I was like, I'm kind of ready to stop submit for next week, and that's when he said, Hey, man, are you? Because this is

235
00:23:47.440 --> 00:24:02.660
> P10: like I'm I'm AI is, I guess, getting used throughout a lot of college now, and so when he hit me back about that. I was like, no, ask me any question you want about statistics, and I will. I'll give you like the answer. So he did. He's like, okay, I'm not worried about it all. You're one of those special cases, I guess.

236
00:24:03.066 --> 00:24:03.880
Evan: That's awesome.

237
00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:07.150
> P10: Yeah. And I recommend it to anybody, not just ones with like a

238
00:24:07.644 --> 00:24:13.479
> P10: medical stuff like me that they're able to tolerate listening at high speed of things, and

239
00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:14.869
> P10: I think it's beneficial.

240
00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:30.979
Evan: No, no, it definitely is not. I wanted to. Piggyback on that I'm not sure if you are familiar with like just the Mac OS platform. If you have dealt with apple products. They have a dictation built into the soft into the platform.

241
00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:56.220
Evan: They have a screen, reader, built into the platform. So you actually, once you purchase the whether it be a desktop laptop tablet. You would have those at your disposal, and you wouldn't have to pay a monthly fee. So that would be something I just want to put out to throw that out there to consider the dick. The the dictation is works well. That you're able to navigate websites just by talking

242
00:24:56.830 --> 00:25:15.050
Evan: And then a screen, reader, is great as well. You can speed it up to read as fast as you want. It'll track as well. The same with speechify. So I just wanted to throw that out there to see if you wanted to look into that but it's not like speechify is doing everything you need to do. But if you wanted to get a system that had it all in one. Then you could go to the to the Mac side.

243
00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:15.720
> P10: Me!

244
00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:16.450
Evan: Yeah.

245
00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:18.929
> P10: So I'd have to transfer over to Apple for that.

246
00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:23.070
Evan: No, look, look! If you already have a good system, stay with it. I mean.

247
00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:27.150
> P10: They give me another reason to complain to the Samsung, represent.

248
00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:28.245
Tyler: You know. Maybe.

249
00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:29.220
Evan: Second, phone.

250
00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:30.279
> P10: Thank you. Evan. Nope.

251
00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:31.429
Evan: No problem, no problem.

252
00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:44.659
Tyler: Thanks, Evan. So, [P10], the next thing we're going to do is get you set up sharing your screen. So this is just so that we can see you use the tool so if there's anything that you want to like, minimize on your computer, in the meantime, you're welcome to do that.

253
00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:51.200
> P10: Close my college stuff out because you guys don't want to see that

254
00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.050
> P10: Actually.

255
00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:03.659
> P10: you need me to have my browser open.

256
00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:05.674
Tyler: Yeah, we're gonna have chrome open.

257
00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:06.620
> P10: Okay.

258
00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:20.780
Tyler: And yeah, so you're welcome to open chrome. And if you prefer, you can actually get set up with the website first.st so I'll send you a link in the chat. On zoom and if you open up that link

259
00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:23.330
Tyler: in your browser.

260
00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:24.839
Tyler: that's what we're going to share.

261
00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:25.410
> P10: Okay.

262
00:26:27.415 --> 00:26:29.610
> P10: you said. It's coming through zoom.

263
00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:31.599
Tyler: Yeah through the zoom chat. Yeah.

264
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:32.840
Tyler: Gotcha.

265
00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:35.709
> P10: That's crazy, cause like it.

266
00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:39.680
> P10: There's AI in Zoom, you know, like AI is everywhere.

267
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:42.940
Tyler: Yeah, it really is. It feels like in the last, like, 2 months.

268
00:26:43.625 --> 00:26:46.709
> P10: I'm surprised. There's no AI on this Va website.

269
00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:50.381
Tyler: Yeah, I'm not an AI. Just so, you know.

270
00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:52.180
> P10: No, you're not haha.

271
00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:53.610
> P10: Okay.

272
00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:55.030
Tyler: Alright!

273
00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:55.800
> P10: I think I'm there.

274
00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:59.919
Tyler: Okay, cool. So then let's go ahead and share your screen on zoom. Have you done that before?

275
00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:00.970
> P10: I have not.

276
00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:04.880
Tyler: Okay. So if you come back to Zoom, where you can see my face.

277
00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:15.249
Tyler: When you're at that window, you're gonna have some controls at the bottom of your screen, so it'll say, like audio video. And then in the middle, it'll say share.

278
00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:23.290
Tyler: So if you click share, then another window is going to pop up. It's going to ask you to choose what you want to share, so you can try and find that link you just opened.

279
00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:27.910
> P10: Think so, for whatever reason it looked like it opened in edge, though

280
00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:30.250
> P10: you wanted to open the chrome right.

281
00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:33.499
Tyler: Well, it's up to you wherever wherever you want to use it.

282
00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:38.309
> P10: Weird. It's like the default went to Edge.

283
00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:43.940
> P10: You know what? I'm going to copy the link and post it and and paste it in chrome.

284
00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:44.910
Tyler: Yeah, perfect.

285
00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:47.769
> P10: And go there.

286
00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:51.879
> P10: See what this looks like. Now.

287
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:56.340
> P10: close that out.

288
00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:04.610
> P10: I really rarely ever use edge. That's why I just wanted to go with chrome, because this is what I would typically use.

289
00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:05.470
Tyler: Yeah, that that.

290
00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:07.279
> P10: Try it on h 2, if you want, but.

291
00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:09.970
Tyler: Let's do, Chrome, if that's what you usually use.

292
00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:12.850
> P10: okay, I think that.

293
00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:19.839
Tyler: Okay, perfect, awesome. So now I can see your screen. It says, Ask Va, perfect.

### Form

Tyler: Alright. So I'll tell you a little bit more about this tool, now that we've got it up on the screen.

295
00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:34.100
Tyler: so this is called, ask Va it's a way for veterans to contact the Va and ask a question online.

296
00:28:34.672 --> 00:28:42.659
Tyler: For the session. Today, we're gonna pretend, like you're asking the Va a question. And let's just say it's a question about healthcare.

297
00:28:44.100 --> 00:29:05.069
Tyler: I can remind you of the scenario as we go along, or whenever you need me to and basically, as you navigate, we kind of want to understand what's going through your mind. And in your case, like, if there are moments when you would want to use speechify and if there's not moments, maybe, why, you don't feel like you need to use it as you're going through this process.

298
00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:05.890
> P10: Okay.

299
00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:10.650
Tyler: Do you have any questions for me about ask Va. Or about what we're going to do next?

300
00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:11.990
> P10: And.

301
00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:18.590
Tyler: Okay, cool. So when you're ready, go ahead and get started. Asking the Va, your question.

302
00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:19.790
> P10: Okay.

303
00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:30.746
> P10: so none of this. I would use feature 5, 4, of course, going through it because it doesn't have a large volume of

304
00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:35.339
> P10: Words to read. We can just go through this pretty quickly.

305
00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:39.359
> P10: I'm gonna try to go. This.

306
00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:42.330
> P10: does it just make sense. So just go VR, and e.

307
00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:57.579
Tyler: I'm gonna actually sorry. I think if you do that it'll it'll be unhappy with you. And that's just because it's a a prototype. So are you choosing VR and E, because, like, it's familiar to you, that's usually how you contact the Vi is through the VR and E like program.

308
00:29:58.605 --> 00:30:03.210
> P10: It's just that it's familiar to me. I I literally just went to to pick it as like.

309
00:30:04.032 --> 00:30:10.910
> P10: I haven't done any of the other stuff, really. So maybe disability compensation I have done. But however, you want me to.

310
00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:18.695
Tyler: Yeah, no worries it. This is kind of the the funny part of of testing. So it we're going to choose healthcare today.

311
00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:30.820
Tyler: I I wouldn't worry too much about it, and it's it's helpful to see you go through the the list, and you pretty quickly found one that was familiar. So if you have any other comments on the list, you're welcome to

312
00:30:31.437 --> 00:30:34.239
Tyler: otherwise we can continue with healthcare.

313
00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:38.899
> P10: I'm I'm just now going back through it like, Okay, these are.

314
00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:51.800
> P10: I like the ones that are in here. I'm just wondering about the ones that are absent on that list. But anyway, that's that that's great. It is relatively easy for me to navigate through it.

315
00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:55.640
Tyler: Yeah, what do you feel like is absent like what kind came to mind right away.

316
00:30:56.251 --> 00:30:57.999
> P10: And nothing. That's what I was.

317
00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:58.480
Tyler: Okay.

318
00:30:58.480 --> 00:30:59.477
> P10: Look through it.

319
00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:02.100
> P10: I see like healthcare.

320
00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:06.980
> P10: I guess that would also

321
00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:10.210
> P10: encompass vision. Maybe I don't know.

322
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:12.030
> P10: But

323
00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:18.500
> P10: yeah, I am.

324
00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:24.090
> P10: I can't. I'm lost at trying to find something that I would try to engage with the Va. That's not on this list.

325
00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:25.419
Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

326
00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:39.820
> P10: Said, it's like you don't know what you don't know. And I like, for this is a great example. I didn't even know there was technolog tech assist programs. The Va like, there was anything like that until

327
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.630
> P10: recently. Actually, my counselor brought it up.

328
00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:49.160
> P10: My VR. And E counselor brought it up that maybe like it would. She's like, maybe it would be benefit that the Va. Helped you with some of the tech stuff.

329
00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:51.530
> P10: So that that.

330
00:31:51.530 --> 00:32:02.859
Tyler: That's a really, yeah, that scenario is really interesting to me. Actually, if we can just use it as an example, real quick, like, if your VR. Any counselor said that to you, and they were like, okay, like, go get in touch with the Va.

331
00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:14.789
Tyler: Use. Ask Va and ask them about getting like some tech assistance. If you were going to do that, and you saw this list of options, which option do you think you would choose for that.

332
00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:16.669
> P10: In this list of options.

333
00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:29.349
> P10: At 1st I could see somebody saying sign in and technical issues, but maybe not.

334
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:30.483
> P10: Might go.

335
00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:35.939
> P10: you know it's not. I don't, not having technical issues, but I need technical assistance. So those 2 things might come.

336
00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:40.460
> P10: They might. You have to like, clarify between, like tech assisted.

337
00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:43.920
> P10: you know, programs, or or on that line.

338
00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:47.090
> P10: Benefit issues.

339
00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:49.239
> P10: Actually, there isn't 1.

340
00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:55.329
Tyler: Okay, yeah, that's sort of what I was wondering that that's a helpful scenario, then. Well, let's.

341
00:32:55.963 --> 00:32:56.596
> P10: Maybe

342
00:32:57.290 --> 00:32:59.580
> P10: However, it would be labeled, or something like

343
00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:10.250
> P10: I guess you guys could figure that out, or I can't think of it. But there, there it is like she actually didn't even say

344
00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:22.799
> P10: go to the Va. So she might not even known. She told me her advisement was to reach out to the school's disability counselor to see if the disability counselor at the school would be able to provide me any type of.

345
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:23.760
Tyler: Assistance.

346
00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:24.340
> P10: For

347
00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:26.809
> P10: text to speech.

348
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.610
> P10: Got it? Yeah.

349
00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:49.740
Tyler: Okay, cool. Yeah, that's helpful. Just to kind of understand how you might be thinking through the list in a in a more real scenario. So let's let's continue with healthcare, and I'll I'll try not to interrupt too much on the next screen. You can choose whichever option you like so you can give me your thoughts on this page just like you did before.

350
00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:51.304
> P10: Okay,

351
00:33:54.810 --> 00:34:06.240
> P10: I'm just gonna play off an example that I I did earlier this morning. And it was kind of like I had questions about billing and copays. And I went to the providers specifically. But

352
00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:09.570
> P10: so I had questions about buildings and copays.

353
00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:13.000
> P10: What is the question about be for me.

354
00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:15.910
> P10: I'm the veteran.

355
00:34:18.469 --> 00:34:20.030
> P10: and I you want me to put mine.

356
00:34:20.862 --> 00:34:23.789
Tyler: Yeah, or you could. If you don't want to put yours, you can put something else.

357
00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:24.630
> P10: I don't know.

358
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:34.320
> P10: Okay, now here is confusion.

359
00:34:35.409 --> 00:34:40.829
> P10: Like. Select the Va. Facility. [city] 2. Va. What does that mean? 3 Va. 4. Va. Like.

360
00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:41.560
Tyler: Hmm.

361
00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:43.129
> P10: I don't know what

362
00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:46.489
> P10: I know of one [location] clinic.

363
00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:53.530
> P10: So when it says 2 Va. 3, but like that to me, I'm right instantly like, what are we talking about here? Right?

364
00:34:53.909 --> 00:35:02.690
> P10: So obvious. The rest of them are really clear cut. You got one in [location], one in [location] to go still, don't know what these things are, so.

365
00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:03.140
Tyler: Yeah.

366
00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:05.199
> P10: I'm stuck on that. Yeah.

367
00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:19.540
Tyler: To be honest, I haven't seen that before. And so this is really helpful to see this example. And I also think that's very confusing. What do you think you would do if you were in this scenario like you don't know which one to choose between? Maybe these 4

368
00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.280
Tyler: options at the top.

369
00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:22.430
> P10: That one right there.

370
00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:23.120
Tyler: Okay.

371
00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:30.210
> P10: Or I would actually just circumvent it and go to [location], because for me, in my position, I'm

372
00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:34.750
> P10: I'm like we're in the middle ground where I can go to be the [location] or the [location] one.

373
00:35:34.930 --> 00:35:38.819
> P10: So I might look at all this nonsense, and just go forget that.

374
00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:39.150
Tyler: Okay.

375
00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:44.110
> P10: And run into problems with this because they're gonna say, you, you're at the wrong location or something like that, like.

376
00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:45.979
> P10: Only one

377
00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:50.539
> P10: So honestly, I think I would probably just be like.

378
00:35:50.570 --> 00:35:53.330
> P10: I know there's assistance here.

379
00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:55.130
> P10: but I'm gonna go there.

380
00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:58.599
Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. Just play it safe and choose the other one.

381
00:35:59.270 --> 00:35:59.900
Tyler: Cool.

382
00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:03.119
Tyler: That makes sense. You can continue when you're ready.

383
00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:07.609
> P10: I don't understand what this. Okay, wait.

384
00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:12.550
> P10: I thought I clicked on the [location] one.

385
00:36:13.570 --> 00:36:14.670
Tyler: Yeah.

386
00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:15.790
> P10: Here.

387
00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:18.040
> P10: Whoa! What just happened?

388
00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:38.139
Tyler: I'll try and explain what just happened, because part of it was just like a a bug with the prototype. So I think you. You were in the list of options you chose [location], and then, instead of clicking, continue like onto the next page, you clicked next, which showed you like the next page of results.

389
00:36:38.398 --> 00:36:57.529
Tyler: And you're not the 1st person that's done that. It's obviously the buttons are a little too close together, and it's not obvious which one to choose and then when you clicked back, then it was a bug with the prototype where it just like jumped you to the jumped you forward. So now we're here a little bit of confusing way to get here. But you can go ahead and continue.

390
00:36:57.530 --> 00:37:01.329
> P10: Something there that like, if you know, yeah, if I see next

391
00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:04.740
> P10: and continue, they're synonymous. So.

392
00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:05.310
Tyler: Totally.

393
00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:11.507
> P10: which one is it? And if it's going to drive me down the wrong path, then yeah, I you know. Maybe

394
00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:13.810
> P10: you know.

395
00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:22.289
> P10: Just have the 1, 2, 3 thing for for lists out, and then and then next would mean next page, or or continue with it. That's my selection.

396
00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.840
> P10: Yeah, that is weird.

397
00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:25.009
Tyler: That makes sense.

398
00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:30.819
Tyler: And then this page, there's already some information that's been filled in.

399
00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:41.400
Tyler: and this is because I'm just gonna let you know, because it's a little confusing. We're pretending like you signed in today. So this information would be your phone number and be your email address.

400
00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:53.530
> P10: Okay, yeah, well, that makes sense. So then how should we contact you? For me? I prefer to see the email. Because again, like how I described like the phone call, I don't know when and how you're going to call me. But if you email and say

401
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:56.320
> P10: our contact time is going to be this, that's great.

402
00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:05.230
> P10: and all of this is really clear cut

403
00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:08.030
> P10: other than, Well, yeah, there we go.

404
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:09.229
> P10: I don't know what that

405
00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:13.076
> P10: it was just like the the gender thing, and

406
00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:14.509
Tyler: And comment on it.

407
00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:16.649
> P10: I thought I said Z, or something like that. I don't know.

408
00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:18.960
Tyler: Oh, okay. So you were surprised by one of the options.

409
00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:20.930
> P10: That's it, that's all. And I'm sure that

410
00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:25.468
> P10: many other people are going to go. Oh, yeah, what is that? I don't know.

411
00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:27.899
> P10: but that's okay, that it's on there. It is

412
00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:31.079
> P10: nothing else other than just it invoked a little bit of.

413
00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:35.640
> P10: Now I'm curious of a z gender.

414
00:38:36.122 --> 00:38:37.570
Tyler: Yeah, that's fair.

415
00:38:39.783 --> 00:38:40.870
> P10: Okay, so

416
00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:46.310
> P10: I don't receive mail outside of the Us.

417
00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:49.799
> P10: And I thought we did this already.

418
00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:51.020
> P10: Or is this

419
00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:52.310
> P10: asking

420
00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:56.929
> P10: your postal code. I don't check that box. It wants me to put

421
00:38:57.070 --> 00:38:58.819
> P10: my postal code in again.

422
00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:00.690
> P10: Okay.

423
00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:05.919
> P10: I feel like there's redundancy here that causes a little confusion.

424
00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:06.950
Tyler: Yeah.

425
00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:10.120
> P10: [postal code] Only because I'm like, wait.

426
00:39:10.210 --> 00:39:14.169
> P10: we literally put it in my postal code earlier in this right?

427
00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:16.660
> P10: Or am I wrong? Yeah. So then

428
00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:21.530
> P10: I could see it saying, if I needed to check this box I would have to put that in.

429
00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:22.230
Tyler: Yeah.

430
00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:24.410
> P10: But if I don't have that, then.

431
00:39:24.690 --> 00:39:33.170
Tyler: Yeah, okay. So that's really interest all that makes sense. That's very interesting. And you're not the 1st person who's noticed that. So

432
00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:37.179
Tyler: did it feel like it was asking for your postcode. If you live on a military base.

433
00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:52.009
> P10: I felt like it was asking me for a postal code if I lived on a military base, Ocona. So outside the Continental us and I was on base, and I needed to put in my address to receive correspondence there. Sure, yeah, I didn't. So it was almost like.

434
00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:58.520
> P10: if you check that box. Then the other one, the other option would open up to put the Zip code. If you didn't next.

435
00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:01.400
Tyler: Right? That makes sense. Okay, that's helpful.

436
00:40:04.770 --> 00:40:05.919
> P10: this is clear cut.

437
00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:08.639
> P10: If you got a question you put, this is like the free

438
00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:10.749
> P10: free rate space of like.

439
00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:12.400
> P10: This is my question.

440
00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:18.670
> P10: Yeah, I mean it. It makes sense

441
00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:32.219
> P10: here. I almost wonder if there could have been a little bit of flushing out in the beginning of like, what is your question? Here's a category. Oh, you're not even in the right spot. So if I, in other words, trying to look for Va tech assistance, and I started to go through the whole process.

442
00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:33.570
> P10: And then I got to this.

443
00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:46.470
> P10: And then they're like you needed to contact the the tech assistance department. And that's this like great. I just wasted 20 min of my time. So maybe, like the what's your question or what's your purpose can get flushed out at the beginning.

444
00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:52.069
Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. So kind of starting with your question, and then that might help you help, like

445
00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:54.599
Tyler: us know who you should be put in touch with.

446
00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:55.200
> P10: Yes.

447
00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:55.860
Tyler: Yes.

448
00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:58.740
> P10: Ultimately the beginning of this

449
00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:00.760
> P10: inquiry process

450
00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:04.279
> P10: can start the line of frustration. And

451
00:41:04.795 --> 00:41:06.495
> P10: I think for me,

452
00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:14.080
> P10: What what I mean by. That is like, you know, if I if I were to go down these paths and then I get to the point where oh, wait! You gotta get to that other one

453
00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:23.270
> P10: like, I just wasted 20 min. And I was trying to do this. And I have so much time I'm gonna have to come back to it later. And I I would actually just push away and and maybe get to it.

454
00:41:23.310 --> 00:41:29.800
> P10: It might be something that takes a long time, so getting me to where I know that I need to be is very imperative.

455
00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:35.070
> P10: That would be. That would be something. I would if it works with this. Now.

456
00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:44.760
> P10: if the the free right what's your question at the end makes sense sure I do. I do think that it makes sense to be able to like. Put it out there like, what do you need? But maybe, like a

457
00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:52.210
> P10: you get what I'm saying, like, you know, figure it out, structure it to to be able to to get make sure in the right department 1st shot.

458
00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:54.449
Tyler: Yeah, that totally makes sense.

459
00:41:57.230 --> 00:42:04.909
Tyler: on this page like you can, just you'll have to type in something. But if you want, you could just type in like test or you can type in a question

460
00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:16.070
Tyler: awesome.

461
00:42:17.556 --> 00:42:18.870
> P10: Health care.

462
00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:22.720
> P10: Okay.

463
00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:30.052
> P10: so this is confirmation of everything that I put in there, it is the Z, 0, I never heard that one. That's why I was like what

464
00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:31.479
> P10: that's interesting.

465
00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:33.269
> P10: I'm gonna have to look it in

466
00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:35.070
> P10: so

467
00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:37.990
> P10: yep, this is clear, you want ready for me to push it.

468
00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:39.319
Tyler: Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

469
00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:46.999
Tyler: So you went through that page and you sort of skimmed your information and then clicked submit. Do you think that's usually what you would do like if I wasn't here.

470
00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:51.339
> P10: Yes. Oh, yeah, I definitely would look through the make sure that I had

471
00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:55.260
> P10: entered, and everything. What I didn't see is go back. Was there a go back.

472
00:42:58.570 --> 00:43:03.370
Tyler: I'm gonna not answer the question. But are you? Are you wondering if that if you want.

473
00:43:03.370 --> 00:43:10.739
> P10: Okay. So what I'll say is, if I did review that. And I was like, Wait a minute. I typed in my phone number. Wrong. Could I go back and re edit

474
00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:18.589
> P10: because I didn't? I didn't see the button, but I'm not saying it wasn't there. I'm just curious. If if there was an option, or if it was like, no taxi back sees. And

475
00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:21.010
> P10: you're just this. This is what they're gonna get.

476
00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:39.289
Tyler: Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. That's totally fair, that especially when you're like in a skimming mindset that you might have just like not noticed. But there is an edit button. So you can edit some information on that page. But you can't edit everything. So that's that's sort of how that one works. Yeah.

477
00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:40.760
> P10: Okay. Yep.

478
00:43:41.090 --> 00:43:43.940
Tyler: And now we're on this page. So tell me about this page.

479
00:43:46.265 --> 00:43:47.270
> P10: So

480
00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:53.490
> P10: I would be jumping right to my email and hitting refresh right now, looking for the confirmation.

481
00:43:54.930 --> 00:43:55.560
Tyler: Okay.

482
00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:58.340
> P10: Just off of this. I like, I like again, I wrote.

483
00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:05.969
> P10: I love that email evidence mail component of it. So I'd be looking at it so that way. I knew that there was some sort of communication

484
00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:08.549
> P10: connection that did happen.

485
00:44:09.355 --> 00:44:15.230
> P10: And also I could go. Hey? No. I tried to ask this question back in August, and now it's September, and I haven't heard anything.

486
00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:23.059
> P10: So it would also look for that would be one of the 1st things I would do. I do appreciate this. I like the green and the check mark. It makes me feel like

487
00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:29.140
> P10: success, you know, like that that. Those things were all you know, kind of like a good feeling on to it.

488
00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:41.430
> P10: yeah. So the end of the process. It's like, okay, I think everything's done right. And you know. So, tying in the previous page to look through the screen to to go there. Now do I feel like

489
00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:48.329
> P10: my inquiry about text or tech would get to if I went to the Health Department. I don't.

490
00:44:49.350 --> 00:44:52.639
> P10: If I wrote in that question, hey? I'm looking for technical assistance.

491
00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:54.570
> P10: It's a crapshoot.

492
00:44:54.680 --> 00:45:08.470
> P10: I think that it would be a crap shoot on whoever I got. If it was a you know a Va representative that was like, you know what this person's writing about tech assistance, and I'm not the department, but I'm going to reach out to that veteran and say, Hey, I'm not the department. Maybe you need to seek somewhere else.

493
00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:12.550
> P10: That's the crap shoot, or if they go, that ain't me and

494
00:45:13.130 --> 00:45:16.139
> P10: file 13, they don't even is like, not my problem.

495
00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:16.694
Tyler: And

496
00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:21.940
> P10: And and like. I don't know what this guy's talking about, but we're health, not tech. And they just don't do anything

497
00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:33.680
> P10: right. That's where, I say is a crapshoot. It's like I feel like this feels good. That the the ask went out doesn't necessarily give me the warm and fuzzy that it got to the right department, nor

498
00:45:33.830 --> 00:45:37.519
> P10: going to get any type of real response back.

499
00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:42.259
Tyler: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I think there's like 2 things you mentioned that I wanted

500
00:45:42.370 --> 00:45:44.880
Tyler: sort of focus on a little bit more.

501
00:45:45.256 --> 00:46:01.389
Tyler: One of them is obviously like your concern. You still don't know who your question is going to. Which is obviously a concern. What do you think would like make you less like what would give you some reassurance at that? At this point about that.

502
00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:08.000
> P10: Well, what does give me a A bit of reassurance, is it? Says we'll reply by email within 7 business days.

503
00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:12.660
> P10: I'm not confident that it's going to be an automatically generated.

504
00:46:12.850 --> 00:46:14.879
> P10: or if it's going to be a.

505
00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:15.510
Tyler: Okay.

506
00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:17.509
> P10: They actually reviewed

507
00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:19.710
> P10: email, like, I'm still kind of like.

508
00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:21.500
> P10: curious on

509
00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:27.870
> P10: what quality of response I would get if that if that makes sense.

510
00:46:28.832 --> 00:46:45.429
> P10: So it does feel. Make me feel good like this, says, right there you will receive a reply within 7 business days. So I'm I'm feeling like I'm gone. I'm expecting now some sort of reply, but in my head I go. It's it's probably going to be one of those things that say, you know your your question has been

511
00:46:46.066 --> 00:46:47.059
> P10: you know

512
00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:52.169
> P10: your question has been received, and our our processing team is going through it.

513
00:46:52.598 --> 00:46:56.779
> P10: And then, almost like another, follow on, or it may even give me like a

514
00:46:57.500 --> 00:47:09.510
> P10: something else that I need to do with it. And I got buried in an email. So the next step which would fall back onto me gets kicked to me in some sort of automatic email that if I didn't do it, then it gets lost on deaf, deaf ears.

515
00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:26.231
Tyler: Right? Got it. That makes sense. So at this point, having never used this before, you're very like curious about what actually, you're gonna get out of it. And it sounds like it would be a disappointment if it felt like it was an automated email. Yeah, that that makes a lot of sense.

516
00:47:26.530 --> 00:47:29.680
> P10: I would be putting this on my calendar for me to follow up.

517
00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:31.030
Tyler: Okay. Yeah.

518
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:39.640
> P10: Yeah, that that's something absolutely. I would I would do, certainly, if it was like of pretty good importance if I was like going back to the theme of

519
00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:43.460
> P10: Hey, I was writing to the Va. About like, How can I get some

520
00:47:43.570 --> 00:47:45.150
> P10: text to speech

521
00:47:45.310 --> 00:47:48.919
> P10: assistance? And I went this mechanism?

522
00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:55.169
> P10: I would be putting on there in 2 weeks. Now follow back up with the Va. And the next time I would be calling.

523
00:47:55.810 --> 00:47:56.749
Tyler: Got it?

524
00:47:56.750 --> 00:48:05.279
> P10: With the evidence. Mail hey? I reached out. You said you were going to give me a contact within 7 business days. I don't know if I got it, or if I went to my spam.

525
00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:07.610
> P10: you know sometimes

526
00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:12.100
> P10: it could be not directly from the Va. It might be like, Hey.

527
00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:17.710
> P10: You know, these other technology companies gonna call me up. And I'm like, who are we?

528
00:48:18.210 --> 00:48:25.590
> P10: And I gotta be honest, I had to look back up your, the company that you guys are doing the survey through. Because that's how it came into my email. It was.

529
00:48:25.590 --> 00:48:26.120
Tyler: Yeah.

530
00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:27.859
> P10: Wait! What company is this?

531
00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:28.270
Tyler: Yeah.

532
00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:35.709
> P10: You know I didn't. I didn't. I didn't know. So so the Va. Could kick me out in theory. Some other business reply. But it's something that's

533
00:48:35.830 --> 00:48:40.670
> P10: straight up like here's speechify. And if I didn't know what speechify was then, I'd be like.

534
00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:41.630
> P10: But.

535
00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:43.190
> P10: I.

536
00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:48.629
Tyler: Right, you would lose all the context of like, how this came to be and stuff. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

537
00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:56.270
> P10: Yeah. So for me, it would be a calendar event, and then a recontact that I would. I would have to follow up with.

538
00:48:56.547 --> 00:49:13.502
Tyler: Gotcha, yeah, that makes sense. So you'd be like paying attention like pretty close attention to like, they said, it would be 7 business days. It's been 7 business days. Now, I'm gonna get back in touch. Yeah, that that's really helpful. The other thing I wanted to kind of focus on that you mentioned earlier. Was this like

539
00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:39.869
Tyler: going back to this idea of a paper trail and like needing that like evidence mail? And you said, like. As soon as you saw this you would be refreshing your email to make sure that you got the email confirmation. And that makes total sense like, especially given everything you shared with me earlier. I'm wondering, like in this scenario you've signed in to ask your question. Do you feel like your question is going to be saved anywhere else. Besides your email.

540
00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:50.130
> P10: On my side of the fence or on the is it? I guess the question is.

541
00:49:50.130 --> 00:49:51.650
Tyler: On your side. Yeah.

542
00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:54.170
> P10: And on my side I wouldn't.

543
00:49:55.670 --> 00:50:07.879
> P10: I have screenshotted things so I may screenshot this just because it said it was going to it, if like, I refresh and I refresh. And I'm waiting 20 min and it doesn't come. Then I'm screenshotting this, because before

544
00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:13.670
> P10: I saw, hey, I wrote my email correctly. And I had my number correctly on that thing, and it says you're gonna

545
00:50:13.770 --> 00:50:15.719
> P10: send it in 20 min.

546
00:50:15.970 --> 00:50:18.330
> P10: Conceivably I should be getting something.

547
00:50:18.690 --> 00:50:25.809
> P10: So I also would. I also would leave this web page up just where it's at and screenshot it. So I had that thing like, there's my confirmation number

548
00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:35.329
> P10: You know. So that's another plus another positive, though there is a confirmation number. There's some sort of reference number, or there's something that I can refer back to

549
00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:38.850
> P10: when I'm trying to communicate again, if there is a problem.

550
00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:42.650
> P10: So there, like I use snippet tool pretty often.

551
00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:46.729
Tyler: Okay, got it. So just like the fact that you have.

552
00:50:47.110 --> 00:51:13.679
Tyler: I mean it all kind of connects. But the fact that you have the confirmation number. And you can track like this thing that's happened. And you would probably take like a screenshot of it. And then you'd wait for that email confirmation. That that makes a lot of sense. You are totally welcome to keep sharing your screen. But we've actually reached the end of the the tool now, so you also can stop sharing your screen if you prefer, and we'll just chat for the next like 10 min before we finish.

553
00:51:14.010 --> 00:51:14.640
> P10: Okay.

554
00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:18.139
Tyler: If you want to stop sharing, there's like a a red.

555
00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:18.799
> P10: I see it. Yeah.

556
00:51:18.997 --> 00:51:19.590
Tyler: There you go.

557
00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:20.620
Tyler: perfect!

### Cool down

Tyler: So zooming out a little bit. How was that experience for you?

559
00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:42.000
> P10: Going through it. Is very simple and I wouldn't say it's clear cut, because there was some convolution there of like, what are we doing? And then, as you saw, like it, the flush out of like the

560
00:51:42.050 --> 00:51:44.040
> P10: multiple [location] clinics.

561
00:51:44.970 --> 00:51:46.010
> P10: That literally would.

562
00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:51.739
> P10: If I didn't have the options of [location], [location], [location], or the other ones there

563
00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:53.889
> P10: I would be

564
00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:57.200
> P10: in a bit of turmoil. Just who who I am.

565
00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:57.580
Tyler: Because.

566
00:51:57.580 --> 00:52:02.969
> P10: Again. I want to make sure I'm doing it like the right way the 1st time, and it's nothing that's like my problem.

567
00:52:02.970 --> 00:52:03.740
Tyler: Yeah.

568
00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:07.332
> P10: It may be just me, but I I hate

569
00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:11.926
> P10: I hate wasting time. I like doing everything with a purpose, and

570
00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:13.853
> P10: I hate.

571
00:52:14.330 --> 00:52:16.904
> P10: I just. I really despise

572
00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:22.049
> P10: inefficiency and incompetency. It. It makes me like

573
00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:24.260
> P10: I have to just kind of take

574
00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:30.579
> P10: Wusa breaths and step back from the whole situation like her to walk into it and be like, there's 4 things here.

575
00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:34.489
> P10: And I I've got like a 25% chance. I'm clicking on the right one.

576
00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:39.200
> P10: and then I click on the right one, and I go through this whole thing and like, drive to [location]. And I'd show up. And they're like.

577
00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:50.639
> P10: Yeah, you're supposed to click option 2 or something. Then it then it would I. I all of those things that I discussed about time, management, and efficiency and competency would

578
00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:54.729
> P10: I would be venting to my wife, and she would be like yay, you know, like.

579
00:52:55.490 --> 00:52:56.250
Tyler: Yeah.

580
00:52:56.250 --> 00:52:57.470
> P10: It won't get yeah. So.

581
00:52:57.470 --> 00:52:58.190
Tyler: Yeah.

582
00:52:58.370 --> 00:52:59.234
> P10: But

583
00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:08.759
> P10: I am somewhat of a fan of like. It's simple in the sense of that. There's not a whole lot of stuff going on on that screen.

584
00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:09.540
Tyler: Right.

585
00:53:10.090 --> 00:53:20.420
> P10: Which makes me also wonder, because there's not a lot of things on the screen. There's like, Hey, page one, page 2, page 3. Wasn't really like more highlighted, and it was like a next and continue thing.

586
00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:21.130
Tyler: Yeah.

587
00:53:21.130 --> 00:53:31.720
> P10: Less is more in so many ways, and then web design to me in in this instance, like less, can be more just, have more pages like that would, if you want to convey the information and more questions.

588
00:53:32.270 --> 00:53:35.360
> P10: Big, blocky, checky things.

589
00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:36.980
> P10: not just for me, but like

590
00:53:37.050 --> 00:53:43.060
> P10: again using my dad as an example, is like a kind of an older gentleman not super tech heavy.

591
00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:47.679
> P10: I mean, rotary phone is what you know like, that's what he grew up in. And.

592
00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:54.260
> P10: Now like to have smartphones and everything else. It's it's he wants to be able to utilize it, but just get gets lost into it.

593
00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:56.439
> P10: The big

594
00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:57.990
> P10: check box.

595
00:53:58.410 --> 00:54:07.819
> P10: Those type of things seems to be really beneficial for him when I'm working with him to help him. There's a lot of stuff going on. Then he I can see him get overwhelmed.

596
00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:08.520
Tyler: Yeah.

597
00:54:08.753 --> 00:54:19.249
> P10: And I I know for me that I could probably get overwhelmed, too. And I and I'm going through a skim function right like you people, wanna again be efficient and and it and sometimes I don't like, do I really need to read that.

598
00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:20.120
Tyler: Hmm.

599
00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:23.930
> P10: I probably should need to read it, maybe like so there's the emphasis of

600
00:54:25.730 --> 00:54:32.169
> P10: big blocky, but not having like a lot of here here, and then the fine print where you don't read it. Yeah, the important stuff.

601
00:54:32.170 --> 00:54:45.930
Tyler: Right. No, that makes a lot of sense, I think. Like going back to like you, describing some of your like frustration with the like different [location] options is like a perfect example of why research is helpful, because

602
00:54:45.980 --> 00:55:11.689
Tyler: it's a little easy to be like the people sitting behind the computers like trying to build the website and being like, Oh, that's a little weird like. But I think it gives a lot of like color to like, why, that's important, that it's not confusing, because someone could end up at a hot the wrong hospital. And it could be this whole situation and and like you said, you wanna make sure you do the right like the right option, or, you know, do a good job. And and we obviously need to make sure that you can

603
00:55:12.029 --> 00:55:16.989
Tyler: and I think what you noted in terms of like going through each page and like

604
00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:21.114
Tyler: it, being simple and less, is more. Is really helpful.

605
00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:25.310
Tyler: we've really tried to like lean into that. This form used to be.

606
00:55:25.609 --> 00:55:51.300
Tyler: A lot of questions on one page. And then you'd go to the next page, and it'd be a lot of questions. So we've really tried to like break that apart. And I think that helps, despite some of the like roadblocks that we might have hit as a result of just the form itself. I think I could see how it was easy for you to think through a question. Choose an option, go to the next page, so that that's good to hear. Throughout the form. Did you feel like you? Like?

607
00:55:51.950 --> 00:55:55.170
Tyler: How did you feel about how long it took to complete the form.

608
00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:58.040
> P10: I think it was very

609
00:55:59.180 --> 00:56:00.850
> P10: time. Efficient. Okay.

610
00:56:00.850 --> 00:56:01.480
Tyler: Okay.

611
00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:05.480
> P10: You know, we're going through this study. So it's a little bit slower. You're talking.

612
00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:05.860
Tyler: Yeah.

613
00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:07.510
> P10: These pages, but

614
00:56:07.890 --> 00:56:14.229
> P10: that's that's the sweet spot of where I'd want to be, because then, if it wasn't for that study, I would have been able to go like here, there, there, and I'm done.

615
00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:15.010
Tyler: Have that.

616
00:56:15.170 --> 00:56:25.930
> P10: That question like I said I would either be able to get my snippet or my email, and then I would have that sense of like. At least I have something here, calendar and calendar event. Boom! And I I can move on.

617
00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:28.589
> P10: Until I would have to follow up.

618
00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:33.370
> P10: To the time relation of it. That was that was spot on, and actually really good.

619
00:56:33.370 --> 00:56:38.789
Tyler: Okay, that's good. Did you have a sense of how long it was? Gonna take like, while you were going through the form.

620
00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:59.389
> P10: No? Yeah. So there was. The other thing is like that. I didn't. The rhyme kind of like the rhyme or reason, or like the feeling of like, Hey, this is the questions that are going to be asked to even in the front end, like, you know, if there was something to say like this process may take, you know, generally takes one to 2 min to complete. That would be good.

621
00:57:00.010 --> 00:57:05.179
> P10: Because if it is one of those questionnaires that might take 45 min, I'm gonna block that time.

622
00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:09.160
> P10: You know my schedule to do it, but if it's only a 2 min task, then

623
00:57:09.250 --> 00:57:13.780
> P10: let's get through it anytime.

624
00:57:13.850 --> 00:57:21.799
> P10: That's something that I I would look for and have appreciated, with other things that I've done like, be prepared. This is going to take this, even if it's a simple

625
00:57:22.170 --> 00:57:26.330
> P10: Va. Requests like these requests in this form may take this much time.

626
00:57:26.639 --> 00:57:29.420
Tyler: Yeah. So even if it was just like a

627
00:57:29.970 --> 00:57:35.599
Tyler: sort of an estimate like this form might take you 10 min to complete at the beginning. That would be helpful for you.

628
00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:39.760
> P10: Something like we appreciate your inquiry. We look forward to assisting you.

629
00:57:40.152 --> 00:58:00.309
> P10: For your information. We see our our veterans typically take about 4 to 5 min to complete this process, or whatever it may be. That's always like, Okay, cool. I'm I'm good with this, and it also gives me a lot of like. Am I being the commander of the overthinking department? If they tell me that it's taken 4 to 5 min for most veterans, and I'm sitting in there for 30 min.

630
00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:01.690
> P10: Something.

631
00:58:02.030 --> 00:58:07.670
> P10: something that's weird here because I'm I'm skewing the numbers, because, I'm thinking, is it really the [location] number one?

632
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:08.090
Tyler: Phone number.

633
00:58:08.090 --> 00:58:08.490
> P10: Tube.

634
00:58:08.490 --> 00:58:09.160
Tyler: Yeah.

635
00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:09.660
> P10: Like somebody.

636
00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:10.200
Tyler: Yeah.

637
00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:12.110
> P10: Bend it and just hit the number one on it, and.

638
00:58:12.110 --> 00:58:12.950
Tyler: Right.

639
00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:13.919
> P10: Let it roll.

640
00:58:14.110 --> 00:58:14.820
Tyler: Yeah.

641
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.064
Tyler: yeah, that makes sense.

642
00:58:18.550 --> 00:58:36.150
Tyler: so it doesn't tell you at the beginning of the form how long it would be. But I can see why that would be useful, and other people have mentioned to it to us. One of the things that's a little complicated with this form is depending on certain answers that you give, the form might become longer or become shorter. So it's a little bit hard to say like

643
00:58:36.210 --> 00:58:57.722
Tyler: cause. It sometimes could be 5 min, and it actually sometimes could be like 15 min if you were submitting it. Maybe on behalf of like your wife. And it was getting your information and also your wife's information, for example. So but that's still really helpful feedback, because we keep hearing like we want to under. People want to understand how long the form will take them.

644
00:58:58.090 --> 00:59:04.039
Tyler: Did you notice at all? Anything that was showing your progress during the form.

645
00:59:04.270 --> 00:59:08.780
> P10: Yeah, at the top. It was you know, giving me a progress bar. I did.

646
00:59:09.390 --> 00:59:15.530
> P10: I saw it jump from like one to 22, and that made me go. Gosh! But that might have been like you said with the bug

647
00:59:15.966 --> 00:59:20.223
> P10: but the progress bar was something I did pay attention to

648
00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:24.859
> P10: because of the jumps. I kind of dismissed it, though.

649
00:59:25.010 --> 00:59:25.570
Tyler: Okay.

650
00:59:25.570 --> 00:59:32.289
> P10: I mean, I'll say that until I get to like I was like, Oh, well, it's like, it's saying I'm at 92, so I probably am almost done with this thing, or.

651
00:59:32.790 --> 00:59:33.590
Tyler: Yeah.

652
00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:38.220
> P10: fiber spores are always something that I appreciate.

653
00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:38.870
Tyler: Okay.

654
00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:39.850
Tyler: so.

655
00:59:39.850 --> 00:59:42.169
> P10: Like where you're at somehow to have like an indicator.

656
00:59:42.170 --> 00:59:46.959
Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. So it's helpful to kind of know how far along you are. But also

657
00:59:46.990 --> 00:59:51.839
Tyler: those big jumps made. You think that maybe something was like not working correctly.

658
00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:55.069
> P10: What I also didn't see is any type of, say, progress come back.

659
00:59:55.470 --> 00:59:55.925
Tyler: Hmm,

660
00:59:56.380 --> 01:00:01.920
> P10: Which would be certainly in like the longer ones, something I'd want to see.

661
01:00:02.730 --> 01:00:09.030
> P10: Like, save and continue or download form and and fill out later, or something like that.

662
01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:23.189
> P10: Back to that Samsung complaint. You know, if I lose connectivity, something weird happens, or or whatever. If I just spent 15 min and and explaining a situation or going through. And then it's like, Oh, sorry, Chrome crashed.

663
01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:25.080
> P10: I'm gonna be

664
01:00:25.290 --> 01:00:32.610
> P10: well, I'll deal with this next week, or it's just getting kicked down the road and leading towards the potential of like I just it won't.

665
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:34.320
> P10: I won't take care of it.

666
01:00:34.610 --> 01:00:37.169
Tyler: Yeah, yeah, that totally makes sense. Yeah.

667
01:00:37.170 --> 01:00:44.200
> P10: If there was, I don't know if there would be. But if there was a way to be able to save progress and return, then that's always going to be a helpful thing.

668
01:00:44.557 --> 01:00:47.769
Tyler: Have you noticed that before, on other Va forms.

669
01:00:51.400 --> 01:01:08.989
> P10: Not the Va if I can remember correctly, it's not. It hasn't. Social Security Administration has that. So? It's just like they can. Ssa. Does it? Where, if you're going through an application process, then it's a very lengthy process, and you can you can save that and then return.

670
01:01:09.674 --> 01:01:13.939
> P10: And they give you a code to like hop back in to return to it. So it's like authenticated.

671
01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:14.870
Tyler: Okay. Gotcha.

672
01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:22.680
> P10: But I can't recall any type of again. I've only been in a couple of situations, but I can't recall a save in the return option from Va. Gov.

673
01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:23.570
Tyler: Yeah.

674
01:01:24.130 --> 01:01:24.880
Tyler: cool.

675
01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:37.530
Tyler: The last thing I kind of wanted to ask about was, obviously, I, as far as I know, you didn't use speechify during that form. Is that something you would use during a form like that? Nope.

676
01:01:37.530 --> 01:01:45.890
> P10: It's because you do have it relatively boiled down to only like one line sentences it. It's not where I use it.

677
01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:54.829
> P10: speechify is something I use in a book or journal, or magazines, or things that I just have volumes of, you know. Text

678
01:01:56.210 --> 01:02:09.069
> P10: and I'll just throw it out there where, where it's not perfect is it has a hard time reading like copyright, and it'll go into say, like, if I'm reading a book, and then each page it'll have a vertical copyright thing on the side.

679
01:02:09.070 --> 01:02:10.070
Tyler: No meat.

680
01:02:10.070 --> 01:02:19.520
> P10: And then sometimes switch to this copyright thing and then read that, and then, what's really been bad recently, for it is because I'm in a physics class.

681
01:02:19.770 --> 01:02:24.480
> P10: The physics class has a lot of like the the scientific you know.

682
01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:33.100
> P10: manuals or scientific documents, and they're all over the map and the way that they're structured. And just the you know the writing so like you'd have

683
01:02:34.148 --> 01:02:38.279
> P10: a paragraph that's in this column. And then there's a paragraph in this column, and what's.

684
01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:38.640
Tyler: Features.

685
01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:48.540
> P10: Struggles with is like discerning which one is which. So it'll literally start to read one sentence and then read the sentences to the right of that which they're 2 different

686
01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:53.469
> P10: 2 different paragraphs and 2 different portions of the of the topic. So

687
01:02:53.570 --> 01:02:56.349
> P10: it's not perfect, and it does like jump around a little bit.

688
01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:59.578
> P10: and I know I jumped ahead, but I wouldn't.

689
01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:03.240
> P10: I wouldn't need speechify in in this instance.

690
01:03:04.843 --> 01:03:09.929
> P10: What I could see is the opposite of if it was a very long

691
01:03:11.965 --> 01:03:13.480
> P10: free, right component.

692
01:03:13.730 --> 01:03:28.028
> P10: and or like, if it was something like I wanted to convey a decent amount of a question in there, speech to text so like the microphone button that you see on something like, if like, if you have access to the microphone, individuals that struggle with typing

693
01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:34.730
> P10: or they just don't have the accessibility to type, too. Well, sometimes I do it, too, with my phone. Actually, I do a lot with my phone and.

694
01:03:35.488 --> 01:03:40.669
> P10: And Google Assistant, where I will. A music dictation essentially through Google Assistant

695
01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:42.240
> P10: and

696
01:03:43.270 --> 01:03:49.479
> P10: to take notes, as in in grammar, in grammarly evernote is the other one I use.

697
01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:50.160
Tyler: Okay.

698
01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:52.110
> P10: I don't know if you guys have heard of evernote.

699
01:03:52.110 --> 01:03:53.790
Tyler: Yeah, I remember, Evernote.

700
01:03:54.050 --> 01:04:00.380
> P10: Evernote is beneficial for me, but not, it's just. I'm able to compile and save and organize a whole bunch of different thoughts. It's.

701
01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:02.580
> P10: And notes. So.

702
01:04:05.450 --> 01:04:09.870
> P10: yeah, yeah, I wouldn't use speech. So I apologize.

703
01:04:09.870 --> 01:04:14.030
Tyler: No, that's okay. That's totally fine. I think it's really helpful for us to understand like

704
01:04:14.090 --> 01:04:41.160
Tyler: that. Someone like yourself who would find speechify useful in other contexts, doesn't feel the need to use it here. Like, that's still really helpful, and also to be honest like you also found some other like funny behavior that we hadn't seen before, which is really helpful. So just like an added bonus but yeah, I think you've answered all my questions. It's been really helpful. We ended a little bit early, so at least you get back a little bit of time. Do you have any other questions for me.

705
01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:42.069
> P10: I don't. No.

706
01:04:42.070 --> 01:04:49.810
Tyler: Okay, awesome. Well, I hope you keep doing research with the Va it's really helpful for us. So I I really appreciate your time.

707
01:04:50.150 --> 01:05:10.110
Tyler: and yeah, the next step. Since you haven't done this before. The folks who set up the research session perigee, and they're the other company that you looked up. They're gonna send you a thank you. Note and and they'll pass on some information in case you want to share it with other veterans who want to take part in research. And you can ask them any questions. If you have any great.

708
01:05:10.530 --> 01:05:11.280
> P10: She's been.

709
01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:13.380
Tyler: Thanks, [P10]. I hope you have a lovely rest of your day.

710
01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:15.500
> P10: Thanks you, you too, you take care!

711
01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:16.790
Tyler: Bye, bye.

712
01:05:16.790 --> 01:05:17.450
Evan: We're looking.
