### Warm up

Tyler: All right. So I just want to confirm. Are you comfortable? If I record my screen and audio today.

> P5: Yes, I have no problem with that.

3
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.980
Tyler: Okay. Awesome.

4
00:00:12.402 --> 00:00:17.469
Tyler: That was a lot of information. Do you have any questions at this point?

5
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.990
> P5: Not really.

6
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.680
Tyler: Okay.

7
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:30.579
Tyler: let's get started. Before we jump into testing the website. I'd love to just learn a little bit more about your background. How long have you been a veteran.

8
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:31.930
> P5: Hi!

9
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.529
> P5: I was paralyzed. 31 years ago

10
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.439
> P5: I spent 5 and a half years in the Air Force.

11
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.380
Tyler: Okay.

12
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.610
Tyler: Gotcha.

13
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:51.150
Tyler: And you kind of just started to mention this a couple of minutes ago. But how has it been for you trying to contact the Va either online or over the phone.

14
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.583
> P5: It's been fine up until

15
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.259
> P5: couple of weeks ago. They came down with a message that

16
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.960
> P5: my healthy back logging in with that

17
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.499
> P5: was going to change, and they had to do the

18
00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.840
> P5: login.gov, or whatever.

19
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.930
> P5: And trying to get on to. That was

20
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.609
> P5: was a nightmare

21
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.910
> P5: doing the trying to

22
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.200
> P5: verify my identity, or whatever.

23
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:22.250
> P5: I just everything I did. It wouldn't, except I ended up having to go to the post office yesterday and

24
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.180
> P5: do it that way. But that's

25
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.860
> P5: you know I'm a quadriplegic. It's not easy for me to get around so.

26
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.270
> P5: You know that was.

27
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.340
> P5: that was a pain in the butt, but I did finally get through it.

28
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:33.610
Tyler: Yeah.

29
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:52.349
Tyler: yeah, I'm sorry to hear that. To be honest with you, I've heard a lot of feedback that's pretty similar with people struggling to to do the online sort of version, or it just not accepting it for whatever reason. So and you managed to to get that sorted at the post office. Obviously it would be nice to avoid the trip, but.

30
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.909
> P5: Yeah, I got everything straightened out went to the post office once I got there. That was that was easy. Just

31
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.839
> P5: it was just very frustrating, trying to do it online. Rather. I didn't want to have to go to the post office, but

32
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.549
> P5: I did. So I got it straightened out anyway.

33
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.400
Tyler: Okay.

34
00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.041
Tyler: well, that's good in in the end, but obviously not a great experience.

35
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:20.079
Tyler: did you? Did you try and contact the Va at all. Or did you just sort of like notice? Okay, I guess I'll go into the post office.

36
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.268
> P5: I tried writing to

37
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.140
> P5: somebody at the@thelogin.gov or whatever, and they

38
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.619
> P5: huh! They sent back the exact same thing I said on the website.

39
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:40.439
> P5: if you're having trouble, you gotta go to the post office. But I just wrote to you to see if there was someone else, and you know you didn't have trouble. The same thing.

40
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.413
Tyler: Right? Yeah, yeah, for sure. That's really frustrating.

41
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.370
Tyler: how do you find it when you do contact the Va, do you usually like

42
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.650
Tyler: contact them over the phone? Or have you ever tried contacting them online?

43
00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:00.339
> P5: I do online most of the time I got on my healthy vet quite often. I've

44
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.569
> P5: have a lot of Va contacts in there, and that's always worked

45
00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.189
> P5: always worked great until they said they were changing in system, and

46
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.580
> P5: it got rather frustrating. But.

47
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:20.543
Tyler: Yeah, definitely, there's a lot of changes, especially with my healthy vet that veterans are kind of experiencing right now, which I know is a bummer, and hopefully, we'll

48
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.290
Tyler: like, settle

49
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.129
Tyler: a little bit in the future.

50
00:03:24.584 --> 00:03:29.440
Tyler: So you're are you contacting your doctors? Then like using secure messaging.

51
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.910
> P5: Yes, I will.

52
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.074
> P5: Right? That ends up going to

53
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.809
> P5: one of the nurses at the Va. Who

54
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.510
> P5: who gets the message to the doctor. But yeah.

55
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:39.400
> P5: okay.

56
00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.410
> P5: I I do my meds through the Va. A lot of them. I

57
00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:50.159
> P5: I correspond with the nurses there quite often. They probably probably get sick of sick of hearing from me.

58
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.879
Tyler: Well, that's good, so is secure messaging, generally working well for you. Then it sounds like.

59
00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:56.669
> P5: Yeah, so it's been.

60
00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:57.080
Tyler: Personal.

61
00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.129
> P5: Very well for me.

62
00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.749
Tyler: Okay, that's good.

63
00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:09.770
Tyler: what about if you're trying to contact the Va about something that's not related to healthcare? Do you know how, what you would do to contact the Va. In that case.

64
00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.880
> P5: Huh?

65
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.810
> P5: Usually. What I'll do is I end up writing to

66
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.220
> P5: the nurses there

67
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.979
> P5: in the Scidi sci office.

68
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.560
> P5: Whatever say, this is what my problem is.

69
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.929
> P5: would you forward this to the correct person.

70
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.400
> P5: and all I hear from that way.

71
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.640
Tyler: Okay.

72
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:36.820
Tyler: so obviously, you know, that that's like a way that you can get in touch with the va and they can kind of help you out more directly. That makes sense.

73
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:37.630
> P5: Right here.

74
00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.220
Tyler: Have you ever heard of something called? Ask Va.

75
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:42.130
> P5: I have.

76
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.830
> P5: I think I might have heard of, but I've never used it.

77
00:04:45.830 --> 00:05:05.820
Tyler: Okay, yeah, that's totally fine. So we're gonna be talking a little bit more about ask Va today. And it's really helpful to talk to people who use secure messaging because there's some sort of overlap with secure messaging. But it's also a little bit different. So you'll get a chance to see it and to go through that the website in a minute.

78
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:15.740
Tyler: before we move on. I just want to also learn a little bit more about how you're using your assistive technology. So how long have you been using dragon.

79
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.620
> P5: I 1st started using. It was

80
00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.870
> P5: back in the fall of

81
00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.560
> P5: 94.

82
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:24.140
Tyler: Okay.

83
00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:29.919
> P5: It was trying to dictate back. Then then it went to. Naturally speaking. Now, I think it's

84
00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.829
> P5: dragon, professional, individual, or something like that. I think.

85
00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:41.350
Tyler: okay, cool, that sounds like a lot of experience. And how often are you using it.

86
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:42.699
> P5: Oh, every day.

87
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.600
> P5: I use it for

88
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.489
> P5: waste 2, 3 h every day.

89
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:48.090
Tyler: Okay.

90
00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:52.150
Tyler: when you're not catching the sun rays that I I stole you from.

91
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.480
> P5: Yup! Yup! It's all you're.

92
00:05:54.286 --> 00:05:57.510
Tyler: And what what device are you using today?

93
00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:59.400
> P5: I'll

94
00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.469
> P5: what do you mean? The harmonic?

95
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.109
> P5: So I I the computer was windows 10

96
00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.429
> P5: using dragon professional.

97
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.260
> P5: I don't know what that.

98
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.920
Tyler: Yeah, that's.

99
00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.000
> P5: What you're looking for. Okay.

100
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.170
Tyler: Yeah. Yeah. So you're on like a windows desktop computer. Okay, cool.

101
00:06:18.216 --> 00:06:22.329
Tyler: I just want to check SK, did you have any other questions about tech setup before we move on.

103
00:06:27.015 --> 00:06:36.134
SK: No questions on my end. I actually don't have a dragon license. But if we do run into any issues with screen sharing. I'll try my best to assist.

105
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.050
> P5: Okay.

106
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:40.120
Tyler: Awesome.

107
00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.013
Tyler: all right.

108
00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:50.559
Tyler: which is a really good transition [P5]. The next thing we're going to do is, have you share your screen. On zoom. Have you done that before?

109
00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.040
> P5: Be honest, I don't think so.

110
00:06:54.280 --> 00:07:13.459
Tyler: Okay, that's okay. Let's see how it goes. So when you're on zoom like where you can see my face. There's gonna be some controls at the bottom of the screen. So like for mine, it says audio video. And in the middle there's something that says, share

111
00:07:13.758 --> 00:07:19.709
Tyler: so if you navigate to share, then it's going to open up a new window, and you're going to be able to see different

112
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:26.599
Tyler: windows on your computer? So why don't you go ahead and do that? And then let me know if you're facing any issue.

113
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:28.080
> P5: Microphone on

114
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:30.699
> P5: move mouse upper right

115
00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.370
> P5: faster.

116
00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:42.440
> P5: Move mouse right?

117
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:47.780
> P5: Much faster.

118
00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:58.510
> P5: much slower.

119
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:04.449
> P5: Mouse, quick

120
00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:11.850
> P5: microphone off.

121
00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:18.340
> P5: Okay, I probably gotta hit share with the bottom of this window. Then right.

122
00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:22.000
SK: Yeah, yeah, [P5], you just you can just say, click, share, screen.

123
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.390
SK: It should land on that

124
00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:25.490
SK: button.

125
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.080
> P5: We'll see microphone on

126
00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:32.309
> P5: microphone, on

127
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:35.480
> P5: click, share, screen.

128
00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:40.380
> P5: mouse 8,

129
00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:44.599
> P5: 8, 2, 8.

130
00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:48.250
> P5: Oh, it's quick!

131
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.330
Tyler: Okay, perfect.

132
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:56.840
> P5: Microphone off.

133
00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:05.060
Tyler: Awesome. So now I can see your screen. It says, Zoom, yup.

134
00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:23.369
Tyler: okay, perfect. So the next thing we're gonna do is we're gonna open up the test website. So I can either send that to you in the chat on Zoom, which means you'd have to go back to Zoom and then open it up from the chat. Or I can dictate the link to you. It's pretty short if that makes a difference.

135
00:09:24.615 --> 00:09:26.679
> P5: Probably your best bet would be to

136
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:29.190
> P5: dictate it to me.

137
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:29.880
Tyler: Okay.

138
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:30.600
> P5: I'm good.

139
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:34.570
Tyler: Am I going to tell you now, before you turn your mic on, or what's easier.

140
00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.440
> P5: Well tell me what it is.

141
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:43.140
Tyler: So it's bit.ly forward slash! Ask dash va.

145
00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:54.059
> P5: Yeah, I think we'll do it again in just a second microphone on

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:27.870
> P5: Is it gonna be a dash or an underscore.

164
00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:32.330
Tyler: It's a dash. So it's just dash. Yeah, it's a dash. And then Va.

165
00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:33.030
> P5: Going on.

166

168

169
00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:55.090
Tyler: Perfect.

170
00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:05.079
Tyler: Okay, awesome. So now we're all set up. I don't know if you want to turn your microphone off, or whatever you prefer.

171
00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.190
> P5: Microphone off.

172
00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:10.040
> P5: Okay.

173
00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:10.680
Tyler: Cool.

### Form

Tyler: That's perfect. So now we're all set up.

175
00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:26.700
Tyler: we're pretending like you've signed in. So this is kind of your account. And you're on va.gov I'm going to give you some context now, before we get into the actual going through the website. Okay.

176
00:12:27.431 --> 00:12:36.118
Tyler: so this is called, Ask Va, we started to talk about it a little bit earlier. It's a way for veterans to contact the Va online. If they have a question,

177
00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:41.600
Tyler: for today's session, we're basically going to pretend, like, you want to ask the Va a question online.

178
00:12:41.898 --> 00:12:51.820
Tyler: And I'm going to give you a scenario. So we're going to say that you, recently went went to a medical center and you have an you have an experience that you need to like. Ask a question about.

179
00:12:52.030 --> 00:13:01.379
Tyler: Obviously, from our conversation, I know you would probably just use secure messaging, which is totally fine. So just just for this scenario. Today, we'll pretend, like you're going to use this instead.

180
00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:02.070
> P5: Okay.

181
00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:05.990
Tyler: And I'll remind you of the scenario when we go, whenever whenever you need me to.

182
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:33.660
Tyler: as you're navigating we want to understand what's going through your mind. So if certain things are like not working as you're expecting, or you're like frustrated by like the way that you're having to navigate towards something feel free to let us know you can turn your microphone on and off whenever you whenever you want to. I'm mostly gonna try and stay quiet. Unless you know we're chatting just so you can kind of navigate on your own. And and I'm not interrupting.

183
00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:34.480
> P5: Okay.

184
00:13:34.705 --> 00:13:42.819
Tyler: One thing that can be helpful for me is if you pause every once in a while, and we and you can just kind of call things out and and we can talk about them.

185
00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:44.700
Tyler: Does does that all sound? Okay?

186
00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:46.729
> P5: Yeah, I think so.

187
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:49.053
Tyler: Okay, sounds good. So

188
00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:59.930
Tyler: Whenever you're ready, you can feel free to, you know. Start as if you're gonna ask the Va. Your question and I'll and I'll try and stay quiet on my end.

00:18:53.649 --> 00:18:57.280
Tyler: Yeah, that's a good question. So we can pause here for a minute.

239
00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:08.760
Tyler: this is kind of confusing, because we've said like for today what you're signed in. So if this was your phone number you know, we'll imagine that's your phone number and your email address.

240
00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:09.390
> P5: Okay.

241
00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:12.460
Tyler: So the reason that it's filled in is because you're signed in

242
00:19:12.889 --> 00:19:31.890
Tyler: so so if your phone number was in there and your email address was in there. I'm guessing you'd probably see it and go. Okay, cool. Continue on and so it wouldn't have been kind of like a question. So keep going just as you're going. And then I think at the end I'll have some questions for you. About the process.

243
00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:33.040

### Cool down

Tyler: Okay, awesome. That was very speedy and really interesting to just observe you move through the form before we. I mean, I think what you were gonna do next was, submit your question. Right? Yeah, okay, cool. So before we get there, I just wanted to chat a little bit about that experience, and also this page in particular.

Tyler: so 1st off like, how was that for you filling out that form.

> P5: kind of tedious. I don't know it. Just

> P5: there was an awful lot of steps to go through.

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:18.360
> P5: Had asked for my Zip code twice.

> P5: Seems like you could have would have been nice if we could have remembered that. But.

> P5: That's not a big deal.

> P5: I don't know. It just seemed like a lot of lot of steps go through, but

298
00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:30.597
> P5: I understand that.

299
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:32.930

00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:35.680

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.430
> P5: or asking questions, that

302
00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:40.960
> P5: it's gotta gotta go through somewhat.

303
00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:42.290
Tyler: Yeah.

304
00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:49.710
Tyler: but overall tedious, like more questions than you expected. And then you you noticed at 1 point you had to repeat yourself.

305
00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:51.510
> P5: Yes.

306
00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:52.180
Tyler: Yeah.

307
00:24:53.158 --> 00:24:58.859
Tyler: What about like the general behavior of the form along with using dragon?

308
00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:02.789
Tyler: Did you notice anything like unexpected? For example.

309
00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:04.869
> P5: No, everything seemed to work fine.

310
00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:08.169
> P5: I told you in the beginning I use

311
00:25:09.494 --> 00:25:15.860
> P5: dragon, professional, individual, or, naturally speaking, I also have other programs that I use

312
00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:17.540
> P5: that like

313
00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:18.960
> P5: to show. Why

314
00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:21.210
> P5: keep saying show flags.

315
00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:25.730
> P5: That's another program so called speech start plus.

316
00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:27.169
Tyler: Got it. Okay.

317
00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:32.589
> P5: And then like, when I said dB, and the dictation box showed up on the side

318
00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:36.540
> P5: that's from a program called Speech Productivity.

319
00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:37.730
Tyler: Okay.

320
00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:39.170
Tyler: that's how I.

321
00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:41.180
> P5: I have other programs besides.

322
00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:42.850
> P5: naturally speaking. But

323
00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:49.020
> P5: over the years I've I've accumulated others to make, you know, make it easier in general.

324
00:25:50.250 --> 00:26:00.359
Tyler: yeah, I could see that. I was gonna ask you like, how? What's going through your mind, how are you choosing, when to use, like the mouse grid versus the flags, or another way of navigating.

325
00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:05.670
> P5: Well, sometimes, like I'll say, show flags, and it won't work.

326
00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.470
> P5: Then I have to go to the mouse grid.

327
00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:10.839
> P5: I prefer to show flags, but

328
00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:13.239
> P5: sometimes it just won't work.

329
00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:20.659
> P5: and after I click on a button you probably noticed I went over the side and did a mouse click.

330
00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:20.980
Tyler: Yeah.

331
00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:22.389
> P5: There's lots of times

332
00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:25.550
> P5: I'll click on a button now aside, page down.

333
00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:27.430
> P5: It will

334
00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:30.279
> P5: go down to another button.

335
00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:34.830
> P5: If the buttons are still active, it'll go to a button or a button. So I just.

336
00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.570
> P5: I'm just in the habit of

337
00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:42.029
> P5: when I'm done with the button. I I make sure I get out of that area, and I page down.

338
00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:53.150
Tyler: Right? Yeah, I did notice that that makes sense. And then the dictation box is that just like it's better at picking up your speech, or like what's why do you then sometimes use that.

339
00:26:53.542 --> 00:26:55.899
> P5: Like the box that came up

340
00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:58.140
> P5: on the zoom website.

341
00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.666
> P5: probably isn't

342
00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:03.659
> P5: dragon professional friendly.

343
00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:07.170
> P5: The dictation box here. So I

344
00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:09.170
> P5: I dictate into that.

345
00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:11.610
> P5: and then I transfer it over there.

346
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:12.859
> P5: So it's like.

347
00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:15.219
> P5: I don't know. It's just hard to explain it. Just

348
00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:18.590
> P5: it's a lot more a lot more fun way than the

349
00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:20.650
> P5: just a regular box that came up.

350
00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:22.820
Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

351
00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:25.299
> P5: On just a second.

352
00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:26.289
Tyler: Yeah, of course.

353
00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:27.110
> P5: Carrie.

354
00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.619
> P5: take my hat off, boys.

355
00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:36.387
> P5: I want you to be able to see my whole gorgeous face here.

356
00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:38.780
Tyler: Well, your new Suntan, especially.

357
00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:45.510
> P5: I'm back.

358
00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:46.340
> P5: Okay.

359
00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:50.589
Tyler: I think I missed it. I think you missed it, I said especially because you've got a new suntan.

360
00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:59.190
Tyler: The new things. Okay, that makes sense. So you use different like forms of like different programs. Essentially, because.

361
00:27:59.190 --> 00:27:59.700
> P5: Yeah.

362
00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:00.970
Tyler: Figured out a good.

363
00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:04.200
> P5: Over the years I've acquired different

364
00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.100
> P5: different ones that

365
00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.129
> P5: work well for me.

366
00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:10.749
> P5: I highly recommend

367
00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:13.929
> P5: anybody that's disabled. Use their voice.

368
00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:16.841
> P5: take up the speech productivity.

369
00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:21.140
> P5: But that's just that's just me. So.

370
00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:23.420
Tyler: That's the one that has the dictation box.

371
00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:26.669
> P5: Yes, and there's all sorts of different stuff. There's

372
00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.500
> P5: there's a lot of different stuff you could use

373
00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:31.820
> P5: use with that. But.

374
00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:35.360
> P5: There are just a few of the options I I use.

375
00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:37.845
Tyler: That makes sense was the

376
00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:46.780
Tyler: like the flags you said that was from. I missed the name of the second tool you were using. But is is that something that, naturally speaking, wouldn't have.

377
00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:52.650
> P5: I believe, naturally speaking, has a version of it.

378
00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:55.560
> P5: but I couldn't get it to work at first, st

379
00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:59.230
> P5: and that this program came out, and I found it worked out so well

380
00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:02.139
> P5: I used I I prefer to use that.

381
00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:04.629
Tyler: Gotcha, that makes sense.

382
00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:10.160
Tyler: Yeah, I'm sure over the years, you've figured out like a really good formula for your for yourself, so that makes sense.

383
00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:12.750
> P5: I've been on it 31 years, so I've been.

384
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:14.000
> P5: I'm

385
00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:19.289
> P5: hit and miss on different programs. And I'm finally set up to pretty much what I like.

386
00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.140
Tyler: Yeah.

387
00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:45.860
Tyler: yeah, I mean, from my perspective watching go through the form like that was probably one of the quicker people we've seen go through the form and you kind of like knew, you know, that your question was about yourself, and that you're the veteran, and like you didn't have a lot of questions for me about what to fill out. So that's a good sign. I can also see how it was maybe longer than you would have expected, and you did have to like. Put your postcode in twice. So I get that as well.

388
00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:53.266
Tyler: When you got to this page, you. You kind of like page down, scroll down the whole page.

389
00:29:53.700 --> 00:30:00.649
Tyler: When you were ready to submit your question. Do you think that's usually what you would do on a page like this. You'd sort of just like skim it.

390
00:30:01.562 --> 00:30:03.310
> P5: To be honest.

391
00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:06.520
> P5: Yes, I was doing it, but not that fast.

392
00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:06.960
Tyler: Okay.

393
00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:09.180
> P5: I think I would pay more attention to it.

394
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:11.769
> P5: I think just that. I knew that

395
00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:13.960
> P5: all this isn't really, you know.

396
00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:16.530
> P5: and another thing, too.

397
00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:20.000
> P5: or whatever I just figured, I'll go to the bottom and.

398
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:20.700
Tyler: Yeah.

399
00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:27.570
Tyler: yeah, this is low stakes, considering, like, compared to you, submitting something on your own that make that makes sense.

400
00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:38.699
Tyler: did you have any questions about how this page worked, and if you want to, you can kind of scroll up if you want to have a refresh on on what was on this page.

401
00:30:40.208 --> 00:30:44.999
> P5: No, I don't think I have any questions. I mean, it's the typical

402
00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:47.979
> P5: type form I've seen lots of times.

403
00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:48.470
Tyler: Okay.

404
00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:53.230
> P5: You know. So I you know I'd say I had something different than other forms. I think I'm

405
00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:55.679
> P5: it was pretty self explanatory.

406
00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:56.350
Tyler: Yeah.

407
00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:59.870
Tyler: awesome. That makes sense. I mean, I think, overall that's

408
00:31:00.234 --> 00:31:14.009
Tyler: pretty good feedback, which it doesn't necessarily have to be good feedback. But I think it's good if it's if that felt familiar to you, and you kind of know what to expect. You understand that this page is for you reviewing your information. And then you're gonna submit your question.

409
00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:23.960
Tyler: it's up to you. You're welcome to keep this up on your screen now, or you can actually stop sharing your screen at this point if you like.

410
00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:31.349
> P5: i i i don't care. As long as everything's all right for you I'll stay here. They're not really sure how to get out.

411
00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:34.109
> P5: How I'd get out of the screen if I wanted to. So.

412
00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:39.370
Tyler: No, no worries. Yeah, there's not. It's not. Doesn't make a difference for me.

413
00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:40.820
Tyler: so

414
00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:52.198
Tyler: we're kind of coming to the end of like. I don't have any more questions specifically looking at the screen. But, I do want to ask some more questions, just to kind of follow up on particular things. I noticed.

415
00:31:52.970 --> 00:32:01.529
Tyler: one of the things in the form is explaining how far along you are in the form. Is that something that you noticed.

416
00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:04.570
> P5: I did notice it up there, but I didn't.

417
00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:06.759
> P5: I didn't pay much attention to it.

418
00:32:07.485 --> 00:32:08.210
Tyler: Yeah.

419
00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:10.000
> P5: It is nice to have that

420
00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:12.740
> P5: at times. I'm filling out forms. So I

421
00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:15.280
> P5: I have an idea that okay, well.

422
00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:17.520
> P5: you know, I have this far to go, or whatever.

423
00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:21.770
Tyler: okay, so you saw it. But you didn't pay close attention to it.

424
00:32:21.770 --> 00:32:22.320
> P5: Right, right.

425
00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:27.629
Tyler: You kind of understand, like what it's for and and why it might be useful and stuff like that. Okay.

426
00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:28.850
Tyler: okay, cool.

427
00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:40.189
Tyler: at this point so we haven't submitted the question, but imagining that we did submit your question, what would you expect to happen next?

428
00:32:45.370 --> 00:32:48.050
> P5: I would suspect that somebody would

429
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:51.360
> P5: right back to me. I'm

430
00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:54.600
> P5: I would think they would probably write back to me

431
00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:55.285
> P5: in

432
00:32:56.710 --> 00:33:00.069
> P5: the messenger that in my healthy vet or whatever

433
00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:02.620
> P5: that's what I think gonna happen. But

434
00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:06.449
> P5: maybe they've got, I think they have my email address. So.

435
00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:09.529
> P5: You know. Maybe it'll just be regular email, but

436
00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.479
> P5: I suspect it'll be through

437
00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:14.169
> P5: the messenger, or whatever they call it.

438
00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:15.040
Tyler: Yeah.

439
00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:17.679
Tyler: that makes sense. So it like.

440
00:33:18.325 --> 00:33:21.460
Tyler: you have ideas on how what might happen. But you're not.

441
00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:21.880
> P5: Got it.

442
00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:22.899
Tyler: Clear, on, on.

443
00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:23.220
> P5: Yeah.

444
00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:24.440
Tyler: Your message? Yeah.

445
00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:30.739
Tyler: And I think you chose when you were in the form. I think I remember you choosing that you prefer to be contacted by email, right?

446
00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:34.080
> P5: Yeah, yeah. It's a lot easier for me.

447
00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:36.346
Tyler: Yeah, yeah, I get that.

448
00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:44.549
Tyler: what? What do you think like having gone through this process? What do you think is the difference between this and secure messaging.

449
00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:55.320
> P5: Considering the way I usually do it. I just write to the nurse at the

450
00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:56.910
> P5: VA.

451
00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:00.170
> P5: I think there's a lot more complicated.

452
00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:03.570
> P5: but you know I'm cutting a lot of the middle man out.

453
00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:04.280
Tyler: Yeah.

454
00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:05.490
> P5: If I'm just

455
00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:10.400
> P5: I don't know it wasn't. It wasn't too bad that just there was a lot of steps, but

456
00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:12.270
> P5: they kind of made sense that

457
00:34:12.929 --> 00:34:17.330
> P5: as I go from one step to the other, it's gotta they've got to narrow it down to

458
00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:20.300
> P5: sending the message to the correct person. So.

459
00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:26.660
Tyler: Yeah, for sure. So I mean, I think if you think about once you've signed in

460
00:34:28.090 --> 00:34:33.730
Tyler: both of these processes are fairly different to one another. It's just the similarity as you're contacting somebody.

461
00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:44.620
Tyler: this is so. I'm kind of going off script at this point, because we sort of finished all my questions. But this is kind of one of the things that's a little confusing about ask. Va. Is that

462
00:34:45.713 --> 00:34:52.390
Tyler: for questions like for medical questions. It would be better to go to secure messaging, and actually talk directly to your doctor

463
00:34:52.420 --> 00:35:15.290
Tyler: and this this tool that we just use would would be better for things like you know, you have like a general question about like, if you can receive disability, compensation, or or things like that do you think that distinction is clear, like, just based on your experience using it, you would kind of know. Oh, maybe I would use this for something else, or.

464
00:35:16.450 --> 00:35:18.859
> P5: Oh, boy, you're you're on

465
00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:20.810
> P5: a million dollar question here.

466
00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:26.069
> P5: if I had lots of extra time

467
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:28.889
> P5: I would use this, I guess.

468
00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:31.700
> P5: for something, you know, nonpertinent. That wasn't.

469
00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:34.170
> P5: That wasn't reorated to the doctor.

470
00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:36.830
> P5: I'd probably use something like use this, but.

471
00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:37.430
Tyler: Yeah.

472
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:39.000
> P5: I'm just so used to the

473
00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:42.359
> P5: it's the instant messenger, or whatever that

474
00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:45.010
> P5: I would most likely just write to that, anyway.

475
00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:53.150
> P5: cause I have. I can write to the social worker and all the different people through with the instant messenger. So

476
00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:54.520
> P5: Hi

477
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:57.080
> P5: would most likely go to that first.st

478
00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:57.780
Tyler: Yeah.

479
00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:01.739
> P5: I think it's a lot easier. Just go in there. Click on the, you know, Link, and

480
00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:03.739
> P5: and send my message, and

481
00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:08.640
> P5: if they can't answer it, they'll send it. They'll tell me where I can get the answer.

482
00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:09.380
Tyler: Right.

483
00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:17.229
Tyler: and it's easier. I I think this is probably very obvious. But just to confirm, it's easier because you don't have to go through like a series of questions.

484
00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:19.190
> P5: Right. I don't have to go through.

485
00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:22.099
> P5: I don't wanna have to go through a half dozen pages

486
00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:25.540
> P5: to finally get my question submitted.

487
00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:29.850
> P5: or I could just go in there, click on, you know, respiratory or

488
00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:31.470
> P5: or how to

489
00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:34.960
> P5: the social work or whatever, and

490
00:36:35.290 --> 00:36:37.720
> P5: I just find that a lot faster and easier.

491
00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:38.430
Tyler: Yeah.

492
00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:43.598
Tyler: yeah, that makes sense, I think. I think it's hard to argue with that.

493
00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:49.000
Tyler: do you have any questions for me at this point about ask BA, or this research.

494
00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:54.200
> P5: No, I I think I'm pretty good with it.

495
00:36:54.200 --> 00:37:11.030
Tyler: Okay, awesome. Well, I think you've answered all of our questions. So I really appreciate it. You were very, very speedy. Which bodes well for you and your your sunshine time today. And we really appreciate you coming in and joining us.

496
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:12.879
> P5: So we're done already. Huh?

497
00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:14.339
Tyler: Yeah, we were quick.

498
00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:14.870
> P5: Wow!

499
00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:17.719
> P5: We did it half the time.

500
00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:24.010
Tyler: We did. We did half the time. It's cause we both talked about sunshine for 10 min before we started, like.

501
00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:24.800
> P5: Yeah, yeah.

502
00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:33.300
Tyler: We had something else on our minds. No, you were just really quick, and it was it was very efficient and kind of easy to watch you go through the form, so I made it. That made it fast.

503
00:37:34.090 --> 00:37:35.940
> P5: Well, thank you. If I can

504
00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:39.500
> P5: do anything for you in the future, feel free to get a hold of me.

505
00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:55.549
Tyler: Yeah, thanks so much. Yeah, it. We really appreciate you. Joining studies like this. A lot of people at the Va are interested in doing research, especially with people who are using technology like you, that are navigating in different ways. So it's it's really, really helpful.

506
00:37:55.795 --> 00:38:11.009
Tyler: And if you want to participate in the future, the folks who set up this research session they'll. They'll get in touch with you when we finish and send you a thank you. Note, so you can reach out to them. If you have any, follow up questions, but hopefully we'll see you back here for a session in the future.

507
00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:14.559
> P5: Yeah, that'd be good, thank you. And anything I can do to help

508
00:38:14.830 --> 00:38:17.040
> P5: the Va. Does a lot for me. So I

509
00:38:17.050 --> 00:38:19.720
> P5: I don't mind doing stuff like this to help them out.

510
00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:25.199
Tyler: Well, we really appreciate it, and hopefully it'll make it a little easier for you to use some of the things that

511
00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:27.826
Tyler: the Va. Makes as well.

512
00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:30.179
> P5: Alright! Well, have a good day.

513
00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:31.620
Tyler: You too, [P5]. Bye.

514
00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:32.429
> P5: And bye

515
00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:34.269
> P5: microphone on.
