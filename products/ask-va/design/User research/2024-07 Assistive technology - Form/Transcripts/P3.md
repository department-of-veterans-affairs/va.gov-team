### Warm up

Thomas: Okay, I've started the recording, and I'd like to confirm again, are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talked today.

> P3: Sure.

Thomas: Okay. So it seems like, we're ready to begin here. So 1st just have a few warm up questions. I'm curious. How long have you been in? How long have you been a veteran.

> P3: Since 1,999

> P3: I got out of the army in that year.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: And during this time, have you ever contacted the VA online or over the phone.

> P3: Sure all the time.

Thomas: Okay, can you tell me about a time when you contacted the Va. And maybe like, How do you usually contact them?

> P3: Well, now, I use the VA.gov app.

> P3: Okay.

> P3: but before you used to have to call the 1-800 number.

> P3: Alright.

Thomas: And based upon your interaction with VA. How was the support that you received.

> P3: Well before, when you used to have to call, it was hard because you had to wait because other veterans were calling, and so there was always a queue. But now, if you go on you know, go online to check your stuff. It's fast.

> P3: You could get all your information in one shot. But at the same time, if you need to call the 1 800 number now. It's really fast, they answer, because everybody has the app.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: Well, it's great that you. You have a great experience, especially with the application.

Thomas: Let me ask you this. Have you ever heard of? Ask Va.

> P3: The yeah, there's a little tab up there, and you can ask the question or type in like an inquiry, and then it tries to like give you answers.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: So it would that be more of like, I, I haven't used the app before. Is that kind of like a chat Bot, or an FAQ.

> P3: It's more like when, from what I remember the last time I use it was maybe like a month ago, and I think I asked something about a reading, but it gave me just examples of stuff within the website. I believe that's what it did. Okay, all right.

Thomas: So this is gonna be a little bit different than that and so with, with regards to the assistive technology tool that you talked to me a little bit about. How long have you been using that that tool?

> P3: Probably for about say, about a year and a half.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: And how often do you use this? Is it for just Ask VA.

> P3: If I go if I go online, or you know, even like Facebook and stuff like that, like I, I have to use it sometimes. Okay, alright.

Thomas: And again, this is an android device. Is that correct?

> P3: Yeah. Okay. Great.

Thomas: When do you use this also for the application? Then, that you that applications on the phone.

> P3: Are you talking about as far as the VA app? Yeah.

> P3: Well, for the most part it's pretty legible at the letters are big on my screen.

> P3: but I'm not. I'm not sure.

> P3: Oh, you know, maybe, what on the like where you have the sub stuff a couple of times. I've opened it up, just to, you know. Kind of make sure that I'm reading the correct thing, and then, if I open a Pdf I usually use their own, their little plus and minus, to read my stuff.

Thomas: Okay.

> P3: But sometimes I use the magnification screen.

Thomas: Okay?

Thomas: So with this study that we're doing today, the research that we're doing is not within the ask, Va application. It's gonna be on online. So again, this isn't

Thomas: currently on, ask va.com or AsK VA.gov, but where we're going to be pointing to today is is within a browser. 1st off. Have you ever shared your screen while using zoom and using this particular tool.

> P3: Yeah. The last time I did a survey like this I shared my screen.

Thomas: Okay, great so what I'm gonna have you do now is start sharing your screen.

Thomas: Okay?

> P3: Trying to remember how I did it last time.

> P3: There we go.

Thomas: Perfect.

Thomas: So the next thing we're gonna do is I'm gonna share a link with you to the staging website. And do you prefer that. Could I just send that as a link in the Zoom chat? Or do you want me to dictate the URL to you?

> P3: Oh, probably a link in the chat. What.

Thomas: Okay, great, we'll do that.

Thomas: Okay. So I'm going to place

Thomas: a link in the chat should be there now.

> P3: Trying to figure out how I get back to the chat.

> P3: Let's say I'm trying to

> P3: see how I get back to that.

Thomas: Okay.

> P3: Maybe. Yeah, maybe you should just dictate it to me.

Thomas: Okay? And you can open up any browser that you're used to using

Thomas: perfect.

Thomas: Okay? So up in the search bar

Thomas: or up in the URL bar up at the top you're gonna type in the word, BIT.

> P3: BIT.

Thomas: Period.

> P3: Period.

Thomas: LY.

> P3: Oh, one huh!

Thomas: And then the forward slash!

> P3: Yep.

Thomas: And then ask the word, ask.

> P3: Okay.

Thomas: And then a dash.

Thomas: And then the let 2 letters VA.

Thomas: Yeah, that should be. It might have to put it up in that URL Bar potentially.

> P3: Oh, okay, I'm in. I mean.

Thomas: May not do a search.

Thomas: There you go!

> P3: And so brought up the same thing.

Thomas: See. Let me try that copy and paste again into that. Yeah, URL.

> P3: Oh! Is it this one.

Thomas: No, it's not that one cause. This one is very specific. It's not within the the Va dot gov, so we'll have to like, do that specific.

Thomas: Yeah, URL, see if that place can work again.

Thomas: Hmm.

> P3: Let me try this, then.

Sara Smith: It looks like it's copying and pasting it as a Google search. If you look under.

Thomas: Oh, okay.

> P3: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay, so.

Sara Smith: So you might. You might have just to retype it.

Thomas: Yeah. So I'll try that again.

> P3: Being.

> P3: meaning.

Thomas: Perfect right there. See if that

Thomas: does it.

> P3: No, I think I think I have to retype the whole thing.

Thomas: Okay.

> P3: Okay.

> P3: T

> P3: gone

> P3: LY.

Thomas: Yeah. Forward. Slash!

> P3: Flash!

> P3: Ask!

> P3: Oh, no!

Thomas: And yeah, nothing. Yeah. There you go. Ask.

> P3: Ask.

Thomas: Dash.

> P3: Gosh!

Thomas: VA.

> P3: Yeah, yeah.

Thomas: Yay, all right.

Thomas: perfect.

### Form

Thomas: Okay, so just a little bit of background on this.

Thomas: So today, we're just gonna observe as you navigate through this particular flow, this scenario before you start, I'm gonna just share a little context with you.

Thomas: So again, this tool as VA.

Thomas: For veterans to contact the Va ask a question online. So for today's session, and I can repeat this as we go through it, we're going to pretend, like you're going to ask

Thomas: the Va. A question about a recent experience that you had at a medical center.

Thomas: Okay?

Thomas: And again, I can remind you of the scenario whenever you need to. Just let me know. So a a recent experience that you had at a Va Medical Center. And as you navigate, we want to understand what's kind of going through your mind, how you're using the assistive technology, how it's supporting you. And when you start the form I'm gonna just try to stay as quiet as possible, so you can focus in on the task.

Thomas: And so for. Now, what we're gonna do is I'm gonna have you kind of so going back on that very 1st page. So you you're already blazing through it. So

Thomas: going back right here, as you kind of look at this, you kind of like, basically understood where you needed to start. I take it.

> P3: Right cause. You ask a new question.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: Is there anything else here that as as you see it, that

Thomas: you'd want to know more information about, or need

Thomas: need any further clarification on.

> P3: No.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: So again, here you began by doing which action.

> P3: Asked a new question.

Thomas: Okay. Now on this page, just as you kind of read through this, what are we seeing here?

> P3: Your personal information pops up.

> P3: If I'm assuming, if you've already signed in.

Thomas: So today we're pretending that you're Jason Todd.

Thomas: right? Right?

Thomas: So in this particular instance, you're seeing a little bit of information

Thomas: and anything else on this page that that jumps out at you.

> P3: Just

> P3: that. You can't update your personal information.

> P3: On this, you have to call the number. And

> P3: let's see.

> P3: you can ask. You can ask questions about benefits and services.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: right? If you're ready to. Whenever you're ready to continue, you can go ahead.

> P3: Alright!

Thomas: And what do you see on this page.

> P3: It's asking for the categories. So it's got a drop down, menu.

> P3: and they're predetermined categories.

> P3: And then you choose. You choose from one so mine would be about.

> P3: I'm assuming it would be under health care. Let me see.

> P3: cause it's about a recent experience I had.

Thomas: Yep. At the Va. Medical Center.

> P3: Yeah.

> P3: so then.

Thomas: If it wasn't healthcare. Is there something else that would make more sense in terms of a category.

> P3: Yeah.

> P3: it just a tab that said recent experience.

Thomas: Okay. Yeah.

> P3: Because

> P3: I mean, I I understand that

> P3: maybe they don't want to be negative or have a negative tab there. But

> P3: maybe it would open up a whole can of worms for veterans that have to say something else. But

> P3: I would. Yeah, I mean, it would just be easier because I don't know if I'm supposed to put healthcare, or

> P3: you know.

Thomas: Right?

Thomas: That's a, that's a great point. So for now, since the other option isn't there of the recent experience, we'll go ahead and select healthcare.

> P3: Right. I I would have done that just because I that's what I would have thought about. But maybe somebody else wouldn't be.

> P3: Let's see.

Thomas: Yeah.

> P3: Hmm.

> P3: okay, life insurance benefits

> P3: mention

> P3: sign in and technical issues.

> P3: Okay. So I went there. Just wanna make sure. I guess it didn't go back. Hold on! Let me see.

> P3: Yes, for healthcare. Alright! Continue

> P3: alright.

Thomas: Alright! What are we seeing on this page?

> P3: Hold on a second.

> P3: Alright. Select the topic.

> P3: Well again.

> P3: I mean. I guess if it was getting care. I'm not sure if that's what it is.

> P3: But if it was a but it was, if it was getting care

> P3: I'm I mean I would have probably chose that just because that would have been my thought process. But again. I would have still had, you know, something different.

> P3: just a 1 option, because getting care could just be a question about how could I get care. you know, but if I have an issue with the care I was given. or there was just a difficulty, then that's not really present here.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: So while getting care, a local Va medical center would be one potential option that you would select from different wording would probably be something that you'd be looking for.

> P3: Oh, you're asking me what wording.

Thomas: Yeah. Sorry.

> P3: I would say. Tell us about a recent experience.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: okay.

Thomas: So for now, what would be the most or what would be the choice that you would select out of these topics right now.

> P3: I would have getting care, I guess.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: so go ahead. And yeah, go ahead.

> P3: Have to have it be about myself.

Thomas: Right.

> P3: I'm a veteran.

Thomas: Okay.

> P3: Alright. Use my location.

> P3: Oh, I guess

> P3: my phone stops that, or whatever.

Thomas: Okay.

> P3: Okay.

Thomas: So that was interesting. You had you just entered your Zip code and clicked on search. Is that correct?

> P3: Yeah.

Thomas: Okay. For some odd reason it jumped to this page.

Thomas: And

Thomas: that was not necessarily the flow that we were looking for here on that one and that was one of the things that I I think I had found when I was trying to test this earlier, and I couldn't replicate it. Could you do something for me for just a moment and click, click on the back button.

> P3: Okay.

> P3: Understood.

Thomas: I'm sorry. Yeah, so, yeah.

> P3: Alright!

Thomas: And if you could try filling in that postal code again.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: hmm.

Thomas: So one of the things that's supposed to show up just to let you know. Donna.

> P3: Is the nearest Va. Hospital.

Thomas: Right. The nearest Va. Hospital should come up for where you would select that.

> P3: That's what I was expecting, because I figured if they already had my if they already had my information like, why would I have to put it in again.

Thomas: Right? Okay? So that's that, that will be something that we'll note to making sure that we check for some odd reason that did not do what it was supposed to. There. Alright. So at that moment. After you would select the health care that you would want information about or ask about.

Thomas: So going into this page here, what are we seeing.
[P3]
> P3: Well, they're asking,

> P3: just phone number, maybe to up, maybe to. I think this page should have been like, if they already have your stuff, just asking you if you want to change anything.

Thomas: Hmm.

> P3: And this preferred name. And then the pronouns, I mean, that's that's all self-explanatory.

Thomas: Okay.

> P3: But I would be like this is the contact information we have for you. Would you like to make any changes now.

Thomas: Okay.

> P3: Oh, do I need to select something alright?

Thomas: [P3], one of the things that might have happened on that previous page that I just wanted to test one more time.

> P3: Sure.

Thomas: If we can. Yeah, go back one more. And then, yeah, so try on on that zip code

Thomas: before go ahead and enter into the number. And then, before you do anything

Thomas: which button I wanted to make sure what? Which button that we're pressing.

> P3: It should have done the search!

Thomas: Okay. So I'd

Thomas: didn't see that you'd press continue. And they were wondering if maybe Continue was pressed. Okay.

> P3: Okay. So

> P3: oh, no, wait. That's not the one

> P3: that's the one.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: Great.

> P3: There we go!

Thomas: Perfect.

> P3: Okay.

Thomas: So the great thing is here. It's already kept your information, and also what you had already selected.

> P3: Okay.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: okay.

Thomas: what is this page asking for.

> P3: For food.

> P3: It is

> P3: 9.

> P3: Answer a question.

Thomas: Now, in this particular instance, you can type in whatever you want. We don't have any specific

Thomas: thing that you need to type in here.

> P3: Okay. So I got, I, I have a question.

Thomas: Sure.

> P3: So

> P3: if I

> P3: if it's about an experience that I have, I'm assuming that it

> P3: was either a positive or a negative experience.

Thomas: Okay.

> P3: So if I had a negative experience, what type of question would I be asking about a negative experience.

Thomas: That's true.

> P3: I mean, I I would think that it should have changed with my selection of

> P3: when when it asks

> P3: tell us about a recent experience, or whatever.

> P3: That it should say something to the probably effect of write your comment below, or or you know something like that, because I mean, what? What question am I am I going to ask? So if I had a negative experience or something happened there?

> P3: The only thing I can ask would be.

> P3: why did my doctor not see me on time?

Thomas: Yeah.

> P3: You know something like that.

> P3: So I think maybe that would would be it should it should change with your, you know.

Thomas: Right, based upon the type of things you've provided earlier. Yeah.

> P3: Right, because, like even me. I mean, I want to say that I'm fairly intelligent, and I can decipher or make a comment. Anyway, somebody might not be.

> P3: you know, might not get that.

Thomas: Right right

Thomas: now. That's a really good point.

> P3: So let's let's say oops!

> P3: Yes.

> P3: alright.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: okay.

Thomas: So on this page before we oh, that's right. I'm sorry. That's perfectly fine. As you kind of

Thomas: look through this page, and one of the things that I just want to let you know that we're still cleaning up the design on this particular page. Just, you know, as you're kind of looking through this, I'd like to

Thomas: get your thoughts about what you're seeing here, and what you can do, or what maybe what you can't do.

> P3: Basically, what I'm seeing is that

> P3: that I they're verifying that the question that I asked is correct, and the topic that I selected. and that it's me I'm asking about.

> P3: My information. I guess it's just trying to verify that everything's correct. And the one thing that I can do.

> P3: or a couple of things I can do is change my question about getting

> P3: here at a local Va center.

> P3: But I can't change the topic.

> P3: and then I can edit my contact information

> P3: and my postal code.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: okay, is, is that kind of about what you'd expect, or, you know, based upon some of this

Thomas: or is there anything else that you would expect that you could do on this page.

> P3: Yeah, I'd expect one more thing.

Thomas: Okay.

> P3: I'd expect to be able to just start over.

Thomas: Start over, okay.

> P3: You know where the collapse all is.

> P3: Like, maybe there should be something else that says

> P3: start over.

Thomas: Okay.

> P3: Just in case I mean cause if you see something and you go, you know what? That's not the

> P3: that's not the topic I wanted to choose. Then you have to start

> P3: going the back button back button back button.

> P3: you know. It's just easier just to.

> P3: you know. Start over.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: that that makes a lot of sense. So does that expand and collapse all help?

Thomas: Or is that just okay? Okay.

> P3: Yeah.

> P3: Cause then you can just verify it, collapse it, and then submit your question.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: so on this page right here, what information is it telling you.

> P3: The confirmation number of the question I asked

> P3: here.

> P3: And then.

> P3: they're gonna send me a

> P3: an email confirmation of that.

> P3: You should receive a reply by phone call within 7 business days

> P3: if we need more information.

> P3: Now.

> P3: yeah, you know.

> P3: I think maybe I didn't

> P3: see text on their sometimes you can't answer the phone.

Thomas: Okay.

> P3: You know, and then you lose.

Thomas: Right.

> P3: I don't. I don't know if they're gonna call you back again.

Thomas: Okay.

> P3: But I think maybe it would. There should be a text option. I mean, it's, you know, emails, people don't really go into their emails unless they need to like me. I get tons of emails on my phone. So I don't always look at them.

Thomas: Right.

> P3: But if somebody sends me a text, it pops up right away, and then I know I've got, you know, an answer.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: One of the things that I'd like to try going back just one page going back to that confirm and edit page for a moment.

Thomas: and you might need to hit, maybe, if you even hit your back button on your browser.

> P3: Or.

Thomas: On this particular page. Let's say, if you needed to edit either your phone number or your postal code and seeing how that looks.

Thomas: And let's just if you wanted to type in a completely random phone number or.

> P3: Or.

Thomas: was it? 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 digits long. Something like that. Yeah.

Thomas: so did that update it.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: yeah. Okay.

Thomas: And what's interesting is is that I think

Thomas: for some reason, it's telling you that you updated your postal code even though you updated your phone number. So.

> P3: Yeah. Okay. Alright.

Thomas: Alright.

Thomas: Alright. So going you can go back to the submit the question. And once you were once you landed on this particular page. What would be your next step?

> P3: To wait.

> P3: Yes.

Thomas: Okay.

> P3: Well, there's a feedback there. I'm not sure what that is, but

> P3: I mean.

### Cool down

> P3: I know it's kind of frustrating

> P3: because

> P3: if you gonna ask a question, and then wait 7 days to get an answer.

> P3: You know that's kind of pretty rough.

Thomas: Okay.

> P3: But I guess you can call the 1 887 1,000 number if you right there, if you need help.

Thomas: Okay.

> P3: You know.

> P3: I mean, maybe it would have been better

> P3: to have a chat button, but I don't know if the Va. Does that at all. So.

Thomas: Like a live chat.

> P3: Sure.

Thomas: Okay.

> P3: Either that or even a bot that can answer basic questions.

Thomas: Okay.

> P3: Cause, you know, you might have a like that question I asked was basic, you know, how long does it take to get my medication. If in the mail, let's say, Yeah, and there could be an easy answer that it usually takes between 7 to 10 days to get it in the mail.

> P3: or if you wait at the pharmacy counter, it could be anywhere from 15 min to an hour.

Thomas: Okay, yeah.

Thomas: So maybe even something. Even before you asked this question, you you started to to do the ask when you 1st landed here, and you hit the button. Ask a ask Va. A question you might be looking for either like a an FAQ or a chat bot rather.

> P3: I was about to say, maybe a frequently asked question.

Thomas: Okay.

> P3: Thing, and then, you know, cause me, I'm a frequent. I go to the frequently asked questions 1st that way. I don't have to go through this whole thing.

> P3: And there may be a quick answer, instead of going through a whole submit, unless I have something specific.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: no, that makes sense.

Thomas: Was there anything going through this form?

Thomas: Did you always feel like you knew like

Thomas: where you were at. Was there anything

Thomas: that was challenging or go ahead. Yep.

> P3: One time, just the time where I needed to pull down from the drop menu and

> P3: what I wanted wasn't there. So I had to choose the next best thing.

Thomas: Okay. Alright.

Thomas: Is there anything else that you felt that you would change about the experience? I you you talked about the question. And that label, and with regards to the the pull down menu, is there anything else that you would change about the experience.

> P3: No, it was pretty straightforward.

Thomas: Alright.

Thomas: Let's see just trying to see if there was anybody else that was on our team that had questions that we needed to kind of go through. Was there anything in terms of this process you found helpful? or that you that you enjoyed about it?

> P3: It was simplified.

> P3: I mean

> P3: simple is good like in the army, they say. Keep it simple, stupid.

> P3: And that's it's it's a pretty simplified process, I mean, just with the exception, like I said, of the dropdown menu that didn't have what I was looking for. But

> P3: I mean other than that. It's clean and it's simple. And I got through it right away. I knew exactly where to go.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: when you, when you were talking about the simplicity of this as you

Thomas: progress through each page, did you notice something? In terms of a progress bar that as you were kind of going through the form, yeah.

Thomas: did you find that helpful at all?

> P3: Sure, because then, you know how much longer it's gonna take for you. I'm 1 of those people, too. I'm 1 of those time management people. So

> P3: I I wanna know how long it's gonna take me if it's gonna if I'm barely 10

> P3: 10% into this whole thing. And I've already gone through 6 pages. I'm like, Oh, forget this, I'm not doing it.

Thomas: I I there's a lot of people that express that same sentence sentiment. So I completely understand it.

Thomas: Is there anything else that you would like to give feedback or or let us know before we close up today, we we you blew through this form really fast, which was, which is amazing. We have, like 10 min left.

Thomas: How did you? In terms of like, even like looking at the text you had mentioned using the application for the Va.

> P3: Sure.

Thomas: That you don't really have to zoom in. How did you find this in terms of using this with the magnification tool that you use.

> P3: It was. Actually, it was actually not too bad. I mean, I zoom in a little bit like if I'm gonna read this stuff right here.

Thomas: Okay.

> P3: You know, just a little bit either that or I'll have to pull the phone way back from my face. But I mean, as far as everything else. I mean, it's actually pretty simple, especially because it's black and white.

Thomas: Yes.

> P3: And so the black and white is really good, because once you start getting into like colors and stuff like that, it's then it becomes harder to focus on. Okay.

Thomas: Oh, that makes sense. Okay.

> P3: And that's that's pretty much it. I mean, it was pretty easy.

Thomas: Well, you you do this very smoothly in using this screen magnification and and looking at everything. [P3], you like, I said.

Thomas: All of the feedback that you've provided us today was super helpful. And I don't see any other questions right now from my team.

Thomas: And we can. We can end this early. If you want, you can stop sharing your screen at this moment.

Thomas: Okay, yeah.

> P3: Let's here.

> P3: I forgot how to do that.

> P3: I think I got it.

Thomas: Perfect.

Thomas: Yeah.

> P3: Alright!

Thomas: Perfect. Well, again, we really appreciate your time today. And I hope you have a great rest of the afternoon. And so we'll we can end the session early and give you some time back this afternoon.

> P3: Alright! Thanks.

Thomas: All right, [P3]. Thank you so much.

> P3: Alright! Alright! See you.

> P3: Right. Thank you.
