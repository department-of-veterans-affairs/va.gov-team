### Warm up

Thomas: Okay, we started recording. And I'd like to confirm again that, are you comfortable, [P7]? If I record my screen and record the audio as we talk today.

> P7: Yes, I'm comfortable with that.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: okay, so before we get started, I'd like to learn a little bit about your experience with the Va and the online services with the Va. I'm curious. How long have you been a veteran?

> P7: That in the system, or

> P7: how long I do you mean? How long ago did I get out of the service.

Thomas: Yes, please. Yeah, yeah. That'd be fine.

> P7: I got out in 75.

Thomas: Right?

Thomas: And have you ever contacted the Va say, like online or over the phone.

> P7: Yes.

Thomas: And what is your most

Thomas: common method of contacting the Va.

> P7: I usually go online.

Thomas: Okay. Alright.

Thomas: Can you tell me about a time where you contacted the Va. And a little bit about that experience.

> P7: Well, the main problem

> P7: online is 

> P7: is good.

> P7: Calling is another story.

Thomas: We heard.

> P7: yeah, I mean, by the time you pick up the phone and somebody answers.

> P7: it takes a while to go through all the prompts.

> P7: I've even been connected to wrong departments

> P7: and then had to start all over again.

> P7: But the online method is works the best.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: do you have any applications? Or is there a certain service online with the Va that you use most often.

> P7: I use it mostly to speak with my

> P7: primary care.

> P7: position.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: Have you ever heard of? Ask Va before?

> P7: I have heard of it.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: one of the things that we're working on right now. Ask, Va is not currently just under like, va.gov, it's kind of like its own subdomain right now. So this is one of the things that we're working on. Have you ever used? Ask Va. Before in the past.

> P7: Now.

Thomas: Okay,

Thomas: one of the things here that we're working on to improve is making sure that the site works well for everybody, especially for those that use assistive devices. And can I ask, how long have you been using the pointer tool that you use to navigate the web.

> P7: Probably the last couple years.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: And is this a tool? How often do you use this tool, whether it's with the Va or or any other online.

> P7: Oh, I use! I use it daily.

Thomas: Okay, alright.

Thomas: And so today, you, you've mentioned to me that you're using the android phone for today. Is that correct?

> P7: Yes.

Thomas: Okay. Alright.

Thomas: Let's see one just a

Thomas: Just before we begin here, you've mentioned that you have used zoom while using this tool before.

Thomas: And is it okay? If you want to start sharing your screen with with us. So we can navigate you to the website that we're going to be testing today.

> P7: Yeah.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: So if you want to start sharing, and then I am going to get.

> P7: I'm trying to find the.

Thomas: Yeah.

> P7: The prompt for that.

Thomas: Okay.

> P7: Oh, here we go.

> P7: Okay.

> P7: You still there, Thomas.

Thomas: Yeah, I I I was just gonna wait to see if I I haven't seen anything change on my screen yet. I still just

Thomas: see our names up on screen.

Thomas: so I don't see your screen yet.

> P7: Well you disappeared.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: Hmm.

> P7: Me see.

> P7: I don't know where you went.

Thomas: Okay, are, maybe. Are you still in zoom?

> P7: Well, I would have to be on in zoom.

Thomas: Okay.

> P7: Because that's how we connected the call.

Thomas: Right. What are you? What are you currently seeing on your screen, on your phone?

> P7: Appear on top.

Thomas: Okay.

> P7: This permission allows an app to show things on top of other apps you're using.

> P7: This may interfere

> P7: with the use of other apps.

Tyler: [P7], does it say something else like that you need to confirm?

Tyler: Or

> P7: Yeah, I did confirm.

Tyler: Okay.

> P7: Let's see here. Oh, wait a minute.

> P7: Did that change anything.

Thomas: Nothing. Yet

Thomas: hmm.

Tyler: Can you describe what you're seeing? One more time

Tyler: from kind of top to bottom of the screen?

> P7: Oh, it's a whole!

> P7: It says

> P7: the paragraph that I read to you. Then it's got

> P7: a whole list of

> P7: things.

> P7: including zoom

> P7: in, including zoom.

Tyler: Okay. So it sounds like you're probably in your settings where you need to give permission to zoom so that you can share your screen.

> P7: Give it permission.

Tyler: Okay. So then you might need to go back to zoom.

Tyler: So do you know how to change applications on your phone?

> P7: I don't know why this why you disappeared. That's what I'm trying to figure out.

Tyler: Yeah, I can see how that's confusing. So I think what happened is, you were on the zoom window, and then when you asked it to share screen. It took you to your settings, probably.

> P7: Yes.

Tyler: Yeah. So now we're at settings. So that's why you can't see Thomas anymore.

Tyler: So we just need to get back to that application. So there's different ways on different phones. So I might not be super helpful. But like on my phone, I swipe up, and then I can see different applications. Or maybe you will click something differently. I know you're using a pointer device to get to your application. So you know, if you wanted to go send an email like to find your other applications. Do you know how you do that?

> P7: No.

Thomas: Hmm.

Tyler: Okay?

Tyler: Hmm.

Tyler: what about if you

Tyler: you're on an android right?

> P7: Yes.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: I'm just gonna look to see if I can figure out how to get to home.

Tyler: Yeah. So it says, you should swipe up from the bottom of the screen, but I know that you might. That might be different when you're using your pointer device.

> P7: Yes, it's.

Tyler: Time.

> P7: Different, apparently.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P7: Oh, okay, here we go. Now I've got Tyler. Is that you.

Tyler: Yeah, that's me. That that means you're back at Zoom. That's perfect.

> P7: Him.

Tyler: Now, why don't you try clicking share again? So it'll be on that same zoom window where you can see my name. It's gonna have a share

Tyler: button.

Tyler: and let us know what you're seeing.

> P7: I see?

> P7: I can. Okay, participation chat.

> P7: Reaction share.

Tyler: Perfect. So we'll click, share.

> P7: That's what I did last time, and you disappeared.

Tyler: Yeah. So we'll see this time it might happen again. But hopefully, not we think that maybe the settings have been updated this time. So let's try and click, share.

> P7: Okay.

> P7: Now I have more choices.

Tyler: Okay? So it's probably letting you choose different windows. Is that what it seems like.

> P7: Photo.

> P7: photo, image from file, document.

> P7: web, URL, screen.

> P7: yes, camera.

Tyler: Screen.

> P7: Okay, start recording. This includes information passwords. Blah, blah, okay? And I push start now.

> P7: And it takes me back to that.

Tyler: Hmm.

> P7: Well, wait a minute. You're still in the corner here.

Tyler: Oh, interesting!

Tyler: What are you seeing besides us in the corner? What else are you seeing now?

> P7: That list of things that I told you before.

Tyler: Okay, can we go through the list? I know this is annoying for you. I'm sorry to make you do this, but can you just start to read some of the words in that list?

> P7: Yeah.

Tyler: Thank you.

Tyler: and if you read them out loud we might be able to help.

> P7: Okay.

> P7: always on display. And it, this is a toggle switch. It's either on or off.

Tyler: Right? Okay.

> P7: Always on display.

> P7: Android auto

> P7: a R. Doodle. Have no idea what that is.

> P7: A R. Emoji.

> P7: a. R. Emoji stickers

> P7: authentication framework.

> P7: Autofill with Samsung

> P7: Bixby, Bixby voice.

> P7: Paul.

> P7: camera, clock.

> P7: content manager.

Tyler: This is really helpful. So you can. You can stop there. It sounds like we're looking at a list of applications. And then this is, give you giving them permission to show things. So that's why there's a little toggle. So if the toggle is blue, it means that it's on.

> P7: Sad, right.

Tyler: Yeah, perfect. So if we scroll down to the bottom of the screen, most likely because Zoom has a Z

Tyler: we'll probably try and find the zoom application, and then let us know if it's blue or gray on the toggle.

> P7: Right now. It's gray.

Tyler: It's gray. Okay, let's switch it to Blue.

> P7: Okay.

Tyler: Okay, perfect. So I think, now, what's happened is you're allowing Zoom to share your screen. So we're gonna go back to Zoom, where you can see my name again.

> P7: Alright!

Tyler: And then we're gonna try it again. And this time everyone's gonna cross their fingers.

Tyler: So let us know when you're back at Zoom.

Tyler: Oh, perfect.

Thomas: Yay!

Tyler: All right. I'm going to hand it back over to Thomas. Thank you, [P7].

> P7: Thank you.

Thomas: Alright. So now we'll navigate over to chrome.

Thomas: So we can open up a web page.

> P7: Alright!

Thomas: Okay, we've navigated back over to Zoom.

> P7: Yes.

Thomas: So now if we could navigate it. And now we're gonna try to open up, we'll need a web browser.

Thomas: so if we can go over to Chrome.

Thomas: are you just? Are you? Are you able to move over to Chrome, [P7]? Or can you hear me.

> P7: I can hear you.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: Nope.

Thomas: looks like it's still within zoom. At this moment.

> P7: Well, here again we go. I don't know how to get there.

SK: Hi, [P7], my name is Sk. I'm an accessibility specialist on the team.

SK: Could you just click that home button?

> P7: I shouldn't.

SK: Yeah.

SK: the bottom of your screen, or you could take your finger and swipe up at the bottom of the screen. I think that should bring you back to the home

SK: if you.

> P7: No, it's not.

SK: If you tap on the middle of the screen, I think your home button should populate at the bottom of the

SK: screen.

> P7: But that's not

> P7: those aren't. That isn't 1 of my options

> P7: I've got

> P7: at the bottom of my screen.

> P7: I've got

> P7: mute share.

> P7: video or

> P7: yeah, video

> P7: participation chat

> P7: reaction stop

> P7: record.

> P7: A, I.

SK: Why don't we try selecting the link in the chat

SK: so that way? You don't have to open up a new browser window.

SK: so if you navigate to the chat button, we drop the link in there for you, and you should be able to navigate to the

SK: mural.

> P7: Okay. I'm on the chat. I've got your chat.

Thomas: Yeah.

Thomas: with a comment.

SK: Go ahead and click that link.

SK: Beautiful.

Thomas: Perfect. We're exactly where we need to be, [P7]. That was.

> P7: Awesome, great.

Thomas: Yay!

> P7: Oh, yeah, I recognize this site.

Thomas: Okay.

### Form

Thomas: So now that we're here, I'm going to give you a little bit of a scenario. Okay? And if you ever need me to remind you of this. Just let me know.

Thomas: So in this one, what we're going to be doing is that this is a tool, as you can see here, it's called, Ask Va.

Thomas: and it's a again. This is a way for veterans to to contact the Va and ask a question online.

Thomas: Now for today's session, we're going to pretend, like you're going to ask the Va a question about a recent experience that you had at a Va Medical Center.

Thomas: Okay? And again, I can remind you of this scenario whenever you need me to. So it's about you asking a question about a recent experience you had at the Va Medical Center or at a Va medical center. Okay.

> P7: Okay.

Thomas: So as you navigate, we just want to understand what's kind of going through your mind, how your assistive technology is supporting you. And so as you start the form here, I'm really gonna just try to remain quiet. And so you can focus in on the task. And at at this moment just again. Whenever you're kind of going through a page, you can talk about it out loud, and then just keep going through it. If you ever have any questions? Don't hesitate to ask me. How's that sound?

> P7: From you.

> P7: Okay.

Thomas: Okay.

> P7: Ask a new question.

> P7: Alright! Continue

Thomas: And, [P7], whenever if you ever want to like, just talk about what you're seeing and what you're thinking about, that also helps us out as well. I don't want to like interrupt as you're kind of going through this, so I want you to just like stay in the flow as well.

> P7: Okay. Alright.

> P7: Okay. Now, here's a

> P7: potential.

> P7: It's giving me a choice. How should we contact you?

> P7: Phone call

> P7: fat chance

> P7: email.

> P7: I seem to have the best luck with email, but I don't always

> P7: trust it. And then if you want

> P7: snail mail.

> P7: So you actually have a document.

> P7: Now, I'm gonna choose email.

> P7: cause I can download the email or upload it.

> P7: Alright.

> P7: Okay.

> P7: don't receive anything

> P7: outside of the Us.

> P7: But yet they want a Zip code

> P7: I'll just put. But

> P7: oh.

> P7: I put in my own zip code, and they took that as an off base.

> P7: That's

> P7: strange.

Thomas: Okay.

> P7: Editing answers.

> P7: my family

> P7: plucked away there.

> P7: Name

> P7: your postal code. Okay.

Thomas: And [P7], before you click on, submit the question, or.

> P7: I already did.

### Cool down

Thomas: That's okay. That's all right. You went through the form super fast. And so I would just like to like, hear a little bit about what you thought about the form?

Thomas: So

Thomas: going from beginning to end like this, how was how was that for you? How was that experience.

> P7: Well, it was easy, but they did not.

> P7: I noticed, did. Can you see my stuff that I've put in there?

Thomas: Yes.

> P7: Okay.

> P7: they had nothing that really correlated

> P7: with.

> P7: Would the question I asked.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: Can you talk to me a little bit about that? What were you? What would you expect.

> P7: Another box that says something like.

> P7: See, I don't consider it a prosthetic.

> P7: But nothing else even comes close to

> P7: what I'm asking.

> P7: The choices.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: So with the question that you submitted about the wheelchair. Nothing really put that there. There wasn't anything for the category, nor the topic that really fit what you were looking for.

> P7: No.

Thomas: Okay, all right.

Thomas: What would be something like in terms of maybe what you would suggest that would

Thomas: kind of help to at that at that beginning section. Is there anything that would would probably help with that.

> P7: Yeah. Durable medical equipment

> P7: should be a

> P7: one of the choices, because there's a lot of veterans with crutches and braces, and

> P7: and that's all durable medical equipment.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: that's super helpful. Thank you. That's not something. That I

Thomas: had really thought of. So that that's great, that providing that feedback. Is there anything that was else that was particularly challenging? About using this this form at all?

> P7: So I I thought it was simple.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: one of the things that I'm not able to do normally, one of the things that would be really great on doing a research study like this is actually watching you. Like navigate through the site in person. Can you explain a little bit to me about your assistive device and how you use it with the phone is, is this a physical pointer device, or is it digital.

> P7: Digital.

Thomas: Is it okay? Can you tell me a little bit about your pointer device? What? What is it? What is it like? What does it do?

> P7: It. It'll just allow me to

> P7: make a choice on a screen.

Thomas: Okay?

Thomas: And is it how you're looking at the screen? Is it something below the screen?

Thomas: could you give me a little bit more information about that.

Thomas: So when you're.

> P7: Yeah, it's on the screen.

Thomas: Okay, alright.

Thomas: So what I'm seeing right now, when you, when you move up and down the screen, is, are you using your head to moving that

> P7: Now.

Thomas: Okay.

> P7: I'm using a finger.

Thomas: You're using a finger. Okay? All right.

Thomas: When you went from page to page or clicking on a button, was that using your finger? Or was that using your assistive device.

> P7: My finger.

325
00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:30.150
Thomas: Okay. Alright!

326
00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:32.070
> P7: In this case, yeah.

327
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:32.720
Thomas: Okay.

328
00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:43.500
Thomas: is there any point, during during the time that we were working on this, that you had to be using a some type of a pointer device other than your finger.

329
00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:44.770
> P7: No.

330
00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:45.850
Thomas: Okay, alright.

331
00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:54.810
Thomas: at at one of the other things that I'm really interested about is as you're progressing through the form.

332
00:29:55.276 --> 00:30:02.559
Thomas: Did you ever notice that something had said that you were like 20% through the form or 30% through the form.

333
00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:03.480
> P7: Yes.

334
00:30:03.850 --> 00:30:07.899
Thomas: How did you? Did that help you at all? How did you feel about that?

335
00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:11.220
> P7: Wow!

336
00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:15.010
> P7: It gives you an indication as to

337
00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:18.310
> P7: how much

338
00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:20.470
> P7: longer you're going to be.

339
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:21.080
Thomas: Okay.

340
00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:22.095
> P7: But

341
00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:26.780
> P7: in general. If if I feel if

342
00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:30.800
> P7: someone's going to that page anyway.

343
00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:36.479
> P7: it doesn't matter if that's there or not, because they're gonna complete it

344
00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:37.750
> P7: to the end.

345
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:39.800
> P7: Okay.

346
00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:54.269
Thomas: Was there anything else that you would change, or or is there anything that you would change about the experience of this form you you had mentioned with regards to the the category of the topic. But is there anything else that you would change about the experience of the form.

347
00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:01.460
> P7: No, I the it like I said before, it's it's

348
00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:03.730
> P7: it's simple. So

349
00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:08.370
> P7: you know, there's really nothing complicated about it.

350
00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:10.140
Thomas: Okay.

351
00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:13.019
> P7: You don't. You don't need to know anything

352
00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:15.879
> P7: special other than you know

353
00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:20.290
> P7: your own problem right?

354
00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:22.090
Thomas: Okay.

355
00:31:24.391 --> 00:31:32.820
Thomas: [P7], one of the things that I was wondering about in terms of like, when you use the pointer device.

356
00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:47.829
Thomas: would there have been any. Part of of this, whether it was like entering information using the keyboard that you would have normally used the pointer device, or that you would have needed the pointer device.

357
00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:52.070
> P7: Now.

358
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:53.140
Thomas: Okay. Alright.

359
00:31:55.300 --> 00:32:04.749
Thomas: Could you give me an example of a time where you would normally use or or need the pointer device to to navigate a website.

360
00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:14.429
> P7: Sometimes it makes it easier.

361
00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:16.830
> P7: To make choices.

362
00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:18.850
> P7: but

363
00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:20.166
> P7: and it

364
00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:22.859
> P7: on this particular

365
00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:24.720
> P7: form.

366
00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:27.830
> P7: I didn't need it.

367
00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:29.389
Thomas: Okay. Alright

368
00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:41.050
Thomas: it. Is there a time that you could tell me, or or explain a previous time that you needed to use something like that.

369
00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:43.469
Thomas: The using your pointer device.

370
00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:46.140
> P7: Not on a Va. Site.

371
00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:47.980
Thomas: Oh, really okay, alright

372
00:32:53.780 --> 00:33:08.659
Thomas: And in terms of being able to. All of the other information, was it? Does everything make sense in terms of the wording. Was it was there anything that you found confusing at all?

373
00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:12.709
> P7: No, I didn't find any of it confusing.

374
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:13.890
Thomas: Okay. Alright!

375
00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:16.410
> P7: But see.

376
00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:18.275
> P7: I'm

377
00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:21.449
> P7: I'm a medical person.

378
00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:30.689
> P7: To begin with. I'm a retired nurse, and the last 18 years of my career I worked in the insurance end of it.

379
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.210
> P7: So

380
00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:40.729
> P7: I'm i i would think I'm more knowledgeable about this type of thing than a lot of people.

381
00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:46.130
> P7: which is why, I think this is

Thomas: Okay.

418
00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:14.429
Thomas: When you receive information back from the Va. One of the questions that we had is, do you receive messaging through secure messaging, or another channel.

419
00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:16.250
> P7: Secure messaging.

420
00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:16.870
Thomas: Okay.

421
00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:47.630
Thomas: I'm going to see if there was anything else that my team had wanted to ask and it doesn't look like it at this moment. [P7], we've gone through this very fast. I I know that we had a lot more time scheduled for this, but you made it super simple to kind of get through everything. And do you have any question further questions for us at all?

422
00:36:51.565 --> 00:36:55.750
> P7: When are you expecting this? Ask Va to be

423
00:36:57.150 --> 00:36:58.400
> P7: completed?

424
00:36:58.600 --> 00:36:59.190
Thomas: Okay.

425
00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:01.711
Thomas: that's that's a great question.

426
00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:11.403
Thomas: I'm not sure if Tyler has an estimate. But at at this moment.

427
00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:20.079
Tyler: Yeah, we. So right now, [P7], you can use ask Va. Thomas mentioned at the beginning. It's it's separate to Vagov.

428
00:37:20.556 --> 00:37:40.170
Tyler: It's called. Ask Dot Vagov. So it's a separate website, so you can use it right now. But we're working on improving it. It'll look different to what you just looked at right now. And in, let's say the near future. You'll be able to use this version of the of the tool when it goes on. Va Gov.

429
00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:43.529
> P7: Okay? So if I

430
00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:49.820
> P7: used this tool, let's say today, ask va.gov.

431
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:52.580
> P7: who answers those questions

432
00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:57.079
> P7: that you may have, where where does this go?

433
00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:04.299
Tyler: What's your instinct? What do you? Who do you think answers them.

434
00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:07.260
> P7: Well, I would hope the Va. Answers them.

435
00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:15.089
> P7: But that's why I'm asking.

436
00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:20.620
> P7: I mean, if it's somebody that's

437
00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:31.139
> P7: not affiliated with the Va, that's making a decision about, you know.

438
00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:36.829
> P7: if I should pass this on or not.

439
00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:42.059
> P7: I I would like to know where it goes.

440
00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:42.730
Thomas: Okay.

441
00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:52.160
Thomas: no, that's that's a great question. And that's, you know, for for all of the categories that you you saw at the very beginning.

442
00:38:52.170 --> 00:39:09.550
Thomas: All of those categories are are business lines that are within the Va and that's really kind of where this is supposed to. You know, be channeled. All the questions depending upon you know where you're looking at or getting information from.

443
00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:23.819
Thomas: That's basically where it would kind of need to go within the Va, so so your concern of is the Va asking or or responding to the to the responses, to your questions. That's

444
00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:29.760
Thomas: yeah. Basically, is, is organizations, different business lines within the the Va. Yes.

445
00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:30.510
> P7: Okay.

446

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:37.990
> P7: In my Va. In my area, or in any Va. In the Us.

448
00:39:38.490 --> 00:39:44.429
Thomas: That is a very good question. I don't know if I necessarily have the answer. To that one.

449
00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:47.680
Tyler: That depends on your question, [P7]. So if you were asking like

450
00:39:48.068 --> 00:40:06.330
Tyler: you know, a general question about like what life insurance benefits are available, then it'll be like a more general office. That's just answering those types of questions. But then there's certain things. That's why we might ask for your health facility or your postcode, like we did today. And then.

451
00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:06.660
> P7: To be.

452
00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:10.979
Tyler: Because we want to get to the right Va medical center that can answer your question.

453
00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:12.929
Tyler: So it depends.

454
00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:14.840

00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:31.125

456
00:40:31.630 --> 00:41:00.669
Thomas: with with the feedback that we've gotten today that we can continue to to work on making these improvements, and that in in the future again, this would be over with over@va.gov say, like going into contact us, and then and finding. Ask Va a question there. But I just I wanted to to say, Thank you so much for your time today, and we really appreciate all the feedback that you've you've provided for us.
