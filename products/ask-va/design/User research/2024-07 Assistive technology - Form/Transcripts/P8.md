### Warm up


Tyler: Alright. So I started the recording, and I just want to confirm, are you comfortable? If I record my screen and audio today.

> P8: Yes.

Tyler: Awesome.

Tyler: Thanks, [P8]. So that was a lot of information. And we met a lot of people. Do you have any questions for me? At this point.

Tyler: Nope, okay, awesome.

Tyler: Well, before we jump into getting your feedback, I'd love to learn just a little bit more about you and your experience with the Va how long have you been a veteran?

> P8: How long have I been a veteran, or with Va.

8
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.129

9
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:39.870

10
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:40.880
Tyler: 9 years.

11
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.770
> P8: Yeah.

12
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.819
> P8: yeah, that's what I was blind

13
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.010
> P8: when I became legally blind. That was 9 years ago.

14
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.880
Tyler: Okay.

15
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.200
> P8: That's when I signed up with Va.

16
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.609
Tyler: Gotcha. Okay? But you got out of service. Longer.

17
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.940
> P8: So, not.

18
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:55.450
Tyler: Years ago.

19
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.610
> P8: Service was back in 69 to 71.

20
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:06.229
Tyler: Gotcha. Okay? So you got out of service. But you didn't interact with the Va until you became legally blind.

21
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:07.359
> P8: That's right.

22
00:01:07.671 --> 00:01:13.269
Tyler: Okay, that makes sense. And when that happened, how did you get in touch with the va.

23
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.650
> P8: I called the best coordinator.

24
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.179
Tyler: Okay, you called. Sorry I missed that. You called some coordinator.

25
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.469
> P8: This visual impairment service

26
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.240
> P8: got it? Yeah.

27
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.540
Tyler: Okay.

28
00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:38.869
Tyler: okay, that makes sense. You called over the phone. Do you? Usually prefer to call when you're trying to get in touch with somebody.

29
00:01:40.935 --> 00:01:41.850
> P8: Actually

30
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.200
> P8: recall.

31
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.700
> P8: I think I think what happened was we called the Vis Coordinator, and she told us.

32
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.050
> P8: go online

33
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.419
> P8: to enroll.

34
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.130
> P8: But it's like wife did that. I didn't do it.

35
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.469
> P8: and she didn't tell me she was gonna do it. Actually.

36
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:09.070
> P8: she said she just wanted the Via coverage. Oh, we we found out about

37
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.530
> P8: Va's blind rehab

38
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.920
> P8: as she wanted me to attend. So

39
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.530
> P8: she right away she went online and enrolled.

40
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.200
Tyler: Okay, got it. So

41
00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:30.289
Tyler: your wife went in online and enrolled for you is that is that a common experience where your wife might step in, to, to help with certain things.

42
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.140
> P8: Yeah, actually, she does. She does most of it. So what we're going through is

43
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.739
> P8: it's it's like.

44
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.510
> P8: I may not have ever done it before.

45
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:51.270
> P8: so so like with my healthy vet, the ordering of prescriptions, the reordering of prescriptions. She goes on to my healthy vet

46
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.680
> P8: to reorder.

47
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.730
Tyler: Got it? Yeah.

48
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.210
Tyler: that makes sense.

49
00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:03.809
Tyler: How do? How do you feel? About that? Is it helpful to have your wife do that? Do you sometimes wish you were doing it? How do you feel about that?

50
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.570
> P8: I love to delegate.

51
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.620
Tyler: Yeah, I get that. I need to get better at delegation.

52
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.990
> P8: Sorry.

53
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.119
> P8: My! I guess my abilities. I could.

54
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.149
> P8: I can do it myself.

55
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.000
> P8: But if somebody else can do it for me.

56
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.700
> P8: I've got to ask that person to do it.

57
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.350
Tyler: Okay.

58
00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.789
Tyler: that makes sense.

59
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:35.500
Tyler: So your wife might have more experience with some of the Va like tools and services than you might have, because she's she's helping do it on your behalf.

60
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.000
> P8: Yeah, yeah.

61
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.950
Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

62
00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:52.020
Tyler: awesome. Well, we're gonna talk a little bit more about one way of contacting the Va today. And I'll tell you a little bit more about it in a minute. But

63
00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:58.260
Tyler: I think at this point what we can do is get set up using the website.

64
00:03:58.965 --> 00:04:07.430
Tyler: So let's 1st get you set up sharing your screen. Have you shared your screen on Zoom before.

65
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.380
> P8: I think I have

66
00:04:11.062 --> 00:04:13.839
> P8: sharing my screen with you and

67
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.359
> P8: the others who are sitting in.

68
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:29.879
Tyler: Yes, yeah, exactly. So you'll basically navigate to it should say, share or share screen. And then that way, we're going to be able to see what's on your screen while you're navigating around.

69
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:36.530
Tyler: So do you. Do you want to go ahead and share your screen and just let us know if you're having any any issues.

70
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.770
> P8: Okay? So

71
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.740
> P8: I just

72
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.995
> P8: search for that share that share the screen.

73
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:54.610
Tyler: Yeah. So we're on the zoom window now, and you're gonna navigate to the controls on zoom. So it's kind of like when you were trying to turn yourself on and off mute?

74
00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.840
Tyler: So there's a control, and it said should say, share screen

75
00:04:59.615 --> 00:05:12.440
Tyler: so if you try and do that. I was kind of able to hear your screen, reader, earlier when you joined, but we might not be able to hear your screen, reader super clearly, which is not a problem. But just so, you know.

76
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.259
> P8: Okay. So all I'm doing is from the top. I'm swiping right.

77
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.030
Tyler: Okay.

78
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.480
Tyler: And what are you hearing? Once you swipe right?

79
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.650
> P8: I was

80
00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.510
> P8: Zoom Meeting

81
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.699
> P8: zoom audio

82
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.820
> P8: mute

83
00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.350
> P8: keypad.

84
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.210
> P8: selected speaker.

85
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.390
> P8: add video.

86
00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.580
> P8: and then and I don't. I didn't hear any sharing.

87
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.010
Tyler: Okay.

88
00:05:53.980 --> 00:06:01.450
Tyler: that yeah, that sounded like it was like all to do with with mute and audio. And then, like video settings right?

89
00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.110
> P8: Yeah, yeah.

90
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.889
Tyler: Okay. I'm gonna ask Jamie if she has any idea what

91
00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.090
Tyler: what screen we might be on right now.

92
00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:14.460
Jamie: Yeah. If you if you swipe right one more time. What do you hear?

93
00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.799
> P8: I'm at the top again with Zoom audio.

94
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.850
> P8: really

95
00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:26.430
> P8: keypad. Okay? Like the speaker, add

96
00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.009
> P8: sounded like ad

97
00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:29.770
> P8: video.

98
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.190
> P8: zoom.

99
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.320
> P8: and called.

100
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.940
Tyler: Hmm.

101
00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.760
Jamie: Oh, interesting. Okay, let me think

102
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.890
Jamie: so. You have a keyboard plugged in right.

103
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.190
> P8: Yes.

104
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.260
Jamie: Okay? So in theory.

105
00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:54.669
Jamie: that means you could use like keyboard shortcuts

106
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:59.189
Jamie: to access stuff. So that's what that's what I'm hoping is gonna work here.

107
00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.080
Jamie: excuse me.

108
00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:06.409
Jamie: let me find the shortcut. For

109
00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.059
Jamie: to share your screen. One moment.

110
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:12.590
Tyler: Thanks. Jamie.

111
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.130
Jamie: Yeah, sure. Say, sure thing.

112
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.510
Jamie: let's see.

113
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.759
Jamie: I'm gonna find it.

114
00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.529
Tyler: I think it might be shift command. S.

115
00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.020
Jamie: Yeah, I think so.

116
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.589
Jamie: Yeah, I would give that a try.

117
00:07:40.167 --> 00:07:44.750
Jamie: Or it's a, it's a Mac. So it would be command control. S.

118
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:47.599
Jamie: Is a shortcut to.

119
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:49.000
> P8: Okay.

120
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:55.979
> P8: I don't know. I don't usually use the command key or use this keyboard often. So.

121
00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:57.190
Jamie: No problem.

122
00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:58.670
> P8: I mean yes.

123
00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.260
Jamie: That's okay.

124
00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.039
> P8: Command Key. To the

125
00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:04.699
> P8: left of the space bar.

126
00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:06.040
Tyler: Yes.

127
00:08:08.784 --> 00:08:11.329
Tyler: and then the control key is.

128
00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:17.449
Tyler: you skip over one key. You keep going left from command. You skip one key, and it's the next key.

129
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:19.810
Tyler: Exactly.

130
00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:20.680
> P8: As far as

131
00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.240
> P8: the control is next to the spacebar.

132
00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:28.259
Tyler: The command is next to the spacebar.

133
00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:28.950
> P8: Yeah.

134
00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:31.920
Tyler: The left, on the left side.

135
00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:32.610
> P8: The space.

136
00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:33.330
Tyler: Are.

137
00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:37.170
> P8: And control is, does. Next to a command.

138
00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:41.930
Tyler: Almost. It's 1 over to the left. So it's command.

139
00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:43.070
Tyler: skip.

140
00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:44.360
Tyler: control.

141
00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:47.390
> P8: And

142
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:51.240
> P8: okay, this is, I have a problem.

143
00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:57.339
> P8: the shift. I hope I got the shift key.

144
00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:01.369
> P8: Then I hit the spot where it's like that.

145
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:05.119
Tyler: You also have to click. S. Were you also clicking? S.

146
00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.649
> P8: Oh, I don't think I got it.

147
00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:08.340
Tyler: Okay.

148
00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.210
> P8: Can you hear me?

149
00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:12.349
Tyler: I can still hear you. Can you hear me?

150
00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.649
> P8: Yeah, I know. Cause when I press the one button it said, New.

151
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:18.420
Tyler: Okay, no, I can still hear you.

152
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:23.738
> P8: So if I, if I turned off the keyboard

153
00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.350
> P8: when we go back to the screen.

154
00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:27.950
Jamie: Okay.

155
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:35.849
> P8: So well, let's about show one more time. So one of my problems, I don't know where the shift key is.

156
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.829
> P8: cause I don't use. People often.

157
00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:50.399
Tyler: Yeah, that's okay. I mean, so it's up to you. If you don't use the keyboard often, it's okay to use the ipad. If that's what you prefer to use the screen. There is that your preference.

158
00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:55.859
> P8: Well, it's gonna be a new like a new experience doing either way.

159
00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.070
Tyler: Okay, so.

160
00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:02.120
> P8: I'm turning off, though.

161
00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.110
Jamie: Okay.

162
00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:05.980
> P8: People aren't.

163
00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:15.720
> P8: That's.

164
00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.520
Jamie: The

165
00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:18.230
Jamie: excuse me.

166
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:28.360
Jamie: yeah, so on on zoom. My understanding is that there, there's a few controls that

167
00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.429
Jamie: should be available to you

168
00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:34.969
Jamie: toward the top of the screen

169
00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:39.820
Jamie: visually. So one of them is muting and unmuting yourself.

170
00:10:40.911 --> 00:10:44.490
Jamie: Another is stop video or start video.

171
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:52.039
Jamie: And then and then the one after that is share content. And that's how you would share with us.

172
00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:15.800
> P8: I've done your share.

173
00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:16.980
Jamie: Okay.

174
00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:22.184
Jamie: I'm trying to figure out where you are.

175
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.360
Jamie: Excuse me.

176
00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.449
Jamie: Where else might you be?

177
00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:29.634
Jamie: Did did you hear a

178
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:34.099
Jamie: Something that said more, and there's like a menu

179
00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:37.300
Jamie: or.

180
00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:38.430
> P8: Oh! Or is it?

181
00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:39.720
> P8: Hold on!

182
00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.050
> P8: There's an ad.

183
00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:57.960
Jamie: There's an ad.

184
00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:58.430
Tyler: Hmm.

185
00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:02.439
> P8: Sounds like and.

186
00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:04.580
Jamie: Huh!

187
00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:07.040
Jamie: That's interesting.

188
00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.960
Jamie: That makes me wonder if

189
00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:13.659
Jamie: if you're on the window

190
00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.230
Jamie: at all.

191
00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:20.020
Jamie: Like if you're if you're in zoom, or if you're somewhere else.

192
00:12:21.602 --> 00:12:25.457
Jamie: Do you know how to go back to

193
00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:29.130
Jamie: The home screen on your ipad?

194
00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:33.250
> P8: How do I do that.

195
00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:34.130
Jamie: Okay.

196
00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:36.270
Jamie: Let me.

197
00:12:37.285 --> 00:12:38.010
> P8: Look.

198
00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:38.770
Jamie: Yeah.

199
00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.360
Jamie: or maybe

200
00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:48.169
Jamie: or I mean, Zoom has to be open. So maybe it would be better to go into like all the open apps.

201
00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:50.930
Jamie: Let's see.

202
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.290
Jamie: I'm going to look that up really quickly.

203
00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:59.089
Tyler: Thanks, Jamie [P8]. Were you saying that you could hear app.

204
00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:00.880
Tyler: or add

205
00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:02.520
Tyler: with a.

206
00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.070
> P8: Sorry. What is that? Again.

207
00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:17.730
Tyler: I was just pausing. I think your screen reader was

208
00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:19.150
Tyler: announcing.

209
00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.180
Tyler: Is it quiet now?

210
00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:26.310
Tyler: Huh?

211
00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:32.840
> P8: Now it's like

212
00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:38.780
> P8: it sounds like it stopped. I tapped on. I thought, what sounded like ad.

213
00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.860
> P8: I have thought that

214
00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.370
> P8: button. And now

215
00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:48.080
> P8: there's nothing on this, as far as I can tell.

216
00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:51.409
Tyler: Nothing on the screen. You're not hearing anything now.

217
00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:52.025
> P8: No.

218
00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.060
Tyler: Hmm.

219
00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:59.339
Tyler: okay, we'll we'll wait for Jamie to to try and.

220
00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:05.090
Jamie: Yeah, let's so, okay, so what we think might be happening is that

221
00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:08.369
Jamie: you might have like a different app open.

222
00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:19.389
Jamie: So Zoom is running in the background so we can hear you. But you might have something else like live and in focus. And that's why we're kind of hearing 2 different things.

223
00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:23.300
Jamie: So what you can, what we want you to do

224
00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:24.410
Jamie: is

225
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:31.049
Jamie: basically like switch to the zoom app so to do that. Here's what the instructions say.

226
00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:39.810
Jamie: drag one finger up from the bottom of the screen until you hear 3 tones, and then lift your finger.

227
00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:52.500
> P8: No.

228
00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:56.340
Jamie: That not working.

229
00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:58.170
> P8: I.

230
00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:07.540
Jamie: So so in theory, what's supposed to happen is you? You hear these 3 tones, you lift your finger.

231
00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:11.979
Jamie: and that pulls up like all the open applications.

232
00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:12.660
Jamie: Then you.

233
00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:13.850
> P8: Yeah. So

234
00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:16.579
> P8: I'm on the app app switcher.

235
00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:19.190
Jamie: Perfect. That's awesome. So now

236
00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:21.699
Jamie: pipe left or right.

237
00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:27.530
Jamie: you'll hear what apps are available to you, and then you could double tap when you get to zoom.

238
00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:31.839
> P8: Oh, sorry! Something was wrong, so right now it's it looks like

239
00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:34.190
> P8: my mail app

240
00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:35.600
> P8: is what's

241
00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:37.060
> P8: active.

242
00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:43.219
Jamie: Okay, got it. So if if you swipe to the right, what do you hear?

243
00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:47.700
> P8: Zoom, perfect.

244
00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:50.349
Jamie: Perfect. All right. Now. Double tap on that.

245
00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:52.769
> P8: If I tap on the zoom

246
00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:54.640
> P8: it should become

247
00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:56.460
> P8: like the primary.

248
00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:58.170
Jamie: That's exactly it.

249
00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:13.160
Jamie: Alright.

250
00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:16.419
Jamie: So now that you've done that

251
00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:19.870
Jamie: in theory again.

252
00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:27.810
Jamie: you should be able to swipe around until you hear something that says, share, share, content, share, screens.

253
00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:28.950
> P8: Yeah, okay.

254
00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.619
> P8: it said. I'm at.

255
00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:58.960
> P8: I'm at a selection

256
00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:02.040
> P8: call to hear others join. Audio.

257
00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:07.209
> P8: Is that sounds like I'm so I should tap on that.

258
00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:10.550
> P8: although I'm hearing everybody.

259
00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:12.759
Tyler: Yeah, I think you've already done that.

260
00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:15.060
Tyler: Huh?

261
00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:19.979
Jamie: Well, if you keep going to the right, what do you hear?

262
00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:27.229
> P8: So 1st until here others please join audio.

263
00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:29.300
> P8: Huh?

264
00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.820
Jamie: I'm trying to figure out where that would be.

265
00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:39.769
Jamie: Tyler's looking too.

266
00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:46.479
Tyler: Yeah, yeah, it's it's odd, because that makes sense like at the beginning, [P8], when you weren't connected to audio.

267
00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:50.709
Tyler: you probably clicked something like that, said join Audio.

268
00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:56.239
Tyler: but it wouldn't prompt you to do that once your audio is connected.

269
00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:03.040
Jamie: Yeah, and we can definitely hear you.

270
00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:07.080
Jamie: Oh, it's a little man! It's a little strange.

271
00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:11.869
> P8: This is the second time this has happened to me.

272
00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:13.900
Jamie: Oh no!

273
00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:16.330
> P8: But we couldn't. We couldn't log on.

274
00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:35.370
Tyler: Are you.

275
00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:38.920
Tyler: [P8]? Are you hearing anything that says?

276
00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:41.619
Tyler: Displaying Tyler's video.

277
00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:43.810
> P8: No.

278
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:46.520
Tyler: Did you say no?

279
00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:50.220
> P8: Hmm!

280
00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:51.870
> P8: I'm

281
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:19.540
> P8: no.

282
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:30.119
Tyler: Oh, let me know when there's a break.

283
00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:49.459
> P8: So when I go to switch app. And now I'm at the Zoom video.

284
00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:54.260
> P8: It's coming up with the same thing again.

285
00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:58.190
Tyler: The same list of options. So you're.

286
00:19:58.190 --> 00:19:59.910
> P8: No audio.

287
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:15.720
Tyler: Yeah, it almost sounds like you're in like a a menu, for that's just to do with audio and video.

288
00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:19.459
Tyler: because you're not hearing options that have like

289
00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:25.520
Tyler: chat or participants, or anything like that, right.

290
00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:27.840
Tyler: What kinds of things were you hearing just now?

291
00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:01.949
> P8: So now I'm having. I found that share.

292
00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:02.840
Tyler: Okay.

293
00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:07.330
> P8: And now I'm getting a a list of like the 1st one

294
00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.480
> P8: Microsoft onedrive.

295
00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:12.460
Tyler: Okay.

296
00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:13.810
> P8: Fair, point.

297
00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:16.370
> P8: Google, drive.

298
00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:23.190
Tyler: I think if you keep going, it might say screen. I think I've heard that before.

299
00:22:25.966 --> 00:22:29.630
Jamie: It's it's a menu of things you can share.

300
00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:33.669
Jamie: and the one you want is the one that says screen.

301
00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:38.830
> P8: Whiteboard

302
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:42.190
> P8: website. URL

303
00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:45.260
> P8: sounds like Fox or Vox.

304
00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.070
> P8: Google drive.

305
00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.710
> P8: Microsoft Sharepoint.

306
00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:53.629
> P8: Microsoft, onedrive dropbox.

307
00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:56.230
> P8: icloud drive

308
00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:57.880
> P8: photos.

309
00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:00.829
> P8: So is there. It is screen.

310
00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:02.590
Tyler: Yay

311
00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:07.730
Tyler: so hopefully if you click that one.

312
00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.420
> P8: It says, start broadcast, perfect.

313
00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:37.600
Jamie: Yeah, so like that.

314
00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:43.650
Tyler: Yay, I can see your screen now.

315
00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:45.410
> P8: Oh, thank God!

316
00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:55.269
Tyler: Thanks so much for working through that. I know that's really frustrating, and it's hard. It's hard for us to help when we can't see exactly what you're what screen you're on.

317
00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:59.490
> P8: Goodness, you guys are wonderful. I wouldn't be able to do your job.

318
00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:06.099
Tyler: Oh, well, you're wonderful for sticking through this for us, so we really appreciate it. Thank you.

319
00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:11.519
Jamie: Going through this. We know it's a frustrating thing, and Zoom doesn't always play nice with this.

320
00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:14.406
> P8: This is not my job.

321
00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:18.247
> P8: You guys feel bad. I'm retired.

322
00:24:21.535 --> 00:24:22.600
Tyler: Oh, well.

323
00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:23.250
> P8: That's.

324
00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:31.729
Tyler: Awesome. So from here, Jamie, I'm not really sure. Actually should this.

325
00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:36.219
Tyler: Does he need to do anything to get the screen broadcasting to

326
00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:38.820
Tyler: like, dismiss.

327
00:24:41.714 --> 00:24:51.019
Jamie: I think he just needs to swipe up with one finger, and that should take him back to like his home screen, or whatever else is open.

328
00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:54.489
Jamie: So try, try just swiping up from the bottom.

329
00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:07.990
> P8: I got nothing.

330
00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:10.310
Jamie: Okay.

331
00:25:13.053 --> 00:25:16.579
Jamie: are you? Are you swiping left and right, or up and down.

332
00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:18.710
> P8: Up, and from bottom up.

333
00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:20.799
Jamie: Really, okay.

334
00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:21.920
Jamie: one. Sec.

335
00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:31.759
> P8: Sorry I wasn't paying attention I was assuming it's swipe up, is is it supposed to be swipe up, or another.

336
00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:37.929
Jamie: Yeah, yeah, but I always thought it was if you swipe up from the very bottom of the screen.

337
00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:39.930
> P8: Yeah.

338
00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:41.380
> P8: so.

339
00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:47.929
Jamie: But that doesn't seem to be working for you. So I'm gonna look things up. Thanks, Jamie. One second.

340
00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:57.350
Tyler: Let's take a moment also, while Jamie's doing that, [P8]. We'll just take a breather from like the troubleshooting, and we'll I'll tell you a little bit more about what we're looking at today, or what we're gonna like.

341
00:25:57.970 --> 00:25:58.350
> P8: Okay.

342
00:25:58.612 --> 00:26:00.190
Tyler: The tool we're going to use?

343
00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:02.140
Tyler: So

344
00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:07.338
Tyler: we're gonna in a minute. We're gonna get you set up on the website,

345
00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:21.230
Tyler: which might take a little bit more patience, and then hopefully, we'll go. We'll be smooth sailing from there. And we're going to be on va.gov on this test version of va.gov and we're going to be using a tool called, ask Va

346
00:26:21.659 --> 00:26:27.239
Tyler: so ask. Va is a way for veterans to contact the Va online. If they have a question.

347
00:26:29.063 --> 00:26:45.980
Tyler: it's some. It's something that you could use. For example, you could go and contact the Va. About a question that you had about your benefits or something. It's also something that your wife could use. She might submit a question on behalf of you. And ask a question for you.

348
00:26:46.563 --> 00:27:05.639
Tyler: Or she could ask a question, maybe about her own eligibility for benefits, for example? Because she's the spouse. So it, it works similar to a contact form. So there's going to be some questions that we're going to go through together, and we're gonna pretend, like, you're asking the Va a question about

349
00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:10.519
Tyler: your health care. Okay? And I can remind you of that scenario whenever you need.

350
00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:11.710
> P8: Yeah.

351
00:27:12.378 --> 00:27:15.509
Tyler: So do you have any questions about? Ask? Va.

352
00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:17.850
> P8: No, I

353
00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:20.810
> P8: I guess I've seen stuff

354
00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:22.790
> P8: emails about

355
00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:24.459
> P8: about and about

356
00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:27.979
> P8: veterans being encouraged to use

357
00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:30.789
> P8: the the website

358
00:27:30.910 --> 00:27:33.690
> P8: for contacting. Okay.

359
00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:37.820
Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

360
00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:43.700
> P8: Yeah. So we do it. The hard way we do a phone call, I get frustrated because

361
00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:47.969
> P8: we got transferred, you know, like half dozen times, or

362
00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:50.030
> P8: we wait an hour.

363
00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:51.800
Tyler: Right? Yeah, no, that's.

364
00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:52.709
> P8: Phone, the phone call.

365
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:53.400
Tyler: Seems.

366
00:27:54.010 --> 00:27:54.740
> P8: Yeah.

367
00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:56.679
Tyler: You go ahead.

368
00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:58.799
> P8: Yeah. So the phone calls

369
00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:08.729
> P8: it you. I I don't think it's ever been good with phone calls already. It's kind of like historical. You get passed on for one.

370
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:10.840
> P8: one person to the next.

371
00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:11.820
Tyler: Right.

372
00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:18.980
> P8: It's like. Fortunately, it's like I keep saying, fortunately, but it's it's it's tough sometimes

373
00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:20.340
> P8: to have to wait.

374
00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:28.553
> P8: and I'm sure some of the other people are thinking, what are these guys getting impatient for? They're retired. They don't have anything else to do.

375
00:28:29.936 --> 00:28:31.670
Tyler: That's funny.

376
00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:34.550
> P8: It's yeah. So

377
00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:35.700
> P8: it's

378
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:38.680
> P8: I, actually, I prefer.

379
00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:42.110
> P8: although I don't do it. I prefer

380
00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:43.600
> P8: using

381
00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:47.449
> P8: using emails and the websites to get.

382
00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:48.660
Tyler: Okay.

383
00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:53.910
> P8: To get that questions answered. It may. It may take longer, but it's

384
00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:01.749
> P8: you. When you end. It's usually the the reply is, someone will contact you within 24 h.

385
00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:03.790
> P8: sometimes spare.

386
00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:08.550
> P8: and that that's easier. So you can hang up and wait.

387
00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:09.710
Tyler: Right, cool.

388
00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:11.000
> P8: Something else

389
00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:14.099
> P8: rather than walking around with a phone.

390
00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:17.060
> P8: you know, waiting, waiting for

391
00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:19.459
> P8: next person to come on.

392
00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:22.211
> P8: only took a transfer like, yeah.

393
00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:33.289
Tyler: Yeah, totally. That makes sense. So you might have to like, do a little bit more work on upfront. But then you don't have to sit on the phone waiting, or kind of.

394
00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:34.330
> P8: Yeah, yeah.

395
00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:36.529
Tyler: Be on their timeline that makes sense.

396
00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:37.960
> P8: Yeah waning.

397
00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:45.179
> P8: So again, even if we're retired, and wife is kind of like retired, although she's much younger than I am.

398
00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:48.809
> P8: It's waiting. Patience is

399
00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:52.009
> P8: something we don't have. Unfortunately.

400
00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:56.999
Tyler: Yeah, I mean, I get that. I don't know how many of us are patient anymore. Because

401
00:29:57.737 --> 00:30:01.749
Tyler: once, you know, things can be more efficient. It's a little frustrating when they're not.

402
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:02.570
> P8: Yeah.

403
00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:03.280
Tyler: Yeah, yeah.

404
00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:05.050
> P8: Yeah. So

405
00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:09.290
> P8: the the joke that's not funny is

406
00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:14.540
> P8: Alexandria is the main healthcare

407
00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:16.700
> P8: provider in the area.

408
00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.269
> P8: And then you got

409
00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:20.070
> P8: Cbocs

410
00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:22.280
> P8: community base.

411
00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:23.600
Tyler: Yeah, me, neither.

412
00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:23.960
> P8: For the next.

413
00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:24.970
Tyler: Organization.

414
00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:26.940
> P8: Clinics. Okay.

415
00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:27.919
Tyler: Phonics got it.

416
00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:29.939
> P8: So we go to a clinic.

417
00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:33.090
> P8: When we when I want to talk to somebody at the clinic.

418
00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:34.770
> P8: the call goes

419
00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:36.699
> P8: to Alexandria.

420
00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:38.170
> P8: I'll

421
00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:42.950
> P8: they, from from what they explained to me, is because of

422
00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:45.700
> P8: missed calls and lost calls.

423
00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:47.609
> P8: They want rocket or poof

424
00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:50.149
> P8: who's calling, and when they call

425
00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:52.749
> P8: so my call, my call.

426
00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:58.690
> P8: Actually, I call a number. That's the clinic where the call goes to

427
00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:00.429
> P8: the main hospital.

428
00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:02.470
> P8: Then they transfer me back

429
00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:05.020
> P8: to the clinic.

430
00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:08.590
> P8: and there have been times.

431
00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:14.089
> P8: Oh, I want it so. The funny, the funny stuff I got! Funny, but not so funny.

432
00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:17.799
> P8: I I'm I have mild depression.

433
00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:22.330
> P8: And for I had some stressors. So I got worse, and I wanted to

434
00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:24.861
> P8: talk to a therapist.

435
00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:30.789
> P8: So I I call, and I I get transferred to someone who's not a therapist.

436
00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:31.680
Tyler: Hmm.

437
00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:33.430
> P8: They got a chance. They got a

438
00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:37.190
> P8: take my name, and I said, they said, they'll send a message to them.

439
00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:41.140
> P8: So yeah, that's the that's the tough part, and it's like if we.

440
00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:41.780
Tyler: Yeah.

441
00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:43.660
> P8: Use the emails.

442
00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:45.810
> P8: Yeah, would be so much better.

443
00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:47.120
Tyler: Right?

444
00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:59.359
Tyler: Yeah. So that bouncing around and having your question sent to the wrong people, thing is a particular like frustration with the phone, which makes sense, especially when you're trying to get something like a therapist.

445
00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:00.150
> P8: Yeah.

446
00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:03.268
Tyler: And you're like, Can you please just make this work.

447
00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:05.120
> P8: Yeah, yeah.

448
00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:06.020
Tyler: Totally.

449
00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:37.250
Tyler: Well, I I love hearing that background because it's really helpful for us to have a better idea of what makes people want to, you know, contact the Va over the phone, or or go into a Va or use maybe this tool that we're looking at today. So that's really helpful. [P8]! While while we were chatting, Jamie did some some digging, and we think we might know how to get you back to the home screen, and then from there we can probably open up. I think you said you use safari, so should we give that a go.

450
00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:38.720
> P8: Okay.

451
00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:39.650
Tyler: Okay, I.

452
00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:43.809
> P8: Sorry the other way that I we've never tried.

453
00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:46.100
> P8: Is with with voiceover.

454
00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:48.839
> P8: if we're gonna open safari

455
00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:52.570
> P8: with, I think I can open it with voice over.

456
00:32:53.070 --> 00:33:18.209
Tyler: Yeah, okay, we can try that. We're a little bit unsure if we're currently on a screen that says like, it's basically letting us know that your screen is being shared. And we're not totally sure if you need to like, get out of this screen before you can do your next task, or you can just go straight to safari. But why don't we give that a try? Do you want to try using voice over and getting to safari?

457
00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:18.870
> P8: Yeah.

458
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:19.500
Tyler: Okay.

459
00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:22.059
> P8: Siri. Open safari.

460
00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:27.510
> P8: No.

461
00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:39.689
Tyler: Yeah, so it's not opening. And I think it might be because we're stuck on this like sort of middle interim page. Should we try. Maybe.

462
00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:43.890
Tyler: Let's see, I'm just reading through what

463
00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:46.369
Tyler: folks have been brainstorming.

464
00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:54.480
Tyler: What about just tapping kind of like in the middle of the ipad, or maybe a little bit higher up than the middle.

465
00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:01.999
Tyler: Okay, so I can see you're on the text now.

466
00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:10.829
Tyler: and if you like, select or like click, enter or anything.

467
00:34:11.179 --> 00:34:12.139
Tyler: Now.

468
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.670
Tyler: okay, let's not click that. Oh.

469
00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:21.940
Tyler: okay.

470
00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:29.050
Tyler: So I think we accidentally, and that's my fault. We stopped screen sharing.

471
00:34:29.969 --> 00:34:30.719
> P8: Oh!

472
00:34:31.659 --> 00:34:38.655
Tyler: That's my fault, because it's in the middle of the screen. So it was very easy to to end up doing that.

473
00:34:40.819 --> 00:34:45.009
Tyler: Do you want to try and do that? To set up the screen share again?

474
00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:51.649
Tyler: Maybe it'll be a little bit easier this time around. We'll have to find that menu

475
00:34:54.209 --> 00:34:55.689
Tyler: for sharing content.

476
00:34:57.100 --> 00:34:59.300
> P8: It says, start broadcast within.

477
00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:01.649
Tyler: Yeah, yeah, let's click on that.

478
00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:13.631
Tyler: Okay, perfect. So now we're back to where we were, which is great. We're still

479
00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:20.060
Tyler: So why don't we try clicking kind of just like towards the bottom of the screen.

480
00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:22.720
Tyler: like quite far, low.

481
00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:30.400
> P8: Okay, that's good.

482
00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:32.500
Tyler: Not that one? Yeah. Okay.

483
00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:36.219
Tyler: So we're kind of stuck here. What if you go ahead, Jamie?

484
00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:43.449
Jamie: I could you try something for me? If you love God now I have to find it again.

485
00:35:44.890 --> 00:35:46.099
Jamie: There you go.

486
00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:51.250
Jamie: If you drag one finger from the bottom of the screen.

487
00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:54.240
Jamie: hear 2 tones.

488
00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:56.600
Jamie: and then lift your finger.

489
00:36:08.890 --> 00:36:09.680
> P8: So

490
00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:15.939
> P8: I don't know if you can hear the clicking.

491
00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:20.359
> P8: but that's 1 of I haven't figured out with the ipad.

492
00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:24.259
> P8: When you swipe one finger swipe up on the bottom.

493
00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:29.920
Jamie: Yeah, it says, drag one finger up from the bottom edge of the screen

494
00:36:30.010 --> 00:36:34.059
Jamie: until you hear 2 tones, and then lift your finger.

495
00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:39.479
Jamie: That's supposed to take you back to the home screen.

496
00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:40.140
> P8: Yeah.

497
00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:44.780
> P8: yeah, we're, it's like, we're stuck.

498
00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:50.579
Jamie: Yeah, yeah, exactly. It's like we're, oh, man, that's a bummer that that didn't work.

499
00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:52.040
Jamie: Great.

500
00:36:53.846 --> 00:36:55.310
Jamie: Trying to think of

501
00:36:56.330 --> 00:37:00.380
Jamie: another way to do it. If there's a way to do it.

502
00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:10.389
Tyler: I mean, I kind of noticed that when when you were going through that at 1 point that his focus moved to zoom like down below screen, broadcast.

503
00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:11.170
Jamie: Yeah.

504
00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:13.959
Tyler: I wonder if we need to like select that.

505
00:37:14.690 --> 00:37:17.020
Jamie: Yeah, why not? Yeah, if you if you

506
00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:21.949
Jamie: but swipe right a couple of times and or once or twice.

507
00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:23.689
Jamie: and in theory.

508
00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:27.420
Jamie: yeah, no, it's not letting him.

509
00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:31.119
Jamie: It's not putting it in focus. You see.

510
00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:35.780
Tyler: Yeah, it's not now. But for a second it was in focus. I wonder if

511
00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:38.639
Tyler: I wonder if it's from doing what you did

512
00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:39.990
Tyler: just now.

513
00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:42.712
Tyler: What was it again? It was like?

514
00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:48.870
Tyler: it was driving one finger up.

515
00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:50.780
Jamie: One finger up from the bottom.

516
00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:52.100
> P8: Yeah.

517
00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:56.800
> P8: the last time I I just didn't. Did we have any change in the screen?

518
00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:00.539
Tyler: There's no change now.

519
00:38:01.330 --> 00:38:10.359
Tyler: But when you did that thing that Jamie described, your focus shifted from the text, it's on right now to zoom.

520
00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:15.699
Tyler: So we're wondering if maybe selecting Zoom would help us get out of this weird

521
00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:17.080
Tyler: middle page.

522
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:18.540
> P8: Yeah.

523
00:38:43.350 --> 00:38:50.789
Tyler: Jamie, should we go back to like just went shit like switching between apps and trying to get to safari.

524
00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:54.964
Jamie: That's not a terrible idea. Maybe that'll work.

525
00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:57.610
Jamie: let's see, let's see.

526
00:38:57.710 --> 00:39:02.149
Jamie: So this is the same thing where you drag one finger up

527
00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:07.050
Jamie: from the bottom of the screen, and this time you hear 3 tones.

528
00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:11.480
Jamie: and then you lift your finger, and that takes you to the app switcher.

529
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.300
> P8: Yeah, that's what I've been trying to do. Actually.

530
00:39:17.310 --> 00:39:18.240
Jamie: Okay.

531
00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:22.010
> P8: And it's okay. Stuff on this page. And.

532
00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:24.290
Jamie: Yeah. Oh.

533
00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:27.060
Jamie: trying to figure it out.

534
00:39:31.930 --> 00:39:32.939
> P8: And it's not.

535
00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:39.410
Tyler: Very. It's very strange.

536
00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:44.670
Jamie: Yeah, it is strange. And and we see what's happening on our end. We're sorry. It's so frustrating.

537
00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:46.630
> P8: It says.

538
00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:51.860
Tyler: What does it say?

539
00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:56.050
> P8: It's I heard it said, look for App Switcher.

540
00:39:57.250 --> 00:39:58.260
> P8: so

541
00:39:58.430 --> 00:39:59.190
> P8: they'll

542
00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:01.329
> P8: one finger swipe up

543
00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:03.210
> P8: is walking.

544
00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:05.789
> P8: But somehow the app switcher

545
00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:09.890
> P8: is not working. For whatever reason.

546
00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:16.670
Jamie: Yeah, it's it's almost like this screen is prohibiting it from working.

547
00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:18.270
> P8: Yeah, yeah.

548
00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:20.090
Jamie: And I I

549
00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:22.880
Jamie: feel terrible, but I don't know why.

550
00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:28.990
Tyler: Well.

551
00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:33.000
Tyler: [P8], how are we doing on like patients

552
00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:34.660
Tyler: levels right now?

553
00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:38.580
> P8: I'm still awake and not going crazy.

554
00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:39.500
Tyler: Okay.

555
00:40:40.890 --> 00:40:46.093
Tyler: because we can keep trying to do this. And I'm totally fine with doing that.

556
00:40:47.240 --> 00:41:00.550
Tyler: we can also just decide not to to test the website. And we can have more of a conversation like we were just having before about the ways you contact the Va things that make it more difficult or easy for you.

557
00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:05.579
Tyler: and and just skip testing the tool. Do you have a preference.

558
00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:08.190
> P8: Q. And a.

559
00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:09.530
Tyler: Q. And a.

560
00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:10.520
> P8: Yeah.

561
00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:11.190
Tyler: Okay.

562
00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:11.989
> P8: Let's do that.

563
00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:16.549
> P8: I think, yeah, because we haven't got much time left, do we.

564
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:22.379
Tyler: Right? Yeah, we have about 25 min. So we can. Yeah, let's have a chat.

565
00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:23.260
> P8: Yeah.

566
00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:23.960
Tyler: Okay.

567
00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:30.493
Tyler: sounds good. Well, thank you, Jamie. So much for the help. And [P8], so much for your patience.

568
00:41:31.090 --> 00:41:39.069
Tyler: obviously, we've hit a roadblock. That kind of none of us really understand. So it's nobody's fault, but it is frustrating.

569
00:41:42.021 --> 00:41:48.880
Tyler: [P8], we were just talking about when you contact the Va over the phone. And some of the like frustration comes from

570
00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:56.849
Tyler: basically being bounced around. I'm curious like, if you could imagine

571
00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.169
Tyler: it working really well, what? What exactly would that look like over the phone.

572
00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:13.630
> P8: So there are like when I call the clinic. There are recordings that's and one of them

573
00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:16.049
> P8: one of the recordings, the one I.

574
00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:17.480
> P8: No one I

575
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:18.820
> P8: chose

576
00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:22.319
> P8: was contact, mental health.

577
00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:23.490
> P8: person.

578
00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:25.420
> P8: and then it went.

579
00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:31.320
> P8: I forget when. When. So if if I if I

580
00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:33.370
> P8: select that

581
00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:35.650
> P8: selection.

582
00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:38.330
> P8: it's what I would expect is

583
00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:40.659
> P8: to talk to someone.

584
00:42:42.355 --> 00:42:43.130
> P8: Either.

585
00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:45.410
> P8: I don't expect to talk to him

586
00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:47.270
> P8: a therapist.

587
00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:52.659
> P8: Expect them to answer the phone with someone in their office

588
00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:57.620
> P8: to answer the phone, and where I can set up an appointment.

589
00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:01.510
> P8: That would be ideal.

590
00:43:01.690 --> 00:43:02.450
Tyler: Yeah.

591
00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:08.470
Tyler: And remind me, remind me what it said. It said something like contact, mental health, or something like that.

592
00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:18.360
> P8: Yeah, yeah, it's like, who do you want to speak to? And you know, it's like farm. The the selection usually goes pharmacy, primary care provider

593
00:43:18.836 --> 00:43:21.329
> P8: and then, now they have mental health.

594
00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:23.270
> P8: got it. So what?

595
00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:26.540
> P8: So doesn't matter who I'm calling?

596
00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:27.770
> P8: It's so

597
00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:30.120
> P8: I want I wanted to go.

598
00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:32.230
> P8: I want to talk to a person.

599
00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:36.179
> P8: the least amount of people

600
00:43:36.750 --> 00:43:39.200
> P8: to get an appointment with whoever

601
00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:41.879
> P8: or to get a question answered.

602
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:48.769
> P8: So it's what's interesting. It's like, I don't know what it's like at other

603
00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:53.840
> P8: in other areas. But I want to talk to when I have a question for the pharmacist.

604
00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:56.690
> P8: The call goes to pharmacy.

605
00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:00.750
> P8: and then it usually our tech answers the phone.

606
00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:04.789
> P8: and when I ask the question they go. Sorry. Wait! And they

607
00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:09.289
> P8: I'm on hold for a little while, and then I get to talk to the pharmacist.

608
00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:11.560
> P8: That's that's ideal.

609
00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:13.440
> P8: But with

610
00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:15.200
> P8: with the other

611
00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:18.639
> P8: like met with with a therapist or with

612
00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:24.059
> P8: primary care, whether it's a nurse, practitioner, or a doctor. It usually.

613
00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:29.020
> P8: you know, talk to 2 or 3 people before an appointment can be made.

614
00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:30.230
Tyler: Right?

615
00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:35.189
Tyler: So it's obviously like a big source of the frustration comes from

616
00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:45.389
Tyler: having to go through essentially hoops. So one person and then, okay, I'm still not at the right person. Next person. All of that kind of routing around is really frustrating.

617
00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:45.870
> P8: Yeah.

618
00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:47.899
Tyler: And maybe part of the reason.

619
00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:54.879
Tyler: When I asked you your ideal scenario, you kind of described. Okay? And then I could choose mental health

620
00:44:54.910 --> 00:44:57.430
Tyler: and that option

621
00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:01.700
Tyler: fit what you needed. So it was like, Okay, I can more directly

622
00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:14.270
Tyler: just start in the right place. Which is really helpful. That's really interesting to think about. Especially, I'll tell you a little bit more about ask Va, so when you start asking a question online.

623
00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:29.179
Tyler: the 1st question is for you to choose a category. So it says, what category best describes your question. It's similar right to the phone menu that you were just describing. So you might choose things like

624
00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:33.923
Tyler: disability, compensation, healthcare debt

625
00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:41.100
Tyler: life insurance things like that. And you'll have to go through that those options, and you'll choose one.

626
00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:48.399
Tyler: that you know. That sounds like it's a familiar thing for you. What? What's your kind of

627
00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:55.680
Tyler: What do you worry about when I describe to you that page or that list of options.

628
00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:58.569
Tyler: What do you worry about not working well.

629
00:45:59.570 --> 00:46:02.210
> P8: If there's a list of options.

630
00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:05.029
> P8: How how do I

631
00:46:05.210 --> 00:46:12.710
> P8: check the right? Usually the term I recall, I'm recalling is check, written radio button.

632
00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:16.669
> P8: How do I know I'm checking the right one?

633
00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:19.729
> P8: Yeah. So for

634
00:46:21.110 --> 00:46:25.919
> P8: for the few, just a small percentage of us who are totally.

635
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.739
> P8: I call it, totally blind, I cannot read.

636
00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:33.260
> P8: So it's like, I gotta depend on my hearing

637
00:46:33.690 --> 00:46:34.819
> P8: on

638
00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:39.449
> P8: Which selection should I check.

639
00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:42.130
> P8: So that becomes

640
00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:45.420
> P8: for for me personally, that's the biggest

641
00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:49.839
> P8: Call it hindrance frustration.

642
00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:51.330
> P8: It's like.

643
00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:56.399
> P8: you know, you wanna you wanna list a lot of things.

644
00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:57.840
> P8: but yet

645
00:46:58.170 --> 00:46:59.580
> P8: that becomes

646
00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:01.480
> P8: overwhelming

647
00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:06.339
> P8: for the 41. Yeah, if you have a dozen items to choose from.

648
00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:08.219
> P8: and I'm sure

649
00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:16.449
> P8: people like yourself have figured out. When you when you gotta go through a list of you gotta check one. Pick one.

650
00:47:17.350 --> 00:47:19.720
> P8: If if there's more than 6

651
00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:24.950
> P8: you may lose the the caller like my

652
00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:28.990
> P8: I if I see more than 6, it's like, Oh, well, wife.

653
00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:31.533
> P8: please, it's pretty, please.

654
00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:34.830
> P8: but I think that that's

655
00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:37.159
> P8: but for me. That's that's fun.

656
00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:44.489
> P8: What I find is a hindrance for me to use

657
00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:46.216
> P8: the feature

658
00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:48.459
> P8: I I don't have.

659
00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:52.649
> P8: I'm thinking, maybe on a way to avoid that is

660
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:57.090
> P8: you. You go. You select one out of 4,

661
00:47:57.110 --> 00:48:00.639
> P8: and the next one is like from the one you selected.

662
00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:02.460
> P8: There are 6 more

663
00:48:03.090 --> 00:48:04.469
> P8: that you can choose.

664
00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:07.619
> P8: Pick one from the next 6,

665
00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:09.040
> P8: and it

666
00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:11.559
> P8: I I think, if you go through

667
00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:17.900
> P8: for me, anyway, I could go to go through 2 of those elections.

668
00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:19.680
> P8: So.

669
00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:21.010
Tyler: Right.

670
00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:30.950
> P8: Yeah, remembering 4, remembering 4 go to the 1st one, and it's like when when I get to the 4, th I still remember what the 1st one was.

671
00:48:31.150 --> 00:48:32.040
Tyler: Yeah.

672
00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:35.559
> P8: Yeah, so and I don't know what. I'm sure

673
00:48:36.090 --> 00:48:38.789
> P8: from experience, you guys know how many

674
00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:42.819
> P8: selections people can go through and recall

675
00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:44.719
> P8: what the solutions are.

676
00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:50.080
Tyler: Yeah, you're bringing up such interesting points. So there's like this idea of.

677
00:48:50.290 --> 00:48:58.379
Tyler: you know, rather than giving me 20 options upfront. Give me a broader selection, and I'll start to narrow things down.

678
00:48:58.380 --> 00:48:58.700
> P8: You know.

679
00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:12.699
Tyler: As I go, and that's a little easier than trying to hold in your brain. Okay, I've just heard 15 options. Which one was it that I want to choose, making sure you choose the right one. That makes a lot of sense. And then you mentioned something.

680
00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:13.440
> P8: Yeah.

681
00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:14.309
> P8: you mentioned.

682
00:49:14.310 --> 00:49:27.689
Tyler: Something else that was interesting, which is, if if you do that. So if there's more selections, you know, question after question, you have to keep remembering what you previously said. Right? Yeah, that what you meant.

683
00:49:28.310 --> 00:49:29.030
> P8: Yeah.

684
00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:31.119
Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

685
00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:32.390
Tyler: So what

686
00:49:33.110 --> 00:49:44.480
Tyler: like, what helps in that scenario like, you're going, you have 4 options. And now you have 6 options, and you're trying to remember what you asked, what you chose before. Is there anything that helps you? Remember that like

687
00:49:44.870 --> 00:49:46.359
Tyler: that train of thought.

688
00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:52.640
> P8: So the your question is, what helps.

689
00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:59.349
Tyler: Yeah, what could help like, what could help in that scenario so like, you don't want to forget what you previously chose.

690
00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:02.620
> P8: Oh, that's forget it. It's like I'm old.

691
00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:07.309
> P8: If everything is logically set up.

692
00:50:08.490 --> 00:50:14.950
> P8: I really don't have to remember what I did earlier. So say, you got, say, you got 3 sets.

693
00:50:15.110 --> 00:50:17.990
> P8: and each set gets a little more detail.

694
00:50:18.370 --> 00:50:20.420
> P8: Yeah, it's like.

695
00:50:21.210 --> 00:50:21.890
> P8: huh!

696
00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:25.889
> P8: I'll I'll try to remember.

697
00:50:26.010 --> 00:50:30.380
> P8: I'll ask myself what was the 1st one, or what was the second one.

698
00:50:30.590 --> 00:50:32.649
> P8: When the 3rd selections.

699
00:50:33.250 --> 00:50:35.229
> P8: There's nothing there that

700
00:50:35.370 --> 00:50:37.050
> P8: that applies to me.

701
00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:44.270
> P8: So if, if the say, like the 3rd set of selections, all of those items.

702
00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:50.519
> P8: you know, I can pick one of them that I don't need to remember what the one before that was.

703
00:50:51.565 --> 00:50:52.420
Tyler: Yeah.

704
00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:57.529
> P8: Yeah. So I I'm not what I recall the last time I went to blind, rehab

705
00:50:57.770 --> 00:51:03.940
> P8: the psychologist did the I guess it's a cognition cognitive testing.

706
00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:06.360
> P8: I'm going to read you 6,

707
00:51:06.650 --> 00:51:07.700
> P8: or it's

708
00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:11.260
> P8: and you gotta read. You gotta tell me what those 6 words were.

709
00:51:12.410 --> 00:51:13.910
> P8: and

710
00:51:14.050 --> 00:51:14.910
> P8: it's

711
00:51:15.450 --> 00:51:16.450
> P8: when

712
00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:21.109
> P8: I surprised myself when I did 5 out of 6,

713
00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:24.570
> P8: and with little prompting I got the 6th one.

714
00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:25.970
> P8: But

715
00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:32.690
> P8: you know so and that's why I mentioned stuff like 4, and there are others who can do a whole lot more than I can.

716
00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:35.090
> P8: But even when I was younger

717
00:51:35.470 --> 00:51:37.329
> P8: I always had a problem

718
00:51:37.950 --> 00:51:40.780
> P8: trying to remember all the selections.

719
00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:41.540
Tyler: Right.

720
00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:43.990
> P8: Oh, so the like. The other one

721
00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:45.280
> P8: that

722
00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:50.630
> P8: that I have fun with is when they ask you to do

723
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:53.320
> P8: satisfaction surveys.

724
00:51:54.790 --> 00:51:56.710
> P8: or, you know, rate something.

725
00:51:56.810 --> 00:51:57.919
> P8: and they go.

726
00:51:58.870 --> 00:52:00.039
> P8: you know, like

727
00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:05.692
> P8: usually when in school, we went A, BCDF,

728
00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:10.470
> P8: and that was pretty simple. Now, is is it

729
00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:15.429
> P8: excellent. You know, good

730
00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:18.900
> P8: average fare.

731
00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:22.190
> P8: And then I got about 6 elections.

732
00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:24.569
> P8: and it's like holy smokes.

733
00:52:25.550 --> 00:52:26.110
Tyler: Nothing.

734
00:52:26.110 --> 00:52:30.180
> P8: Everything was excellent, so why don't I just pick everything was good.

735
00:52:30.668 --> 00:52:35.550
Tyler: Right? Yeah, it's hard to have that level of specificity.

736
00:52:35.860 --> 00:52:36.620
> P8: Yeah.

737
00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:48.247
Tyler: Yeah, that's that's all really interesting. It's that's very helpful. When we think about the beginning of our form, because people do need to make a choice between a lot of selections.

738
00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:49.120
> P8: And I can be.

739
00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:59.910
Tyler: A lot to hold in your brain, especially when you're hearing it out loud, like you're saying so. That's super helpful. There's another part of the form where you have to search

740
00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:08.249
Tyler: for your health facility. So there's a search bar, and you can put in your city or your postal code.

741
00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:09.370
> P8: Off.

742
00:53:09.370 --> 00:53:11.010
Tyler: And then you can click search.

743
00:53:11.370 --> 00:53:13.009
Tyler: Yeah, I'm curious, like.

744
00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:20.769
Tyler: what's your experience of doing things like that? Online, since you've went blind and you've started using voice over and and things like that.

745
00:53:23.817 --> 00:53:30.272
> P8: Usually. That's when I give it to my wife. But if I have absolutely nothing else to, I'm feeling really good.

746
00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:31.350
Tyler: Yeah.

747
00:53:31.350 --> 00:53:37.949
> P8: I'll I'll go to that. Actually, I've been kind of doing it recently on Facebook, like on Facebook. And

748
00:53:38.706 --> 00:53:43.910
> P8: there was another app that I use, but going going to the search and actually

749
00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:47.969
> P8: typing. So for me, my, my problem is

750
00:53:48.270 --> 00:53:55.699
> P8: using an external keyboard. And usually I use the phone a lot. I use the phone more than I do. The ipad.

751
00:53:57.340 --> 00:53:58.270
> P8: It's

752
00:53:58.460 --> 00:54:02.089
> P8: I use the external keyboard on the phone, too.

753
00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:05.560
> P8: So it's it's easier for me.

754
00:54:06.170 --> 00:54:08.109
> P8: I don't have to hunt and pack.

755
00:54:08.450 --> 00:54:09.220
Tyler: Okay.

756
00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:10.940
> P8: On an external keyboard

757
00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:12.660
> P8: and with

758
00:54:13.584 --> 00:54:16.855
> P8: if I don't occasionally, I'll

759
00:54:19.070 --> 00:54:25.219
> P8: when I gotta respond to text messages like, you know, when doctors are

760
00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:29.389
> P8: leaving a message or sending a message to confirm an appointment.

761
00:54:29.550 --> 00:54:34.639
> P8: They asked for a response, and it's like, Why

762
00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:45.130
> P8: 11? And because of my enunciation I I cannot use dictation. Y. 11 becomes WHY.

763
00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:46.270
> P8: 11.

764
00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:52.870
> P8: So I that's why I gotta use a keyboard. And it's like, only recently.

765
00:54:52.910 --> 00:54:55.959
> P8: I started using the keyboard on the phone.

766
00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:57.820
> P8: But it's it's the same.

767
00:54:58.060 --> 00:54:59.780
> P8: you know, Hunt, and

768
00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:04.660
> P8: I gotta search for I I kind of know where the YI know where the Y is.

769
00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:08.660
> P8: you know, based on using a keyboard.

770
00:55:09.350 --> 00:55:12.130
> P8: But actually finding it on the phone.

771
00:55:12.370 --> 00:55:13.740
> P8: It's like

772
00:55:14.070 --> 00:55:17.610
> P8: that takes 3 or 4 touches before I can find the wire.

773
00:55:17.610 --> 00:55:18.480
Tyler: Right and.

774
00:55:18.830 --> 00:55:22.520
> P8: And then it's a few more touches to find the

775
00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:25.270
> P8: the number

776
00:55:25.710 --> 00:55:27.739
> P8: to get to the number pad

777
00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:29.870
> P8: the number of keys.

778
00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:34.669
> P8: and then it's like couple more times to find a 1.

779
00:55:35.310 --> 00:55:42.059
> P8: So, but if it's only 3 like that, it's like I'll go through the trouble, otherwise I'll pull take out my

780
00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:46.419
> P8: keyboard external keyboard. I'll actually type it in

781
00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:48.170
> P8: so.

782
00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:54.129
> P8: And I I think now it's like I'm doing less before I was doing a lot more.

783
00:55:54.310 --> 00:55:57.579
> P8: and like my keyboard, was always on.

784
00:55:58.330 --> 00:56:00.599
> P8: And so, when I had to

785
00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:03.909
> P8: type in like doing doing a search.

786
00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:08.009
> P8: the keyboard was always there, so I could do it quickly.

787
00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:10.210
> P8: And usually

788
00:56:10.530 --> 00:56:13.890
> P8: I you know, most of the time I got it right.

789
00:56:14.070 --> 00:56:15.610
> P8: and it had fallen

790
00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:16.980
> P8: like doing

791
00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:23.260
> P8: like find a clinic in your area. I could find it.

792
00:56:23.740 --> 00:56:24.480
Tyler: Okay.

793
00:56:25.870 --> 00:56:33.949
Tyler: yeah. So it's like, yeah, that was really interesting to just kind of hear the frustration. Because obviously with a search field, you're gonna have to put in

794
00:56:33.970 --> 00:56:37.629
Tyler: text somehow. And you're saying, like, the dictation

795
00:56:37.710 --> 00:56:52.079
Tyler: doesn't work super. Well. And it's it's interesting. I have the transcript up on my computer right now, and I could see as you were, as you were saying, why, 11, and you were describing the way it would come up. That's exactly how it came up on the Transcript. So.

796
00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:52.650
> P8: Yeah.

797
00:56:52.650 --> 00:56:57.709
Tyler: Obviously the dictation could be really frustrating for stuff like that. But the keyboard

798
00:56:57.740 --> 00:57:09.700
Tyler: is still almost new to you to use it in this way. So that makes sense. So it's a little bit easier, maybe to. Is it easier to navigate rather than have to input, information.

799
00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:12.949
> P8: Where do you say navigate.

800
00:57:13.310 --> 00:57:13.875
Tyler: Like

801
00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:16.867
> P8: Like the other one is is

802
00:57:20.010 --> 00:57:27.430
> P8: Picking a selection, a dropbox! Why not? It's not a dropbox, I can. I can't remember the terms

803
00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:32.320
> P8: like you, you click on a field, and the the whole list.

804
00:57:32.610 --> 00:57:35.379
> P8: whole list of names or numbers

805
00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:36.729
> P8: come down.

806
00:57:37.100 --> 00:57:37.700
> P8: That

807
00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:39.880
> P8: that one

808
00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:45.130
> P8: I'm trying to think I've I think I've tried it like

809
00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:49.599
> P8: few times like we. We live in Louisiana.

810
00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:49.920
Tyler: Okay.

811
00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:51.319
> P8: So when you ask

812
00:57:52.153 --> 00:57:54.269
> P8: and as for the State.

813
00:57:54.510 --> 00:57:58.710
> P8: and you, you click on the state field and you got the drop-down list.

814
00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:00.560
> P8: All the States.

815
00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:02.550
> P8: and then it's

816
00:58:04.350 --> 00:58:08.259
> P8: I I couldn't. I can do it. I just don't like doing it.

817
00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:10.839
Tyler: Right cause. You have to go through the long list.

818
00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:12.300
> P8: Yeah. Yeah.

819
00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:16.630
> P8: So my, my preference is, if I gotta do it.

820
00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:20.810
> P8: Yeah, because because again, because of my enunciation.

821
00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:23.460
> P8: it's like, I'd rather use a keyboard.

822
00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:26.050
> P8: Yeah, unless.

823
00:58:26.250 --> 00:58:29.660
> P8: yeah, there are other apps that I use.

824
00:58:31.503 --> 00:58:34.409
> P8: I was thinking about it the other day.

825
00:58:34.660 --> 00:58:41.409
> P8: but it's like I got used to to it. I use you version for the Bible app I want wanna find

826
00:58:41.930 --> 00:58:44.610
> P8: saying, I wanna I wanna find

827
00:58:44.890 --> 00:58:48.790
> P8: Deuteronomy and I'm in revelation.

828
00:58:49.830 --> 00:58:51.647
> P8: That's a whole lot of books.

829
00:58:52.970 --> 00:59:05.639
> P8: a lot of swipes to get back to the beginning of the Bible, and that's what I was thinking, oh, sure, it'd be nice if they had us. Just a search field. Rather drop down this. But yeah.

830
00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:17.320
Tyler: That's a really good point, though, like we're talking about how search can be frustrating. And you're kind of saying, but sometimes I'd actually prefer search because the dropdown could be so long.

831
00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:18.470
> P8: Yeah.

832
00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:32.620
Tyler: What? What's what's the difference between? Like a dropdown where you have that list of options like you described or radio buttons like we were talking about earlier, where there's a list. That's on the page that you're going through.

833
00:59:32.730 --> 00:59:35.139
Tyler: Is there any difference in the experience for you?

834
00:59:36.170 --> 00:59:38.600
> P8: They're they're kind of kind of the same.

835
00:59:39.290 --> 00:59:41.719
> P8: It's just 1 1 of the things when there is

836
00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:54.949
> P8: Actually, it's it's it's my me and my my not being sometimes an active listener I get.

837
00:59:55.270 --> 00:59:59.479
> P8: I start getting like my attention span is really short.

838
00:59:59.490 --> 01:00:04.389
> P8: so I don't. I don't hear. I don't listen to the whole

839
01:00:04.450 --> 01:00:06.669
> P8: like with radio buttons, and

840
01:00:06.730 --> 01:00:15.159
> P8: it's asking for it. It has more than 4 words and a lot of times. I don't hear the last word.

841
01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:16.590
> P8: But

842
01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:18.670
> P8: yeah, as far as searching

843
01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:22.929
> P8: for me. I guess it's the same the radio button, or

844
01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:25.820
> P8: or on a dropdown list.

845
01:00:26.450 --> 01:00:27.980
> P8: Yeah, it.

846
01:00:28.910 --> 01:00:45.330
Tyler: That's really interesting, though I think that's a really helpful point that like when you're going through a list of options. And you're, you know tabbing. Or, however, you're getting through the list of options. You're hearing the beginning bit, and then you're going to the next one. You're hearing the beginning, and you're going to the next one, so you might not hear that full

847
01:00:45.370 --> 01:00:48.445
Tyler: string if it was like 8 words long.

848
01:00:48.830 --> 01:00:49.460
> P8: Yeah.

849
01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:51.329
Tyler: Which is helpful context.

850
01:00:51.590 --> 01:00:52.380
> P8: Yeah.

851
01:00:52.550 --> 01:00:56.460
> P8: So I'm not sure how many other people are as impatient as me.

852
01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:59.159
> P8: But it's like when there's a list.

853
01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:04.339
> P8: there's a tendency whether it's a down arrow, enter key or tab

854
01:01:04.470 --> 01:01:05.880
> P8: is is just

855
01:01:06.130 --> 01:01:10.160
> P8: going listening again to the 1st few words, and

856
01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:12.690
> P8: I'm pressing for the next one.

857
01:01:13.330 --> 01:01:15.130
> P8: and and then it's like

858
01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:19.340
> P8: I didn't hear the selection I wanted. I know I gotta go back.

859
01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:22.270
> P8: and that's that's when I use.

860
01:01:22.510 --> 01:01:24.420
> P8: If if I really

861
01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:28.069
> P8: need to get the information

862
01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:29.229
> P8: instead of

863
01:01:29.590 --> 01:01:32.200
> P8: pressing a key to go to the next one.

864
01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:33.470
> P8: I'll just

865
01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:35.969
> P8: do the 2 finger swipe.

866
01:01:35.970 --> 01:01:36.550
Tyler: Okay.

867
01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:40.549
> P8: And let Voiceover read each each selection.

868
01:01:41.110 --> 01:01:43.380
Tyler: Right? Okay, that makes sense.

869
01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:46.319
> P8: That's where I'm forced to listen.

870
01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:47.220
Tyler: Okay.

871
01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:49.370
> P8: To the entire race.

872
01:01:50.640 --> 01:02:01.169
Tyler: Yeah, it's it's a super interesting thing. Obviously, we all learn differently. And you haven't been blind for your whole life. So processing information just through

873
01:02:01.230 --> 01:02:04.905
Tyler: hearing. It is obviously an adjustment. So

874
01:02:05.770 --> 01:02:25.020
Tyler: it makes sense like you said you're not an active listener or a super active listener, but you probably are to an extent, because you're managing to do a lot of these things just by listening. So, yeah, it's really interesting. [P8], we have about like 4 min left. I had one kind of last question for you. If that's okay.

875
01:02:25.170 --> 01:02:25.820
> P8: Yeah.

876
01:02:26.206 --> 01:02:31.613
Tyler: One of the things in our form. That we've noticed is that people

877
01:02:32.470 --> 01:02:36.989
Tyler: we're struggling to understand like how much longer the form would be

878
01:02:37.375 --> 01:02:44.490
Tyler: have you? Have you had experiences of that with other forms? And is there anything that helps in those scenarios?

879
01:02:45.710 --> 01:02:52.389
> P8: No, because this doesn't matter if I know how many pages I left, it's still it's still a long document.

880
01:02:52.390 --> 01:02:53.170
Tyler: Okay.

881
01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:55.230
Tyler: Okay.

882
01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:57.259
> P8: But it it helps

883
01:02:57.430 --> 01:02:58.400
> P8: if

884
01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:06.559

885
01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:09.990

886
01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:14.860
> P8: When I was fighting to get from page 10 back to one.

887
01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:16.890

888
01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:20.640
> P8: page? You know, page 5 of 10.

889
01:03:21.850 --> 01:03:24.349

890
01:03:26.930 --> 01:03:29.110

891
01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:32.210

893
01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:41.389
> P8: say something like completed page 5 of 10.

894
01:03:42.450 --> 01:03:45.420
> P8: And then they said, this is page 6,

895
01:03:46.290 --> 01:03:48.660
> P8: yeah, something like that. If

896
01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:53.700

897
01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:56.739
> P8: digital documents like that.

898
01:03:56.740 --> 01:03:57.710
Tyler: Yeah, what's.

899
01:03:57.710 --> 01:04:04.120
> P8: But that would that would for me would would help a lot knowing how many more pages.

900
01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:09.780

901
01:04:10.050 --> 01:04:13.609

01:04:15.350 --> 01:04:18.040

916
01:04:55.730 --> 01:04:56.620
Tyler: Wow!

917
01:04:57.010 --> 01:05:01.980
> P8: When is this thing gonna be over? But I think the questions were numbered. So at least that helped.

918
01:05:02.290 --> 01:05:03.310
Tyler: Right.

919
01:05:03.310 --> 01:05:04.450

920
01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:09.399

921
01:05:10.070 --> 01:05:10.990

922
01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:12.600
Tyler: That's that's.

923
01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:15.430
> P8: How many questions there were so.

924
01:05:15.430 --> 01:05:16.040
Tyler: Huh!

925
01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:17.440
> P8: And it helped

926
01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:21.029
> P8: cause 85 questions is quite a bit.

927
01:05:22.510 --> 01:05:27.500
Tyler: Yeah, that's a lot. Especially, it's interesting. It's coming from the Bva.

928
01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:28.410
> P8: Yeah.

929
01:05:28.690 --> 01:05:29.710
> P8: yeah.

930
01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:30.850
Tyler: Do you find.

931
01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:31.650
> P8: Yeah.

932
01:05:31.650 --> 01:05:54.300
Tyler: That description was really really helpful for me. So you kind of said. You know, it's helpful to know at the end of the page that I've completed page 5. And then when I get to the next page for them to say, page 6, so that that kind of anchors you to each page, which is really useful, and I can see why it would be why, that would make sense. I'm curious like.

933
01:05:54.610 --> 01:05:58.960
Tyler: So there's 1 scenario like the Bva form where it just said

934
01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:07.239
Tyler: what question number you were on, but it didn't give you like a lot of information otherwise. And then there's another scenario where it says page 5,

935
01:06:07.690 --> 01:06:13.499
Tyler: and it doesn't tell you like page 5 of 10, it just says, page 5,

936
01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:21.260
Tyler: there's also like other ways of doing it. Like, where you say, okay, 20%. And then on the next page, it says, 30%.

937
01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:22.260
> P8: Oh, yeah.

938
01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:27.400
Tyler: What's what are your thoughts on those different ways of doing that? Is there one that's more helpful than another?

939
01:06:30.540 --> 01:06:31.970
> P8: I think it. It's

940
01:06:32.540 --> 01:06:34.729
> P8: it's it's the same where there's

941
01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:37.490
> P8: cause. Yeah. Now that you mentioned

942
01:06:37.570 --> 01:06:39.619
> P8: percent complete, I've done.

943
01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:43.250
> P8: I've done surveys or questioners, whatever.

944
01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:43.910
Tyler: What?

945
01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:47.509
> P8: Where it gave a percentage completion.

946
01:06:49.467 --> 01:06:51.230
> P8: And there's was.

947
01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:54.930
> P8: is is that 25%? Or is that all.

948
01:06:55.935 --> 01:06:56.940
Tyler: Right.

949
01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:58.079
> P8: But I think it.

950
01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:01.180
> P8: I would rather have it than not have it.

951
01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:01.930
Tyler: Yeah.

952
01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:03.920
Tyler: that makes sense.

953
01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:05.280
> P8: It helps a lot.

954
01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:07.710
> P8: Yeah. And it's

955
01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:13.660
> P8: for me. It's patience. It's almost done.

956
01:07:16.270 --> 01:07:45.243
Tyler: Yeah, that makes like a lot of sense that's actually really helpful, [P8], cause we've been thinking a lot about that, like, how do we explain to people how far along they are? And obviously everyone would love to say, You know, this is, gonna take you 2 more minutes, but it's hard for us to to estimate things like that. So we've been playing around with the idea of giving people a percentage. So we can say, you're 20% complete. And on the next page you might it might jump. You might be 45% complete.

957
01:07:45.530 --> 01:07:45.870
> P8: Yeah.

958
01:07:45.870 --> 01:07:55.230
Tyler: And we'll go through, and we'll know kind of, generally speaking, how long the form is going to be. And it sounds like that's something that would help you. And our other question has been.

959
01:07:55.370 --> 01:08:06.114
Tyler: should that be the 1st thing that your screen reader says. So you arrive on a new page. Should the screen reader say you know the question, should it say, you know,

960
01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:11.447
Tyler: who are you submitting this question for? Or should it say the percentage

961
01:08:12.070 --> 01:08:22.570
Tyler: And I'm curious like, it sounds to me like what you're saying is hearing the percentage 1st is useful because it gives you that that anchor point. Is that true?

962
01:08:23.890 --> 01:08:24.600
> P8: Yeah.

963
01:08:24.810 --> 01:08:25.460
Tyler: Yeah.

964
01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:26.670
> P8: I can

965
01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:30.549
> P8: percentage, or what is the other one? I kind of

966
01:08:31.790 --> 01:08:37.160
Tyler: The other option would be like the heading on the page. So you'd get to a new page, and it would say

967
01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:39.840
Tyler: the heading. So, whatever the question was.

968
01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:46.099
Tyler: So if you're going through a form. And the 3rd question is, it says, What's your address? Then you would.

969
01:08:46.329 --> 01:08:46.549
> P8: But.

970
01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:49.309
Tyler: Go onto that page, and it would say, What's your address?

971
01:08:50.290 --> 01:08:53.649
Tyler: Or it would say how far you are in the form.

972
01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:59.030
Tyler: I know it's a little hypothetical, but do you think one would be more useful than the other?

973
01:09:03.999 --> 01:09:05.479
> P8: wouldn't matter to me.

974
01:09:06.093 --> 01:09:07.319
Tyler: Yeah, honest.

975
01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:10.390
> P8: The the present is complete.

976
01:09:11.359 --> 01:09:14.329
> P8: would be to me more useful.

977
01:09:14.330 --> 01:09:16.289
Tyler: Okay, that makes sense.

978
01:09:17.229 --> 01:09:21.239
Tyler: I think that makes sense given like everything you just explained. So.

979
01:09:21.609 --> 01:09:28.409
> P8: Yeah. Cause like am I done yet? This is the whole. That's not my mentality, is, is it?

980
01:09:28.769 --> 01:09:34.119
> P8: You know? When is this gonna be done, how much more have to do.

981
01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:35.930
> P8: Cancel.

982
01:09:36.149 --> 01:09:39.950
> P8: What's the easiest way to answer those questions as

983
01:09:40.210 --> 01:09:42.430
> P8: the person doing it.

984
01:09:43.350 --> 01:09:44.109
Tyler: Right?

985
01:09:45.290 --> 01:09:46.300
Tyler: Yeah.

986
01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:48.833
Tyler: that makes. And that makes a lot of sense.

### Cool down

01:09:49.210 --> 01:10:04.909
Tyler: well, we've we've just actually went over our time. So just by a couple of minutes. So I really really appreciate you spending this time with us. I'm sorry it was so frustrating. I think maybe we should just all blame it on on zoom.

988
01:10:05.230 --> 01:10:05.740
> P8: Yeah.

989
01:10:06.054 --> 01:10:11.724
Tyler: And I really I appreciate you trying to work through it with us. Maybe in the future.

990
01:10:12.550 --> 01:10:31.897
Tyler: if if this comes up using a different device could help. If you feel like more comfortable on your phone, maybe that would help otherwise, like you can also even just ask perigee in like, can you help me test this before the research session cause? I'm not sure if it's working for me to share my screen.

991
01:10:32.220 --> 01:10:32.740
> P8: Yeah.

992
01:10:32.740 --> 01:10:37.270
Tyler: And we would all love to help you with that, because I know it's frustrating, and we

993
01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:43.850
Tyler: we love that you still show up, and you're still patient with us, and you still answer our questions.

994
01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:48.180
Tyler: Do you have any other questions for me before we wrap up.

995
01:10:48.710 --> 01:10:49.330
> P8: No.

996
01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:51.389
> P8: no, I'm glad.

997
01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:55.659
> P8: I'm glad Va. Is doing this to have to make things better.

998
01:10:55.880 --> 01:11:02.099
Tyler: Yeah, good me, too. And we really couldn't do it without your help. So I really appreciate it.

999
01:11:02.380 --> 01:11:03.070
> P8: Yeah.

1000
01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:04.899
> P8: Awesome. Very good.

1001
01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:06.549
Tyler: Well, thanks, [P8]. Have a good.

1002
01:11:06.550 --> 01:11:07.750
> P8: As bad.

1003
01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:08.930
> P8: Okay.

1004
01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:16.120
> P8: since I'm getting paid. I'm not, you know, volunteering, since I'm getting paid for doing this.

1005
01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:16.850
Tyler: Yeah.

1006
01:11:16.850 --> 01:11:17.940
> P8: That's fine!

1007
01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:18.450
Tyler: Oh, good!

1008
01:11:18.450 --> 01:11:18.880
> P8: Excellent.

1009
01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:25.878
Tyler: Well, when we started, you said you're hoping this isn't 1 of the frustrating ones, and so I hope I hope we ended at least on a good note.

1010
01:11:26.615 --> 01:11:27.110
> P8: But

1011
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:30.523
> P8: this is the second time where I couldn't.

1012
01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:31.640
Tyler: Very important.

1013
01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:34.080
> P8: More time trying to log in.

1014
01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:35.240
Tyler: Right.

1015
01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:45.389
> P8: And then the last time I'll and maybe I shouldn't say this. But I will, anyway. What a Ireland was the 1st or second the 1st time

1016
01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:49.590
> P8: we went through this whole we tried to log into a website.

1017
01:11:49.590 --> 01:11:50.240
Tyler: Yeah.

1018
01:11:50.590 --> 01:11:55.280
> P8: I was. I can't remember what was my ipad. I think it was with the ipad.

1019
01:11:55.450 --> 01:11:56.929
> P8: and then it's like

1020
01:11:57.100 --> 01:11:58.039
> P8: we talk.

1021
01:11:58.550 --> 01:11:59.750
> P8: maybe like

1022
01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:03.409
> P8: 45 min.

1023
01:12:03.890 --> 01:12:09.739
> P8: 40, 40 to 45 min to launch to log into this website.

1024
01:12:09.820 --> 01:12:15.610
> P8: And then we finally get it. And the person I'm talking to go, you know we only have 10 min left.

1025
01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:17.870
Tyler: Oh, no.

01:12:17.980 --> 01:12:24.790
Tyler: Gosh, yeah, it's very frustrating. And I'm sure it's really frustrating for you as well. 

01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:29.170
> P8: Yeah.

1030
01:12:29.170 --> 01:12:37.470
Tyler: Yeah. Today, we weren't gonna make you sign in at the very least. So we wouldn't have made you do that. But it didn't help that the Zoom screen share didn't work.

1031
01:12:37.730 --> 01:12:39.940
> P8: Yeah, but thank you for your.

1032
01:12:39.940 --> 01:12:44.209
Tyler: Yeah, thank you. Yeah, of course. I hope you have a good weekend, [P8].

1033
01:12:44.210 --> 01:12:45.989
> P8: Yeah, we will. Thank you very much.

1034
01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:47.979
Tyler: Awesome. Thank you. Bye.

1035
01:12:47.980 --> 01:12:49.470
> P8: Buh-bye.
