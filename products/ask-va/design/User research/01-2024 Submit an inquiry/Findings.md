## Research goals
Ask VA can support Veterans, their family members, and other submitters at all stages of the Veteran journey, from starting up to aging.

The key goals of this study were to:

- Review whether Veterans understand when they need to authenticate and the benefits of authentication
- Review the experience of a Veteran asking a question about their own benefits
- Understand what Veterans expect to happen after they submit a question

## Research questions

Review whether Veterans understand when they need to authenticate and the benefits of authentication:
* Is it clear when you need to authenticate vs. when it’s optional?
* Are the other benefits of authenticating clear?

Review the experience of a Veteran asking a question about their own benefits:
* Is the purpose of Ask VA clear?
* Is there information missing on any question, page or sequence of pages?
* Are there too many or too few fields per page?
* Is it clear why each question is being asked?
* Do users understand how to edit their answers on the review page?

Understand what Veterans expect to happen after they submit a question:
* Is it clear what happens after you submit a question?
* Are there any surprises or outstanding questions after reading information on the submission page?

## Methodology 

This was a moderated usability study conducted remotely over Zoom. We used a Figma prototype with limited interactivity.

We tested the following steps:
* Start page
* Chapter 1: Category and topic
* Chapter 2: Your question
* Chapter 3: Personal information
  * Only ‘My own benefits; I’m the Veteran’ branch
* Chapter 4: Review and submit
* Submission page

## Hypotheses and conclusions

|Hypothesis|Conclusion|Explanation|
|:--|:--|:--|
|Some users will think authentication is required in order to ask any question.|Definitely True|At first glance, all users think that authentication is required to ask any question.|
|Most Veterans will find the form fields are straightforward and intuitive to use.|Definitely True|Most form fields (radio buttons, text input, checkboxes) were very intuitive to use. Facility search is the only place we saw potential confusion.|
|Some users will be surprised at the amount of information they have to give in order to ask a question.|Definitely True|All users were surprised by the length of the form and most users didn't expect to have to give this much information to ask a question.|
|Some users will misinterpret the chapter numbers as the number of pages, and be surprised at the length of the form.|Definitely True|Most users were confused by the progress bar because they interpret the chapters as steps.|
|Some users will be confused about which information they can edit on the review page and which they cannot.|Likely True|While all users can identify the right 'Edit' button on the review page, some users think they can edit their contact preference, which is not editable.|
|Most users will expect an estimate of how long it will take to receive a reply.|Definitely True|All users notice the 7 days turnaround time and don't expect a more specific estimate than that.|

## Details of findings 

### Finding 1: Veterans past experiences and trust in VA impacts how they perceive questions and what information they're comfortable sharing.

_Labels: `AUD: Veterans`, `PRDT: AVA`, `DSC: Ask users for pronouns`, `DSC: Ask users for gender`, `DSC: Ask users for social security number`_

Veterans often begin interactions with the VA feeling frustrated and cautious.

When a question feels irrelevant or it's unclear why the VA is asking for certain information, Veterans make assumptions. For example, Veterans worry that their service will be impacted if they respond "no" to "Are you a VA employee?"

Similarly, Veterans react negatively to required questions about their pronouns and gender, with most people saying they would prefer not to answer.

Concerns about who will see their information and answer their question make Veterans cautious about sharing sensitive information.

> "It's almost a balance of power thing. The VA requires me to give all these little blocks of information. But they aren't required to give anything back. Whereas, on secure messaging, I'm asking a known person or at least agency, like my primary care physician's office, a question. It feels more human." P5

> "A wee bit intrusive again. Somebody's gender identity shouldn't have any bearing on VA benefits." P5

> "'Are you a VA employee?' Why this is here? [...] Because it means if you're [an] employee, instead of waiting 6 months to get an answer then [they] answer you right away?" P2

> "[I'm worried about giving my] Social Security number, because this is gonna go to a general mailbox [...] It's not going to a specific person or department." P8

> "[I'd like to know] where the question was going to [...] I want to feel like the skilled people are handling this issue." P1

**Note:** [This Ask VA study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/iris/research/ava/2021-04/research-plan.md) found that, "users were unsure what to put for 'Veteran's Service Number,' most thought it was their Social Security number."

### Finding 2: Many Veterans will choose to sign in so their information is pre-filled, but don't fully understand when sign in is required to use Ask VA.

_Labels: `AUD: Veterans`, `PRDT: AVA`, `PRDT: Login`, `PRDT: VA.gov Profile`, `DSC: Alert boxes`_

There are different reasons why most Veterans think you need to sign in to use Ask VA. First, the link to continue without signing in is hard to find.

Also, Veterans who are familiar with VA.gov feel that the VA encourages them to sign in. And they expect their information to be pre-filled, saving them time and energy.

A few Veterans made an assumption based on their experiences using other tools or calling VA, that they'll only be able to ask general questions if they don't sign in. They also expect VA to ask for less personal information, in this case.

Ultimately, Veterans don't have all the information to help them make informed decisions about why to sign in and when it's actually required. For example, if your question is about education benefits or work study.

> "The way I was told and taught by VA is that unless you sign into your account, it's just general. And they don't tell you specifically what's your problem. So usually, I want to sign in directly." P10

> [If I sign in] it automatically goes to my information and I don't have to input it." P8

> "I'm confused, because there's the one link that says, that's green, and it talks about signing in for my education benefits or work study. And then there's another sign in or create account below that." P6

> "I decided to ask a question without signing in. That means I don't want to give you my information. But so far, [you've already asked for] a bunch of personal information." P2

> "If I chose not to sign in, I would expect a lot of these screens not to exist. [If I] signed in, I would expect that information to already be linked to [me]." P5

**Note:** [This Ask VA study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/193) found that, "while noting the benefits of the authenticated experience, [participants] expressed interest in an anonymous path for asking general questions." It also found that, "[participants] expect the authenticated experience to bypass the need to input the most sensitive information." And [this Ask VA study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/iris/research/ava/2021-07/research-plan.md) found that, "all participants expressed interest, or preference, in logging in to complete the form."

### Finding 3: As Veterans get further into the form, they become more unsure about what progress they've made and what to expect next.

_Labels: `AUD: Veterans`, `PRDT: AVA`, `DSC: Progress bars`, `DSC: Ask users for names`, `DSC: Ask users for addresses`, `DSC: Ask users for phone numbers`, `DSC: Ask users for email address`, `DSC: Ask users for contact preferences`_

When the progress bar doesn't update, Veterans find it frustrating and unhelpful.

After they choose a category and topic, Veterans expect all questions to be related to their category and topic. This makes certain questions seem irrelevant or redundant. And their flow feels interrupted.

Veterans also expect to provide personal information earlier in the form and to finish after they enter their question.

Veterans suggested consolidating related questions, particularly about their personal information, to make the experience feel more cohesive and less long.

> "We went off track [...] from health care, we just went to general customer service stuff." P1

> "On the progress bar, we're still at 2 of 4 [...] We've gone from annoyance, to misleading to now lying. Now it's a trust issue." P3

> "I have a question, that's why I clicked Ask VA, like, what is all this? [...] We can file a complaint about a service? I think that should be separate. P7

> "A lot of the information could be condensed into less pages [...] I think the personal information should be moved up front before the final what's your question piece?" P7

> "I already clicked, on a previous screen, that I have a question, or I want to know about my benefits. So yes, I do have a question. Why are you asking me this again?" P5

### Finding 4: Most Veterans considered what their benefits cover in order to answer, 'What's your question about?' – which is unrelated.

_Labels: `AUD: Veterans`, `PRDT: AVA`, `DSC: Ask users for relationship to Veteran`_

The distinction between choosing 'my own VA benefits,' 'someone else's VA benefits,' or a 'general question' is unclear.

Veterans didn't interpret the question as asking whether the inquiry is about themselves or someone else. Instead, they considered the scope of their benefits, leading to different interpretations.

Similarly, Veterans understanding of when to choose 'someone else's VA benefits' varied greatly. And many Veterans feel that general questions are only relevant if you don't sign in.

In contrast, answering whether you are the Veteran or a family member was consistent. Since these questions impact conditionals, it's important they're robust.

> "Those 3 really don't fit what I would want. I'm not looking at VA benefits because I know I'm already eligible. I'm not looking for someone else's VA benefits, in my situation, I'm the only Veteran in the household. [And] I have a specific question, not a general." P3

> "I can't see myself having just a general question for the VA. If it's a general question, I will look it up." P14

> “It's not about someone else's VA benefits. It's a general question [...] My own VA benefits might apply to eligibility and access [...] So it’s a general question.” P1

> "[If] you never got a rating for hearing, you don't know if that's something that would be covered [...] Maybe I should just ask a general question because it's not covered." P7

### Finding 5: Veterans refer to their health facility by the location, like "Atlanta VA", rather than the full name, "Joseph Maxwell Cleland Atlanta VAMC".

_Labels: `AUD: Veterans`, `PRDT: AVA`_

Veterans often identify their health facilities by location rather than the actual name, like "Atlanta VA." 

Even when they said they would search by name, many people are effectively using the location as the search term. 

Some Veterans say their search behavior would be different if they aren't already familiar with their VA. 

If they sign in, Veterans expect this information to pre-fill from their profile.

Also, early on in the experience, many Veterans expected to give information about where they're located. They feel this will help the VA send them to the right facility or give them local information.

> "By location, I know where I'm at but I don't know necessarily the name of my VA facility. I don't know whether I put in San Francisco or what have you, under search by name." P5

> "The thing that's confusing with this, is, I already know what my healthcare facility is, so I don't need to search." P3

> "The people working there [...] they're going to say I work at the Tampa VA [...] Nobody knows [the full name], nobody uses it." P2

> "I started typing in search by name, if I'm not finding [it] then I would do the search by location. I'm assuming names would be associated with that too?" P3

### Finding 6: Most Veterans understand the purpose of reviewing their information before they submit a question, and can find the specific 'Edit' button they need.

_Labels: `AUD: Veterans`, `PRDT: AVA`, `DSC: Buttons`_

On the review page, most Veterans  focus on reviewing their personal information. People are unlikely to change their category and topic at this point.

Finding the right 'Edit' button is straightforward. However, in edit mode, it's likely that some people don't notice the items that aren't editable.

Some Veterans aren't sure why  certain responses can't be edited – even if they read the dismissible alert. For example, they wonder why they can't change their contact preference.

And a few Veterans initially thought the review page was going to ask more questions, so they found it repetitive.

> "I know my category and topic is correct. My question is correct. Let me just check the personal information, if I was going to check anything." P1

> "[I would] try to go over all these questions, making sure. [If, for example,] I changed my mind, and I need to change [...] how I want to be contacted." P7

> "I can't change this because it said I could only edit some answers. And clicking on it doesn't do anything." P5

> "I would go in here where it says phone number and put in the right number and then I go to the update button." P1

> "I already answered all of this [...] [The military] ask you repeatedly, the same questions over and over again." P8

### Finding 7: Veterans who are familiar with other VA services expect Ask VA to work similarly – and it may be unclear when to use Ask VA or another service.

_Labels: `AUD: Veterans`, `PRDT: AVA`, `PRDT: Secure-messaging`, `MHV: Secure Messaging`, `SFTW: Chatbot`_

Veterans that use My HealtheVet Secure Messaging expect Ask VA to work similarly.

But it's unclear whether to use Ask VA or Secure Messaging for health care related questions. Right now, there are at least 4 different places where Veterans can ask health related questions online.

The sign in alert on the home page also made some Veterans think that Ask VA is only for education related questions.

And some Veterans suggested concepts that are similar to other VA services, such as the chatbot. Similarly, some business lines have requested links to other tools from Ask VA, like, Quick Submit.

> "It was too lengthy to do, and at the end result not to get an answer?" P14

> "[You should receive a response within 7 business days] is probably going to throw up some red flags and irritate people." P6

> "I would sign in to my account. And I would probably use the messenger to contact my primary care physician." P5

> "I would assume they would have most of your information [like] some of your prevoius doctor visits or health issues you're experiencing [if you sign in]." P15

> "[It says] sign in or create an account if you have questions about education benefits. Is there going to be a separate window for other benefits?" P5

**Note:** [This chatbot study](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/880/views/1?filterQuery=chatbot&pane=issue&itemId=21794312) found that, "due to the amount of information and segmentation of experience for different VA touchpoints, many users struggle to find information that suits their needs."

## Additional insights

- Some people want to choose multiple contact preferences. Some people want text. Other Veterans don't believe the VA will follow it anyways.
- Most Veterans find entering their mailing address straightforward. For address verification, Veterans usually choose the suggested address.
- Most Veterans know what to expect after they submit a question.
- Some people are unsure what to do with their reference number, after submitting a question.
- For the most part, we didn't notice consequential differences between the mobile and desktop experiences. There's a chance the progress bar was less noticed on mobile.
- Some Veterans will choose to search for an answer themselves, and avoid contacting the VA.
- Veterans who worry about getting stuck appreciate that there's a 'Need help?' phone number if they need it.
- Many Veterans shared issues they have with signing in. 

## Recommendations

1. Design a progress bar that updates dynamically so it's always progressing forward.
2. Use a sub-task pattern to direct people to sign in based on the type of question they have.
3. Combine facility search by name and location.
4. Reorganize order of questions and chapters so it follows a more intuitive route.
5. Revisit pronouns and gender to see if they can be removed or at least made optional.
6. Add 'additional information' component to certain questions that raised flags.
7. Reorganize and edit content on the home page so it's more direct.
8. Remove US mail from contact preferences.
9. Default all accordions to open on review page.
  
## Next steps

We're preparing for our next round of research in April-May. We aim to implement all of our recommendations before then.

After this research, we also noted recommendations that we will not implement before our next round of research, but plan to explore in the future. These include:
- Use category and topic selected to direct users to other health tools when appropriate.
- Use location services to help submitters find a facility nearby.
- Update 'Contact us' content so the purpose of Ask VA is clear.
- Explore whether adding health facility to VA Profile is possible.
- Explore whether we can provide a summary of personal information up front.

## Further research needed

In our next round of research, we'll focus on testing the end-to-end experience of the form and dashboard. We'll revisit the progress component, if it's clear when to sign in and why and the order of questions. We'll also notice whether questions that raised red flags before feel less jarring given the new order of questions and more clarity about why they're being asked. We'll test the facility search again if we're able to implement a combined search by name and location. We plan to test in staging so we can include people who use assistive technology.
