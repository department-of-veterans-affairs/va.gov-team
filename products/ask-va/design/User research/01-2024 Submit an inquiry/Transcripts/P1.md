Research study: [Submit an inquiry (Round 1)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/ask-va/research/Submit%20an%20inquiry/Round%201)

## Transcript

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:07.129

Tyler: Alright. So are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio today? Yes.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:22.050

Tyler: Okay, thank you. So we've got through the beginning bit but before we get into the bulk of the research session, I just want to take a chance to get to know you and your experience with the VA a little bit better. How long have you been a Veteran?

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:29.460

> P1: Well, I was and listed in 74.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:40.220

Tyler: Okay, so a couple of years now. And have you been interacting with the VA since you became a Veteran, or just in the last couple of years?

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:58.420

> P1: Well, in the last several years in regard to medical care. And before that before that, and when I got discharged early, not early, but earlier in life I went to college with VA. Under the Gi bill.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:06.079

Tyler: Gotcha. Okay? So you have probably a long standing familiarity with some of the VA services. That's helpful.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.490

Tyler: Have you ever contacted the VA? Maybe online or over the phone?

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:37.769

> P1: Well, I contact them. I contact them online. The only one I talk to on the phone sometimes, like, is my doctor or nurse practitioner. But I contact them online with telehealth sometimes ordering prescriptions and everything mostly nowadays, it's just centered around healthcare.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:53.960

Tyler: That makes sense.

> P1: I don't have any more benefits than that. So yeah.

Tyler: Okay, so a lot of your interaction is about healthcare. And sometimes you're calling your doctor directly, or you're doing things like ordering prescriptions. That makes sense.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:01.660

Tyler: Alright. Well, we're gonna move on. And I'm gonna start by sharing a prototype with you. So I mentioned, this is not gonna work perfectly, but it's gonna do the job for today. And this is all about getting your feedback. So we want to understand how things are working. If things are confusing, if things are helpful and I'm gonna walk you through it and kind of guide you when we want to go to the next page and things like that.

Tyler: So I think you've done this before, because I'm pretty sure that we've met! So I'm gonna send a link in the chat. In the zoom chat, and I just sent you a link to a prototype. So it's a pretty long link, and it starts with www.figma.

Tyler: And if you just open that on your computer. Let me know when you've got it open.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:53.709

> P1: I have it. It's fully opening now.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:05.819

Tyler: Okay, great. So it's loading. So now we're gonna share your screen on Zoom. Have you done that before? I'm gonna give you a second to do that.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.260

> P1: Okay, and you want this prototype?

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:18.420

Tyler: Yes, please. Yeah, if you can just share that prototype. And I'll let you know when I'm seeing it. Perfect.

Tyler: Okay, great. So now I can see what you're seeing as well. It looks like it's a VA website.

Tyler: So we aren't gonna click on anything yet. I'm just gonna give you a moment to look at this page, and then I'd love for you to tell me what you're first noticing on this page. What's jumping out at you?

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:47.749

> P1: What's jumping out at me is Ask the VA. So if you have questions, you can, you know, pose your questions to the VA. I mean that's the most prominent thing right there. And after you have all the peripheral, the usual peripheral stuff on the VA website. Benefits and healthcare, you know, VA, locations, all that stuff is. 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.749

> P1: Should I scroll down?

Tyler: Yeah, you're welcome to.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:20.600

> P1: Okay, so all this is based on making an inquiry with the VA, asking questions then, so questions about benefits and services and documents. Okay.

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:42.249

Tyler: Okay, yeah, that's really helpful. I love how you described everything out loud to me. So it sounds like it's a familiar website, you can tell, you're on a VA website. And this is about asking a question or in making an inquiry to the VA.

Tyler: Great. So for the rest of our conversation today, I'm gonna have us pretend that you need to ask the VA a question. So we're gonna say that you've recently noticed some problems with your hearing. And you wanna ask the VA how you get your hearing checked by an audiologist. So without clicking anything yet, can you tell me what you would do first if you had that question?

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:11.350

> P1:  Well, if I had that question, I would... let me scroll down. Maybe there's a place for questions about... see it says, sign in for the best experience, so I would have to sign into an account or create an account like I see in this green box. But I have an account with the VA. So I would have to sign in.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:40.139

Tyler: Okay, so it sounds like, in order to ask a question about getting your hearing checked. Do you need to sign in?

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:46.769

> P1: Yeah.

Tyler: That's helpful. And it sounds like, you've got an account setup. So you would naturally just go and sign in.

> P1: Yeah.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.069

Tyler: Okay, that's helpful. And what are the benefits of signing in?

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:04.659

> P1: Well, if you sign in, this is just from my mind, not working from the prototype. When you sign in, you have access to all of the little, you know, drop-downs, whatever, all of these areas, you know. Again, mine is mostly on medical stuff. So you'll have pharmacy, you'll have, you know, email to the physician, team, and all of these drop-downs that you can choose from. Other stuff is on it, too. But I don't mostly use it. 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:37.659

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense. So when you think about the benefits of signing in, you're relying on your past memory of using other VA services. And it seems to have some things like almost tailored to you if you've signed in?

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.240

> P1: Yeah.

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:46.880

Tyler: And looking at this page, how long do you think it's gonna take for you to ask the VA your question?

00:06:48.500 --> 00:07:01.289

> P1: You should be able to ask the question right away. That's what I assume. After you sign in, and then just type the question in, or if it's on a dropdown, I don't know.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:07.730

Tyler: Do you think that you're gonna have to give the VA more information, or is it just going to be your question? What's your guess?

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.939

> P1: Well, the sign is, gonna come with just your username and password. Or if you have to create an account. I can't recall creating an account cause I've had mine for several years, but maybe you'd have to put in things like addresses and phone numbers and stuff like that. Sure.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:35.029

Tyler: That's super helpful. So for today, what we're going to do is we're going to scroll down a little bit. And we're gonna imagine that we're asking a question without signing in. Is there a way to do that?

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.520

> P1: Let's see. I don't see where there's a way to do that unless you went to this. No, because it's already highlighted. So Ask VA would give you what's here. So I don't see a way to ask without signing in.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:09.739

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. So you understood it says you can sign in after you ask a question...

> P1: But your question will be tied to your account. Where would the answer go? It would just go in the ethos, I guess.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:32.099

Tyler: Okay. So first off, it's not clear how to continue if you haven't signed in, but it does say that you can do that, but then it's a little confusing where your question will go...

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:40.399

> P1: Where the response would go, I don't know. Wait a minute. There's a continue without signing in. I just see on the bottom.

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:42.450

Tyler: Okay? So that took... that was a little bit hidden, would you say?

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:51.699

> P1: I don't know. My eyes just didn't go to it, you know. I don't know why.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:09:05.919

Tyler: Yeah, I think that's fair. It seemed really easy for you to see that you need to sign in and a little bit harder to see that you could continue without signing in, which is really helpful feedback. So let's go ahead and click on, 'Continue without signing in.'

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:20.249
Tyler: Okay. So I mentioned earlier that we're pretending like you need to ask the VA a question about getting your hearing checked. So with that in mind, can you show me what you would do on this page?

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.130
> P1: Let me make sure I got the whole page. Okay. So it says, I would go to this, where it says, Select the category that best describes the question, and I would click in the dropdown.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.670
Tyler: Okay, perfect. Let's go ahead and open the dropdown.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.759
> P1: Okay, so hearing would be in the area of Health care.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:46.849
Tyler: Okay, let's go ahead. Yeah, we can go ahead and click on health care. And then let's just talk about this for a minute before we click anything. So that felt really quick for you to choose healthcare. Did that feel like an easy choice?

> P1: Yes.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.720

Tyler: Okay. And how important do you think it is to answer this question correctly?

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:16.059

> P1:  I think it's very important. If it's about health care, I mean, hopefully it would be specific, not some, generalized, I don't know, mish mash answer.

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:29.160

Tyler: So you feel like you're gonna get a better answer because you chose the right category?

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:41.510

> P1: I think so, unless they have something in their system that would – if they use AI which would send their question to the right area. I don't know.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:56.520

Tyler: Okay, and when you said, they can send your question to the right area. Can you tell me what that means?

> P1: Say that again

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:11.610

Tyler: You mentioned they could use AI and that could send your question to the right area, what do you mean by sending it to the right area?

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:15.910

> P1: Okay. So if your question is financial in nature, the program would send that to a section that deals with finacnes. If it's about debt, or it's about health or it's about whatever it could be about. It records stuff like that like, if you typed in. I need a replacement for my DD 214 that would trigger them to send that to a records. Got it?

Tyler: Yeah, that's really, really helpful. So it feels like you have to answer this question right because it's important that your question goes to the right place.

Tyler: Okay, that's really helpful. Okay, we're gonna go ahead and move on so we can click – let's go to the next page.

> P1: Continue

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.760

Tyler: Perfect.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:13.579

Tyler: Okay, so I'll give you a second to look at this page, and then I'd love for you to just show me what you would choose on this page.

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:19.280

> P1: Okay, I would choose what they have at the top: Audiology and hearing aids.

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:22.930

Tyler: Awesome. You can go ahead and click on that one.

Tyler: And then, while we're here, I know our question today is about hearing. But I'd love for you to just look over this list. Is there anything that's jumping out at you that you don't understand or is not clear?

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:52.670

> P1: Nothing I don't understand.

00:12:57.290 --> 00:13:04.239

Tyler: Okay, so probably from your experience with interacting with the VA before some of these things sound familiar?

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:08.890

> P1: Yeah, some of them. I used the caregiver support program. When I first signed up for health care, eligibility and how to apply was important. I signed up for health care, eligibility, and how to apply was important.

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:28.469

Tyler: Yeah, awesome. And the last question we answered, you chose health care, and what's the difference between that question and the one you're answering right now on this page?

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:43.410

> P1: It's more specific in the area of healthcare. So in this case, hearing deficiency, or something like that.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:50.699

Tyler: And what if you came to this page and you couldn't find an option that fits your needs? What would you do?

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:54.370

> P1: What would I do? Probably choose an option that comes close enough to my needs. So I could get to some place where I could input the question.

Tyler: Gotcha, yeah. So you wouldn't let it stop you. You would try and continue and choose something close.

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:12.680

> P1: Just like when you're calling these customer support. You gotta just put something. So you can get a voice.


Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. I think I just have one more question on this page. So up here it says, your category and topic. What is that? What is that gray box describing?

> P1: It's describing, well, the first choice that you made, which was the category and the second choice that you're making the topic which is the Audiology. So it's just describing your choices so far.

Tyler: Gotcha. Okay, do you know why that might be there, or why that might be useful?

> P1: I want to say that at this stage of navigating the website, it doesn't seem to have much use, because there's only one thing in the box which is health care. But if you had to click, click, click, click, and it's gonna give you a list of everything every section that you've been to, then, you see how you're navigating the site to get where you need to go.

Tyler: Okay, Gotcha. So it's almost like you're thinking about it like a map of where you've been. Right now, you haven't been very far. So you don't really need your map.

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:41.739

> P1: Yeah.

Tyler: Gotcha, that's super interesting. Okay, we're gonna go ahead and click to the next screen. So you can go ahead and choose, continue. And just to remind you, we're asking a question about how you get your hearing checked. So can you show me what you would do on this page?

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.649

> P1: Okay, this page. What's your question about? So it's not about someone else's VA benefits? It's a general question.

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:15.440

Tyler: It's a general question and why do you think it's a general question? Can you describe that to me?

> P1: Because the other options – this, someone else's VA benefits that might be eligibility or something like this, and my own VA benefits again, might apply to eligibility, or, you know, access like that. So maybe I might not want to be specific about that, because that's not about my hearing problem. So it's a general question.

> P1: So I might click that and hopefully it would say... I don't see that box that was on the other page with the topic category and then question.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:17:05.080

Tyler: Okay. So couple of things that you're noticing. One is that that box is gone, and then another one is that you're telling me, you're not really associating your hearing question with your own VA benefits, it sounds more like a general question, so you would choose that. That makes sense. And what about what if you were gonna choose someone else's VA benefits, can you imagine a scenario where you would choose that?

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:19.480

> P1: Yeah. Cause I'm a caretaker for another Veteran. So if I had an issue like the PACT act that just came out for people who were exposed to burn pits and other things. I might want to go to someone else's VA benefits to see if he has a benefit regarding this latest changes and benefit structure.

Tyler: Gotcha. Okay, cool, so that one feels clear. As a caretaker, this is the one you would choose if you had a question about somebody else. Great. That's that's really helpful to hear how you describe each of these options.

Tyler: So what we're gonna do is, we're gonna click on my own benefits today, which I know is not the option that felt most intuitive to you. So you'll have to just bear with me. And before we click on continue, how much longer do you think this form is going to be?

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:15.569

> P1: Okay. Something tells me I'm going to be at least 2 more clicks before the question.

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:17.830

Tyler: Okay, what's telling you that?

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:35.500

> P1: My experience of having to click. So it just feels like my own benefits. The next thing might be which benefit in particular, health care. education. Da, da, da. Okay. Next page. Okay, now, what is the health problem, is it... They might ask me, pulmonary audiology, vision, you know. Pharmacy. Click. Now ask your question.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:59.859

Tyler: Gotcha. Okay cool. So you feel like it's gonna keep asking more questions about your benefits and your healthcare and and trying to get more and more specific. And then you can ask your question. Okay, cool.

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:02.299

Tyler: Let's click, continue, and we'll see what happens.

Tyler: Alright. So can you tell me what you would do on this page?

00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:17.269

> P1: Reason I have a question.

Tyler: And you're laughing here. [We both laugh.] Can you describe to me what you might find a little bit funny about this?

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:31.369

> P1: You and I are talking and I anticipate I have a couple of more clicks. So here's click number one, right?

Tyler: Okay, so you're kind of like, oh, of course, there's another question cause. That's kind of what I thought would happen.

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:53.439

> P1: You know, I mean these other things. Maybe people they click these other things. I'm not. I'm not a particular commenter about customer service and that kind of stuff. I don't do that usually, we present moments all in there complaining, but you know. I just would click I have a question.

Tyler: Yeah, okay, so it feels really straightforward to answer this, and almost sounds like every time you go through the form. That's probably what you would be using it for. Because you're not someone who would probably reach out to complain.

> P1: I'm not. It's just me. I don't do that. I'm not a review person either. If I go to a hotel, I'm not gonna review the hotel. I leave.

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:41.720

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. Why do you think the VA is asking this question?


00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:46.449

> P1: Because people have concerns? You know. Most people are not like me. I'm just a stale old, you know, curmudgeon, but some people actually have concerns about things. Maybe they had a nurse like this when I wanna say something nice. Maybe the the volunteer who pushed them in the wheelchair made the whole day, you know. They wanna say that, you know. I'm all for it, you know, but I just kinda, you know, my brain is not wired like that.

Tyler: Yeah, I think that's perfectly fine. And do you feel like this question needs to be here so that people know that they can say something nice or like, if this question wasn't here, could someone still say something nice?

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:28.130

> P1: Hmm. Probably. Well, what did we click before? See if we had that box then I'd know what we clicked before. Did we click the 8 benefits of something?

Tyler: Yeah, that's a good question. So you're feeling a little bit lost from what's happened – which might also be a subject of us talking a lot which is fair. But yeah, the last page said, what's your question about? And then we chose my own VA benefits.

00:21:55.770 --> 00:22:02.110

> P1: Okay. So my own VA benefits. A lot of this stuff doesn't have anything to do with that. You know these choices. Select the reason. Okay, so my own benefits. Select the reason why you're contacting us today. Okay, and what, say something nice has nothing to do with the benefit. I have a complaint about service. Maybe, I have a suggestion. Okay, I attended at Town Hall and now I have a question. I don't know. I don't see how those come into benefits.

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:34.350

Tyler: That's helpful. It feels a little bit disconnected from what the question you just answered, yeah, I can totally see that.

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:44.730

Tyler: Let's go ahead and move on. So let's click. I have a question and then we'll continue.

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:58.120

> P1: Okay, we've arrived.

Tyler: Yeah. Tell me about that. Did it feel like it took us a long time to get here? Or how does this feel?

> P1: For me, if I weren't communicating with you back and forth I would have just been click, click, click, click, click, click, click, so it wouldn't have seemed like a long time, because all that other stuff I would've just zipping through all of it where I can answer the end to the question.

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:32.040

> Tyler: Yeah, that's the focal point for you. Like, I'm here to ask a question. I want to type in my question. Let me just click through until I can do that.

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:34.770

> P1: That me. I hope it helps. But some people are like me. That's how they'll do it for sure.

Tyler: Yeah, that's super helpful. I think that makes complete sense. And then, just looking at this page, we're not actually gonna type anything in today. But does it feel straightforward? What you would do? Could you describe to me what you would do.

00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:53.910

> P1: It's straightforward for a person who's familiar with this particular type of page. But if the person wasn't, it might stay instead of what's your question? Maybe enter your question in the box, something like that, so they could be directed. I know that it's saying, you know, what's your question. So I would type my question in that box. Right?

Tyler: Yeah, that's a really good idea. And let's say we typed in your question. So we said, you know, I think I might be having problems with my hearing. I don't know how to get my hearing checked and please help me. And then we were gonna click, continue, how much longer do you think the form is going to be?

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:44.760

> P1: So if I click continue, it's gonna say we've received your question and, let's see, it would direct my question to the proper place. If it says, you know, somehow they knew, because to me we went off track. From the last page. From health care we went to jusst general customer service stuff, but if it got back to healthcare it would say, maybe that your question has been forwarded to the Audiology department and expect the response within 7 days.

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:37.510

Tyler: Gotcha, okay, that's really useful. So we kind of went off track. With the beginning, that was making sense. It was like healthcare, audiology. And then it went into customer service questions. But you think that after you enter your question, you're gonna get some sort of confirmation of where your question is being sent, and that it's it, it's done. Right. And your response time. Awesome. That's really useful.

Tyler: So we'll pretend like we typed in your question. Like I said, it's a prototype. So we can't type in this today, and we'll click continue. So can you show me what you would do on this page?

00:25:53.930 --> 00:26:02.449

> P1: I would be the Veteran.

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:10.519

Tyler: Right, that makes sense. Do you feel like there's ever a time when you would choose I'm a family member of a Veteran?

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:20.039

> P1: On any VA website?

Tyler: Yeah, on any VA website.

> P1: Yeah, actually, I do. Cause I do a fiduciary audit for my friend who I'm a caretaker for. And I have to click this one. I'm a family member of veteran.

Tyler: Okay. So it feels familiar to you because you have this experience as being a caretaker. Great. Okay. is there anything else you notice on this page?

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:57.209

> P1: Well, this says now we're gonna ask some personal information. So the next couple of pages might be more personal information, numbers, and whatever.

Tyler: Okay. I see your little shrug. Let's go ahead and click I'm the veteran, and then we'll continue.

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:20.660

Tyler: How would you answer this question?

> P1: I would say, no. I'm not an employee.

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:23.369

Tyler: Why do you think the VA is asking you this?

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:26.629

> P1: You know, I don't know.

Tyler: Okay. Well let's click continue. Perfect. So like I said, we're not actually gonna type anything in. But let's look at these questions, and I'd like to know if things stand out to you so you can go ahead and scroll, and then tell me if you're seeing anything that feels maybe different than you expect, or confusing.

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:56.880

> P1: Different than what I expect is your entire social security number. Not just the last 4. And service number. I'd have to go and get that, you know. It's not something that's in my brain. Date of birth, straightforward. And then, of course, in the 2000's you have to go through the pronoun stuff. So this is fallen into this inclusion, and I don't know what the terms, DEI, yeah. That's new to me. I haven't seen that on the pages.

Tyler: Let's talk about a couple of things. Let's start with the social security number. If we scroll up a little bit.

Tyler: So social security number, you were surprised that you're you're providing the whole number. Yeah, that makes sense. And then service number. You're like, Oh, I don't have that off the top of my head. I have to go find that.

Tyler: Does it feel like you need to give your social security number and your service number?

00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:20.660

P1: I don't know if they trying to use that as some type of security check, you know, I guess. But service number is going to send somebody in a tizzy. Like, I gotta find the DD 214, or I gotta find some document with a service number on it, though, you know, I've never used my service number. I don't think for anything I can't remember.

00:29:46.290 --> 00:30:00.410

Tyler: Okay, so your service number is not top of mind. And it's also kind of surprising that it would be something that they're asking for in this form. Great, let's move on. So you talked about pronouns...

> P1: Wait, one of the following. So if you did the social security, you wouldn't have to do the service number. So that's a reprieve, anyway. So that's good.

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:19.979

Tyler: Okay, that's good. So it's a reprieve. But also it wasn't obvious at first. So you might have maybe stress for a second about finding...

> P1: That one in bold as well.

00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:24.300

Tyler: Gotcha. Okay, cool. So it was a little bit easier to miss, which can be frustrating.

Tyler: Okay, let's scroll down to pronouns and gender. We're just gonna talk about this real quick. So you mentioned that this is like maybe part of a DEI initiative, and maybe also different to other forms you filled out with the VA. Is that right?

00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:44.240

> P1: I've never used... I've never seen this before this.

00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:57.109

Tyler: Yeah, so you've never seen it before. It sounded like it might be straightforward for you to fill it out. Like you would kind of understand your options. But you're surprised that it's part of this form. Is that right?

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:03.519

> P1: Not surprised. Okay. More like, here we are.

Tyler: Gotcha. It's more of a like, oh, now we're doing this. Okay.

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:23.009

Tyler: So let's go ahead and scroll down. We're going to pretend like we filled in this page with all your information. And then we're going to click continue.  Alright. So can you describe this page to me?

00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:33.050

> P1: Okay. Choose a health facility. So this will just ask, really the closest place to where you, where you go and get your services right. If you know the name of the facility.

Tyler: And is there another way to search?

> P1: It says, search by location. You just type in the town, or something.

Tyler: Which one do you think you would choose usually?

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:22.769

> P1: My mind goes back to before I actually knew where I was going. Maybe location. Yeah, search by location.

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:41.039

Tyler: So if you didn't know which health facility you go to, you would choose location. But now – I think you know your health facility, right? Because you're enrolled in healthcare. Okay? Got it. You would search by name. That's that's really interesting.

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:51.040

Tyler: We can't actually type in this today. But what we're gonna do is we're gonna pretend like, your health facility starts with James. So I'm gonna have you just click inside that box where you would normally type. We'll just click one time and we'll pretend like you typed in James. Okay now, what are we seeing?

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:02.750

> P1: Okay, you're seeing a few choices with which James is a part.

Tyler: And I'm going to say that your health facility is called James J. Peters. Can you show me what you would do next?

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:16.410

> P1: I would go down to this bottom one and click it.

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:20.429

Tyler: Okay. And now, what are we seeing?

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:25.320

> P1: So you're seeing the facility that you with requested highlighted as a choice.

Tyler: Okay. And without clicking anything. Let's say you chose the wrong facility you were like – Oh, no, that's the old facility I went to. What would you do on this page?

> P1: Back button.

Tyler: You'd hit the back button, and would that be the back button... Can you describe to me where that back button is on your page?

> P1: Right here next to continue. Well, maybe it's possible that if you just hit the one that you need. You could just hit it, and it would just change that you if you discovered the one that you need on this list. Let's say it was the Haley Veterans in Tampa. Say, oh, Tampa, I don't want New York, boom, and you just click Tampa.

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:24.000

> Tyler: Great. Let's go ahead and click continue. We're going go through these next these next few screens a little bit more quickly. Just in the interest of time. So looking at this page. Does anything stand out to you or or feel unfamiliar?

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:42.710

> P1: No.

00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:50.709

Tyler: Okay. And if we just think about the process overall, how much longer. Do you think the form will be now?

> P1:  I think this is like the last page, because it says back to the top. Asking you for feedback, like you, finished.

Tyler: Okay so it might be the last page.

> P1: Congratulations. You made it page might be next, okay.

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:21.430

Tyler: So we're kind of hoping for the congratulations page next, okay. So we'll pretend like we typed in your phone number. And email, we'll click continue.

Tyler: And now we're seeing this page. So this is different than what we expected. Without clicking anything yet can you tell me which option you would normally choose?

00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:32.290

> P1: Okay. I usually choose – if they allow it – phone and email, okay.

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:40.450

Tyler: Why do you like to choose 2 options?

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:56.079

> P1: Because the email I may not get to right away. But it's it's there, you know, and it's it'll be there as if I have time to like. Get it today. Not look at it tomorrow, not by my phone. If it's something critical. You know they ask for the phone. And then is it the best time to call, you know? Boom, boom boom type.

Tyler: That makes total sense. For today, just in the interest of of testing this website, we're gonna choose US mail. So we're gonna pretend like you'd prefer the VA sent you mail to respond to your question, and we'll click continue.

> P1: [Laughing] Alright. Is that realistic that people gonna click that us mail?

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:42.980

Tyler: Yeah. So it sounds like this... I mean, you laughed. I also laughed. It sounds like, maybe this is not an option you would normally choose. But in theory this is an option that you could choose. Yeah.

Tyler: Alright. So on this page, I'm just gonna let you show me what you would do here.

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:52.550

> P1: Okay. If this was relevant to me. I received mail outside the US on a military base. Okay, I don't know, or it, doesn't it... I would expect them to just say, put your address in.

Tyler: So it's a little weird that it's asking for your country first?

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:18.309

> P1: Because that seems to be like secondary, that you would live outside of the US.

Tyler: Okay, that's really useful. So it feels like it's focusing on like, are you outside the US instead of first assuming you're probably in the US. Yeah, that that makes sense.

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:39.069

Tyler: For today, we're gonna choose. We're gonna open that menu. And we're gonna choose United States.

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:40.640

> P1: Okay. United States. That's weird.

Tyler: Okay, yeah. And is it weird because of the military base thing? Or tell me why it's weird.

> P1: The country where you receive mail? Maybe in the broad picture, because it's military. And it's global I guess. But my mind is saying, the assumption is automatically the US. Maybe I have the wrong thinking in that area.

00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:37.479

Tyler: Yeah. So if I'm understanding you correctly, you're getting this feeling that this is favoring, or you know, another word might be like the majority of people are in the US that are using the form. But for some reason it's assuming that many people could be outside the US.

> P1: Currently serving outside the US? And is stationed someplace. I guess I see that.

00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:43.070

> Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense, I think I totally understand what you're saying. It feels like it kind of like first assumed you weren't in the US. And then it was like, are you in the US? So I can see how that's funny.

00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:51.010

> P1: But it should default to I'm in the US. And after, are you stationed overseas?

Tyler: Alright, that that's really useful. Let's click continue. And then here we're putting in your mailing address. Does anything stand out to you as different than what you're used to?

00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:09.640

> P1: No.

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:16.910

Tyler: Okay we'll click continue. We'll pretend, like we filled this in with your address. And then what is this page asking for?

00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:34.660

> P1: To make a choice of what the Post Office has as opposed to what you put in. Sometimes you see that they make this extended zip code and all this other stuff. Then they said, Well, which one would you like to use? Okay, that's for you.

Tyler: So it sounds like something you've seen before, maybe on another website. And do you usually choose what you entered, or what they suggest?

> P1: Sometimes this is just something that's not what I... They make a suggestion of enhancing like the zip code plus 4, you know. Okay, I can roll with that. There's no problem helps the post office. Right?

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:14.240

Tyler: Okay? So you'd have a read, and you'd make sure that the address they suggest makes sense. And then we would continue. Okay, let's go ahead and continue.

Tyler: Okay. So without clicking anything, yet, you can go ahead and look at this page. And then I'd love for you to just describe this page to me. What's what's the purpose of it?

00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:36.089

> P1: To make sure that you entered the information you thought you were entering, that you didn't enter something else. Causing a glitch in your communication.

00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:48.399

Tyler: Okay. And then we're not going to click anything yet. But if you were looking at this page on your own. What would you probably do next?

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:54.689

> P1: I would probably say, I know my category and topic is correct. My question is correct. Let me just check the personal information. If I was going to check anything.

Tyler: That's that's really interesting, I can see why you do that. So let's open category and topic. Let's just have a look real quick. Can you show me how you do that? Okay, perfect.

Tyler: Is this kind of what you expected to see? And it sounds like you wouldn't even really open this because you'd probably assume that that's that's right, do you think that's even something you would change at this point.

> P1: Yes [it's what I expected]. And no, I mean, I've been all over the Internet world. My question was about hearing loss. Right? Yeah. Oh, we're fine. We're good.

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:50.710

Tyler: Let's go ahead and open personal information, which it sounds like is the only one you'd probably open in real life. And you can just have a quick look through this. And you can tell me if anything's jumping out at you. Feel free to scroll if you like.

00:41:55.270 --> 00:42:23.339

> P1: Okay, so so I would just scroll through it all. I would scroll through all of this. Okay relationship, I'm the veteran. Okay, name, last name, you know, for you know, social security last 4 which would be good that they don't just put your full social security on everything, date of birth. Fine. Pronouns. Gender. My facility. Okay, I would just run down the list, phone number, email. You know, contact the US mail, my address. Now okay, the one I put in and scrolled it. I mean, I scanned it. Sure. No fine.

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:55.280

Tyler: Okay, perfect. So you'd scan through everything in the personal information you'd just be checking ot's all right. Let's say that you realized your phone number was typed in wrong. Can you show me what you would do?

> P1: So contact information edit. Okay then.

Tyler: We're not gonna type or click anything here. But just describe to me what you would do next.

> P1: Just go in here where it says, the phone number, put in the right numbers, and then I will go to the update button.

00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:25.890

Tyler: Got it cool. That's really helpful. That felt pretty straightforward for you. It's it looks like we can edit our phone number here. What else can we edit in this section?

> P1: The email. In case the email is wrong. Give it a quick look. There, okay, Tara black. We're good. And I would continue.

Tyler: What about your contact preference. Like, we chose to be contacted by US Mail. Can you edit that here?

> P1: Oh, wow. You can't. I don't think. No, it doesn't show an edit option. Unless that, I don't know doesn't have an edit option unless it's in the email address, I mean, the mailing address edit package.

00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:11.090

Tyler: Why do you think that you can't edit that one there?

> P1: Cause there's no edit box? There's no anything.

Tyler: Yeah, yeah, I can see that. And do do you know why that that might be? Does it feel like it's a mistake? Does it feel like it's intentional by the website?

> P1: Maybe they're not... I don't know why it would be intentional to not have the ability to change that, even though if you change that, you would have to delete all of that other address, country, and all that stuff, you know. I think all of it could easily be done. I'm not sure.

00:44:58.870 --> 00:45:08.679

Tyler: Cool. Well, I think that's a that's a good answer. We're gonna click cancel. We'll just pretend like you didn't actually need to edit your phone number, we'll just click cancel. And then we're gonna submit your question. So we're gonna be like, everything looks good ready to go.

00:45:14.350 --> 00:45:16.140

> P1: So I'll hit submit.

00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:20.659

Tyler: alright. I'm going to give you a minute to read this.

00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:40.860

> P1: Okay.

00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:45.399

Tyler: Okay, so can you summarize a little bit of what you read to me?

00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:54.270

> P1: So the question was submitted successfully, gave me a confirmation number that would be sent to the email which I would need, you know, for permanent storage, then says that you'll receive a reply in the mail within 7 business days, you know. I'm sorry. That's just funny.

Ty;er: I think that's fair enough. [Laughing].

Tyler: And is there any information here that you feel like is missing? Is there anything else you'd need to know at this point?

00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:24.589

> P1: Just that they put in here you should receive a reply through US mail and email, you know, everything else is fine.

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:42.559

Tyler: Yeah. Is that because if you chose US mail – I know you wouldn't – but if you did choose US mail, you'd also want an email?

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:43.760

> P1: Yeah. I mean, maybe someone doesn't use email... I don't know you're using a computer. Why would you not have email? Right?

00:46:56.120 --> 00:47:03.239

Tyler: Yeah. and what do you think's gonna happen next like you just submitted your question. What's the next step for you?

00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:06.229

> P1: For me? I would probably just because usually it says you'll receive your reference number is this, you'll receive an email confirmation. I would have expected that to happen immediately.

Tyler: So you'd probably check that you have an email confirmation. And then you'd kind of be like, I've done my bit.

00:47:26.590 --> 00:47:31.299

> P1: Yeah, wait my 7 days.

00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:40.799

Tyler: So it sounds like, usually you choose phone or email instead of the mail. So let's say that you chose phone. You know I want you to call me when you have an answer for me. And the VA calls you and they give you some information. And then you hang up. And you're like, okay, let me figure out what I do next? And you had a follow-up question. What would you do in that scenario?

00:47:56.110 --> 00:47:58.840

> P1: I hung up the phone? 

Tyler: Yes, you hung up. They said this is the answer I'll see you later. And they hung up and you were done. But 2 days later you had a follow up question. What would you do?

> P1: I'd go back to the website and ask the answer question.

Tyler: You'd ask another question? Yeah, that makes sense to me.

Tyler: Well, we've talked a lot about this prototype. I think what we can do for the next 8 or so minutes is just kind of reflect on what we did together. We can stop sharing your screen. So if you see the stop sharing button, it should be red somewhere towards the top... Perfect.

00:48:39.110 --> 00:48:44.330

Tyler:  So what do you think of that process overall? Is there anything that you liked about it?

00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:50.780

> P1: Hopefully, because I didn't see the end result, so hopefully the question goes right to where it needs to go to, and that will be fine. I don't know if our talking through it made it seem like long and like I was losing my place in the process. Maybe there's just cause we have a discussion. But other than that, I think it's fine.

> P1: Just hopefully the program itself be streamlined, that the question would go where needs to go. There was one glitch where it went from healthcare to you just wanna talk you, you know you wanna chill out.

00:49:49.780 --> 00:50:09.970

Tyler: Right. Yeah, I noticed that it felt like you were like, I get it what the forms doing, I'm following the process. And then it was like what? There's this differen thing. I totally understand that.

Tyler: It's it's tricky, because we did talk a lot while we went through the process. So it does make it feel longer. But I also think throughout the process you were describing to me how many steps would you'd expect to be next, and it was always more than you expected. So you'd say, I think it's gonna be 2 more steps. And you were already over estimating based on your experience, and it was still more steps. So I think it still wasn't totally meeting your expectations.

> P1: Not as streamlined. But I will say that additional steps seem to have be part of another package of the information collection. So okay.

Tyler: Okay so it's not so frustrating because you're like, I kind of understand why they're asking me for this thing or why they might need this.

> P1: But I am kind of surprised that there's this many pages. I mean, yeah, there was a lot of pages.

00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:15.829

Tyler: I think I'll wrap up with, just like maybe 2 more questions. So one of them is just throughout the process, I was asking you how much longer this would take, did you ever notice that there was a bar at the top of the screen that says the number of steps?

00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:30.140

> P1: I didn't notice that. No.

00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:36.750

Tyler: That's okay. It was helpful for me to see that that wasn't noticeable. So that was really useful.

> P1: You could have a blinking.

00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:52.089

Tyler: Oh, you mean we could make it blinking. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's one way.

00:51:52.090 --> 00:52:11.339

> P1: I applied for a visa when I was traveling internationally, and they had a thing on the it's electronic form. So you've been on this page for 17 seconds, 18 seconds, 19 seconds. It's like, okay, I don't know what's the deadline. Let me get off this page!

00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:31.910

Tyler: That sounds stressfull! There's probably a balance. For that. Overall, did you feel like the form was descriptive enough? Were there moments when you wanted like more detail. Like, you know, healthcare was really easy for you to choose. But did you feel like there was moments when you wanted more detail, or it was the right amount of detail?

> P1: That question was going to... you think you'd want to know that when you chose health care, or at the very end. Okay, health care, audiology. And whatever the other word was, okay, your question will be directed to [this department]. I don't know what you know. That might be something you would like to have. I want to feel like the people, the skilled people, are handling this issue. And nothing against receptionist, but [I want to know my question is not going] to the reception, you know.

Tyler: Yeah, no, that makes sense. I mean, we're asking you a lot of questions to make sure your question goes to the right place. So I can see how you also want reassurance that it's happening. Cause you're putting in the work. I think that's really clear.

00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:49.330

Tyler: How does this compare to other experiences of maybe you've contacted a bank or another company online?

> P1: I can't think of who I've contacted. I'm sorry. I don't have much of a comparison. That's I don't know or I can't remember or anything like that is always an acceptable answer.

Tyler: That's okay! I've asked you a lot of questions, and I just want to leave a little bit of time for you to ask me any questions. Do you have any questions, maybe, about this process about what we're doing, or anything like that?

> P1: No, no, no, I'm glad you guys are working, and, you know, make things easy and good. To be commended.

Tyler: Well, we really appreciate you, because, yeah, there's a lot of things that we can't do without that the support and the help from Veterans like yourself. So I noticed a lot of things differently because of what you told me.

> P1: The information that I give might not be as beneficial because the people who need help... I kind of can just navigate through these things like a lot of stuff. I just skip, skip, skip. Other people can't get there like that, and I feel bad for them, you know. Whatever you can do to make it easy for them is is good.

Tyler: Yeah, no, I appreciate that. And I think it's been a common experience for me when I speak to Veterans like yourself, where they're like, I want you to remember that not everybody's gonna have as easy a time as me using this website. So I totally respect that. And I guess, for peace of mind, a lot of what we try and do as researchers is, make sure we're talking to people from all different sorts of backgrounds, experiences, level of like computer use and all that kind of thing so that we can try and make it better. So your feedback is really helpful for different reasons than maybe another person's feedback. But I appreciate you always reminding us of that.

Tyler: Well, I hope you have a lovely rest of your day. Perigean, the folks who set up this session, are going to send you a thank you note and they'll give you information that you can pass on to other Veterans if they want to participate in future sessions.

> P1: And yeah, I hope you have a lovely day, and you too, and all the other listeners.
