# P10 - January 29, 2024

## Transcript

Tyler: Alright. So are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio today?

> P10: Yes.

Tyler: Thank you. Do you have any questions for me at this point?

Tyler: Okay, awesome. Well, we got through all the beginning bit. So I know that was a lot of information. But if anything comes up, just let me know.

Tyler: Before we jump into the prototype that I mentioned we're gonna look at together, I just like to learn a little bit more about you and your experience with the VA.

Tyler: How long have you been a veteran?

> P10: Oh, boy, since I got out of the service in 1995. So I've been with the Va since about 1995, 96.

Tyler: And when you got out of service, did you start interacting with the Va. Right away, or only in the last couple of years?

> P10: Took about maybe about 2 years to give or take to get fully activated with the VA. At the time is a little bit difficult because they were so far out.

Tyler: Gotcha. Okay.

Tyler: And now, are you enrolled in healthcare? How are you interacting with the VA these days?

> P10: Mostly with healthcare.

Tyler: Have you ever contacted the VA?

> P10: Yes.

Tyler: How do you usually contact them?

> P10: Either by email or by secure messaging through my healthevet.

Tyler: So you'll email them or you'll use secure messaging. That's really helpful.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.330

Tyler: have you been using secure messaging for a while now?

> P10: About a year.

Tyler: Yeah, is there anything you like about it?

> P10: Sometimes it's quick, sometimes it's slow. The biggest problem I have is actually getting into it.

Tyler: So signing in?

> P10: Yeah. the old system that they had worked beautifully, and for some strange reason. this new system that they got It's hit or miss sometimes it's slow.

Tyler: Okay, so you're liking secure messaging. Sometimes it's quick to get in and sometimes it's slow. And the sign in part is usually the biggest hurdle.

Tyler: Yeah, that's helpful. So that's really interesting that you're using secure messaging. Because what we're gonna talk about today and the prototype I'm gonna show you is a little bit similar to secure messaging in that, you know, when you use secure messaging, you generally have a question, and you're seeking information from someone from the VA. And in the case of secure messaging, it's obviously your care team right?

Tyler: And so what we're gonna be looking at today is a service called Ask VA. And this might be a little bit different to secure messaging. So throughout our conversation feel free to bring up comparisons, if that's helpful. And I might even ask you more questions about secure messaging.

> P10: Okay.

Tyler: alright. So let's go ahead and get started. We're gonna set ourselves up. With this prototype. So I'm gonna send you. It looks like you're in your computer, right? Not your phone. Okay, I'm gonna send you a link to the prototype in the Zoom chat.

Tyler: So you're going to get this really big link. Alright. So let's go ahead and open that on your computer.

> P10: Okay, you still here?

Tyler: Yep, I'm still here so I can see you, but you might not be able to see my me while you're looking at Figma. Yeah. So do you have that open now on your computer?

> P10: It's opening up now. Okay, it's loading.

Tyler: Okay. So while that loads, why don't you come back to zoom. Can you find your zoom window where you can see my face?

> P10: Okay.

Tyler: okay, so you can see me now. Alright, have you shared your screen on Zoom before?

> P10: No.

Tyler: we'll do that together. So when you're on the zoom window, where you can see my face. If you look at the very bottom it I'll have a bunch of little icons, and one of them in the middle is green. It says, share screen. You see that one? You can go ahead and click on that.

Tyler: And that's gonna ask you to choose your screen. So you're gonna have to look for that link.

> P10: It says desktop one.

Tyler: Yeah, that sounds right. That's probably what it is. Although that could actually be your desktop. We'll see.

Tyler: I'll let you know when I can see something.

> P10: just so, you know I'm on a Mac.

Tyler: Okay. so far, I'm not seeing your screen. But you can take your time.

> P10:  And I have whiteboard. Okay, ipad, the iphone ipad safari. That's where the Figma was.

Tyler: Why don't we try safari? So if you click on safari and then you click share in the bottom right corner of your window. Okay?

> P10: Did that work?

Tyler: I'm not seeing it yet. So tell me what you're seeing.

> P10: No, okay, hold up. Hold up. I see what's going on.

Tyler: So can you describe what you're seeing to me?

> P10:  Alright. So what it wants me to do is allow zoom to share or do things.

Tyler: Okay, I've had this happen before. So you're gonna have to give permission to zoom. Do you want to try and give this a go with me?

> P10: Sure.

Tyler: Okay, so you're gonna you're gonna have to leave Zoom, so we won't be able to talk while you do this, but when you close zoom, you can open your it should open your system preferences on your Mac and then you're gonna have the zoom app. It should open everything for you, and you're gonna have to allow screen share.

Tyler: And this whole time you're not going to be on zoom. And then you're gonna have to come back to zoom. So you probably had a link in your email to get into this meeting right? Okay, cool. So you'll go ahead and just rejoin the meeting, and I'll be waiting here.

Tyler: it doesn't work. After a couple of minutes, just rejoin the meeting, and we'll go from there. Okay, alright, I'll see you soon.

Tyler: Alright. It looks like we're back. How did that go?

> P10: I think I did it.

Tyler: Okay cool. Now I can see you. And now let's go ahead and try and share screen.

> P10: Okay.

> P10: alright. So I see it says, desktop one and safari launch meeting. And I can't remember where that was

Tyler: Yeah, that's okay. So what we can do is I'm just gonna send you the prototype again. And then let me know is that opening in safari?

> P10: Hold up. And I don't want to lose you.

Tyler: Yeah, I know the feeling. I can still hear you and see you. So okay.

Tyler: Perfect. It looks like I can see your screen now. So we're just gonna change tabs on safari.

Tyler: Do you know what I mean by change? Tabs?

> P10: Yeah.

Tyler: Yeah. cool. So I'll give you a minute to yeah, that looks like the right one desktop. Yeah, let's click on desktop prototype. 2.

Tyler: We did it. Okay. So now I can see your screen. So I'm seeing the same thing as you. And we're all set up.

Tyler: We're gonna just wait a minute before we click anything.

Tyler: so like, I mentioned this, this session is about getting your feedback. So we're gonna look through this website together. I'm gonna kinda guide you when we're ready to to click on things or sometimes I'm gonna ask you to show me where you would click okay, so on this page. I'm just gonna give you a minute to look around. We're not gonna click on anything, but you're welcome to scroll, and I'd love for you to tell me what you noticed first.

> P10: Let's see. Well, the biggest thing I noticed is that it's a VA Department of veterans affairs. So I know it's correct. And then I see the blue sign in box. And that's where they told me to sign in.

Tyler: Okay, and That's really helpful. So you know, you're on a VA website, and you see a blue sign in Box which is, where have you signed in before using that blue sign in box. Okay? So that looks familiar to you as well. Awesome. And if we're looking at this page that we're on now, what is this page about?

> P10: Says Ask VA. And it says, get answers to your questions about VA Benefits and services and upload documents online. You should receive his response in 7 days. Which is surprising. Okay.

Tyler: And why is that surprising?

> P10: Because usually the VA is sometimes faster than that.

Tyler: Okay, so it feels a little bit long. That makes sense. Alright. And if if I told you so for the rest of our conversation, we're gonna pretend, like, you have to ask the VA a question. Okay. So we're gonna say, you recently noticed some problems with your hearing.

Tyler: And you want to ask the Va. How to get your hearing checked. So you don't know how to get your hearing checked. You just know you probably need to see an audiologist. and so we've come onto here to ask the VA what to do.

Tyler: So without clicking anything. Yet can you tell me what you would do first? Where would you click?

> P10: I would probably sign in to my account. and then I would hit contact us under that.

Tyler: That makes sense. So you first sign in up at the top, and that with that blue button and you click contact us. Okay, does it seem like you need to sign in in order to ask a question?

> P10: Usually when you deal with the VA, the way I was told and taught by VA is that unless you sign into your account, it's just general. And they don't tell you specifically what's yourp roblem. So usually, when I sign in, I want to sign in directly for what my problems and concerns are.

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:57.889

Tyler: that makes sense. That's really, that's really helpful. So your and your experience and from what the VA told you signing in is gonna give you more specific information okay, that makes sense. If we scroll down a little bit on this page. can you tell me what we're seeing here with this green button? Can you describe this to me?

> P10: Signing in is required. If you questions about education, benefits, work, study, or debt. You need to sign in. If your questions is about education, pens, work, study, or debt.

> P10: Well, I guess they're talking about questions of education, benefits and work-study and debt. To sign in. If you have any questions about that.

Tyler: Okay, so if your question is about your hearing. Do you need to sign in?

> P10: Well. Let's see, well, it's for benefits. I guess. Maybe.

Tyler: Okay. So if it's for benefits, does that mean we need to sign in?

> P10: Maybe not. Maybe not.

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:09.530

Tyler: Okay. So I'm sensing. It's not super clear right? It's not an easy yes or no answer.

> P10: Right.

Tyler: Yeah, that's really helpful.

Tyler: Let's let's scroll down a little bit further. I'm gonna move us along. So if we go down here, we're gonna see a link that says you can continue without signing in. Okay, do you see that link

Tyler: alright? So why do you think that link is there? What does that mean?

> P10: That's a good question. Continue without signing in. I don't think I would ever want to click that in the first place.

Tyler: Okay. And that's because you described to me that signing in will get you more specific information?

> P10: Mhmm.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense.

Tyler: Well, I think that's really clear. It sounds like definitely the first thing you would do is sign in. For today we're gonna do something a little bit different. We're gonna see what it's like if we didn't sign in. So we're gonna continue without signing in, you can go ahead and click on that.

> P10: Alright.

Tyler: Okay. So now, before we click anything else on this page, you can always feel free to scroll. However you like. I mentioned that we're asking the Va. How to get your hearing checked. With that in mind. Can you show me what you would do on this page? You can go ahead and click.

> P10: Well, I would probably hit a category. I would probably hit that. Okay. And let's see.

Tyler: What are we seeing here?

> P10: A bunch of different categories. and I would probably hit healthcare if it were for a hearing.

Tyler: Okay, let's choose healthcare. Awesome. We'll just stay on this page for a second a second before we continue.

Tyler: So that felt really quick for you to choose healthcare.

Tyler: How important do you think it is to answer this question correctly?

> P10: Very important. Because the one thing that I noticed with government websites, if you don't get to a particular spot right away.

Tyler:And at this point in the process, how long do you think this whole process is? Gonna take to ask the va, a question about your hearing.

> P10: Hmm. I don't know.

Tyler: Yeah, I don't know, is always a good answer. So let's click continue.

Tyler: And now we're seeing this page. Can you show me what you would do on this page?

> P10: Well, considering it would be my hearing, I would hit audiology and hearing aids.

Tyler:And then how is this question different from the last one? You answered?

> P10: More direct, it's more direct.

Tyler: Okay. Why do you think the VA is asking you this?

> P10: Well it says, get answers and questions about VA benefits and services and upload documents online. And we hit healthcare and audiology and hearing aids. So what I like about is, it's right there. Yeah, so i'm not searching for anything.

Tyler: so you liked, how it narrowed it down, for you. yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: What is this box here that says your category and topic? What is that?

> P10: Well, it's telling you that the category and topic is healthcare, so that you're at right now.

Tyler: Is that useful for you?

> P10: Yeah.

Tyler: Why is that useful?

> P10: Because it's labeling what you're searching under.

Tyler: Okay, so it's showing you where this list of topics fits. Okay, that makes sense.

Tyler: Alright. Let's go ahead and continue to the next page.

Tyler: Okay, so can you show me what you would do on this page.

> P10: Well, I would continue to scroll down. And that says, what is your question about? And then that's a selection for what your question is about. And you have, I would look at, is either my own VA Benefits or a general question. since most of the time when I go to the Va. I'm asking about myself. I would probably hit my own Va. Benefits.

Tyler: That's really helpful to hear how you're thinking about it. So because it's probably about yourself, specifically, you're going to choose my own benefits. And then a general question, what would that maybe be for?

> P10: I think that would be just a general question about everything.

Tyler: Okay. So wouldn't be focused on you. It would be more general. Okay, that makes sense to me. So let's choose my own Va. Benefits like you said.

Tyler: And at this point, how much longer do you think this form's going to be?

> P10: Well, it says 2 of 4. So we're about halfway through. I don't think, yeah.

Tyler: Okay. So it feels like we're halfway through. And we just noticed it says 2 of 4.

Tyler: Alright. And what do you think that the VA still needs to know from you?

> P10:  Well, probably who I am and where I'm located.

Tyler: Okay, who you are and where you're located. That makes sense. So let's click, continue. And we're gonna see what happens next.

Tyler: why don't you go ahead and describe this page to me?

> P10: Well, it's still under Ask VA Get answers to questions about VA benefits and services, upload documents online. And they want to know what the question, the reason for contacting us.

Tyler: And they want to know what your question is. 

> P10: So they want to know the reason you're contacting us. And what your question is.

Tyler: Okay. that makes sense. So let's look through these options. And then which one do you think you would choose?

> P10: Oh, it would probably be I have a question, the first option.

Tyler: Okay, let's click. I have a question. Why do you think the VA is asking you this?

> P10: Because you're contacting them. And you have a question.

Tyler: So you think that the VA wants to confirm that you have a question. Okay. And what about these other options in the list? Can you imagine choosing one of these other options? Maybe in a different scenario?

> P10: No, if you want to say something nice. You have a complaint. or have a suggestion. attending the town hall. No, I have a question, I don't, never intended a town hall. So I have nothing of the anything about that. Or you want to say, something else.

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.150

> P10: I think, just how the – I think it's just a little bit too much. You know what I mean.

Tyler: Yeah, tell me more about that. Why is it a little bit too much?

> P10: Because if you're just contacting them with a question, you're just throwing in a couple little things in there that doesn't have anything to do with what it's asking. Okay, it could get a little confusing.

Tyler: Okay, cause you came here to ask them a question. Now, there's these other things here.

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:47.440

Tyler: Yeah, I can totally see that. Okay, let's click continue.

> P10: And this is nice. So now, you can put actually your question in.

Tyler: okay, so this is nice. Why is this nice?

> P10: Because it allows you to say in your words what you're here for.

Tyler: So this is kind of a point in the process that you were maybe expecting. And you're happy to see it.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. And so we can't actually type in this prototype.

Tyler: But it felt clear to you that here's where you would go, and you type in your question. Okay. And at this point, let's say, we type in your question. Before we hit continue. What else do you think the VA Is going to ask you?

> P10: Well, they're still gonna ask me who I am and where I'm located, cause they don't know those 2 things yet, right?

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:58.779

Tyler: And how much longer do you think the form's gonna be?

> P10: Well, we're still about half way.

> P10: We're in the second line here in the blue. So we're still haven't entered 3 or 4 yet.

> P10: But what I like is, it has an 800 number down here. So if you get stuck you can call somebody.

Tyler: That's a great observation. So you just noticed there's the 800 number. And and that way you wouldn't be kind of lost if you if you needed help. Awesome. Okay. Well, we'll pretend like we typed in your question. We'll click. Continue.

> P10: Okay. We moved over one.

00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:47.009

Tyler: We moved over one. And are you talking about the the bar? Okay. So we noticed that pretty quickly. And what else are we noticing on this page.

> P10: This is what I would expect. Are you a family member? Are you the Veteran himself? I would be hitting the under Veteran.

Tyler: Okay, so you're the veteran you can go ahead and select. I'm the veteran.

Tyler: And and why is the Va asking this?

> P10: It says it's going to ask some personal information, and we use this information to help us understand your question, to find the answers you need. Now, they're starting to realize. Okay, well, who are you? And where are you?

(Employee)

> P10: This is one thing I could never understand why they always included this in here.

Tyler: Yeah, does this is this feel familiar?

> P10: This question it feels familiar, but I understand that some VA veterans are VA employees. I think the majority, though of this part I would expect this to be on more of a portal for VA employees, not a portal for Veterans.

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:12.589

Tyler: Right. Okay. So you think the majority of Veterans are not employees. So why are they asking this? Why do you think that they are asking this?

> P10: maybe they need to find out if you work for them or not?

Tyler: What impact do you think that'll have if you choose? Yes or no?

> P10: It's just that, I think with some people when they look at this they get confused.  And when I look at this, the first question in my mind is, why is this here on a Veterans website, it should be on a VA employees website.

Tyler: So it feels very out of place.

> P10: Yes.

Tyler: Yeah, that's really helpful. That makes sense to me. Well, what would you do if you had to answer this page? Can you show me?

> P10: I would hit no.

Tyler: Okay let's go ahead and click continue now.

Tyler: Okay. So describe to me what we're seeing here.

> P10: They want my personal information.

Tyler: we're not gonna actually type anything in like, I said. But let's look through these questions, and I'd like to know if anything stands out to you.

> P10: Okay. They want required sections of first and last name, which is good. The suffix which I think is mr, miss or mrs. They'd like a preferred name. Well not really required. They want your social security number and service number. The service number, I've always wondered about because I'm 55 and I know when I was in the Navy I was the last group of people that got a service number back in 1986, and they haven't used service numbers since 86. So I think the vast majority of people don't even know what the service number is anymore.

Tyler: Yeah, no, that's a really good point. What would happen if you don't know your service number. What would you do on this page?

> P10: I'd put in my normal Social security number. Yeah. I mean service numbers. Most veterans don't remember them or know them. I mean, up until 1997. I used to know it, but after that I never used it anymore.

Tyler: Because you don't even know your service number at this point. Do you have any hesitation about putting your social security number in, why do you think the VA needs that?

> P10: Because they need to specifically know who you are.

Tyler: Okay. So they're trying to identify you. That makes sense. Okay, let's keep looking at these these fields and keep telling me how you're seeing them.

> P10: Okay, date of birth. That's obvious. They always want to know what year you were born.

> P10: Pronouns I'm used to. I used to work for the city of Pittsfield, and they started this section. So I know pretty much about pronouns. So I know that's part of diversity and all that stuff. So it's good to see it, but, also, on a personal level. It's not really necessary, but it's good to see it.

Tyler: otcha, that's helpful. So you said on a diversity level. It's good to see this on a personal level. It's not necessary. Yeah, that's helpful. Okay?

Tyler: And then anything else we're seeing here

> P10: Again with gender identity. It's good to see it on the diversity level, but personal level, not necessary

Tyler: Okay, yeah, that makes sense. So you don't need to tell me how you would answer these questions, but would you choose to answer them, or would you choose like, prefer not to answer?

> P10: I would probably answer it. But then again, maybe prefer not to answer.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense, especially cause you said, it's not necessary for you that this is here. But also, you recognize why it might be here.

Tyler: Okay, well, let's go ahead and continue, we're gonna go onto the next page. We're gonna pretend, like we put in all your information.

> P10: Okay. Still, under personal information.

Tyler: Okay. So we just noticed the progress still says personal information. And why don't you describe this page to me, what are we seeing now?

> P10: It says, your VA Health facility. and it says, search by name or search by location.  So that's a good thing, because now, they want to know where you are.

Tyler: And that's something you'd been waiting for them to ask you. Why do you think they need to know where you are?

> P10: Because I don't think they want to send me to a VA up in Alaska, right?

Tyler: So they want to be able to send you to the right VA. That makes sense and you mentioned it says, search by name and it says, search by location, what's the difference between those. Can you describe them to me?

> P10: Well, every VA facility has some sort of name. Right now, at the top of my head. I can't remember what the name of my VA facility is, so it would be better to search by location.

Tyler: And so when you say they have a name. Let's pretend like I've never heard of VA Medical centers before. Are you saying the name is like the Los Angeles VA. Or it's a different type of name that's hard to remember.

> P10: Well, I know that the VA down in [City], Massachusetts, which is the one I go to. They just named it after a Veteran himself, and I just can't remember. So yeah. I've always referred to it since I come up here from Pennsylvania. I've always referred to it as [City] VA. That's how most people remember.

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:02.550

> P10: But I'm trying to think of  what's that name? Something like Boland? I think they named it after...

Tyler: Okay so the name might be harder to remember. That's really useful. So usually you would search by location. And would you type in like your city? How would you search by location. What would you expect to do?

> P10: I would search in by city and state.

Tyler: City and state. Okay, great. So for today, we're gonna switch things up, because I know this is not normally how you would search. Well, now, I know but we're gonna pretend like we are searching by name.

Tyler: And we can't type today. So we're gonna pretend like we're typing. And we're gonna say that you started typing in James. You knew that was the beginning of the facility. So if you click on that box where you'd usually type

> P10: Right here, search?

Tyler: we're actually gonna click just to the left of that. Yeah, perfect. We'll click there.

Tyler: Okay, there's James, yeah. Okay, so you're gonna have to use some imagination. We just typed in James. And now what are we seeing? And then I saw your mouse went all the way over to search. Is that what you click next, do you think?

> P10: Yeah, well, it's you scroll down here. You can scroll down or you can click, search.

Tyler: Okay. So for the purposes of today, let's say your medical center is called James J. Peters.

Tyler: Can you show me what you do next Right here?

> P10:  I mean, hit that. [Now] James J. Peters is lit up.

Tyler: So that means maybe you've chosen that one? We don't need to click anything else now. But what if you realize you've chosen the wrong one. So let's say you were like, wait, I don't live in New York anymore. That's my old facility. What would you do at this point.

> P10: Oh boy. I would probably hit the back button hopefully, that would correct the problem. Okay.

Tyler: Wich back button? Can you tell me where on your screen?

> P10: The one down here.

Tyler: Okay, so you'd probably hit the back button and hopefully that would correct the problem, you said, yeah, okay.

Tyler: o we'll we'll keep this one. We'll say your health facility is James J. Peters, and then we'll just click. Continue.

00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:53.780

Tyler: Okay, so at this point in the process, before we look at this page too closely. How much longer do you think the form is going to be?

> P10: Well, for a little over half, so hopefully it'll be over soon. Quarter. So we're at 3 quarters.

Tyler: Yeah. What other information do you think the Va needs from you?

> P10: Well, they want an email and a phone number. So an email. So that's obvious. Yeah.

Tyler: Is there anything else you think we might see before the end of the form?

> P10: And let's see. So they have my name. They have my social security. Did they get my address? I can't remember.

Tyler: I'm not gonna answer your question yet. But do you think they need your address?

> P10: Probably.

Tyler: Why do you think they need your address?

> P10: Well, so they can continue to give me more selections of what's around my area.

Tyler: So they want you want it to make sure it's like location specific. For you. Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: If we compare this form to a maybe another form you've filled out in the past to contact a company or a bank or an organization. This feel the same amount of pages, or the same length, or or longer, or shorter

> P10: Well, I know right now it feels like it's a little longer, cause we're going piece by piece. Yeah, I think it would feel about the same.

Tyler: Okay, yeah. So you're recognizing obviously, us having a conversation while you do this is making it feel longer. But maybe in in a different setting, it would feel the same. Yep, okay, that makes sense. And now we're looking at this page. It says, your phone number and email.

Tyler: we can't fill these in with this prototype. But do you have any hesitation about what you'd what you're supposed to do on this page?

> P10: Well, the one thing I've noticed in past VA forms that I filled out, if I don't fill it out specifically the way they want it, it locks up. And the one thing I have is that they always put parentheses Xxx. Xx. Dash XXXX, XX. And I go right away and fill in my phone number. And the first thing that pops up is, it's not correct. so that's the one thing they need to spell it out, how they want it filled out.

Tyler: Yeah, that's really helpful. So in in other VA forms that you filled out, you remember that sometimes when you type in your phone number, it doesn't accept the the format.

> P10: Because I put in [# # #], dash [# # # # # #] (redacted), and that's it. No more dashes, and it links in right away. Not acceptable form.

Tyler: Right, okay. So you wish it would tell you if it's gonna not accept different phone formats, it needs to tell you the format? Yeah. So you notice here that it doesn't tell you the format an you automatically are like, well, now, I might type it in wrong.

Tyler: Yeah, that's really helpful.

Tyler: And why is it asking for your phone number? And email?

> P10: To get ahold of me.

Tyler: Okay, yeah. So they want to get a hold of you. So that feels clear that you would give both your phone number and your email. Okay, let's let's go ahead and click. Continue

> P10: Alright. Still 3 quarters.

00:39:53.900 --> 00:40:01.419

Tyler: Yeah. Still 3 quarters. And now what are we seeing here? Your contact? Preference?

> P10: Because they want to know how to contact you. And the one thing I've also noticed in typical government is they only allow you to pick one.  And to me, either by phone or email, is acceptable. And so I hope that there's more than one you could pick.

Tyler: Does it look like you can choose one or more than one?

> P10: It looks like you can only pick one.

Tyler: Okay, what makes you think you can only pick one?

> P10: Because it says, how should we contact you? Your contact preference. And then only says required. And it only looks like one.

Tyler: Okay, so you would, you ideally would choose phone and email. But it looks like this is gonna only let you choose one option. Okay, that's really helpful feedback.

Tyler: So you can, in fact, only choose one on this form. If you had to choose, would you choose phone or email?

> P10: Probably... Well, it's VA, probably email.

Tyler: Why do you say it's VA probably email?

> P10: Because on my phone, my iphone, I usually, if the you're not in the contacts, you're automatically going to voicemail and blocked.

Tyler: Okay, Gotcha. So you wanna make sure that you you would receive the right, the phone number phone call. And you wouldn't if their phone number is not saved. Okay, that makes sense. So emails a safer option because you don't know the phone number that's going to be calling you.

Tyler: And Who are you expecting to get an email from?

> P10: usually they send it va.gov, or somebody at va.gov or whatever. But usually I know it's from the VA or the VA, and you'll get that email from them.

Tyler: Okay, that's really helpful. So I know you'd usually choose email or even phone. And email. But for today. we're going to do something a little different. We're going to pretend like you'd prefer us mail. This is really just so we can test this website. So let's click on us mail. and then we'll just click, continue alright.

Tyler: alright, and then let me know what you're seeing here.

> P10: It's still 3 quarters. Country where you receive mail. (Laughs)

Tyler: Tell me why you're laughing here.

00:42:48.740 --> 00:43:00.450

> P10: Because I'm in the United States. I'm in the US, and I don't reside outside the United States or on a military base. So I would think that if they would say US mail they would know that it's already coming from the United States. Right?

Tyler: Okay. So on the last screen, you said Us mail. And now you're like, obviously, I'm in the United States.

> P10: They shouldn't be asking this.

Tyler: And are they asking for for your country or the country where the mail is coming from?

> P10:  So that's why I find it a little bit off tilt, why are they asking this?

Tyler: Right. It felt repetitive. Yeah, that's really helpful. What does this mean? Where it says, I received mail outside of the US.

> P10: Well, I would think. Well, the only thing I know is that there's a lot of Veterans in Costa Rica that I found on over the years. So what they're talking about?

Tyler: Yeah, okay, so not totally sure. But you think it might be like Veterans who live in Costa Rica as an example. Okay, cool. Well, let's let's choose United States. You can show me how you'd choose United States here.

> P10: We'll go down here. At least they have it at the top and not all the way down under U.

Tyler: Yeah, okay, so even though it kind of felt like it should be obvious, or you don't even need to ask this question. At least it was pretty quick to find United States. Right? Yeah, right? Yeah, that makes sense. That's good feedback.

Tyler: Let's click continue.

00:44:56.350 --> 00:44:57.320

> P10: - 1: Okay.

> P10: - 1: so we're still at 3 quarters.

00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:06.010

Tyler: Yeah. So we're still at 3 quarters. Is that is that kind of what you expect at this point?

> P10: I'd be find of feeling lik we're getting finished,

Tyler: Kind of feeling like it's ready to be to be done... And this is asking for your mailing address. Does this look standard? Does this look different to how you usually put your mailing address in?

> P10: Looks pretty standard.

> P10: It says we can't confirm your address.

00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:52.499

Tyler: Yeah. So what's it asking for you to do? 

> P10: Confirm your address? And then it would ask you which the one you entered in the suggested address.

> P10: So this is something that I found similar on us postal website. So it makes sense.

Tyler: Okay, so this is familiar from looking at the Usps website, it makes sense. Would you usually choose what you entered or the suggestion?

> P10: Suggestion.

Tyler: Okay, well, it looks like that's already chosen for you. So we'll click. Continue.

> P10:  Okay.

Tyler: So now, what are we seeing?

> P10: Editing answers.: And you are only able to edit some answers on this page, you may need to return it to an earlier page in the form to edit some answers. okay.

Tyler: Okay so what's the purpose of this page?

> P10:  I think it would be to verify what you're putting in.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense. Let's look at your category and topic.

> P10: Okay.

Tyler: What are we seeing here?

> P10: Healthcare and audiology. That's good. They got that right.

Tyler: They got that right. Okay, so that's that's what you're expecting to see. Okay.

Tyler: Can you change this?

> P10: I don't see anywhere to change it.

Tyler: So why are they showing you this?

> P10: To make sure what you're asking.

Tyler: Okay. Let's look at your question. And what are we seeing here?

> P10: Okay, my own own Va benefits. I have a question. And I want to have my hearing checked and possibly receive hearing aids, how do I go about this. They have another function in here. So maybe I need to verify something out of here hopefully, that would be what I would be able to edit.

Tyler: Okay, so hopefully, you'll be able to edit your question. Right? Okay. let's click on personal information. Let's look at that one.

Tyler: so just describe to me what we're looking at here.

> P10: Are you a VA employee. No. Name, preferred name, social security number, 1997, and write in an email, medical facility information to edit. That's good to be able to edit. That's good mailing address, able to edit. Yep.

Tyler: So you're saying, as you go through this, you're saying able to edit that, that's good. So you appreciate the ability to edit this information. Why is that?

> P10: Because you never know I've been something wrong.

Tyler: So it's helpful that while you're reviewing this, you can change something if you need to. Let's pretend like you noticed your phone number was entered incorrectly. Can you show me what you would do here?

> P10: Let's see. I would probably hit this. And hopefully will be allowing me to come in here and change this specifically.

Tyler: Why don't we click edit. so we won't be able to type. But is this is this kind of what you were thinking? You'd see. It sounds similar to what you described. Yeah, okay?

Tyler: And it also looks like we could edit our email here. Can we edit our our contact preference?

> P10: Let's see. No.

Tyler: Okay, I see where your mouse is. So we found where the contact preferences is. But it doesn't look like we can edit it right? Why do you think that is?

> P10: Because we made it that way in the old part or the other section?

Tyler: okay. So we we chose us mail before, and so we can't change it now. Okay.

Tyler: alright. Well, we'll click cancel. We'll just pretend like we didn't actually need to change anything. Yeah, that's perfect.

Tyler: And then we're just gonna submit your question. We're gonna say, we're all done. We're ready to send this to the VA.

Tyler: Now I'll give you a minute to read this page.

> P10: Okay, it's letting me know that the question was submitted successfully. And thanks me for submitting a question to the US department of Veterans Affairs. It gives me a reference number. which is what I would expect or from other websites. So that's a good thing. I've never seen that before. That's a good thing. So that way if the VA calls me or I call the VA, I can say I have a reference number for this problem. That's a good thing to have.

00:51:35.410 --> 00:51:38.299

Tyler: Okay. So the reference number is particularly helpful. Cause you can make sure you're talking about the same thing as the person on the phone. Yeah, okay.

> P10: And the one thing I'm not seeing on here, which would also be a good thing, usually on other websites and other, especially on, say, like the US Postal service or other government websites, it has a little section that says, you can print this page. What I would love to do is print that reference number. That would be beautiful.

00:52:47.470 --> 00:52:57.419

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense and if not, iif you couldn't print this page, how would you know that you? How would you save your reference? Number.

> P10: Well, it's Mac, so I would print the page. Anyway. (Lol).

> P10: I would have to write this reference number down on a piece of paper if I didn't have this capability. And if I lose the paper I'm out of luck.

Tyler: Right okay.

> P10: I would print it and put it into the folder. So I know where it's at.

Tyler: Okay, so you sound very organized. I'm also very organized. So I understand you wanting to to print this out and make sure you definitely have your reference number. And at this point in the process, what happens next?

> P10: Let's see. I would be expecting an email confirmation. And it's nice that they're letting me know that I will receive a reply within 7 business days. Which, usually with the VA, it takes about a week give or take.

Tyler: So that was kind of clear on what to expect next. So, [P10], I see we only have a few minutes left, and we've made it to the end of our prototype. So what we can do now is we can stop sharing our screen. So somewhere at the top of your screen, you're gonna see a bar and it'll say, stop sharing in red. You see that you can go ahead and click on that, and then you'll be able to see me.

Tyler: Perfect.

Tyler: ell, we've got a couple of minutes left, and I just I'd love to reflect on what we just did. And yeah, how how you found it. What did you think of that process?

> P10: I think it was a lot a lot easier than when I'm used to. I think it needs to be tweaked just a little bit. But otherwise I think it's it's a lot easier.

Tyler: And what are you comparing it to. When you say it's easier than what I'm used to?

> P10: It's just that, for giggles, so to speak. I went on the VABTSS website, which is for travel voucher and had the most horrible experience. There was no explanation on how to do anything on that webpage? Nothing. And that's probably why I signed up for this first place, because I totally messed that that up. And right now the poor travel voucher down in [City] is trying to figure out what happened. I put in travel vouchers like 7 times just to get it right. Finally. Now they have a whole bunch of other ones they're going through and throwing out.

> P10: So that's why it's just, the VA needs to realize that some people are computer literate. Some people use the computer. But if you don't put little things in to explain what to do, it's going to be a big mess.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. So your previous experience of trying to send the travel or apply for the travel voucher was way more complicated, and this felt maybe more descriptive?

> P10: Yes.

Tyler: Yeah, that that makes sense and sorry that you had that frustrating experience.

Tyler: Is there anything in the form in this form that we talked about today. That made it a little bit easier?

> P10: It's just that they made it a little bit more easier that you know what steps you're taking. You know how far you're in the steps, and you know what to do. And if there's a problem call. I hate when I have to do something with the VA and it says nothing.

> P10: That's what the BTSS did, it said nothing, and I don't know how that got about, because I have never been on a website so confusing.

Tyler: Yeah, so you like that, you know where to go if you need help you. You know what the page is about, what you need to do on the page, and then kind of how far you are in the process. That's really helpful.

Tyler: I just have kind of one more question, because I know we need to wrap up. But we talked about your progress through the form a couple of times when you would tell me – I think I'm about halfway done. I think I'm about 3 quarters of the way done. So that was kind of an estimate, right? Cause you didn't have a specific idea of what what step you were on. How did you feel about having an estimate versus having a specific step?

00:57:54.250 --> 00:57:59.090

> P10: I liked that it was an estimate, you know, and it felt good that while I was doing the steps I could see that I'm getting near the end, or I'm halfway. It felt like, okay, I'm getting somewhere. That's most important. When you're doing these forms, because people get bogged down doing them. And they don't know where they're at. And that helps.

Tyler: Right. It's a little bit like motivating to know just generally that you're you're moving forward in the form? Yeah.

Tyler: What makes sense. Well, [P10], I've asked you a ton of questions. I know we're kind of at time, but I want to leave some space in case you want to ask me any questions. I know this is your first time taking part in research. You can ask me questions about that or or anything else.

> P10: Nope, I think we hit the nail right on the head. I thank you very much for letting me do this.

Tyler: Oh, well, thank you. It was super helpful. And I hope you keep participating in in future research with the Va. Because your insight was really useful. You noticed lots of of different things that I didn't notice. And I really enjoyed chatting with you. Thank you.

Tyler: Awesome. Well, before you go, perigee, and they're the folks who set up this research session. They're gonna send you a thank you note, and they'll give you some information if you want to pass it on to other veterans in case they'd also like to sign up to to take part in research. If you have any, follow up questions, you can let them know. And otherwise. Yeah, I hope you have a lovely rest of your day.
