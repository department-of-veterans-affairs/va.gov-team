# P2 - January 24, 2024

## Transcript

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Tyler: Alright, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio today?

> P2: Sure.

Tyler: Awesome. Well, thank you so much. We've got through all of the beginning part of the session pretty quickly. But before we jump into the prototype, I just wanna get to know you a little bit better and how you have experienced VA services.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000

Tyler: How long have you been a veteran?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000

> P2: I was medically retired back in 2014. Later this year will be 10 years.

Tyler: And did you start interacting with the VA right when you were medically retired? Right away or only in the last few years?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000

> P2: Yeah, right away. I need, well, I'm better now, but I needed a lot of medical care. First, I'm in the wheelchair. I'm an amputee above the knee. And spinal injuries, burns, a bunch of, bunch of stuff.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000

Tyler: So you get a lot of regular care.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000

> P2: Yeah. So right away got enrolled in health care and started using VA services.

Tyler: Yeah, thanks. That's helpful to understand a little bit more of that context.

Tyler: In the last 10 years, have you contacted the VA online or over the phone or is most of you interaction?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000

> P2: Many times.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:37.000

Tyler: Yeah. Okay. Do you wanna tell me maybe about one of the experiences of contacting the VA?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:46.000

> P2: Well for a long time it was mainly for medical stuff, trying to make appointments or refill medications or asking questions, medical related. Recently well – I'm still doing that but – when I was active duty, I gave my GI bill to my son, my kids. And my son is going, my oldest son is going to start college next summer. So I'm trying to use the VA, you know, the GI Bill part, you know, to give it to my son. And I have a lot of issues from the VA now with that. I don't know what part of you call that – it's not the medical part of the VA is the, you know, benefits, educational benefits side of it.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000

Tyler: Yeah. So it sounds like you've got all sorts of experience with the VA.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:42.000

> P2: Well, first, you know, I call and I read online, you know, how to submit, you know, a claim to use my GI Bill benefits. And they go online so I try to do that but first, you need an account with the VA. And for the GI bill benefits, the student needs to apply, the beneficiary. Well the first problem I had with the VA, you need to be 18 to be able to register. My son is still 17. He will still be 17 when he starts college. And I think it's a stupid rule, especially for the education stuff for dependents, that we cannot do it because he's not 18 yet. Cause I'm pretty not the only one and that's situation. We cannot do it because he's not 18.

> P2: Also to be able to sign up and register your own account online - besides being 18 – you need to give the VA a proof of ID, a state ID. Usually I guess their thinking about driving license. Well, my song is kind of a nerd. He doesn't drive. He doesn't have any driving license. He has no interest with driving at this point. So he doesn't have any state ID. His only ID is a US passport. An ID from the federal government. And the VA doesn't take it. On the list of acceptable ID, they only take state ID. That doesn't make any sense. So we couldn't apply for its benefits for these main two reasons, he is not 18 yet and he doesn't have a state ID only a passport.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000

Tyler: Right.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:45.000

> P2: So I did it on my login. I filled out his information for him. Because he's still a minor, so I need to actually sign for him because he's not 18 yet. And then some moron at the VA got this form. And then a couple weeks later they mailed me back the a letter in the mail. Saying congratulations for going to college blah blah blah and you know you have that many more GI Bill benefits. But they put everything under my name, like, me going to college, not my son. Like dumb ass. And we've been stuck since then.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:17.000

Tyler: Right. Right, yeah. Yeah, that sounds super frustrating. Yeah, that sounds like a very frustrating experience and I wish that it was something that I could help more with today. But that's probably unliklely.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000

> P2: Yeah so I don't know if on your side if you have a section for stuff that needs to change like policy change for the VA . Like this dependents thing. Doesn't make any sense that they don't take a federal ID and that you have to be 18. There's a bunch of kids sometimes even younger than 17 and go to college.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:47.000

Tyler: Yeah. And you're talking specifically about setting up. And the login account is the problem, right?

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000

> P2: Yeah, well at first we could not log in. And I said, and then I did it on the model again. Because of the ID. And they didn't even read what I wrote because I wrote it's not for me. It's for my son, but they send me back the approval later. You know, my name, just like I was the one going to college.

Tyler: Yeah, that's really frustrating. I don't want us to get too sidetracked, but another option. There might be another option for signing in where you can use a passport and then your son could do it through his account. So I'll share that with you at the end of the session. But for today, I'm gonna move this along just in the interest of time.

Tyler: I really appreciate you sharing that with me and I'm sorry that it's happening.

Tyler: A lot of what our focus of our conversation today is gonna be on the actual experience of contacting the VA. And it sounds like you have a lot of experience with that. We're gonna be talking about contacting the VA online.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:42.000

Tyler: Basically the service we're working on, it exists right now and we're trying to make it better. So any of your feedback from past experiences or from what you're looking at today will be really helpful.

> P2: Okay.

Tyler: So I'm gonna send you a link to a prototype. Like I mentioned. I'm just gonna send this as a link in our chat on Zoom. Just let me know when you've got it opened. It might take a minute to load.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000

> P2: Yeah, I need to open that link?

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000

Tyler: Yes, please.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:17.000

> P2: Figma.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000

Tyler: Yeah, so once you have Figma opened let me know and then we're gonna... 

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000

> P2: Yeah, it's open.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000

Tyler: Awesome. And have you shared your screen on Zoom before?

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000

> P2: Probably.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:36.000

Tyler: Okay, if you come back to Zoom, if you go to the bottom of your Zoom window, there's a green button that says share screen. You see that? Oh, perfect. Yep, now so now I'm able to see what you're seeing.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000

> P2: Well, yeah. Okay.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000

Tyler: It looks like it's a VA website. And it says Ask VA at the top.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000

> P2: Yeah.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:22.000

Tyler: Awesome. Alright, so we're not gonna click on anything yet, but I'm gonna give you a moment to look at this page and I'd love for you to tell me what you're noticing first.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000

> P2: First, Ask VA. And then, I guess you need to sign in or create an account. You should receive a respond within 7 business days. Which is like pretty new and usually, well, depending who you email or whatever, but... you never get answers. Well, it's either, you know, usually right away within a couple of days. Or they never get back to you, ever.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:13.000

Tyler: Right, okay. So the first things you noticed are that it says Ask VA, it looks like you need to sign in. And then it says the response in 7 days. Yeah.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000

> P2: I would change here Ask the VA because we don't call VA is not the name of somebody. We never say I'm going to VA, we say I'm calling the VA. Think "the" should be there as "the VA."

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:40.000

Tyler: Right. Yeah, I totally hear you on that.

Tyler: So for the rest of our conversation, we're gonna pretend like you need to ask the VA a question. So let's say you've recently noticed you have some problems with your hearing. This is just a made up scenario for today.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000

> P2: Actually, it's true!

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:57.000

Tyler: Okay, so you have some problems with your hearing and you wanna ask the VA how to get your hearing checked by an audioologist.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000

> P2: Okay.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.000

Tyler: Okay. So if that was your question, and you wanted to ask the VA, what would you do next? Can you show me on this screen?

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000

> P2: So I guess, first here [green alert], they talk about if it's a question about education benefits. Like the GI Bill or Work study. But if it's about hearing, there's no hing about that. So I guess I would have to sign here [blue sign in button].

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000

Tyler: Okay, got it. So we're not gonna click on anything yet, but that's really helpful. It sounds like the green box is not relevant because your question is about hearing. So then the next button you found is this blue one here.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000

> P2: Yeah, I guess.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000

Tyler: Yeah, okay. And does it seem like you need to sign in in order to ask your question?

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:51.000

> P2: Yeah. Well, you can do it without signing. But from my experience... when you call they always ask for your last name and social security number. If you ask a general question, then they always say, I need to be specific. They never answer general questions. I did it before, they just refer you to the website. Just like general information. But any kind of specifics, they want to know who you are.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.000

Tyler: Yeah. So you're relying on your past experience, which tells you you would probably prefer to sign in.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000

> P2: Yeah.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000

Tyler: That makes a lot of sense. For today, we're just gonna go ahead and click continue without signing in. We're gonna pretend like we don't need to sign in. And I mentioned earlier your question is about getting your hearing checked. Can you show me what you would do on this page?

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000

> P2: I would click here. And I guess it will be part of healthcare.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:49.000

Tyler: Okay, that felt really quick for you. So we'll just sit on this page for a minute here. That felt really quick for you to choose healthcare. When you were choosing that, option.

Tyler: Yeah, perfect. Let's stay here for just one moment. So we're not able to click. We won't click anything yet and we'll just talk about this page. So. When you chose healthcare, how important did you think it was to answer this question correctly?

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:16.000

> P2: Well, it was by elimination. I forget... Well, what was the other 3 options? One was like disability compensation, whatever. It's not an issue. I was rated 100% first time up with the VA. And honestly, I believe the people appealing and bitching all the time about the VA, all the fakers. Like everybody I know, actually, you know, amputees is you know, actually disabled. We got approved by the VA first time up. The people who are appealing, appealing because they're not disabled, they just fake it. Yeah, my personal opinion here.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000

Tyler: Right. Okay. So you're using your process of elimination and healthcare made sense.

> P2: And then, I forget what was the 2 other options, but what was it again?

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:06.000

Tyler: Yeah there's actually a longer list of options, but lets... what we'll do is we'll go to the next page. We'll click continue. And then this question is similar. Can you tell me how this is different?

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000

> P2: So, if I'm calling to get hearing aid stuff, the first one here. You don't need to read anything else. Okay. Ah, that's what I need, you know. Hearing aids here, hearing test.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:32.000

Tyler: Right. Okay. And how is this question different to the last one you just answered?

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:41.000

> P2: Well, the other one was more really general. Here is a bit more specific and the options are... there's more options.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:48.000

Tyler: Right. Okay. Let's click on audiology and hearing aids, like you said.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000

Tyler: We're gonna go back one screen.

> P2: I'm a quick clicker.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:14:00.000

Tyler: Yeah, so there's another thing I'm noticing on this page in this gray box. Can you tell me what that is?

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000

> P2: You're required to click one of those. Let's say you're calling for – one of my things now – is I need to get a trust fund of my labor set up. I don't see anything about that here. And there's no option to have other or what. It's a limited list of stuff. Plus there's stuff that has nothing to do with – I clicked first on the health care department. And then here, career opportunities. If you want to find a job don't go on the VA website go to USA jobs. That has nothing to do here. Here caregiver has nothing to do here, it's not my health care. Eligibility too. A lot of this stuff here, besides prosthetics which I use a lot of that stuff, has nothing do with general health care departments.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:17.000

Tyler: Okay, so it feels weirdly specific and some things that maybe are not as useful to you are in this list.

> P2: Well, it shouldn't be here for most of it, besides prosthetics. Everything else should be on a different website, not here on the list.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000

Tyler: Right.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:36.000

> P2: I have a question about health care. It means health care for the Veteran. Not working as a nurse for the VA, that's something totally different. Not the caregiver. Not the how to apply with VA, pretty different. Family member health benefits, that's benefit stuff, it's not health care per se. When I read health care here, it's health care for the Veteran. Like Foreign Medical Program I have no idea what it is. Maybe this [Getting care at a local VA medical center] you can leave it. Prosthetics makes sense, it's one of the departments under health care. Vet centers. It's not part of the VA. There's a ton of privately run or state run Vet centers. I don't think it should be there.

> P2: And then women services. Ah. Maybe can stay there, but you know, just, put gynecology or whatever, the woman stuff. But also put, you know, prostate screening then and all the stuff for men too. If you put women stuff, put stuff for everybody.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:57.000

Tyler: Okay, so thank you for reacting to everything in the list that was helpful. I think I'm understanding like, it's clear to you that you've chose healthcare and then after that it needs to get more specific but it doesn't feel like this list aligns with what you would expect here.

Tyler: So that's really helpful. Let's go ahead and move on to the next page. We're going to click continue and then we're not going to click continue and then we're not going to click anything yet. So remember your question is about getting how you get your hearing checked. Can you tell me what you would do on this page?

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000

> P2: I would click, since it's for me, my own VA benefits I guess.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:30.000

Tyler: Okay. And then if you were, asking a question, maybe about your son. Maybe we're talking about your confusion with the GI Bill and how he can apply and everything else. Which one would you choose?

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000

> P2: Someone else's VA benefits, but it will not be under health care, it would be first benefits, education benefits.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:45.000

Tyler: Right. Yes. Yeah, good point. Okay, so those options and how they're different makes sense. What about it's a general question. Can you imagine when you might use that option?

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:59.000

> P2: Here I'm trying to get an appointment to get a hearing test. If it's more, I don't really know, a general question that doesn't apply to me specifically. But I don't know. Something really general. You would click that.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:20.000

Tyler: Okay, yeah, that feels clear. Before we continue to the next page, how much longer do you think this form is going to be?

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:26.000

> P2: Before I actually can get the answer or like my question?

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000

Tyler: Yeah, either one, just I guess walk me through your expectation.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000

> P2: I guess there's 4 questions, it says 2 of 4 here.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000

Tyler: Okay, so you feel like you're on the second question and there's gonna be 2 more questions.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000

> P2: Yeah.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000

Tyler: Okay, what do you think is gonna happen after this question? What do you think it's gonna ask you?

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000

> P2: I don't know.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000

Tyler: Okay. That's all good. Alright, well let's continue. Let's see what we find on the next page. Alright, so we won't click on anything yet. Tell me what you're seeing on this page. Can you describe this?

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:09.000

> P2: Reason you're contacting us. I don't think... It's a stupid page or stupid question, it already asks, since page one you have a question. I have a specific question about health care. And here again. Yes, I have a question again. And I want to say something nice. Nobody is going to say something nice here. I like this kind of stuff is like maybe after when you go to a survey or something like that. If you email someone or talk to somebody. That's where this should go after you've been taken care of and you can do a survey.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000

Tyler: Got it.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:49.000

> P2: Oh yeah, this person at the VA was really helpful. She can't give a shit and you know, I will complain. That would be kind of survey questions after everything is done. Like here, I want to say something. Well, I want to say something. I have a question. Okay. So this page is still, I think, useless and stupid. That's why you're on this website because you have a question. Not to get my hearing aid or hearing test. So this waste of time and it's a bunch of stupid questions that shouldn't be here.

> P2: And also it says page 2 before I click nexted on top and it's still page 2 of 4. I didn't keep track of the questions, but should be at least 3 or 4 now. Still 2 here. So. Okay.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:48.000

Tyler: Right. That's really helpful. There's a lot that you've said, so I'm just gonna digest it all.

Tyler: It sounds like this question feels out of place. You called it kind of stupid and like unnecessary and particularly because this is the service where you've come to ask a question. So it feels like an obvious thing. I also think it was interesting how you said this feels like something that would happen at the end, almost like a customer service kind of survey. That's really helpful. And then the last thing you noticed was the steps didn't change, which is confusing because you expected it to say 3 or 4.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000

> P2: Yeah.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:18.000

Tyler: Awesome. Thank you for that. So let's choose I have a question. And then we're gonna click continue.

> P2: Okay. Okay. Here we're still on 2 of 4. This thing is not moving.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:29.000

Tyler: Right, okay, so that's continuing to be confusing or frustrating, maybe, because it's not changing.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:35.000

Tyler: And now we're on this page and what would you expect to do here? We're not actually going to click on this page or type.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:43.000

> P2: Okay, well. How can I get some appointment to get my hearing test?

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000

Tyler: You would type that in here? Okay, is there anything on this page that it feels confusing or this feels pretty straightforward?

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000

> P2: No, no, it's to the point, that's my question. Okay, I like it.

Tyler: Yeah. So it feels clear what to do and you would put in your question here. If we think about the process overall, does this feel like the right time to put in your question?

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.000

> P2: Sure.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:20.000

Tyler: Okay, great. Well, let's go ahead and pretend like we typed in your question. We'll just imagine we typed it in. And then we're gonna click continue. And now we're on this page. Can you show me which option you would choose on this page?

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:45.000

> P2: Finally, change 3 of 4. Number 2, there was like 4 questions, 4 pages, for 2 of yeah.

> P2:  Yeah, well, it's asking if I'm the Vet or I'm a family member.

Tyler: Which option would you choose?

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000

> P2: And that thing... I already answered that before, one of the first page. I remember.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:09.000

Tyler: Okay. So it feels like you've already answered this. Is there anything else you, oh, okay, we'll move on to this page. We can stay here. That's fine. Alright, what would you do on this page?

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.000

> P2: VA employee, it's easy. Are you a VA employee. But why this is over there? Doesn't have any relevance to the questino or your situation. This shouldn't be here. Because you're a Veteran. I'm trying to get an appointment here for a hearing aid. A hearing test. What does that have to do with whether I work for the VA or not? There are some VA employees that are Veterans, but this shouldn't be a question here. I don't know why they asking this. This has nothing to do with the question of being a Veteran. I can be, you know, working as a Veteran for the VA or for, you know, whoever. That you know has nothing to do with this your benefits, you know? Being a veteran, there's no blame, but you know, being a VA employee. And why do they want to know that here, because it means, oh, if you're the employee instead of waiting 6 months to get an answer then you answer you right away? That would be discrimination. This shouldn't be here. Period.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:41.000

Tyler: Okay, yeah, so that feels really clear. You definitely don't feel like this question should be in the form.

> P2: It's like why do you want to know if I work for the VA or not. That has nothing to do with the questions and the situation.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000

Tyler: Yeah. So even though it's a straightforward question for you to answer, it's almost frustrating that this is in the form.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:04.000

> P2: Yeah, plus once you have it's yes or no, you don't have the option to, you know, refuse to answer or doesn't apply or whatever.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:11.000

Tyler: Yeah, right. Can you show me what you would do on this page?

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.000

> P2: Well, I put no just to move on. But yeah. This is like, putting me off, why are they asking that, you know, it was like nothing to do with the questions and my health care. The website set up an appointment.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000

Tyler: Right. Yeah. So you're starting to get a little bit frustrated with some of the questions.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000

> P2: That – I have never seen it in my whole life. They never asked me if I work for the VA or not, but that shouldn't be there. I don't know who came up with that question. That doesn't make any sense.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:55.000

Tyler: Yeah, I think that's fair. Let's go ahead and click continue. We'll see what's on the next page.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:04.000

> P2: Okay. Here again. Remember the model of the first page? It was like either you sign in, you know, or you continue without signing in. But so, if you don't sign in, why do they want all that information? It's like when I told you when you call and they ask your name and your social, every time. They won't talk to you without that information, even if it's a general question. And like, where's the nearest VA facility? Really general doesn't involve any personal information. I only get to talk to you if I give you a name and your social and birth date, I guess. 

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:45.000

Tyler: Right, okay, so it feels like you chose not to sign in so they should ask for less of this information.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:57.000

> P2: Yeah, but if I want to get in there then I guess I have to play the game and so my name here, date of birth. And here [pronouns] required, hell no. That's woke bullshit here. No, thank you.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000

Tyler: So what would you do if, if you didn't want to answer that question?

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.000

> P2: Well, first remove the required and remove the stuff. That doesn't make any sense, you know.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000

Tyler: Yeah, so imagine that this was how the page was and –

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000

> P2: And ze/zirs, I've never seen that.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:30.000

Tyler: How would you respond? So we can't change the question. How would you respond in that case?

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:40.000

> P2: Well, since I told you they still need to know your name and social to answer, I'd keep that part. [But pronouns] shouldn't be there. Stupid question. That's nothing to do with even being a Veteran, you know, it's so wokeness, indoctrination here. And to force us to pick one of those, I don't want any of those. So I would, well, here. I would choose my preferred name.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.000

Tyler: Okay. So that's what you would do because you don't have a choice.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:07.000

> P2: And I even don't know what they mean. You know, you have my name, your name is your name, it's whatever you enter here, first name, last name, that's your name.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:17.000

Tyler: Yeah. Okay, so we've noticed a couple things on this page. Definitely frustration about having to have the pronouns required. And before, that, if we scroll up a little bit, there was one thing I just wanted to look at a little bit more closely. You mentioned social security number. So if we're looking, at the social security number section. Do you have any hesitation about putting your social security number in?

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:52.000

> P2: Well, you have no choice. I guess I'm assuming it's an encrypted, secure, you know, website.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:29:03.000

Tyler: Right. And it sounds like from your experience of contacting them before this is something that the VA asks for.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000

> P2: Yeah. Yeah, every time. Date of birth, Social Security, or last 4. Service number that would be for really old Veterans. I don't recall the exact date, but I think since the sixties, or before that, the military was issuing a service number. But since I think sixties, your service number and your social security number is the same. You don't have 2 numbers. So that would be for really very old veterans like World War 2 or maybe Korea. I'm not sure exactly when that switched, but, so they can keep that.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:43.000

Tyler: Okay, so that one it feels clear to you that you would either give your social security number or your service number, right?

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000

> P2: Right.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:51.000

Tyler: Okay, that's all I was going to ask on that one. So why don't we go ahead and scroll down. And we're gonna go ahead and click continue.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:03.000

> P2: Okay, another thing that shouldn't be there... it's like I'm asking, for a hearing appointment. This shit is like, I don't care what people, who they sleep with, you know, what they do in the bedroom or whatever. But why are you asking that to everybody, every question, like that's not relevant? There's nothing to do with who you are and and the service here. This is all bullshit that you know that force down on you all the time.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:30.000

Tyler: Okay, yeah, so very similar reaction to the pronouns field and it feels particularly frustrating because it's not relevant to your question.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:38.000

> P2: Yeah, and I don't care if you are like a transgender or whatever, but why first why do you want to know? If it means okay, I'm a women, it means you don't treat me? I say I'm transgender and it means you're not going to see me because I'm transgender? Just don't ask. Like don't ask don't tell. I don't care what you do. You know, what dress you wear, who you sleep with. But again, here I would say, well, at least it has the option, prefer not to answer.

> P2: But I'm just trying to get an appointment. Why I need to spend, you know, a lot of time answering stupid questions. Get to the point. How do I get an appointment for my hearing aid? That's the thing here.

Tyler: Right. Okay, so lots of frustration with questions that feel irrelevant to what you're trying to do here.

Tyler: Let's go ahead and click continue. We're gonna pretend like you filled in that page. And now can you describe to me what we're looking at here?

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:39.000

> P2: Well it says my VA Medical Center. Either the name or the location.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:48.000

Tyler: Okay, so we're not gonna click on anything yet, but can you tell me what search by name means?

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:57.000

> P2: Well, I would say, like you put you know, the name of the city. Los Angeles Medical Center. Or I don't know, New York VA or whatever. You put the name of the city or whatever.

> P2: Hopefully it works because a lot of places, the actual name of the VA hospital is not the name of the city, it's the name of someone.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.000

Tyler: Right. Yeah, I know what you mean. And what about search by location? What does that mean?

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:24.000

> P2: Well, there you just put the zip code or the name of the city would work here.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:33.000

Tyler: Okay, yeah, so we're not gonna click on anything yet, but which one would you usually choose to use? Would you search by name or would you search by location?

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:47.000

> P2: Because it's the first thing showing up here I would just put – that's what I was telling you – that's the actual name of the hospital, which nobody knows what they are. We all say the name of the city or the location. You know, I'm sure people in Tampa don't say, oh, I'm going to the James Haley Hospital. It's, I'm going to the Tampa VA. or whatever. I'm going to the VA.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000

Tyler: Right. Yeah. Okay, so let's pretend like your VA is James J. Peters. So you typed in James, what would you do next on this page?

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.000

> P2: Well, you see, so I'm in the Bronx. The Peters you mentioned is here.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000

Tyler: Okay, so would you click on that? Or?

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:33.000

> P2: Oh, I would click on this. And again, it would make more sense to put the name of the city. Cause that's what we use. And you cannot like, well here it's a short list, but if you don't know, like, honestly, I'm going to the Dallas VA. I have no idea what's the actual name. I really say Dallas. It probably is the name of somebody too. I don't know who. So I need to go through the old alphabet and go through 300, you know, VA locations to maybe find it.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000

Tyler: Okay, that feels really clear to me. So the names of the facilities are kind of a bit odd and it's easier.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000

> P2: Nobody knows that. Nobody use it.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:15.000

Tyler: Right. And it's easier for you to search by the location.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000

> P2: You know, the people working there, I'm sure there would be a nurse or doctor working at the Tampa VA. And they're going to say I work at the Tampa VA.

Tyler: Totally. Yeah. I hear you on that. Let's click on James J. Peters. And then we're seeing this list now. So if James J. Peters was your health facility, what would you do next?

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000

> P2: Continue.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:47.000

Tyler: Okay, let's click on continue. Okay, so now we're looking at this page here.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000

> P2: And that's a lot of pages, but we should see here is not 3 or 4, it's like 10 of 14 or something.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:35:00.000

Tyler: Yeah, let's just talk about that for a second. So how much longer do you think this form will be?

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.000

> P2: I don't know, I thought it was 4 pages, but we did a lot more than this and my patience is running down.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:13.000

Tyler: Yeah, I can see that. And if you compare this form to a similar form that you've filled out for maybe a different company or maybe for the VA. Does this feel shorter or longer?

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:23.000

> P2: Longer. It's like, get to the point. Okay now, phone number and email address. I guess I need to answer that. So they can reply back to me. Contact me back with the information.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:47.000

Tyler: Right. So although this question makes sense to you, like they need to be able to contact you, you've had to answer other questions before that were like a little bit frustrating and unnecessary.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.000

> P2: Yeah.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000

Tyler: So at this point you're frustrated. Yeah, I can see that. So for this page, we're not gonna fill this out, but it does this feel straightforward?

00:35:50.000 --> 00:36:01.000

> P2: You would put your phone number in email.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000

Tyler: Okay let's go ahead and continue. And then without clicking anything on this page, can you tell me which option you would normally choose?

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:13.000

> P2: Yeah. For the email. And the reason is, you know, when they call you, if, you know, for whatever reason and you can be you know in the bathroom or you don't hear the phone or whatever, you know. And they'll leave a message. But the person calling you, they always leave the general phone number for... There's so many times I'm in this situation. Somebody calls me, they leave a message, and say oh we need to schedule you for something call back that number and when you call back, first you have the answering machine for, you know, click this for this and 2 for this and 5 for this. That's for a while and then it always goes to a dispatcher who's going maybe, after you're waiting, 45 min online, takes a message for you. There's actually no way to call back a provider directly. And I will talk to even the VA patient advocate and he said, oh yeah, we don't... We call people, but they always give a general number for you to call back.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000

Tyler: Right. That's very frustrating.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.000

> P2: And it's kind of impossible to reach the person just left you a message. Because they never leave their direct phone number. Never. And they say it's against the policy. I don't know why. Doesn't make any sense. And that's why, you know, I put email. Because phone if you don't pick up the phone the first time up there's no way to contact them back.

> P2: And email hopefully is faster than US mail. Wow, the mail is so slow and you know, every day I get mailed for somebody else. I don't know. And I'm sure my mail is going to some other houses.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:59.000

Tyler: Right, yes, I totally get that. Alright, well, it sounds like you would choose email.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.000

> P2: Yeah.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:06.000

Tyler: It would be a straightforward choice for you. For today, we're gonna have you choose US mail and this is just for the purpose of testing the website. I know that's not what you would normally choose. So we'll click continue. And then we're seeing this page and can you tell me your reaction to this page?

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:20.000

> P2: Country where you receive mail. Well, first shouldn't it be assumed that it's in the US? I don't know the number, but probably 99% of Veterans live in the US. And so by default it should be the US. Then if you live in the Philippines or somewhere else, then at the bottom you should have an option. 'Oh, if you don't live in the US. Well, here, select the country where, where you live.' But by default, US should be there on top and you shouldn't answer the question.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:59.000

Tyler: Yeah. Okay, let's choose United States. I totally understand.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.000

> P2: Waste of time again. Like I said, 99% people, they live in the United States. Why do they need to click on living in the states? Should be obvious, you know, should be by default.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000

Tyler: Right. Yeah, that makes sense. Most people....

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:21.000

> P2: And then if you, you know, US without clicking on it and then get this, you know, I receive mail outside of the US. Or in another country, but that is an option on the bottom. For the you know the one person maybe we don't live here.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000

Tyler: Right. Okay. Yeah, I hear you. So it should be the default. And now we're gonna click continue. And we're looking at this page which is asking for your, mailing address. Does anything here stand out to you? Maybe different from other forms you filled out like this?

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:56.000

> P2: Okay, well, yeah, first. That's the Canadian format here. You know, I used to live in Canada before. You just said you live in the United States so it should be in the United States format. We have no province or region in the US and there's no postal code, we call that zip code in the US. This should be re-worded.

> P2: Plus, I decided to ask a question without signing in. That means I didn't want to give my information. But so far, you know, already a bunch of personal information. And now they also want my mailing address on top of everything else already. Well. And I know I requested to be contacted by US mail. So they need my address. But yeah.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.000

Tyler: Yeah, no, I hear you though. It's frustrating that you're having to give all this information.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:43.000

> P2: The format feels like it's not US.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:55.000

> P2: Yeah, street. Okay, also there's more than street. What about boulevard, avenue, place, square, lane. You know? And I don't know how it works, but sometimes like where I work, where I live, it's a place, it's not called street, place. And it's like, websites, they don't take it, they want the street. Just the street. And what about avenues, place, lane and othe rthings. 

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:17.000

Tyler: Yeah, I see. Why don't we go ahead and click continue? I see that we're getting closer towards the end of the session.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:23.000

> P2: Okay. Just province, region that's not in the US. That's not what people call it here.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:31.000

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. And then what is this page asking for? We won't click on anything but what is this page asking you to do?

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:41.000

> P2: We're assuming that's I entered, you know, the top one here as my mailing address and they say, oh should it be something else.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:56.000

Tyler: Yeah. And what do you normally do? Have you seen this before on a website?

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.000

> P2: Yeah, a lot of times. Usually I click suggested address. If it's the same thing, you know. Maybe there's actually no South. I don't know. But. So here I will leave it the way and just continue.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:16.000

Tyler: Okay, great. You can go ahead and click continue. Alright, so on this page we're not going to click anything yet. The prototype is gonna work a little funny with what you can click on. But if you just have a look, can you describe this page to me? What's the purpose of this page?

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:29.000

> P2: Review and submit. It says I can review and edit some of the answers here. But not all of them. Maybe some you want to change, you need to go back and start from scratch, I guess.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:48.000

Tyler: Okay. Yeah, that's helpful. So we'll open your category and topic. And can you tell me what you're seeing here? Does this information feel familiar? Is this what you expected?

00:42:53.000 --> 00:43:03.000

> P2: Yeah, first page – one of the first ones – my question is about health care. More specifically, yeah, audiology and hearing aids.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:12.000

Tyler: Okay. Let's go ahead and click personal information. So we'll skip your question and we're just gonna have a brief look at this. Would you normally review your information here before you submit?

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:21.000

> P2: Yeah, well, usually I go really quickly.

Tyler: Yeah, just skimming. And let's say you were looking at this and you saw that your phone number was entered incorrectly. What would you do here?

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:33.000

> P2: Here. Try to, in here, contact information.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000

Tyler: Okay, yeah, let's click on edit.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.000

> P2: And then change it.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000

Tyler: Yeah, okay. So you change your phone number. That feels pretty straightforward.

Tyler: It looks like you can also change your email. Is there anything else you can change in this section?

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000

> P2: No that's it, phone number and email.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:55.000

Tyler: Yeah, what about your contact preference? Can you change how the VA contacts you?

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.000

> P2: I doesn't show up here, I guess not. I click update here.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:15.000

Tyler: We can click, we'll click cancel. We'll pretend like we didn't need to change it and then, we're gonna go ahead and scroll down and we're just gonna submit the question. Okay, perfect. So. Now we're on this page. I'm gonna give you a few minutes to just read this page.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000

> P2: Okay.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:42.000

Tyler: Okay, so, can you just summarize what you've read to me?

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:54.000

> P2: It says my question was submitted successfully. I have a reference number. And I should also receive an email confirmation. I guess I submitted my questions and I should receive an email through US mail since I've requested US mail within 7 business days. And if they need more information, they will contact me.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:16.000

Tyler: Yeah. So based on what you read here, what do you expect, to happen next?

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:24.000

> P2: To receive a letter from them in the mail. In 7 business days which, I doubt it. First, you know, even if I send, you know, a regular thing in the mail here. Or somebody else, you know, 5 streets away in the same city, that might get it in about a week. And I don't know where the mail is coming from, but the mail is more slow, you know, slower every week. There's always sometimes good excuses, all the weather is too cold, too hard, this snow, it's raining or whatever but for them to, you know, read my questions, find an answer, type it, put it in the mail. And then USPS to bring it to my house within 7 days. It's great if it's real, but I don't.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:14.000

Tyler: Right. Okay, so we're doubtful about how long this is gonna take. Otherwise, it feels kind of straightforward for what's going to happen next. Is there any information on this page that's missing? Is there anything you'd need to know after you submit your question that you don't know yet?

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.000

> P2: Hmm, no.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:37.000

Tyler: Okay. So I know that you wouldn't normally choose US mail as your contact method. So let's say you chose email, which is what you would normally choose. So it says that you should receive a reply via email within 7 business days.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000

> P2: Yeah, that would make more sense. That would make more sense. The timing would make more sense. Because you know they still need to research and find the answer and once they type it in the email, it takes just a few seconds to reach me. Versus, in the mail it takes a while.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:10.000

Tyler: Yeah. And if you received the email, so let's say it's been 7 business days, the VA gets back to you and they're like, this is how you get your hearing checked and they describe it to you. And something wasn't clear to you, and you wanted to follow up and ask another question. How would you expect to follow up?

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:27.000

> P2: Well, one thing, I hope it's somebody sending me an email with the answer. And if I have questions about the answer on their email, I can email them back asking for an explanation or further questions. What I hate is like when a bunch of people, companies or doctors that send you something. And it's always a no reply @ something. And they don't put the contact information in their email. And it's like you have questions about what I just send you. I mean, there's no way to ask questions to no one. Cause you cannot reply back. It's no reply @ something, you know, email address. And there's no contact information in their email.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:05.000

Tyler: Yeah. Right. Yeah, so you really want to be able to have the opportunity to reply.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.000

> P2: Yeah, I hope the email they send me, it's from somebody. You know, that I can email back, reply with questions if I have to. And their contact information. And not some, you know, computer generated email that you cannot reply and also not contact information and general. A general answer. It has to be from someone.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000

Tyler: Yeah, it's an important that it's not like generic information. You know who the person is and that you can reply back to them like kind of a human conversation. Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: Well, I think I've asked all the questions I have about this page. So you can actually stop sharing your screen at this point. There should be a little button. Kind of towards the top of your page that's red.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.000

Tyler Perfect. And I see we've got about 8 mins left, so I just want to spend the last 8 mins kind of reflecting on that process. We've talked a little bit about it but it sounds like the form was maybe a bit longer than you'd expected. There was a couple questions in there that you very clearly did not like or felt like they were unnecessary. And that was really helpful feedback. Is there anything about the process that you did like? Is there anything we should make sure that we keep?

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:31.000

> P2: Well, still good if you have the actual option to ask a question online. Like I said, when you call, there's no way to talk to someone. And you're waiting, you're waiting, you have the answering machine forever and Press one for this and 2 for this. And then also a stupid recording. Oh, we experiencing a user higher than usual, you know, volume of coal. Your call is important to us. No, it's not important. If it's important, you pick up the phone. And it's bullshit, as the same recording for the last 20 years. Yeah, no, it's, I think everybody hates these recording and the music forever. And then your call is really important to us. It's like, it's not just the VA, you call the bank or businesses. Customer serve is number one priority. Your call is really important to us. Please hold. No, it's not important. Say this, you would pick up the code. And maybe, yeah, you can wait a couple of minutes. Maybe there's another person, but it's all the time. You can call in the morning, midlde of the night is always the same recording. And you always wait forever for somebody to pick up the phone.

> P2: And then hopefully here, the VA, it's somebody in the states picking up the phone. When you called private companies somebody in Pakistan on the Philippines will answer the phone. You're not in the US anymore.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:55.000

Tyler: Okay. Yeah. So in theory, you like the idea of being able to contact the VA online because you can avoid some of the hassle of contacting people over the phone that you just described. But it sounds like you still have a maybe hesitation with contacting the VA online. Is there another way that you prefer to contact the VA? So if we can't contact them over the phone or online? Is there another way that you can imagine that might be better for you?

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:16.000

> P2: What I do most of the time, anyway, for the medical question, it's online but through My Healthe Vet. The website. I need to login and it's secure messaging through the My Healthe Vet website.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:37.000

Tyler: Yeah. What do you like about secure messaging?

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:50.000

> P2: Well, it's like I said, you have proof that you contacted somebody there at the VA. You know your question should go in their mailbox kind of right away. It's better than mail, even phone, like, phone, you cannot reach them. And so overall it's not too bad.

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:06.000

Tyler: Yeah, it feels like you have more direct contact with the person compared to trying to call them over the phone.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.000

> P2: It's better than it used to be.

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:18.000

Tyler: Yeah. That's really helpful. Well, I've asked you a lot of questions. Do you have any questions for me at this point? No? Okay. I know at the beginning we talked a little bit about like this frustrating experience that you're kind of in the middle of with the GI Bill and your son.

Tyler: I don't have a lot of information, unfortunately from my role within the VA, that could help you, but I do know a little bit about sign in options. And it may be more complex than this but you mentioned it required your son to have a state ID. You can't use a passport. But it could be worth looking into ID.me, because you can use a passport to set up an ID.me account.

> P2: Yeah, I use that myself to get the military discount on commercial websites. When we went on the GI Bill application from the VA website, I don't remember seeing that option to sign.

> P2: First they say you have to be 18. You have to be 18 and you need to have a state ID. You only have a password. And the thing there, like I said, since he's about 18, I think it says you're a minor, get your friends to apply for you. Which I did. But then they got the all thing wrong. They approved it for me, not for my son.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:56.000

Tyler: Right. Okay. So it might be a little bit more complicated than I undersatnd it. But it could be worth looking if that helps at all. It sounds like you probably have the right, you probably have more information than I do on where the best place to go is. But thank you for sharing everything with me today. Especially any frustration that you've had.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.000

> P2: You're welcome.

Tyler: You notice things that I didn't notice and you notice things that other Veterans didn't notice. So I really appreciate it.

Tyler: Perigean, they're the folks who set up this research session and they're going to send you a note to say thank you and they're going to give you information to pass on to other Veterans who would like to maybe participate in sessions like this. But other than that, I think that's everything for me. Is there anything else you wanted to share?

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.000

> P2: No, that's it.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.000

Tyler: Okay, well thanks so much. It was lovely to meet you. Have a good rest of your day.

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:56.000

> P2: Okay. Bye.
