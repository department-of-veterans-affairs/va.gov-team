# P3 - January 24, 2024

## Transcript

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.450

Becky: So I've started the recording. And I'd like to confirm again, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

> P3: Yes.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:16.500

Becky: Alrighty, thank you.

Becky: Great. So we'll get started by learning more about your experience in general with VA and our online services. So first off, how long have you been a Veteran?

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.589

> P3: Oh, goodness was active, started active duty in 1983 and separated at 92.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:47.329

Becky: Amazing. And have you ever contacted VA online or over the phone? As you've interacted with VA?

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.090

> P3: Many times.

Becky: Interesting, was it online or over the phone?

> P3: Yes, many times.

Becky: Oh, both of them, both options?

> P3: Yeah.

> P3: I use the video chat with telehealth and the secure email secure messaging, I guess.

Becky: Gotcha. Oh, so you're saying you've also used video chat, too.

> P3: Yeah. Might have a lot of appointments that way. It's just works out easier for me.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.339

Becky: Got it What are some other times that you've contacted the VA outside of those appointments?

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:38.549

> P3: Well, again, you're mostly on the phone using the automated pharmacy system and speaking directly with the pharmacist or technician.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.07

Becky: Got it. So sounds like you have a lot of experience contacting VA.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.120

> P3: Yes.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:53.420

Becky: Great. So it was really helpful to just learn a little bit about your experience with VA.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.320

Becky: Next, I'm going to share some ideas through our prototype to get your feedback.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.030

Becky: So in the chat I'm going to send you a link to the prototype and make sure that's copied... and I mentioned earlier that a prototype is just like a test version of a website. So again, it's not gonna work perfectly. But that's way we can learn what we need to improve before we share it out with folks at large.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.819

Becky: Alright. So I'm going to send you this link right now in the Zoom chat.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.129

Becky: Let me know when you've opened it.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.650

> P3: Okay, it's open.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.709

Becky: all right. Now my next question is, have you ever shared your screen on Zoom before.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.280

> P3: I don't think we've ever had a reason to before.

002:49.520 --> 00:02:53.829

Becky: Would you need some help walking through how to share your screen right now?

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.170

> P3: Well, I don't see anything that says to share it. Is that on the main screen?

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.920

Becky: Yeah. So right at the bottom of your zoom screen. You should either see an icon that says, share screen, and it's green. Or it might also be hidden under more. Which is, should also be at the bottom of your screen next to the end button.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.080

> P3: Oh, there's the share screen. Okay?

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.490

Becky: And you should see some different options. They'll just want to share the window the prototype that I just sent you.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.170

> P3: Okay.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.630

> P3: I've selected that and share that work.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:58.710

Becky: Yes, amazing.

> P3: You 't teach an old dog new tricks.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:08.180

Becky: I always get nervous. Trying to walk someone through something when like I cannot see their screen. But I'm glad that worked out.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.090
> P3: I was a programmer for a while at state of [state]. So yeah, I understand talking people through things.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.100

Becky: For sure.

Becky: It's it's definitely a skill. So that's awesome. We can see your screen right now all right. And we're on the start page.

Becky: And we're not gonna click on anything just yet. But I'm gonna give you a moment to take a look at this page and as you're looking through it, can you tell me what jumps out to you? What you notice first.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.320

> P3: Well, the sign in basically. Because that's the main thing that we usually look to when we go to these sites.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.590

Becky: And what makes it jump out at you.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.280

> P3: It's helpful that it's contrasting colors. I usually do things on dark mode. So if this were available in dark mode, the green would not show up very well. It would need to have some kind of other contrast.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:20.439

Becky: Yeah, it's interesting to hear that from your different perspective and how you use dark mode.

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.909

> P3: Yeah, it's just easier on my eyes.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:29.160

> P3: I normally wear glasses, but I have things set up at the point and normal people use, you know, normal size screens for their computer. So I'm using an older 48 inch TV as my monitor.

> P3: I see I'm sitting about arms length away from it. So that gives me little better vision. Everything is little bit larger which helps on my eyes. And if I need to, I can zoom in on things or increase the zoom on it enough to make things larger and easier to read.

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:09.110

Becky: Yeah, that's really helpful to understand. And you know, as you can see on the page, there are lots of other things and understanding that you're on this larger screen, and that you need to zoom in. Is there anything else that stands out to you right now as you're scrolling through?

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:23.469

> P3: Not really. The the main thing that stands out is something that is not there, and I've complained about on several occasions is the fact that VA sites like this, where there's a sign in or create account. There is never anything that says, 'Remember this device.' There have been times where I've had to log in multiple times during the day and every time I got to wait on that doggone secure access code verification code, whatever you want to call it it to me that.

> P3: I mean, this is a desktop computer. I'm not taking it anywhere. I'm mobility challenged. I don't go many places for me. That kind of stuff, not being able to have it. Just click it to sign in. Remember this device. You've gone through all this before. It's been verified. Everything has been done codes have been sent back and forth, entered, whatever needs to happen. And like, I said, sometimes multiple times during the day, and yet I still have to do it.

> P3: I mean. there are so many other websites that once you verify it, you can remember it says, Remember the device, or remember me or do not challenge anymore that type of thing. And yet Va doesn't seem to want to follow that protocol.

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:08.680

Becky: Yeah, it's helpful to hear your experience just on other VA websites and compare it to what you're seeing right now. So that's really interesting to hear. Great. So for the rest of this conversation. I'm gonna give you scenario. So I'd like you to pretend that you need to ask via a question. And let's say the question is around you recently noticing some problems with your hearing. And so you want to ask via how you can get your hearing checked by an audio by an audiologist.

Becky: So without clicking anything just yet, can you tell me what you do first?

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:40.020

> P3: Well normally I'd have to sign in. But the first place, I'd look would probably be at the VA benefits and healthcare

Becky: Interesting. And why would you? Look at that part? I'm assuming you're talking about that VA benefits and healthcare menu at the top.

> P3: Yeah, at the top left. I already know what location I'm assigned to. So that's not an issue. I know a little bit enough about the VA. So not gonna worry about that. But since I'm looking for some type of service and care. I would look under health care. That would be my first choice. I would do that, and if I didn't see anything in the dropdown that might lead me to that, then I would just try and search.

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:33.290

Becky: Got it. So it sounds like you'd go topic first and then land on some sort of page like this.

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:37.039

> P3: Yeah, most of the times when I call to ask a question it's a while I'm on hold. I'm going through the website. And there have been a number of times where I found what I was looking for before someone on the other end picked up the phone.

00:09:51.180 --> 00:10:06.720

Becky: Got it. It sounds like you're trying to proactively do that research, while you wait to talk to someone, too.

> P3: There's been times where I saw, I have no idea what I'm looking for. But I'm on the website and while I'm there I kind of take a quick look at it and go. Oh crap! I have no idea. So did I make the phone call, because I know that's gonna take a few minutes. And if at all possible, I will not call on a Monday or Friday.

Becky: Got it. Yeah, it's interesting to hear your your approach here to the scenario.

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:35.190

> P3: Like I said, previous experience, I understand, probably a little bit better than some folks do. But that doesn't mean I'm gonna get anything done quicker than anybody else. I just know that at some point they're gonna say, well, you can look on the website. And it even says so in the messages while I'm waiting on the phone, you know. So it's like, Yeah, I'm already there. Get somebody. I want a person type of thing.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:58.100

Becky: Yeah, for sure. You're relying on that past experience. Yeah.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:02.550

> P3: Arguing with the robot is fun. Gets me through my day. But since I'm out of coffee and drinking my lemon water now.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:24.670

Becky: Yes, for sure. Alright! Let's let's do it through this prototype. We talked through your approach as to how you'd start approaching the scenario where again, you need to ask me how to get your hearing checked. So if you scroll down go ahead and click. Continue without signing in.

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.709

> P3: I don't see it. Continue. Oh, there it is!

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:52.860

Becky: Yes, it seems like that was difficult for you to find, so we'll we'll note that down.

> P3: I mean, they could be the same size, or even sign in or create account. Continue without signing in. Put them on the same line. That's where these old eyes are looking, anyway.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:58.620

Becky: definitely. alright. So I'll repeat the scenario. One more time. You're asking the how to get your hearing checked so can you show me what you do first on the page.

> P3: Category, here. Well health care.

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:36.370

Becky: Alright. So you just chose health care. And now you're on this page.

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:41.479

Becky: Now, can you show me what you do on on this one, and what you would select?

> P3: Right there at the top is audiology and hearing aid.

Becky: Oh, actually, are you speaking right now? Your audio might be a little muted. If you're covering your mic. Oh, yes, it's very hard to hear you right now.

> P3: phone access is on.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.340

Becky: Alright, I think you said, and relying on the live transcript, you said the access is on.

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:22.130

> P3: Yeah, everything should... I Haven't changed anything since we began talking.

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:29.760

Becky: Hmm have you maybe moved away from your screen at all, or maybe something got unplugged?

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:38.149

> P3: I brought my light back down. I noticed my camera's not on. So because I'm not doing video. So I don't need to have my face lit up.

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:45.180

Becky: Alright. Yeah, it's fine to not have your video on. It's a little interesting how your your sound is just very muted right now.

Becky: Yeah, I'm gonna maybe mute and then unmute you and see if that helps.

Becky: All right, you're still pretty faint. Alright. Let me just try turning up my volume and can you say something again.

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:22.550

> P3: Sure. Passed one, too.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:30.230

Becky: Okay, you're still pretty faint, but I can still hear you, so we can go ahead and still keep going. It's totally fine. We'll work with this technical challenge.

> P3: There are volume setting on my side. By turning the microphone up a little bit.

Becky: Yeah, I'm not sure if there's a volume setting on your side.

Becky: Still the same volume. But I think we're we're okay to keep going.

Becky: Alright. We're reviewing. Well, we're on the screen. I asked you what you do on this page, and can you walk me through your choice here?

> P3: Okay, well as just as I scroll down. It's asking, since I'm in the healthcare category, topic that best describes my question would be right at the top the Audiology and hearing aids. Since I'm looking at some hearing issues, audiology.

Becky: And how do you think this question is different from the last one you just answered.

> P3:  this one is helping drill down and be more specific, whereas the others was just general. Why are you here, type of thing.

Becky: Okay. Yeah, that that makes sense to me. It's a more specific topic, for lack of a better word, to healthcare.

> P3: That's... I treat these like a filter, I mean rather than being on the main page and trying to do a search for hearing test. It's like, well, I don't have... out of all the other choices, nothing was dealing with healthcare or making a medical appointment type of deal for testing. So drill down. And then, when you, as that continues, then all that other stuff is removed from the page, and we're left with these topics.

Becky: Yeah, sounds like that categorization is more helpful than trying to do it at the top from your perspective. How to drill down through a website using...

> P3: Yeah, I want a hearing test. So I'm gonna go look at X-rays. That's not gonna get me anywhere. So...

Becky: That make sense to me. Let's go ahead and click Continue over to the next page.

Becky: alright, and take a moment to to view this page. Can you show me what you do here.

> P3: Question about... Those 3 really don't fit what I would want. I'm not looking at VA benefits because I know I'm already eligible. I'm not looking for someone else's VA benefits, in my situation, I'm the only Veteran in the household. And it's a general question doesn't fit because I want audiology testing. So I have a specific question, not a general.

Becky: Yeah. So in this case, after going through all the options which one would you still choose in this scenario?

> P3: Under these 3 conditions or 3 variables, I would say it's a general question.

Becky: Alright, and just taking a pause here in the middle of the form, too. I do want to ask, how much longer do you think this form is right now?

> P3: Well, since we're on question 2 of 4 several pages already. Usually, whatever VA says, I multiply it by 3, and I'm in the ballpark. so I'm hoping maybe less than 12 pages to go.

Becky: Got it. So it sounds like just from your experience with VA, you're expecting this to last a bit longer.

00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:54.350

> P3: And to me. This type of thing up here 2 of 4. Your question. That's useless. Meaningless. A normal Veteran, if there is such a thing, would look and they would expect, okay, I've got 3 more questions. But they may or may not have realized that they've already clicked 3 or 4 times to get to this 2 of 4. Either the counting here is wrong. Someone's trying to use new math and it isn't working. Or it's irrelevant.

Becky: Yeah, it's really interesting that you've picked up on our progress bar at the top to think about your expectations for filling out the rest of the form.

> P3: It's like I said, this is something that I used to do. I was in charge of the [program] program for 5 years. And I'm the one that converted all the reporting over to electronic. And I could run you through an entire scenario. But we don't really have the time for that. If you want to finish on time. But suffice it to say that their headquarters person, one of the secretaries, would drive personal vehicle over to our location once a week on Fridays, pick up all the reports from that previous week, take them back to the headquarters. Break them all down, and then mail them out to the different offices.

Becky: Yeah, sounds like that past experience with – I think you said the [program] program – has helped you understand the progress bar a little bit more.

> P3: Home energy assistance program.

Becky: Got it.

> P3: Yeah, that would up being nice. I managed to get all the reports to the office servers and I tweaked the system, created new files and formats and all kinds of different things like I said I could. I could spend a weekend talking about it. But their administrator told me, she said she just guesstimating that I've saved them over a million dollars worth of effort. Because now everything else, the other gal is not having to drive over in her personal vehicle, which is not covered under work, related activities. If you were to have an accident. you know. God forbid she got hurt, maimed, or killed. Benefits could be denied to her family because she wasn't doing what was expected. She was doing something outside that scope.

Becky: Yeah, you know, as I've also worked in local government. And I totally relate to that, too.

Becky: And moving us along here. For the sake of this scenario, too. On asking VA how to get your hearing checked, we'll go ahead and choose my own benefits, which I know is not option you had originally thought to select. But we'll choose that option and then hit continue. Alright. Now, can you tell me what you do on this page and and walk me through what you're thinking, too?

> P3: Again. Focusing on the progress bar, we're still at 2 of 4. If I were to have other issues, I'd be getting upset with that, because I mean, we've gone from annoyance, to misleading to annoying. Now it's a trust issue.

> P3: But select the reason you're contacting. I have a question. I want to say something nice, make a suggestion, I want to say something else. I guess it would be I have a question cause I'm still trying to get the audiology and a hearing test, find out what needs to be done.

Becky: Right. So it sounds like you choose I have a question since you yeah, you need to get your hearing checked, and you need to find out what needs to be done.

Becky: Okay, let's go ahead and click Continue over to the next page and same thing. Take a second to look at this. And can you tell me what you do next on this page, or what you notice, too.

> P3: Again, the progress bar hasn't moved. Now I'm getting to the point where since it's finally asking my question, type in my question and then click continue. But I'm at the point where I'm becoming frustrated and not caring anymore.

Becky: Got it. Yeah, it's really helpful to hear how your emotions have changed over the course of this form so far, it's really helpful to understand that. And how you're looking at the progress far, too.

> P3: I've been diagnosed with anger management issues. Mine's a little on the mild to moderate side. Some folks that are coming in with more severe than that, or PTSD, they would have been done a long time ago and I won't use the language I would use, but it would be at the point where, screw this, I'm done. They're not gonna help me. VA sucks. And that would prevent someone from continuing to get the service that they desperately need. And that happens in a lot of situations. More often than not. It's the mental health aspect of it. Where they really need to be able to talk to someone, and they're unable to get there. Because by now, like I said, I'm just getting slightly frustrated, flustered. If someone who has a serious need, they would have been done already.

Becky: Hmm, yeah, it's really helpful to understand this other perspective, too. And really, how you know, design informs how you you react to a process...

Becky: So that's really helpful to understand. Thank you.

> P3: Just on a personal note. There were times when I needed to contact mental health services and the situation like this popped up. And I said screw it. I'm done, and I've already had... I finally had someone there that I trusted, felt good about talking to her. And I thought we were making progress and she left, for whatever reason, we were at the point where, well, when you have a need, call me. I had a direct line to her office. I call that number one time, and it had been probably about 6 to 9 months after our last appointment, so I was doing pretty good, but I had some questions. And that is when I found out oh, she just gone.

> P3: I go, okay, well, who am I transferred to? Well we don't have anyone yet. You need to call the main office and set up an appointment and see who's available.

Becky: Yeah, I can see how that can be. A very frustrating experience to, you know. Talk to someone, then have them not be there anymore. You know, understanding that, too. I'm really curious to hear your perspective on the rest of this form, too. So go ahead and click, continue, and we'll see what the rest of the form has.

Becky: Alright, taking a look at this question, why do you think VA is asking you for this information?

> P3: At this point, this late in the process, I have no idea.

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:45.770

Becky: No, that's good feedback to hear. Let's choose I'm the veteran and hit continue to move on to the next screen.

Becky: Alright. And same question here. Why do you think the is asking you this?

> P3: Again, no idea. I don't even see how it's relevant.

Becky: Got it. For the sake of the scenario. Let's go ahead and click no. And hit continue.

Becky: Alright, and then we land on this page. So go ahead and scroll through. Take a look at what's on this page and let me know, does anything stand out to you on this page?

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:22.440

> P3: Yeah. Once again, they're asking social security number and birthday. And for God's sake, get rid of the pronouns. Actually, yeah, that right there would turn me on just about everything. My pronouns wouldn't matter even if I felt it mattered. It's condescending. It's ridiculous. It's falling under the woke status that's become so much a part of the the community here. It's like it's shoved down our throat. And I'm personally tired of the 1% dictating to the 99%.

> P3: Like, I don't know you. You look like a guy I'm gonna call you 'he'. If you come back and say I'm a woman, you call me a 'she'. No, your voice is deeper than mine, and your Adam's apple is bigger than mine. I'm not playing that game. I don't care what your pronouns are. You're going to address me. You can say Mr. [Last name], or sir, or okay. or hey, you! I don't care. Expecting me to know what your pronouns are after ever having met you. We might as well arm wrestle.

Becky: Yeah, it's interesting to hear your reaction to the pronouns field, the social security and service number fields.

Becky: Thinking of all the fields on the page. Is there any information you wouldn't want to give to the VA. It sounds like maybe pronouns would be one form of information.

00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:15.839

> P3: Pronouns and gender identity. There are 2. Males and female. Man is not a gender. Woman is not a gender. It's just a classification. Male and female.

Becky: Got it. No, that's helpful to understand your reactions to seeing these 2 fields.

Becky: Alright moving us along this personal information page again, you can't fill anything here. So we'll just pretend, like you filled in the information. And you can go ahead and click, continue.

> P3: And one other thing on this, we already have to fill out a profile when we create an account. So my login is tied to that profile. So why are they asking for the profile information again seems kind of redundant.

Becky: Got it. So it seems like it sounds redundant to you to ask for all this personal information again. Yeah, that makes sense to me.

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:33.739

> P3: like, I say, it just adds an extra click to now, we're, you know 3 of 4, but we've already clicked 2 or 3 times.

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:42.929

Becky: Yeah, so you clued in on the the progress bar again.

00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:47.239

> P3: So far my math conversion was correct. Right from the beginning. The 12 pages.

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:56.249

Becky: Can you describe this page to me and what it's asking for?

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.410

> P3: Yeah, my help facility

Becky: Got it. And what would you do first to search for your health facility?

00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:09.500

> P3: I guess it depends on what it is there. Presuming, here am I... The thing that's confusing to this is okay. I already know what my healthcare facility is, so I don't need to search. Again, be tied in with the profile.

Becky: Got it so from your perspective, you already know what it is. So you're wondering why they're asking you to search for it, right?

> P3: I mean, I didn't create a new account. I'm not registering for the account. I'm already part of the system. So again, why are we doing stuff that's already there should be available, linked into my profile?

Becky: Yeah, that's helpful to understand.

> P3: Whereas from the previous pages, I could see using the social security number and the birth date in order to verify a profile. So I suppose on specific occasions, that information could be valid to request. But once you're tied to the... or once the profile is verified, all of this stuff has become redundant again. That's already part of the profile. That's that's what the profile is for. This is my name. This is my social security number. This is my birthday. This is my address. This was my rank. Here's my nickname, if you want to use it. This is where I'm being seen 100% of the time.

Becky: Yeah, sounds like your sentiment is, you know, I've already provided this why are you asking for this information again, does that sound right?

> P3: Yeah, you know. Why are you asking me stuff you already know about me? Because I provided it when I created this. So why do I have to reidentify myself in such a fashion? Every single time I log in and right back to the do not challenge this device. Remember me. You know, that kind of thing? That verification is done. I shouldn't have to do it anymore.

Becky: Yeah, so I wanna walk back to something you said earlier. So you already know your health facility. We're gonna pretend that your health facility starts with the word James. So you can click inside the box, and we'll pretend, like you actually typed in the word James.

Becky: And now your facility is James J. Peter. So how would you? What would you do next here?

> P3: Once I found my name that'd be the one I would click.

Becky: Right, and after selecting your health facility, what would you do here?

> P3: Here, that would be it. So I would just click, continue.

Becky: All right, let's go ahead and click continue then. After you've selected your health facility.

00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:26.630

> P3: What I find also annoying, after I've selected my facility, it still brings up the others that are not me.

Becky: So it sounds like you'd expect just to see the one you selected. That's interesting.

> P3: I can't go back I guess.

> P3: But I'm selecting from the search the VA health facility, search by name. Already put in my name. I found me. I selected me. And that gave me my facility. And then it says, Select VA health facility required. Well, I already did that. That's how we got here. So I got it because we did that, there was nothing else to do.

00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:25.880

Becky: right. I see how that could be a bit repetitive – is what you're saying there.

> P3: And this, my facility is not listed, that should be tied in up here. Or right below the box, because once I've gone in and started typing in search by name, if I'm not finding me thendI would do the search by location to say, Okay, this is where I'm at. What are my facilities here? And I'm assuming names would be associated with that, too. But still, if they don't see me. that's where I'd say my facility is not listed. Not after selecting who I am and where my facility is.

Becky: Got it. So it sounds like this flows a little out of order for you, and some things aren't where you would expect them to be right.

00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:22.349

> P3: It's – and we joke around about it a lot – but it's like, I say, we're moving at the speed of government. And unfortunately, we're on the Federal Government side. So we're moving at the speed they think we should want to do. Not what is actually logical or user-friendly.

Becky: Yeah, yeah, that's really helpful to understand.

00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:42.289

> P3: I've yeah, I've spoken with other Veterans, especially older than I am, who do a lot of traveling to the different facilities. So they're constantly filling in their travel reimbursement requests, and the folks at the windows are always saying, well, you can fill this out online. And I go, 'Do you know how long it takes to fill out that form online?' I've complained so many times about that website I've gone back to just I've got mine printed and scanned in. I check a few boxes sign and date, that type of thing that I printed saying, this is where I've been. This is where I'm going. Blah. Blah. Blah. It's a very simple form.

> P3: Why can't that form be online where folks could click, click, click, electronic signature. The dates are automatically filled in for you, or you can change them if you need to and submit it electronically to VA travel. Because that they used to have in the facilities. Those were fantastic. So by all means, let's get rid of them.

00:38:50.470 --> 00:39:02.010

Becky: Yeah, you know. Now, hearing that, I'm really curious to hear what you think of the rest of this form. So just moving us along, can you hit Continue? And then we'll see. We'll see what's up next.

Becky: Here's where we're asking for phone and email. And just for the sake of time, let's go ahead and click Continue. This is a bit more straightforward.

Becky: And then here, with your contact preference, could you go ahead, and I'm so sorry. That was right. Could you go ahead and select US mail as the way that you'd prefer to be contacted.

> P3: Okay.

Becky: Alright. And then in this scenario, what would you do? To answer this question here

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:42.229

> P3: Oh, Jeez. I, at this point, I would probably just close my browser. We're still on 3 of 4, this is like the fifth time we clicked.

> P3: Country where you receive receive mail. If we already provided name, address, social security number, birthday, a list of several screens ago. o again, this is redundant and useless and frustrating. Also information that is in my profile when I created it.

00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:38.990

Becky: Yeah, that that seems to be a common theme here. Could you go ahead and click the dropdown and select United States here?

> P3: Okay.

Becky: Alright. And then we'll go ahead and click continue.

> P3: Okay.

Becky: And then same thing for this mail address. We'll go ahead and click continue since we can't fill in anything right now.

Becky: And then on this screen for the sake of time, could you go ahead and click, continue here. This is where it verify your address.

Becky: All right, and then landing on this page. What's your first impression of this page? What do you think it's trying to show you?

> P3: They're giving me a chance to update something that didn't go right on the website. Or, because, again, just like I said, just about everything that we've gone through should have been tied to the profile. So I guess they're trying to suggest do I have anything in my profile that needs updating or changing. But they're still gonna ask for it. Regardless. So it's like, why do I even have a profile?

Becky: Got it. Yeah, this seems to be a commonº I'm seeing a common theme in your feedback here.

00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:05.230

> P3: Yeah, all of this has been redundant. It's already available at some point. Just the last few pages here, where it was asking for address and stuff like that again. That was provided several screens ago. And again. all that information is in the profile. When you create your account and register.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:34.819
Becky: Got it. So on on this page, what would you do here? Can you show me?

> P3: Why, I would need to?

Becky: Yeah. So I saw you expanded these so you could see all the information.

00:42:56.600 --> 00:43:00.830

> P3: That's what I would wind up doing is like, what am I reviewing? Go through all of that to say, well, I guess I need to see what's going on because....

Becky: Yeah, let let's say in this scenario to your reviewing everything. And you actually notice that you input your phone number incorrectly. Can you tell me where we you would go to correct your phone number?

> P3: Interesting. It's not in the personal information... There's the contact, this whole section, contact information. I would click edit at this point. The contact information section here and the mailing address section here. All of that really should fall under the personal information. My opinion.

00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:14.320

Becky: Let's go ahead and click the edit button and contact information.

Becky: Got it so why do you think it should fall under personal information? And what are you seeing here?

> P3: Well, identification. That's just, so, I guess that would be the first part. Again, even relationship information, it could be under the personal area

Becky: Got it.

00:44:56.570 --> 00:44:58.470

> P3: We've already put in our name, preferred names. So nicknames and all that social security number, date of birth. No reason not to have the address in there, since they're asking for that as personal information at the beginning. Same thing with the phone number and email. Mailing addresses down here, when that's all personal information. That's that's one block.

00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:39.920

Becky: Right. So you're seeing – it sounds like you're seeing this as separate sections that aren't under personal information.

Becky: Yeah, so go ahead and click cancel under next to update, and we'll go over to the next the next screen.

Becky: So go ahead and click submit question here.

Becky: Alright, and I'll give you a minute to read this, and then afterwards let me know when you're done, and then can you summarize the page back to me, and what it's saying to you.

00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:26.650

> P3: Okay, it's just basically a confirmation saying, Hey, we've got your question. Here's your reference number. If you need to contact us about your contact. You'll also receive an email confirmation that should reply within 7 business days through the US mail.

00:46:42.450 --> 00:46:46.739

Becky: What would you expect to happen next? After reading all this?

> P3: At some point someone may or may not do something within the time frame, they said.

Becky: Got it. And what makes you say may or may not do something within the timeframe?

> P3: Just based on personal experience. Previous attempts at communicating this way. Like, I said, we went through all of that other nonsense to get to the page that says, Okay, we got it. Here's your reference number. We'll be contacting you if we need more information

Becky: So it sounds like this was a a long form to you.

> P3: Yes. This was extremely long.

Becky: Alright. And and at this page, too, is there anything else you'd like to know, after submitting your question?

> P3: Well, they've given me a reference number but they don't say how to use it if I have another question or, if it's been 12 days and I've heard nothing. Who do I contact? How do I contact them? So I can give this number to them.

> P3: And other than going through the call center. That's the 1,607 1,000. Everybody knows that phone number, other than the people we want to talk to. That gets us to the people that will send the note to the people we want to talk to saying, Hey, this person wants to talk to you. Which may or may not have happened right away.

Becky: Got it that that makes sense to me.

> P3: They actually got the message that we wanted them to get when I contact that number. I have the person read back the the exact message I want to hear or that I want delayed. And sometimes I say, Well, I'm still writing it, like, well, then, why are you asking me if that's all.... So it's just one of those deals where it's like, this is nice information. But, okay, now what?

Becky: Yeah, that's that's really helpful. Just your last quote. There, this is nice information. But now what? So it seems like they're still they're still wondering what will happen, even though you get this information.

> P3: I mean, yes, if additional contact information is needed where I need to provide that reference number, hopefully, that's going to show up in the email confirmation. But sure be nice to say, you will receive an email confirmation with further instructions on how to contact someone related to this or reference number or something to that effect.

Becky: Got it so a little more detail would be helpful on that aspect.

> P3: Supposedly the electronic communications, they get the bare minimum of what's necessary or what they think is necessary. But they don't. They don't step into my shoes.

> P3: I mean, I'm at the point now, I need to try and find the letter of who I've been switched to within one month's timeframe. I was switched from one provider to another, and I think they're on different teams now. I've got medications that have expired, so I don't know who I need to call. Because I haven't seen the new one, and I only saw the previous primary care provider once.

> P3: So... I'm the one that falls through the cracks. I'm the one that gets misplaced, misdirected, not listened to. I mean, it's bad enough, just seeing a primary care provider. But when I go to the emergency room. When I'm having an allergic reaction to a new medication that's causing severe symptoms, and I get forgotten in the emergency room waiting room.

Becky: Yeah, no, that sounds like a very frustrating situation. I'm sorry you had to go through that.

> P3: No one eally thinks of me. Not just Veterans overall, but me, because I don't hear that happening to other folks. Have a long wait or something, because other people come in after them. I mean I showed up at the the emergency room, the ambulance brought in another fellow, an elderly Veteran with a cardiac condition. So yeah, by all means. I understand him going before me. But to be flat out told, oh, I'm, sorry we forgot you were here. I've been staring at you at the desk. You could see me eye to eye every time you looked up. I don't believe that you forgot I was here because you saw me here.

> P3: So, yeah, that's happened more than once. I mean the emergency room, after hours, pharmacy and all kinds of stuff where I'm needing medications and what not.

Becky: Right, yeah, that's why we're speaking with you today to understand your experiences. Not just, well, especially in interacting with some of these online experiences, too. So we can try to alleviate some of those frustrations. So you know, going back to something you've mentioned throughout this is that the information's in your profile already.

Becky: So you mentioned again, there's a lot of information that's in your profile. So what if you didn't sign in at the start of this form? What would you expect then, in this experience?

> P3: If I didn't sign in? Everything we went through was what I would expect, because, how are they gonna know who I am.

> P3: That's where all that other information should come from. Once my profile is set. I registered in the system. They verified my registration through whatever means they need to. I see no need for that additional stuff. Yeah. They'll want to know why I'm contacting and things like that. But you already know it's me there's a profile registered in the system. Why am I giving you all my profile information?

Becky: Got it. Yeah, thanks for helping us understand, like that, your expectations between signing in and having all your profile information versus not signing in and then having to provide all that information. That's helpful.

> P3: I'm glad I can help.

Becky: Yeah. So we are a minute from the end of the session and you know I so appreciate you sharing your time and this feedback and all of your experiences with me. It's been so helpful to learn, and just to walk through this prototype with you. I do wanna leave some time here at the end to ask if you have any questions for me or anything you wanted to leave for us?

> P3: No that's pretty much it. Like I said, the main thing is the redundancy of information requested for verification when it's already there. And not being able to 'do not challenge this device' remember me. Anything like that where I don't have to keep doing the challenge questions and get the verification code and then enter a Captcha information.

> P3: It's, this is me. We've done this already, I said. Well, like, I say, especially multiple times during the day. That bugs the heck out of me.

Becky: Got it. Yeah, I think that's what I'm taking out of this session, too, that you're an experience user, and you know, you've already provided this information. So that's where your perspective is coming from, too registered in the system that has a profile.

> P3: That information is available. I mean. Yeah, I could see, maybe, you know, sending a verification code to say, this is my profile, but that should be done once. And then profile verified. All this information is verified. This is me.  Quit asking me, you know, quit challenging me to be me, but I know it's me. And you know it's me. And I know you know, it's me.

Becky: Yeah, definitely, if frustrating to continue to be asked for for the same information over and over again. So I definitely hear that. And again. I just appreciate that we've gone through all this, and you've provided your feedback, whether that's negative or positive, it's all helpful for us to understand Veterans perspectives.

Becky: So Perigean, who helped schedule the session. They'll send you a thank you note, with some information you can pass along to other Veterans if they so like to participate in future sessions.

Becky: And with that I will end the session, and I hope you have a lovely rest of your day. Thank you again for sharing all of your experiences with us.

> P3: Thank you, Becky. Thanks everyone else.

Becky: Alright, thanks, [P3]. Bye-bye, bye.
