# P15 - January 29, 2024

## Transcript

Tyler: Alright. So are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio today?

> P15: Yes.

Tyler: Okay, awesome. So I know that was a lot of information. But we got through the details of the session. And now I'm going to let Holly and Shelby into the session. And we can just say hello. So we've got Holly and Shelby that are joining us.

Holly Hansen: Hello!

> P15:: Hello, Holly! I'm [P15].

Holly Hansen: [P15], so nice to meet you. Thank you for being here. Thank you for your service.

> P15: Thank you for having me here with you today.

Tyler: Thanks, Holly, and we've also got Shelby here, Shelby, if you want to say a quick hello.

Shelby Carl: Hey, [P15]! Nice to meet you.

> P15: Hi, Shelby. Nice to meet you, too. I'm [P15].

Tyler: Awesome. So thanks, [P15]. So for the rest of the session, Shelby and Holly are gonna have their cameras off and they're gonna be on mute, and they're just listening in. And I see we also have Maria here. So now everybody's here, so we'll let Maria in.

Tyler: All right. There we go. Hi, Maria. I think she's still getting click connected, so we'll let her get settled. But she's gonna also be here observing too.

Tyler: Okay. So do you have any questions for me at this point?

> P15: No, not too many questions yet.

Tyler: Okay, cool. Well, if you have any, you just let me know.

Tyler: I think we're ready to get started. But before we start looking at that prototype I mentioned, I just want to get to know you a little bit better in your experience with the VA. how long have you been a veteran?

> P15: Since 2016.

Tyler: And did you start interacting with the VA From 2016 or only in the last couple of years?

> P15: I would probably say, since 2016, I've started interacting.

Tyler: Do you ever contact the VA?

> P15: Yes, I do occasionally. Yeah.

Tyler: How do you usually contact the VA?

> P15: Usually, I just call on my cell phone or something or email, maybe.

Tyler: Do you prefer to to call over emailing? Or what's your preference? Usually?

> P15: Generally just call

Tyler: Cool okay. Well, I think we'll talk more about that today. The service that we're looking at is about contacting the VA, like I said, and so we're looking to get feedback on things that maybe are a little bit confusing, or things that you find particularly helpful. So if you think about past experiences, you've had as we go through this, you're welcome to share those with me as well.

Tyler: So let's go ahead and get you set up with this prototypes. I know you're on your phone sometimes. This is a little bit trickier. But I do appreciate you being on your phone because that helps us test how well this works. So I'm gonna send you a link to the prototype in the Zoom chat. It's gonna show up on your phone, probably right now.

[Setting up screen share]

Tyler: Alrighty. So I can see your screen. Now. It says, Ask Va. And let's go ahead and start looking at this this page, so you can feel free to to scroll around. We're not going to click on anything yet. But I'm curious what you're noticing first?

> P15: It looks pretty much like the standard VA website at first glance.

Tyler: Okay, so it looks familiar.

> P15: Yeah and it has like a bunch of options to log in and create an account.

Tyler: Yeah. and what's this page? What's this page specifically about?

> P15: To get more information for questions that you have regarding the VA and their services.

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:29.740

Tyler: Okay, cool. So this is a page for you to get answers to your questions. And it sounds like there's some information about signing in and setting up an account.

Tyler: Alright. So for the rest of our conversation today, I want you to pretend, like you need to ask the Va a question. So we're gonna say that you've been noticing some problems with your hearing. And you wanna ask the VA how to get your hearing checked? But you don't really know how how to do that.

Tyler: Okay, so without clicking anything yet can you tell me what you would do first?

> P15:  I would probably go to the search area like hearing or Audiology and see what popped up. And if that was too complicated or I wasn't figuring out the answer, I would probably just try to call the number where it says need help.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense. And with, when when you say you would use the search, can you show me where you're seeing the search.

> P15: I thought this was the search right here, but then I saw it said like reference number. So maybe it's a function rather than like a general search. But that was the first.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. So the first thing you do is try and have a search on VA.gov to get the answer to your question.

> P15: Yeah, that's what I would probably do.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:14.769

Tyler: Alright. Let's say that you needed to use this service. So you needed to contact the VA using Ask VA. So if we scroll up a little bit. Where would you click first to use this service. Ask VA.

> P15: The hyperlink that says, Ask VA, I click on that link up at the top. There.

Tyler: Okay. So let's say that you ended up on this page. You clicked on that hyperlink you ended up here. And what's next? Does it seem like you need to sign in.

> P15: Yep, I'm seeing like in bright green, it's pretty noticeable saying to sign in or create an account. Below that it's still asking to sign in or create an account. So I would assume that I'd probably need to figure out my password information or create one if I didn't already have one set up.

Tyler: Yeah, that that makes sense. I can see why it seems like that. What are the benefits of signing in?

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:30.549

> P15: I'm guessing, I would assume they would have most of your information. If you were already enrolled in the VA healthcare system. They might have some of your previous doctor visits or some health issues that you were experiencing. And if you're able, sign in or log in, you may have access to your records and medical records and stuff of that nature.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. So it sounds like you would probably the first thing you do here is probably sign in. Maybe after you searched on your own on VA.gov.

Tyler: For today, we're actually gonna imagine that you're gonna continue without signing in. So we're gonna see what that process is like for you. So if you wanted to use Ask VA and you didn't want to sign in, can you show me what you would do?

> P15: I go to continue without signing in hyperlink.

Tyer: Okay, why do you think that link is smaller or less obvious?

> P15: I think because the VA probably wants you to sign in. So they can pull up your medical information or personal information to better assist you or help them, help you.

00:10:54.730 --> 00:11:02.970

Tyler: okay, that makes sense so it's maybe a little bit less obvious because the VA is trying to get you to sign in. They're encouraging you to do that.

> P15: Yeah.

Tyler: Thanks. That's really helpful. So let's click on. Continue without signing in. Okay, so now we're on a new page. And remembering your questions about getting your hearing checked. So with that in mind, can you show me what you would do on this page?

> P15: The first thing I'm seeing is select a category. So I would click on that.

> P15: And then it's kind of like general categories. So since it's more of a health issue for audiology, I'd click on healthcare.

Tyler: Okay, cool. Let's stay here for a second. That was really helpful the way you described it to me out loud. So you you chose a category, said there, maybe more general categories, and you think that this would fit under healthcare.

Tyler: How important do you think it is to answer this question correctly?

> P15: I would say it's very important, because if you are looking for, if you picked another option it would probably take you more down the path of something totally irrelevant to what you're looking for answers for, or information for.

Tyler: Yeah that makes sense. So you're gonna go down a certain path, and you want to start down the right path. Okay, cool. And when we're just on this page. Now, how much longer do you think this is going to take for you to get to the end?

> P15: It says 1 of 4 steps. So I'm assuming it's probably gonna be pretty quick, because they seem like simple options or questions that they're asking. So maybe 30Â seconds to a minute to get through steps.

Tyler: Yeah, okay, cool. So you saw it, says 1 of 4. And that feels like it's gonna be 4 more steps. So far they've been really, they've been like a simple step. So it feels quick. Okay, cool. That's really helpful. Let's click on continue.

Tyler: Alright. Can you describe what you're seeing here?

> P15: Now, it kinda took you in the path of healthcare. It's kinda taking you into a sub category of the general category of healthcare. So it's showing different departments that you may be interested in getting help with. So I'm seeing audiology and hearing aids, in alphabetical order. So that's helpful. And if I was looking for something with my hearing that would probably be my next step would be to select that option.

Tyler: Yeah, okay, cool. So that was that was really clear to me, you're saying that this is basically getting more specific compared to the last page about healthcare. And you told me which one you would choose in this scenario, which would be the the first one audiology. Let's go ahead and click on that.

Tyler: And what if you couldn't find something that fit your needs, what would you do here?

> P15: I would probably go back to, kind of, back me out to see if I can select the right category or the one that better fits my needs.

Tyler: So you would probably assume that maybe you'd chosen the wrong category.

> P15: Yeah.

Tyler: Okay cool. Let's click. Continue. We'll go to this next screen. Can you describe this screen to me?

> P15: It's the second step of trying to figure out my question. It has 3 simple options about what my question is about. Is it about VA venefits, someone else's benefits or a general question. So if I was trying to figure out more information on my hearing issue, I would probably select my own VA benefits, because I know I'm enrolled in the VA healthcare system.

Tyler: Okay. So because you know, you're enrolled in healthcare, you would choose my own benefits.

Tyler: Let's take a step out of the scenario for a second. What if you weren't enrolled in healthcare? And you had a question. Maybe it was about enrollment or eligibility. Which option would you choose in that scenario?

> P15: I probably pick general question because I would be kinda concerned about clicking on my own VA Benefits, because I probably wouldn't be sure if I qualified for them or had them or was enrolled or not. So I probably just try to say it's a general question.

Tyler: Yeah, I think that's really clear. Okay, well, let's go ahead and choose my own Va benefits like you said. And then we'll click. Continue.

Tyler: Okay, so what are we seeing here?

> P15: It's still continuing down the pathway of healthcare and the Audiology question. So that now it's asking the reason why you're contacting the Va. And there's several options from like, I have a question. I wanna leave a compliment, suggestion or other.

Tyler: Okay. Why do you think the va is asking you this question?

> P15: To find out more information as to what exactly you are trying to contact the VA with and what your concern is primarily for inquiring with the VA. So that they try to better assist you.

Tyler: So it feels like answering this might help the VA know what you're gonna contact them about.

Tyler: Yeah, okay, what would you choose in this scenario.

> P15: I would say, I have a question.

Tyler: Okay, let's click. I have a question. Alright. We'll keep going. Yeah, awesome.

Tyler: Alright. Why don't you describe this page to me, what would you do on this page?

> P15: I would type out, since the only option is to type out like a text response, my concern about my hearing that I am experiencing. I try to be as detailed as possible, so that the VA could try to help me or point me in the right direction, so I can get the proper attention that I need through the VA. For my issue.

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:52.649

Tyler: Cool. So you would type in your question here, and being specific might "help you, help them" kind of like how you said earlier. And this felt pretty straightforward. You could tell right away that this is something you would type in.

Tyler: At this point in the form let's say that we typed in your question. We're not actually gonna type it in in this prototype. How much longer do you think that the form is going to be?

> P15: I would say, probably 2 to 5Â min. It seems like the questions are getting a little bit more detailed and specific and based on the 2 of 4 at the top. It seems like it's not progressing as quick as I thought. And within each category of 1 through 4, it's kinda keep continuing down a path of asking more questions and getting more details and information from you.

00:19:52.520 --> 00:20:04.379

Tyler: Right Okay, that's really interesting. So earlier, we thought it might be like 30Â seconds. But then, as you've went on, you've realized that the form is getting more specific than you might have thought, and inside of 2 of 4 there might be multiple things.

> P15: Yeah.

Tyler: Yeah, that that makes a lot of sense. I think that's really helpful.

Tyler: All right. Well, let's go ahead and we'll we'll pretend, like we typed in your question. We'll just click. Continue. Okay. So what are we noticing here?

> P15: Now, they're asking for personal information and step 3. They want to know exactly who they're talking to with, if the person inquiring is the Veteran or family member of the veteran.

Tyler: Okay, so in your case, what would you choose?

> P15: I choose I'm the veteran.

Tyler: Why do you think the VA. Wants to know this?

> P15:: So that they can tell exactly who they are talking to and who needs assistance?

Tyler: So this way, they know they're talking to the veteran about their benefits. Alright, is there anything else on this page that you noticed? You mentioned the the 3 of 4 personal information changed.

> P15: Yeah, now, we're on 3 or 4. It's starting off with kind of a simple basic question. So now I'm assuming, like, it'll continue down more questions about personal information in the coming questions.

Tyler: Yeah, what kinds of things could you imagine they're gonna ask you in their personal information?

> P15: Like your address so they can figure out where you live and what the closest hospital or care center is located to you, which could also help them figure out, your healthcare team and doctors appointment times and dates. They might also want to know, like, your recent medical history. Like, how you are generally feeling. If you've had any changes in your medical history over the last couple of years that would be important for them to know about to, so that they can better assist you.

Tyler: Okay, that's really helpful. So lots of different questions, especially about your medical history, your location. To get you to the right care center or place, and then also know kind of some of your medical history.

Tyler: So if we think back to the beginning, when we started, we chose not to sign in right. Do you think that has any impact on the questions they're gonna ask you?

> P15: I think it would probably have impacts, because if I didn't sign in, you're not gonna have all of your personal information kind of pre âÂ kinda like saved in your profile. So the VA is not gonna know exactly who you are, what who they're talking to, or what your medical history is. So they're gonna need to find that and kinda and kind of pry out of you in order to get the help that you need.

Tyler: Right. Okay. So if you signed in, then they might be able to get some of that information from your profile, but because you didn't sign in, they need to ask you for more things.

Tyler: Yeah, okay, cool. Thanks. That's really helpful. Let's let's click on. Continue, we'll we'll go to the next page now and then walk me through what we're seeing now.

> P15: It's asking if you are currently a VA employee. Simple question.

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:28.840

Tyler: Yeah. So it's a simple question, why do you think the VA wants to know whether you're an employee?

> P15: I really don't know about that one. MMaybe they can find you in the system better, if they know you're an employee. But I'm not real sure why they would need to know that.

Tyler: Yeah. So even though it's a simple question for you to answer, it's not totally clear why you would need to answer this.

> P15: Yeah.

Tyler: Yeah, okay. We'll go ahead and answer this question, and then we'll we'll click. Continue. So we're not actually gonna type anything in on this page. But let's look through these questions together, and I'd like to know if things start standing out to you. So as you scroll, you can kind of just tell me what you're looking at and what you're thinking.

> P15: It's asking pretty basic personal information questions like your name, your social, your date of birth. How you prefer to call yourself. Your gender. And that's all i'm seeing so far.

Tyler: So you said, it starts pretty basic information, we've got first and last name. Here, let's look at social security number a little bit. So why is the VA asking for your social security number?

> P15: I'm assuming so that they can find out your identity. And to see if you're enrolled in VA healthcare and to verify your service and benefits.

Tyler: Okay so they need a way to verify you are who you say you are? Okay. And then what about service number? Do you know what the service number might be?

> P15: I'm assuming it's like your military service number that you were probably assigned when you enlisted. But I can say I don't really recall that when I enlisted, or when I was serving from 2012 to 2016. And I definitely don't know that number or, remember it if was given to me.

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:03.270

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. So social security numbers may be an easier one to have as a reference, service number not sure that we remember it and not even really sure if you had been given a service number. So in this case, do you need to have both your social security and your service number?

> P15: It just says, provide one of the following. So provide my social security. I know that.

Tyler: Yeah, okay. is there any other identity number from your experience, having been in the military now, being a veteran that you would prefer to give instead of your social security number?

> P15: No, I can't really think of like any number, any numbers I may. I probably did have some kind of service number, but it definitely wasn't really in use when I was serving, and I never needed it. I know my social. And I'm comfortable with that for these purposes. So I'm more than comfortable just using my social.

Tyler: Okay great. Have you heard of a DoD or EDIPI number.

> P15: Yes, okay.

Tyler: Is that something that you would have like as a reference or social security number is still a more obvious one for you.

> P15: Yeah. Now that you mentioned that one, I do kind of remember having that. But I definitely didn't have it memorized is probably just on like my ID or something, and I never really used it or never really needed it. So I would still primarily prefer just use my social because I know that and use it more in my daily life.

Tyler: Yeah, okay, that's really helpful. So your DoD EDIPI number, you would have to go find it. It would be a lot more difficult than asking for your social security number.

> P15: Yes, exactly.

Tyler: Okay, cool and then we can keep scrolling down. So we've got date of birth here. Then we've got our pronouns. Would you choose to answer the pronouns?

> P15: I would probably, I guess, since it says required, I just say use my preferred name.

Tyler: And then we've got gender. Same question here. Would you choose to answer your gender?

> P15: Yeah, I would just say, man, how I prefer to be identified or whatever.

Tyler: Alright. Well, this felt pretty straightforward. We're gonna pretend like you filled all these these fields in and we're gonna click, continue.

> P15: Okay.

Tyler: Alright. So now, what is the VA asking for?

> P15: It's trying to help you figure out your. I guess, nearest VA health facility, or most convenient facility. So it has a couple of options where you can search by the name or by location.

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:37.969

Tyler: So this is trying to help you find your facility. I think you're enrolled in healthcare right with the VA?

> P15: Yeah.

Tyler: You are, okay. So as somebody who's enrolled in VA healthcare âÂ you don't have to tell me the name of the facility. But do you know the name of your facility? Okay, so would you need to use this search?

> P15: I don't think, I guess, I probably would just start typing in like I'm from [City], and I use the VA [City] Medical Center start typing that in to see if it auto populated. Because I'm not totally sure what the official name is. I'd probably just put like my zip code in, and I'd be able to locate it pretty easily, I think.

Tyler:Yeah, that that's really helpful. So you know, when you started, and you said I would probably start by looking for like [City], VA. Would you type that into the name search by name?

> P15: Yeah.

Tyler: Yes, cool. Okay, cool that's really helpful. So here you would type in like [City], and hope that it shows up. If it doesn't, you would type in your postal code in the search by location.

> P15: Yeah.

Tyler: Got it, thanks. That details really helpful for me.

Tyler: Okay. So for today, we're gonna pretend like you're you're searching by name. So go ahead and and go back to search by name. And we can't type in the prototype today. But what we're gonna do is we're gonna pretend like, I know, this isn't necessarily case. We're gonna pretend like your facility. It starts with the word James. So if you click where you would type, you can just tap that once it'll so pretend like we've typed in James. So what are we seeing now?

> P15: It looks like it kind of populated a several different healthcare centers throughout the country that had the name James in.

Tyler: Do these names, like the the list we're seeing here, does does that look a little bit like the format of your VA facility's name.

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:53.049

> P15: I would say so. Yes.

Tyler: Does it have like a longer name? Maybe it's the name of a person.

> P15: I would say... Yes, I'm not... I don't think the [City] one has a person's name in it. But  I definitely kind of associate the Veterans Affairs Medical Center and the location like [State].

Tyler: Right. That makes sense. So even if yours has a name like that's not really what's top of mind. It's [City] VA.

> P15: Yeah, for me.

Tyler: Yeah. Alright. Well, let's pretend like your facility is called James J. Peters. Can you show me what you would do here?

> P15: I would click on James J. Peters and see what happened.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So what are we seeing now that you clicked on that?

> P15: It had like a circle with the selection I picked highlighted. So it kind of can makes me confirm to me that that is the right location that I wanted, and I can proceed from there.

Tyler: Okay, cool. Well, let's let's click continue. We'll pretend like that's the right one that you that you wanted to choose. And at this point in the form. can you tell me how well, how much longer. You feel like this is gonna be?

> P15: I would say not too much longer. But it does seem kind of like the information is kind of dragging out more than I was expecting to have to enter in everything. So probably I guess another 5Â min.

Tyler: Yeah. Okay. So again, your expectations have shifted because you're realizing this is longer than you would have guessed.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. And here it's asking for your phone number. And your email address. Is there anything else you think the Va needs to ask you about before you can be done?

> P15: They already have my name, social, address, phone number, email. I can't think of anything else.

Tyler: Okay, cool. And looking at this screen here, does this look pretty straightforward? What it's asking for?

> P15: Yes, very straightforward.

Tyler: Okay, let's go ahead and click, continue. Then we'll pretend, like we put in your phone number and email. So without clicking anything yet, can you tell me which option you would choose? Here?

> P15: I'd probably say phone.

00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:31.229

Tyler: Yeah, that's usually your preference. We talked about that a little bit at the beginning. And would you want to to choose more than one option, or just one?

> P15: If I could choose more than one, I'd probably choose email as well, just to kind of have like a safety net. So make sure I would be contacted or receive the information one way or the other.

Tyler: Okay, so if you chose phone and email, then maybe you're thinking, like, okay, if I missed their phone call, then hopefully, they would just email me. 

> P15:: Yeah, that's exactly how I'm thinking about it.

Tyler: Okay cool. Well, it looks like we can only choose one option here, and I know that that would probably be phone for you. But we're actually gonna do something different today. We're gonna pretend like you would prefer us mail. I know that's not your preference. But this is mostly so we can test the website. So we'll click on us mail and then we'll click, continue. Now, what are we seeing next?

> P15: It's saying country where you received mail. So I guess if you are currently serving in the military and maybe stationed or deployed outside of the United States, you might have a different address situation that the VA needs to be aware of. Or if you are a Veteran and you live outside of the United States, you'll have a different address situation, that may be more complicated to get you your mail.

Tyler: Okay, so do you feel like the focus of this page is on Veterans who might not might have this more complicated address situation?

> P15: Yes.

00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:28.440

Tyler: and on this page, what would you do?

> P15: I click on the country and I click on United States. Since I live in the United States currently.

Tyler: Do you feel like There's anything about this page that you would change?

> P15: It kind of âÂ the way it kind of like seems different that they're â instead of simply asking like, where do you live, or what country do you live in? I'd probably start with that first, because it's a pretty standard question, and, maybe I'm assuming that the majority of people are gonna be living in the United States. So it'll be a simple, clear type answer. But for the small percentage who may live abroad. Then it can kinda ask the more detailed question, like, what country do you live in? I live outside the United States. What country do you live in and go from there...

Tyler: Yeah, okay, that's really helpful. So it feels like it's maybe it's not made for the majority right now, which are probably the majority of Veterans, live in the Us. And it feels like you could first just check if you live in the us. And then if you don't live in the Us, you could ask more details.

> P15: Yeah, it seems like it's a little bit maybe too complicated. When it could be very simple.

Tyler: I can totally see that. That's really helpful. Okay, well, we chose United States. So we're ready to click, continue and then is there anything that stands out to you on this page, or does this look how it normally looks when someone asks for your address?

> P15: It looks how it normally looks. When I'm asked for my address I'd say.

Tyler: Okay let's pretend like we put your address in here, and then we'll click continue.

Tyler: And now, what's this page asking for?

> P15: I guess, based on your address, I guess the way the postal system works sometimes they need, they'll have a suggested address that you should use to help get your mail delivered.  As opposed to what the other address was to ensure that you get your mail. So it's asking you to kinda confirm your address and select the better option to ensure you get the mail.

Tyler: Okay. So they wanna make sure that you're you're receiving the mail, and they wanna give you the best possible chance at that. Have you seen something like this before?

> P15: Yes. I'd say just the suggested. To make sure I get the mail or whatever I'm ordering.

Tyler: Okay, So it looks like suggested is already clicked. So we can just go ahead and click. Continue here.

00:40:48.690 --> 00:40:51.239

Tyler: Alright. Can you describe this page to me?

> P15: It's the 4 of 4, it's asking to kind of review all your personal information that you entered. It looks like if you click on the pluses, it'll expand your previous categories and questions that you answered to kind of review them, to make sure that they are the proper answers. And then there's some edit buttons. If you feel like you need to edit your information before you submit it.

Tyler: Awesome. That was a really helpful description. So we're seeing that this is like a place for you to check your answers. You showed me how to to open and close these so that felt pretty straightforward. And then you also notice that there's an edit button, so you can sometimes edit something. So what if âÂ let's just, you know, think of an example. What if you wanted to edit your phone number? Let's say that you realize you put it in incorrectly.

00:41:50.570 --> 00:42:02.07

Tyler: Can you show me how that would, how you would do that?

> P15: I'd look for my phone number, probably like in the personal information section. So I'm seeing like my contact information down there, and it looks like press edit. And then I could go ahead and change my number if I entered it wrong, and then just press here.

Tyler: Yeah, that was helpful to watch you do that. So it felt pretty quick. You you assumed it would be in personal information. Then you found contact information. You clicked edit. Now, we can't actually type in this today. But we'll pretend like you typed a different phone number, maybe and it also looks like you can edit your email. Can you edit how how you're contacted? So we chose us mail. Can you change that?

> P15: And let me see here, the mailing address, I'm not. I'm not being able to open edit there. So I'm not sure if that's...

Tyler: Yeah, sorry, that's just the prototype. So since I can't see your mouse, it's since it's your finger. So you're trying to click on edit next mailing address?

> P15: Yes.

Tyler: Okay, Gotcha. So that might be where you would think to change your contact preference.

> P15: Well, let me think. Contact preference. Yeah. Oh, I guess I would be back in contact information, because I see it says, how shall we contact you. And okay. And then I can update from there if I want US mail. I'm assuming you could probably change it to email or phone.

Tyler: Awesome thanks for thanks for describing that to me, and sorry. I know that the prototype doesn't let you click on everything. So thanks for bearing with me. Alright. Well, let's let's pretend like we reviewed everything. We are ready to submit our question, and you can go ahead and continue.

> P15: Would that be...

Tyler: Alright. So I saw we had a little look around for the button, and then we we clicked on. Submit question.

Tyler: Now, we're on this page. I'm gonna give you a couple of minutes to just read this page, and then I'd love for you to summarize to me what you're learning here.

> P15: Okay. It looks like after you submit your question, the VA just kind of confirms with you that your question was submitted successfully. So they have that in green which is reassuring to me, that I know my question successfully went through. And then they do a good job giving you like a reference number. So that looks official to me that my question is submitted, and I have a number that I can reference in case I need to go back and communicate with the VA.

> P15: As to the progress of my question. I have a number I can easily pull up. It's reassuring to me that they sent a confirmation email as well. So I can have that my records in my inbox.  They're saying that someone should they'll mail out a response to my question within 7 business days. And they're reassuring me like, if they need any more information that will go ahead and contact me and at the bottom, there's the the need help again. That's been pretty throughout the whole process, with the number and the hours, and what not to call if you're having issues.

Tyler: Awesome. That was a really helpful summary. So it sounds like there's a lot of information in there. Is there anything that you would like to know after you submit your question that you haven't learned from this page. Is there anything missing?

> P15: No, I'm kind of assuming, you know, it's gonna take some time with the VA, for them to go through my request and question. And I'm just happy to know that it was submitted. I have a reference number, and that I'll get some kind of reply within 7 business days. Other than that, I can't really think of what else I could ask for.

Tyler: Yeah, cool. Well it sounds like you got a lot of the things that you'd need from this.

Tyler: This has been super helpful to look through the prototype. You've actually reached the end of the prototype. So you're welcome to stop sharing your screen if you like, and we can just chat for the last couple of minutes.

[Help stop sharing screen]

00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:54.009

Tyler: Alrighty So we just finished with the prototype. We went through a lot of different screens, and that was super helpful for me to see how you clicked through them and what you were thinking about. What do you think of that process overall?

> P15:: I thought it was a pretty smooth process. I've dealt a little bit with, like the VA online and the screens all kind of looked familiar and the questions were pretty simple to answer, so I appreciated that. And it seems pretty straightforward process.

Tyler: Yeah, that's helpful. What do you think that you would want to change? Is there anything that could be easier?

> P15: I guess just maybe be a little bit more straightforward as to far as the length, like, the time cause I was seeing like what steps 1 through 4. And at first they were starting out pretty basic questions. And then it just kinda kept going and going. And maybe that that might be off putting to some people, and they might just say, I give up, or I don't know this information. But other than that can't really think of anything.

Tyler: Yeah, well, that's a really helpful one to note. So the throughout. When I asked you, how much longer do you think this is gonna be your expectation shifted? As you use the form. And so I think we could see that that progress bar that was trying to give you an idea of where you were wasn't really giving you enough of an idea of where you were. So there's a little bit of guessing involved in in terms of how long it would take.

Tyler: And I think, compared to the first time you said it was maybe gonna take about 30Â seconds. And I know we're in a research environment. So we're talking a lot, too. But I think that probably was a little longer than you thought it was gonna be even so.

> P15: Very much.

Tyler: Yeah, awesome. Is there anything else you want to share about what we looked at today?

> P15: I can't really think of anything else I could say about it.

Tyler: Yeah, that's okay. I know it's like a long time to to talk about one website. Do you have any other questions for me? It could be about this research that we're doing, or anything?

> P15: No, no real questions for me.

Tyler: Cool. Well, thanks so much, [P15]. We've reached the end of our our session and our time.

Tyler: Perigean, they're the folks who set up this research session. They're gonna send you a thank you note. It should be familiar since you've taken part in research before and if you have any questions you can follow up with them.

Tyler: But I think that's it, I really appreciate your time. It was so helpful to get your feedback.

> P15: Okay, well, thank you very much for having me, Tyler, and I look forward to working with you again down the road.

Tyler: Yeah, I hope to see you again in research!

Tyler: Alright. Well, thanks, [P15], have a good day.

> P15: You too. Bye.
