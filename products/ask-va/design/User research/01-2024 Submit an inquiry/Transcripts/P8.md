## Transcript

Tyler: Okay to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio today?

> P8: I am.

Tyler: Perfect. Thank you, [P8]. So we've got through the beginning of the session. I know we lost a little bit of time just trying to get ourselves set up, which is totally understandable.

Tyler: Before we get started, I'd like to learn more about your experience with the VA. How long have you been a Veteran?

> P8: I joined the Navy in 1985. And I, processed out of Active duty in 1987 and then I went reserves until nineteen – Since 1989 I guess.

Tyler: Yeah. Did you start interacting with the VA right away or only a last couple of years?

> P8: No, I didn't get started with the VA until, 2010, 2011 somewhere in there. When I lost my medical insurance.

Tyler: Okay, yeah, that makes sense. And we talked for a second about wanting to get in touch with your caregiver. I'm wondering, when you contact the VA, do you usually contact the VA over the phone online or another way?

> P8: Messaging, cause it's easier than calling them and waiting forever for this and that. I'll send a message, but it usually goes into a general mailbox. Sometimes the caregiver that I have doesn't get the message.

Tyler: Right, okay, so are you using my healthyevet when you're sending messages?

> P8: Yeah

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. So that's gonna be a really useful comparison for me today. So the secure messaging on my healthy vet is pretty similar to what I'm working on today.

> P8: Everybody can see your message to your caregiver. It's not private anymore, right?

Tyler: Yeah, okay. So I'll ask you some more questions about that as we continue because that'll be really helpful for me to learn more about how you use secure messaging. What we're gonna do now is we're gonna share a prototype. So this is gonna take a little bit of time to set up.

Tyler: I'm gonna send you a link and you're gonna see it pop up on your phone. And when you see the link on your phone, I just like you to click on it. And this is just a prototype. Like I said, this is a way for us to test, something that we're working on.

Tyler: So I'm sending you the link on zoom and you're gonna see it pop up on your phone. And once you've got this open on your phone, let me know and I'll tell you what we're going to do next.

> P8: Okay, I clicked on it.

Tyler: Perfect. So it should be opening on your phone. Are you seeing a website open?

> P8: Just a minute. Nope. Do it again.

Tyler: Okay, I'll send it again.

> P8: I know I touched it.

Tyler: No worries.

> P8: I touched it. Okay, here we go.

Tyler: Alright, so now it's opening up on your phone. Okay, perfect. So now that the website is open on your phone, what I need you to do is to share your screen with me. Is that something you've done before?

> P8: This phone doesn't do that.

Tyler: It doesn't do that.

> P8: No, that's why I was looking forward to the computer. So I'm in the app that you want me to look at. You want me to sign in?

Tyler: No, not yet. So I'm gonna need to be able to see the same thing that you're seeing throughout our call. So if you don't think that we'll be able to share on your phone, that I'm going to need to share on my computer and you're gonna have to look at what I'm looking at.

> P8: Okay. Alright.

Tyler: So we're back. Yeah, so we have 2 options. I can share on my computer or we can switch to your computer.

> P8: Share on yours, that's fine.

Tyler: Okay, I'll share on my computer for today. So. Let me just set that up. That way you see me too.

> P8: Yes. That sounds good. And I'll work on getting a wireless camera.

Tyler: Sounds good. Alright, just give me one moment to set this up on my computer.

> P8: I had to get a wireless keyboard and a wireless mouse cause he chewed those cords up too.

Tyler: Oh gosh. Yeah, maybe. Maybe the cat needs a different space. Away from the computer.

Tyler: Alright, can you see what I'm sharing now? Okay, so what is it? Can you describe it to me?

> P8: I can.

Tyler: What does it look like?

> P8: It says ask VA and then it says signing in is required and then it's a sign in or create an account.

Tyler: Perfect. Okay. So what are you noticing first on this page?

> P8: Of the VA.

Tyler: Okay, so you notice you're on a VA.gov site. And what is this page let you do?

> P8: Let me sign in.

Tyler: Okay, it's a sign in page and if you sign in, what would happen next? What would happen after you sign in?

> P8: Me to go through the things where I have to do a double sign in because I do the double step thing. And then I get in there, it'll go to the VA.gov site, you know, they give me a dashboard to tell me where I can go. Like I can check. My medications, my appointments. My claims. And I forgot what the other one was.

Tyler: That's okay. So it sounds like this page it feels like it's for signing in. And once we sign in, we're going to go to the homepage.

Tyler: I'm gonna give you a second to just read it a little bit more closely, so I'll stop right here.

Tyler: Is there anything new that you're noticing?

> P8: Other than the signing in is required and it sign in or create an account? No.

Tyler: Okay, that sounds good. So. This is a way for you to ask the VA a question.

> P8: That was on this site yesterday.

Tyler: Okay, so that was on the site yesterday. Okay, what do you mean by that?

> P8: I was on the site yesterday.

Tyler: You were on this site yesterday? Okay. Got it.

Tyler: So for the rest of our conversation, we're gonna pretend like you need to ask the VA a question. So I'm gonna give you a scenario. We're gonna say that you've recently noticed you have some problems with your hearing and you want to ask the VA how to get your hearing checked.

Tyler: So you don't know how to get your hearing checked. All you know is you need to probably go see an audiologist.

> P8: I have to contact my caregiver.

Tyler: Okay, so you would contact your caregiver first. Yeah, that makes sense. So if we were on this page, it sounds like we need to sign in, right?

Tyler: I'm going to scroll down a little bit further. I'm gonna give you a moment to read this.

> P8: Okay, this is familiar.

Tyler: Yeah, why is this familiar? You remember seeing this on?

> P8: Yeah.

Tyler: Okay, can you tell me why signing in is helpful?

> P8: Because it automatically goes to my information and I don't have to input it.

Tyler: Got it. Okay. Yeah. And what if we were not gonna sign in today? What if we didn't want to sign in? Is that an option?

> P8: Yeah, so continue without signing in.

Tyler: Okay, got it. So we kind of know the benefit of signing in is that they're gonna have your information. But there's also an option to not sign in. Okay. Alright, so let's click on continue without signing in.

> P8: Right.

Tyler: We're gonna imagine you don't want to sign in and you're asking the VA a question about getting your hearing checked. So can you describe this page to me?

> P8: It says, okay. I can upload any documents I need to upload for any benefits that I'm looking into and it says select the category that best describes your question. So it gives me, an area where I can look for key information. To ask a question in a certain area so I don't have to go and blindly.

Tyler: Got it. Okay. So I'm gonna open this so that you can have a look, okay?

Tyler: So I'll scroll down. Tell me what you're seeing here.

> P8: It gives me a list like education benefits, disability compensation, debt for overpayment or this decision, and just basic information.

Tyler: Basic information. Okay. And so if you came here because you had a question about how to get your hearing checked, what would you do here?

> P8: I'd go to healthcare.

Tyler: You go to healthcare. Does that feel like an easy choice? How do you know that it's healthcare?

> P8: Because that's the only way to get to my care team.

Tyler: Okay. So we'll click on healthcare. And how important do you think it is to answer this question correctly?

> P8: Which one's that?

Tyler: This question here, healthcare, how important is it to choose the right option?

> P8: Oh, it takes you totally in different areas. So if you don't answer that question correctly, then you're not going to get the answer you need and they're going to give you the runaround.

Tyler: Hmm, okay. What's the run around? Can you describe that to me?

> P8: They'll send you to different areas until you get to the right area and sometimes it's a hundred areas.

Tyler: Okay, so we know that we're gonna get sent somewhere depending on what we choose. So it's important we choose the right one.

> P8: Yes.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. Alright, we're gonna click continue.

Tyler: Can you just describe this page to me?

> P8: It gives me a list of what I wanna ask questions about. And like you said, audiology is the first one. So that's the hearing. When I was like that. Yep.

Tyler: Okay, so we choose audiology. Yeah. What's the difference between this page and the last page?

> P8: This one is more precise to what I'm looking for like, health care information. But there's stuff missing.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. There's stuff missing. Tell me about that.

> P8: I deal with a lot of stuff out of town, so. I don't go to my local VA, they send me to Ann Arbor. And there's no way on here to show Ann Arbor or Detroit.

Tyler: Right, okay, so you're already trying to figure out which medical center you're dealing with because you want to go to the right one. Yeah, that's really helpful.

> P8: Because they're the same system.

Tyler: Okay. What's this gray box?

> P8: Your category topic category healthcare. That's telling me that I'm in the right area.

Tyler: Okay. And how much longer do you think this form is going to be?

> P8: I hope not very much longer. Cause there's a lot on here. But it's a little, I mean. I get audiology is at the top and they're trying to do alphabetical order but they should go and order like You're going to the VA for medical reasons. So your care team should be at the top.

Tyler: Okay, so you wish that this was an order of like the most common use. Right, that makes sense.

> P8: Right.

Tyler: And you notice that it's alphabetical instead. Okay.

> P8: Right. I get the alphabetical, I understand that. But this is supposed to be my information is already in the system and I know this is the general one. Most people that look on here, even though they didn't sign in, would want to go to their medical team. And I don't see a pharmacy on here.

Tyler: Okay, so we're looking for things automatically that you're used to seeing maybe in my healthy vet or or other health care tasks you do on VA. Like pharmacy.

> P8: Yeah.

Tyler: That makes sense.

> P8: So medicine should be on here and then oh and Community care.

Tyler: Okay, so we're missing a couple of key tasks that you do related to your health care. And that's a little confusing.

> P8: Yeah. The only time I go to the local VA is for yearly exams or if I need something like I got an appointment coming up for a wheelchair. I had to go to the VA to do that. But other than that, I spend 90% of my time in Ann Arbor.

Tyler: Gotcha. Alright. Let's continue. Let's keep.

> P8: Cause I have a heart condition so anything I do, they wanna have down with the cardiologist. Cause he comes out of the U of M. So they send me down to Ann Arbor VA to deal with all that so that the cardiologist can get on board with everything going on.

Tyler: Right, okay. So it's really important to you at this point that you're getting sent to the right place and that's not obvious right now.

Tyler: Yeah, that's helpful. So we're gonna click continue. And now we're on a new page.

Tyler: Can you tell me what you would do on this page?

> P8: I would go to it's a general question. Because, I want to ask about audiology and getting tested for hearing. And if I go to my own VA benefits, that'll take me into a totally different screen. Off of medical information.

Tyler: Right. What are you imagining will happen if you choose my own benefits?

> P8: So send me to like a financial page to tell me what all my benefits are.

Tyler: Okay, got it. So this is a general question.

> P8: And I have any other than medical.

Tyler: Okay, gotcha. So you know that you need to ask a question. So you're gonna choose it's a general question.

> P8: Right.

Tyler: Okay, so this is gonna throw you off a little bit, but we're actually gonna choose my own benefits, which I know doesn't match your expectation, but that's really useful feedback.

Tyler: So we're gonna click my own benefits. And now just for a moment, let's pause. How much longer do you think this form is?

> P8: I hope not very much longer.

Tyler: Yeah, how would you figure out how much longer it is? Is there any way to figure that out?

> P8: Well continue and see what's on the next page. And it's at the top, 2 of 4 questions.

Tyler: Okay, it says 2 or 4 questions. So. How many more questions do you think there are?

> P8: Well, other than the 2 that they give you. I'd say a little bit more because you want to get into a more, wanna get down to where you can get your question answered.

Tyler: Right, okay. When we're imagining using this website, do you think that you're going to get your question answered on the spot?

> P8: It'll get to general, it'll get to a general answer and it'll tell me where to go to get the more precise answer.

Tyler: Gotcha, okay. Is it gonna give you like a link to a website to read or how?

> P8: Generally, usually it gives me a place the call within the VA to get what I need.

Tyler: Okay, okay, so we're figuring out where to go. And the VA system through answering these questions.

> P8: Yes, cause if the VA to get these questions answered, you'd go to 20 different people before they sent you to the right department.

Tyler: Right. Yeah, that makes sense. So this is you're seeing this as a way to make sure you can call the right person more directly. Perfect. Okay.

> P8: Right. Before I get to the calling part because I know how that works.

Tyler: Yeah. Alright, we're gonna continue. We're gonna click continue. And now we're looking at this new page. Can you describe this to me?

> P8: Oh, it has a list of things that you could contact them about like, questions or say something else or complaint. I have a suggestion. Or I attended a town hall. I want to say something else. Usually when I attend a town hall, I wait for the end of it and then I have questions and then I get everything answered.

Tyler: Okay, so that doesn't feel like something you would choose? Cause you would answer them there?

> P8: If I get it right at the town hall, I wouldn't.

Tyler: Right. Okay.

> P8: If they don't answer it right away, they call me back 2 or 3 days later.

Tyler: Yeah. Why do you think the VA is asking this?

> P8: Because a lot of people don't know they can ask questions at the town hall.

Tyler: Okay, so you think maybe this question is a way for people to learn the different reasons they can contact the VA.

> P8: Right.

> P8: Push I have a question.

Tyler: Okay, what would you do in this scenario? What would you choose? Okay. Let's do that.

Tyler: We'll choose I have a question. We're gonna click continue now.

Tyler: And now we're on this page. Can you describe this to me? What would you do here?

> P8: I would put in the box on having trouble hearing. Where do I go next?

Tyler: Yeah, would, would you write quite a short question or would you give a lot of information?

> P8: No, I'd write a short question, so when they get back to me, we can have a discussion.

Tyler: Okay. So this is just a way for you to kind of get into that conversation and then you're gonna have a more in-depth discussion.

> P8: Yeah, I put that I'm having trouble hearing so they know that it's gonna be audiology I need to contact. But the care team has to get a hold of me first and then they have to refer me to audiology.

TMyler: Yeah, right, okay. And when we type in your question here, how much longer is this form going to be?

> P8: Shouldn't be much longer.

Tyler: Yeah, what else do you think you'd need to give the VA at this point?

> P8: My contact information.

Tyler: Your contact information. Is there anything else that might be missing?

> P8: No, not on the general. This was my personal one. It would need a little more. Hope that when it goes to my personal page, it would already be on there.

Tyler: Yeah, what would already be on there?

> P8: Like my information and who my Vet Teams are.

Tyler: Yeah, okay. So if you're asking a more general question, you expect to give less information, just a way to contact you.

> P8: Yep. Yep.

Tyler: But if you're asking a more specific question, then you expect the VA to already have your information.

> P8: Right.

Tyler: That makes sense. Alright, so let's click continue. We'll say that we typed in your question.

> P8: Yeah, cause you gotta remember this all goes to, a whole bunch of people, so. Your private information will be spread around.

Tyler: Yeah, who does this go to?

> P8: Oh, let's see. There's a general mailbox and depending on which when you're sending it to like for instance for example When I email My, cardiologist at the VA in Ann Arbor, I have to email the clinic because he doesn't have a personal inbox. So the receptionist or the person at the computer when you go in gets it first, then she sends it to a different department. And sometimes whoever's doing that doesn't understand. Who my nurse is so it gets sent to another department. And then by the time it's done, it's like 6 or 15 people.

Tyler: Right, okay, so you're expecting that you your question could bounce around a lot of people's different I would see this and so you don't wanna give a ton of information about yourself. You want to just keep it short and sweet and eventually you'll talk to the right person.

> P8: Yeah, because I don't think the VA has heard about the HIPAA law.

Tyler: Okay. So what if this wasn't about healthcare? I know that's how you primarily interact with the VA, but let's say you had a question that was like, I heard about this new law and I'm confused about it and I'm trying to ask the VA about it.

> P8: Oh, then I'd go to patient advocacy.

Tyler: Okay. That makes sense. So let's look at this page.

Tyler: So it says your relationship to the veteran. How would you...

> P8: You put I'm the veteran.

Tyler: Yeah. Would you ever choose I'm the family member?

> P8: I could, I have a son that's a veteran.

Tyler: Yeah, so that's a scenario where you might be the family member asking about your son.

Tyler: Yep. That makes sense.

Tyler: Is there anything else you notice on this page?

> P8: It just asks for personal, it just says that, tells you that they're going to ask for some more personal information.

Tyler: Do you feel like at this point you have given any personal information yet?

> P8: Slightly on the last page, but not too much. I'd have to give him my contact information.

Tyler: Right, okay. Let's choose I'm the veteran and we'll click continue. Now we're on this page. What are you seeing here?

> P8: Asking me if I'm an employee and no on that.

Tyler: Okay, so it's an easy one to answer. Why is the VA asking you this?

> P8: Because benefits for employees are a little bit different than benefits for veterans unless the employee is a veteran.

Tyler: Okay, gotcha. So they're gonna have different benefits. So this is gonna answering this question will impact maybe the benefits that you Have a available to you.

> P8: Right.

Tyler: Okay. Let's click no and then we'll click continue. And now we're seeing this page. So we're gonna go through this together. We're gonna look at these questions and what I'd like to know first.

> P8: Seen this before.

Tyler: You've seen this page before? Okay. Where have you seen this page before?

> P8: When I had to contact the VA in Detroit.

Tyler: Okay, yeah, you were contacting the VA in Detroit. And how were you getting in touch with the VA in Detroit?

> P8: Through the VA. Gov.

Tyler: Okay, so you went on VA.gov. Do you remember where you went after that to find the right place?

> P8: I pushed the Detroit VA. It sent me to the Detroit page and then I message them because I have 2 different medical teams down there. And then they sent me this to fill out because they don't have my stuff on file down there because I'm associated with the Saginaw VA.

Tyler: Okay, so this is looking familiar to you from your experience of the Detroit BA. So, you know, we're looking at this and there's a lot of questions here and I'd like to know if any questions stands out to you.

> P8: Social security number.

Tyler: So I'm gonna go slowly. Social Security number, let's look at that one. Why is that stand out?

> P8: Cause this is, this is gonna go to a general mailbox.

Tyler: Okay, so what does that mean?

> P8: So a lot of people are gonna see this information. It's not gonna go to a specific Person or department.

Tyler: Right, okay. Why do you think the VA asks for your Social Security number here?

> P8: So they can locate your file.

Tyler: Okay, so they're trying to identify you – and it also has service number here. Do you know what a service number is?

> P8: That's the thing. It's the same.

Tyler: Okay, so would you give both or just one?

> P8: Just one. No, the other. Prior to Vietnam, you had a service number. After Vietnam it was the social security number that you were recognized by.

Tyler: Right, okay, so that's why we have both options, but you only need to give one. That makes sense. 

Tyler: Okay. And you had some hesitation about giving your social security number, particularly because you think a lot of people are gonna see this information.

Tyler: Is there another number or another unique identifier that you would prefer to give?

> P8: A lot of people ask for your last name initial and then the last 4 of your social security number.

Tyler: Okay. So you were, you feel more comfortable giving the last 4 digits of your Social Security number.

> P8: Yeah, with the initial of my last name.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense. Let's keep going. So now we've got we passed the Social Security and service number. What's the next?

> P8: Information but it doesn't give your whole number and that way they can't use it for any reason.

Tyler: Yeah, it feels a bit more safe. I get that. What else are we seeing now?

> P8: This is asking, how you want to be addressed. And I put my preferred name.

Tyler: Okay. You put your preferred name. Okay, so that's what you probably choose here. And then what about this one?

> P8: I see it. I would put woman because that's what I am, but a lot of people could, you know. I get why they do that. But, and they wouldn't be able to do that.

Tyler: Alright, so for both pronouns and gender, it felt like you knew what you would choose. You would choose your preferred name and you would choose woman. And you kind of understand why they're asking for that, but, it's also maybe a newer thing.

> P8: Yeah, it's new. If you did the non binary before 85. They would kick you out of the service.

Tyler: Yeah. So that's really helpful insight. So we're gonna pretend like we filled out this whole page. We clicked. You know, preferred name, woman, and then we're gonna click continue, okay?

Tyler: Alright, so. Can you describe this page to me?

> P8: Oh, it tells me what VA health facility that I'm attached to. Which I would put Saginaw. But. If I'm sending this to, like I say, because I have to do a lot of stuff out of Ann Arbor, cause they wanna keep close contact with my cardiologist. Then I put I'd still have to put Saginaw because that's where my records are kept.

Tyler: Okay, so. They're asking for your health facility and you would put Saginaw. Would you so it looks like it says search by name and it also says search by location. Which one would you use to put Saginaw?

> P8: I do search by location.

Tyler: And you type in Saginaw?

> P8: Yeah, cause all VAs have a different name. Just go by location.

Tyler: Okay, so search by name if you had to search by name, what would you put in here?

> P8: Alita. Is the first name. I can't remember the rest of it.

Tyler: So you try and remember, but it's a lot easier for you to go off of the location, which is Saginaw.

> P8: Right.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense. So we can't unfortunately type in this today. Otherwise we might try and type in Saginaw.

Tyler: But if we did use your location, it would say city, state, or postal code.

Tyler: And it sounds like you'd put in Saginaw. Today we're going to use search by name and what we're going to do is we're going to pretend like your facility starts with the word James. Instead of Alita. So we'll type in James. And now what are we seeing here?

> P8: We're seeing 5 or 6 different places. Or people.

Tyler: Okay. And so if your facility was called James J. Peters, What would you do here?

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000

> P8: I click on James J. Peters. Yep, the New York.

Tyler: You'd click on this one. Okay. Alright, we'll click on that. What are we seeing now?

> P8: Continue.

Tyler: Continue. Okay, so we see that it's selected so we can continue. Okay, let's do that. We'll continue.

Tyler: All right, before we look at this page, how much longer do you think this form is going to be?

> P8: Hopefully not much longer. I don't know why they don't put everything on one page. Like your phone number and your name goes with your email and stuff like that, on one page.

Tyler: Yeah, so, do you think this is making it feel longer? Are you surprised they're asking for your phone number and email right now?

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000

> P8: Nope.

Tyler: Okay, so it feels like the right time to ask. But you kind of wish that it was with the name and everything else.

> P8: Yeah, everything was on one page.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense. Yeah. And is there any way for us to know how much longer the form will be?

> P8: Well, it says 3 or 4 personal information. It depends on the next page asks you.

Tyler: Okay. And on this page, does this look pretty straightforward to fill in?

> P8: Yeah.

Tyler: Okay. Alright, we'll go ahead and pretend like we typed in your phone and email and we're gonna click continue. And without clicking anything yet, which option would you choose?

> P8: I always choose phone.

Tyler: You always choose phone. Okay. So you always prefer to talk to someone on the phone. You'd rather that they call you.

> P8: Yeah. Or text.

Tyler: Or text, you said? Okay. So for today, I know you would choose phone. We're actually going to choose US mail. This is just mostly so we can test the website, okay?

> P8: Okay.

Tyler: So we're pretending like you prefer to be contacted in the mail. And we're gonna click continue.

> P8: But you know, it really don't matter because they still contact you in all 3 ways.

Tyler: Okay, so you feel like your contact preference won't actually be followed anyways.

> P8: No, cause I usually get a phone call and then I get an email and then I get a letter, then I get a text.

Tyler: Right. So even if you put in phone, you think that they might email you, they might mail you something. They might even text you. Right, that's helpful to know.

> P8: Yes.

Tyler: Okay, so now we're putting in it looks like our country where you receive mail. Can you describe this page to me, what are you seeing here?

> P8: They want to know if you're in the military where if you're outside of the country, you either have an FPO or an APO, that makes a big difference. Or if you're in country they want to know what state you're in. But state you're in, okay, so it's either you're out of the country and it's an APO or an FPO. Or it's asking for your state.

Tyler: Okay, so what would you click on? You'll have to just tell me.

> P8: The state.

Tyler: You click on the state. Okay, so I'm gonna open that.

> P8: United States.

Tyler: Now what are we seeing? Okay, so we'll click on United States. And then we'll click continue.

> P8: Yep.

Tyler: Okay. Alright. And now we're on this page.

> P8: Hello, this could be on the same page as your contact info with the phone number and the email.

Tyler: Okay, so it should be phone number, email, and mailing address altogether.

> P8: Yup, and then at the bottom, how do, how do you want contact?

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense. Do you think that would save you time?

> P8: Save time and save everybody a lot of energy.

Tyler: Energy too, okay, that's helpful. So now we're looking at this page and it's asking for your mailing address. Is there anything that stands out to you besides the fact that it's on its own page?

> P8: No.

Tyler: Okay, so this looks pretty standard. Okay, so we'll pretend like we typed in your street address and everything else and then we'll click continue. And what's this page asking for?

> P8: It's asking for a proper address because sometimes You put in your address. And the VA shows the last 4 digits of the zip code. So it gets to the precise location of where you're at.

Tyler: Okay, so this is something you've seen before on another form and you would, would you usually choose the suggestion it sounds like?

> P8: I usually choose what I entered.

Tyler: Okay, you usually choose what you entered. You don't take their suggestion. Okay, so you would switch this and you would click what you entered.

Tyler: We'll pretend like we did and I'll click continue.

Tyler: Alright, so now how much longer do you think this form is gonna be?

> P8: This is the end, but it's not going to be.

Tyler: This is the end. Okay, but it's not going to be you think there'll be another couple of pages?

> P8: Yes, because you gotta go with the category of the topic of question you want to ask. And then you gotta go with your question. Then you gotta add more personal information that they've already asked you in the last 3 pages. And then you submit the question.

Tyler: Okay, so this is gonna ask for a little bit more from each of these sections.

> P8: You're repeating some information.

Tyler: Okay, right. That makes sense. So I'm gonna what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna click on category and topic.

> P8: The military. This is right up that alley, cause they do that a lot.

Tyler: Yeah, the military. What can you tell me what they do a lot?

> P8: They ask you repeatedly. The same questions over and over again. So if you're filling out a form, you get the first page filled out. You go to the second page, you got a little bit of new information to fill out. Then as you're getting down the page, you gotta answer the same information that you answered on the first page. And it continues...

Tyler: Gotcha. Right. So your experience in the military is that you will have to repeat yourself and now you feel like that's what's gonna happen on this page.

> P8: Right, because you are, cause it says personal information.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. All right, let's click on category and topic and we'll see, what happens. So what just happened? What are we seeing now?

> P8: Healthcare or audiology. There's another thing you need to put on here. Vision and Dental.

Tyler: Oh, okay. So you think there should be a couple more options at this point?

> P8: If you wanna do hearing, you might as well do dental and vision.

Tyler: Okay. Why does it say hearing? Here. Where does that come from?

> P8: Just hearing is a lot of issues with a lot of veterans.

Tyler: Is there a reason that we're seeing health care and hearing right now?

> P8: Yeah, because hearing is 98% of Veterans issues.

Tyler: Okay, so we're seeing it because it's a really common problem.

> P8: Right, but so is vision and so is dental.

Tyler: Right, okay. Yeah, I can see that. So let's click on your question next and we'll look at this one, okay? So tell me what you're seeing here.

> P8: Okay, it says, what is your question about? Did that so this is kind of redundant. The reason you're contacting us is I have a question which is kind of redundant because that's what you clicked when you first started into all this. And then it says I wanna have my hearing checked, which, yeah, that's good. But not – have we done it because that was answered in the first page too.

Tyler: Right, okay. So you already answered these questions. So why is it showing up? Again, here.

> P8: I don't know, but that's kind of weird.

Tyler: Yeah, okay. That makes sense. I can see how that's a little weird. So we're gonna click on personal information now.

> P8: I already answered all this.

Tyler: Alright, so, You already answered all this? Okay, I'll keep scrolling and we'll see if there's anything else we're noticing.

> P8: Now if you do the social security number, you don't need the data. Especially when it's going to a general mailbox. And I'd still prefer to have my J and then my last 4. Instead of the whole self security number.

Tyler: Right. Yeah, I hear you.

> P8: Cause that's a VA identifier. And it gets, even out of state VAs ask for my identifier, which is my J and then my last 4.

Tyler: Right, yeah, so Definitely still concerned about giving your full Social Security number. That makes sense.

> P8: Well, here's the problem. Somebody used my cell security number to get a job in Utah. Oh yeah, so now I'm in the middle of getting that straightened out because Social Security has decided they're going to cut my SSI benefits because I was working in 2022.

Tyler: Oh gosh, what a mess. So that experience has made you even more cautious about having to give your social security number...

> P8: And my birthday because any you can they have they can do that.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. I can totally see why you would be wary of typing it in this form.

> P8: Yep, we answered all this stuff. We already answered all this stuff, right?

Tyler: Okay. Can we change any of this stuff?

> P8: Not really, cause we've already done all this. Now if they say what this should be, what this page should be. If the information you gave us, should we change anything?

Tyler: Right. Okay, so it should be. Kind of a chance for you to check your answers. Right, okay, and it doesn't feel like it's like that right now.

> P8: Yeah.

> P8: No, although it says that you're going down everything one step at a time, but if you had everything on one thing and then it said Edit, then you can go up and change what you want. Instead of having to go through this whole page.

Tyler: Okay, I'm gonna click on edit so we can see what that looks like, okay?

Tyler: Alright, so what are we seeing now?

> P8: Same where I can change my number or my email contact.

Tyler: Okay. Is this is this working differently to how you want it to work?

> P8: No, it's the usual.

Tyler: Yeah, it's the usual, okay. So now that we found the edit button, maybe this page makes more sense. But it wasn't easy to find.

> P8: Yeah. I do, but here's what I'm seeing. All of this to be on one thing. So when you push the edit button. Everything pops up and you can change everything at once.

Tyler: Right, okay, you don't wanna have to go through sections.

> P8: No, cause I have a I have condition called packs Pasture or theesthetic techicardia syndrome. The longer I sit down at a computer to do this. There's a chance that when I stand up, I'm going to pass out.

Tyler: Right, okay, so it's important for you that this happens much more quickly than it's happened.

> P8: Right.

Tyler: And, and that's also present here on this page. You wish you could edit. Everything at once instead of going through sections.

> P8: Right.

Tyler: That makes sense. So. Can we edit this one? It says, how should we contact you US mail? Can we edit that?

> P8: Edit mailing address.

Tyler: Oh, okay. So we click edit down here. Right, okay.

> P8: Right. The other problem.

Tyler: Alright, so I'm gonna give you a second to read this page and then I'd love for you to tell me what you learned from this page.

> P8: Thanks to me for asking the question and that somebody will be in contact with me and I better write down that reference number. So if I need to get back with them. I have a way to get to the question I asked them.

Tyler: Okay. So the reference number is important for you to remember. So you're gonna write it down on a notepad or how are you gonna remember that?

> P8: I'm gonna write it down on anything at my hand at the time that I'm doing this.

Tyler: That makes sense. Alright, is there anything else you learned from this page?

> P8: That it's the end.

Tyler: It's the end, yeah. How, what's your next step besides writing down your reference number?

> P8: Yeah, you close it out.

Tyler: Okay.

> P8:  I close it out. For them to get back to me. Unless of course it's more important than I call the VA and tell them what I did. That way they can help you sooner.

Tyler: Okay, how long do you think it's gonna take to get a response with your answer?

> P8: Usually with my VA in S and my health issues, it takes 2 to 3 days.

Tyler: Okay, so you're hoping it takes about 2 to 3 days.

> P8: I've had friends that, it's taken longer. It's taken less time. Depending on because my friend with cancer her doctor gets back to her within one to 2 days.

Tyler: Gotcha. Okay. So I'm gonna stop sharing my screen and we can keep talking for the last few minutes, okay?

> P8: Okay, and then I have a friend whose doctor gets back to him in 2 to 3 weeks. Because they're medical issues, there's just. They only see the VA once a year, so.

Tyler: So when it's more urgent or it's somebody that has more urgent needs, then you're expecting it to be sooner.

> P8: Right.

Tyler: That totally makes sense and I think that definitely makes sense in terms of health care especially. Remember when we thought about like a general question, like what if it was a general question you had about a law that had just been passed?

Tyler: How would that change your expectations?

> P8: Well, I would expect within the next 7 to 14 days. Unless it's directly affecting my medical.

Tyler: Okay. Yeah. And when we think about this process, we didn't sign in at the beginning, right? We just continued without signing in.

> P8: Right. That's why I was concerned about Social Security number.

Tyler: Right. So if you signed in, how do you think it would be different? What would be different.

> P8: I wouldn't put my social security number. They'd know who I was.

Tyler: Yeah, you wouldn't have to give the Social Security number. What other information?

> P8: No, and they'd have my birthday already and they'd have my address. They'd have my email and they'd have my phone number.

Tyler: Yeah. So they'd have a lot of your information already.

> P8: So. Right, all I would have to do is ask my question.

Tyler: Okay. Would you need to review the information they have about you or would you just expect them to have the right information and you don't need to even see it?

> P8: I review my information every 3 months with the VA.

Tyler: Okay, so you expect that it's up to date. So really your expectation is I sign in and then I ask you my question.

> P8: Right.

Tyler: Yeah, so this feels quite different to that. Okay. I can definitely see some things that could be easier and could make this a lot faster.

Tyler: It was really helpful for you. To explain things that you think should come together on one page.

> P8: Yeah, if you can condense them all the one page, one grouping. Because it's all the same. Basically, you put it all on one page. Then, it cuts time and People aren't as frustrated.

Tyler: Yeah. That makes sense. I can see why that has that.

> P8: If you've ever been in the military. You would truly understand.

Tyler: Yeah, I'm sure. Well, that's why it's been so helpful for me to chat with you today.

> P8: That's why veterans get frustrated with the VA because it's a lot of redundancy.

Tyler: That makes sense. So, I've asked you a ton of questions, [P8], and I think you've answered all of them. So thank you so much for for doing that. Oh, it's not your fault at all.

> P8: Oh, you're welcome and sorry about the delay. Yes, I got the crazy cat. That's my fault.

Tyler: Well, yeah, I guess it's the cat's fault, but, I appreciate you getting yourself set up this morning and then working with me to kind of like come up with a backup plan.

Tyler: I do want to give you a last couple of minutes to ask me any questions. Do you have any questions for me?

> P8: No, everything was straightforward, so I understand what you're doing.

Tyler: Okay, awesome. Well, I really.

> P8: I'm pretty computer lit thanks to the Navy, so.

Tyler: Yeah, no, you, you definitely were really helpful. All of your feedback was useful and you noticed a lot of things that other veterans might not notice. Or that I didn't notice myself. So I really appreciate your time. Perigean, they're the people who set up this research session, they're going to send you a note when we finish and it's gonna have some information that you can pass along to other veterans if they want to take part in.

> P8: Thank you. I share. I know a couple of friends that. Like to do this so I share.

Tyler: Oh good, that's great. Well, I think that's all for me if you have any other questions you can email, pair of, and they'll, they'll get back to you. And I hope you have a lovely rest of your day.

Tyler: Awesome. Well, thank you so much.

> P8: Oh, thank you and I really appreciate what you're doing.

Tyler: Awesome. Thank you, [P8]. Have a good one.

> P8: You too. Bye.
