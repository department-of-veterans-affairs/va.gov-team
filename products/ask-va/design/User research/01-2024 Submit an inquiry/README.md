# About this research

## Study
[2024-01 Ask VA: Submit an inquiry (1) #453](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/453)

## Background
Ask VA (AVA) is an online portal that allows Veterans, caregivers and others to submit questions to VA and receive a secure response. Currently, AVA resides within a stand-alone Microsoft portal that is inconsistent with VA design standards, is not mobile-friendly, and has accessibility issues. 

We need to move AVA to VA.gov. It should be mobile friendly, accessible and easy to submit an issue and receive updates and information that results in a final resolution. Ultimately, we want AVA to feel part of a cohesive and user-centered approach to support. This [product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/products/ask-va-phase-1-product-outline.md) includes more details about the scope of Phase 1 of our work.

## Research goals
* Review whether Veterans understand when they need to authenticate and the benefits of authentication
* Review the experience of a Veteran asking a question about their own benefits
* Understand what Veterans expect to happen after they submit a question

## Recruitment
We are working with Perigean to recruit Veterans for this research.

## Date
This research took place in January and February 2024.
