## Background

Ask VA (AVA) is an online portal that allows Veterans, caregivers and others to submit questions to VA and receive a secure response. Currently, AVA resides within a stand-alone Microsoft portal that is inconsistent with VA design standards, is not mobile-friendly, and has accessibility issues. 

We need to move AVA to VA.gov. It should be mobile friendly, accessible and easy to submit an issue and receive updates and information that results in a final resolution. Ultimately, we want AVA to feel part of a cohesive and user-centered approach to support. This [product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/products/ask-va-phase-1-product-outline.md) includes more details about the scope of Phase 1 of our work.

### OCTO priorities

This research supports the following OCTO FY24 priority:

* Better experiences: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.

### Veteran journey

Ask VA can support Veterans, their family members, and other submitters at many stages of the Veteran journey. They may use Ask VA when they’re separating up until aging.

## Research goals

The key goals of this study are to:

* Review the experience of a Veteran asking a question about their own benefits
* Review whether Veterans understand when they need to authenticate and the benefits of authentication
* Understand what Veterans expect to happen after they submit a question

### Outcome

This research will help us determine if and how we need to improve the design and content of our Phase 1 redesign. It will also inform our research objectives for Round 2.

### Research questions

Review the experience of a Veteran asking a question about their own benefits:
* Is the purpose of Ask VA clear?
* Is there information missing on any question, page or sequence of pages?
* Are there too many or too few fields per page?
* Is it clear why each question is being asked?
* Do users understand how to edit their answers on the review page?

Review whether Veterans understand when they need to authenticate and the benefits of authentication:
* Is it clear when you need to authenticate vs. when it’s optional?
* Are the other benefits of authenticating clear?

Understand what Veterans expect to happen after they submit a question:
* Is it clear what happens after you submit a question?
* Are there any surprises or outstanding questions after reading information on the submission page?

### Hypotheses

1. Some users will think authentication is required in order to ask any question.
2. Most Veterans will find the form fields are straightforward and intuitive to use.
3. Some users will be surprised at the amount of information they have to give in order to ask a question.
4. Some users will misinterpret the chapter numbers as the number of pages, and be surprised at the length of the form.
5. Some users will be confused about which information they can edit on the review page and which they cannot.
6. Most users will expect an estimate of how long it will take to receive a reply.

## Methodology

This will be a moderated usability study conducted remotely over Zoom. We will use a Figma prototype with limited interactivity.

We will test the following steps:
* Start page
* Chapter 1: Category and topic
* Chapter 2: Your question
* Chapter 3: Personal information
  * Only ‘My own benefits; I’m the Veteran’ branch
* Chapter 4: Review and submit
* Submission page
