# About this research

## Study
This research involved a workshop with School Certifying Officials (SCOs) to understand how they use the Ask VA dashboard. There is no associated issue in the [Research Repository](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/880).

## Background
Ask VA (AVA) is an online portal that allows Veterans, caregivers, and supporting personnel in education, debt, loans, etc. to submit questions to VA and receive a secure message response. Currently, Ask VA (AVA) resides within a stand-alone Microsoft portal that is inconsistent with the VA design standards, is not mobile-friendly, and has accessibility issues.

We met with School Certifying Officials (SCOs) to understand how they currently use the Ask VA dashboard and what updates or features would be most beneficial to them. We engaged with SCOs because they are users who typically have a large volume of Ask VA inquiries, which means their dashboard is more "full" and used more frequently.

Review the [Mural board](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1694439082995/b37a804f76e3eae53b295792c422244fef6bda9f) where we took notes during this workshop.

## Research goals
* Understand the information you need to see when you log into Ask VA
* Understand when & why you need to filter and sort inquiries
* Explore different ways to view business & personal inquiries
* Understand the information you need to see when you open inquiry details

## Recruitment
We recruited two SCOs through the GI Bill team.

## Date
This research took place in September 2023.
