Tyler: So I just want to confirm you're comfortable. If I record my screen and audio today.

> P8: Yes.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: Awesome. Any other questions for me. At this point [P8]?

> P8: No, not yet.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: Well, before we look at a couple of prototypes, I also wanted to just learn a little bit more about you and your experience with the Va. How long have you been a veteran.

> P8: Since 1980.

Tyler: Okay And have you been interacting with the Va since 1980 or a little bit later in your life?

> P8: A little bit later. I mean, there was some initial Va. Interaction in 1980 81.

Tyler: But then it was pretty quiet until about 2015.

Tyler: Okay, Gotcha. And these days, how do you usually engage with the Va.

> P8: Well, we're back to some in person. Visits. Quite a bit has been via telehealth. Mind you, the vas telehealth app.

> P8: I don't know if it even does yet I don't think so. Does not have captioning. So that was a great problem for me, because.

> P8: I would be on the Va video messaging video chat and talking to my doctor, who's in the office in a room with some other people, so he had to wear a mask. and they didn't have captioning and wouldn't take his mask off like, understandably, I couldn't be mad about that. But I just you know it did not work for me.

> P8: my mental health professional that I've been seeing for a few years. I he was very good to go outside the platform to Webex.

Tyler: Hmm.

> P8: That that to use in some different facilities which does have captioning, and that work pretty good.

Tyler: Okay, Gotcha. So maybe, did you welcome the return to being able to see people in person? If that's the case.

> P8: Yes and no.

> P8: I mean the video from home is a more comfortable environment with less anxiety of surrounding noises, and so forth, of that which I.

> P8: I have [health details] hearing loss. I have [health details], and I have [health details]. So I'm affected by environmental sounds quite a bit


Tyler: That makes sense. What about calling the Va. Do you ever call the Va. On the phone?

> P8: Yes. Mind you, hold times and actually getting to who you want to talk to is is a little different, but it used more for appointment making than to discuss something with somebody.

Tyler: Okay, do you have any issues when you're calling over the phone with your hearing loss or your hearing aids.

> P8: Sometimes I have connectivity issues. But for the most part, no.


Tyler: Okay, what about online. I know, you said, you use telehealth, do you also message, your doctors, online?

> P8: I do I've used my healtheVet extensively, and did a lot of messaging with a lot of people on that.

Tyler: Okay. How do you find that?

> P8: It works pretty good. Granted there was period of time that getting directly to who I wanted to message was not  direct. In other words, I used to directly be able to email my my mental health professional. And then something changed where I could only get an email or a message to the Department.

> P8: And that affected confidentiality and candidness in my messaging, because it wasn't going straight to his message box.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. That's quite a different experience. I can see how like speaking directly to your care provider versus a department of people you might not know.

> P8: Yeah. And and primary care kind of goes that way, too, because you can get a message to the care team, but not.

> P8: Directly to the doctor.

> P8: And I'm probably going into too much information. But I had an instance with one of my primary care doctors care team members in which I was going to a specialist appointment. They've made an appointment for me and this in individual, and I had some confrontation [... redacted ...] she flagged me as a hostile person.

> P8: We seem to have got past that to a point, but I'm still reluctant, therefore, to communicate with the team. Because is it this individual that is getting the message? And will it be relayed correctly to the doctor, or something.

Tyler: Yeah. that that sounds yeah. Like an unfortunate situation. I could see how it would impact you wanting to be clear about who you're talking to.

> P8: It has long term effect with your care with the institution, because.

> P8: Bring up your account, and like I was talking to an appointment setter one day. Nice guy. I've known him for a long time, and he said, Oh, yeah, I can see that your account has kind of been flagged, you know, so I'm like, Oh, crap!

Tyler: Oh!

> P8: Have to be careful what I say and how I say it.

> P8: Anyway.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I think we might. That might come up later in our conversation, just thinking about who we're talking to, and whether or not that's clear. And things like that.

Tyler: interesting a couple quick questions have you ever used? Ask Va.

> P8: I don't believe so.

Tyler: Okay. And what about the Va Chatbot.

> P8: No.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: and we, we sort of talked around this. But when we think about a good experience contacting the Va, what's the most important thing to you?

> P8: Talking electronically or verbally, like.

Tyler: Either one. If it's helpful to make a distinction, you can.

> P8: Sorry my mind is going off. Could you repeat the question.

Tyler: That's okay. So when you think about your experience contacting the Va, what is the most important thing to you.

> P8: Being listened to, and getting directed to the appropriate parties for the intended call.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense.

Tyler: So the response that you receive from the va is the most important thing and that knowing that they've listened to you, and that they're kind of giving you a solution or sending you to the right place.

> P8: Correct.

Tyler: Awesome. All right. I'm going to shift gears. We're gonna talk a little bit about something different now. So one thing we're gonna talk about today is automation.

Tyler: And when I say automation, I'm thinking about when a computer does something that usually a human would do so it could be like having a helper who summarizes an article for you or gives you a recommendation. For example.

Tyler: do you know, if you've ever used an online tool that includes some type of automation.

> P8: Other than like grammar, check and spell check things of that nature. No.

Tyler: Yeah, that's I mean, that's a good example.

Tyler: I wonder do you think that it's always obvious when you're when something is automated?

> P8: Is it always obvious?

> P8: Not necessarily. I don't believe.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: when I talk about automation, like, if I said, you know, we're gonna use this tool and it it has some things are automated within it. Do you have any hesitations or concerns about that?

> P8: Hub not off hand. I maybe that depends upon the on the subject matter.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense.

Tyler: I think we will talk about that some more as we go on but this is a good moment for us to get set up with one of these prototypes, so.

> P8: Okay.

Tyler: Have you ever shared your screen on? Zoom on your phone before.

> P8: I actually have not.

Tyler: Okay, that's not a problem. So you're on. Zoom, you can see my face right now, right.

> P8: Correct.

Tyler: Okay. So if you click on the screen like just somewhere on where you can see my face, you should see some controls come up on the bottom.

Tyler: Do you see a list? It might say, like, share, chat.

Tyler: react. Do you see anything like that?

> P8: I see mute stop video participants chat reactions. Yeah, they're share.

Tyler: So let's click on share and then we're gonna want to share your screen.

> P8: Alrighty!

Tyler: Right, and then at some point it'll ask you to start the broadcast.

> P8: That's can you see it now or not?

Tyler: Yeah.

> P8: Okay, this permission would appear on top.

Tyler: Permissions came up.

> P8: Oh, it's yeah. It's asking me.

> P8: select what individual apps it wants.

Tyler: Okay, so it might mean that you haven't given zoom permission yet.

> P8: Or no. Kinda see? Show system. Add ups some jobs.

Tyler: Perfect.

> P8: Whoops.

Tyler: It looks like I can see your screen now, [P8].

Tyler: did I lose you? Oh.

> P8: No, I'm here. I see that looks like it's switched. My video. I see you, but I don't see what we're looking at.

Tyler: So you can see me that that's okay. We can. We can leave it on this page for a minute.

> P8: Okay.

Tyler: So if you click on the screen, kind of anywhere on the screen.

Tyler: See how we have those controls again. At the bottom, we need to find the one that says Chat.

> P8: Chat. Okay?

Tyler: Okay, cool.

Tyler: We found the chat. So I'm going to send you a link in the chat.

Tyler: Bear with me 1Â min.

Tyler: all right. So I just sent a link and then if you go ahead and click on that link.

Tyler: it's perfect, so it'll start to open up and we'll give it a minute to load.

> P8: Oh, by the way, do you know, do different browsers interact or have difficulty with your development team or anything cause? I'm using the brave.

> P8: the brave browser. Okay, just yeah.

Tyler: Yeah, that's a good question. So right now, we should be okay on any browser. With this prototype.

> P8: Okay.

Tyler: So let me tell you a little bit about this before we do anything.

Tyler: And I just wanna check in. You can hear me. Okay, and your captions are still coming through with the website up.

> P8: Captions are not coming through, but I can hear you if I lean into it, so to speak.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: Is it helpful if I talk like a little bit louder.

> P8: No, not necessarily because I.

Tyler: Okay.

> P8: Cases. I'll just ask you to repeat anything that I don't get. I tend to miss the 1st portion

> P8: of a sentence, and because of that my mind dwells on what was said that I.

> P8: Get, and therefore I miss continuing conversation. So I'll do my best to interrupt and get you to repeat early for this.

Tyler: Perfect thanks. That's helpful context. And I'm more than happy to repeat myself. So we're looking at a website now. We are pretending like we're on va.gov with this prototype.

Tyler: and we are we've got we've come to va.gov to use this tool called. Ask Va. Ask, Va is a form that you can use to ask the Va. A question. So your question could be about anything it could be about education. It could be about disability compensation. But we're going to fill out a form, and we're going to send it to the Va. And the Va. Is going to get back to you with a response.

Tyler: Does that all sound clear so far.

> P8: It does. You know the veteran and the confidential guy in me says, Okay, who's it going to at the Va. You know.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: I wondered if you were gonna say that because of obviously from our pre, the earlier in our conversation. So immediately, you're wondering who's actually gonna be answering my question, which is helpful.

> P8: Correct, correct. Is is it going to the applicable people, or is it somebody that's just trying to move on to the next question from the next person. Yeah.

Tyler: Yeah, yeah, I can see how that would be important to know.

Tyler: Okay, so we're gonna look at 3 different versions of this. I'm gonna call them concepts or prototypes. So we're gonna look at 3 different concepts. And in all 3 concepts, you're asking the Va the same question.

Tyler: But things are going to happen a little bit differently. So they're going to feel familiar. And then they're going to feel a little different. Okay? And we're going to go through each of these concepts together. I'll ask you some questions, and then we'll go to the next concept.

> P8: And holy locks. Concept. Okay?

### Concept B

Tyler: All right. So let's start with this one.

Tyler: Tell me what you would do on this page.

> P8: I would on this page I would click in the box and type the text of my question.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: so we can't actually type in this prototype today so what we're gonna do is click in the box

Tyler: and then we're going to have a question appear.

> P8: We're good.

Tyler: So I'll give you a minute to read this. This is going to be our question for the day.

> P8: Okay, that that is a very applicable question for me. Devices, and so forth. Yes.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So yeah, we're asking the Va about mobility or assistive devices. And what would you do next on this page after you typed your question.

> P8: Click, continue.

Tyler: Okay, let's do that.

> P8: Sure.

> P8: Of course I would also scroll down, see what else is on the page which I'm doing. Okay, I'll click. Continue.

Tyler: Okay, all right.

Tyler: And now I'll give you a moment to read this page, and before you click on anything, I'd just like you to tell me what you are noticing on this page.

> P8: Oh, I see they're trying to lead me somewhere. This suggestions based on some of the questions other veterans.

> P8: and they're assuming what they think I'm asking by saying that it's about compensation, or how it relates to a claim.

> P8: It gives me the option to edit my question. And I'm thinking. Okay, I could rephrase it and try and sound more intentive on my  area of question as opposed to being too broad.

> P8: Seem to give me a chance to call somebody. But I'm like, Yeah, I'll be on hold for 45Â min if I do that and give me a chance offer feedback. which we as veterans, ought to well know how to do.

Tyler: That was really helpful. How you went through the page. Let's talk about a couple things you mentioned. Immediately. You said, Okay, they're making. They're giving some suggestions, and they're making an assumption. Tell me about that. What are they making an assumption about?

> P8: Oh, they're making an assumption that I want compensation. Or I want to file a claim when, in my mind with my question, would have my intent would have been, what tools are there for me to help with my disability in mobility and hearing and revision.

Tyler: Right. Okay. So it seems like they offered a suggestion or they made an assumption. And it's it doesn't fit what you would expect.

> P8: It feels like it's taken me down a different road than if I'm if I'm pretending. I texted that question. It feels like it's sending me down a different road, and I'm not going to get the answer. I want.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: Gotcha. So it's made an assumption. It's taking you down a different route than where you want to go. And then it. You also mentioned. It offers the option to edit

Tyler: something. What can you edit? And what would that do?

> P8: It appears that I could edit and rephrase my question.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: okay? And if you if you did that, let's say you edited or you rephrased your question, what would you hope happens after that?

> P8: Then I would get a more defined or more relatable answer to my question.

Tyler: Okay.

> P8: So I would feel like I'm in the right compartment.

Tyler: Okay, gotcha.

Tyler: How did it make the assumption that your question is about disability, compensation, or why.

> P8: How did it do that? That's a good question.

> P8: Why? Because they think all veterans are looking for the money train. More so than they need help coping with their disabilities and tools to help them function more as a normal person.

Tyler: Okay, so do you think they're saying that this is about disability compensation? Because

Tyler: veterans commonly ask about disability compensation? Or that's not exactly what you mean.

> P8: That's not exactly what I mean. I mean, what do I mean by that? Actually?

> P8: Why did they automatically assume, I want to ask about compensation.  Or a claim.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P8: New or otherwise to me. I would have thought that would have been better if it came back and said something like, You know we understand what your question is. Here's the possibility of  of avenues. We think you might be looking for information, and then maybe give me a dropdown list with some bullets that I could click on. Yes, I want something about hearing or vision loss. Are you asking about disability claims? A radio button that you could click so you could.

> P8: You could be sure in your mind that you were either going or not going there. back with a dropdown. And said, are you interested in hearing mobility vision are you seeking claims information and it's like a flow chart, you know, yeah.

> P8: help direct you in the proper way, because, right now, it feels like you're in a big vat of information, and they just automatically defaulted to you to. I want to file a claim and get money.

Tyler: Yeah, I can see that.

Tyler: I wonder if part of it is, is it more helpful if they make a suggestion if they give you a couple of suggestions. So there's a few options.

Tyler: Is that more helpful.

> P8: Oh! Could you repeat that.

Tyler: Yeah, of course. Do you think there's a difference like, is it more helpful if you're given a couple of suggestions instead of one suggestion.

> P8: Yeah.

> P8: Yeah, I mean, you know, mind you, there's gotta be a way to narrow the scope of interest and what the questions implying. So I would think the more suggestions that were offered if there was a way to select and deselect.

> P8: Seems like it would be good.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: And you also talked about how you wanted to have maybe, like some lists with like bullets that you could click on. So you're hoping, are you hoping to end up with some information that could help answer your question?

> P8: Yes.

Tyler: Okay.

> P8: Right as well as have that confident feeling that it is gonna get directed to somebody in the area of expertise which you're inquiring about.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: that's really helpful. So it's partially because you want to get information. And it's also it'll give you confidence that you're sending the question to the right.

Tyler: The person who has expertise in prosthetics, for example, or.

> P8: Exactly.

Tyler: Disability compensation. Yeah, okay, that's really helpful.

> P8: So it could be not been. You know, some simplified bullets that you are radio buttons that you could select, where where you're looking for prosthetics where you're looking for claims help, or you're looking for some medical intervention, or whatever.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense.

Tyler: All right. I think what we can do. Now, is go ahead and click edit, we're going to pretend like you edited your question.

Tyler: and we can't type in this prototype. But you told me you would probably rephrase your question right.

> P8: I definitely would [rephrase my question]. I don't wanna hear about, the claims and stuff, you know. That's you know, if you're a disabled veteran you have gone through so much.

> P8: I'm not gonna use that word crap.

> P8: That you don't want to open that can of worms and get down that whole thing where people start examining, reexamining, but and so forth. You know.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. What do you think you would write in this in this? When you rephrase your question so that you avoid falling into the disability compensation path.

> P8: Well, you know, I guess part of that would be the background of why I wrote this question in the 1st place, so.

> P8: What resources that for veterans support mobility or assisted devices. I would define that if I was looking.

> P8: For I'm gonna take out the mobility part because I'm walking okay? And I'm I'm needing assistant devices, let's say, for hearing or putting on my socks.

> P8: I would either a go for what technology resources are available or veterans who need support with hearing loss.

Tyler: yeah, so you're making it more specific right?

> P8: Yeah, or like, like, I've been pushing the Va.

> P8: Which you can't kind of get to the person that need. You need to for teaching veterans with hearing loss. American sign language. They offer nothing.

> P8: you know, unless you want to get into vocational rehab, or go to go to college, you know, or whatever. But if you've got hearing loss, you've got Ptsd, you've got hyper occluses. You're not going to get in a crowd.

> P8: That's why I would be very defining in my question.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P8: I don't want to be given the answer that I've already heard so many times before.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

> P8: Off on a personal thing there too much, but.

Tyler: No, no, that's really helpful. It's really helpful to hear about what you're thinking through, and I can, and I can like I have a good sense now of how you would rewrite your questions so that you end up in the right place. Let's do this. We can't type in the prototype. So just click in that question box for me.

Tyler: And we're gonna pretend, like you have rephrased your question. So it's slightly more specific. In this case. It says, I need automobile adaptive equipment. I know that's different to your scenario, but it's a similar.

> P8: No, that's fine.

Tyler: Similar thought, yeah, so let's click update.

> P8: So so question, is the idea with this updating this field to not alter the original question, but to append it with more definitive like the statement that you've added at the end of it.

Tyler: Well, that's a good question. In this case it looks like we've added a sentence to our original question.

Tyler: But what do you think you would expect or hope it would do?

Tyler: Do you think it would replace.

> P8: I could see a couple of different ways. I mean, I can see the advantage of retaining the original question and further clarifying your the intent of the question

> P8: cause you know how texting you text somebody. They always get the wrong darn assumption or message right for texting your family members.

> P8: What I said. I asked you a question gave me a different answer. Anyway. I could see where like, if the original question was still shown and the update below it. So it's kind of like more filters.

> P8: Question process goes on in case it lets me edit again.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. That makes a lot of sense. So it's almost like.

> P8: And I get okay getting in and out of the car.

Tyler: Oh, I think maybe the speed got all funny. Can you hear me?

> P8: I can hear you. Yes.

Tyler: Okay, I think you sped up all of a sudden. But as long as you can hear me now, I I heard what you were saying.

Tyler: alright! That makes a lot of sense. I could see how it would be something like a like, tell us more about your question, and then it would be like, Here's our suggestion. And then you'd say, Oh, but it's actually about this, right? So it's a little.

> P8: So maybe like, if the original question was the same font and the same boldness, and you added more clarifying information.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P8: You're kind of pioneering that into the direct question. Going out.

Tyler: Yeah, what's the difference between that experience? And then using a chat? Bot.

Tyler: if you're familiar with the chat.

> P8: Well, yeah, I am familiar with chats. I have a fair amount of background in information technology and so forth. So anyway.

> P8: At least in the chat you can say no, that's not what I meant. I'm not asking about disability. I'm asking about technological assistant devices or no. I need help with my car. I don't need help with a claim, and usually you can get a direct response. Oh, I misunderstood you, or something in that nature, and you get that feedback from the other end rather than feeling like you're talking in the mirror.

Tyler: that makes sense. So there's more of like a feedback loop and it's easier for you to maybe correct

Tyler: yeah the thing yeah.

> P8: Yeah.

Tyler: Cool.

Tyler: Okay, let's move forward. So let's go ahead and click update.

Tyler: And then we're going to click. Continue.

> P8: There it goes!

Tyler: Okay. And now tell me what we're seeing on this page.

> P8: Okay.

> P8: obviously, I'm being told that it could take 7 business days to get an answer to my question.

> P8: And now I'm getting a little bit feedback which I like. The suggestion is based on similar questions that other veterans have asked.

> P8: Let's see. And now I get the okay. This is what we think you're talking about.

> P8: We think your question is about healthcare relates to prosthetics. Is that correct?

> P8: And that answer would be like to me. Oh, gosh, yes or no? Or do I want to update my question again? to me. I'm not actually thinking, okay, if I was looking for the car mobility automotive solutions. Whatever you know.

> P8: I'm thinking maybe I'm not talking about prosthetics, so I feel like it's still not taking me. To the right place.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P8: That's no. Let me select my category topic that has potential for oh, we want to press that.

Tyler: Are you wanting to press it?

> P8: Yeah, so that I can define my ask more specifically, because, you know, I'm maybe into this for 10-15Â min already. But feeling like this process is not gonna get me where I want to go.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: So it's like, if their suggestion is wrong, and then it's wrong again. then you'd probably rather just make the decision yourself right?

> P8: Yeah, yeah, because 2 or 3 errors. And I'm gonna close the app and say, typical, Va, they're not less than it.

Tyler: Yeah, for sure. I could see that. Let's click. No, and we'll continue.

> P8: Okay.

> P8: Yeah.

Tyler: Was this what you expected to see?

> P8: Yes, yes, maybe a little earlier on like after the 1st response to that question.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P8: Hey? You need a member on your team. No. Just kidding.

> P8: Oh, disability, compensation benefits inside, outside life insurance readiness employment.

> P8: So I got categories. Some, I think, are applicable. Some are How did they get? I was talking about surviving benefits, you know. That doesn't quite seem applicable. Life insurance survivor benefits. Maybe this is a very general category. Selection.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P8: Maybe.

Tyler: Okay.

> P8: Yeah, maybe a footnote there, that's saying, some of these selections may not directly relate to your question.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: So you're still expecting that these categories will relate to your question. And you're just. And your role as the person choosing is to be picking the most specific one.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P8: I'm trying to get help. I don't want to be in the hamster wheel of everything else.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

### Concept C

Tyler: So this has been really helpful. I think. Let's move on because I see the time. And I do want to have time for the other 2 prototypes. So we are.

Tyler: let me actually try something. I'm gonna send a link in the chat, and I think it might just show up on the top of your screen. Let's see if that happens.

> P8: Okay.

Tyler: Hmm! I'm not seeing it come up, so I think we need to get ourselves back to zoom

Tyler: do you know how to navigate back to Zoom, so you might need to find all of your applications. Sometimes you like, swipe up on the bottom of your phone and you'll be able to see your applications.

> P8: Down on android shows, zoom is displaying over others.

> P8: I wonder settings and turn it off.

Tyler: Maybe if you click on that.

> P8: Okay. I shall shut it off.

Tyler: Hmm! Oh, actually, we want to keep that.

> P8: Okay.

Tyler: Sorry about that.

> P8: That's fine!

Tyler: I'm just trying to think about where we are right now.

> P8: Let me let me hit my! Oh, perfect!

Tyler: Yes, that's what we need. Okay, awesome. And let's get back to.

> P8: So I'm.

Tyler: The one to the left.

Tyler: Yes.

> P8: With you on it. Okay? So I'm gonna close the other ones.

Tyler: Perfect.

> P8: Sorry. You know I'm using my other stuff there. Okay.

Tyler: That's okay. That's perfect. Okay? Yes. Okay, let's go ahead and click the next link. So you're gonna need to scroll down.

Tyler: and then it'll be yeah, that one perfect.

Tyler: Okay? So this one's gonna look very similar to begin with. And so let's go ahead and just click in that question. Box perfect. And we have the same question. It's about mobility or assistive devices. You can click, continue when you're ready.

> P8: Oh, you've been listening!

Tyler: Tell me more about your reaction.

> P8: I feel confident that it is actually helping me define my question to get the help I need.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: And what made you feel confident? Can you tell me what you saw that made you feel that way?

> P8: The option for me to filter the information. I'm getting.

> P8: You know. It makes me feel like I'm gonna get all those places. I don't want to go off my table.

Tyler: Yeah, okay, so you like that, you can have a way of filtering. And you notice that because of that thing that says, select category.

> P8: Correct.

Tyler: And what about below where it says helpful resources? What's this.

> P8: Oh, let's see.

> P8: based on clashed.

> P8: I think it would be nice if the applicable items appeared at the top of the list. Rather than are you eligible for health, benefits or disability benefits? Because.

> P8: I'm thinking that if I'm here I already know I am [eligible]. Automobile, that, the relatable items to the question [should be] first. I can still see giving somebody the option to inquire into disability benefits, and so forth. But just trying to relate to the question being offered, it seems like the most viable areas of information should be at top of the list rather than the whole.

Tyler: Yeah, I can see that.

> P8: The whole fishing expedition. Yeah.

Tyler: Yeah. So you want the most specific or the thing that you think is the most related to your.

> P8: By the most relatable, relatable, or most applicable items. First, st yeah.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. If you clicked on one of these items we won't actually click on one today. But what do you think would happen.

> P8: Knowing how to be a website works to probably take you to a general page about

> P8: if you want automotive adapted equipments, here are the veterans, benefits, rules, and blah blah, and you get a 1 time blah blah for a car and blah blah. and no further information.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: so how would that make you feel? If this is like the va you're asking a question, the va is giving you this link that you can click on? Do you think you would choose to click on it.

> P8: Yeah, I'd see what's there.

Tyler: Okay.

> P8: Helpful, trying to be a hopeful person, you know.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: what if it didn't answer your question? What if you clicked on automobile adaptive equipment? And you were like, I still have that question, what would you do?

> P8: Couple of different avenues of thought. One would be, yeah typical thing. I'm I'm not getting any information here, and I may go back to the Internet and search for other avenues.

> P8: It would be nice if it would give you the opportunity to get in touch with someone that could actually. Give you further information.

Tyler: Yeah, okay, that makes sense.

Tyler: Do you think anything that we're looking at so far has been automated.

> P8: Yes.

Tyler: What do you think's been automated so far?

> P8: I think the question has been filtered by automation to take you to excuse me. The typical information mail of web links.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: So it used the question to figure out which links to give you. And that part was automated right.

> P8: Yeah.

Tyler: Okay, yeah, that makes sense.

### Concept A

Tyler: Okay, [P8], let's shift to the last prototype. So we need to get back to zoom. Yeah, perfect. And then I'm gonna send one more link it's I just sent it. So you'll have to scroll down now.

Tyler: Perfect, and we'll just click on that last one.

Tyler: And we're gonna do the same thing. It's gonna look very familiar from the start. So you can guide me through this.

Tyler: And our question is the same.

Tyler: And now tell me about this page.

> P8: I thoroughly disgusted, and want to just close the app and go back to what I was doing.

Tyler: Yeah, so it seems like, you have the most negative reaction to this version.

> P8: Because, like I, the whole thing, I started up front, you know, every time you look for some specific help they automatically think, oh, you want compensation.

Tyler: Yeah, yeah. What if this said.

Tyler: what if it's a life insurance? How would you react.

> P8: I don't know.

> P8: Oh, they're trying to sell me now.

Tyler: Okay.

> P8: Wait. Wait. You already have it. So I you know, I'm like, Okay, I'm not interested in that, because I already have it.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P8: With the Va. Like it for servicemen disabled

> P8: single service means group life insurance, anyways.

> P8: But I would think it was totally non applicable to what I was asking, as do I think this is not applicable to what I was asking.

Tyler: Okay, got it.

Tyler: So you're you'd be just as frustrated essentially. If it said kind of any wrong option here.

> P8: Yeah, yeah, we yeah, we like answers. not the hand holding. But oh, do you need this? Or do we want to sell you this? Or do we want to get you open this? Oh, do we want to create frustration in your life?

Tyler: Yeah. What if this page Said healthcare.

> P8: Oh, it depends what it meant, you know in my person that discerns the term healthcare into all. They want me to talk to somebody, or they want me to go see another mental health, professional or or are they helping me drill down.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P8: There's not a confidence building thing in that statement.

Tyler: Yeah, I I love the way you phrase that it feels like, even if the suggestion is correct. It's not like really getting you giving you anything. It's just sort of like saying, Oh, your questions about healthcare.

> P8: And the more you push buttons, and it's in your honor you around in the Hamster mill and not getting you in a positive direction, the more frustrated you get with it.  Because most of these people have already experienced a great level of frustration.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P8: And they have a great level of humility in just asking for help. To begin with.

Tyler: Yeah, yeah, totally.

### Cool down

Tyler: Let's let's go ahead and stop sharing your screen, and we'll just spend the last

Tyler: couple of minutes talking? So yeah, if you come back to me here and then at the bottom

Tyler: you can click, stop sharing. So yeah, perfect

Tyler: awesome. So you can see me now.

> P8: Yep.

Tyler: Okay, cool.

Tyler: So that was really helpful. We looked at 3 different things. And it's kind of like 3 different ways of doing something similar.

Tyler: It felt pretty obvious to me which one stood out as the one you liked the most, and the one that you disliked the most, so I think the one we just looked at you seem to dislike the most, or find the most frustrating, and then that one in the middle that provided some

Tyler: detailed links. Seemed like it was getting you closer to the direction you wanted to go.

> P8: Exactly, even if it still offered.

> P8: The tangent had gentle direction, that I don't want to go in.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P8: Able to choose what I wanted. So.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: yeah, it's really interesting to watch. Because in all 3 scenarios, we sort of we want to show you what happens when it doesn't get it right. So we don't want to show you the happy path, like everything worked perfectly. Do you like this? Because usually people like when things work perfectly so for all 3 scenarios. We're not showing you a perfect option, right? But you seemed like slightly less frustrated by the less perfect option. When you had that filtering ability.

Tyler: Tell me why that is why is filtering so important here?

> P8: I think it's because it gives me the chance. Excuse me

> P8: the opportunity to feel like I'm deleting

> P8: the areas. I don't want to go to.

> P8: And that I'm focusing on the intent of my question by being able to select particular topics.

> P8: And maybe if there was a topic in there that I was curious about, or I hadn't thought about in the phrasing of my question. I could include that as well.

> P8: Hmm, okay, so it might.

> P8: So maybe I was. You know. Chances are if you're not already in the healthcare system, and you're not on some

> P8: level of compensation for your disabilities. I don't think you're going to be@va.gov, anyway.

> P8: So I don't think you wanna placate them.

> P8: What's that crap they've already been through? I mean, some of these guys have been in the disability conversation process for 1520 years, been denied horrible. told so many crap stories by other people, and seen a lot of useless shuffling in the system that you want a direct answer, want something applicable.

Tyler: Yeah. Totally.

> P8: But we do all find things that we didn't know were there, like, maybe, Vrne. It doesn't define what that is unless you already know it but gives them a chance, for now.

Tyler: Yeah, yeah. Part of me wonders to that point, in the example that you liked the best. Some of those links had more descriptions right like it, said CPAP supplies, or and it told you a little bit about what was involved. But we looked at other lists where that wasn't the case there wasn't a description of what was involved. So if it said healthcare, for example, your question to me was what part of healthcare.

> P8: Right.

Tyler: Do you think that part of the reason you liked that? One example is because there was more description.

> P8: Description is very important. That takes assumption out of your mind. It takes the possibility of clicking on something and getting frustrated because you took. When you want to take a right turn.

> P8: I liked it also, because, like, I say, maybe there was an avenue I hadn't thought of could include that. I you know, since I'm not talking to somebody as you and I are talking about a subject, we're constantly

> P8: thinking about it and evolving it into the most direct thing.

> P8: And sometimes you get information you're consciously thinking of. And so oh, that's important. And it helps you define further what goal you want to come out of that one. Or maybe create a new one.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: definitely. So it's giving you some ideas like as you're asking your question. If it says, Oh, and there's CPAP supplies, you might think. Oh, well, actually, that might be useful for me as well, or whatever it might be.

> P8: Need them as well, I mean, I have a CPAP, hearing aids need batteries... and so forth. So oh, yeah, come to think about. I only got 2 packs of batteries left. That's.

> P8: but it would be nice if you go down that rabbit hole. If you could come back to get back to your original question, as well.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: Yeah, there's a lot of potential rabbit holes in some of these tools that we're showing, you and I'm curious how much you would be willing to go down a rabbit hole, or if you would actually just prefer to send your question to somebody else, and wait for them to reply.

> P8: I'd rather go down the rabbit hole, climb back out and have to worry about for me. And are they gonna call me on the home phone? Are they gonna call me on the cell phone? Am I gonna have my assistant listening technology nearby, or you know?

> P8: And there's more things. But.

Tyler: yeah, that makes sense. I can see how the goal is to get an answer to your question, not necessarily to submit your question to the Va. For them to like. Write a reply back to you.

> P8: There again, who's getting the question?

> P8: No, yeah.

> P8: Is it? Is it somebody with specialized knowledge? Is it the new hire of the day. That's just been told. Okay, here you sit on this phone and you answer these questions, kind of thing. So yeah.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: I think I have one last question before we're up. I know we're at the hour almost at 1 point we had a little bit of text, and it said, We're giving you this suggestion, based on other similar questions that veterans have asked in the past. Do you remember when it said that.

> P8: Briefly. Yeah.

Tyler: Briefly, yeah, what does that mean to you when they say we're suggesting this, based on what other veterans have asked in the past.

> P8: Mean I'm getting lumped in a pool. But you know, if it was accurate. That might be a potential filter source. But I can see where some people would feel like you're making an assumption.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: Yeah, I can see that I can see how if the assumption is wrong, and you feel like you've been like lumped into this group. How that could feel a little bit frustrating.

> P8: Yeah.

Tyler: Okay. Awesome. We are at the hour. Do you have any questions for me?

> P8: No, I don't think so.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: well, thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate it. I learned a lot from talking with you. And I think this will help us figure out a better way of doing some of the things we've been trying to do and making this process a little bit simpler for veterans, so I hope you take part in research in the future. If you have any questions, Shannon should reach out to you after we finish, and you can ask her any questions if you might have any, and otherwise that's all from me.

> P8: Excellent. Well, thank you, I appreciate it. Tyler.

Tyler: Thank you.

> P8: It was a positive experience, you know. It's being the 1st time I would definitely think about doing it again.

Tyler: Oh, good.

Tyler: Okay, awesome. Yeah. It's super helpful for us. So we do really appreciate it. And hopefully, we'll see you again.

> P8: Okay.

Tyler: Thanks, [P8], bye.
