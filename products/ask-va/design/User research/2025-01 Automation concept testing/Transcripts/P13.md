Tyler: Alright. So the recording started, I just wanna confirm you're comfortable. If I record my screen and audio today.

> P13: Yes, I'm comfortable.

Tyler: Thank you alright. Do you have any questions for me at this point?

> P13: No, I don't.

Tyler: Okay, let's go ahead and get started. Before we look at these prototypes. I just want to learn a little bit about you and your experience with the Va.

> P13: No.

Tyler: How long have you been a veteran.

> P13: I joined in 2009.

Tyler: Okay, Gotcha, you joined the service, or you became a veteran.

> P13: Yes.

Tyler: Okay.

> P13: 2009.

Tyler: Okay, Gotcha. And then these days, how do you interact with the Va.

> P13: I either go in person or I do telephone, or I do video appointments. I also make sure to message my primary via the what's the app? The Va mobile app. I have it installed on my phone. Or I'll use the regular website. I think they just transition over to. It's not I get it mixed up. It was Ebenefits then it was

> P13: va.gov or something. Then my DS login, and then my id login, so I get a little jumbled up. But I've I'm hanging in there.

Tyler: Well, that's good. It's understandable. There's a lot of changes and a lot of different.

> P13: Yeah.

Tyler: Apps and log ins and things, and all.

Tyler: Sorts of stuff.

Tyler: How do you find the experience of contacting your doctor using that messaging tool.

> P13: I don't have an issue. It is a little overwhelming because I have went through different vas before. So all of those locations populate on my drop down, menu, so I have to. I don't. I'm not always sure if I'm contacting my doctor or not, so what I'll do is I'll address the message to the doctor and say, this message is for XY. And Z. Since I can't explicitly see their name on the drop.

> P13: You, I can just see the location. So, for example, on my screen, it'll show like, Va. [location] VA [location]. So I've been to several of those. So I'm like, I'm like, okay, let me get the right address because I'm in [state] now. So those names are still populated on my drop down, menu, even when you transfer vas, if that makes sense

> P13: makes sense. Yeah, yeah.

Tyler: Yeah, I can see how that's confusing. And your workaround is like to address the person and hope it gets to the right.

> P13: Person.

Tyler: That that makes sense.

> P13: Yes.

Tyler: I'm do you know, if you ever contacted the VA. Using something called, Ask Va.

> P13: I have tried to use. I think that's where you can. Is it where you can chat, or something, or leave like a message for somebody like I've waited in the queue, and nobody ever came. I have attempted to like do like a live chat experience. I think that's what it was called where I sent a message, and this they said, someone will respond, but it never worked so gave up on it. Yeah.

Tyler: Okay. Gotcha, yeah, that sounds frustrating.

Tyler: Yeah, there's a couple of different tools that the Va. Uses. One of them is like a chat bot, for example. And with that one you're talking to a robot, and but it's like a chat.

> P13: Yes.

Tyler: And it sounds like, maybe you could have been using something else that I am not aware of. There's also a tool called ask Va, which is a contact form, so you can fill up of form, and then it gets sent to the Va. And then they get back to you.

> P13: Oh, in that case, no, I haven't used that.

Tyler: Use that one. Okay, okay, cool. We're going to talk more about ask Va today. But I think your experiences of using other Va tools will be helpful in our conversation before we move on. I want to just take a step back. And we think about like these experiences of contacting the Va. In the past or in the future. What's the most important thing to you when it comes to having a good experience contacting the Va.

> P13: Making sure that it's straightforward. Making sure that I feel secure with sending those mess messages. Because I am sending sensitive questions and photos. I'm attaching photos sometimes. Sometimes I've had like a rash. And I'm like, I need to send this up to dermatology or my primary care. And I want to make sure that I'm safe with sending those screenshots through that portal.

Tyler: Yeah, that's great. So making sure that it's secure is is really important yeah.

> P13: Yes. Okay.

Tyler: Yeah, I can see why.

Tyler: I'm going to ask you a couple of different questions. Now, one thing we're going to talk about today is automation.

Tyler: And when I'm talking about automation, I'm thinking about when a computer is doing something that usually a human would do right.

Tyler: So it could be like having a computer help summarize an article for you, or give you a recommendation right?

Tyler: Do you know, if you use any tools that do something like this, or include some type of automation.

> P13: So currently, I'm a user of chat GPT, plus, I make Youtube videos. So I get help with my content. I've used Grammarly and still use Grammarly from time to time as a graduate student pursuing my master's. And so those are some of the automated tools that I have used. I've used copilot. I've used Google Sge. I've experimented with Google. I think it's called Gemini, not a fan, but yes.

Tyler: Okay, awesome. It sounds like you have a lot of experience. Which is really useful and interesting for me.

Tyler: when you think about your experiences with the Va. This could be across many different ways you have engaged with the Va. Does anything come to mind in terms of ways that automation similar to these tools you use elsewhere could help

Tyler: with your interactions with the Va. Does anything come to mind.

> P13: The scheduling section. Depending on what Va you are at, you may, be able to schedule your appointments explicitly through the website, whereas in the area that I'm in, I have to wait for a phone call, or I would love to do an automatic version over the phone where I don't have to wait for a certain department to open

> P13: because they don't have access to that scheduling. I guess platform if you will. So I would love to see automation for those types of instances.

Tyler: Yeah, that that makes a lot of sense. It's a really helpful example. So in terms of like scheduling appointments, you've pointed out a couple of different ways, that you might be able to use some sort of automation or AI to make that that easier for you, or you could do it at different times of day, or whatever that's.

> P13: Yes.

Tyler: Helpful.

Tyler: Awesome. Well, we're gonna talk a lot more about that as we go along. But let's get set up with one of these prototypes to start. So have you shared your screen on Zoom from your phone before.

> P13: Yes.

Tyler: Okay. If you can go ahead and share your screen with me.

Tyler: you can do that whenever you're ready.

> P13: Okay, we should see, okay.

Tyler: Perfect, awesome thanks. So I'm gonna send a link in the chat on Zoom, so it'll show up on your side if you can open that up for me. This is gonna be the 1st prototype that we look at together.

> P13: Okay.

Tyler: So I think it's loading. Yeah, perfect, awesome. And then you can just X out of that awesome. Okay?

Tyler: Alright. So let me tell you a little bit about this and so we're again. We're looking at a prototype. Not everything on here is gonna be like something you can click on. I'm gonna help guide you through that

Tyler: Excellent!

Tyler: But we're going to pretend like we're on va.gov, and we're using this tool called, ask Va.

Tyler: I mentioned this before. Ask Va is a form, and you can use this form to ask the Va. Any question, so it could be about education or disability, compensation, or whatever it might be.

Tyler: Okay? And so we're gonna look at 3 different versions of Ask Va, and all of 3 versions. We're going to be asking the Va, the same question. And there's going to be some similarities and some differences between these 3 versions. And that's what we're going to talk about.

> P13: Okay.

Tyler: Awesome.

### Concept B

Tyler: Alright. So on this 1st one feel free to scroll around and tell me what you would do on this page.

> P13: okay, so with this particular section, I would go ahead and just type in my question, now, it's not looking how I assumed it was. Gonna look, honestly, I thought I was gonna have to answer like who I am. Enter my name. My, but I'm not sure if that's a part of the flow. So I'm a little weary. I'm like, well, what department is this going to like? It looks like I just hopped into a general inquiry section. And so I'm like, I know the Va. Is broken down, usually into different departments, so I will be a little weary of using this, but it looks like I have to just type my question in 1st and then, which I would do and then click, continue. And then I'm hoping that as I see each screen, I'll be able to provide necessary information.

Tyler: Okay, that was really useful. So I can see why you have some hesitation. It honestly reminds me of what we talked about earlier, where you're contacting your doctor, and you want to make sure it's going to the right person. And then that's not that's not obvious right now with where we, where we're beginning. Here.

Tyler: Yeah, that's really helpful. And it also sounds like you're expecting you're gonna have to give some information about yourself. In order to send your this question. Yeah, cool.

> P13: Okay.

Tyler: That's helpful. Okay? So we can't actually type in this prototype today, we're just gonna pretend like we have typed. So if you just click in that question. Box? This is gonna be the question we're asking the Va, so

Tyler: what resources are available for veterans who need support with mobility or assistive devices.

> P13: Okay.

Tyler: Okay? And I can remind you of the question if you need me to. Okay.

Tyler: so show me what you would do next.

> P13: So I would click, continue.

> P13: okay, oh, so this is a flow like a, oh, so this is like a topic tight.

> P13: oh, boy. Why did I think I was talking to a I'm sorry, so.

Tyler: No.

> P13: Rearranging my expectation. Prior to that, I thought I was like, Oh, I'm just sending a question like an email.

Tyler: With.

> P13: Then I thought, Oh, the keyword was automation. So this is more like that flow where you're prompting, sending a prompt. And then you're getting an answer. Okay.

Tyler: Hmm, okay, no. But that's a that's a really useful distinction. So at 1st it felt more like you were, gonna send an email. And now it feels more like it's almost like a a tool, like a guide. And at the end you're gonna get an answer to your question.

> P13: Yes, and also yes, and I think the flow is kind of throwing me off. Because I'm so used to like chat, gpt flow and co-pilot Microsoft copilot, where I'm literally, it's like you're.

> P13: It's done in a way where it's more of a conversational flow. But because I'm going through in this manner. It didn't feel like I was

> P13: sending a prompt initially. If that makes sense, I would have recognized.

Tyler: Yes.

> P13: I think I would have recognized the flow a lot better, or what I was.

> P13: I would have tracked it better if it was more of an a conversational layout, if that makes sense.

Tyler: That does make sense. Yeah, you're picturing more like that chat conversation where you send something, and it sends something back. And then you send something or whatever.

Tyler: And that's different to this. Yeah, I can see how that shaped your expectation of what this might be. That makes sense. Let's look a little bit more at this page.

Tyler: And without clicking anything yet. Just tell me about what this page is telling you.

> P13: Okay? So it says, we think your question is about disability compensation, and relates to how to file a claim. But that's not the question. So that will be incorrect with what the prompt responded with. So it looks like, I would need to maybe edit this question because it says that this is correct, continue or try adding more information to your question. So the output was incorrect from the tool.

> P13: because this is talking about something completely different. This is just talking about, if you need, like, a mobility assistance, something like that and not a disability claim. So at this point I would go ahead and click edit, and then add additional facts to the question.

Tyler: Okay, awesome. So you put in your question and the and where, as you would say, like maybe the prompt. And then.

Tyler: It. It said, this is about disability, compensation, which seems wrong. And so you would edit the question.

> P13: Yes, of course.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. And if you were gonna edit the question, would you delete this question and write a new one? Would you rephrase your question. Would you add to it? What do you think you would do.

> P13: Click edit, and then I would add to it to clarify. I would probably respond that this is not about disability or compensation, or anything like that, I would say, this is not about disability, compensation. And then I would proceed with hoping that the tool now knows that they don't need to give me that kind of suggestion.

Tyler: Okay, Gotcha. So you would try and almost like converse with the tool. And say, No, actually, it's not about that, and hope that it recognizes. Oh, okay, if it's not about that, then I'll try a different option. Okay, gotcha.

Tyler: alright. So let's click on edit, and we'll just see what happens. And this is kind of what you were describing. Right? You now have the chance to talk to. Sorry, rewrite or add something.

Tyler: we can't type in this prototype. So let's just click in that box. We'll pretend like we've typed. And here, what this person chose to do or or yourself in this scenario is, make it more specific. So it says, I need automobile adaptive equipment.

> P13: Okay.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: So show me what would happen.

Tyler: what you would do next to continue.

> P13: I would click, update here and then.

> P13: Seeing the screen load.

> P13: Okay? And then we think this question is about healthcare related to prosthetics. Now, I'm not sure if prosthetics actually ties into needing automobile. But maybe it is. I'm not too familiar with this category.

> P13: so I guess at this point I would say, the key word to me is auto automotive. So I would be a little weary. Is that like the same thing? Because when I think of prosthetics, I think of someone, maybe with the prosthetic leg, prosthetic arm. I'm not. I don't know if prosthetics relates to automobile services for people that need them. It might but because I'm not educated on that, I would assume that I'd like no, let me select my category and topic. And then, honestly, at this point, I would have quit this tool if this were real life, because it's like in my mind, I would say, this is too buggy.

> P13: This is kind of I would use the word annoying, I'm like. And then another part of my brain goes. Well. Why didn't they let me select my category and topic

> P13: 1st in the tool. That way I could just enter my question, and they would find hypothetically the correct, prompt or feedback to give me initially kind of like what I talked about earlier, where I kind of entered that vague section of my question. But there was no clear clarification about my identity or my needs. There was no drop down menu to select. I feel like this could have been as we say, I'm from North Carolina nipped in the bud a.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P13: Yeah.

Tyler: Yeah, totally that that makes a lot of sense. So you would kind of lose a little bit of hope. And I also think it was interesting how you said, I think. Why didn't it just let me select my category and topic. In the 1st place.

> P13: Yes.

Tyler: So I think that is.

Tyler: that makes sense. Let's pause here on this page.

> P13: Okay.

Tyler: Was any part of this process? Would you describe any of this as automation, or being automated, or using AI.

> P13: Yes, certainly, when I saw the loaded section like the loading screen, and then they gave you the suggestions based on what other veterans asked, just like I'm seeing here the suggested topic. And then we think your question is about health care and related to prosthetics. And then another thing that I just forgot about where it says you should receive a reply within 7 business days. But initially, if this is AI,

> P13: now, I'm thinking, oh, there is no live person involved in this. They're asking me a lot of questions to give me a suggested topic to give me the answer explicitly from the Va. Website. So at this point, at what point do I need a live person to answer this question, if the tool is giving me suggestions, or maybe they're just trying to automate my question, to go to the right department to speak live agent. So that's kind of like what I'm kind of.

> P13: you know, kind of twiddling within my brain. If that makes sense.

Tyler: Okay, that's really helpful that I can kind of understand all the different things you're thinking about and why this might work like this.

Tyler: And also how AI might have been involved in the process.

Tyler: That's awesome. Okay, what we're gonna do now is we're gonna look at the second prototype. So I'm gonna share a link in the zoom chat. If you click, yeah, perfect.

### Concept A

Tyler: you can come back and find that second link.

> P13: Okay.

Tyler: and we'll let this load. And this is basically gonna be. It's gonna start off the same way. We're still asking the same question to the Va. But part of the process is, gonna is gonna differ now. So you can go ahead and walk me through. This beginning.

> P13: And then click continue.

> P13: Okay, good. I like this flow because now I get to the Category section, even though it looks like the category that was about mobility services. So at this point the suggestion is still off. So I do have the icon which I consider a luxury to be able to edit there, because sometimes when you're on different websites and platform, they don't always give you that option. So now I finally get to the dropdown menu here, where I would need to find the closest one. So this is talking about automated. So I'm just double checking to see if there's anything explicitly that mentions that.

Tyler: Okay.

> P13: But it looks like I would go for the option.

> P13: Let me see, I would go for healthcare

> P13: just based on the prompt and then I would click, save here.

> P13: and then I would click, continue

> P13: in that dropdown section initially. If I did not find my explicit category, I would be a little more inclined to say, Okay, can I add a section if it's not found just as a backup? Because I would be so worried that even that category that I select I still like is that specific enough? Or is that too, general?

> P13: Because I already have to wait, you know, 7 business days to hear back. So it's it's talking about prosthetics. I'm assuming I'm just gonna double check. But like I would double check this category. I'm like, Okay, this is the Va saying that this what this mobility services is, it falls under prosthetics. Then I would go ahead and just click continue. But I would double check just in case there's something more specific that I could

> P13: select just in case.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: that's really helpful. So you went through that pretty quickly and you you've immediately noticed like it's given me disability compensation, I'm going to correct that. You went and edited. You chose healthcare, and you continued, and now it's giving you this other suggestion for prosthetics.

> P13: Yes.

Tyler: Is it helpful that it's making suggestions to you.

> P13: Yes and no. On 1 point. It's like, okay, it keeps it. I think they're giving me the wrong suggestions. So that feels a little bit more laborious than it should be versus my, because I feel like, if I'm going to enter a question that I feel has keywords that are strong enough to be identified. I feel like the automation process will be a lot more simple and straightforward and less buggy, as I like to call it. It's like I shouldn't have to edit that much if I'm going to rely on this tool. 

> P13: Because I wouldn't be because I I have tried. For example, I have tried different AI products, and some of them just don't work as well. They kind of just fall flat. And so that's why I pay for Chat Gpt plus, because I feel like it's it's at the top

> P13: and you know, with what it does and the capabilities of it. But this right here is like well, I asked the tool initially about automative and mobility and assistance, and then it kind of gave me a poor answer in this scenario, so that would feel very frustrating.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: yeah, I get the sense that if it makes suggestions, and it's it does it pretty well, like it's pretty perfect. Then it's nice, but if it's not good job, it's very quickly frustrating right?

> P13: That's correct.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: I'm not actually sure you might be able to click on edit here if you wanted to see the list. It doesn't let you. Okay, cool. I think this must be the last page in this prototype. So we'll move on to the to the last one.

### Concept C

> P13: Okay.

Tyler: So we're gonna look at one more and let me just send this one in the chat.

> P13: Okay.

> P13: okay, so this one, I tapped that resources available to support mobility. Okay? And then click, continue.

> P13: And then they ask about my okay, based on your question. We think this information will be helpful. But you do. You are required to select a category, even though I already see the link here. So I feel like I would. I wish I could bypass this because they gave me helpful resources here, so I wouldn't really pay attention to this section.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P13: Go ahead and select it. Okay? So it would be health care.

> P13: And then I would finally have the ability to click on this like I would click on automated adaptive equipment, and then I would click, continue.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: yeah. So you won't be able to click on everything on this page. But that's helpful to know. That's what you'd wanna do so. Let's talk about this. What would happen after you clicked? Continue, if you clicked automobile adaptive, and then you click, continue. What are you expecting to see next.

> P13: So I would expect to see it says, Find out if I'm eligible to receive this. And so then at this point I would expect this entire page to talk about the eligibility of the automobile, adaptable equipment. The question did center around resources. So I'm trying to say, Okay, well, maybe that's also a part of the resources question as well at this point I don't know if I would need to continue on.

> P13: Well, that is a part of the resource. Okay, but I don't know if I would need to continue with receiving a reply from the within 7 business days. If I've already landed on the correct page and then been able to go through. Maybe my own eligibility. Maybe there's a list. Maybe there's a form, but anything I can go as a checklist. So at this point, that's what I would expect to happen. But I think you said what would happen if I click continue so? Yes, I would click on the link and then continue would take me to the eligibility section for the adaptive equipment. That's what I would expect.

Tyler: Okay, Gotcha, that's helpful. And so you're thinking that you mentioned like, you wouldn't even want to continue with this 7 business days sending the question thing, you would probably just go for find the information about automobile adaptive equipment yourself right.

> P13: Yes.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: that makes sense. Okay, and when you had to choose healthcare up at the top, why did you have to choose a category.

> P13: So I'm assuming that this is still in the flow of getting to the 7 business days or the completing the actual Inquiry, that I want to send should I not find the resources or I want to take advantage of still asking a question. It needs to go to the right department the correct person that will be able to answer the question correctly.

Tyler: Okay, Gotcha, that that makes sense. So you're choosing healthcare. If you wanted to continue down the route of sending your question to the Va.

> P13: Yes.

Tyler: Okay, gotcha.

Tyler: Okay, cool. Anything else you want to comment on this. Actually, I had one other question before that. It's giving you some links here so like automobile adaptive equipment. How did it decide to give you that link.

> P13: So I do expect that this section would be considered part of the AI or Automation process, where, based on my previous question, they were able to find resources related to that actual question.

Tyler: Okay. so they're looking at your question. And they're trying to find a resource that's most similar to that.

> P13: Yes. Yeah.

Tyler: Okay, perfect.

Tyler: Well, you are welcome to stop sharing your screen at this point, and then we'll just spend some time reflecting on what we just did.

### Cool down

Tyler: okay, there you are. Awesome. So we looked at 3 different ideas that are sort of similar, but sort of different. I'm curious if one of them stood out to you the most.

> P13: Definitely these, the 3rd one I felt like that was the the flow that I really enjoyed because the helpful resources section, although I feel like that's it was a little out of order to if that makes sense like, I wish the helpful resources would have been the second output after I click, continue, and not have to do the required category, especially since the helpful resources was spot on with my initial question.

> P13: Because in my mind, I'm like, I know, the Va. Can have overwhelming questions asked. So to utilize an automation system, to go ahead and kind of

> P13: get my own resources or the resources available and take advantage of the platform that way. I wouldn't have to kind of add additional questions to the to the pool, if you will. I feel like that way. I can be more self-sufficient as a veteran. So I definitely liked the 3rd one, for sure.

Tyler: Okay, Gotcha, that makes sense. And you're saying that it makes sense to have the helpful resources. Almost. First, st right? Because you want to go and try that route before you decide. If you need to keep asking the question.

Tyler: Correct. Okay, Gotcha. Yeah. That makes perfect sense to me.

Tyler: we also. So I'll kind of like, take a step back. We had these 3 ideas. They're all providing a suggestion to you. 2 of them. We're providing a suggestion for what your question is about. So.

> P13: Where's me?

Tyler: Saying, it's this category, right? And one of them, we're providing helpful links. And that's the one we talked about already. Just now those others where we're providing a suggestion for what your question is about.

Tyler: why is that, or is that not as useful.

> P13: Honestly because of the error. They literally said disability compensation. Now, if that had worked and it gave me the correct output, my answer would say, oh, it worked. The tool is has a high chance of getting my question. Answering my question efficiently, which I understand. Tools make mistakes. They're not perfect, just like Chat GPT. They make mistakes, too, but

> P13: because of how it was presented in that flow, I'm like, oh, they're probably gonna give me the wrong feedback if you will. So that's kind of what I thought.

Tyler: Okay, Gotcha. So it was like making, if it was making the correct assumption, then you could see it being useful, I'm curious, like, you seem pretty analytical. And like you're thinking through like quite a lot of steps ahead.

Tyler: If it had come back and it said, health care like we think your questions about health care. Do you think you would click, continue? Or would you be like well, is it health care? Or should I check that? It's not, you know, something more specific.

> P13: So if they found that category, I would like trust the tool, especially if it's my 1st time on the platform. I'm like, Okay, I don't have any like if I was a new veteran to the Va. System, and I didn't know anything about specific departments, and that happens even to this day. Now that I've been in the Va. For years. At this point, I still don't always know every category, every department. I still need to ask for help depending on the location that I'm going to. So it is helpful to kind of lean into a tool that is automated to help guide me to the right section, and the the good thing is that the backup

> P13: that I could still go through is still being able to finally get to the screen of I think sending a message to someone to get that answer within those 7 business days. Should I still be a little off with my the category? If that.

Tyler: Yeah. That does make sense. And you've used this term. You've described it in different ways. But you just said like this backup plan. So do you think it's fair to say that asking the question like sending it to the Va. And waiting those 7 business days is a backup plan to finding the answer yourself.

> P13: Yes, yes, to have like that, because there's nothing more frustrating than getting on a platform, and then thinking that you're going to be able to send an inquiry. And you kind of hit a wall. And there's nobody to contact sort of like when I've had issues with like a Google website. And it's like, or a Google product. And it's like, who do I contact, there's literally, no.

> P13: there's nobody to contact for Google. There's no email. It's like you hit a wall because everything is solely relied on that automation that they have, or those websites.

Tyler: Okay, Gotcha, so hitting a wall. And like having that no one to talk to if you if you can't find the answer to something is really frustrating.

> P13: Yes.

Tyler: And so, having that that kind of like backup avenue is useful, but it might not necessarily be your 1st the 1st thing you'd want to do.

> P13: Correct.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. We talked about how all of these prototypes included some type of automation where it was making some sort of like guess or suggestion based on information. Right? I'm curious. Are you familiar with the term data model?

> P13: I've heard it a little bit, but like when I use chat GPT, I think I see like data reset or something. But I don't know that goes over my head.

Tyler: Yeah, no worries me, too. Lol.

Tyler: So a data model is like a blueprint, and it helps define how data is collected and stored and then analyzed. And so if I told you that we were making a recommendation based on a data model, what would that mean to you.

> P13: So it seems like it kind of reminds me of the prototypes where it said, based on your question, this is what we think. I think it was a pool from other veterans. And that's why the output generated the way that it did, because that was the pool that the tool basically choose or pick from. It was like picking something from a hat. But the hat was the veterans questions that they generally ask. So I think. Of how that was. I kind of was able to understand that the data model.

Tyler: Yeah, that that's perfect. So you kind of made an association with something you saw that was talking about how we're making a suggestion based on other questions. Veterans have asked that are similar. Yeah, that that makes complete sense to me.

Tyler: I am curious, like at the beginning. When I asked you about automation. You had experience with a lot of different tools, and one of them we've talked about is Chat gpt plus I'm curious. Outside of using chat Gpt, what other positive experiences have you had with this kind of like technology? And in particular, is there an experience you've had where you've been asking a question. And it's went well.

> P13: I could think of my cell phone provider like being able to use the chat on Verizon and then asking about something as simple as what is my bill? What is the amount due? Sometimes it doesn't do well, like. I went to London, and I was using travel passes. And I was like, why am I getting these travel pass, even though I'm using a Esim and it just it failed.

> P13: Asking those questions. So I finally just spoke to a live agent. But in those instances of just being able to check when my bill is due, I feel like the less complex. The questions were, the tool did well, but like when it was a little bit more nuanced, or I guess. Complex. Then the Verizon chat experience kind of like, okay, no. Let's skip past that section and go straight to the live agent.

Tyler: Yeah, I can see that. So when it's more complex, it's usually not doing as good a job, and you sort of are learning like to expect that it might be good at simpler questions, and this might be testing your memory a little bit. But when you use something like that with the this like conversation, or however, you want to call it with Verizon?

Tyler: did you? Did you just like type in your question? And it was like, Oh, is this about this? Or do you remember the kind of the start of that process.

> P13: So yes. I logged into my Verizon app then I head, over to that little symbol in the, I think it's in the lower left side. I click on that. I think they asked, what do you need help with today? So I just type it in. Or sometimes, if I'm feeling lazy. I'll use my audio. I'll type with my voice and like, can you help me with this? And then I'll just hit enter but for the most part I just typed out the question on my keypad.

Tyler: Okay, gotcha cool? Alright. Well, I think you've answered all my questions, we finished a little bit early, mostly because you were just super speedy and and very articulate. So I appreciate you spending the time with me? Do you have any questions for myself or the team?

> P13: No, not at this time. I just want to say thank you all for what you do to help the Va. Run efficiently. Every department matters every feature. We really appreciate it. So thank you all so much.

Tyler: Oh, well, thanks for saying that. And same to you, this is like really helpful for our team. It helps us make better decisions. It helps us like realize when we're making. You know, we're going the wrong route, and we need to change things. So you've shared with us a lot of information that we will find very helpful, and I hope you keep taking part in research with the VA in the future.

> P13: We are.

Tyler: And yeah, that's all. Shannon, from the she's the one who sent up the research session. She's gonna reach out to you afterwards. If you have any questions to follow up, you can let her know, but otherwise we're all set. I hope you have a good

Tyler: rest of your Tuesday.

> P13: Okay, you guys, too. Bye, bye.

Tyler: Bye.
