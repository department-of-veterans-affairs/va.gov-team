Tyler: Alright. So I just want to confirm you're comfortable. If I record my screen and audio today.

> P12: I am okay with it.

Tyler: Okay, awesome. So that was a lot of information. Do you have any questions for me? At this point.

> P12: I, I would like to know, is it possible to get a copy of your recording at the end? If that's possible? If it's not. It's okay. But I would love it again. Like I said, I'm an advocate. So I think that utilizing what we learned, I've been able to spread it across platforms. That's good.

Tyler: Yeah, that's a really great question. And I actually don't know the answer. But I will find out. And I'll make sure that we follow up with you. Whether or not we're able to share it.

> P12: Okay. But yes, I'm ready to go.

Tyler: Okay, awesome. So before we start looking at some prototypes, I just want to get to know you and your experiences with the VA a little bit. How long have you been a veteran.

> P12: I'm 20 years retired Air Force, and I've been retired about 22 years.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: awesome. And you mentioned earlier when you 1st joined the call that you are an advocate, and you also interact with the Va like a couple of times a week. Is that right?

> P12: That's correct. I have multi faceted different ailments that have gone on with me since retirement. and so that and I see my doctors virtually. So I'm and that virtual program.

> P12: So when I have issues with the Va. And stuff of that nature, I challenge it back through them, so I'm I use the portal all the time.

Tyler: Okay, so you talk to your doctor, using my healthy vets, messaging system.

> P12: That's correct.

Tyler: Okay. And then you sometimes have telehealth appointments on there as well. So you can talk to your doctors. Okay.

Tyler: awesome. Are there other ways you contact the Va. Or you engage with the Va. That aren't related to your health care.

> P12: Well, again as an advocate, and when I say advocate for myself and for other veterans, I only I run a small nonprofit called [they're organization], and a great deal of my people that I engage with in primarily underserved community communities are other veterans. So when they have issues or whatnot, we sit down and we can collaborate, and we share our resources to who we need to be getting in contact with so.

> P12: We do that just on our own in that sense. So I do call into the [location] va quite a bit. I was still trying to utilize. I use utilize the what do you call it? Community health systems versus when the Va. Can't get me on appointment within 30 days.

> P12: I've used that system quite a bit as well. I probably get more. I probably engaged with the medical health system and in the community more so than the Va. Over the last 4 or 5 years.

Tyler: Okay, Gotcha, and how has your experience been with secure messaging? So when you're messaging your doctor online.

> P12: Secure messaging has been great. One of the concerns I do have, though, is when I talk to my doctor, say, for an appointment. The appointments may come up on my healthy vet. but if I call in to the [location] VA, those same appointments are not necessarily in their appointment system.

Tyler: Hmm.

> P12: So if I use my health event, it, it brings up all of my appointments. But if I call into the VA via the phone, they're not necessarily matching up.

Tyler: Oh, okay, yeah, that sounds a bit confusing and frustrating.

Tyler: What about other ways of contacting the Va online? Have you ever heard of? Ask Va.

> P12: I have, and I've used them especially I just became a hundred percent disabled over the last few or last year. So I use them a lot of times when I was trying to find out how to make adjustments to my claims and stuff of that nature, or or I've I've used them as well when

> P12: well, I was my one of my doctors prescribed me some just some basic shoes. It took me 3 years to actually get the prosthetics department and the rest of the Va. In line to make that happen. Frustrating.

Tyler: Yes.

> P12: All those tools that you're that that are out there by going online and and whomever and at some point, they they ultimately got it together, even having to file a Congressional in that.

Tyler: Okay. Oh, goodness.

> P12: [I've probably used everything] that there is out there.

Tyler: Okay, gotcha.

Tyler: Yeah. That sounds like a very frustratingly long time to wait. Well, we are going to talk a little bit more about ask Va. Today.

Tyler: But before we do that, if you kind of take a step back and think about your experiences contacting the Va. What is the most important thing to have a good experience for you.

> P12: I think, to follow up, and one of the one of the issues that I've had, and and I think over talking to different people. They're changing it somewhat.

> P12: They will tell you when that you have an appointment, or they'll send you a letter, or they'll say they sent you a letter. or someone would say they tried to make contact with you via phone or whatnot. And again.

> P12: as a veteran and myself, I have no need to lie, whether that happened or not. And so when I call back in to say, or if I'm trying to tell someone no, I didn't get a letter, or you know, in the mail system. Surely it takes a long time.

> P12: To it, appear in there even more so sometimes.

> P12: That was a 30 to 45 days, so I may miss an appointment, and they have canceled some of my appointments, because they say I didn't respond.

Tyler: Okay.

> P12: That there has to be the follow up. If they're sending out a mailer, they need to be following up via phone as well.

Tyler: Yeah, okay.

Tyler: So you need the contact to one, for there to be a follow up. And also the channel is important. So if you miss the mail they should. You also want to receive something over the phone, for example.

> P12: That's correct.

Tyler: That makes sense

Tyler: awesome. That's helpful background for me. And we'll continue to talk about this. But I do want to ask you some different questions. Now, one of the things we're going to talk about today is automation. And when I say automation, I'm thinking about when a computer does something that a person normally, manually has to do. So it could be. For example, you're asking your computer to help you summarize an article, or you're asking it for a recommendation.

Tyler: So there's different ways. Automation can be present in different tools. I'm curious if you know, or you can think of a time when you've used a tool that had some type of automation like this.

> P12: Well again with the population of your names and stuff on when you continue to go back to a site. But the Va. Or just any portal in that sense, I think, is it's good.

> P12: Especially when they're asking the same questions over and over again.

Tyler: Okay.

> P12: I've been able to maneuver it, but I know it frustrates a lot of veterans when they say you continue to ask me the same thing over and again. So so when I see that they have it already populated for the veteran or myself, it is good to see that where our automation is working.

Tyler: Yeah, that's a really great example. So it's helpful when the Va. Already knows something about you. If they can fill in that information for you to save you time having to do that over and over.

> P12: Yes.

Tyler: That makes sense.

Tyler: I have another question. When I bring up the idea of like, let's just, I'm just making this up. I'm not saying this is true. Let's say the Va was gonna start bringing in a lot more automation for Va's online tools.

Tyler: Do you have any hesitations or concerns. When I say that.

> P12: No, because I like, I said. I think it's especially for the senior population.

> P12: They would rather have. I know for myself again, and those that I talk to, that if they already the automation will help, because they get frustrated with having to answer the same questions, especially on stuff like their medicines over again, especially if they're on a lot of medicines.

> P12: All that stuff is already made readily available. It cuts down some of the frustration.

Tyler: Okay, so yeah.

> P12: So when somebody says we're gonna add automation, I just think they need to explain what automation is to the more senior population. So they're not afraid of it. Because, you know, we have these, all these other people talking about how somebody's being scammed and stuff of that nature. They need to be able to understand what automation means.

Tyler: Yeah. Great. Yeah, that's a great point that makes sense.

Tyler: awesome. Okay, let's go ahead and move forward. And we're gonna shift gears a little bit. I'm gonna share with you some prototypes. And the 1st thing that I'd like to do is have you share your screen on your phone. Do you know if you've done that before.

Tyler: if you've shared your screen on Zoom.

> P12: I have not. I've had people the people around me to do it. I I haven't actually did it. So what I.

Tyler: Yeah, no worries.

Tyler: That's totally fine. I'll help guide you through it. So you're currently looking at my face right? You could see me.

Tyler: Okay, awesome. So if you click in the middle of your screen, you're gonna see some things show up at the bottom. Some controls.

Tyler: Let me know if that happens. You see some things okay, and they're gonna disappear. So you might have to keep clicking just to wake your phone up. But one of those items is, gonna say, share, and it's gonna have an arrow.

Tyler: Usually it's green.

> P12: See it. It's not green on mine. It's a black and white screen share. I have shares probably all the way to the right. It says, share.

Tyler: Okay, perfect. So let's go ahead and click share.

Tyler: And then we're going to choose screen. It's going to give you some options. And we want to share screen.

Tyler: Tell me what you're seeing now.

> P12: Right now. My, my phone went to a totally different now. It came back. It just came back

> P12: So I'm gonna click on the share. As you said, okay, it says, so it has screen photos, icloud drive website. URL.

Tyler: Okay, so let's choose, screen that 1st one.

> P12: Okay.

Tyler: And then once you choose that you're gonna have to click, start broadcast.

> P12: Okay.

Tyler: And then I'm gonna let you know when I can start seeing your screen perfect.

Tyler: All right. So now I can see your screen there. I'm also getting an echo.

Tyler: Hmm.

> P12: I'm on. Speaker. Let me let me take you off, speaker, and.

Tyler: Okay.

> P12: See if we can hear you. Still. Okay.

Tyler: Okay. Can you still hear me?

> P12: Speak if you will.

> P12: I, so I can't hear you're speaking.

Tyler: Can you hear me? Hear me now?

> P12: Yeah, vaguely, but I can still hear you.

> P12: So.

Tyler: Okay. So let's think. So can you hear me now as normal?

> P12: I can hear you.

Tyler: Okay.

> P12: Okay.

Tyler: Hmm! Now I can hear the echo.

Tyler: I'm trying to think of how this has happened.

Tyler: Did you change anything on the sound? You said. Maybe you put me on Speaker.

> P12: Right. So I came back. So are you still getting the echo.

Tyler: I'm not getting the echo now.

> P12: Okay. So I can still hear you. And we're so we're okay. We're back.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: Okay, awesome. All right. So we need to share your screen again. And if that's the reason it's causing a problem. I have a backup plan.

> P12: And I see if we can get back to that.

> P12: Okay.

> P12: it's not allow me to come back to share it on my screen, for whatever reason.

Tyler: Okay, tell me what you're seeing.

> P12: So I see you again. So I know I gotta click on you in the middle of the

> P12: we're gonna do that everything and go.

> P12: The where are you doing.

Tyler: Can you hear me?

> P12: And ...

Tyler: Can you hear me now?

Tyler: Are you able to hear me?

Tyler: Hmm!

> P12: Can you hear me? Cause I.

Tyler: I can hear you. Can you hear me?

> P12: I can't hear you again. Now.

Tyler: You can't hear me.

Tyler: Okay.

> P12: I can't hear you, but I can see I can hear you now.

Tyler: You can hear me. Okay, I think there's a delay.

> P12: Can you hear me?

Tyler: I can hear you.

> P12: Now, whatever reason.

Tyler: I'm yeah. I'm talking now. Can you hear me now?

> P12: I I can't hear you.

Tyler: You can hear me now.

> P12: So I just clicked on start broadcast.

Tyler: Okay, I think we got a little bit, the Internet was really laggy, and I couldn't hear you properly. But can you confirm you're hearing me. Okay, right now.

Tyler: I don't think so.

Tyler: And.

> P12: Hello!

Tyler: Hi.

> P12: And boom, boom.

> P12: yeah, I

> P12: I don't.

Tyler: Can you hear me?

> P12: I can hear you now.

Tyler: Okay.

> P12: Yeah.

Tyler: I think the Internet is really slow right now.

> P12: I can hear you right now.

Tyler: Okay.

> P12: I can't.

Tyler: Okay.

[P12 drops from the call.]

[P12 rejoins the call.]

Tyler: Hi, there.

> P12: Hi.

Tyler: Can you hear me? Okay.

> P12: I can.

Tyler: Yay, okay.

Tyler: Sorry about that. I think it got really like Laggy, and I couldn't really hear you.

Tyler: So hopefully, this is much better.

> P12: It is.

Tyler: Okay? And you're still on your phone screen, right for Zoom.

> P12: It came up, telling me to exit, but I did not. I always wait until I got back with you, so let me let me pull that did it did see. Let me see, did it disconnect? Or where are we now? So.

Tyler: Oh, yeah, yeah, don't worry, cause I think you'll only be able to be on one zoom call at a time. So.

> P12: Oh, okay. Okay.

Tyler: So you should be okay. I just want to check. You can see my face right now. Right? You're seeing the video.

> P12: No, that. That's what I'm saying. I have you on the phone because I I don't know what happened here with Zoom. I don't even see it anymore.

Tyler: Oh, I see. Okay.

Tyler: So you're only connected through audio. Now.

> P12: Yes.

Tyler: Okay, one second, if you don't mind.

Tyler: I'm just asking Shannon the one that you were just on the phone with. Because I'm not actually entirely sure how you should connect now that you've called in. So she's just gonna get back to me in a minute.

> P12: So my, my phone again is now polling, or whatever it's called. It's sharing that it's loading.

> P12: Zoom again, but it still has not connected back to you. I can't see you. It's still just.

Tyler: Oh, okay.

Tyler: Okay, interesting. I wonder why? Maybe Zoom is having a little moment.

> P12: That's possible.

Tyler: I'm gonna see if Shannon has any other ideas otherwise. We can. We can pivot.

> P12: Okay.

Tyler: She's just getting back to me.

> P12: And okay. The screen just came back up. But you're not. The screen just came back up. But so I see all of the chat with 4 people in the chat and stuff. But no picture of you. You're not. You're not up.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: But you can see the chat. Let me just try and test this. I'm just gonna say, this is Tyler.

Tyler: You can see the chat show up.

> P12: Meeting chat. So

> P12: the only thing. So I didn't. I did not get that message. Only thing. It shows me that there's a chat, and it has a chat with 4 people in it, or and it shows me that we have 5 participants.

Tyler: Hmm.

> P12: Total, but it's not showing. It's not showing your chat that you're.

Tyler: That I just did.

> P12: It didn't, didn't come through.

Tyler: Okay, interesting.

Tyler: I'm wondering if you can. Keep the audio the way you're talking to me right now and then.

> P12: And it.

Tyler: Shannon sent you a link via email right to join this call.

> P12: I mean back when I when you set up yeah, yeah.

Tyler: So maybe, can you navigate back to your email on your phone? And then we're gonna try and re click on that link.

> P12: So do you want me to close out where the zoom that I'm in now?

Tyler: I'd like you to stay on the call with me. So I think.

> P12: No, no, I mean no, I mean so. So I'm talking to you now through the phone.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P12: Looking at. So I'm looking at the zoom screen like I said, I can see now that that we're still in the zoom screen.

> P12: But I don't see you and like I said I saw all the other stuff. I saw that. How many is in the chat. I did not get your chat.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: I think probably you can close that out if, for whatever reason we get disconnected, I'll have Shannon call you back. But let's try and close that out. And hopefully, we still stay together on the phone.

> P12: Alright. Okay.

> P12: So it says. and actually does not allow me to close it out right now. It's saying it's trying to connect again.

Tyler: Right.

> P12: Push, push back. So I see 2 images of folks, but not no one's in the image

> P12: on my phone.

> P12: See if I can do something. But let me see if I can try to get something else to get out of this.

> P12: We don't want to lose you on the phone.

> P12: So I'm clicking on my zoom, and no, you're not up.

> P12: can I? Close out, you know.

> P12: and it's not allowing me to even. I'm marking or touching all over my screen, and it's not allowing me to even close you out.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: Hmm.

> P12: I never had this before.

Tyler: Yeah, I'm a little confused. I wanna try one other thing.

Tyler: Let me try and share my screen, and then let's just see whether or not this shows up for you.

> P12: Okay.

Tyler: Can you see my screen.

> P12: Only thing is oh, no.

Tyler: You just see the.

> P12: How long did I? The only thing I see right now, and zoom part of my the zone apparatus is a black screen with a 2 images of what I would assume would be pictures of people. But it's no, no one's in there.

Tyler: I kind of think that maybe the zoom app is like stuck like it's it needs like a hard reset. Because it doesn't really...

> P12: I would agree with you in that.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: Okay.

> P12: It's not a it's not because it's not even allowing me to actually to close it out to restart like we want to.

Tyler: Yeah, okay, do you have access to a computer or another device nearby?

> P12: I don't right now.

Tyler: Okay, that's not a problem. I'm just thinking about what makes the most sense.

> P12: I like the way you think.

Tyler: I think we kind of have probably 2 options left. So one option is we. You'd probably have to get off this phone call, and we would need to like restart the zoom app. So you know, close out the zoom app somehow and then reopen it, and we would have to start again from there. So we can try that. If you think you might have the patience for that.

> P12: So so what I'm so so you tell. So I'll go back to my email. Well, as we. So so we'll close out the call.

> P12: let me see if I can go to my email right now to see if they would allow me in as another member of this that may.

Tyler: Okay, yeah, let's try that. Let's try that. We might be able to stay on the phone while you do that.

> P12: Right. Right.

> P12: Let me see. Let me click on.

Tyler: Okay.

> P12: Oh, yeah. Doing. Something. New. Yeah.

Tyler: Yeah, I just admitted someone so hopefully, that's your screen.

Tyler: It looks like it's still joining.

> P12: Yeah. So I'm disconnecting, but it still hasn't yet.

Tyler: Hmm, yeah, it's taking out unexpectedly, long time, to join.

> P12: And it may be because again, the I'm on this phone. Oh, no. Something's happened to tell me. I got a a telephone sign. Why is that.

Tyler: I think that's yourself when you talk. Do you see me now?

Tyler: Do I show up on your screen.

> P12: No, no.

Tyler: Not yet.

> P12: No, it's still.

> P12: It's still doing this.

> P12: it has the image of it's a green circle with a looks like a phone in it.

> P12: And and it may be telling us that I'm already in this call on the phone.

> P12: Yeah. So the great yeah, that's more than likely what it's telling me telling us.

Tyler: Yes, yeah, it's a little bit complicated. But the.

> P12: Now you just came up. I just saw you. So so it blink you. But now, coming back to the phone, and maybe when I talk. That may be the case. Hold on.

Tyler: Yes.

> P12: Let me just be quiet for a minute.

Tyler: Yeah, that's exactly what it is. So it's gonna show whoever's talking.

Tyler: And when you're talking, it looks like a green phone. So I think we're on the same page now. Which is awesome. So let's try this. I'm gonna try and share my screen now, and we're gonna see if you can see what I'm seeing.

Tyler: Can you see my screen now on your phone?

> P12: Yes.

Tyler: Okay. So it says, Ask Va.

> P12: Yes.

Tyler: Okay, amazing, all right. So we got here. Thank you so much for your patience. That that is very often really tricky. And it's hard to figure out what's happening when it's not working.

Tyler: I think we did.

> P12: Well again. I have somewhat of the background as well. So from having to gotten into this, that's why we were able to talk through it together to actually get there.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P12: More likely for a veteran that has not engaged as I have with this.

> P12: You wouldn't. We wouldn't have gotten here.

Tyler: Yeah.

### Concept A

Tyler: yeah, sure. Well, thanks, so much. So let me tell you a little bit about we're doing. So we're on a website. This is a prototype, but this looks like va.gov, and we're going to use a tool called ask Va.

Tyler: ask Va is a form that you can use to ask the Va a question.

Tyler: It sounds like you have experience using it in the past. So your question can be about education. It could be about disability, compensation, lots of different topics. And I'm going to show you 3 different concepts or 3 different prototypes in each of these concepts. You're asking the Va a question. We're going to ask the same question. And we're going to go through these 3 different versions. There's going to be some similarities and some differences. And that's what we're going to talk about.

Tyler: Does all of that sound? Okay?

> P12: No, because if I can share, I have used a similar apparatus on the VA, and to their to their that someone from the Va's community sum did reach back to me.

> P12: So I've seen a similar portal like this.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: Gotcha.

> P12: But I've used it. Yeah, so. But definitely we can talk to it. Yes, please go ahead.

Tyler: Awesome. Yeah, that's great that you have experience using Ask VA. And this is going to be similar. But it's also a little bit different. This is a sort of a future idea for something that we might do for ask Va, so it might be a little different to what you've done in the past. And so we're going to look at this together. And I know it's my screen instead of your screen. So I'm going to scroll and click on things when you want me to. But the 1st thing we're going to do is just look at this page.

Tyler: and can you tell me what you would do on this page.

> P12: You say your question required. I would actually put in my question, for that block.

Tyler: So since this is a prototype, I'm not actually able to type today. So I'm just going to click in the box. And this is going to be our question for today. So it says, what resources are available for veterans who need support with mobility or assistive devices?

Tyler: Okay, so we're pretending that we're asking the Va. A question about mobility or assistive devices.

Tyler: Make sense. Okay, what would you do next after you type in your question?

> P12: I'll hit the blue. Continue button.

Tyler: Okay, I'll click on that.

Tyler: And then. Now we're on a new page, and I'm going to give you a moment to read this. I'd love for you to tell me what this page is about.

> P12: I think this is AI trying to discern what my question my initial question was. And then it's gonna talk about Va compensations.

Tyler: Okay, so it used your question to try and figure out what it was about right

Tyler: that makes sense and it says, disability compensation. Do you think disability compensation is what your question is about.

> P12: No, it would not be.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: So if your question was about mobility or assistive devices.

Tyler: can you think of something that you'd expect it to say, instead of disability, compensation.

> P12: It may not be the proper term, but disability apparatuses or connected electronics, something of that nature.

Tyler: Okay, Gotcha. So focused more on the actual device.

Tyler: Right. Okay, gotcha, alright. And so what is this page telling you that you should do.

> P12: I would edit that disability, compensation, and whatever term I would have come up, I would probably put that in next. Probably I would imagine what's gonna happen. And I then I click, continue.

Tyler: Gotcha. Okay. So we're gonna edit it. And then you're expecting that you can type in whatever term you come up with.

> P12: That's correct.

Tyler: Okay, Gotcha, I'm going to click on edit, and we can see what that looks like.

Tyler: So it says, Select the category that best describes your question.

Tyler: I'm gonna click on this.

> P12: Yeah, that would I? That's what I would do.

Tyler: That's what you do. Okay.

> P12: Whatever else it is. Yep.

Tyler: Alright, and I'll let you have a look at this list of options.

> P12: Good signs and technical issues house assistant burial of of all that that the the sharing. I would probably click on that. I'm still having technical issues.

Tyler: Technical issues.

Tyler: Awesome. So you would use this list to try and choose a better option right? That seems pretty straightforward, even though it's a little bit different than what you expected to do. Right? You expect to be able to type something in yeah.

> P12: That's correct.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: So we are going to say that this question is about health care.

> P12: So, and that would that would have been my second choice.

Tyler: That would have been your second choice. Okay? Yeah.

Tyler: And it's, you know, between us, I've looked at this list with a lot of different people. It's not always easy to choose which option. So I can see why technical issues might make sense or healthcare might make sense. So after we chose healthcare, what should we do to continue.

> P12: Save.

Tyler: Save. Okay.

Tyler: And now, can you tell me what's happened?

> P12: They went to what they assume that we want, that that what I wanted, but.

Tyler: Okay.

> P12: My next thing would be to push continue.

Tyler: Okay, let's do that.

Tyler: And then tell me about this page.

> P12: Well again. They're talking about prosthetics, but if I didn't know that prosthetics would handle this particular area, I would probably edit again to look for something closer to related to the technical issue that I had. Anyway, I would look for the editor on this as the lay veterans.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense is, how does healthcare relate to prosthetics? Why does it? Why did we go from healthcare to prosthetics?

> P12: Well, I think because they went to the fact that this is the vice that's helping you.

> P12: Which is our prosthetics and whatnot so healthcare to prosthetics. But you would have to know that.

Tyler: Yeah. Totally.

> P12: You have to then have had some experience with that.

Tyler: Right, it makes sense. Okay? So you can see how prosthetics is related to healthcare. But also you're recognizing that like not everybody's gonna know that prosthetics is the right term for like these assistive mobility devices.

Tyler: Yeah, totally. That makes that makes perfect sense to me. As we went through that those couple of pages. Did you feel like anything? Was automated.

> P12: Yeah. Surely it's obvious that they use AI to try to discern what I was trying to say on the 1st page.

Tyler: Yeah. So they use. So the AI you mentioned earlier was like, they used your question to figure out what your question was about. Right.

> P12: Right.

Tyler: Is that helpful to give you a suggestions.

> P12: It is helpful. But like I said, if you're new to the VA system, or and you're saying that well, I know I need whatever the device is. You might not think prosthetics.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P12: I must say that that yeah, totally. That's not what the lay veteran is going to think.

Tyler: I totally get that. So even though it might be helpful if they make a suggestion to you, it's still not super easy to figure out like which area relates to what you're talking about, particularly for veterans who haven't navigated all aspects of the Va yet.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: so that's really helpful. I want to move on. And we're gonna look at the second concept. So I'm hoping, if I put this in here. It's still sharing on your screen.

Tyler: so you can see my screen right? It says your question.

> P12: Yes, I can.

### Concept B

Tyler: Okay, perfect. So we're gonna look at this second prototype together. This part's really familiar. So tell me what we would do on this page.

> P12: And well, so it says, if you can, you should receive a reply from 7 business days. You tell me, in reference to what we just were talking about? Or was this.

Tyler: Yeah, let me reset. So now we're gonna look at a different version of what we just did. So we're still asking the Va a question. We're starting over from the beginning. So we're gonna start.

> P12: Okay.

Tyler: Typing in our question, does that make sense.

> P12: Okay. Yeah.

Tyler: Cool.

> P12: Yes, yes.

Tyler: Cool. Okay? So for this second one, our question is the same. So we're still asking.

> P12: I won't, Bill.

Tyler: Or assistive devices. Okay, cool, and then go ahead and tell me what we would do next.

> P12: We'll click on that built in.

Tyler: Okay. And I'll scroll down so you can see this page. Tell me what this page is about.

> P12: We think your question about disability. So so there again, AI has is trying to discern what the question actually is, then so what resources are available who need support with mobility assistant devices.

> P12: So that's a better term. That's a better question.

> P12: because it doesn't show. Say, prosthetics does actually say to that veteran, it's it's that we know you need support with mobility and assistive devices. Hopefully, it doesn't just go directly to prosthetics, and that's just how I think, ma'am, so go ahead.

Tyler: No.

Tyler: that's helpful. Let's unpack that a little bit. So you're finding that this is more helpful because it didn't jump straight to prosthetics. What did it do this time? That's different.

> P12: Well, we think that your question is about disability, compensation, and related to how I

> P12: but your question is not going what we think, so that so the AI got it wrong. We think your question is about disability compensation. It relates to how to file a claim that

> P12: that doesn't associate with the actual question that's in the block.

Tyler: Yeah, okay.

Tyler: So you read the suggestion, and you're thinking that again, it's not really the correct suggestion.

Tyler: Okay.

> P12: It's not. It's not about compensation this is about. It's almost like what I was telling you earlier is about me asking about shoes.

> P12: Mobility and assistive devices that would be even closer related than what we're talking about now.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P12: I'm not trying to get us off track, but I again.

Tyler: No, no, it's not off track.

> P12: So I think, through processes and whatnot.

Tyler: I can see exactly what you're noticing. Which is that you asked the you asked a question. And then you've picked up on. There's some sort of automation or AI that's making a suggestion to you, and it's getting it wrong. Right? It's the suggestion it made is wrong. It's not actually about disability compensation.

Tyler: Right?

Tyler: What would you do if it made the wrong suggestion? In this case?

> P12: So again I would edit it again to go right to go back, and I would actually edit it to this and put in this question that they gave to me.

Tyler: And which question did they give to you?

> P12: That I mean the one down there. Your question, what resources are available? I would type that in again and hopefully that it will, it will get that I'm not asking about compensation.

> P12: This, this, again could be, this could become frustrating. If I put this question back in again, and let's come and I get the same result.

Tyler: Yes, okay. So you're thinking that you would take this question like about resources for veterans who need support with mobility or assistive devices. And you would put it in again, and you would hope you'd get a different result if you didn't get a different result. You'd be like this is frustrating. I don't know what to do.

> P12: I would probably. Then I'll be try. Probably want to try to get somebody in person online on the phone. Yes.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: Okay, let's go ahead and click I forgot that I'm sharing my screen. I'm gonna go ahead and scroll down and

Tyler: and there's we have this part here that has your question that you've noticed. What do you think would happen if I clicked edit.

> P12: Ability to retype something else, to get the to make it even closer to your question.

Tyler: Okay, okay? So you can change your question a little bit.

> P12: Right, maybe.

Tyler: Okay, okay, I'll click on edit, we. So we can see it. And this looks like we have your question here.

Tyler: So what would you do so. You've written a question to the Va. It gave you a suggestion that you think is wrong.

Tyler: What would you do here to try and correct it?

> P12: If I was trying to correct that, I would say.

> P12: This is not my or this is my question, or this is not my question. This is not what I'm referring to, or this is so in this situation.

> P12: Like I thought I would leave it as is, and update it again. Update.

Tyler: Okay. So you'd leave it here. And you'd push, update, and you'd see what it brought back like, which results, okay, got it. That makes sense, and you're sort of hoping that it's going to give you let's say that the correct option is health care. So you're hoping that next time. It's gonna say, we think your question is about healthcare, and relates to.

> P12: Right.

### Concept C

Tyler: Okay, gotcha cool. That's helpful. Alright, let's go ahead and switch. And we're gonna look at the last prototype. So I'm gonna just get the link for that one.

Tyler: and we're going to do the same thing where we're resetting. We're back at the beginning of the process. You're asking the Va. Your question.

Tyler: and I'll go ahead and click in here so you can see your question again. It's the same question.

> P12: Okay,

Tyler: And then go ahead and guide me through what we do next.

> P12: Again. I only have half of the screen, but I'll click, continue easily, definitely.

Tyler: Okay.

> P12: Select the category, the category. So I would open up that select category piece.

> P12: so healthcare click on healthcare based on what we did before. Healthcare benefits everybody on adoptive equipment. Say, then, I would go down. See? They did drill it down a little bit, and I will do.

> P12: Well, not automobile or medical supplies the disability benefits. I would go to auto medical supplies is what I would click on.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: so let's talk about this a little that's really helpful to see your path. I can't actually click on order medical supplies with this prototype. But that's super helpful.

> P12: The only reason I say that is because what I was saying earlier. I would think that that's a medical supply, and not necessarily durable medical or whatnot in that sense.

> P12: Even though they were trying to spell it out. CPAP or whatnot.

> P12: my mindset would tell me that the things that we're talking about fall into that category when, in fact, I know they want us to go to healthcare benefit sales adults, but not even that, because it doesn't. None of these work actually for real.

Tyler: okay.

Tyler: you're tell me what you're expecting, like what? Which one would be correct if it was here. What would it say.

> P12: So

> P12: just like when I went to order medical supplies, because I would think that this in in the lay person's term, that I would be looking to

> P12: get this device to help me.

> P12: Looking at all of these options here. Okay, health care benefit sales. Not sure if if you qualify that that has nothing to do with it automobile adaptive equipment.

> P12: so it could fall in that category as well. Because if I don't know that these are separate categories totally separate.

> P12: I'm looking because I'm again. I'm frustrated having a service that was called so made worse by your active duty service. I don't know if you can get this. No, not that has nothing to do with it. So just out of the what? What is shown

> P12: the order, the order of medical supplies, I would hope that somebody's gonna come back by phone or mail to tell me how to do what what I'm trying to, what I was trying to do. Anyway.

Tyler: Okay, Gotcha. So is it true that, like it felt like initially, you were like, Oh, this looks good. This seems more specific. And what I'm talking about, and then you sort of read closer, and you were like no.

> P12: Wait a minute! Hold.

Tyler: Okay, Gotcha, how did it give you this list of links? What is this based on.

> P12: So again. I'm going all the way back. So so. And maybe I, I got messed up here because I'm thinking that we're going back to what? The last.

> P12: what we were discussing on the last one. But now, when I look here, they talk about healthcare, it's what.

> P12: These are so health care. I mean, it's the word is in in the healthcare benefits, eligibility based on your question. We think this information could be helpful.

> P12: And so my information I put in according to this, was healthcare. So automatically, the person is, gonna think again, healthcare. So healthcare is the 1st 2 words of the topic.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P12: We'll likely to click on that.

Tyler: Gotcha. Yeah. So you chose healthcare which helped filter down, which links you would receive.

> P12: All right.

Tyler: Okay, gotcha.

Tyler: All right.

> P12: And just so I'm clear with this, because again, it says, Select the character best describes your question. So the question that pops up in the yellow block is health care.

> P12: So we come down and say helpful resources about healthcare. If if the 1st helpful resource starts off with healthcare.

> P12: I'm probably not even gonna look for benefits. Eligibility. Okay? Healthcare. They. I'm gonna click on that 1 1.st

Tyler: Yeah, gotcha. Okay?

Tyler: Okay? So

Tyler: if you, I'm going to scroll down a little bit because I haven't actually shown you the whole page. So we've picked healthcare. And then we have these resources here. And then why, what would happen if we clicked? Continue.

> P12: It's gonna bring up where we it probably give a a better explanation of each of these to try to associate it with 5 questions, I would think.

> P12: Let's try. Let's see it. Let me see.

Tyler: I will go ahead and show you, so we'll click on. Continue.

Tyler: and then tell me if this is what you expected. It doesn't seem like it.

> P12: So.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P12: So that wouldn't.

Tyler: This.

> P12: Select the top of your question because it's not sure what we're. We're questioning now, which it's almost like they wanna do drill down so they don't send you to the wrong place.

> P12: They give you more options to get you as close to what they thought your question was. Anyway.

Tyler: Okay.

> P12: So because healthcare could be, for it could be about billing and copaying could be about care. So they're trying to get to. So based on what we were talking about first, st

> P12: and this one it I would say, yes, you're taking me back to prosthetics.

> P12: But between you and I, again, if the veteran doesn't know what prosthetics really stands for.

Tyler: Yeah. Totally.

> P12: Yeah.

Tyler: Okay, that makes a lot of sense. So they're trying to drill down like further. So they can get.

> P12: More clear on what your question is about.

Tyler: And it's not super easy to make that selection from this list, at least for all veterans, let's say, and it's particularly hard to know, like prosthetics is the right option. That all makes a lot of sense to me.

Tyler: I'm wondering. So we chose healthcare right?

Tyler: And then.

> P12: Correct.

Tyler: And then we have to choose another selection on this page. But in between that we were given a bunch of links with other information right.

> P12: Correct.

Tyler: Why were we given those links.

> P12: So so we can actually get on our own, be able to go and see if we could figure out from those links

> P12: that they're those links, I'm sure, would have addressed each of each link had something different that was more specific.

> P12: So if we came back after we looked at the link, we wouldn't know which way to which, what? Out of all these categories drill down, it would have pointed us back to prosthetics when you would have to and understand.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P12: That you have to know.

> P12: So yeah, so that's the other thing with these quarters in that sense. areas like prosthetics or whatnot. I think there should be a slight, a definition as to what that means at somewhere, that you can go to a library or something of that nature in that sense, and and that it actually again, that the lay veteran could understand it.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P12: And I know a lot of times. It's Phds that's doing these things. We know. We we better get into communities to understand how the late veteran understands.

### Cool down

Tyler: Yeah, a hundred percent. I'm gonna stop sharing my screen. I don't want to alarm you when I do that. But I know we're at the hour. This has been like, really useful to talk through this with you. I think I can share a little bit about why we're doing this right now, in order to ask the Va a question, you need to choose a category and a topic so that we can figure out who should answer your question. And we're trying to think about ways that we might automate some of this process. And we showed you a couple different ways that that could work.

Tyler: And in particular, we're showing you what happens if we get it wrong. So we got it wrong. We said, disability compensation, even though that's not what your questions about, and watching you go through these prototypes helped me better understand ways. We might change the process of doing this, or where it's more useful for veterans if we, if we make suggestions here instead of here, or whatever it is. So that's a little bit about what we're doing

Tyler: Is there anything else you wanted to share with me before we wrap up.

> P12: Only thing I would say again.

Tyler: Oh, no, I can't hear you.

> P12: Oh, wow! And and I'll use this as

> P12: and I'll say this as an advocate veteran.

> P12: We've got to help by going directly into communities where we have veterans, populations not necessarily waiting for them to come, because the more knowledgeable the the veteran is

> P12: him or her, the more that we can help you help us.

> P12: The more knowledgeable they are, and that that and that takes some time just going directly into communities.

> P12: That have our population and have conversations like we're doing right now. I think this was, this is great, but I think you could put this on A, and this is something that my little small nonprofit. So you can take that [they're organization]. I could go through this process and have 50 veterans in front of me

> P12: in a community forum, or you.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P12: Send out somebody to do this. That's what would work.

Tyler: Yeah, and that sounds really awesome. I think all of the like community level groundwork and advocacy that people like yourself do is really like super key to making all of this reach

Tyler: everybody. So I know I appreciate the work you're doing. I would love to see us doing more research in that sort of way.

Tyler: And yeah, I think as an alternative, this is good. And again, I'm not trying to just.

> P12: My own horn. But you got the right guy today.

> P12: I mean that that that have, that have actually worked the processes.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P12: And seeing it in that sense.

> P12: Another veteran may you know he, he or she again may have gotten frustrated, even going through the process that you was doing.

Tyler: Yeah, definitely, yeah. And that's 1 of the reasons we think it's important to talk to a lot of veterans when we do research like this, because people's reactions are different. But generally you can get a sense for like, Oh, this is the part that's really not working well. Or this is the part that we really need to fix. So anyways, I really appreciate your time. For that reason, it really helps us improve what we're doing and make better decisions. So thank you so much.

> P12: Is the fact that I appreciate that you guys are doing this, that you understand that it needs to be done.

Tyler: Yes. Yeah.

> P12: That's the win!

Tyler: That is a win

Tyler: I totally agree with you, and I'm happy. I got to do this today with you. So have a great rest of your day. I hope you take part in research in the future. I'm going to get back to you about the recording.

> P12: Okay.

Tyler: So you can find out if you can get that recording. And Shannon will email you.

> P12: And you can use my name. My name is you said you didn't get it. My, my name is [name].

> P12: I'm willing to go in and help where we can. We need to do more for our veterans.

> P12: Thank you. Thank you.

Tyler: Yeah, thank you so much. I hope you have a great rest of your day, and I hope to see you back here at some point in the future.

> P12: Alright, ma'am, thank you.

Tyler: Okay, thank you. You, too. Bye.
