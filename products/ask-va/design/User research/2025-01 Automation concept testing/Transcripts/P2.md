Tyler: Alright. So I started the recording. And I just wanna confirm, are you comfortable? If I record my screen and audio today.

> P2: Yes, I am.

Tyler: Okay, awesome. Do you have any questions for me? I know that was a lot of information.

> P2: No, no, it's fine!

Tyler: Okay, cool. Well, before we get started, looking at some prototypes, I do just want to learn a little bit more about you and your experience with the Va. How long have you been a Veteran.

> P2: Since 2002.

Tyler: Okay. And did you start interacting with the Va in 2,002 or.

> P2: No, I got married to another service member right before I got out. So I was in the TriCare system.

> P2: and so I probably started using the VA in 2008.

Tyler: Okay, and what about these days? Like, how do you interact with the va, do you use them for your healthcare.

> P2: Everything. Yeah. Healthcare dental therapy. Even housing they've helped me with.

Tyler: Okay. Awesome. How often would you say you contact the Va these days?

> P2: At least twice a month.

Tyler: Okay, who are you usually contacting in those cases?

> P2: I usually use secure messaging. Contact my providers, or I see somebody in an appointment.

Tyler: Okay, gotcha. and what if you have like questions that are unrelated to healthcare? So like, maybe about housing like, how would you go about contacting the Va. In those cases.

> P2: Well, with housing I would contact my representative because I have vash. So I have a housing contact. for anything else. I guess I would just call the Va. Number and ask where to be directed.

Tyler: Okay, Gotcha. So like that 1 800 Va. Number?

> P2: Yeah.

Tyler: Cool that makes sense. Have you ever heard of or use the Va Chatbot.

> P2: No.

Tyler: Okay, that's okay. And what about something called Ask, Va, have you ever heard of? Ask Va.

> P2: I've seen. I've seen it pop up on the website when I've been on there, but I've never used it.

Tyler: Okay, gotcha well, we're gonna talk a little bit more about ask Va today.

Tyler: But before we do that I'm curious. If you think about these like past experiences you've had

Tyler: contacting the Va, it sounds like you're often using like secure messaging or maybe calling someone on the phone. What is important to you when you think about a good experience contacting the Va.

> P2: Getting some reply. Within 2 days.

Tyler: Okay.

> P2: Is a good experience.

Tyler: Yeah, so definitely like the timeliness of the replies, yeah, that's really helpful.

Tyler: so we're going to shift gears, a little bit. Another thing we're going to talk about during this hour is

Tyler: automation. So when I say automation, I'm talking about like when we use computers to do work that normally people would do manually. So it might be like having a helper who summarizes an article for you or gives you a recommendation.

Tyler: Do you know if you've ever used an online tool or service that includes some type of automation.

> P2: Wait! Can you say that again.

Tyler: Yeah, of course. So I'm thinking about automation kind of quite generally, it's just like when a computer is doing work that people would normally do manually. So I can give one example.

Tyler: using something like a spell check or like grammarly, there's some you're typing something into your computer like into a text document. And then it's giving you a suggestion, maybe on how to like rephrase a sentence. So some of that process is being automated and being done by the computer rather than like the person doing it manually.

> P2: Okay.

Tyler: That makes sense, do you? There's other ways like automation can come up. And I'm just curious if, like anything is top of mind for you when I, when I say that.

> P2: No, I can't think of anything. Yeah.

Tyler: That's totally fine.

Tyler: Well, we're going to talk more about it today, and I'll ask you some more questions as we go along. But if we kind of like, take a step back and think about like automation, or you could even think about like artificial intelligence or AI, do you have any like immediate hesitations or concerns. When you hear those words.

> P2: No, no, I it's I. Kinda

> P2: I get excited. Things are gonna be streamlined.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense. And it's okay, if if it's not clear yet or you can't think of anything, but I'm curious, if there's ways that your interactions with the Va could benefit from like things being more streamlined or using automation to make something easier for you.

> P2: No, I not. I can't think of anything off the top of my head.

### Concept A

Tyler: Yeah, that's totally fine. Well, I think we're gonna talk more about that. But let's go ahead and get ourselves set up with this 1st prototype. So we're gonna look at 3 different prototypes. Today, they're gonna be 3 different concepts.

Tyler: and for all of these we're going to be using a tool called, Ask Va, ask, Va is a form. You can use this form to contact the Va with a question.

Tyler: Your question could be about anything. It could be about education, disability, compensation, healthcare. And we're going to look at these 3 different concepts that are doing things like similarly, but different to one another, and I'll ask you some questions as we go through each one.

> P2: Okay, do you.

Tyler: Do you have any questions about that.

> P2: No.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So it is a little finicky. Because I'm gonna actually ask you to share your screen on your phone. And then I'm gonna send you things in the chat on Zoom.

Tyler: Okay, have you shared your screen on zoom before.

> P2: I I haven't. I'm familiar with all the choices like the share, but I've never actually done it.

Tyler: Okay, that's cool. So if you can see the share button right now on your zoom window, you can go ahead and share your screen. If you're not seeing that, just let me know.

Tyler: Not seeing it yet, but I'll let you know.

> P2: Oh, I just hit stop. Sorry.

Tyler: No worries.

Tyler: Okay, perfect

Tyler: cool. So I'm seeing what you're seeing. It says, like, screen broadcast, yeah, and then usually, if you like, click just anywhere outside of that. So if you click up on like everything on your screen that text up there.

Tyler: it should take us out of this funny screen. Okay.

Tyler: I think that that might be right

Tyler: perfect. That looks good. And then if you if you click on the bottom of your screen where it says Chat, you might have to tap in the middle. Yeah.

> P2: I got it.

Tyler: Perfect. Okay, I'm gonna share something in the chat. So there's just a link that's just popped up. And hopefully, you can click on that link, and we'll open it up on your phone.

Tyler: and it might take a second to load

Tyler: but it looks like it's coming up.

Tyler: Oh, it's feeling a little slow this morning. Okay, you can go ahead and X out of that, like little pop up at the bottom.

Tyler: Perfect.

Tyler: alrighty. So we're gonna be looking at this together like I said, this is a website called, Ask Va where you can get answers to your questions.

Tyler: without clicking anything yet. Feel free to scroll around this page and then tell me what you would do here.

> P2: I would type my question in and hit continue.

Tyler: Okay, cool. That seems pretty straightforward. We, we can't actually type in the prototype. So go ahead and click in the box where you would type your question. And then we're gonna have a question appear. So we're pretending like this is your question. So what resources are available for Veterans who need support with mobility or assistive devices. And then I think you clicked. Continue right.

> P2: Sorry.

Tyler: That's okay. All good. So let's stay on this page now, and we won't click anything yet. But you're welcome to scroll around and once you've read some of this page, tell me what this page is about.

> P2: It's a

> P2: a category that's asking me if this is what I want to hear about or learn about, and then I would hit, continue to learn more about disability compensation, and if I want to change that, I could edit it.

Tyler: Okay? And why does it say disability, compensation? Why is that? What's it's suggested.

> P2: I don't know.

Tyler: Okay.

> P2: I guess it just it just guessed that's where I was wanting to go.

Tyler: Yeah, how did what was it guessing? Based off of.

> P2: The question we typed in.

Tyler: Okay?

Tyler: So it used your question. And it was like, based on this question, we think this is where you want to go.

> P2: If I don't think if I think that it's wrong, maybe I could hit edit, and

> P2: maybe there will be a list to scroll through. I'm gonna.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense. And why is it like, why do you need to have a category like, why does it need to be disability, compensation, or something else.

Tyler: What's the purpose of the category?

> P2: To give me information.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: so you think like, if you pick disability compensation for example, then we won't click on it. But if we click to continue, you would get some information about disability compensation that relates to your question.

> P2: Yeah, that's what I would ask.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: that makes sense. So let me tell you your question. I know this is a bit hypothetical, but let's say that you were asking about resources that are available for Veterans who need support with mobility or assistive devices.

Tyler: Do you think that disability compensation would be the right option.

> P2: I would start looking. There.

Tyler: Yeah, okay.

> P2: If I didn't see anything I'd probably go back and hit Edit and see if I could find some other category that was closer.

Tyler: Gotcha. Okay? So you would like start reviewing some information about disability compensation. And that would tell you whether or not you're in the right place.

> P2: Yeah.

Tyler: That makes sense.

Tyler: Okay, so let's go ahead and click on edit you kind of describe to me, what you think is gonna happen. Let's see what happens.

> P2: Yep, that's what I thought.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: And so, what are we looking at now?

> P2: Housing. Well, my 1st would be housing assistance, but I guess I would just keep checking to see if there was

> P2: something else.

> P2: But I can't. I can't. Oh, yeah, I can scroll

Tyler: And if it's helpful, I'll just remind you, your question is about support with mobility or assistive devices.

Tyler: Do any of these feel like that fits.

> P2: Gosh! I

> P2: like, I think I think, housing assistance if I needed a wheelchair ramp, but if I was like needing like a back brace. I would go to Healthcare. And I don't know what other mobility devices, even a wheelchair. I would think healthcare.

> P2: I wouldn't think disability compensation, but I might think disability compensation. If I was like missing my leg, and I needed my car to be altered so that I could drive it, then maybe I would think it might be in disability, compensation.

Tyler: Okay, so.

> P2: That'd be a tough one, because there's a lot of different. It depends on what I was looking for.

Tyler: Yeah, that's really helpful. So just to say it back to you, it sounds like depending on what aid you actually needed, you might choose different categories. So it makes it kind of hard to make a decision.

> P2: Yeah.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. And I think the ones you pointed out make perfect sense, like disability, compensation, healthcare or housing assistance. That that makes sense to me.

Tyler: we're gonna say that your question is about healthcare. So let's go ahead and choose healthcare and show me what you would do after you choose that.

> P2: I click on save show you. What should I do?

Tyler: Yeah, yeah, you can go ahead and click, save perfect. Okay? And so tell me what's happened. Now.

> P2: Now it has highlighted my choice, and is giving me the option to learn more about that.

Tyler: Okay?

Tyler: And so, without clicking on anything, what would you do in order to learn more about healthcare?

> P2: I will click on Continue.

Tyler: Okay, gotcha, okay, so let's click on continue

Tyler: and then scroll down and let me know what we're seeing on this page.

> P2: I'd be frustrated by Vet centers and readjustment counseling, because that wouldn't be what I would think that I would find those kinds of mobility aids.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P2: But maybe they have them at vet centers. I would just think that I'd be going to like the,  there's a part in the VA Hospital, where you go and get like inserts for your feet or a back brace. And this isn't that so?

> P2: I don't think I'd be in the right place. So I maybe I click edit and see what was there before I went back and started over.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: that makes sense so automatically like, you're kind of frustrated because it feels like it's given you the wrong.

> P2: Yeah, readjustment counseling. I'm like, okay, like, if I lost a leg and I needed to readjust to civilian life. But that wouldn't be mobility. But maybe with the Va. Sometimes you have to get into a program before they'll help you with certain things. So I think maybe I'd have to do that first.st So.

> P2: But if it wasn't that I'd be frustrated that I lost pressure. Well.

Tyler: You know what I mean? Yeah, totally trying to find the answer there.

Tyler: for sure. That makes sense. Why, like, before, we chose healthcare, why is it now saying? Vet centers and readjustment, counseling.

> P2: I have no idea.

Tyler: Yeah, do you think that.

> P2: I guess that centers. Maybe it means like

> P2: that, like Va medical centers. Maybe that's what it's saying. But then readjustment counseling really throws me off.

Tyler: Yeah. that makes sense. So it's like hard to see why we've landed with this after we chose healthcare.

> P2: Yeah.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: and you mentioned that you could go ahead and edit it. But at this point like i'm sensing, you're like a little frustrated with the process of needing to.

> P2: Yeah, cause I'd be starting to second. Guess myself like should I? Did I click on the wrong thing? Should I go double check what I clicked on.

> P2: Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: So we can just go ahead and finish here on this this concept. So we'll just leave this up. But I kind of want to zoom out and just think about like we talked about some of the things that you found frustrating, particularly with it, giving you the wrong suggestion, and then that making it hard for you to feel confident in kind of like what you'd already input

Tyler: yeah, is there anything about this process that you did like.

> P2: I think if honestly, if I was doing this.

> P2: I would call the Va. And just ask. I wouldn't want to go through all these questions, what would I like that? I didn't have to call. But at this point I'd be frustrated that I didn't just call.

> P2: Yeah.

Tyler: Okay, yeah.

Tyler: So you're frustrated enough with this that you would have like regretted, not just calling instead makes sense.

> P2: I mean. At this point I might just click, continue to see where it was taking me, but I would I would be really leaning towards just doing a phone call.

Tyler: Yeah, makes sense.

Tyler: And it sounds like you would click, continue. And you would expect or like, hope, that you're gonna get information about your question right?

> P2: Yeah, yeah.

Tyler: That makes sense.

Tyler: Did you feel like any part of the process that we just went through? Was automated.

> P2: Yeah.

Tyler: Okay, what can.

> P2: That's my little, because the questions I asked didn't lead me anywhere fruitful. So I would have thought that it was definitely automated.

> P2: It automatically chose, based on what it thought. I wanted.

Tyler: Okay. So it was making automated automatic choices based on your question.

Tyler: And it almost feels like because it wasn't making the right choices. It was more noticeable.

> P2: Yeah.

Tyler: Yeah, do you think it was helpful to have like, right? Here, it's attempting to guess what your topic is that helpful.

> P2: It would be helpful if it was close, but I don't know how healthcare would lead to this, so.

> P2: Vet centers and readjustment counseling would really really throw me off, because I wouldn't think vet centers like Va. Hospital. I would think vet centers like something else, some other kind of place.

Tyler: Yeah, gotcha. So because this like is hard to understand how this relates to healthcare, it's like, it's difficult to see the automation being helpful in some way.

> P2: Yeah.

Tyler: Yeah, I can totally see that.

Tyler: Okay, let's start looking at the next concept. So you can keep sharing your screen.

Tyler: And if you're able to find the zoom window, so there's different ways. You could find that

Tyler: if you prefer, you could click on my face, or you might be able to just like, swipe up on your phone and see the different applications.

> P2: Oh!

### Concept B

Tyler: Perfect. That's perfect. So we'll stay there on the chat, and then I'm gonna send you a new link. So I have just sent you the link.

Tyler: And if you can open that one up

Tyler: perfect. Okay, so we're gonna look now, at the second concept, there's gonna be things that feel familiar or the same. And then there's gonna be things that are different. -Oh, do you need to?

Tyler: Yeah, you heard that.

> P2: In that, in that zone.

Tyler: No worries. You can take your time if you need to find your charger.

> P2: I got it. I just wanna be in the other room. So I'm gonna grab it and plug it in out there.

Tyler: Okay, perfect

Tyler: while you do that, I'll kind of talk to you about what we're gonna do next. So.

> P2: Okay.

Tyler: We're going to look at this next concept. And there's going to be things that are similar to the last one we looked at and things that are different. So when you're all set up, you let me know, and we'll go ahead and start with this one.

> P2: I was like. Did you hear that? How did you know on the screen.

Tyler: That's kind of creepy. Yeah, I did see the little screen.

> P2: So yeah, we're all set now.

Tyler: Okay, perfect. Alright. So go ahead and scroll down and look at this page. And I think this is gonna look familiar.

Tyler: And so we can do what we did last time, where we're gonna pretend, like you've written in a question. So you can click on the question box.

> P2: Okay.

Tyler: And so our question is the same. It's what resources are available for Veterans who need support with mobility or assistive devices. And then we can go ahead and click, continue just like you did before.

Tyler: Okay, so tell me what tell me this page, or what's just happened.

> P2: It's just kind of guessing.

> P2: It's weird that it's guessing this.

> P2: But it's guessing that I want information about disability, compensation.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P2: I mean, I guess if you have a disability that's related to a physical

> P2: issue, there's hope for you there. So I might follow this rabbit hole to see if it's gonna take me where I need to go.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: I kind of get the sense that as it makes suggestions to you, it makes you a little unsure about what you previously thought like, now you're like, maybe it is about disability. Compensation. Is that true?

> P2: I know that when you get your disability there's also claims you can make in that area for devices such as a car alteration or a wheelchair ramp or home modification. So I would think, maybe that's what is that like taking me to, or what kind of mobility was I looking for?

Tyler: It was very general, so it was just mobility and assistive devices.

> P2: Yeah, I mean, like, if I was the Veteran, I would. I mean, if this was for real, I would know what I was looking for. If I was looking for a wheelchair or a walker.

> P2: Versus something, then I would.

> P2: But really, no, this isn't where I would think I would need to go.

> P2: Yeah, I would probably be trying to fix fit the square toy into the round hole at this point.

> P2: Yeah, like.

> P2: make sure. I cause I think I think sometimes AI knows what it's talking about, and I'm the one that's confused. I always defer to that which is probably not the best thing to do.

Tyler: Yeah, no, but that's really fair. And I think that's like a really useful takeaway for me is like, I can see how it starts to make you think, oh, maybe I'm wrong, and this is right. And then the other thing you pointed out just now, which is helpful is probably when you write your question you would try and be more specific, so that you would end up with like a better option. Right.

> P2: Yeah, yeah, because I use chat Gpt, and I know that I have to be really specific. Or I have to rewrite the question so that it understands exactly what I'm asking in order to get me to the right place.

Tyler: Gotcha. Yeah, cool.

Tyler: Let's scroll down just so you can see the rest of the page.

Tyler: Oops. Sorry.

> P2: See you.

Tyler: And

Tyler: if it's helpful, too, like it's up to you if you want to keep my face there. But you can also just like. Swipe it away if it's in the way.

> P2: Oh, it's fine!

Tyler: Okay?

Tyler: You can scroll up a little bit. So it looks like, now we're in like the footer or the very bottom of the page.

Tyler: And then we'll just scroll up to like. I'll tell you when to stop.

> P2: The need help, part or.

Tyler: Yeah, this is perfect right here. So we can see this, this part of the page. So it says, like your question, and then it has an edit button, and then it lists your question right? So what is it asking you to do.

> P2: It's asking me to change my question or to go ahead and follow this to the next. To the next answer.

Tyler: Okay, so how is this different to what we did before? If you can remember.

> P2: I think we edited it last time. For some reason I feel like we edited it. It's hard to remember.

Tyler: Yeah, that's okay.

Tyler: So last time we edited your category, right? So it said, compensation.

Tyler: And this time, what are we doing? That's different.

> P2: It's asking me more questions. Or asking me if this is my question.

Tyler: Okay.

> P2: What resources? Yeah, this is a different way to go. What resources are available.

Tyler: Okay.

> P2: Yeah, yeah, this this would be a more helpful rabbit hole to follow, cause I think

> P2: at least it will give me a list of options where I can start making phone calls or sending messages.

Tyler: Yeah, so so what are you expecting to happen? If you like? Click on this, then this will happen.

> P2: I'm expecting it. A list of resources, either websites or phone numbers.

> P2: Give me more information about the mobility device I needed.

Tyler: Okay. And that would be like if you clicked Continue, you would expect that list of resources.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense. Let's

Tyler: let's do this i feel like my face is a little bit in the way of some of the screen. So maybe you can move me like to the bottom? Or, yeah, yeah, we're to the side either way. So it's saying on here. If this is correct, continue or try adding more information to your question.

> P2: Yeah, I would. I would add specific information at this point, like.

> P2: I would actually just say, How can I find information about getting a and then I'd put the device I needed.

Tyler: Okay?

Tyler: So you would try and make your question.

> P2: Actually no, right now I would just hit, continue, and see what it was, and if I couldn't find it there I'd hit back, and then I'd edit it and change it.

Tyler: Gotcha. Okay? So it's a little bit hard for you to like

Tyler: almost to like make changes until you know that you've done the wrong thing right? And at this point you don't know that it's wrong.

> P2: Yeah, well, I always think maybe it's wrong when it comes to like an automated system like this. So I know I know there's some trial and error, so I would probably continue 1st do a scroll, see if there's anything there, and then hit back and get more specific. If I had to.

Tyler: Okay, Gotcha, cool that that's super helpful. So

Tyler: let's do this. Let's go ahead and edit your question.

> P2: Okay.

Tyler: So you can go ahead and show me how you do that. And then now we're seeing your question right? So it sounds like you would put in here like the more specific aid that you would be looking for. We can't actually type again in this prototype. So you can just click in that text box.

Tyler: And then we're just going to pretend like. What you've done is you've added more detail, or you've made your question more specific.

Tyler: So after you've done that, what would you do next? To continue.

> P2: Update yeah.

Tyler: Okay, yeah, go ahead and click, update.

Tyler: Alright. And now, what's what are we looking at now?

> P2: I'd be so frustrated.

> P2: I I would say no, but I wouldn't want to go any further, because I was like, where did you go to that.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P2: Health care release, I mean.

> P2: no cause. At this point I could just call the 1 800 number down there and get information.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: So it's like, it's 1 thing if they make a a wrong recommendation once, but if they do it another time, it's really frustrating.

> P2: Yeah, yeah, I'd be like, I'm done. I'm not doing this.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: that makes sense, and it so it gives you those 2 options. You did say you would choose. No, although you'd rather call if you chose. No, what do you think it would? What would happen after that?

> P2: It would take me back to let me scroll and narrow it down some more.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: so let's do that real quick. I know this is probably not what you would do at this point, but let's click no, and then tell me about this page. Now.

> P2: I'd be like oh, shit! I don't know.

Tyler: Yeah, I'd be like, I don't know what to do.

> P2: I mean, now that I know what we were looking at, I would probably go into disability compensation.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P2: Just see if there's allowances for what I needed, because I would know it would be something to do with allowances. But If I didn't know that I really wouldn't know what to do here at all. I could be wrong that it's not allowances, but that's where I would be. Jumping to.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P2: But I'd also be frustrated because I feel like the answer would be hard to find through the phone as well. That could be a delicate issue. If I didn't have some kind of liaison or help or. I would hate to. I'd hate to have to contact an outside agency. Just for this kind of question.

Tyler: Right. Yeah.

Tyler: So it feels like, this is the kind of question like the Va. Should be able to answer for you. But it's not a very simple process. So far.

> P2: Yeah, it seems like I should have like a by now. I should have some kind of a couple of emails or phone numbers, or at least information, telling me who to call at the Va.

> P2: Or what form to fill out, or something like that, I would hope at this point. But but going and seeing these options, I would just be frustrated.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: And when we look at this list of options, so there's like 6 options here.

Tyler: And if your question was like about mobility and assistive devices. Do you think you would choose one of these options, or would you choose, like other.

> P2: I might go to health care. I might think that's the only place left for me.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P2: Wouldn't go to other. Because if I would think at this point that these are the only options that this actual program has.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P2: I'd have to go to where it's

> P2: where it most likely would lead.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

> P2: And I would be.

> P2: I'm torn between disability, compensation, and health care so I wouldn't know which one to click on.

> P2: I wouldn't think disability compensation. But then I would also think, well, maybe I do have to put in paperwork for it, so it might be in that category.

Tyler: Right? Yeah, I get the sense that it's really hard to make these decisions with like this limited information.

> P2: Yeah.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: Okay, so we are gonna like end using this prototype here and let's just like zoom out for a, second. There were some things that were frustrating about this process.

> P2: Wait! How do I zoom out.

Tyler: Oh, sorry! I just meant like, metaphorically.

> P2: Trying to like shrink.

Tyler: Yeah. So let's metaphorically zoom out. And just like

Tyler: about, I know there was things that were frustrating about this process. It was a little different to the other one. So in this process you were given a choice like we said, we think your question is about this.

Tyler: If it's not, do you want to edit your question?

Tyler: How does that compare to before where we were like? We think your question is about this, if it's not. Do you want to change the selection?

Tyler: Do you have a preference between those 2.

> P2: Now.

> P2: now I don't, because I'm not really sure if editing the question would take me to the right place, because it didn't the 1st time, and then selecting didn't bring me to the right place either, so probably selecting would be better than editing. Honestly.

Tyler: Yeah, why do you think.

> P2: Maybe I'm just not speaking the right language of the app that I'm using, like not putting in the right keywords or putting in the right little words to wrap it all up.

Tyler: Yeah, yeah, it's kind of giving you like, lower confidence in your like ability to almost like converse with the website.

> P2: Yeah, I feel like, maybe I just don't have what it takes to get to the next level.

> P2: No, maybe this I mean, obviously, I would think. Obviously it works for some people because it's here. But it's not working for me.

Tyler: Yeah, yeah, for sure.

### Concept C

Tyler: Okay, cool. I can see how that's like very frustrating. Let's do one. Let's look at one more prototype. So you can come back to zoom perfect. And then I'm gonna share this last link

Tyler: awesome. So we'll let that load.

Tyler: Yeah, there we go.

Tyler: and this is going to be similar to before. And there's going to be some some key differences in this concept. So you can go ahead and lead me through the beginning of this process.

> P2: Okay? I would type my question in and hit continue.

Tyler: Okay, cool. You can go ahead. And do that.

> P2: I was like, am I wrong? It seems like a simple.

Tyler: No. Yeah.

> P2: Profile, answer alright, and then hit, continue.

Tyler: Yep, perfect.

> P2: Oh, okay.

> P2: Oh, wait a minute.

> P2: Oh, hey?

> P2: Well, I guess it depends on what I'm looking for here.

> P2: Like if I'm looking for cpap or prosthetic stuff.

> P2: But if I was looking for like help altering my car I wouldn't know where.

> P2: I still don't know exactly what we're looking for in the, in the mobility, aid.

Tyler: Yeah, yeah, because in this case you've asked a more general question. So that is a little tricky. But I kind of sense that you were like, Oh, okay, like, when you saw this page. What was your like? Reaction to seeing this page.

> P2: Oh, here's some more options! That was my 1st reaction.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: And now we're looking at a list.

> P2: Yeah.

> P2: Yeah. Again, it would depend on what I'm looking for, because I would do housing assistance and home loans if it had to do with like making a change to my domicile, for my mobility.

> P2: But if it was something that I was trying to get help with so I could work, maybe I would go to

> P2: VR. And D.

Tyler: Okay, so there's different reasons why you might choose different categories.

> P2: I wouldn't go to secure messaging, though, because I wouldn't know cause you have to click what department and I wouldn't know what department, so I definitely wouldn't go there.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: Let's like close out of this list. So you might just have to like click to like the side perfect. And then let's look at these. So we had that one list that we just had open. And then we have this list. What's the difference between the 2 lists.

> P2: This gives me, more reasonable options for what I might be looking for.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P2: Like healthcare benefits eligibility if I was like in the system. But I wasn't sure if something I was looking for was covered.

> P2: I would go to health, care benefits. And then, if it was like, I said, like do any prosthetic socks, or because that

> P2: I don't know. Those are Cpap. I don't know if I'd consider that mobility, but I would think maybe medical supplies would be the area I'd be looking for.

Tyler: Yeah, so I feel like.

> P2: Disability benefits. I mean, if I had a certain percentage I might think that it was covered there. So maybe I would click on that, too, depending on what I was looking for. Again.

Tyler: Yeah, I think I'm noticing like a pretty key distinction between these lists is like, this list feels more related to what you're asking about, even if it didn't get it perfect.

> P2: Yeah, yeah, it's definitely much closer. It would definitely help me feel like we are getting somewhere.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: And it's slightly more specific, right? Like, instead of saying healthcare, it says, like, order medical supplies.

Tyler: And I think that's resonating with you.

Tyler: Yeah. And obviously, we also have some descriptions here, like, we're talking about cpap and prosthetics. And I think that that is also helpful, because it's providing, like a little bit more information than some of the other lists like where it just says disability, compensation.

Tyler: So I think those are really helpful things to notice.

Tyler: these are links like it looks like there are things, we can click on right,

Tyler: that previous list that we had the drop down. Menu, we were looking at those aren't links right.

> P2: No, I thought they were leading me to another page like this.

Tyler: Okay. So you're thinking.

> P2: If we click on a link.

Tyler: Gotcha cool. That makes sense. So I get the sense that through all of the concepts we looked at, you're sort of thinking that like, I'm gonna give information to this thing. And then it's gonna come back and give me information, kind of like in real time, right.

Tyler: Okay, gotcha.

### Cool down

Tyler: Let's go ahead and close the. You can stop sharing your screen now, so there'll be like a little red part at the top and then perfect.

Tyler: Alright. So we've got like about 15 min, and I think we'll just spend some time like thinking about those different concepts and our overall reflections.

Tyler: We looked at 3 different things. It might be a little bit hard to remember each of them in your head if that's the case, that's okay, I can remind you. But do any of those 3 ideas stand out to you right now. Was there any 3? Any one of the 3 concepts that you liked the best.

> P2: Now you mean like which one of the the options, like the question box.

Tyler: kind of. So this is what I'll do. I'll describe all of them. A little bit. So the 1st option you were provided a suggestion, a suggested category right? And then you got to change your category. And then in the next one you were provided a suggested category, and you got to change your question. So of those ones it seemed like we kind of came to the conclusion. It was easier to choose a category like yourself between those 2, and then in this 3rd one it was a little different, like in that instance, you were actually provided with some helpful links.

Tyler: So if we think about like being suggested, what your question is about, or like the category of your question, or we think about being provided helpful links.

> P2: Yeah, the links are definitely more of what I'm looking for.

Tyler: Yeah, okay. do you think there was like any automation involved in that last concept where we had the links.

> P2: Yeah.

> P2: Yeah, it was generating a list.

Tyler: Based on your question.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: So one thing I noticed like throughout this whole process is for each of these ideas. It felt like you were trying to like it was leading you to get information right. And I think that's something that maybe wasn't super clear in the in the prototypes. So I'm going to tell you a little bit more about ask Va.

Tyler: So when you use Ask VA right now, you would go in and you would answer some questions, and then eventually you would submit your question to the Va. And then the Va. Can take up to 7 business days to review your question, and then they get back to you.

Tyler: So it's a more like asynchronous process. It's not happening in real time.

Tyler: Yeah. And it felt like you were expecting in real time you would get some information

Tyler: is that fair to say?

> P2: Right.

Tyler: And so with this 3rd idea, what we were trying to show is like, what if we gave you some information in real time? So some links that you could click on, or if they didn't work for you, you could continue and submit your question.

> P2: Yeah, I like that.

Tyler: Yeah, okay.

> P2: But I don't like the idea of not being able to choose.

> P2: Like I would like to be able to choose to.

> P2: if I'm like. I don't want to go through these links. I just want to submit my question. That's what I'd want that to be. My option as well.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: and you want it to maybe to be more clear. Because I think I got the sense that it wasn't clear to you that it was either like, Go read these links, or submit a question.

> P2: Yeah, it wasn't. But I really like that that is an option, because there's some days you just don't want to deal with jumping down different rabbit holes to find your answer. Sometimes you'd rather just send a question and wait a week to get an answer. If it's not something. You need some information on right away.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: And then in general, like this idea of a category. So like, let's say, you ask the question about mobility or assistive devices. And then it says, Your category is disability compensation? Why is there a category like, why do we need to know that it's disability, compensation.

> P2: So it takes us to.

Tyler: The right options, the right resources.

Tyler: So it points you to the right resources.

> P2: Yes.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: so one of the reasons we need to know that is so that we can send your question to the right department in the VA. Do you think? Do you think that that was clear?

> P2: No, I thought by clicking on that it was gonna take me to a list of resources that I could click on to find more information and then to contact someone.

Tyler: Yeah, is it helpful to know that we're trying to figure out where to send your question.

> P2: Yeah, yeah, it does help.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: And then, at 1.1 of the concepts mentioned that it was using past Veterans questions. So people who have asked similar questions to you.

Tyler: Yeah, we grow.

Tyler: You remember that.

> P2: Yeah.

Tyler: Did you have any like feelings like for or against reading that message?

> P2: I guess it made me feel positive that other people were asking similar questions. Honestly. That somebody else had gone down this path.

Tyler: Yeah, yeah, that's a good point. Do you think that like.

Tyler: i'm going to ask, you, kind of a random question. are you familiar with the term data model.

> P2: No.

Tyler: Okay, that's fair. So a data model is like a blueprint. And it basically defines how we collect data and we store it. And we analyze it. So if I told you that we were recommending something to you based on a data model we used, what would that mean to you?

> P2: You pulled a bunch of different responses and answers and came up with the best one.

Tyler: Okay.

> P2: Is that what it is?

Tyler: I think that's along the lines. Do you think it's helpful to know that it's a data model? Or it's the kind of information you don't need to know.

> P2: It might soften some irritation that I had dealing with the program.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: And why do you think that might be.

> P2: because I would know that a lot of other people have gone down this route, and the program is doing the best it can to help me, even if it can't get the answers.

Tyler: That's fair. Okay. So it kind of feels like, it's frustrating when it's suggesting to you the wrong option, like I could see that through the whole process, like when you when it said disability, compensation. And you're like, no, it's not that that's frustrating, but maybe it's a little less frustrating. If you know it's trying to like, use other Veterans questions. And if other Veterans have asked about this, and it was about disability compensation, maybe I'm in the right.

Tyler: Go ahead right way.

> P2: Yes.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense.

Tyler: awesome. I think you've answered all of my questions. Do you have any questions for me? At this point.

> P2: No.

Tyler: Okay, cool.

Tyler: Well, thanks so much for sharing your time with us. It's really useful. You gave us a lot of things to think about. We're trying to figure out ways that we can make this process particularly the beginning of filling out this form a little bit easier. And so we showed you some different ideas that we're considering, and you gave us really good feedback.

Tyler: So I think that's all for me. We can finish a little bit early, and I hope you take part in research with the Va. In the future. They're going to send you a little note after we finish, and it's going to like, say, thank you for your time, and you can. There's going to share information that you can pass on to other Veterans if they want to take part in research in the future. And if you have any other questions you can let Shannon know. But yeah, that's it for me.

> P2: Thank you.

Tyler: Thank you, [P2]. Have a good day.

> P2: Thank you, you too.

Tyler: Bye.

> P2: Bye.
