Tyler: Alright. So the recording started, I just want to confirm are you comfortable? If I record my screen and audio today.

> P10: Sure. Yes.

Tyler: Okay. Awesome.

> P10: Cool.

Tyler: Cool. Well, do you have any questions for me? At this point.

> P10: No, no, not right now. We might, I mean as we get through this. But I'm okay right now.

Tyler: Sounds good. Well, feel free to ask at any point. So before we start looking at some of those prototypes I mentioned, I would just like to learn a little bit more about you and your experience with the VA. How long have you been a veteran?

> P10: Boy, since 1964. For quite a while.

Tyler: Yeah, a couple of years. 

> P10: Yeah.

Tyler: Did you start interacting with the Va back in 64 or

> P10: Started probably around 1969, 1970. I started interacting with the Va. You know.

Tyler: Okay.

> P10: One of the 1st visits I had to a Va. Center was, you know, we get a flu shot. I think that was probably late 69 early 70.

Tyler: Okay, nice. And what about these days? How do you interact with the Va these days?

> P10: Okay, I have a primary care provider with the local Va here.

> P10: And, matter of fact, I've had several over there. We now live in [state]. We've been here about 18 years now.

> P10: and I've had, like 4 different primary care providers. They've all been great. Most of them has moved on to like different things. Better things, I guess.

> P10: But they're all. They're all very good. And they, you know, again I go in for my annual physical. They find something blood work, or whatever, and we continue to work on. You know what needs to be fixed.

> P10: So, and they're very good at scheduling and very good at, you know. being able to refer me to the appropriate doctor. So I haven't had any. No complaints in that area. No.

Tyler: That's awesome. That's really good to hear. So you're interacting with the view mostly related to your healthcare. Is that right?

> P10: Yeah, oh, yeah, 90%.

Tyler: And when you're when you're talking to your healthcare providers, how do you usually get in touch with them?

> P10: Well, if it's if it's not an in person visit, usually messaging.

Tyler: Okay.

> P10: That's probably my best way to get in touch with them.

Tyler: Okay. So you're using like, my healthy vet, secure messaging. How do you find the messaging to work.

> P10: Good. It's, it works fine. I don't. I didn't have any problems with it. I've there are times that they asked for an attachment. I'm easily able to add that attachment and send it on on to them.

> P10: I haven't had no, haven't had any problem with the system itself, you know. So it takes a little while for them to respond back, because it usually goes to an [secretary], or someone who, you know, filters it before it gets to the doctor, and I know that that's you know, it's a process that has to happen so. But as far as actually getting in touch with them. It's usually not a problem at all.

Tyler: Okay, awesome. That's great to hear. What if you need to contact the Va about something that's not related to your healthcare? Do you know where you would start.

> P10: No, not really. I mean I there are. There's 2 newsletters that I subscribe to that are Va newsletters. And lots of times there'll be helpful hints out there. Exercise routines or things like that. Or, you know, did you know you can get glasses whatever. And I usually click on the link and see what it's. See what it's all about. And then, if I need to do something, I usually pursue it through that link.

Tyler: Okay.

> P10: You know, I'll say like, How do I get in touch with? And they'll say, either go to your local Va Clinic if it's medical reason. If it's not, you can click here. Ask a question.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense. Yeah, that's really helpful. So the newsletter can be sometimes an inroad to get in touch with the Va.

> P10: Exactly, exactly. Plus, you know it. Triggers things that you don't normally think about. We say, well, you know maybe I'll let that go. But then you look at it, and you say, well, maybe I'll just click on that link and see what that see what that, what activity would do for me.

Tyler: That's good. Have you ever contacted the Va using like an online form.

> P10: No.

Tyler: Okay. And have you heard of something called Ask Va.

> P10: No.

Tyler: Okay?

Tyler: And then what about the Va Chatbot? Have you ever used or heard of the Va Chatbot?

> P10: I have, and I haven't used it.

Tyler: Okay, cool.

Tyler: perfect. Well, when we think about your past experiences contacting the Va. And and the future experiences that you want to have, what do you think is the most important thing to you when it comes to having a good experience.

> P10: I think to get, you know, get feedback in some reasonable amount of time, even if they're still working on the situation. If it's something that's gonna take like more than 48 h to resolve.

> P10: It'd be nice if you, if they were able to do that.

> P10: In particular. I'll give you one example.

> P10: I have a sleep apnea, and so they've tried a couple of different devices on me, and the one that works the best is one of the newest ones that the Va. Is using. It's also one of the most reasonable ones. But unfortunately, the company is in the Uk.

> P10: So it requires that you get these certain supplies at a certain level. Otherwise the machine turns off. And I'm never able to get the supplies. I call the Sleep Clinic, and they shoot their very, very good. They immediately order it.

> P10: They had, you know we put another order in, and we see that you ordered it 3 months ago. You don't have it. You ordered it the month before. You don't have it. You're ordering it today. You still don't have it. So there's no other connection. Now I know when they place the order probably goes to some purchasing department, or maybe prosthetics, or somewhere within the Va. But then it just goes dead, and maybe 3 or 4 months later it shows up at the door, or maybe the other one, like, I say, my most recent one is that it's going bad on me.

> P10: And so I had a a technical person over in the Uk actually reset it remotely. So they get another 60 days out of it. Until my new part comes in, but we don't know where the new part is.

Tyler: Okay.

> P10: Yeah. So that would be more of the follow up. But I think it's more of the internal workings of you know what's going on, and how many people of papers being shuffled through, and you know, is there additional signatures needed? And it just from coming from the corporate world. It just seems very simple, and you could just execute an order, and you could follow where it is.

> P10: But it doesn't happen that way, and I don't think it's the Va's fault. It's just. It's such a huge organization. I just think I don't think it happens that way.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P10: So in my case would be when I do something like that, and I get a response back within a reasonable time, even if it's only 2 or 3 days. It's gone by that basically some little AI routine says, Hey, we're still looking at this and haven't processed it yet, you know, keeps them back in mind. So you know, as a human, you say. Oh, it's moving through. And some little AI routine actually gave you the message. But it makes you feel good.

Tyler: Yeah, totally. So it's not just about the timeliness of like the resolution, let's say, like receiving the part. It's also like, having updates and not feeling like you're in the dark during the process.

> P10: Exactly.

Tyler: Yeah, that's really helpful in that example.

Tyler: I want to ask you some other questions about something different which you actually just started to touch on. But we're gonna talk a little bit about automation today. And automation can be quite a general term. But I'm talking about when a computer is doing something that usually a human would do manually right? So it could be like a helper summarizing an article or giving you a recommendation, or you even just mentioned, like, maybe they're giving you an update as to what's happening behind the scenes.

Tyler: do you know if you use tools that use some sort of automation like this.

> P10: Oh yes!

> P10: I've used. I've used those tools quite a bit and use them quite a bit. Some are extremely effective and some are absolutely pathetic. It's like the bigger the organization, the more pathetic. Yeah, just, you know, unbelievable. I don't want to give you specifics of the organization, but It's a telecommunications company.

Tyler: Hmm.

> P10: And I had a situation where a credit was supposed to be posted monthly on a basis for the next 24 months, and never. So now we're 6 months into the contracts, never been posted.

Tyler: Hmm.

> P10: You have to deal with this AI bot to get an answer. and so you ask it, you know where is the credit, and then you give it a case number that you have, because I always ask case number, and then and it comes back and it says, Click, this link, and you'll get the status. And so you click the link. And it says we're working on your problem.

> P10: And then it comes back. And then so and then recently, I got one that said, We're sorry. It's taken more than 2 weeks to solve the problem. We promise it will be done in 2 weeks. It'll be done within the next few days.

> P10: Well, right now is 11 days, and I still don't have a response, because I can't talk to a human. It won't let me get through it, won't you know I didn't say what's you know? What's your corporate number for? For satisfaction? You know where, what and it does, don't under doesn't understand.

> P10: Because obviously the programmers are not going to supply that. They're probably told by their managers don't supply the corporate number.

> P10: So if it worked and I have, I have situations where it's worked very. It's worked well with airline reservations. It worked fantastic. I can change seats, change flights, do anything at all in my tickets, updated instantly. And I never deal with a human because it's even worse when you call an airline. You know you're on hold for like days.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P10: So sometimes it works well, and sometimes it. It doesn't work.

Tyler: Yeah, those both of those examples are really useful, like in the case of it, working. Well.

Tyler: it's doing what you need it to do without you ever having to like escalate to talking to somebody. And then, in the case where it's not working well, it feels like.

Tyler: and you know, there might be other reasons why it's also frustrating. But one part of the frustration is that you're never able to escalate and talk to somebody. If the bot can't do what it needs you to do. Right? Yeah.

> P10: And I'm from the I'm not. My kids and grandkids obviously are all from the generation of you know. We rather do it on the phone via text. The way I like to interact. I absolutely love to interact, you know, in person.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P10: But I've gotten so used to using those routines. Now that I'm okay with them. But when the level of frustration goes up, and I really want a person, not, it's really worse for me, you know.

Tyler: Yeah. Totally.

> P10: I'm sure my kids or grandkids would have no problem with never talking to anybody in person again.

Tyler: Yeah, everyone has different expectations.

Tyler: Yeah, well, that's really helpful. I think we're going to talk more about some of these like feelings and when we yeah, like, how we feel about automation in the tool today.

Tyler: So what we're gonna do next is we're gonna get set up with one of these prototypes? So the 1st thing I'm gonna have you do is share your screen on your ipad. Do you know if you've ever shared your screen on the iPad before.

> P10: I might have. I don't know if I ever did. I can't. I gotta be honest. I know.

Tyler: Yeah, that's totally fine. So I'm gonna help kind of walk you through how we do that.

Tyler: And you're looking right now at zoom, and you can see my face there. Right? Okay, so you might need to click just anywhere in the middle of the screen. And then some controls might show up at the bottom.

> P10: Do it now.

Tyler: Yeah, go ahead and click on the middle of the screen. And do you see anything? Show up at the bottom.

> P10: Oh, a whole bunch of them.

Tyler: Okay. So if they go away while we're talking, you can just click in the middle of the screen again. But we're gonna look for one that says share, and it has an arrow, and it's usually green.

> P10: Well, they're not the only one.

> P10: The only one that's in color is one that says Leave, and I don't want to hit that one.

Tyler: Yeah, that's not.

> P10: Got arrow right top.

Tyler: Perfect yeah. Tap on that one.

> P10: Missed it.

Tyler: And then it.

> P10: Okay.

Tyler: Let me know what it says. Now.

> P10: It says, screen photos, icloud drive web, URL and web.

Tyler: So let's click on screen.

> P10: Screen.

Tyler: And then it's probably gonna ask you to start a broadcast. Does it say something like that?

> P10: It says, screen broadcast. The current one is checked is zoom, and then bottom. One is. Start broadcast.

Tyler: Okay, perfect. So let's click on, start broadcast.

> P10: Okay.

Tyler: And then I'll let you know.

Tyler: when I start seeing your screen. Okay, perfect. So now I can see your screen. So I can see the same thing you can see. And then you're just gonna need to click in any of that black space just to get out of this like little pop up. So if you click, yeah, perfect. Okay.

Tyler: awesome.

Tyler: So I'm seeing your screen. It says you are sharing screen and.

Tyler: The 1st thing we're gonna do is I'm gonna have you open up this prototype. So I sent I just sent a link to you. And it's popped up on your screen. And you see these controls that we just looked at.

> P10: Nope.

Tyler: They've disappeared again, so we'll click in the middle of the screen anywhere.

> P10: You were.

Tyler: And then at the bottom, where it says Chat, there's a little one symbol.

> P10: I see it. Let me click on. Oops went away.

> P10: Yes, perfect. Yeah. Click on that one. Yeah, there you go, awesome.

> P10: I get real small print, so I just put my glasses on, made a little easier to read the.

Tyler: Yes, good call alright. Let's click on that link there. Okay.

> P10: Right hand corner. Okay? I still see you.

Tyler: Yeah, there we go.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So it's loading. We'll give it a minute to load.

Tyler: And I'm gonna tell you a little bit about what we're gonna be doing today. So

Tyler: it. And it looks like a little phone so we're pretending like you're on your phone.

> P10: This thing says, I've got a pop up here that says, use your Google account to sign into figma.

Tyler: Yeah, you don't actually have to do that. So if you move my face, if you like, put your finger on my face and move it to the left. You can X, that box out.

> P10: Okay. Good.

Tyler: Perfect.

> P10: Okay.

### Concept C

Tyler: All right. Okay, so we are going to look at this website together. I'm going to tell you a little bit about it. So we're pretending like we're on va.gov, and this is a tool called Ask Va and ask, Va is a form that you can use to ask the Va a question. So you can ask questions about education, disability, compensation, healthcare, a lot of different topics.

> P10: Okay.

Tyler: And what happens is you fill out a form and it gets sent to the Va. And then they get back to you with the response.

Tyler: And I'm gonna show you 3 different concepts today, or 3 different prototypes. And all 3 of these concepts. You're gonna be asking the va, the same question.

Tyler: So some of them, some aspects of all 3 concepts is going to feel really similar. But then there's going to be some slight differences. And we're going to talk about those together.

Tyler: Does all of this sound. Okay.

> P10: Yes, yeah. You think you're not looking for any comments on this. Now, we're just gonna talk through it right.

Tyler: We're gonna talk through it. And yeah, yeah, we're gonna I'll ask you some questions. But if there's anything that jumps out at you that you want to share with me. You're always welcome to do that.

> P10: You know the 1st thing is on this one screen. It says you should reply. Within 7 business days.

> P10: If that was me, I would say, you will.

> P10: I would take somehow this should means, is it worth my while filling all this out when I could get a response with 7 days, or maybe I won't, because that's what happens today.

> P10: Today. I don't. You know, it's like your data will be posted within 36 h of your appointment. It's not.

> P10: So I just, but that's okay. That's just a...

Tyler: No, that's good. That's a really good thing to notice. So.

> P10: I mean, it should. It's a nice cover, because you can say what.

Tyler: Yeah, for sure, but I can see how that also makes you think well, will I? Is it worth it?

> P10: Right, is it worth? Should I pick up the phone and dial the Va instead? You know.

Tyler: Yeah, definitely. That makes sense.

Tyler: let's scroll down a little bit on this page, so you'll just use your finger just like as if you were using your phone. On that phone screen.

> P10: Oh, oh, that's kind of neat.

Tyler: Yeah, and not everything's gonna be clickable. So I'll help kind of guide us.

Tyler: but feel free to scroll down and or scroll around and look around.

> P10: Do I? You want me to click on any of these.

Tyler: We're not gonna click on anything yet, but.

> P10: Okay.

Tyler: Know if anything kind of jumps out at you.

> P10: No, it's pretty pretty clear forward, and I think the

> P10: I mean the categories [footer[ are great. I don't see anything. I don't. Yeah, that's fine.

Tyler: Okay, awesome. That's good. Let's scroll up a little bit.

> P10: Up a little bit.

Tyler: Yeah, and we'll just talk. Oh, sorry. So up on the page. But that will actually probably be scrolling down.

> P10: Oh!

Tyler: Yeah, perfect. Okay, so we're back here and what? What would? What's the purpose of this page? What would you do on this page?

> P10: What I do on this page.

> P10: I guess I would ask a question. If I have a some issue with the Va. I would just

> P10: I would just put it in there.

Tyler: Okay, perfect. So that makes sense. We can't actually type in this prototype today. But what we can do is pretend like you've typed. So if you click in the middle of that question box where you would be writing your question.

Tyler: okay.

Tyler: say, this is your question today. So it says, I know it's pretty small. It says, what resources are available.

> P10: Okay, yeah, all right. Yeah, we'll do it.

Tyler: Got him? Okay.

> P10: I have to read when my cheaters [glasses] on. Actually I can.

> P10: It's better this way.

Tyler: Awesome. So we're asking a question to the Va. About mobility or assistive devices right.

> P10: Right.

Tyler: And for the whole session. That's what we're pretending like we're asking about. So.

Tyler: When you've asked your question, or you've typed in your question, can you show me what you would do next?

> P10: What I would do.

> P10: Yeah, I would hit the continue.

Tyler: Okay, let's do that.

> P10: Okay.

Tyler: Okay. And then tell me about this page.

> P10: Okay, let's see.

> P10: Okay, great, can I? Can. I see which on the dropdown.

Tyler: You can. Yeah.

> P10: Does that work.

Tyler: Yes, scrolling can be a little funny with this prototype once you open the menu. But what is this? The list of.

> P10: See a whole bunch of you know, resources that are available.

> P10: categories of resources that are available looks like.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: And so why is it asking you to choose a category.

> P10: Why is it asking me to choose a category. Probably because it's not intelligent enough to grasp it from the question.

> P10: So if my question was, let's stay with the disability.

> P10: Are grab bars available for bathtubs.

> P10: Okay, if I ask that question.

> P10: and it was in an AI type situation, it would just parse that out and say, Oh, I know what he's looking for. Yes, we have various ones available, or, you know, click here for further information, or whatever, because this is asking me for categories.

> P10: right? Which means it could be anywhere. I could be asking a question about education. What educational benefits do I have.

> P10: Okay, how do I go for an increase in my disability? And I can go to A to Z

> P10: finding a category and trying to pick it.

> P10: or I could just ask a question and have it parse out.

> P10: You know, if it has enough information, if I've given it enough data.

> P10: the other thing is sometimes when you get into these categories, not just the anywhere. Okay.

> P10: Sometimes when you click on something, you think that that is gonna give you gonna put you in the area of what you wanted to see what you wanted to know about.

> P10: But it didn't. In other words, it may get you out into a like

> P10: I guess I don't really have a let's say I clicked on disability compensation.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P10: Okay.

> P10: there might be a sub screen that says, if you're on disability, you consider you'd want to know something about your current disability. Do you want to know how you could increase your disability? You want to know, if you have 2 different disabilities, how they concatenate them together for the benefit. There's a whole host of things behind just that. But if I was to click on that, and it only gave me 2 or 3 areas and didn't give me all the things that deal with disability.

> P10: Like if I wanted to check. I'm making all this stuff up.

> P10: Had to challenge a claim. If I wanted to open a new claim it didn't have that stuff. It just said, Oh, your last payment is this, it was done on this day.

> P10: Then I then it would force me to go back into this again

> P10: to try to find out where.

> P10: And that's okay. Okay. But if there was a way for you to for me to enter something

> P10: again and have it parsed that conversation and say, Oh, I think I know where he's gonna go.

> P10: It still may be. Send me out to a place that I need to come back from.

> P10: But given the choices sometimes it's difficult.

Tyler: For me. It's not. I'm pretty analytical. So for me, it's not too difficult for me to interact with you, because I could pick what I wanted here, it would get me to where I wanted to go.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P10: But some people might not be able to. They might say, well, I'll click housing because a disability and you're gonna cover me for my, and it doesn't. You know, there's okay. And they're looking at something different.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P10: Oh no!

Tyler: Sure.

> P10: Yeah, I mean, it's definitely usable. It's just my own.

Tyler: Yeah, it's really helpful.

Tyler: So you're kind of like pointing out an opportunity here for something to be

Tyler: automated a little bit right where it could.

Tyler: Based on your question. We think you're. It's about this, and it will send you down a path. Is that right?

> P10: Right, and give you another 3 or 4 categories to look at, because it hasn't figured out exactly what you're trying to say, but it knows it knows this has nothing to do with housing.

> P10: The question has nothing to do with your health condition. It knows what. So in other words, it gets you in an area. It gets you off of where it says healthcare.

Tyler: Right, yeah.

> P10: If I had a disability I might click healthcare to see what my disability is to see what my co-payments are. But maybe it doesn't fall under health care. Health care would be my appointments, you know. Scheduling medications. I'm on.

> P10: Okay, but I click healthcare, because I say, Oh, well, I want to see what my co-payment is for that particular drug.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P10: But if but if I could, if I could type it in, it's I could say

> P10: interested in what the co-payments are for whatever.

> P10: Then it might send me to

> P10: the AI. Might send me to another, but it would to another screen, but it would be more concise. Then we say, Okay, now you're here.

Tyler: Okay.

> P10: I know about health, Copay. Did you want to know in hospital? Do you want to know drugs? Do you want to know.

Tyler: Right? Narrowing it down. And yeah, yeah, civic, yeah.

Tyler: that makes a lot of sense,

Tyler: i'm sure, none of this is easy to do. These things are very complicated.

Tyler: Yeah, it's much more complicated than one would think. But I think what you're pointing to is really relevant for what we're gonna talk about through the rest of the session, too. So it's really really helpful to hear your description of it all, and how you imagine it working better.

Tyler: Let's like close this menu so that we can see the rest of the page. So you can click on like you can click on healthcare. Or you could even just click like outside of this. Yeah, that works perfect. And tell me about the rest of this page. What else is on the page.

> P10: Yeah. Now, you know, this is really good. That's yeah. This is fine. You see, when it gets you. Yeah, okay.

> P10: Good. Yeah.

Tyler: So.

> P10: That's

> P10: that's a little bit about what I was talking about from that front screen. That's it. Yeah, that's it.

> P10: That's exactly now. And now it forces me to take a look and say, Okay, I know I clicked on that. But what do I? What do I really want to see here?

Tyler: Hmm.

> P10: Yeah, that's no, no, this is fine.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense. So it feels like,

Tyler: it's a little bit how you were describing like you start at this bigger category and.

> P10: Anyways.

Tyler: Narrowing it down, and then it's up to you to make decisions on like which of these best.

> P10: Exactly.

Tyler: Fits, what you're talking about.

Tyler: Okay.

> P10: See in my case, I would immediately click on order medical supplies and find out where my CPAP replacement thing is.

Tyler: Yeah, yeah, and there's a little bit of a in there.

> P10: You know it's what a purchasing 80 agent in Nevada, or whatever.

Tyler: That's really helpful. So is there a difference between like if we go up a little bit where we chose healthcare? So we chose healthcare here. Did that determine what was shown below these links below.

> P10: Yeah, it's 1 pm, right?

> P10: Yeah, yeah, that's exactly what. Yes.

Tyler: Gotcha nice. And then if we were, we're not gonna actually click on one of the links today. But if we were gonna click on one of these links like, let's say, we were gonna click order medical supplies. What do you think? What do you think would happen when we click that.

> P10: I I think somehow it would. It would take it, would look at my profile and know what supplies that I've ordered before.

> P10: It, it would know I'm qualified for it that I can't just order something.

> P10: And it would say, Okay, you have this type of sleep apnea machine. So you can order these accessories.

Tyler: Okay.

> P10: Because I used to have the regular size one and and I would do it on. I do it on paper for the logistics center. But it would. It would say, Okay, you can get a hose. You can get a mass, you can get whatever. And then, depending on the model I had, it would only let me get those parts. So that's what I would expect. What I would suspect expect is that you click it there. Let's say, a person had

> P10: in addition to that, have hearing aids, and I know there's all kinds of them. Well, there's probably dog kinds of accessories that go with hearing aids, so I assume they would click there. And it would say, Okay, I know that here's his profile. He has this hearing aid, and so he needs these batteries. This, whatever cleaner?

> P10: Yeah, I think that would.

> P10: But if you went there it would have to tell you.

> P10: When you got there, it would have to say, you can order these things.

> P10: You know what I'm saying, because you I wouldn't know the part number or what to order you've got, you know, same.

> P10: And then I'm sure I'm sure there are things that you could say order, medical supplies.

> P10: and there's things that a person might have that he can't just go and order.

> P10: Let's say, like you did adaptive. Let's say somebody's got a scooter, and he wants to wear a second one.

> P10: Sure, it's not gonna show. You know what I'm saying.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P10: There are things that veterans have over the years that the Va. Has given them, for whatever reasons.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P10: So, you know, if it's a if it's a expendable part, then you can order it. If it's not, I would imagine you have to go back through the Va. And say, Do I qualify? You know.

> P10: Took my scooter over, and I need a new one, or what.

Tyler: Right? Yeah, okay, that's helpful. So it seems like you're expecting like to do a task essentially like when you click on a link. You're hoping that you're gonna go and be able to complete that whatever task it might be, and that it will know a little bit about you. In some ways, it'll know, like you qualify for this. You can order this. That. That's that makes a lot of sense.

Tyler: okay, awesome. I think we can pause on this prototype, and we'll start looking at the next one. And so what we're going to do is we are going to navigate back to zoom on your ipad. So if you click on my face

Tyler: usually this will take us back to zoom. Yeah, perfect. Okay, and we've still got the chat open. So with that chat open, I'm just gonna send you another link in the chat.

### Concept A

Tyler: So I just sent you another link. You got that one.

> P10: Yup, so do that one. Now.

Tyler: Yes, please, yeah, you can click on that that second link at the bottom. Perfect.

Tyler: Alright, and we'll give this one a minute to load. But this is gonna feel really similar as we're gonna look at this tool, and we're gonna go through the same process and talk about it. So the beginning of this process is really similar to before right.

> P10: Okay.

Tyler: We're asking the Va. A question.

Tyler: I think maybe it's a little bit smaller. So if you see how there's a this bar at the bottom of your screen, and it says, Opt out, or there's an X.

> P10: Yes.

Tyler: If you click that X.

> P10: Perfect balance a little bit.

> P10: There you go! There you go. Yep.

Tyler: Nice. So on this screen, this is where we're gonna type in our question. Right? We talked about this before.

Tyler: Okay, so let's click on that question box.

Tyler: And then we have the same question for the Va. We're asking about mobility or assistive devices, and you showed me before how to continue.

Tyler: we can do that again.

> P10: Okay.

Tyler: And tell me about this page. What are we seeing now?

> P10: So the first, the prior screen to this

> P10: the question was it asked for assistive devices?

> P10: Did it say anything about disability, compensation? I don't remember it saying anything about disability, compensation.

Tyler: That's right. It didn't mention disability, compensation.

> P10: Do not. So now we're at a screen.

> P10: That says your question is related to this category, which it is. Let's say I needed a scooter.

> P10: Okay, you can edit this if it's different. And it says disability, compensation. And there's an edit.

> P10: What does that have to do with

> P10: to I? Compensation to me means the financial part of it. The money.

> P10: Right, or maybe the level that you're maybe you're. I don't know 10% to 100, whatever it goes.

> P10: Disabled.

> P10: I... this one's aggravating me because it gives me it gives me to something that I didn't if I clicked on that. That was my question. What I needed to see is what's available to me

> P10: again when I click there it knows my profile. It knows. If I have a disability, it knows the percentage of my disability, it knows what products I would qualify or could qualify for.

> P10: And knows the ones that I don't qualify for or out of pocket.

> P10: So, to give me this question at this point, what happens if I click edit.

> P10: does it give me to a better screen? That says.

Tyler: Yeah, let's click on edit and see what happens.

> P10: Okay.

Tyler: I can understand why this is feeling aggravating so far. So you can go ahead and open that menu. If you want to see the options.

> P10: Did.

> P10: No, this is yeah. Again, this, this is more confusing. The prior one was the prior prototype to me was easier. This gets another step that doesn't get you any. That doesn't. It takes longer to get your answer here, or at least to get to where you think you want the answer to be. And it does on the 1st one.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P10: It's a little, it's to me, it's misleading, it's you're asking me a question. And then, when I answer the question that says, yes, that's what I'm looking for. It immediately puts me onto this disability screen. I have the same categories that I have here.

> P10: Here I can pick.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: So it felt like you had to basically like, do an extra step to get to where you were. Yeah, yeah.

Tyler: yeah, that makes sense.

> P10: Now if I hadn't seen the 1st prototype. I might have been okay with it, I still would have had a question is, why does it want me to? Why does it have? Why does it say edit? You know, when I don't, I don't even have disability compensation. I was just wondering what.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P10: Oh, yeah.

Tyler: Yeah, for sure. It's a little bit confusing. Why, it's asking you to.

Tyler: Disability, compensation. It makes sense to me.

Tyler: So let's talk about this a little bit more.

Tyler: I can see how it definitely feels like. It's an extra step to get back to where you were on the last. When we were in the last prototype. We got back to this list of options right? But before you just went straight into that list of options.

> P10: Right.

Tyler: So here the Va. Has made a suggestion like it's saying, we think that your category is related to disability compensation. And it seems like it's gotten the suggestion wrong is all that clear.

> P10: Yes.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: Is it helpful that it tried to make a suggestion, or is it unhelpful because it was wrong?

> P10: to me, it's not helpful. No. Because it was, I would. I would have rather seen. As I say, I would rather have seen me put the question in, and then it takes a look at what the pieces of the question are.

> P10: But yeah, it kind of gives you. It gives you a step that you really don't need.

> P10: And remember now, most of the people using this is probably in their sixties, seventies, eighties, nineties. Okay. And we're just a different generation. And.

> P10: That's it. It's like, just, we'll just cut to the chase. Really good. the device or not giving the device, you know.

> P10: Yeah, totally.

Tyler: Do you think it's better for you to just make the choice like, if we need in the end we need you to. We need a category. We need to know the category of your question. Is it better if you just choose the category rather than the computer tries to choose it for you?

> P10: Yeah, yes, it would be better in. Yes, at this particular juncture would be better now. Once

> P10: once a the AI or whatever that you're trying to create, gets perfected.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P10: It would be far better just to ask the question.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P10: Okay, it'd be far better to ask the question and have it figure out what you really want to do. And you know and put it in there. So you know.

> P10: it's like it's like I, you know, I get one of my grandkids uses it for cliff notes so he doesn't even have jeez. I didn't get through college with that. AI writes one for me. Okay, that's not what I really want. I don't want to have the system do that.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P10: Again. I don't know what the objective is. I don't know what Va has said that they want to have for standards, and how the systems. People are trying to dissect that.

> P10: Figure out what they want to do with it.

> P10: The system that you have now is a pretty good system. It works pretty well.

> P10: Okay, there is some limitations that there are some screens that still get hung up. There's some performance issues. That that I mean, I. I have half a gig here, so it's this thing should be fly we are not. This thing should be.

> P10: I can get on, and that little wheel just spins and spins and spins. So there. There are some issues with the existing system.

> P10: And then there are some issues when I'm trying a new system where everything is cluttered like in one area.

> P10: Click here for disability, click here for medical click here for your lab results.

Tyler: Hmm.

> P10: So this is probably gonna be better. But I don't know.

> P10: I don't know yet how much better it's gonna be until I actually, you know. See it? I don't wanna be critical of the system. It doesn't.

Tyler: Well, it's yeah.

> P10: But

> P10: But even in the existing system there are things that

> P10: you know, could be a little bit better.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P10: Like. For instance, let's just say I've gotten a MRI With the Va.

> P10: And I have an outside doctor that wants to give me a second opinion on that.

Tyler: You know.

> P10: And hit that download link to try to get that MRI out to a disk around. Pd, don't ever try it. I have to go and get a hard copy. I have to drive down there and get a hard copy. They got a feature that's out there that doesn't work, you know. And that's just one little tiny thing.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P10: Happens to me once a year, but people that are getting those things and want to send them to a doctor, or maybe that are an hour away from their Va.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P10: Clinic. You know I'm 45 min away. 45 min. Nothing for me, you know.

> P10: but if we stay with this I prefer the other prototype.

Tyler: Yeah, for sure, I can completely see that, like, I think,

Tyler: Get the sense that like, if it was able to make a really good recommendation and almost like, just never get it wrong. Then you'd be okay with it. But if not, it's probably faster for you to make the choice yourself. And that that's really helpful feedback.

Tyler: okay, let's click on this menu.

Tyler: and we're gonna say that your question is about health care.

> P10: Okay.

Tyler: And then we'll just save that.

> P10: Save. Okay.

Tyler: Okay. And so now, what's happened? Now.

> P10: Okay.

> P10: So now, when it says, you can edit this and I hit the edit, it actually means I can change categories. That's what that's what edit means. Here.

Tyler: It is what it means, but I can see how that wasn't clear at first.

> P10: So it's not like I can change my date of birth. That's Right.

> P10: Yeah. changing. My selection doesn't allow me to edit it, because I can't get in here and retype my own camera edit. It.

Tyler: That's true.

> P10: Select another category.

> P10: Yes, yeah, that's so true. Yeah.

> P10: And the thing, of course, related to this category, you can change the category if it's different than the one that you see something.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: yeah, that's a great point. Because I remember you talking when it said disability, compensation. Oh, can I change this? And my disability, compensation file, etcetera. So I can see how edit is confusing as the language. Yeah.

> P10: That's okay. Sorry.

Tyler: No, it's okay. This is why we're here. This is really great feedback. let's click on. Continue, because I'm curious what you think about what happens after this.

Tyler: What is on this page? Now.

> P10: This is a okay. So my category was healthcare.

> P10: Right?

Tyler: Yeah.

> P10: I didn't edit it. I said, healthcare, okay.

> P10: And then it says, we think your topic is related. We think your question related to assignment. So it's prosthetics.

> P10: Okay.

> P10: Well.

Tyler: Then again, I got the edit again. But that's okay.

> P10: I'm gonna see what happens when I click that in a minute. But prosthetics is

> P10: related to healthcare. But my definition of healthcare is

> P10: my back is killing me, and I gotta see the doctor, or my heart rate is elevated percent. Me is more like adaptive devices.

> P10: Whether it's an artificial leg, an arm, or whatever. So how health got me to prosthetics I don't know.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P10: I'd like to see here is now when I click edit, maybe I'll see it. What are my current prescriptions?

> P10: Can I increase the dose whatever. So this is kind of

> P10: oh, no, I just get it back. I can't edit it.

Tyler: Yeah, that's yeah. Well, the last page, yeah. But I guess.

> P10: Might hold on this call.

Tyler: No problem.

> P10: Thanks. Sorry.

Tyler: No worries at all. I get what you mean, though. So it's a little bit confusing how it made the jump from healthcare into prosthetics, and.

> P10: Yeah, why didn't healthcare give me like your provider is, or you're in Pack Number 17 or.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P10: 6.

> P10: It helps.

Tyler: Yeah, I'm sure.

> P10: It is like, do you want to order batteries for your hearing aid? Or you know, anyway, I don't know.

Tyler: That makes sense.

> P10: I don't know why it made that. I don't know. I don't know why it got me there.

Tyler: Yeah, I can see how that jump is confusing. So this is a little confusing, because it's a hypothetical situation. But we're pretending, like your question that you originally were asking was, what resources are available for veterans who need support with mobility or assistive devices? Do you think that that relates to prosthetics or not.

Tyler: Exactly, really. Okay.

> P10: Absolutely absolutely.

> P10: You see, they added, the question was great, and then they added the healthcare and there was the question was perfect. It just sent me directly to. Prosthetics. Yeah, which is exactly where I should be.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P10: I shouldn't be where it said. You're in healthcare, because I'm not looking for aspirins, or whatever.

> P10: I'm looking for. Yeah, I see.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

> P10: Got me directly to the screen. Perfect.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. That's that reminds me of when we looked at that 1st prototype because you were much more like happy to see those more specific links that we're talking about things that were like directly related to your question. Right? And that jump from like healthcare is a little confusing. I I totally see that.

### Concept B

Tyler: I see the time, and I do want you to have enough of a chance to look at the last prototype. So I think we'll switch to that. So if you click on my face.

Tyler: And I'm going to send you our last link.

Tyler: Okay, sent that one to you.

Tyler: Great, perfect. Now you're a pro.

> P10: Oh!

Tyler: Awesome, so.

> P10: Acb, a, BC, you want a CB, that's good.

Tyler: Yeah, I'm switching it up.

Tyler: Alright. So this should look pretty familiar. It looks like the size is a little funny on your screen.

> P10: Yeah, it's nice. It's big. I don't need.

Tyler: Bigger. Okay, cool.

> P10: Yeah, I can read this one. Really.

Tyler: Okay.

> P10: We're gonna ask the same question again. Just hit that.

Tyler: Yes, perfect.

> P10: Or do you populate it? I do it.

Tyler: You'll go ahead and do it. Yeah, that's perfect. And it's the same question, mobility or assistive devices. And then you can go ahead and continue when you're ready.

> P10: Can you.

Tyler: Okay, and tell me what we're seeing on this page. Now.

> P10: Oh, my, yeah, I see. My, my!

> P10: When I clicked on that my question was not about disability. Compensation relates to file a claim.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P10: My question was, what devices are available.

> P10: Okay cause. At this point it doesn't matter.

> P10: Later. Later I'll find out if I have to pay for it. If they pay for it.

Tyler: Yeah. So it's made the wrong.

> P10: Suggest, right in the beginning, you're saying, Yeah, no, no. This one's this one's really yeah, no.

> P10: this one doesn't work. If this is only me talking. Now you can talk to a lot of people, I'm sure. Only me just that. No, yeah.

Tyler: Yeah, no, for sure. But I will say that other people react similarly, when they see the disability compensation suggestion. And I will also let you know that we want to show what it would be like if it makes the wrong suggestion. So we know that disability compensation is probably not the right suggestion.

Tyler: And we also know that if we were gonna use some sort of automation to do this, it would get it wrong sometimes. So it's helpful to learn what happens when when we get it wrong. So I can see how it's. It's kind of immediately frustrating when the suggestion is wrong.

Tyler: Why do you think it made this suggestion disability, compensation? We've talked about this a little bit. But remind me why you think this might be? Why, they what they're suggesting, or how they're coming to this conclusion.

> P10: I don't. I don't.

Tyler: It's okay. If the answer is, I don't know.

> P10: again when I don't know how it got to this, for

> P10: if you're injured and you're in an accident.

> P10: and the ambulance comes to pick you up. The question is not, how much is it gonna cost me to have you transport me to the hospital so I can decide if I want to take my car, walk, or go in the ambulance.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P10: But this is asking me, saying I asked about disability, some equipment that I might need through prosthetics.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P10: 1st thing you're saying to me is.

> P10: we don't know if it's covered by Va. Yet. We don't know what the rates are. We don't know.

> P10: That's what it's told me. That's not what I meant. What I asked was.

> P10: can I get a new scooter when I click on that question, and it gets me down there and says, Listen, you've got to be 90% disabled to get a scooter from us. Well, I can understand that.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P10: Well, you've already stopped the process right here. What I might just need is just a grab bar for my bathtub or my shower or my toilet.

> P10: I made it $40 item, and not a thousand dollar item.

> P10: But now you've already asked me about, how does this relate to Va. Claim. How do you file a claim?

> P10: No, yeah.

> P10: Disability compensate? No. And then dude even people that are on disability.

> P10: I'm sure they get a check every month, or whatever. I don't think they care about that. At this point.

> P10: You know, that's what I get because of my disability.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P10: I have no idea how this got to this question.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P10: Now for me again.

> P10: When I see this question, I don't get aggravated with systems, people, or anything else. I say, now, I'm gonna pick up the phone, even if I'm on. Hold

> P10: where I'm gonna take that 45 min ride. And I'm gonna get to sit with an advocate who's gonna explain all this to me.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P10: Then I say, listen, I need this grab bar. Does it cover neck? Well, you gotta go back to your primary. They'll send you to Pt. Whatever whatever whatever. And then I got the process.

> P10: But it's it would take me longer to go through this and more frustrating, because it's gonna be 7 days for anybody gets back to me at minimum. You just send me just driving or picking up the phone.

Tyler: Yeah, definitely.

Tyler: I think that all makes a lot of sense. I can see how like if we make the wrong suggestion and we say something is about disability compensation, for example, it conjures up a lot of concerns about the whole process of like getting access to whatever support it might be that you're looking for. And so it's not just like, oh, you made a mistake. I'm frustrated. You chose the wrong category. It makes you actually wonder. Oh, am I not eligible for this thing? And and all these other questions? I think that is really useful. And this is why I love doing research.

Tyler: just triggered something with me just on your conversation, which is, did a fantastic job on that, and.

> P10: You just triggered on me that all of this information is in my file somewhere. All this information is that is accessible by anybody that's writing these systems not anywhere else in the world.

> P10: So you would automatically know if I have a disability, you would know the level of my disability. You would know what my compensation payments are if you need to know that stuff, and you would know what things I qualify for. Do I get eyeglasses for free, or do I pay a $50, Copay?

> P10: When I go?

> P10: I when I go into my primary care, is, that is, do I have to pay a copay to see my primary care? Or is that because of my level?

> P10: So the system has all that information in there about me.

> P10: All right. The disability knows what the disability it is.

> P10: It knows it's either PTSD. Or whatever they call that, or I have a broken arm, or I have burn pit, whatever whatever it knows

> P10: that information is in there, because I could get to that in my file. I can find out what I need to know about myself. It'll tell me when my disability started didn't start so on and so forth. So

> P10: when you ask when the person logs in you know who you are. And now now the system has to go and look.

> P10: Now, probably in the Va. It's in 15 different databases or a hundred different databases.

> P10: But somehow somebody needs to pull all that together.

> P10: because again, when I get into my health event, I can navigate from there I can go. I can check my disability. I can check the meds I'm on. I can do

> P10: this thing's, the way this system is written. Now it forces me to do the work that I know is already in there.

Tyler: Yeah, it's not leveraging enough of what it already knows about you.

> P10: Exactly.

Tyler: Yeah, that's frustrating.

> P10: There's a ton of information in here.

### Cool down

Tyler: Yeah, a hundred percent that makes a lot of sense. And I know we only have like 3 more minutes left. So we can kind of wrap up chatting. You can click on my face if you want to. We can just like chat for the last bit.

> P10: Okay.

Tyler: And then.

> P10: Got a thing it says sharing. Oh, here I am. Okay. There you go.

> P10: I got you. Oh, when it stops you.

Tyler: Yeah, you can stop share there and then, hopefully, it'll just make my face. Yeah.

> P10: Great.

Tyler: Okay.

> P10: You're probably never gonna call me again.

Tyler: No, you've done amazingly well. It's 1st of all, it's not very easy to share your screen on different devices, and we sent you 3 different links, which is not always what we do. So you did. Amazing.

> P10: Thank you.

Tyler: But yeah, I think our conversation was really meaningful to me. I picked up on a lot of things. I can see places where we were trying to show like making a recommendation. And it worked well, like when we made recommendations for certain links about automobile adaptive equipment. You were like, okay, this works. This is getting me more specific. This is where I want to end up. But when we made suggestions that were like, 1st of all.

Tyler: off the mark. But they were also, maybe, like too high level, like, we made the suggestion that your question was about disability compensation. It has you thinking, okay, well, does that mean you don't think I'm eligible? And all these other things? And so that's super useful, like takeaways

Tyler: for us. And I think what you're pointing to around us leveraging information that we already know about you is really important. It's something that right now ask. Va. Doesn't do a really good job of when you go to fill out your form. For example, you're contacting the Va, we'll pull in like your email address, we'll say, like, Oh, we know your email address, and we know your social security number. But we don't pull in other information. So it's not connected to like, if you do have disability compensation, that's not clear. And

Tyler: it requires the veteran to repeat themselves a lot. And we really want to move away from doing that. So you've given us some good things to think about in that regard as well.

> P10: Yeah, yeah, like, I said, just one little tiny thing like that where you could click on that. And it said, You know, the system would say, we've noticed that you don't qual that we. We've noticed that you currently do not have any Va disability. So if you want to pursue this kind of device we suggest, you come in, fill out this form, meet with so and so it stops the process right there.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P10: Or we understand that you have a 30% disability, and you may be covered for that device, and it makes you go on to the next to the next, you know. Question.

> P10: So.

Tyler: For sure. Yeah, that that's a really good suggestion. And I could see it working some like it, working like that kind of across the government. In the future.

Tyler: Do you have any questions for me? At this point.

> P10: No, no, you got you got your head. You got a great career. You got your hands full. There's a lot to do. And it's I'm sure there's teams and teams that are working on this stuff. And you know. yeah, yeah, there's a lot to do.

Tyler: Yeah, yeah, definitely. Yeah. Well, we appreciate your time very much. This is super helpful. And I hope

Tyler: I hope you can take part in research with the Va. Again in the future. If you have any questions, Shannon's going to reach out to you. She set up the research session, and you can ask her any questions, and otherwise I hope you have a lovely rest of the day.

> P10: Thank you. Thank you same to you, and it was a painless situation, so

Tyler: oh, good! I love to hear that.

> P10: Participate again, I'd be more than happy.

Tyler: Okay. Awesome. Well, thanks so much, [P10]. I'll see you later. Bye.
