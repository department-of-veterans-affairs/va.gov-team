# About this research

## Study
[2025-01 Ask VA: Automation concept testing #791](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/791)

## Background
Ask VA (AVA) lets Veterans, their family members and other submitters ask VA a question. In 2024, VA received over 500,000 questions through Ask VA. Ask VA includes a form, where submitters share their question with VA, and a dashboard, where submitters review past questions, read replies from VA and reply back.

After launching on VA.gov, we will focus on making quick, responsive improvements to the product while also bringing partners along on the journey. Our [product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/product/Product%20outline.md) includes more details about Ask VA and [Phase 2 initiatives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/product/Phase%202%3A%20Initiatives.md) describes our focus from January to March 2025.

## Research goals

* Understand how submitters expect to interact with and benefit from automation when asking VA a question online
* Understand whether providing recommendations using automation will make it easier to ask a question or receive help
