## Background

### Research goals
* Understand the information you need to see when you log into Ask VA

* 15 min - Activity 3: Business and Personal
* 10 min - Activity 4: Details of an inquiry
* 5 min - Closing & questions

### Materials
We used Mural for this workshop. You can view the activities and findings here: [9/14/23 Dashboard workshop with SCOs](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1694439082995/b37a804f76e3eae53b295792c422244fef6bda9f?wid=0-1694720743894).

## Insights

### What information helps you find an inquiry in your dashboard?
* Submitter question is the most useful field for sorting through inquiries because, "you often remember the question" or it includes identifying information like the student's name.
* It's also important to know the status and the date last updated because that's how you know what is new (and what might have a reply).
* Date submitted (and topic) might be more important for specific roles or topics, such as Work Study. But not for SCOs.
* Inquiry number is not often used to find an inquiry, "I don't use the inquiry number, or even keep it as a reference or anything."
* Category and topic are often the same, for example, 'Education' and 'Work study'. This makes these labels less useful when you sort through inquiries.
* **Takeaway:** This implies that inquiry number should not be the leading label, and we should re-think which labels should be shown at all.

#### More to less helpful dashboard labels

### How do you prefer to sort or filter for an inquiry?
* Having a search function which allows you to input free-text would be the most beneficial change to the dashboard.
* This is particularly true because SCOs would find it easiest to locate an inquiry using the submitter's question, which would require a search by free text.
* **Takeaway:** This implies a need for a search function.

#### Search example

### When do you check on an inquiry? How do you know when you receive a response?
* Emails help an SCO know when a status has changed, and triggers them to sign in and look at their dashboard.
* "I personally don't go in to Ask VA daily. I would only peek in if I'm looking for something specific or if it's been a while and I can't remember getting an email."
* **Takeaway:** This, along with other reasons, implies a need for a notification (in app) function.

### How should business or personal inquiries be distinguished?
* SCOs feel strongly that business and personal inquiries should not be mixed at all. Unfortunately, current credentialing makes it impossible to separate these completely, unless you sign in with a different account for each function, "I wish it could be separated at the login."
* We also learned that, "it defaults to personal" even if you aren't a Veteran or beneficiary, so some SCOs have business inquiries in their personal dashboard.
* **Takeaway:** This implies a need to rethink how we separate business and personal inquiries in the dashboard.
* **Takeaway:** We should sense check this challenge with the CRM team too.

### Do you need to view inquiries once they've been solved (and are complete)?
* Currently, business inquiries disappear after 60 days, "I have an issue with that."
* SCOs often refer back to past inquiries to see their inquiry and/or the response from VA. When they disappear, it's less efficient.
* When they disappear, it also means they lose documentation that they need, "It would be nice to have an archive where we can look at older, closed documents."
* SCOs also mention that they often need to print or at least get a PDF of a conversation once it's resolved, and "to print off a document is very cumbersome in the platform right now."
* **Takeaway:** This implies a need for an archive function.
* **Takeaway:** This implies that it needs to be easier to see a full paper trail of a conversation, and print it.

### What information do you need to see when you open an inquiry's details?
* When viewing an inquiry, the submitter question is what contextualizes the rest of the information on the page, "You have so many students, you might have multiple inquiries, so seeing what the question was [helps you track what you're doing."
* The response from the VA is what you're looking for, so it's important. And the date of the reply is helpful context and "keeps the sequence."
* If you repy to the VA, it's useful to the see the back and forth conversation. This should be easy to follow.
* Attachments might be more important for a work study supervisor.
* It's frustrating when their response is that you submitted under the wrong topic and you need to submit again, "Can't they switch that on their end?"
* It would be useful to always know who has replies from the VA, in case you need to cite their name or ID number in future conversations.
* Inquiry number is still not useful, in this context. "Inquiry number for me – I've really never looked at it." Similarly, "topic doesn't really mean much."
* **Takeaway:** This implies that inquiry number should not be the leading label, and we should re-think which labels should be shown at all.
* **Takeaway:** This implies that their should be less onus on the submitter to reroute an inquiry, if they choose the wrong category or topic. (This is out of scope right now.)

## Next steps

We have created or updated tickets in our sprint board based on our key takeaways. Next, we will prioritize which work is in and out of scope for [Phase 1 MVP](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/products/Phase%201%20MVP%20Must%20Have%20+%20Nice%20to%20Have.md).
