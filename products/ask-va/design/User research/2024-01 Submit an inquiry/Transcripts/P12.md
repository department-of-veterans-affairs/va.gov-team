# P12 - January 30, 2024

## Transcript

Tyler: Alright, so just confirming one more time. Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio?

> P12: Yes.

Tyler: Okay, thanks so much, [P12], so I know that was a little bit of a headache for the last 20 min or so for you. So I really appreciate you kind of pushing through and getting set up. Before we get started with the prototype. I'd I'd love to just learn a little bit more about you and your experience with the Va. How long have you been a veteran?

> P12: Since 1998.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So been a veteran since 98. Did you start interacting with the VA right after you got out of service, or just in the last couple of years?

> P12: No, it was later, a few years later.

Tyler: And now how are you interacting with the VA? Are you enrolled in healthcare or?

> P12: Fairly regularly. Yes. And I'm involved in health care, too.

Tyler: Okay. have you ever contacted the VA?

> P12: Yes.

Tyler: How do you usually contact the VA, do you call them? Or email, or another way?

> P12: I've done. I've done both, on phone and I've also messaged them through the app, wwhere you can message your provider. I guess, for the care. I'm also calling to find out when I have an appointment.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:02:01.769

Tyler: Okay, cool. So a couple of different ways that you're interacting with the VA. And one of those is through the mobile app, sounds like you're often contacting them. Maybe about healthcare appointments. Things like that.

Tyler: Is this the VA mobile app?

> P12: Yes.

Tyler: Awesome. Okay. Well, that's really helpful. Just to get an idea of your interactions with the VA in the past. So today, we're gonna ask you some questions and look through this prototype together. So we can get your feedback.

Tyler: So the next thing we need to do is set you up with this prototype on your phone. Okay. So what's gonna happen is, I'm gonna send you a link to a prototype in the the chat.

[Screen share, audio issues, Tyler ends up sharing her screen instead]

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:39.829

Tyler: So I'm just getting myself set up and let me know when you can see my screen.

> P12: I can.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So we're looking at what you were just looking at. So together, we're gonna look through this prototype now, and I'll ask you some questions. Okay, we might go a little bit more quickly, or I might skip some questions just because I don't want to take up too much of your time, and I know we spend a lot of time already setting ourselves up.

Tyler: So we're looking at this first page here, and tell me what you're noticing. As we look at this.

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:26.080

> P12: I can see, it says to sign in. Signing is required if the questions about education benefit.

Tyler: And I'll keep scrolling. Just so you can see a little bit more.

Tyler: And what would someone come to this page to do?

> P12: I guess if it was about your education benefits, work study or debt. I guess education.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.520

Tyler: So it feels like it's a place where you could maybe ask something about education.

Tyler: Awesome. So for the rest of our conversation today, we're gonna pretend, like you need to ask the VA a question. We're gonna say that you're noticing you have some problems with your hearing, and you wanna ask the VA, how to get your hearing checked. Tyler: So you don't know how to get your hearing checked. And you've come here because you're like, how do I? How do I start?

Tyler: So what would you do first? And you can tell me to scroll down or to to click?

> P12: Yeah, I guess I would scroll down until I saw something on health. Like, reading that first page, I'm thinking like this part only deals with questions about the GI bill, stuff like that.

Tyler: Right okay.

Tyler: So we would be looking for something that says health cause. It feels like this is just for education. I can totally see that. Awesome. Does it feel like you need to sign in? You mentioned signing in.

> P12: Well, that first part pretty much says to sign in. It seems like, only if it's gonna be about education, debt or something else. See? Right there, to me, the only reason I would be on this page is if my question was about education benefits, work study or debt. I'd be like I must have to go to a different page or something about health.

Tyler: hat's really helpful feedback. I can totally see why this feels like it's just for education. And and you would leave the page and maybe go somewhere else. That makes a lot of sense. So this is actually for more than just asking about education, which obviously, we need to work on on making that more clear.

> P12: Maybe if they reword it. Because if your question is about education, maybe even a comma after education. You know, education comma benefits. To me, it's just like education benefits.

Tyler: Yeah. I think that makes a lot of sense. I'm seeing that now, that's really helpful. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna pretend like today you're not gonna sign in what do you think will be different if we don't sign in to ask a question?

> P12: Well, I would think that I wasn't getting the full benefit of the page without signing in. I think I'd get back to like a watered down version.

Tyler: Mmm. Yeah. When you say a watered down version? What do you kind of? Can you describe that to me?

> P12: Probably like a separate web page, it just has a list of maybe a different, I guess maybe just a generic answer to some of that, you know, about, like some of the things I wanted to know about this website.

Tyler: Yeah, totally. So it feels like it'll be more generic. You'll get like less specific information. And you called it like a watered down version. If you don't sign in.

Tyler: that's really helpful. I think that makes sense. Okay. So we're gonna click, continue without signing in. So I've just clicked that. And now we're on this new page. Can you describe to me what we're looking at here?

> P12: Yeah, just, it's trying to to categorize like subject topic. Like what I want to ask the question about and I'd hit the dropdown and then I would guess, if you like, yeah, that's what I figured like education and disability.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So now, it's obviously showing you more things besides, just education, which was kind of confusing before, if your question is about getting your how to get your hearing checked. What would you choose in this list?

> P12: Healthcare.

Tyler: Okay, let's go ahead and choose healthcare. So I'm going to click. Continue. Now we'll go to the next page. And now, can you describe to me what we're seeing here?

> P12: Yeah. pretty much, like, I would click on that first one. Okay.

Tyler: I'm gonna move us along just because of the interest of time. But that felt like pretty quick. It was pretty obvious that it was healthcare. And now it feels like pretty obvious to choose audiology and hearing aids. So we'll click. Continue now.

Tyler: And now, what are we seeing on this page?

> P12: If it was specific to me, or if it was a general question question. I guess if I had a veteran who I was helping, I'd click on someone else's benefits. Like, if I'm the son or daughter a another veteran, I guess. Trying to get help for them. Or caregiver maybe.

Tyler: Right. Okay. So in this scenario, where you have a question about how to get your hearing checked?

> P12: Yeah, I would just do me. I would go my own VA Benefits.

Tyler: Okay cool. And when would you use It's a general question?

> P12: I guess I could use it for this one? But me, personally, I would do my own Va benefits. A general question, I don't know, I guess, if it was something like the closest facility to me, or maybe to get a number like a 1-800 number. But I can see that's at the bottom of the page.

Tyler: Okay. That's really helpful. So you described how you might use these different options. And for today we'll choose my own VA benefits like you said. so I'm gonna go ahead and click to the next screen before I do that. How how much longer do you think this is gonna take? This process.

> P12: I would think it wouldn't take long, maybe like 5 min.

Tyler: What other kinds of questions do you feel like the Va. Needs to ask you?

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:44.569

> P12: And my question was about getting my hearing?

Tyler: Yeah, it was about getting your hearing checked.

> P12: Well, I guess if I clicked on my own Va Benefits. They would be telling me if I was eligible to get... if it's free, like a free hearing exam or whatever. I would see is like, it would tell me where I'm at. I guess you know I have, like priority 1, priority 2 for health care. And then I guess I would expect to see like a list like, do you want an appointment. Do you want test results, like, from a previous test.

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:52.189

Tyler: Okay, cool. So we're gonna choose my own Va benefits. And then we're thinking the questions might be trying to check if you're eligible, if your benefits will cover getting your hearing checked. That makes sense.

Tyler: Let's go ahead and click continue. And now we're on this next page here. Can you describe this to me?

> P12: Yeah, it's just why we're contacting the VA.

Tyler: Why is the Va asking you this?

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:20.439

> P12: I guess to figure out where to, like our who do we refer your question to, because I guess if it's like customer service, I guess it pretty much would be the complaint or say something nicer the suggestion, but I think the other 2 would like redirect you somewhere else

Tyler: Okay. So they're trying to figure out where to send your question. Does this feel like the right moment in this process for them to ask you that?

> P12: Yeah, I would think so.

Tyler: Yeah, okay, cool. Alright. Well, which one would you choose here in this scenario?

> P12: I have a question.

Tyler: Okay, let's go ahead and choose that. And did I send a little bit of a laugh on your end?

> P12: Yeah, because, I'm trying to figure out how to make an appointment. So I have a question, like, maybe how to make my appointment? Or who to contact to make an appointment.

Tyler: Yeah, okay. do you think you'd ever use this form for a different one of these options just personally?

> P12: I guess maybe for the complaint or the the compliment. I guess probably not as often.

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:05.580

Tyler: Yeah, not as often. Okay, cool. We're going to click, continue. And now, what are we seeing here? What what do we do on this page?

> P12: Just type in what my question is. Like I'll just in like, can I make an appointment for a hearing test or hearing exams.

Tyler: cool. So we just type in our question. And you described how you might do that. And at this point, how much longer do you think this is going to take?

00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:32.170

> P12: Oh. Well right here from looking at that box, I would think it was gonna take a little longer.

Tyler: Which which box are you looking at to help you figure that out?

> P12: Because usually like you know when you're, like on a chat, like, how we were in that last one. And you saying, Can you hear me? And I was like, no, I can't hear. That's the kind of box I would expect to see this, I'd be looking like they're gonna get back to me in 3 to 4 days, or, you know, like it's not gonna be, it's gonna take a while. That's what this box is.

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:17.389

Tyler: Okay, Gotcha. So you don't feel like it's like a one on one chat with somebody the way we were doing. It's more like, I'm submitting this. And then you're going to get back to me in a while.

> P12: Right like when you submit a question to a website or something. And they're asking, do this. And then they'll tell you like, we'll get back to 2 to 3 business days, or whatever.

Tyler: Right. Okay, that's really helpful. So the way this looks make you feel like it'll be that experience where it takes a bit longer, and you have to wait on them.

> P12: It doesn't look like a chat box, like when it says do you want to chat to an agent or chat with somebody.

Tyler: Right. That makes sense. That's a really helpful observation. Alright, I'm gonna click, continue. So we're gonna pretend like we typed in your question. I'm not actually gonna type it in today. And now we're seeing this page. Can you tell me how you would answer this page?

> P12: Click I'm the Veteran and hit continue.

Tyler: And why do you think the Va. Asked you that?

> P12: I don't know, because they asked you on the first question, it was like you were, what's your question and you're like I'm the Veteran and I'm doing it for someone else's claim, you know like a couple of screens back.

Tyler: Yeah. I remember that I know what you're talking about. So it feels like you've already told them you're a Veteran.

> P12: Right. And you were because you're researching your VA...

Tyler: right. Yeah, that makes sense. So this feels repetitive. Okay. So it was easy to answer. But it does feel repetitive. So we'll click. Continue.

00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:54.090

Tyler: Okay. And now, what is this question here?

> P12: Just asking if I work for the VA. No.

00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:05.329

Tyler: Okay, cool. So you hit No, also pretty quick to answer this one. Why did it ask if you're an employee?

> P12: I don't know, but I noticed, I think I've seen it before, actually on a couple of the VA questions, I can't remmeber, I don't know why they ask but I'm figuring it must be some reason.

Tyler: Yeah, okay, cool. We'll we'll click no, and we'll click, continue. And now we're looking at this screen. So before we start looking at this in detail. How much longer do you think this process is? Gonna take you said originally you said about 5 min.

> P12: Yeah. Well, like, I said. And as soon as I saw that other screen. I was like, oh this is going to take a while.

Tyler: Yeah, okay, so that seeing that, what's your question box made, you think.

> P12: And this too. It says tell us about yourself. At the beginning, did we sign in?

Tyler: We didn't sign in. How do you think that would impact what this page looks like or whether it's here?

> P12: I would be thinking, okay, if we signed in, it should already be up there like auto fill.

00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:34.2

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense. So if you sign in, you think this should be auto filled? and you would just like review it and make sure it's right?

> P12: Right. Yeah.

Tyler: Okay, Gotcha. And in this case we didn't sign in. So that's why they're asking us?

> P12: I suppose.

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:45.709

Tyler: okay. yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: So let's go ahead and look through these together. So tell me if anything stands out at you, I'm gonna scroll slowly.

> P12: Yeah, just the pronouns.

Tyler: Okay, let's talk about the pronouns. What makes that stand out to you?

> P12: I think that's just a personal preference as far as, like, some people, more liberal. Whereas, like me, I think, like, I'm more conservative. I'm thinking that, do we really need that? So actually when I first saw it I was like, ugh, this again, really? Like, I said, that's a personal opinion.

Tyler: Yeah, well, I'm here to learn your personal opinions. So that that's helpful to understand. If if that's how you felt, what would you do here? Does it look like you need to answer this, or What are your options?

00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:10.180

> P12: Well, to me, that's kind of like you know how they ask. Like, do you want to answer if you're Hispanic, or whatever. But it's not required. So I don't think this should be required. I don't even know why this is, I don't think this should be here to tell you the truth. But I understand everybody gets offended.

Tyler: It feels like it shouldn't be required. And then you say, actually, it almost feels like this doesn't need to be here. But you kind of understand where it's coming from. It just doesn't feel like something you need.

> P12: Right.

Tyler: Yeah. that makes sense. That's really helpful feedback. I wanna jump up here real quick and talk about one more thing before we move on. We've got social security number or service number here. Obviously. Don't tell me your social security number. But how would you answer this? Would you put in your social security number? Would you put in your service number?

> P12: My understanding is that chances are that your service number is basically your social security number, unless it came in during a certain time like Vietnam or something. When people actually got drafted.

Tyler: Right? Okay? So for you, because of when you join the service, you you have a social security number as your service number.

Tyler: Alright, I'm gonna move us along just in the interest of time. But I'm curious if your reaction to pronouns is the same for gender or different.

> P12: Yeah, pretty much. But I think the pronouns are a little bit more....

Tyler: o pretty much the same reaction, but a little bit more frustrated for lack of a better word with the pronouns.

> P12: Right.

Tyler: Okay, cool. alright. Well click. Continue. We'll pretend like we filled in these questions.

00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:42.760

Tyler: And now we don't have a lot of time. So I'm just gonna skip through this really quick. And I'm gonna tell you what I'm doing as I skip through it. Okay, so we've got this question where it's saying your Va health facility, and you can search by name, or you can search by location. So I'm gonna pretend, like we're searching by name. And your facility starts with James.

Tyler: So we type in James. Now we're looking in this list to find the right one. Let's say your facility is James J. Peter's. So we choose that facility. Okay? And I'm we're seeing this list. And normally, I'd be asking for your feedback. But I wanna make sure we move us along. So we're gonna say, we chose this one and we're gonna click, continue okay?

Tyler: Alright. So before we ask about this page, how much longer do you think this form is going to be?

> P12: I don't know. Maybe like, now, I'm thinking, like another 15 min. It slowed down. I mean I figure it would have been pretty easy, like, I think, if I were to sign in, boom, you have my information. I just say, hey – Or maybe just even another buttons that says, you know, make an appointment.

Tyler: Okay so throughout the process, your expectations keep shifting. And you're like, wow, this is taking longer than I thought. And then again, okay, this is taking a lot longer than I expected.

> P12: Right. And I think when it first started, I was like should be fairly quick, and then you hit that, you know type in your question here. And I was like ah. Then when you get into the pronouns and, I don't know, what the other one was sexuality or something. I was like, to me, it's already taken too long. But I can just say that should have been more simple.

Tyler: Right and if you'd signed in, we would have had some of your information right? Would we still be asking you all these questions? If you signed in, or would? How would that be different?

00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:01.222

> P12: I mean, I think it was one longer it needed. So hopefully, I wish we can sign in, your information is there, maybe has a couple of buttons, you know, like, okay, cause this is under health care, right. Cause we did, right? We went to healthcare on that dropdown. Yeah, we did. So when you sign in, I would hope that it would just be like, like there'd be like a couple of questions located facility, make an appointment. And then I guess some stuff that sounds like My HealtheVet, you know, like prescriptions, or whatever.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. So this feels like in general like this is too long. It should be more simple. There should be less questions, even if I did sign in this still would be a little bit too much information for what I'm actually trying to do.

> P12: Right. I would, I would hope, like after you signed in it would ask you, hey? What would you like to do? Click on appointment? Then maybe ask, you look nearest facility. You click on that.

Tyler: That makes sense. Why do you think it's asking for your phone number and email here?

> P12: Oh, just to contact you. 

Tyler: So we'll pretend like we're putting in your phone and email, and we'll go to the next page.

Tyler: And on this page, what would you normally choose here?

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:38.299

> P12: Phone, if they had like text, okay.

Tyler: So you'd prefer text. But you'd choose phone, probably on this page?

> P12: Phone or email. awesome. So for the purpose of looking at this, sometimes I'm like, are they gonna call me? Because I know a lot of people like myself. I don't answer numbers like, I don't know. Or. So email is a good kind of backup option.

Tyler: Yeah, that's a good point. Alright.

> P12: But, text will be nice to see.

Tyler: yeah, I can definitely see that.

Tyler: That makes sense so text would be nice to see cause you're assuming phone probably means a call.

> P12: Right, I mean, I would be hoping it would be text.

Tyler: Yeah, that's helpful it maybe that's not super clear by just saying phone. so I think that's really good feedback.

Tyler: Okay? So for for now we've only got a couple of minutes left in our session. We're gonna just I'm gonna click through some screens, and I'm gonna tell you what I'm doing, cause I want you to get to the end of the process because I know it's really unsatisfying to not finish something. So we're gonna click on us mail. We're gonna pretend like, that's your preference. I know that's not your preference. And then we would be asking for your country here. Okay, so I'm gonna choose United States just to move us along.

Tyler: And now we're asking for your mailing address. Okay, so just a pretty standard mailing address form, and we'll pretend like we filled that out. And I'm gonna click, continue.

Tyler: And now we're seeing this where we're confirming your mailing address. Have you seen something like this before?

> P12: Yeah.

Tyler: Okay, so we're gonna go with the suggested address. And I'm gonna click, continue. alright. So can you tell me what we're seeing on this page. What's the purpose of this page?

> P12: I guess you're trying to narrow it down to give you an answer to your question.

Tyler: So are they going to ask you more questions to narrow it down?

> P12: And it's, see to me, it's kind of a little repetitive, because when we first came in, it had those questions you wanted to know about and we click like health care. You know. We didn't click education. We didn't click. So the category, you can already know it pertains to healthcare. I mean, I would just like to see, like. Like I said, like, Hey, maybe it's like...

> P12: your health records. And I guess maybe that's what this is. But to me it's just asking like too many things again, like.

Tyler: I can totally see that.

> P12: We just put in everything we just put in, you know, social, our date of birth, our address, our pronouns, or whatever. And then it's asking for more information or like. Oh, I guess that's what my question has right. If my question... is about my personal information in this.

00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:29.83

> P12: I would think those would be the questions people are gonna ask about either an appointment. Their medication. Health records. And I guess they would narrow it down from there.

Tyler:  that makes a lot of sense. I can see how this feels really repetitive and it's not really meeting your expectation generally speaking of how the service would work. So that's really useful feedback. Because of the time I'm just gonna go ahead and submit our question. I'm gonna have to click through. I think.

Tyler: Some things. So you can just bear with me real quick. And we'll submit the question. Okay, so now we're on this page. This is the last page in the service, or in this website.

Tyler: can you have a read through this? And then just tell me what you what you learned.

> P12: Yeah, that's pretty much what like, I said, when I saw that one question, I'm like, okay, they're gonna get back to me. Like I have to wait now.

> P12: Right. Cause you're saying about, cause we're gonna make it a hearing exam, right? That's what it was for. Like. yeah, yeah, this is way, too long.

Tyler: Yeah that's really helpful. I'm gonna stop sharing my screen. I see we've only got like a minute or 2 left.

Tyler: So we can just chat for the last minute or 2. It was really helpful to hear your reflections throughout that I'm so glad we managed to get that working so we could hear some of your feedback. It was really useful.

Tyler: I'm curious like. Throughout that process we talked about this scenario where you're, you know, setting up this, you wanna ask the VA how to get your hearing checked. But I wonder if this would be any different or your reaction would be any different if your question wasn't about your healthcare.

Tyler: So let's say, your question was like which education benefit?

> P12: Yeah, no. Then I think maybe. But even then 7 days.

Tyler: Right okay.

> P12: Unless it was like a really like specific question. Because otherwise, I think, like that, this is the app or the website?

00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:59.456

Tyler: This is on the website. Well, this will be on the website.

> P12: To me, it really doesn't seem that helpful.

Tyler: Yeah, I think that makes sense. It feels like...

> P12: The time wasted putting in all your info, and then I'll send, then you gotta wait 7 days for the answer, and I think that people are, maybe it's just our expectations now, everybody wants everything quickly, you know. I think, using the website's not that bad right now, because a lot of times you can click on stuff like you said like education benefits. And it tells you like the process. Or it will direct to, you know, send you in the right direction.

> P12: You know what I mean. I mean it. It does kind of suck cause. Sometimes you go in between like it seems like I know they're trying to like combine them all. But, like before you, it's like you'd have to go to my healthyeVet then, if you wanted to see something, you had to go to a different website, and you'd have to use a different login. Between, like 2 or 3 websites or I guess sites. And and I think you're doing a better job now. But.

00:41:15.830 --> 00:41:35.989

Tyler: right. Okay, so you feel like this isn't really adding value to the way that the website is already set up where you can go and find information, and it will be like there for you, whereas here you have to put in a bunch of information, and then you have to wait 7 days, right? I can totally see how that doesn't meet your expectations, and it doesn't really add extra value for you.

Tyler: So, [P12], I see we're at our time. I do want to give you a couple of minutes in case you want to ask me any questions. Was this your first time taking part in research?

> P12: No, I did one other one. I can't remember what that one? 

Tyler: Yeah, that's okay. Do you have any questions for me?

> P12: I guess the biggest thing on this. Just if they would have put a comma.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And we've spoken to some other veterans who have also found it confusing that it's not just about education but didn't necessarily call out that a comma could help. So that was really useful. And honestly, all of your feedback is really useful. You noticed a lot of things that I would never notice, and that other people haven't noticed. So that's why we really value spending some time with you like this. I also particularly appreciate that it was super hard to get set up on Zoom this morning, and I'm sorry about that. I appreciate you pushing through, and I'm glad it worked out.

Tyler: But yeah, thank you so much for your time I'm gonna let you go and I hope you have a lovely rest of your day. If you have any questions you can reach out to the folks who set up this session. They're gonna send you a thank you. Note so you can ask them any questions if you have them.

Tyler: Alright. Thanks, [P12].

> P12: Thank you.
