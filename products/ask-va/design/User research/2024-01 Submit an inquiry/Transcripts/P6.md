# P6 - January 25, 2024

## Transcript

Tyler: All right. So are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio today?

> P6: Yes, I am.

Tyler: Well, thanks so much, P6. I see Jaime's here. So I'm going to admit Jaime to the meeting.

Tyler: And then, hi Jaime. Hopefully, you can hear us and maybe see us.

Tyler: Awesome. It looks like Jaime's joined us. Jaime, I'm just gonna have you go on mute and turn your camera off. We've just went through the consent process. So P6 and I are ready to get started. So thanks for joining.

Tyler: All right.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:44.400

Tyler: Okay, P6. So before we look at this prototype, I'm just gonna ask you a couple of questions just to get to know you a little bit better. How long have you been a veteran?

> P6: Well, so I'm still actually active duty. I got out in 2012 for a little while and came back in. And so I'm still. I'm still in. I'm just, I'm on terminal leave. I'm not on terminal leave. I'm sorry I'm on con leave. I had surgery on Friday. So yeah. Yeah. But I've contacted the VA for GI bill benefits and mental health reasons as well.

Tyler: Yeah, that's helpful. When you contacted the VA in the past. Did you call them? Or how did you get in touch with the VA.

> P6: So initially with the GI bill stuff through online, submitted everything to. I transferred my benefits to my spouse and then tried to contact them. And you know, on her behalf, essentially to streamline the process because it was taking a while to get that initiated with the I called for mental health reasons. But I had a direct number to a local VA center.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:56.730

> P6: When I was in upstate New York, and they got me taken care of like instantly. But I've also, you know, I've tried to call for GI bill benefits.

> P6: That can be quite the process.

Tyler: Yeah. When you say that can be quite the process. What do you mean by that?

> P6: Well, just being on it. They put you on hold, and you know it's a you do the prompt to who you want to speak to, and then you can be in the – what do they call it? You can be in the wait, you know, in the queue next, for you know, whoever who knows how long the time you can. The time can vary, just depending on what time of the day you call, if you call early, you know your likelihood of getting in quicker is much better. But if you try to call, you know, like most people during lunch, or whatever you're gonna you're gonna be on hold for a while. You know, I understand everybody has shortages, and the VA's no exception, you know.

Tyler: So yeah, well, it sounds like you had, you have different experiences like when you've gotten in touch directly with the VA in New York. That was like a little bit faster and maybe more urgent. And then, yeah. Calling on the phone can be a little bit more of a wait. Well, that's helpful background for me to understand. I'm sure we'll talk more about that as we go through the the session.

Tyler: I think, for now, though, we can go ahead and start looking at this prototype, so I mentioned that it's not gonna work perfectly. I'm gonna ask you to kinda like pause and not just like click around as as you like, because we might get confused with how the prototype works. So just bear with me with that. So I'm gonna send you a link in the chat on Zoom.

Tyler: This is always a little tricky on a phone, but we can definitely do it. So you should see a link pop up, and then if you click on that link and open it on your phone and then let me know when you see that on your phone.

> P6: Okay, I see.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So now we're gonna share your screen on Zoom. Have you done that before?

> P6: No... I'll see. So do I go back to zoom.

Tyler: Yeah. So you're going to go back to Zoom. Sorry I thought it was frozen.

Tyler: You're going to go back to the Zoom window where you can hopefully see my face.

Tyler: And then when you're on the Zoom window if you hover around, you'll be able to see some menu options.

> P6: Let's see.

Tyler: And it should say, share screen. I think it's a green button?

> P6: Yeah, I don't see it.

Tyler: You're not seeing it. Okay. Can you describe to me what you're seeing?

> P6: Yeah, so I can... And then, like, right now I see you so I can click. Let's see, touch the screen and up at the top. It tells me I can leave gives me a dropdown for zoom.

Tyler: Okay, maybe the drop down.

> P6: Hmm...

Tyler: Let's see what about the bottom. Do you see a menu at the bottom?

> P6: I see, share screen. There it goes. Bingo.

Tyler: Perfect. Then I'll let you know what I'm seeing. Okay, start broadcast. Great.

> P6: And then I need to go back and find that link?

Tyler: Exactly. Yeah, yeah, perfect. Yeah. And if you want to, you can keep my face there, or you can. I think you might be able to swipe it away. All right. Maybe if I turn my camera off... Awesome thanks for bearing with me. That part's always a little bit tricky.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So we're looking at this website, it says, ask the you can take a moment to just look around. We're not really gonna click on anything yet, and I'd love for you to just tell me what you're noticing first.

> P6: So timeliness. Right? I think that's a big thing, especially with Veterans and trying to get care. And I see that you should receive a response within 7 business days... You know, that's probably, to me, I think that's acceptable. But I know that a lot of people think that every problem that they have should be answered immediately. And that's probably going to throw up some red flags and irritate people with the 7 business days. But it, to me, I feel it's acceptable, you know. I just that's one thing that I see.

Natalie Morales: Is this exactly what someone sees the moment they go to the VA site?

> P6: Yeah, that's the first. So that is the second sentence. The first sentence says, get answers to your questions about VA benefits and services and upload documents online, and you should receive a response within 7 business days.

Natalie Morales: It should be introducing what Ask VA is first...

Tyler: Natalie. Sorry, I'm just gonna ask you to pause, and maybe we can save these questions for the end. Through the research session, I want to let P6 be able to share his thoughts first.

Natalie: Okay, no problem.

Tyler: Thanks. Alright, P6. So it sounds like you're you're seeing the 7 business days which we talked about. What is this service about?

> P6: It's about asking a question.

Tyler: It sounds like, maybe you're thinking about healthcare specifically, can you? What kinds of questions?

> P6: So I think that that's what it's telling me right when I look at this, because it's telling me to upload my documents to receive a response for VA benefits. So that's what I immediately think of, and I think, you know, for the most part I would. I would imagine most Veterans are probably coming to the VA for healthcare.

> P6: I don't know. I honestly would be interested to know what the GI bill benefit looks like, cause I bet you it's... I can't imagine that. You know every Veteran takes it. Well, I know every veteran doesn't, but I bet you maybe 50, probably less than 50% take advantage of GI Bill benefits, you know. So I initially think, hey, you know, I'm calling for healthcare.

> P6: Sorry my phone locked.

> P6: You know, I'm going to seek benefits for healthcare. Right? And you know, it's telling me 7, business days, I should receive a response.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. I'm not able to see your screen anymore. Which is a bit funny.

> P6: Yeah. My phone locked. I'm sorry. Hold on.

Tyler: Oh, that's okay.

> P6: And then go back to Zoom.

Tyler: Oh, perfect. It looks like you're gonna have to share it again annoyingly. We'll make sure we click around a little bit more so that it doesn't lock. That's helpful, though. So it sounds like healthcare, is definitely a primary use for you in terms of the VA. And probably a lot of other Veterans, and it felt like education was like having a big moment on that page we were looking at.

Tyler: Yeah, I totally get that.

Tyler: So I'll give you a second to share your screen, and then I'll tell you a little bit more of the scenario. We're gonna walk through together.

> P6: Okay... Back.

Tyler: perfect. Okay. So today, for the rest of our conversation, we're gonna just pretend like you need to ask the VA a question. We're gonna say that you've recently noticed some problems with your hearing. And you want to ask the VA how you get your hearing checked by an audiologist. So without clicking anything, yet can you tell me what you would do first?

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:46.100

> P6: Sign in or create an account.

Tyler: Does it seem like you need to sign in in order to start?

> P6: It does. I mean that's... But then I'm confused too, because there's the one link that says, that's green, and it talks about signing in for my education benefits or work study. And then there's another sign in or create account below that.

Tyler: And so it's hard to tell the difference between those?

> P6: Yeah... Check the chat status of your question. I mean, I guess without a reference number, I wouldn't use the check.

> P6: I don't know if I click on the Ask VA, is that going to take me to a link to where I can ask?

Tyler: I'm gonna do the annoying researcher thing and not answer your question. But that's helpful to know that that's not clear. And it also is really helpful to see that it feels like you need to sign in. But it's not clear if there's a difference between the 2 different buttons.

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:59.370

> P6: Right. Or there's another link that says, Continue without signing in.

Tyler: Did you just notice that one?

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:08.640

> P6: I did just notice that one, but I mean, and then I continue to scroll down, and it says to call and ask for help. Or if I need help to call, you know, Monday through Friday to 9 Eastern time. At this 1 800 number. But also, if I'm having hearing loss problems. You know, am I gonna be able to?

Tyler: Yeah, that's really helpful. Okay, so I think it's really clear to me that the sign in buttons were more obvious to you than the one that lets you go without signing in. For today, we're gonna go ahead and click continue without signing in. So we're gonna pretend that you don't need to sign in for your question. And we're going to get to this first page.

Tyler: So again, your question is about how to get your hearing checked. With that in mind, can you just show me how you would answer this page. What you would do on this page?

> P6: [Chooses health care]

Tyler: Alright, we can stop here. So you chose health care. That felt like a really quick decision. Did it feel like an obvious choice?

> P6: To me it did, just because... I don't remember what my options were. Can I go back?

Tyler: Yeah, you can go if you go down to the bottom and then you click. There you go, and then you click on back again.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:36.759

> P6: back again. So like, education benefits and work study definitely doesn't fall under disability compensation. I'm not asking to be compensated. I'm asking how I get it checked right? So the disability compensation I feel, would come after. I mean, that's completely separate from having having it checked. And then health care. That's, you know, hearing, I assume. You know I correlate that to health. Debt for benefit over payments.

> P6: I can't scroll down. I'm sorry any further.

Tyler: No, that's okay. I think that sometimes the prototype will be a bit tricky. So let's just talk about that a little bit more. It felt like you were kind of using process of elimination. Healthcare made the most sense from what you can see on the screen.

Tyler: How important do you think it is to answer this question correctly?

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:23.179

> P6: Pretty, I mean pretty important, because if not, it's gonna take you down a rabbit hole, and they're completely separate entities. So there, I mean, if you, if you click on education benefits, it's not even the same department as healthcare or compensation, disability compensation. I mean, they're completely different departments. So you, you know, if you click on the wrong department, it's going to the wrong department.

> P6: You know it's gonna take you down a rabbit hole that you don't need to go down, and then, you know, you're back to pressing one for English, you know.

Tyler: That makes sense. Okay, let's click continue, and we'll see the next screen, which you looked at briefly. So tell me what you're seeing here.

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:22.290

> P6: I see audiology and hearing aids, career opportunities at a VA health facility, caregiver support programs, eligibility, and how to apply family member benefits, our health benefits, foreign medical programs, getting care at the local VA medical center, prosthetics, Vet centers and readjustment counseling and women's health services.

Tyler: So what is this a list of?

> P6: Different options that I guess, you know, that you have available to you through the VA. Pertaining...

> P6: I don't know if the website is, you know, if this trial program is designed this way because I don't know that audiology and hearing aids. I don't know if that, you know traditionally is something outside of outside of normal medical care, you know. I think probably you go to the VA, and they would refer you to see somebody in that regard. But you know I understand. I understand where this is going, too.

> P6: You need a new prosthetic, ou know. It's very clear what I would do if I, you know, needed a prosthetic right? It's just this is clear to me.

Tyler: Okay, so it feels clear kind of what these options are related to and why you might choose one. How is this different from the last page?

> P6: It's more defined, you know, what you're looking for. Now, here's where this okay, so some things that I don't necessarily. Let's see, the career opportunities with VA Health that doesn't really make sense on here. You know. Cause if I already selected that I'm going for health, or I can't remember what my last choice was that got me to here right. But I don't know how career opportunities correlates to that or the caregiver support program. I'm not sure that that correlates to see all these other things as like medical stuff, and then like eligibility, how to apply that should be under receiving compensation. I believe that's what it was.

> P6: But yeah, there's almost, you know, some of it is like completely medical driven. And then other things are not.

Tyler: Right. Okay, there's a couple of things in the list that feel out of place. That's helpful. That makes sense.

Tyler: And so if our question today is about getting your hearing checked, can you show me what you would do on this page?

Tyler: Perfect. We'll just stay here for a second. So we found an option pretty quickly for hearing. What if you couldn't find an option that fit your needs in this list, what would you do, realistically?

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:46.400

> P6:  I'd probably just hit the getting care at a local VA medical center, and, you know, and hope that that would refer me somewhere, because it's not like there's an 'other' where I can list what I'm looking for, you know, put in there to where it goes to something. I think that that might be helpful. If if that was an option. But, you know, that's also an easy button, too, for somebody to not actually look for what they're, you know, looking for.

Tyler: Right. Okay. So you would make a best guess, maybe choose a more general option, and you try and keep going like that.

Tyler: That makes sense. Alright. Let's click continue. We'll go to the next page.

Tyler: Alright. What is this question asking you?

> P6: What's your question about. Well, I mean, I get, I think it's asking me why I'm coming, or you know, what I'm trying to accomplish right. Like, what is it for me, for somebody else? Or is it just a broad question that I'm trying to get in touch with.

> P6: I mean, it's not a clear statement. I guess if that makes sense.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. So in this scenario, we're asking about getting your hearing checked. What would you choose, do you think?

> P6: Probably my own VA benefits, or it's a general question. I mean it. One or the other. I guess it depends if...

> P6: I know how the VA works, because I've worked for a wire transition unit before I got out of the army. So I know that, you know, unless you're over 50, I believe, or maybe more, it basically, it needs to be service connected in order for them to be you for you to be seen under their care. Right? Now the catch with that is, you can always be seen at the VA, it's just you may have to pay for it.

> P6: So it depends. If it was something that was diagnosed and was, you know, approved by the VA, then it would be my own VA benefits. If it was something I was already being treated for. I think if it was, you know, something new like I lost my hearing, you know, or my hearing continues getting worse, and I need to have it checked. I think it would be a general question. So it I think it depends on the scenario there, too.

> P6: Like for me, I have hearing aids. I'm talking to you through my hearing aids, so I already know when I get out, that'll be something that is connected with the VA, right? So for me personally, it would be my own VA benefits.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. And we talked a little bit earlier about I think it was your wife using your GI bill benefits. Well, if you were asking a question related to that which one would you choose?

> P6: Well, so if it was me, it would still be there my benefits. She's just able to use them. So if it was her trying to get in touch with the VA, then it would be someone else's VA benefits .

Tyler: That's really helpful. Alright. So for today we're gonna choose my own VA benefits. And then we'll just click Continue.

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:56.980

> P6: Now, I understand that is very confusing for people, too, because, like, they don't understand that – like I didn't understand – I couldn't call on her behalf, like, they're still my benefits. Like, why can't I figure out what's going on with my benefits for her? You know?

Tyler: I totally hear you there.

Tyler: So, before we look too closely at this question, how much longer do you think this forms gonna be?

> P6: The form itself? Well, I'm assuming just 2 more questions.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. And now, looking at this question, why do you think the VA is asking you this? I'll give you a minute to read it.

> P6: It's probably just a general question to figure out, you know, whether, if it's, whether you're trying to get information or file a complaint, I suppose? Or make, I mean, or make, I don't know... It's a kind of an odd question. I mean, obviously like, I'm, it almost feels out a place because I'm reaching out to the VA because I need something right? This isn't, II don't feel like this is the place to say something nice or file a complaint. If that makes sense?

Tyler: That makes sense.

> P6: That's probably for a survey purpose, not when I'm trying to ask a question or get an answer. I just kind of feel like, that's out of place.

Tyler: Yeah, I think that's really helpful. I can see why it feels that way.

Tyler: Well, today, let's choose I have a question.

> P6: Okay.

Tyler: And then we'll just click, continue. And now we're on this page. So I'm gonna ask you one more time, how much longer do you think this form is going to be?

> P6: Well, I thought 2 more questions, but it's probably going to be 10 more.

Tyler: And why are you saying 10?

> P6: I have no idea how much longer it's gonna be.

Tyler: And now, looking at, I mean, I would assume, you know, if I'm guessing, it's probably asking me what my question is, it's probably gonna ask me where I'm located, so it can place me in contact with somebody near nearby. Probably get contact information, that sort of thing. So I don't know how many more screens it would walk me down, but just trying to use logic. I think that would probably be a good process to follow.

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:27.329

Tyler: That's really helpful. So you need to give them your question on this screen, obviously, and you need to give them where you're located, your contact information. And then, is there anything else you think you need to give the VA?

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:57.180

> P6:  I don't know. Do you know, when I got out I never got a Vet ID card, so I don't know if there's like a number associated with that or not, because I know that they, I mean, in order for you to get healthcare, you've got to prove that you were a Veteran, if you're not already in the system, so you either have that, or you don't have that right. So probably something to prove that I would assume that you're a Veteran.

Tyler: Alright. And then, looking at this page, we're not actually gonna type anything in today. But does this feel straightforward? Do you know what you would do on this page?

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:28.340

> P6: It is to me. But I'm sure there's people in my cohort that wouldn't be able to figure it out, you know.

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:47.660

Tyler: Yeah. And on the next page we're probably expecting to see something like your, what's your location?

Tyler: Okay, let's click continue. We'll imagine that we typed in your question about hearing. And then we just click, continue. And now we're seeing this page.

00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:58.560

> P6: Hey!

Tyler: So tell me about that reaction.

> P6: Well, I just, it makes sense. You know what I mean, I'm sure that the VA gets a lot of people that waste their time. You know, people that were chaptered out of the military or not. You know they're not eligible for benefits, for whatever reason. Right? And you know, the VA is a busy place. They don't necessarily have the time to vet people that aren't qualified. So yeah, that makes sense.

> P6: Like, I said, I don't know if there's a number associated with the Veteran, or if it goes off your social or how that works, I don't recall.

> P6: But yeah, I mean, the screen makes sense to me. I am a veteran, right? Like that.

> P6: Or if it was my spouse trying to contact you to set up something for me. I mean, it's still pretty straightforward.

Tyler: Yeah, okay, so it seems pretty easy to answer this. And it seems like it's a way to for us to know that you are definitely a Veteran, or you're definitely a family member. Does this feel like the right time for us to ask you this question?

> P6: Mmm. Probably should ask at the very beginning.

> P6: In my opinion, I mean, I guess I don't really care if you're wasting somebody's time that's not a Veteran, but you know, for a Veteran, right? I mean, I know if I'm a Veteran it's not gonna frustrate me. If it's at this point. Because it's not like, it's gonna preclude me right? So now...

> P6: But here's the thing right. It doesn't give you an option to not be a Veteran. So like, what if I did this, you know being active duty? If I came here  you know, because I can't go to the VA right now to get healthcare. Or, you know, being on active duty because I have atricia so you know that maybe something to look at, you know. Just so people understand?

Tyler: Yeah, I can see that. So it feels like, it's fine because you're a Veteran. You can access VA services that you would just have this question whenever and it's easy to answer. But if it's trying to filter people out, it needs to happen early on. That makes sense.

00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:43.450

> P6: Honestly, I think if you're at this, you know, I'm sorry but I think if you're you know at, if you're at this depth into the VA system, you're probably there for the right reason, right? Like you, you know, I don't think anybody's going to go through this if they're not qualified. So yeah.

00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:54.350

Tyler: Alright. Well, we're on this new screen now. And why do you think the VA is asking you this question?

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:58.700

> P6: That? I don't know. I don't know if you're precluded from being seen at the VA if you're an employee there, I don't know. Not sure on that one. Yeah

Tyler: Do you feel like you're gonna receive a different service, depending on how you answer this?

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:16.320

> P6: I don't. I don't feel that way. No, I just know that sometimes with like GI employees and soldiers that serve in the guard, they're not it eligible for like tricare reserve select, right? They have to buy their benefits through their employer. So I don't know if the VA is, you know, something along those lines to where they're not eligible for service if they work there. I don't know.

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:45.769

Tyler: Yeah, that's okay. I don't know is a good answer, too. So it feels like it might be another way of filtering who can do certain things?

> P6: Yeah.

Tyler: Okay. And how would you answer this question? You can just show me.

> P6: I mean, I would click no.

Tyler: Okay, let's click No and then we'll click Continue.

> P6: Okay.

Tyler: alright. So we're not actually gonna type anything in, like I said, but let's look at these questions, and then I want to know if anything is standing out to you, so you can just talk aloud as you're looking at this page.

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:16.170

> P6: No, nothing in first name, middle or last. That's pretty standard. Preferred name, I guess I can see that. Like my name is P6, but I go by [nickname], so sure.

> P6: Service number. So that's gonna start meaning a lot of different things to people here real soon. Like I have a DoD ID number, right? Couldn't tell you what it is. Have no idea. And anytime I call the hospital here to make an appointment. They are like, hey, what's your DoD ID number? Couldn't tell you, I don't know. But I'll give you my social security number. I think you'll see this younger generation of soldiers, sailors, and marines, and airmen, will probably equate that to their DoD ID number in the future.

> P6: But, like my generation. We don't have a service number that's like World War II era, Vietnam era. That's not a thing for us. So like we just go off for social, but it's not saying that it's required either. Please provide one or the other. So you know, most people know their social. That's pretty standard date of birth, obviously. Again, that's pretty standard.

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:36.329

> P6: I'm not gonna get into the pronouns thing. That's not for me.

Tyler: So if that's not for you, how would you answer that question?

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:44.779

> P6: he him his, I guess.

Tyler: Okay, so you would just kind of, choose an option. Alright.

> P6: Yeah, do I have to choose an option? Yeah, I guess it says I have to.

> P6: Yeah. And the gender identity. Yeah, I don't get behind all that stuff. So I'm a man.

Tyler: Yeah, so would you choose to answer that question?

> P6: Man. Okay.

Tyler: Alright. We went through that pretty quickly. It felt fairly straightforward. I don't think I have any follow up questions on that one.

Tyler: So we'll pretend, like we filled it in with your information. And then we're gonna click continue.

> P6: Okay.

Tyler: And now I'd just love for you to describe what you're looking at to me.

00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:46.730

> P6: The VA health facility. So it looks like a search. And then I don't know what I put in there. I mean, search, so that there's a dropdown or plus underneath it that says search by location. So I guess I would click on that, because that you know, how would I know unless I was being seen right?

> P6: Well, it's twofold, because I may know what facility I'm supposed to be seeing that. But say, I'm contacting via for the first time, I would probably search my location.

Tyler: Okay. So if you didn't know your facility yet, you would search by location.

Tyler: But then, if you knew the name like, let's say – I think you said you might have went to a VA Health health facility in New York – so if you knew the name of that facility, can you just give me an idea of what you would type in there?

> P6: Yeah, I would type in like Watertown Vet center, I think, is what it was called. And that, you know, I'm sure that that would get me close.

Tyler: Okay, cool. And which one would you use now with your current Veteran status?

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:43.909

> P6: Probably search by location. Because, like I live in Colorado Springs. It's huge. I don't know. There may be multiple centers here. I don't know. You know, I know, like my brother in law lives in Georgia, and I think there's 2 VA hospitals alone right there where he lives. So he he probably has more options than a lot of people where the, you know, I lived in rural Montana for a long time. And there I don't even, I think it was like 3 to 4 hours to the closest VA.

Tyler: Right. Okay so I get the sense that you can see a use for both options, searching by name or searching by location.

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:35.110

> P6: Yeah, the the only thing is the search by location. I'm wondering if you could just put that function into the VA health facility, you know, or somehow, like search by location or for the health facility. If it was in either or right where you could either put the town in that you're you know, closest to, or that you know wherever you're at, or, if it was I could punch in the exact facility.

Tyler: Right. Okay. So taking the decision out of your hands, you can just type in what you want to type in, and then it'll give you the the list. That makes sense.

Tyler: Alright. So we're not gonna type in this today. And it is a prototype. So it's not gonna work perfectly. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna pretend like your health facility starts with the the word James.

Tyler: So I'm gonna have you click on that box? Yeah, perfect. And then we're gonna pretend like you typed in James. And then let's say your health facilities, called James J. Peters, can you just show me what you would do here?

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: So what are we seeing now?

Tyler: Can you describe this to me?

> P6: Yeah, I just see a blue, the blue check or blue, the circles filled in next to James J. Peter, Department of Veteran Affairs Medical Center, Bronx, New York.

Tyler: So it looks like you've chosen an option now. And what if – we don't need to click anything – but what if you realize that you had chosen the wrong health facility, what would you do at this point?

> P6: Either hit back or try to, I mean, I guess if it was a different option, say, it was James A. Then I would go up and click on that one. I would assume that it would transfer back.

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:36.669

Tyler: Okay, cool. Let's click continue and we'll move on.

Tyler: Alright so before we talk about this page, I just want to check in. How much longer do you think this forms going to be?

> P6: Hopefully, not much longer. I would think that we're about done. I mean, I don't know what else it could possibly ask. Yeah.

> P6: But my initial take on. This is, I feel it's out of place.

Tyler: Okay, tell me more about that.

> P6: So I mean, I would think that if if you're gonna ask me my name and date of birth and social security number and all of my PII, that you would just ask me my phone number and email address at the same time, I mean, that's one less screen, right? So it it is all... I would assume that it all goes together.

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:38.089

Tyler: Okay, so you're like associating this with the list that said your name, your social security number, your date of birth. All of that? Yeah, that makes sense to me. So we kind of like we went from that to the health facility. And now we're back to this sort of thing. Yeah, I see that.

Tyler: Awesome. So we won't fill this in. But can you just describe to me, is anything here jumping out at you. Does it feel straightforward to fill this in?

> P6: No, it's straightforward to fill it in? I mean, okay. It tells you exactly what it's asking for.

> P6: You know, what what if you don't have an email address though. And it says, it's required, you know, is it... I mean, we still have old Veterans right? Like it's not like not everybody's young. So you know, they might not have one.

00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:21.800

Tyler: Yeah, that's a good point. So, noticing that both of these are required, and that might work, not work for everybody. Why do you think it's asking for this information? In the first place.

> P6: So they can get in touch with you, probably to schedule an appointment or if they need to further assist.

00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:43.340

Tyler: Okay. well, let's say we typed in your phone number in your email, and then we'll click continue.

00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:48.380

> P6: Yup, here we are.

Tyler: So without clicking anything, what would you normally do on this page.

> P6: I would hit phone.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P6: Yeah, that's the easiest way to get a hold of me, you know. I do check my emails often, but you know it's I'd rather talk to somebody than get a text or an email, or whatever. I much rather talk to somebody to confirm.

Tyler: That makes sense.

00:37:19.930 --> 00:37:23.530

> P6: Text might be helpful truthfully on there, too.

Tyler: Yeah, text as an option? I can see that.

Tyler: So for today, I know this isn't what you would normally choose. But honestly, for the purpose of testing this website, we're gonna have you choose US mail.

00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:43.489

Tyler: So we'll click on US mail, and then we'll click continue.

Tyler: Alright. So now we're looking at this screen. So without clicking on anything, can you tell me what you're seeing here and what you would do.

> P6: Yeah, this is a country where you receive mail. And then it's asking me to select the country where you see your mail and a dropdown. Or if I receive my mail outside the united states on a military base. APO I suppose. I would assume. But I would just click the country where I receive my mail. But again I would probably default.

> P6: This could probably back in the PII section where they're asking my name. And you know, that sort of stuff. Because I bet you the next screen is going to tell me to put my address in.

Tyler: I guess we'll have to see! Let's put in your country. You can go ahead and click that. And then we'll continue.

Tyler: And then it looks like this matches your expectation. So we've got your street address. Is anything jumping out at you here. Anything different to how you normally fill out your address?

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.940

> P6: No, it's straightforward. I mean, don't get me wrong. This isn't bad. It's not like it's a bad system. It's like, either way.

Tyler: And then what is this page asking for?

> P6: Correct address, or to verify my address. Yeah, we can't confirm your address you entered with US postal service. And yeah, just making sure that the address is correct.

Tyler: Okay, have you seen something like this before?

00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:59.670

> P6: Yeah, I have. Because when I lived in rural Montana, I had an address that was kind of like that. There was a north side of the street, the south side of the street.

Tyler: And do you usually choose the suggestion? Or it depends on what they suggest?

> P6: I usually go with the suggestion, because that's how the postal service sees it so like just to make sure that it's right with the postal service. But it could cause a problem too, right, because it might get delivered across the street. If it's a North or a South, or you know. Or maybe they've fat fingered the address. So, you know, it could be double-edged, I guess.

Tyler: Yeah, okay, so this feels like a familiar thing. You've seen it before. You'd kinda know what you would do. And it looks like that's already selected for you. So we'll click continue.

Tyler: So without clicking anything yet just have a have a look at this page, and then I'd just love for you to describe to me this page. What's the purpose of it?

00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:07.309

> P6: I would assume to make sure that all your information that you entered is correct. And if there's anything that is not correct, you have the ability to edit, make changes. To make sure that the process goes through, as according or you know, according to plan, I suppose.

Tyler: So if you were looking at this website and I wasn't here. What would you normally do?

> P6: I mean, I probably would just hit submit questions because I would check my stuff before I submitted it on the last, on the prior pages. I would probably say most people are gonna be the same way, not go back through all of those pages of things.

> P6: But I think probably what you're looking for is me to click on the buttons, to expand, to make sure that that makes sense. (Lol).

Tyler: (Lol). So I am going to have you look at them. But it's helpful to know what you'd more likely do. So I'm gonna just have you open category and topic first, and we'll look at that one. Okay.

Tyler: Alright. So what are you seeing here?

00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:25.480

> P6: So it's just verifying everything that it asked me initially, right, what category best describes my questions, which is health care. And the topic that describes my question, audiology and hearing.

Tyler: Yeah. So that feels pretty familiar. And can we change this information?

> P6: It doesn't look like you can. I don't. I don't know. No. Wait, there's an edit button. See it now. Okay, yeah, there's an edit. But under the next one, under your question. But I don't think that that goes to the category and topic. So I can't edit the category and topic.

Tyler: Okay. Do you think you realistically, that's something you'd want to edit at this point?

00:43:10.770 --> 00:43:14.239

> P6: No, I don't. I think you're too far in. I don't think that you would.

> P6: I think that you know why you're contacting them right? Like I don't know. Yeah, that's how I feel.

> P6: I would have just backed out a long time ago.

Tyler: Is it? Is it even helpful to see what your category and topic is at this point?

> P6: I don't think so, because it's asking you, and then I know you didn't tell me to go there, but the next one is asking me, you know, what I want. So you know, again, if I directed it correctly the first time, then my question that I'm asking is going to tell you what I want, you know, or my category and topic right?

> P6: I don't know that verifying that... okay, so what if it's wrong? I can't do anything about it at this point. You know?

Tyler: That makes sense. Let's let's open personal information. And we'll look at that one.

> P6: Okay. Yeah so it gives me the ability to edit most of this stuff. Which is helpful because you could, you could get the wrong facility right like I'm sure, if you live in New York City, and there's probably numerous VA's around that area, you know, or in that Tri City area or Tri State area. Maybe you live in New York and you want to be seen in New Jersey, or maybe you live there and wanna be seen in Pennsylvania. I don't know. You know. Yeah, I think that having the ability to edit that – that makes sense.

Tyler: Yeah. Okay. So certain things you wouldn't need to edit. But there's other things where it actually is useful to be able to edit it.

Tyler: Let's let's pretend like you typed in your phone number wrong. Can you show me what you would do?

> P6: Yeah. (clicks Edit)

Tyler: So you won't be able to click any further than this. But can you describe to me, now what you would do on this screen?

> P6: Yeah, I would just update the phone number, you know, change the phone number and the phone number block and then hit update.

Tyler: Okay. And then this little section, can you tell me which fields are editable?

> P6: In the contact information? Yeah. In this specific section is just a phone number and email. And then I'm assuming you can hit the edit button underneath that and change the address if you need to.

Tyler: Right okay. Let's click on cancel. 

Tyler: And we'll just scroll down. And then at this point we'll say, we're ready to submit our question.

> P6: Okay.

00:46:07.690 --> 00:46:09.940

Tyler: And I'm just gonna give you a minute to read this.

> P6: So it's telling me I should get something in the mail in 7 days in regards to my question.

Tyler: Okay. And is there anything else any other information you're learning here?

> P6: Nothing that I'm learning. I mean, it gives me my reference number and everything. But I mean... And that I should receive an email, a confirmation email that I submitted it. Yeah, that's it. Okay.

Tyler: At this point in the process, is there anything else that you'd want to know?

> P6: No, I don't think so  Nope.

00:47:07.450 --> 00:47:18.979

Tyler: Okay. Awesome that felt pretty, clear throughout the process. Why don't you go ahead and stop sharing your screen, and we'll just take a couple of minutes. For you and I to reflect.

> P6: Stop sharing there go...

Tyler: Awesome.

Tyler: So we went through a whole bunch of steps, and I know we talked a lot through it. How did you find the process overall?

> P6: I mean, it was pretty straightforward, honestly, other than the initial screen. It was pretty straightforward. The initial screen I probably would have been trying to create a login instead of just continuing without login but other than that. It was pretty straightforward.

> P6: I think there was some things that you could have done to streamline it a little bit, you know, moving like the address and phone number, and all of that under to where it's just one screen for PII, and it's done right. Instead of, you know, you kind of bounced around a little bit in the middle there from, you know, finding a healthcare facility to going back to giving you my PII. So I just that's my thoughts on it. It wasn't frustrating, by any means. It's just like, oh, we're back to this, you know.

00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:46.740

Tyler: Yeah that makes sense. That's really helpful.

Tyler: At the beginning, like we talked about how that homepage was a little confusing, and you were like, should I sign in do you think there's any benefit to having signed in like we did? We went through that process, and you you didn't sign in? Do you think there's any benefit to signing in?

00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:51.729

> P6: I think if you were signed in, then it would probably prevent you from entering the PI stuff. Well, I would hope so right because it should know who I am, if I'm signed in. I would assume that I can set my facility that I want to be seen at if I'm signed in.

> P6: Well, depending, you know, like I said, I guess if you're somebody that's already being seen for something, or if you're a new, you know new person. You probably don't have all of that stuff yet, you know, but I don't know. Not sure what what it looks like when you sign in, I guess.

Tyler: Yeah, yeah, that's okay. But you're you're thinking that it'll be simpler, and that you might not have to put in your PI because they already know who you are. Do you think you need to review your PII?

00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:46.220

> P6: Oh, yeah, I think you should always review it just because I mean, you know, addresses change all the time. I mean. Hopefully, when I retire, I'm not moving all the time. But you know, I've moved like 23 times. So yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: And I guess if we just like step back for a second. And we think about like this process for contacting the VA. I'm sure you've contacted other organizations before, or companies, or whatever, is there anything like overall that could be done a lot better?

> P6: Compare? I don't think so. I mean honestly, if contacting the VA was that easy, as it was like I just did, then that would be awesome, right? Because I think a lot of people get frustrated with the process and give up because they're they don't want to sit on hold. Or they tell them the wrong department, you know, and it goes back to, you know, some people just don't know. They don't get it right. And you know, I'm sure if I clicked the educational benefits, and they sent me to that department they're gonna refer me to who I need to talk to. But at the same time, if I'm you know, spending an hour on hold to get sent someplace else, and then I'm sitting another hour on hold. That's gonna be pretty frustrating right? And I may just give up my hearing that important. I don't know. Right? Yeah. So it feels like if if your question ended up in the wrong place, and you were using a service like this. Hopefully, they would sort it out, and you wouldn't have to sit there waiting.

> P6: I'm assuming they would filter it like I said, through that system and get me to the right place. That's what I would thik.

00:51:25.310 --> 00:51:29.350

Tyler: How do you think they would filter it like, how would they know where to put your question?

> P6: Well, I mean right? The question that specific question was pretty targeted. I mean, if I want to get my hearing checked. it's not like you can send me to get my hearing checked. You know the ophthalmologist, you know, I can only get my hearing checked at Audiology.

> P6: There might be there. There's going to be things that obviously aren't as straightforward as hearing right like, hey? Who knows? I have kidney problems, do I have you know what's go? What's going on? Is it muscular, is it skeleton? You know there's so many different things that could factor into it. But for this specific example is very straightforward. So you know. And then you're gonna have people that just ask broad, you know, broad based questions that aren't very targeted. So the VA is probably gonna have a hard time directing them, you know. And that's on the individual, too, you know.

Tyler: Yeah. So it feels like when you're asking your question, it's important for it to be like specific and maybe detailed. So people can send it to the right place.

> P6: Yeah.

Tyler: Well, I've asked you a ton of questions. We've got a few minutes left. Do you have any questions for me? It could be about what we're doing could be about...

> P6: No, I appreciate what you guys are doing. I mean, I'm all about improving processes. So thank you for what you guys are doing. We appreciate it.

Tyler: Well, I really appreciate it. I always say, like, we wouldn't be able to do what we're doing if it wasn't for conversations like this. So I've learned a lot today. We're speaking to a bunch of Veterans over the next a couple of days to learn more from from different perspectives. So yeah, thank you so much for your time.

Tyler: Perigean, they're the folks who set up this research session. They're gonna send you a thank you note and they're gonna have some information in there for other Veterans if they want to participate in future studies. And if you have any questions, you can always let them know.

Tyler: But I yeah, I think we're all done. I hope you have a lovely rest of your day.

> P6: Thanks! Bye.
