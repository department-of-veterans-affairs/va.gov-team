# P5 - January 25, 2024

## Transcript

Tyler: Alright, the recording has started. Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio today?

> P5: Yes I am.

Tyler: Alright, we breezed through that. But before we look at the prototype, I want to get to know you and your experience with VA services a little bit better. How long have you been a Veteran?

> P5: How long have I been a Veteran? Since 1988.

Tyler: Did you start interacting with the VA right after you got out of service?

> P5: No. It was about 10 years after I got out of the service. I hadn't used any of my VA benefits up to that point. I decided to get some health care through the VA.

Tyler: So you're enrolled in health care?

> P5: Yes.

Tyler: Okay. And have you ever contacted the VA online or over the phone?

> P5: Yes. I contact the VA online a couple times a month I would guess.

Tyler: How do you usually contact them?

> P5: Through MHV. I use secure messaging online.

Tyler: Awesome. I might have some more questions for you about that, as the session continues.

> P5: If I can throw in an aside, if this is going to help logging in then I am all for it. Because to get into MHV is becoming a nightmare.

Tyler: Ah right. Yeah we won't cover that in detail today but what we'll do is, I'll save a bit of time at the end so we can talk more about sign in. I'm guessing you're talking about the way the sign in on MHV has changed, and there's different options now?

> P5: Yeah there's like 8 different options. And they intertwine and they're very, very difficult to use.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. I hear you. I don't think you're along in having that experience.

Tyler: Let's go ahead and get ourselves set up now with this prototype.

[Setting up the prototype]

3:00

> P5: I got it! Ask VA.

[Setting up screen share]

Tyler: Now I can see your screen too. I can see what you're seeing. I'm seeing a tab on your screen that says Ask VA.

Tyler: The first thing I'm hoping we can do is, you can take a moment to look at this page. And then tell me what you're noticing first.

> P5: What I notice first is sign in or create an account if you have questions about education benefits. Is there going to be a separate window like that for other benefits? Other than educational?

Tyler: That's a good question. I'm not going to answer it yet. But it sounds like you're seeing this box and it says if your question is about education, you would go here. But if you have a question about something else it's not clear where to go. Is that right?

> P5: Exactly.

Tyler: Is there anything else you can use this page for?

> P5: [You can also use this page for] account creation. If someone is not part of or signed into the VA.

Tyler: Right. So you can create an account or sign in to ask your question.

> P5: It also looks as if you need to have an account to ask a question. Which I don't agree with. It might be someone who is not eligible or has a desire to create an account, that has a question. For example, my wife might want to know something about medical or death benefits and she does not have an account. And she may not want to login on mine.

Tyler: That's a great point. So automatically a little frustrated that it seems like you need to sign in. And you thought about your wife asking a question. That's super helpful.

Tyler. For the rest of our conversation we're going to imagine that you need to ask the VA a question about how to get your hearing checked. You've recently noticed some problems with your hearing and you don't know how to get your hearing checked.

6:32

Tyler: Without clicking anything yet, can you tell me what you would do first?

> P5: Using this screen? 

Tyler: Yes please.

> P5: I would sign in to my account. And I would probably use the messenger to contact my primary care physician and ask him about scheduling a hearing test.

Tyler: So with your experience of using SM to talk to your doctor, that's where you would go. That's clear.

Tyler: Let's have a look at the rest of the page. What are you reading?

> P5: Signing for the best experience. That's the best way to do things. I'm assuming.

Tyler: What are the benefits of signing in?

> P5: It will auto fill in info if I sign in.

Tyler: Does it seem like you need to sign in?

> P5: Yes. There's a link underneath, contact without signing in. So, no, you don't have to [sign in].

8:15

Tyler: So at the very beginning, we talked about how, if you have a question about education benefits, it's pretty clear what you need to do. But your question is about getting your hearing checked, so where do you go?

> P5: I would sign in to MHV. And use SM.

Tyler: Okay. What if I said, in this pretend world, SM didn't exist, and you could only use this page. What would you do? It's okay if the answer is I don't know.

> P5: I don't know. I would call the Need help number.

Tyler: That's helpful. We're going to click on continue without signing in.

Tyler: Now we're on a new page. I'll give you a minute to look at this. And can you show me what you would do first on this page?

> P5: I would click on Category. Health care. (opens select menu).

Tyler: With this question, which category would you choose?

> P5: Health care.

Tyler: That felt pretty straightforward.

> P5: Yeah.

Tyler: How important do you think it is to answer this question correctly?

> P5: Very very. It's important because, to go through this list, this is everything available on the VA website. And I'm assuming this isn't all inclusive or this is a prototype, but, health care is the number one importance to 99% of Vets that sign in to this. Because it's something we all utilize and need.

Tyler: Why do you think it's important that you answer the question correctly?

> P5: Because you're going to go off in some other branch of the VA information site and get lost, which I have done in the past.

Tyler: Okay. It's going to lead you down a path, and you want to make sure you go down the right path?

> P5: You keep hitting continue and trying to get where you want to go and you can't get there. And then you need to start all over again which can be frustrating.

11:47

Tyler: That makes sense. Let's go ahead and click continue.

> P5: Okay, so that breaks it down.

Tyler: Are you comparing this to the last page?

> P5: Yes, this is a finer targeting than just health care. It's the health care, or areas of health care that people would ask about. And I'm assuming this is going to be a bigger list in the final version? Because there's a lot of other things that we would ask about. Pharmacy, appointments, primary care, vaccinations, I'm surprised Foreign Medical Program is even on there. There's a lot of other things that – if I was going to be drilling down through health care, I would like to see on there.

Tyler: So you interact with the VA health care quite a lot, especially using MHV. And this in comparison doesn't feel like it's covering everything. That's really good feedback. 

Tyler: With our scenario today, what would you choose on this page?

> P5: Audiology and hearing aids.

Tyler: Okay, that felt pretty quick to choose an option.

13:49

Tyler: What if you couldn't find an option to fit you needs?

> P5: Call the 800 number.

Tyler: Would you ask them your question, or would you ask them how to use this online service?

> P5: I would ask [the 1-800 number] how to find [my answer on the website]. I prefer a visual means of getting to my answer versus just hearing it. Especially if I'm hearing impaired, it would be difficult to hear on the phone.

Tyler: Okay, so you would call the 800 number hoping they would help you use this, and then you would continue online on your own?

> P5: Yeah.

Tyler: Let's choose audiology and hearing aids and we'll click continue.

Tyler: As a reminder, your question is about how to get your hearing checked. What would you do on this page?

> P5: Well I know that I qualify for having my hearing checked. So I would go my own VA benefits.

Tyler: Okay. So because you are already enrolled and qualify for this, you would choose my own VA benefits.

> P5: Yes.

Tyler: Great. And can you imagine a scenario where you choose that 2nd option, someone else's benefits?

> P5: No. I wouldn't [choose someone else's benefits]. Maybe if my wife was logging in to find something out, especially seeing how she didn't log in to an account, there, I could see her looking for that.

Tyler: What about a general question?

> P5: [A general question] would be if I wanted to – rather than speak to my doctor or my primary care – I might have a question like when are flue vaccines going to be available, which would go to the nurse not the doctor.

Tyler: Right okay. So the more specific individual will answer your question if you choose my own VA benefits, and a general question will be more 'overall.'

Tyler: Let's move on. 

Tyler: How much longer do you think the form will be, at this point?

> P5: There's 2 more sections to it. It says 2 of 4. Your question. And you have the bar on top.

Tyler: You're looking at the bar and seeing that there are 2 more bars left. So 2 more pages.

> P5: Yeah, after this one.

Tyler: That makes sense. Now let's look at this question. How would you answer this?

17:42

> P5: Is this in regards to audiology or just in general?

Tyler: Yeah, so in the scenario where you're asking about how to get your hearing checked. How would you answer this?

> P5: I have a question.

Tyler: Why is the VA asking you this?

> P5: I have no idea. I don't understand why this screen is actually there. I already clicked, on a previous screen that I have a question, or I want to know about my benefits. So yes, I do have a question. So why are you asking me this again?

Tyler: Right okay. So it feels repetitive. And maybe out of place?

> P5: Yes.

Tyler: That makes sense. If we had to ask you this question, would it make more sense to ask you at the beginning, or the end, or right now?

18:49

> P5: [This should be at the] beginning, because there's some branches that go off in different directions. If I want to say something nice about one of the nurses I had at the VA hospital, that's a good branch to have, but it doesn't really have anything to do with audiology.

Tyler: That makes sense. That's really helpful. Let's choose I have a question and continue.

Tyler: Before we look at this, how much longer do you think the form is going to be?

> P5: Well it's not 2 of 4 because I just hit continue and I'm still on 2 of 4, so I would guess it's almost done because you're getting to what is my question.

Tyler: Right, so you feel like putting your question in will be one of the last things you have to do?

> P5: Yes.

Tyler: Okay. And what would you do on this page, can you describe it to me?

> P5: I would put in a question, how do I go about getting an audiology appointment.

> P5: I don't know who I'm asking this of, is one question though.

Tyler: At this point it doesn't feel clear who you are talking to. That makes sense. And how does that impact you?

> P5: If it's somebody that's working the help desk at the VA in Washington D.C., my medical issues are not any concern of theirs. I would prefer it to go to someone who is at least part of VA health care and ideally someone who is affiliated with my local VA office or medical team.

Tyler: That's helpful. Is that something that you feel like, when you're using SM, do you know who you're speaking to when you send a message?

21:45

> P5: Yeah I know who it's going to [when I use secure messaging]. I send it to my primary care provider and all those are screened by his nurse, who answers 90% of the questions or gets things taken care of like I need a prescription renewed, and she takes you to the doctor and gets it renewed.

Tyler: Right, mhmm. And it has his name, the doctor's name, when you send your message?

> P5: Yes, it does.

Tyler: Right, okay and that's quite different to this. Where you're sending a message and you don't know who it's going to. So you're not sure how to ask your question and you also might not feel comfortable sharing everything to this unknown person.

> P5: Exactly. Yes.

Tyler: Alright, we'll pretend like we typed in your question and we'll continue.

Tyler: Can you show me what you would do on this page?

> P5: I would click I'm the Veteran.

Tyler: Always?

> P5: Yes [always].

Tyler: Why does the VA ask you this?

> P5: I don't know. If I did not click to my account, I think you shouldn't have been able to ask that question in the first place, about my medical care on the previous screen, so you're obviously not the Veteran. I can see asking this question at the very, very beginning. Right after the I'm not going to open an account or sign in. But I don't understand why this would be here now.

Tyler: Right, so similar reaction. This feels out of place. And it would be better to ask this at the beginning.

> P5: Yes.

Tyler: And you've also made an association between signing in and being the Veteran or not signing in and not being the Veteran. Is that right?

> P5: Yes.

Tyler: Okay. That's really helpful. Let's choose I'm the Veteran and continue.

24:25

Tyler: How would you answer this question?

> P5: No...?

Tyler: Why is the VA asking you this?

> P5: I don't know.

Tyler: Do you have a similar reaction to this page as to some of the others we've seen?

> P5: This one is almost intrusive. It's something that should have been asked when I signed in as a Veteran or doesn't make any sense if I didn't sign in.

Tyler: Do you feel like the way you answer this question is going to impact the service you receive?

> P5: I think it could [impact the service I receive], yes. If there's something that VA employees are specifically prohibited from doing or something, and it's something that I need, I guess that's why I'm thinking it's a little intrusive.

Tyler: That makes sense. Let's choose no and continue.

Tyler: We won't actually type on this page but let's look at the questions and I'd like to know if something stands out to you.

> P5: The first thing is why are you asking me to tell you about yourself because I either didn't sign in because I didn't want to tell you about myself, or I have an account where I had to tell you all of this to get my account open. So this feels very, very redundant and out of place.

26:40

Tyler: Right, right. Let's unpack this a little bit. There's one scenario where we didn't sign in and we don't want to give the VA all of this information, that's why we didn't sign in. And there's another scenario where we sign in and the VA should have all of our info. Let's say we signed in and the VA has all of our info. Would you expect to see this page?

> P5: [If I sign in] I expect this information to be on there. It should show when I sign in or this should be required as part of sign in.

27:30

Tyler: Right okay. So when you sign in it should have information like your first name, last name, things like that. Alright.

> P5: Yes.

Tyler: Is there anything else you're noticing?

> P5: Social security number. I would be nervous about putting that in. Because, there again, I don't know where all this information is going.

Tyler: So particularly because you haven't signed in, you're more nervous about giving your social security number.

> P5: Exactly.

Tyler: Can we talk about the SSN a little longer? It says SSN, there's also SN.

> P5: They're the same thing. I think the only people who had SN were prior to Vietnam.

Tyler: So some people will have SN and most people will have SSN.

> P5: Yeah.

> P5: Looks okay to me.

> P5: A wee bit intrusive again. Somebody's gender identity shouldn't have any bearing on VA benefits, and especially if I didn't sign in. Making my gender identity required is really kind of in your face.

Tyler: So intrusive, you haven't signed in, you don't want them to ask all of these questions about you.

Tyler: And if you had signed in, would you expect them to ask your gender?

> P5: No. Maybe pronouns, but I don't think I'd even include that either, because there again, I don't know where this information is going.

Tyler: Right, so there's this constant sort of mistrust of the service, because you're not sure who is going to see this at the end of the day.

> P5: Right. Exactly.

29:55

Tyler: That's helpful. Let's move on. We'll pretend like we filled this in and continue.

Tyler: Can you describe this to me?

> P5: Your VA health facility, search by name. 

Tyler: What's the difference between search by name and location?

> P5: By location, I know where I'm at but I don't know necessarily the name of my VA facility. I don't know whether I put in San Diego or what have you, under search by name.

Tyler: Okay, let me make sure I understand correctly. We have search by name where you might put San Diego, and search by location, what might you put there?

> P5: [Search by location] I would definitely put my home address.

Tyler: Okay. Here you put your home address and search by name might be more general, like San Diego.

> P5: Yeah.

Tyler: Right okay. (Explains prototype, how it works, what to click). Now what are we seeing?

> P5: I got a dropdown box.

Tyler: What if the health facility was called James J. Peters, what would you do on this screen?

> P5: I would highlight it and click.

Tyler: Let's go ahead and do that. Now what are we seeing?

32:20

> P5: It made that box that was selections another selection, another confirmation of that information that I picked.

Tyler: Okay, you picked one in the list and this is showing confirmation that you picked it. 

> P5: I suppose. It feels like kind of an odd way to go about it. If I clicked on James J. Peters I would expect that to load into the VA health facility box. And then click the Search, it would take me to where I'm – where continue will take me now. This screen is kind of redundant. To me, it all outta be in the health facility box.

Tyler: Right okay. So I totally see that. That's really helpful. We'll go ahead and continue now.

Tyler: Before we talk about this page, how much longer do you think this will be?

> P5: I was thinking it would be fairly short but now they're starting to ask for more information so I can see several screens after this.

Tyler: Right. So you're kind of learning that it keeps being longer than you expect...

> P5: Yes and tThey're asking for information that they either don't need or should have if I'm already signed in.

Tyler: So it feels pretty clear that at the beginning, signing in would make things a little easier for you. If you had signed in, would they be asking for your phone number and email here? Would they be showing your your phone number and email? Or they wouldn't even need to know it?

34:41 

> P5: They shouldn't even ask me. After you sign in there should be a screen that shows all the information. There's my phone number, there's my email, there's my address, my social security number.

Tyler: Okay. So they're saying, this is everything we know about you, what's your question?

> P5: Exactly.

Tyler: Right okay. So that's quite different to how this is working.

> P5: Yes.

Tyler: Okay otherwise though, does it look straightforward to put your information in this page?

> P5: Put in your phone number or put in your email address. It's just why I'm having to do that now? I could see my frustration level starting to ramp up with screens of information they should already have. I wanted to ask a question about hearing. I don't want to sit and fill in forms.

Tyler: Right, that makes total sense.

Tyler: Let's continue. Before we click anything, what do you usually choose?

> P5: Email. I might not hear the phone. And I like to see a written version of responses.

Tyler: Right. That makes sense. You use SM, it obviously has a track of responses. I can see how that works well for you.

Tyler: For today, we're going to choose US mail, this is mostly so we can test the website.

> P5: Can you click more than one on these items? It says how should we contact you, I would like it if you could send me something in the mail and via email. If I have an audiology appointment scheduled, I would get a secure messaging that we're scheduling you an audiology appointment and then I would get something in the mail that says your appointment will be on this date. I'd like to click on both.

Tyler: Right okay. And this only lets you click on one.

Tyler: How much longer do you think the form is?

> P5: A couple more pages. Because like I said, you're asking information you should already have.

Tyler: Do you think not knowing how much longer the form is would make you stop using the form?

> P5: I would not stop using it but I can see my frustration level going up. If my frustration level is going up, then some of the guys who have PTSD and going to be slamming their laptops shut and saying, to hell with you.

Tyler: Right. So already, throughout this I can see your frustration with the form is going up. And you're noticing that for other folks, that might even be worse. They might stop using the form or...

Tyler: Let's look at this page. How would you answer this?

> P5: Well I don't receive mail outside of the US. So I would click on Select. Which is kind of weird because if I don't click on I receive mail outside of the US, then obviously I receive mail in the US, so why are you asking me that.

Tyler: Right. You didn't click on the box, so the only other alternative is the United States. Cool.

> P5: Yes.

Tyler: Let's continue. Now we see your mailing address. Anything stand out?

> P5: Looks pretty straightforward.

Tyler: We'll continue. What's this page asking for?

> P5: It didn't like the address I put in so now it's suggesting another one.

Tyler: Have you seen something like this before?

> P5: I have. If their suggested address usually is like a 9 digit zip code or something, I will use that. If it's a case like this where it's identical information, I'm just going to assume you didn't like the spacing or the period or something, I'll use the suggestion. If it's not correct, I'll use mine.

Tyler: Right, so this feels familiar to you and you know what you would.

Tyler: What's the purpose of this page?

> P5: Editing your answers. If I wanted to change the information I put for personal information, if I wanted to expand or change my question and categories and topics. I don't understand what that is really going to do. Because if I was going to edit anything, I would do it before I click next. Or else I would go back to that screen.

Tyler: So you feel like if you needed to change your topic, you would have done that on the topic page or you would have clicked back while you were in the form.

> P5: Yes.

Tyler: Let's click on category and topic.

> P5: It's what I put in so.

Tyler: Okay, let's say you want to change your category. How do you change your category here?

> P5: I can't change this because it said I could only edit some answers. And clicking on it doesn't do anything. So it's not like I can click on health care and change that to burial benefits or whatever.

Tyler: Right so you saw that blue bar said you can only edit some answers, so you're assuming I guess I can't edit that one.

> P5: This has an edit box, so I can change it.

Tyler: Can you change, I'm the Veteran?

> P5: No.

Tyler: What's an example of one you can change.

> P5: [I can edit] are you currently a VA employee because it's the stuff below edit. Although the lines are kind of... I think I would put more spaces between the categories, but everything below the line out to be editable. And it's not right underneath I am the Veteran.

Tyler: Let's scroll down a little more. If you want to edit your phone number, how would you do that?

> P5: I would click edit and I would highlight it and delete and type it in correctly.

Tyler: And we talked about sections. Some are editable and some are not. What's in this section? Phone number.

> P5: And email address. And how should we contact you, US mail, is not editable. So if I change my mind and want you to send me something via email, I'm going to have start the form all over again or back through it until I get where that is and then change it.

Tyler: I see that.

Tyler: Let's click cancel and now we're going to submit your question.

Tyler: I'll give you a minute to read this. Can you tell me what you learned from this page?

47:20

> P5: I've got my reference number for my question. What would I use the reference number for?

Tyler: Good question. Why do you think they're giving you a reference number?

> P5: I don't know.

Tyler: Anything else you're learning.

> P5: I'm going to get a reply within 7 days in the mail. I'll also receive an email confirmation. What's the confirmation? Is it yes you have my question or here's your information. I guess I asked for it in mail...

Tyler: Okay, so you're getting an email. But it might be different to what you're getting in the mail?

> P5: Yes.

Tyler: Anything that's missing?

> P5: Who it went to. 

Tyler: We talked about that a little before. Can you remind me why it's important to know who it went to?

> P5: [Who it went to] is important because oftentimes it's health care information and it has a SSN in it, so both cyber security and HIPPA would come in, that information isn't to be going to whoever. I'd like to know where it went.

Tyler: It's almost more than peace of mind. It's about security, trust. And right now you don't actually know what's happening.

> P5: I'm assuming you're a researcher and not an employee of the VA. But you've to understand that the vast percentage, I'm talking 99 percentile, do not trust the VA. And the less information we can give you to get our benefits, the better. And when you start asking questions like, requiring you to give us your SSN again, it almost seems like we're getting phished by the US government.

Tyler: Right. Just another reason to distrust the process.

Tyler: [Helps stop sharing screen]

Tyler: One reflection of this session is the VA is asking a lot from you but they're not giving you much information about what's going on. And that's very frustrating for you.

Tyler: I want to come back to your experience of using secure messaging. Because in some ways, these services are very similar. You need to communicate with the VA and ask a question.

Tyler: Can you tell me some ways that this service, Ask VA, could be more similar or different to secure messaging?

> P5: This seems – I guess I would say iIt's almost a balance of power thing. The VA requires me to give all these little blocks of information that are required. But they aren't required to give anything back. Whereas, on secure messaging, I'm asking a known person or at least agency, like my primary care physician's office, a question. It feels more human.

Tyler: And one of the reason it feels more human is because you know who that person is. ... And here you just don't know who you're talking to at all. That feels very different.

Tyler: Is there anything else... We talked a little about some of the questions in the form that feel unnecessary. Is there anything else you feel could be easier?

> P5: If I chose not to sign in, I would expect a lot of those screens not to exist. If I started an account and therefore signed in, I would expect that information to already be linked to my question. So if someone wanted to get that information about me, it would be tied to the question.

Tyler: The way you laid that out is super clear. That's really helpful.

Tyler: Do you have any questions for me at this point? We can talk about sign in if you want to air your frustration for a few minutes.

> P5: Lol! I won't dump sign in on you. It's difficult. Some of the options and the things you have to do to sign in to VA health care, especially MHV, it's frustrating because you can do the same thing 3 time and the 4th time it won't work. 

Tyler: Which sign in do you use?

> P5: ID.gov. I think that's it.

Tyler: Have you noticed that it's changed? Is that part of where your frustration has come from?

> P5: Yes it is. It used to be that it was on my server or browser, and when I clicked on the icon on my screen for VA it would load my name and my password and I'd click connect and be on MHV. Now I need to jump through a bunch of flaming hoops every time and make sure my cellphone is by me because you're going to send me a confirmation magical number that I need to put in.

Tyler: Do you get a sense of why the VA has changed that?

> P5: I think it's security wise. But I don't see how it really accomplishes that. Because it's not a secure protocol – just because you sent somebody an email or a text message, is not making it secure. It's an extra hurdle. And I know sometimes I feel, and a lot of other people feel, gee they made it even more difficult to access our benefits.

Tyler: I've heard this from many Veterans, so I know that it's a frustration. I know that the VA knows it's a frustration. It's a complex problem, but there are people who are trying to make it better. It's a headache in the meantime. But thank you for sharing that with me.

Tyler: We're at time now so I don't want to keep you any longer... [Wrap up, Perigean thank you note, etc.]

Tyler: Thank you! Have a lovely day.

> P5: Thank you very much!
