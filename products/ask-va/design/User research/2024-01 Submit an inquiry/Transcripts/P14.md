# P14 - January 30, 2024

## Transcript

Becky: Alright. So I've started recording. And I'd like to confirm again, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

> P14: Yes.

Becky: perfect. Alright. So it looks like we are ready to get started. So just a couple of quick questions at the beginning for us to just learn more about your experience with Va and our online services.

Becky: So first off, how long have you been a veteran?

> P14: Since 1987. (full date redacted)

Becky: Oh, that's amazing. You've remembered the date exactly as well.

Becky: Have you ever contacted Va online or over the phone?

> P14: Both

Becky: got it? And why did you contact the V online? Or can you tell me about the time when you contacted Va online?

> P14: I was in the using the chat box when the chat box when that was coming out, to get the status of my claims. Yeah.

Becky: to get the status of your claims and have you ever done this over the phone as well?

> P14: Yes. I well, I had to. Yeah. I had to call that 800 number to get the status of my disabilities.

Becky: Got it? Yeah, it's interesting to hear you've used both the online chat on. Then also the phone, too. That's really helpful to understand.

Becky: Alright, so those were just some quick questions to learn more about your experience in general and next, I'd like to share some ideas in that prototype I mentioned earlier to get your feedback.

Becky: So in the chat I'm going to send you a link to the prototype. And I mentioned earlier earlier that this is like a test version of the website. So it's not gonna work perfectly. But you can click around in some ways. And this is a way to help us learn what we need to improve before we share it with more people.

[Screen sharing, turning off video becuase of bandwidth]

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:30.959

Becky: so now, we're going to i'll see some questions about the prototype. So I'll just give you a a few minutes or a moment to look at this page, and then, as you're looking through it and feel free to scroll scroll around, too. Can you tell me what you notice first on this page?

> P14: Oh, that you gotta sign in. Well, it tells you if it's about education work study. I did gotta sign in. Yeah.

Becky: got it. So sounds like you're you're clinging into this the screen box here. And why does that stand out to you?

> P14: Because that's what you always have to do to get onto the Va, any website they have, you gotta sign in or create an account.

Becky: Yeah, that makes sense. That you're clueing into the the signing in from maybe a past experience you've had with with the VA website.

> P14: Yeah. And that's why I do it for my phone. Cause you have to do that, you just it hit in it and do face ID. And, yeah.

Becky: That's really helpful to understand.

Becky: So for the rest of our conversation, I'd like you to pretend that in this scenario you need to ask the VA a question. So let's say that you recently noticed some problems with your hearing, and you want to ask Va. How to get your hearing checked by an audiologist. So keeping in mind that you have a question about getting your hearing checked without clicking anything just yet. Can you tell me what you would do first on this page.

> P14: Well, only well, I can't see the whole page. So.

Becky: oh, you can. You can scroll around if that helps.

Becky: I just wanted to understand what you would do first if you had a question about getting your hearing checked.

> P14: If I had a question about it. I guess I would click the search and look for. But I'll make, you know you can't ask a question on here about send an appointment for audiology. You gotta log in to do it, or you've got a call, so I don't know what the purpose of this site would do for that.

00:08:52.310 --> 00:09:00.180

Becky: Hmm, gotcha, yeah, that's really interesting that maybe you would search for your answer first, or sign in, or call.

Becky: And just reading through this page further, do you see any other benefits to signing in?

> P14: I mean you would have to sign in to look at anything that pertains to you. Because if you don't sign, you don't see anything that pertains to you. You just see like general questions, you can type in a search box and hope it comes back to you. But usually I don't do that cause I don't have time to to waste to be doing it. So I just call or sign in.

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:49.510

Becky: Hmm, so it sounds like from your perspective. You need to sign in to ask maybe more specific questions. And just searching around is is going to waste time.

> P14: Yeah. Cause usually, when you do the search, it comes back and tell you you need to sign, anyway.

Becky: yeah, exactly that that makes sense to me. So just for the session today, we're going to actually click, continue without signing in which is further down the page. So it'll be a link that you can click here. So it seems like it. It wasn't apparent that you could ask a question without signing in, which is fine. It's just further up under the button, a little hidden there. Oh, continue without signing in. Okay, here we go. Yes, okay.

> P14: alrighty.

Becky: Alright. So we're on this new page and again, I mentioned earlier. We're pretending, like you need to ask VA question about how to get your hearing checked. yeah, can you show me what you would do first? I see you're already hovering over? that box there.

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:54.379

> P14: Go here. And I would – let me see º education, disability comp, healthcare.

Becky: Got it. Sorry you're breaking up a little before then. What were you saying there?

> P14: I was clicking on the box to see if it's in here. So in there was healthcare, so I guess that would be the category.

> P14: Because since that's on the VA, that's the only category now. Won't even let me click in the box now.

Becky: Got it. And yeah, that might be the prototype talking here. But it sounds like you're looking, maybe, for audiology. But then you selected healthcare here. How important do you think it is to answer this question correctly?

> P14: Hmm.

> P14: Well, I mean, it's just taking you through extra step, I mean, cause you're not, obviously you can't get straight to whatever specialty you're trying to get to. You gotta click on all these categories and then, and hope that the next one will take you to the sub category, and... that's too much.

Becky: got it. And what? And why? Do you think it's too much? I'm curious about that.

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:24.070

> P14: Because well, because you don't really know if this gonna take you to where you needed to go.

Becky: Got it. So it sounds like you're at this point. You're a little uncertain on what's gonna happen next? So let's go ahead and click. Continue to see what's on the next page.

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:44.070

Becky: Alright. Now, can you show me what you do on this page.

> P14: Okay. So I'm gonna do hearing. I'll do audiology and hearing aids.

Becky: alright. And how do you think this question is different from the last one that you answered.

> P14: Oh, it just taking you. It took you from the main category to the sub category. So I mean this, that breaks it down is probably gonna either give you the answer or break it down to something smaller.

> P14: And, I would never do this, but I'll do it for this.

Becky: Got it? Well, why would you never do this?

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:30.739

> P14: Because, like I said, it's taking you through all of these different categories. But I know I need to make an appointment. I'm gonna call and make an appointment.

> P14: Or I'm going to sign in and do it through the site. I'm not going through no topics and all that stuff. No.

> P14: Cause first of all you gotta be on hold forever with the VA anyway. So all extra time. Nope. It's not happening.

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:58.630

Becky: Yeah. So it seems like at this point. It seems like, a long process.

> P14: Yes, it is. Yes.

Becky: yeah. I'm curious. What if you had a different question. So what if you had a question about a new law that was passed. Would you use this tool to answer that sort of question, or just a different question?

> P14: Hmm. But I use this particular thing, this one?

Becky: Yes, just from what you've seen so far.

> P14: If I wanted to know, yeah, I would just probably put it in the search.

> P14: But actually, I probably not. I probably would just Google it, because Google will give you the answer faster than going through this. I'll probably Google it. That's what I did for the PACT act.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.879

Becky: yeah, no, that's really helpful to understand just your other methods. You would take to get your question answered. alright. So, just moving through this flow, you've selected audiology and hearing aids go ahead and select. Continue.

Becky: And now, can you show me what you would do on this page?

> P14: Okay, this one, my own benefits. Because, like I said, I need to make an appointment, so it would be my own.

Becky: Got it so sounds like because you need to make an appointment. Then you would choose my own benefits. Can you talk through some, maybe some other cases where you would choose where you might choose someone else's BA benefits? Or it's a general question.

> P14: Okay, I would choose someone else's VA benefits if I was looking at my father.

Becky: Got it. And when would you choose It's a general question.

> P14: Never. Because I don't have no general question for this.

Becky: Alright. No, that makes sense. So you've chosen my own Va Benefits. Let's go ahead and click. and before clicking on anything. How much longer do you think this form is? How much longer do you think the form is to complete at this point.

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:40.909

> P14: Well, we done did a lot of clicking, and we just on 2 or 4, so I would think we got 2 more, but we probably got more than 2 more.

Becky: Got it all right. Well, we'll see if your instincts are correct. I see you notice the the 2 of 4 right at the top.

> P14: Yes, and we've done. We've more than twice, so I don't know what that part as well, I guess it waits until you get into the actual meaning of what you wanna do before it starts counting.

Becky: So it sounds like, maybe you're unclear on how the the numbers are changing right now at the top.

> P14: Yes.

Becky: got it. That that makes sense to me. Like you said you've been doing a lot of clicking, and it says 2 or 4. So you know something's not adding up there. Can you tell me what you do on this page. Now, considering your again, your scenario is, you want to get your hearing checked

> P14: I guess I have a question. That's the only thing that makes sense. Which I don't have a question. It's not a question. It's about making an appointment. That's not a question.

Becky: So are you saying you're or let let me know if this sounds right. Are you saying you're choosing? I have question because you don't see I have an appointment. Maybe?

> P14: Right. I don't see anything else that fits the category. So I mean, okay, say something nice, complaint, make about some suggestion. A town hall. I want to say something else.

Becky: So you're just trying to find the the option that fits the best.

> P14: Yes.

Becky: got it. And and why do you think Va is asking you this question right now.

179> P14: because they wanna provide the instructions to you.

Becky: Okay. that makes sense. Let's go ahead and click. I have a question, and then we'll hit. Continue.

Becky: So again, you're you're gonna find. This is, gonna be pretty repetitive. But without clicking anything. Can you tell me what you do on this page as you're looking at it.

> P14: Put your question in, which I don't have a question, but I guess I'll put the question in.

Becky: yeah, why do you say you don't have a question in this scenario?

> P14: Because you said you supposed to be clicking on it to make an appointment, not to see how to make an appointment.

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:33.530

Becky: Got it so what would you do on this page if you need to make an appointment.

> P14: I guess I would ask the question, how do you make an appointment for audiology, which is dumb, but.

Becky: got it. So you just type in that question.

> P14: Yes.

Becky: alright. So we can actually type anything into the box using this prototype. But we'll pretend, like you type in the question about what you mentioned before. How can I get an appointment to get my hearing checked or audiology? And we'll just hit Continue.

> P14: Oh, they finally moved to number 3 after. Oh, wow, okay.

Becky: Yes, yes. So have you been keeping track of the the bar at the top?

Becky: Alright.

Becky: Well, yeah. So we we moved into 3 or 4 now and again, without clicking on anything described to me what you do on this page here, after reading through the question.

> P14: Okay, I'm the veteran. So I would choose I'm the veteran.

Becky: Alright, so can you tell me why you think Va is asking you this question here.

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:58.489

> P14: So wait. Well. I don't know. I guess they just want to know who doing it or something. I don't know.

Becky: no, that's fair that maybe it's not. You're not clear on the exact reason why, but maybe it sounds like they want to know who's filling out the form that's your. Is that your best? Guess

> P14: Yes. And who you filling the form for.

> P14: So being that it's me ,it'll be I'm the veteran. But if I was doing it for my father I'd put, I'm a family member of the Veteran.

Becky: got it. Yeah, it sounds like you. You see the distinction between the 2 options. Here.

Becky: let's go ahead in this scenario and choose. I'm the veteran and hit continue, since you're trying to get your your hearing chat.

Becky: Okay? And just to confirm on that last question, too, is is your dad, also a Veteran?

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.000

> P14: Yes. And I'm his power of attorney. So I do this all the time for him and me.

Becky: Oh, okay, that that relationships clearer I wasn't sure. So I just wanted to make sure.

Becky: alright and same question here, what would you do? And why is they asking you this question?

> P14: You know I would say I would answer, no, but I don't know why they're asking this because it doesn't matter whether you work there or not, you still should get the same answer. That's why I know I wouldn't use this.

00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:51.940

Becky: Yeah, that's that's an interesting perspective. So you're not sure why they would ask you this question.

> P14: No.

> P14: they've never asked me this question. All my years they've never asked me if I worked at a VA.

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:12.620

Becky: Oh, okay. So in other experiences, this. So this is a new question that you haven't had asked asked of you before.

> P14: Correct.

Becky: Okay, no, that's really interesting to to hear about. So that's why maybe this question is sort of throwing you off here.

Becky: In the scenario. You you're not the Va employee, so let's go ahead and select no, and hit. Continue

Becky: alright. So on this page there are. You'll see there are a lot of different fields, and we're not gonna actually type anything in here but instead, take a look at all the questions. And I'd like to know if any question stands out to you.

> P14: No.

Becky: alright and looking through all the questions, is there any information that you would not like to give to Va. Just after looking through all the questions, is there anything that you wouldn't want to provide in this form or send to the VA? Or are you comfortable with completing everything and and giving all this? Information that that the form is asking for?

> P14: Oh, yeah. Yeah.

Becky: oh, sorry. Could you repeat that? I think you you broke up a little.

> P14: Yes.

Becky: Alright and looking at one of the fields up above, around social security. I noticed that it asks for social security or service number. What do you think that means there.

> P14: Oh, yeah. Cause some people got a service number for people that's like Vietnam and all that kind of stuff way back when they got service numbers. Some people do.

Becky: got it. And in this case, does it seem like you'd provide both of the numbers or just one of the numbers.

> P14: Just one cause. I don't have a service number.

Becky: Got it. So it sounds like you. You understand the difference between social security number and service number.

Becky: alright. So we'll pretend, like you filled in the information on this page and hit continue.

> P14: Hello, okay, hit continue.

Becky: Thank you.

Becky: And can you describe this new page that you're on right now.

> P14: Okay, facility. You gotta put in a VA here.

Becky: And what do you think? Search by name means, and search by location?

> P14: You either can put in the name of the facility or the location of the facility I would think.

Becky: Got it. And just in your personal experience. What would you do first to search for your health facility here?

00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:43.879

> P14: I'm putting a name, because I know the name.

Becky: Okay? And and how do you know the name? Is that just because you've been there before, or you've had previous experience.

> P14: Yeah, cause I go there all the time I go to the same one. We only have one.

Becky: got it. Okay. that makes sense to me. So for today, we're just going to pretend like your health facility. It starts with the word James.

Becky: And again, we can't type. But if you click inside the box. We'll pretend that you typed in the word, James, since you know your health facility, James.

> P14: And what are you seeing here now on all the different facilities that start with the word James.

Becky: alright. And let's take it one step further. Let's say your health facility is called James J. Peters. Can you show me what you do next? Here.

> P14: James J. Peters. click it.

Becky: alright. So it sounds like, or just repeating back what you did. You click, James J. Peters. And now the it's showing up here is selected.

Becky: Can you show me what you do next on this page?

> P14: Continue

Becky: right. And just curious. What is the name of your facility that you usually go to?

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:08.060

> P14: (Redacted: Entire, full name of VA medical center)

Becky: Yes, okay, got it/

Becky: cool. Yeah. Just curious on how you how you remember the name of your facility, since I know the names can be pretty long, and and can also change too. So it's really interesting to to hear.

Becky: Alright. So now on this page, I just wanna check in and and pause for a second. How much longer do you think this form is? At this point?

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:45.710

> P14: It has to be longer, because all those questions we still own number 3. I got it. Okay.

Becky: you've done. You've done a lot of clicks. and it's still on Number 3.

Becky: yeah. And if you compare this form to similar ones that you filled out in the past? Does it feel longer, shorter, the same?

> P14: longer.

Becky: longer? Okay?

Becky: And what? Curious? On? What type of forms are you thinking about, or are you comparing this form to?

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:22.389

> P14: What this form is, just to ask a question? I mean, why would you go through all this to ask the question? You could pick up the phone and call somebody? I wouldn't need it at all.

> P14: All we doing is trying to make an appointment. I mean you giving all this, and they even got to the appointment page. Yet.

Becky: So you think the the form is longer than previous ones, and then that there are there might be faster ways to make an appointment.

> P14: Yes.

Becky: Got it. Great. Let's let's talk about this page here. Is there anything that stands out to you on this page?

> P14: No. Needs some more information.

00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:28.860

Becky: Got it. So just some more information. Again, you can't click on the boxes. So we're just going to hit, continue and pretend like you filled in these fields.

Becky: Now on this page. Can you tell me what option you would normally choose?

> P14: Phone. Because eemails, you just gotta, you probably gonna have to go back and forth and phone is talk to somebody and get it all done at one time.

Becky: Hmm, so I'm I'm hearing a theme that you maybe prefer like a quicker resolution. And phone is usually the best way to do that in your case.  got it?

00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:16.350

Becky: Well, today, we're going to pretend like, you actually prefer getting your answer in the us, mail, so...

> P14: that would, I guess sure. No. But okay.

Becky: Got it. And why do you say that?

> P14: Well, but all these problems, the post, not delivering mail, and it takes 2 weeks to get a piece of mail. And especially from the VA. You're not gonna get it no time soon. That's definitely a no. But for this scenario. Okay.

Becky: got it. Yeah. So it sounds like it's just too long. And and you wouldn't choose us mail.

> P14: Oh. no, Umhm.

Becky: got it.

00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:54.550

Becky: Alright. Let's go ahead and click, continue and see what's on. The next page here.

> P14: Okay, and we still on number 3.

Becky: Yeah. So it seems sounds like you're still, you know, still referring to the the pro progress bar at the top there, and seeing that the numbers not changing

Becky: on this page. What would you do here?

> P14: Hmm. I guess I was just selecting and see what country they had, whether United States was in there. Oh.

Becky: alright and what do you think it means where it says, at the top I receive mail outside of the United States on a Us. Military base.

> P14: Let's see if I was on at a base that wasn't in United States. But I was overseas.

Becky: That's helpful to hear your understanding of just that check box at the top.

Becky: So for today, for today, we're just going to choose United States in the dropdown like you mentioned and hit continue.

> P14: Okay.

Becky: alright. Now, here, is there anything that stands out to you on this page?

> P14: No, I'm just asking me to put my mailing address in here.

Becky: alright. So we'll pretend like you filled in this page, you can click. Continue to get to the next one. Now.

Becky: alright, and again going to take a pause. Here. How much longer do you think the form is now?

> P14: At this rate? I don't know. I don't know.

Becky: Got it. Okay. And what makes you unsure, or or that you don't know?

> P14: Oh, because I mean, we've we went through a whole lot, and we still hadn't moved to Number 4.

> P14: So I mean. I would never do. I would never do this, never, ever.

Becky: I know that that's fair. Yeah. And it seems like you're really keeping track of that progress far, and seeing if the numbers are changing and you're not so, it makes you.

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:43.860

> P14: Yeah, cause I mean, I hate wasting time, and this I get to the end, and still don't get what you need.

Becky: Interesting? Okay, yeah. Let's Let's take a look at this page, and then we'll move on to the next one. But I do. Wanna ask you. What do you think this page is asking for here.

> P14: To make sure your address is correct. And they're saying they don't. It doesn't recognize what you put in. So it's telling you what it should be according the mail.

Becky: Got it? And understanding that, what would you do on the page?

> P14: select the one that they suggested.

Becky: Okay. And and why would you select the one they suggest, and not the one you entered?

> P14: Because, 9 times out of 10 days. What it suggested one is the right for delivery with the postal service. So.

Becky: okay, so it sounds like, you you trust what they are suggesting there, in that it's right for the postal service.

Becky: So that makes sense to me. Yeah, let's go ahead and click, continue and see what's on the next page. Can you describe what's on this page to me now?

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:37.970

> P14: Okay, so it's like, you notice, you're only gonna edit somethings on this page. And for the parts that you can't edit just go back to the other pages to correct make if you need to make corrections.

Becky: Got it. So it seems like you're you're clueing into what's in this blue box here? Can you tell me what the or what you think is the purpose of this page in general.

> P14: To verify that you put in everything correctly before you submit your question.

Becky: alright. And what would you do first on this page, understanding that.

> P14: I will expand all the category.

Becky: Okay. Go ahead.

> P14: Oh, I would explain it to see if there was some problems.

Becky: got it? And and what do you mean by problems?

> P14: Something that wasn't filled out correctly, or whatever.

Becky: Okay, got it? Got it? Thanks for clarifying.

Becky: Let's look at the category and topic box right at the top first. So how would you open that?

> P14: All right.

Becky: great. And looking at the information. Does it seem familiar to you?

> P14: Yes.

> P14: alright, it's just gonna put in.

Becky: Okay, so it's it's the information that you put in before.

> P14: So that button.

Becky: Yeah. Now let's say that you wanted to change your category. Can you update your category here? Does it seem like you can

> P14: no

Becky: got it. And what is indicating to you that you can't update it?

> P14: Because I don't see an edit button or an update or a change button.

Becky: got it? Alright. So you're not seeing like a button or an update button or a change button.

00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:29.080

Becky: Let's click on personal information next, and I'll take you, or I'll give you a minute to take a look at this section. Here.

Becky: So you're taking a look through the section. What do you think happens, if you click edit

> P14: particular category, you'll be able to make updates.

Becky: alright. And can you show me what you do to edit your phone number. Let's say, you notice the type on your phone number, and you need to change it.

> P14: A phone number. Okay? So I would click on edit by contact information.

Becky: alright. So go ahead and click the button

Becky: alright and take a moment to look at just how the screen changed.

Becky: Does it look like you can edit all of your contact information.

> P14: Just those 2, the phone number email.

Becky: Alright. And what makes you think you can edit just those 2?

Becky: Alright. No worries

> P14: Trying to remember what I last asked. Oh, I think I asked. Oh, yes, maybe well, I would make the changes that

Becky: yes. And how do you? Or why do you think you can only make changes to those 2 boxes there.

> P14: Because that's the edit that I hit, and well, those 2 boxes are the only thing that's in that area when I click the edit.

Becky: got it? And does it look like you can change your contact preference here.

> P14: Okay. How should we contact you? No, you can't change that.

Becky: It appeared after you click the edit button. So what makes you think you can't change this question here?

> P14: Oh, because they don't give you a box to make the correction.

Becky: Got it. Okay? So it sounds like the box is telling you that you can. You can update the information.

> P14: Correct.

Becky: Alright, let's go click, cancel. Let's say you actually put in your phone number correctly. So you don't actually need to update it.

Becky: And now we're ready to submit. So you can go ahead and click, submit question at the very bottom.

> P14: Submit question

Becky: Alright. Now take a minute to read this page, and then can you summarize it back to me. or just anything that you're noticing on the page?

> P14: Yeah, it said that it was submitted successfully, and it gave me a reference number. Now, it's saying, okay. you should receive a reply within the US Mail within 7 business days. Oh. Nope, okay.

00:42:50.730 --> 00:42:55.409

Becky: got it. And and why do you say that around the 7 business days?

> P14: That's too long. I mean, if you need an appointment. You got to wait 7 days to get the answer. And it's still not making an appointment.

Becky: Got it? Hmm. Let me ask you a different question. Is there any other type of question that you would be able to wait longer for, or any scenario where you would be okay with waiting longer for?

> P14: No! Well, the only thing that you that you're required to wait longer for is your disability benefits. Yes, take it could take anywhere from 2 to 3 months to years. So that's the only thing that you're required to wait, and you can't control that wait. You're just in a pile somewhere.

Becky: Got it. But if you just had just like a general question about something. would you wait, or would this wait time? Be okay with you?

> P14: Well, probably so. But I can't see me having a just a general question for the VA. Okay? If it's a general question, I will look it up. I would look it up.

Becky: got it as opposed to like a more specific question.

> P14: This this what I don't understand. There's no specific question that you cannot call the VA for and get an answer.

Becky: Got it.

> P14: So I would never complete this form and do this? Never. No. Never.

00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:50.280

Becky: And what number would you call, or who would you call? Is it the 800 number, or or another number?

> P14: No, if it was, if it's a question about an appointment, or something like that. I would call my actual VA, because this 800 number is, if you want to know about your disability, your payments. They they can't help you, for with appointments.

Becky: got it. And how would you? Look up that specific number if you needed to

> P14: If I needed to look it up?

Becky: Yeah. Or do you already remember the number?

00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:26.070
> P14: Yes (redacted: reads the full number of their VAMC)

Becky: Oh, okay, so you remember the number.

00:45:33.050 --> 00:45:41.880

> P14: Oh, yeah. Cause like, I said, we have. We have a huge VA, but it's one VA. In [City], [State], one VA. For us. That everybody goes to. And it's one phone number that everybody call. And then once you call you dial, your extension.

Becky: Okay. So yeah, sounds like, you have a lot of experience calling the number. You even remember the phone number. So you wouldn't even have to look it up at this point.

Becky: So we've we've come to the end of this form. And you've read through the the last page here. Is there anything else that you'd want to know after you submit your question.

> P14: No.

00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:44.74

Becky: Okay. So we're we're finished with the prototype you can stop sharing your screen, or or if you just want to keep it up. That's fine, too. But I'd love to spend a little time just reflecting on everything we talked about before we finish.

Becky: And you know you've already shared some of your opinions on this. But if we just think further about asking the a question online. Was there anything at all that you liked about that process?

> P14: I did not like this process at all. I did not.

Becky: got it. And and why was that?

> P14: Because it was first of all it was too lengthy to do. And at the end result not get an answer. So no. And there's nothing that you should want to know at the VA that you should have to wait for, if it's a question. You know, it's too easy to pick up the phone and call.

00:47:31.590 --> 00:47:38.589

Becky: Got it. That's really interesting, you said. There's nothing at the VA that you should have to wait for. If you have a question. why do you say that?

> P14: Because that's what they I mean. That's what they have the hundreds of workers there for. I mean, I work for the Federal government. Not the VA. But people are not gonna wait for? No, no, they're gonna pick up their phone and call me if they need something, or they need something from my people. They're gonna call me and get the answer.

Becky: Got it. And thinking about the form again, is there anything that could be easier. Besides not using the form and and calling someone. Is there just anything that could be easier within the form?

> P14: Yes, they could put more on a page than 2 things.

Becky: got it. And and why do you think that would make things easier?

> P14: Because you would, first of all, you wouldn't have to keep on clicking and going from page to page. And it's talking about one of 4, and you click 5 different pages before even moves to number 2.

Becky: got it. And you know, you mentioned contacting the online before. like, how does that experience compare to this one?

> P14: Oh, it's easy. It's a sheet, and you just fill it all out and hit. Submit. You don't go through all these little minor, page by page. You just fill out what you want to fill out and hit submit and it goes on.

Becky: Got it. And and what's the sheet you're referring to?

00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:32.969

> P14: Ant, I don't see. I don't have a specific instance. I mean, I've I just never had a something like this. You gotta go through all this thing to get something. Oh, well, and then, first of all, you could do okay. If you wanna do secure messaging you to your doctor or to audiology. You just send a message to them, and they come back with you with us.

> P14: So that's another reason why I wouldn't use this I would go straight through secure messaging, and because you can contact any department that you've dealt with. It's there, their name,  the doctor's name. Everything is there and everything's on one page. You put you put at the top. You put the provider area, or whatever area you trying to get like. If I'm trying to get audiology, I was select audiology. It'll add it. And your subject is, they got choices. Your subject is either appointment, prescriptions, general question.

> P14: You select it, you type your stuff and they respond to you within a day. If you do it early enough. They're they're respond to you before the day is over with depending on what the doctor. When the doctor finishes their patients they check them. He checks secure messaging, and they respond back to you. Or they have the nurse to do it.

Becky: Got it? So yeah, sounds like there, I'm glad you mentioned secure messaging and I don't wanna make any assumptions. So this might sound like like an obvious question. But And you mentioned all the differences. But what exactlydo you think makes it better than this experience that you just went through like you mentioned your doctor. And oh, sorry! Go ahead.

> P14: Secure messaging. It goes directly to that department, and the department looks up your information cause they have it already, and they come back to you. Like, for instance, if I go to my primary care, doctor, like I just did, because my one of my prescriptions is finished, I don't have any more refills. So I went to him. And I sent it to him, and my subject was prescription medication refill. That's one of the subjects. So I click that. And then I typed in the name of the medicine, and that all my refills was finished. And can he put in new refills. Or do I need to wait to be seen at my next appointment in April. And he'll come back, and he'll tell me whether he'll say I feel your medication, or he'll say, wait and I'll see you in April.

Becky: Got it so it sounds like you really understand the process through secure messaging to get those health care questions, answered. And I might ask this before. But maybe I'm just trying to to understand, like for other questions that don't have to do with healthcare. Would you like you mentioned Googling? Would you go to that? 800 number? for those other questions?

> P14: It would depend on my question, because, like I said, the 800 number is not there to. I mean, they're there to answer questions, but certain questions they won't answer. So you, you just know to go to the VA. To your Va. To get the answer.

> P14: When is the last day to apply under the PACT act. You could Google that. And it's out there to tell you what the date is and that it had got extended. So it's easier ways to find answers, then to like that phone? And wait 7 business days for an answer that you could have gotten 10 min. Right?

Becky: Yeah. So sounds like, maybe just in the questions that you can think of asking, just in in your personal experience that, you you might just Google. Or you know, if you have health questions, you know where to go to.

Becky: So there are no scenarios where you might want to call like the 800 number, or just unlike you mentioned using the chat bot as well. What was that scenario for?

> P14: Okay, the chat bot. It was that I wanted to know the status of my claim that I had submitted because it was showing that it was completed, but it hadn't rolled over to me actually seeing it. But I went on the chat box. It tells you that it says that they it will give you on time information.

Becky: Yeah. So it sounds like, you know about just other tools and ways to get answers quicker. So that that makes sense to me. And thanks for humoring these these questions. For me, too.

> P14: you're welcome.


Becky: Alright, so I don't have any further questions. I just wanted to thank you for sharing your time with me. It's been really helpful to learn from you, and just to go through the whole prototype and and watch you interact with it. While you know, going through your your feedback as well. So I really appreciate that and I do. Wanna ask if you have any questions for me. That you'd that you'd like answered right now.

> P14: No. I'm good.

Becky: Alright. Well, thank you so much for your time. Pera, Jean is going to send you a thank you. Note. Oh, thank you. So they're gonna send you a thank you. Note, with some information, you can pass this along to other veterans if they want to participate in future research sessions.


Becky: great. Yeah, that's it for me. I hope you have a lovely rest of your day.

> P14: You, too, thank you. Alright, thanks. Bye. bye.
