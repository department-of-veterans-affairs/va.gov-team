## Background

Ask VA (AVA) is an online portal that allows Veterans, caregivers and others to submit questions to VA and receive a secure response. Currently, AVA resides within a stand-alone Microsoft portal that is inconsistent with VA design standards, is not mobile-friendly, and has accessibility issues. 

We need to move AVA to VA.gov. It should be mobile friendly, accessible and easy to submit an issue and receive updates and information that results in a final resolution. Ultimately, we want AVA to feel part of a cohesive and user-centered approach to support. This [product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/products/ask-va-phase-1-product-outline.md) includes more details about the scope of Phase 1 of our work.

### OCTO priorities

This research supports the following OCTO FY24 priority:

* Better experiences: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.

### Veteran journey

Ask VA can support Veterans, their family members, and other submitters at many stages of the Veteran journey. They may use Ask VA when they’re separating through aging.

## Research goals

The key goals of this study are to:

* Understand how submitters find a question in their dashboard
* Understand what submitters need to learn when they review their question's details

### Outcome

This research will help us determine if and how we need to improve the design and content of Ask VA. This study will also inform future research objectives.

### Research questions

Understand how submitters find a question in their dashboard:
* Which labels or details are useful in identifying a specific question? For example, category, reference number, or date.
* Do people expect to be able to 'search' their dashboard?
* Can people find the question they're looking for?
* How does this differ if you have a few or a lot of questions in your dashboard? And/or, if you're a business submitter?
* Do the statuses and icons make sense in this context?
* Can people find the link to review the details of their inquiry?
* What do people expect to happen when they click 'Check details'?

Understand what submitters need to learn when they review their question's details:
* Can submitters successfully navigate to their question details?
* What do people notice first when they review their question details?
* Which labels or details are useful when people check their question details?
* Do people scroll down to check the reply from VA, and can they find it?
* Do submitters understand how or if they can reply back to VA?
* If they can't reply to VA, what would submitters do if they have an issue or follow-up question?

### Hypotheses

1. People will generally understand the content within the cards without labels, like, 'Date submitted.'
2. People may confuse the date submitted (H3, primary date) with the date last updated (secondary date).
3. Certain statuses and icons will be difficult to understand without more description.
4. It will be hard to identify which questions have a reply from VA.
5. People will expect to be able to search in their dashboard using keywords in the question or category.
6. People may only use the sorting feature when they have many cards.
7. It will be straightforward to find the link to check details, but some people will think they can click on the entire card.
8. On the details page, people will scroll past details to look for a reply from VA.
9. When they want to write a reply to VA, it will unintuitive to scroll back up to the reply.
10. People who can't respond to VA will be unsure what to do if they have a follow up question or issue.

## Methodology

This will be a moderated usability study conducted remotely over Zoom. We will use Figma prototypes with limited interactivity.

We will present a scenario where the submitter has already asked VA a question and is ready to check if they have a reply.

These are the main features we're testing:
- Find a question in your dashboard (Authenticated)
- Review question's details (Authenticated)

## Recruitment

### Recruitment approach

We will work with Perigean to recruit Veterans.

We will also work with the GI Bill team to recruit business submitters, such as Work study site supervisors or School Certifying Officials (SCOs). However, if we're unable to do this within our timeline, this will not be a blocker to completing this study.

### Recruitment criteria – Veterans

We will recruit 8 Veterans for a total of 6 completed sessions.

For more details about our criteria, refer to our [Recruitment ticket](add link).

|# of participants|Criteria|
|:--|:--|
|Exactly 8|Are Veterans|
|Exactly 8|Have contacted VA online or over the phone in the past year|
|Exactly 8|Have signed in to VA.gov in the past year|
|Exactly 4|Are willing to join from a mobile device|
|Exactly 4|Are willing to join from a desktop device|

*We're aiming to fill gaps in our previous studies. We've specifically called out Asian or Hispanic demographics because we haven't been able to recruit participants from these demographics in our last two studies. We want to ensure we recruit these underserved Veterans.

2. Have you signed in to VA.gov in the past year? [Yes, no]

5. Do you find it difficult to remember or learn new things, focus on a task, or make decisions? We ask this question because we want to make sure that our tools work for people who live with challenges like these. [Yes, no]

### Recruitment criteria – Business submitters

We will recruit 2 business submitters for a total of 2 completed sessions. They should join from the device they would usually use to submit Ask VA inquiries.

## Pilot sessions

Perigean does **not** need to set up our pilot sessions. Tyler will schedule and add participants herself.

### Pilot

- Pilot participant: TBD
- Date and time of pilot session: Thursday, May 23 at TBD

## Research sessions

- Length of sessions: 1 hour
- Buffer between sessions: 30 minutes
- Maximum sessions per day: 4 sessions

### Availability

We will provide 16 time slots, with the aim to book 8 sessions.

If possible, we'd like to prioritize filling earlier sessions in the schedule, first.

These time slots are for Perigean. We will schedule sessions with business submitters ourselves, separately.

**We’d also like to request that Perigean calls each participant to remind them about the session, in addition to emailing them. Please include the session time in each participant's respective time zone (from their address).**

## Appendix

We decided to remove a goal from this research study, after discussing scope with our PO. However, it's captured here in case we need to reference it in the future.

Understand whether submitters can learn the status of their inquiry without signing in:
* Can people find where to search to check their question's status without signing in?
* Do people know where to find their reference number?
* Why might people choose to check their question's status without or before signing in?
* Do the statuses, icons and descriptions make sense in this context?
* Are people aware they can sign in to review the details, if they authenticated originally?
* If available, can people make the jump from checking the status of their question (before sign in) to signing in?
