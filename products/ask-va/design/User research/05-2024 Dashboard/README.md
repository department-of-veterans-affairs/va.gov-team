# About this research

## Study
[2024-05 Ask VA: Dashboard #540](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/540)

## Background
Ask VA (AVA) is an online portal that allows Veterans, caregivers and others to submit questions to VA and receive a secure response. Currently, AVA resides within a stand-alone Microsoft portal that is inconsistent with VA design standards, is not mobile-friendly, and has accessibility issues. 

We need to move AVA to VA.gov. It should be mobile friendly, accessible and easy to submit an issue and receive updates and information that results in a final resolution. Ultimately, we want AVA to feel part of a cohesive and user-centered approach to support. This [product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/products/ask-va-phase-1-product-outline.md) includes more details about the scope of Phase 1 of our work.

## Research goals

The key goals of this study are to:

* Understand how submitters find a question in their dashboard
* Understand what submitters need to learn when they review their question's details

## Recruitment
We will work with Perigean to recruit Veterans for this research. We will also recruit business users through Perigean or the GI Bill team.

## Date

This research will take place in May-June 2024.
