## Intro (5 minutes)

> Start transcript: `LIVE TRANSCRIPT` > `ENABLE`.

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Tyler]. How are you?

I’m a researcher from VA. I work on improving VA.gov so it's easier for Veterans to contact VA online if they have a question.

**What I hope to do today** is get a sense of how we can make this process better.

**What I don't want to do** is add to any frustration that you have with contacting the VA. I want to be up front and say that I don't have a way of fixing those past experiences. But, I do want to know about your frustrations in case they're things we can improve in the future.

So before we get started, when we set up this session, we asked if you’re okay with a couple of observers joining us. This helps my team members learn from our conversation as well, and they also help me take notes so we capture everything you share.

**I want to confirm now, are you okay with a couple of my teammates joining us to observe?**

- `IF NO` Use Slack to let observers know.
- `IF YES` They're in the waiting room, so I'm going to let them into the meeting now.

> Let in observers from the waiting room.

Welcome. Can everyone say hello? This is `PARTICIPANT`.

**Thanks everyone, now I’ll ask you to turn off your cameras and mute yourselves for the rest of the session.**

There are a few other things I want to mention before we start:

- **This session should take about an hour.** I’ll make sure we finish on time, so I may occasionally move us along during the session, so we can cover everything.
- **We’re here to learn your honest opinions.** Negative feedback is helpful too, because it helps us learn how we can improve.
- **I also want to make it clear that we’re not testing your ability.** So, for example, if I ask if you understand something, it’s because I want to make sure writing is clear.
- **I’m going to share a prototype with you today.** This is like a test version of the website, so it may not work exactly how you expect. For example, you’ll be able to click some buttons, but not all of them. Also, if the prototype says something like, "you have a 70% disability rating," that's pretend information. I don't want it to alarm you if you read anything, because it's all just made up for the purpose of this session.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, you just have to let me know.** And that might be a pause to get some water or to stop the session completely. You'll be paid even if we don't complete the full session.
- Last thing is about recordings. We can record the session to help us confirm we captured your opinions accurately and sometimes share video clips with our colleagues at VA. If we do this, we don’t link anything you share in the session to any information that could identify you. We remove your face and your name from the videos. **Knowing this, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
  - `IF NO` Don't record
  - `IF YES` Once I start recording, I’ll confirm again.

> Start recording: `RECORD TO CLOUD`.

I’ve started recording. I'd like to confirm again: **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?**

## Warm up (5 minutes)

It seems like we’re ready to get started. I'd like to begin by learning more about your experience with the VA and our online services.

- First off, can you tell me about your title and role at VA?
- Have you used Ask VA before?
    - Can you tell me some reasons you use Ask VA?
    - Why do you use Ask VA vs. another tool or task?
    - How often do you submit inquiries?
    - Do you use Ask VA on your computer or phone?
- Are you a Veteran yourself?
    - `IF YES` Have you used Ask VA to submit an inquiry about your own benefits?

## Set up (5 minutes)

Thanks, it’s helpful to learn about your experience with the VA.

Now, we're going to shift gears. And I'd like to share something and get your feedback.

In the Zoom chat, I'm going to send you a link to a prototype. I mentioned earlier a prototype is like a test version of a website. It might not work perfectly, but this way we can learn what we need to improve before we share it with more people.

> Send link in Zoom chat.

* [BUSINESS - Desktop prototype](add link)

- Can you open the link in the chat?
- Have you shared your screen on Zoom before?
  - `IF YES` Great. Can you please share your screen?
  - `IF NO` I’ll walk you through how to do that…

Thanks! Now I’m able to see your screen too.

> Screen: Dashboard

Okay, so before we look at this, I want to explain the scenario.

We're going to pretend like you've signed into VA.gov to check on a recent Ask VA inquiry you submitted.

And so, take a look at your screen now. We see that we're on Ask VA and we're pretending like you're signed in. This is your account.

- How does that sound? Does everything feel clear at this point?

Okay, great. If you have any questions as we go along, just let me know.

## Dashboard (20 minutes)

So, first off...

- Can you describe this page to me? What are you noticing?
- How do you usually use your Ask VA dashboard?
- Is there anything you look for in particular?
- As a `ROLE`, do you often go back into your dashboard to look at the VA's reply?

Great. I'll let you know when we can click on things, but for now let's stay on this page.

So, let's say you received an email from the VA letting you know that they've replied to your question. And so, you've signed into your account today in order to read their response.

- So, you know from your email, that the VA has replied to one of your questions. Which question have they replied to?
  - Describe to me what you're looking for. How would you find which question to click on?
- What does the date mean? What day is that referring to?
- What does this mean, where it says, "Education benefits and work study"?
- What does 'new' mean?
- What does 'solved' mean?
- What's different about this, compared to the current Ask VA?
- Why does it say business at the top?
  - What is the difference between business and personal inquiries?

`IF VETERAN` Since you're a Veteran, let's go ahead and click on the personal tab.
- Is there anything you want to point out here?
- Okay, let's return to the business tab.

Okay, so at this point, you think you've found the question you're looking for. Which is the `Solved` question you asked on May 8th.

- Without clicking yet, can you tell me where you would click next?
- What do you expect to happen when you click 'Check details'?

## Question details (20 minutes)

Alright, so now we're on this page.

- First, can you describe this page to me? What are you noticing?
- Is this what you expect to find on this page?
- Is anything missing?

Remembering our scenario...

- What would you do first on this page?
- Can you find the reponse from the VA?

I'll give you a minute to read their reply.

- What are your thoughts, after reading this?
- Is their reply what you expected?
- If you had a follow-up question, can you reply back to the VA?
- Let's say for a minute that you couldn't reply back to the VA, what would you do to follow up?

<details>
  <summary>Key things to notice</summary>

- Do they understand how or if they can reply back to VA?
- If they can't reply to VA, what would they do if they have an issue or follow-up question?

## Cool down (5 minutes)

Okay, we’re all finished with the prototype. So you can stop sharing your screen now.

> Stop sharing screen

I’d love to spend a little time reflecting before we finish.

- What did you think of that process?
- How does this compare to the current Ask VA that you use?
- Is there anything you like better about this version?
- Is there anything missing from this version?
- Do you ever need to reply back to the VA when you send an inquiry?
- Is there anything else you want to share with me, about this process?

<details>
  <summary>Key things to notice</summary>
  
- What did they like and what would they change?
- How does this compare to the current version that they're used to?

</details>
   
Well, I think you've answered all of my questions.

Thanks again for sharing your time with me. It’s been so helpful to learn from you.

**Do you have any questions for me?**

Okay, well thank you so much for the time. We really value the feedback we receive from users and you've given us a lot to think about.

I hope you have a lovely rest of the day.

## Pause or exit strategies

We can use this strategies to prepare for difficult situations.

### If the participant isn't feeling well

I'm sorry you're [not feeling well]. Do you feel up for continuing? You'll be paid even if we stop early.

> If they choose to continue...

Okay, just let me know if you change your mind.

### If the participant is showing signs of upset or distress

This sounds so hard. Would you like to take a break or stop?

> If they choose to take a break and come back...

Welcome back. I'm interested to hear more about [topic you left off on]. Are you up for continuing or would you prefer we move to the next topic?

### If the participant decides to stop

Thank you for your time today, I completely understand your decision to stop.

> If they seem distressed...

Before you go, the VA Hotline number is 988, it's a confidential helpline, and it's 24/7. It's up to you whether you call.

### If the participant is fine to continue, but you aren't

I hear that you're okay to continue. Before we do, I realized that I need a minute. I'm going to turn off my camera and microphone, and get a glass of water. Is that okay with you? I'll be back in 3 minutes.

> If you're still not able to continue, after you pause...

Thanks for letting me take a break. You didn't do anything wrong, but I'm realizing that I'm not going to be able to continue this session. You will still be paid for the full time. I really appreciate you sharing with me today. Is it okay with you if we stop? Thanks very much.
