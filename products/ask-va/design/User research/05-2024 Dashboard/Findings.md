## Research goals

The key goals of this study are to:

* Understand how submitters find a question in their dashboard
* Understand what submitters need to learn when they review their question's details

## Research questions

Understand how submitters find a question in their dashboard:
* Which labels or details are useful in identifying a specific question? For example, category, reference number, or date.
* Do people expect to be able to 'search' their dashboard?
* Can people find the question they're looking for?
* How does this differ if you have a few or a lot of questions in your dashboard? And/or, if you're a business submitter?
* Do the statuses and icons make sense in this context?
* Can people find the link to review the details of their inquiry?
* What do people expect to happen when they click 'Check details'?

Understand what submitters need to learn when they review their question's details:
* Can submitters successfully navigate to their question details?
* What do people notice first when they review their question details?
* Which labels or details are useful when people check their question details?
* Do people scroll down to check the reply from VA, and can they find it?
* Do submitters understand how or if they can reply back to VA?
* If they can't reply to VA, what would submitters do if they have an issue or follow-up question?

## Methodology 

This will be a moderated usability study conducted remotely over Zoom. We will use Figma prototypes with limited interactivity.

We will present a scenario where the submitter has already asked VA a question and is ready to check if they have a reply.

These are the main features we're testing:
- Find a question in your dashboard (Authenticated)
- Review question's details (Authenticated)

## Hypotheses and conclusions

|Hypothesis|Conclusion|Explanation|
|:--|:--|:--|
|People will generally understand the content within the cards without labels, like, 'Date submitted.'|Definitely True|People understood each item without further description.|
|People may confuse the date submitted (H3, primary date) with the date last updated (secondary date) especially with date sorting.|Somewhat True|Dates were sometimes confused, particularly if they were similar across cards or if people were comparing date sent and date submitted.|
|Certain statuses and icons will be difficult to understand without more description.|Likely False|People generally understood statuses without further description and there was little mention of icons.|
|It will be hard to identify which questions have a reply from VA.|Definitely False|People assumed 'Solved' questions have a reply from VA.|
|People will expect to be able to search in their dashboard using keywords in the question or category.|Definitely True|People mentioned searching using keywords and relied on skimming the categories and questions when looking for particular content.|
|People may only use the sorting feature when they have many cards.|Definitely True|Although people only had 3-4 cards in their dashboard, they could imagine using the sorting feature if they had many more inquiries to look through.|
|It will be straightforward to find the link to check details, but some people will think they can click on the entire card or that it will open additional details on the same page.|Likely False|It was straightforward to find the link but people were not confused that the link opens a new page.|
|On the details page, people will scroll past details to look for a reply from VA.|Definitely True|Everyone scrolled past the details looking for the reply, or, they didn't scroll and were confused where the reply was.|
|The sequence of the page will feel unintuitive, with people scrolling around to read VA's reply, their question and their reply to VA.|Definitely True|People scrolled back and forth between top of the page (question) and bottom of the page (reply from VA).|
|People who can't respond to VA will call or submit a new question if they have a follow up question or issue.|Likely True|It's likely that people will call (and that's when they mention they may use their reference number) but this was touched on lightly during research.|

## Key findings

1. People use last updated date and status to find items that have a reply or should have a reply soon.
2. Question and category provide keywords that help people skim and identify particular items.
3. Education business submitters organize their inquiries by student name.
4. It can be confusing deciphering between new and in progress, but reopened and solved are well understood.
5. There's an expectation that inquiries marked as solved by VA will not actually feel solved for Veterans.
6. It's more intuitive to read and save a conversation that's in chronological order.

## Details of findings 

### Finding 1: People use last updated date and status to find items that have a reply or should have a reply soon.

_Labels: `AUD: Veterans`, `PRDT: AVA`_

Tracking dates is important because people expect delays from VA and, for business submitters, need to ensure compliance.

However, multiple similar dates can be confusing.

People primarily focus on 'last updated' date and status to determine if a question has been answered or when to expect a reply. 

> "Last updated would let me know if you've done anything on it, like, I use the claims portion of the VA website, and that lets me know if they've worked on it."

> "I put a date and a time that I submitted it and then they know, I did it, this when I did it. This is the date I did it. If anybody asks, you know."

> "We're trying to check the status [to know] how much longer it's gonna be before they work on it [...] and [they're] doing it in a timely manner."

> "[Date at the top is] when it was submitted. But a little bit of a question mark [...] because then there's multiple dates shown elsewhere..."

### Finding 2: Question and category provide keywords that help people skim and identify particular items.

_Labels: `AUD: Veterans`, `PRDT: AVA`_

People would prefer to search for items using category labels or keywords.

Also, skimming questions written verbatim helps in identifying items.

This is particularly useful when someone is trying to recall a past question. For example, to re-read the response from VA or to check whether they've already asked before they submit a new question.

> "If I know what I'm looking for a response [to], I might not remember the date I sent the request. But, I'll know what I asked the question about. So it's easier to find an answer that I'm looking for."

> "If I have many questions [...] for some reason there's no filter up in the top to filter for the category. I would be annoyed there's no filter [for category] [...] Last updated, I don't think I would use that to find it."

> "There [could] be a way to sort just the healthcare stuff, and I could look through that and see, okay, I was asking about disability here. I was asking about renal failure here. Because you could read your question."

> "Let's see, [the question says] time card attached so that [must] be a work study submission."

### Finding 3: Education business submitters organize their inquiries by student name.

_Labels: `PRDT: AVA`_

Education business users use student names to match Ask VA questions to their paper or digital case folder.

Some business submitters use the reference number to distinguish between and recall items. Most people, however, don't use the reference number much. It may only become useful if they need to call VA to follow up.

> "For submitting a time sheet [...] last name. I might include the word  timesheet or time card. I might put the month and date on there for my own purposes. So I know when I'm submitting it."

> "It feels like pointing out the obvious, but yes, I would need to know who I was asking about [to match a question to a case folder]."

> "I feel like [the reference number is] just a tracking mechanism. I don't [use the reference number]."

> "We'll do a screenshot of that 'A number' and then we put it with that file so we know what the number is in association to what file we're submitting. Whether I've the SCO hat on or work study."

### Finding 4: It can be confusing deciphering between new and in progress, but reopened and solved are well understood.

_Labels: `AUD: Veterans`, `PRDT: AVA`_

Veterans use the claims process to understand Ask VA statuses. This mental model is reference often and helps people know what to expect.

'In progress' is generally understood as, "they're working on it."

But, 'New' is hard to distinguish from 'In progress.' In some cases, people think 'New' means they have a new reply.

'Reopened' is well understood and it gives people peace of mind knowing their question can be opened again.

> "So you probably have like 5 or 6 of those [statuses]. So, new, solved, under review, or something like that. Ways for a person to kind of know, where's that in the queue."

> "In progress, they've read it, and they're working on a response."

> "I don't know if 'New' means, if that's a new question that I created, or if that means I've got a new reply from back from the VA."

> "I'm just curious about 'New' versus 'In Progress'. So if it's a new request that I send in, it should be 'In Progress', or it should be 'Solved.' I don't know why there's a 'New' status."

### Finding 5: There's an expectation that inquiries marked as solved by VA will not actually feel solved for Veterans.

_Labels: `AUD: Veterans`, `PRDT: AVA`_

People understand that 'Solved' means there's a reply from VA.

But, Veterans have low expectations something marked as 'Solved' will actually feel solved to them. Even before they read the reply, they anticipate frustration.

Fittingly, VA's reply was often misunderstood, 'too long' or 'obviously copy and pasted.'

If responses are not specific and personal, people prefer to use instant, automated tools. This includes business submitters, who turn to Ask VA for more complex questions, expecting more specific answers.

> "I'm assuming the 'Solved' [means] your issue was resolved, or whatever question you had was answered."

> "[It's typical] VA, like, no, you don't qualify for that, and that's the end of it. They say it's solved and, well, I still have my issue. What else? What other things are available? What other resources are available to me?"

> "It's telling you what alphabet suit group is responding. That this is for family members of service members. Veterans kind of blah blah blah. Okay. So in other words, no, you don't get nothing."

> "The status that says 'Solved.' Does that mean that they've provided me an answer to the question I asked or that whatever I'm mailing to them has been solved?"

### Finding 6: It's more intuitive to read and save a conversation that's in chronological order.

_Labels: `AUD: Veterans`, `PRDT: AVA`_

The order of the question details page surprised and frustrated people, who expect to read the VA's reply before they choose whether to reply back.

It's easier for people to read a conversation in chronological order, similar to an email chain.

Also, business submitters need to print the conversation for their files. They currently use workarounds, like creating a Word document, to save the conversation in an easy to read format.

Many people aren't sure how to print without a print button.

> "You could have either the email format where [I'd] see the answer 1st or  [my] entire question with the details [...] could be [over] to the side [so] I can see them both at the same [time]."

> "Oh, I had to scroll down to the bottom. Hmm, wait, what? So there's a section where I could actually reply again to it [in] the middle before I get down to see what the VA sent."

> "I print out the response because we have to have documentation to show the reason why we're doing what we did or the reason why."

> "I'm assuming I could click it and let's see... I'd probably snip it if I couldn't [print] because I don't see it. I don't know that I see an easy... a way to print it. Does that... unless I hit expand all I don't know if that helps or not? So, I probably have to go in and snip it and make it snippet and put it into a Word document."

## Additional insights

- Most people immediately understand that this was where they can find their previous questions.
- It's easy for people to find the 'Ask a new question' call-to-action.
- How to sort using dropdown list is well understood.
- Check details link is well understood.
- How to send a reply is well understood.
- People can return to their dashboard after submitting a reply.
- When business tab is first, it's saves an extra click and helps hide personal questions.
- Knowing how long it takes to receive a reply helps people understand Ask VA.
- Veterans will look for Ask VA in the app or under Contact Us.
- Those familiar with VA.gov, expect  questions to show up in My VA.

## Recommendations

1. Make it easier to compare last date updated with date submitted.
2. Help people find items based on category (now) or keyword search (in the future).
3. Remove 'New' status and start with 'In progress' to lessen confusion.
4. Change 'Solved' status to 'Closed' or 'Replied' to clarify intent.
5. Recommend plain language overhaul of responses from VA.
6. Move 'Your question' to 'Your conversation' and 'Send a reply' to the last item on the page.
7. Add print button to question details page.
8. Reiterate that a question has been 'Reopened' on the reply confirmation page.
9. Add 7 day turnaround time to subtitle on unauthenticated and auth homepages.

## Underserved groups we haven’t talked to 

We have completed the [VA Recruitment Checker for marginalized Veteran groups](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit#gid=1221033726).

We only had 1 no show so we exceeded our target of 6 participants. We aimed to fill gaps in our previous studies. So, we specifically called out Asian or Hispanic demographics when we recruited, because we haven't been able to recruit participants from these demographics in our last two studies. Still, we did not recruit any Asian participants. Also, this study did not recruit for other than honorable, immigrant origin, expat or AT users.
