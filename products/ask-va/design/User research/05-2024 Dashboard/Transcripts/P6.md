### Warm up

Tyler: Alright. So just to confirm. Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio today?

> P6: Yes, I'm fine.

Tyler: Awesome do you have any questions for me? At this point.

> P6: No.

Tyler: Okay. Is it helpful for you if we I like plan some breaks or do you wanna just let me know when you need a break.

> P6: The only time I need a break is if it gets urgent and there's no controlling when it's gonna hit.

Tyler: Okay, we'll play it by ear.

> P6: Sounds good.

Tyler: So we'll start off with just a couple of questions before we get your feedback on the prototype.

Tyler: I I'd love to learn how long you've been a veteran.

> P6: I served from 82 to 90,

> P6: but I didn't actually start using the VA at all until 2019.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: Sorry. There's some sirens on my end which might be loud for you.

> P6: Can't hear anything.

Tyler: Okay, perfect.

Tyler: They're just passing by. So I'll let them pass.

Tyler: Okay, I didn't want to yell at you. So you said it. 2019 is when you started interacting with the Va how do you? How'd you get in touch with the Va back in 2,019.

> P6: I had to show up in person. Get copies on my records prove that I was a veteran. I'll let stuff go through the process.

Tyler: And nowadays, when you contact the Va how is that usually happening.

> P6: I'm, mostly so it's a mix.

> P6: It's either. I'm already at an appointment and going, you know, stopping with a main va and then stopping in somewhere to.

> P6: you know. Get something's the ball rolling on something, or it's seeing my primary care, doctor, and asking to get referrals to something or get something. There started.

> P6: Sometimes there are messages, but messages are pretty much one of these, you know. They there's no real.

> P6: you know. It's only nothing ever really happens when you use messenger with some of these people.

Tyler: Yeah, tell me more about that. Is that messaging like your doctors, or.

> P6: I have every I found the responses and mess the messaging system to be to be.

> P6: So passed the buck, and unresponsive to what the question was.

Tyler: Hmm.

> P6: that it's like, oh, not my job. Not worried about it. Find somebody else.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. And is that usually getting in touch with like your healthcare team? Or is that like the Va more generally.

> P6: It's 50, 50.

> P6: I mean, I had an appointment with my primary care, doctor. Last Tuesday

> P6: we discussed my medications and stuff.

> P6: She said you were a normal and go about the business. And then I'm online yesterday, and there's nothing new renewed.

> P6: And I have to message her to ask her to renew. So it feels like I'm begging for each thing to. Could you renew this? Could you renew that.

Tyler: yeah.

Tyler: that's a frustrating experience.

> P6: I mean, yeah.

> P6: I mean, I don't

> P6: dealt civilian sector, you know, normal mill normal medica versus the Va. And they both can be extremely frustrating on all the different levels. So.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: yeah, for sure. I think I think that experience, and like some of that frustration, will be helpful for you to share more throughout our conversation, because it's pretty related to to what we're working on.

Tyler: Have you ever heard of Ask VA?

> P6: Yes.

Tyler: Yeah, have you? And you've used it before you said.

> P6: As just asking general generalized questions and stuff.

> P6: and got nowhere with anything.

Tyler: Yeah, okay, so was that a similar experience of like people trying to pass the buck.

> P6: It's what it felt like, yeah.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: yeah, that's frustrating. So I'm just gonna quickly share my screen. And I want us to just have a look at Ask VA. I know you've used it before, but just to kind of like a refresh in case it's been a little bit this is Ask VA, currently. So it's a it's a tool veterans can use, or other people can use to ask a question to the Va and you can ask questions about all different topics, so it could be about your healthcare or housing assistance, or whatever it may be.

Tyler: you know, you've used this before. It's basically like a contact form which I think we're all pretty familiar with and we're gonna talk about ask Va today.

Tyler: in our conversation. We're gonna pretend like you? Well, it's not really pretending, because you have submitted questions, but they won't be your actual questions that we're looking at. But we're gonna pretend like you've submitted a couple of questions in the past to the Va.

Tyler: Do you have any questions about either ask Va or the scenario today?

> P6: No, no, I understand.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: So I'll stop sharing my screen. And then we're gonna shift gears. And I'm gonna actually send something to you and have you share your screen?

Tyler: So I'm gonna just send a link in the zoom, chat

Tyler: and you should receive the link now and then. Take your time opening that up and let me know once it's loaded for you.

> P6: He?

> P6: It's loaded.

Tyler: Okay, awesome. And then we're gonna have you share your screen on zoom. Have you done that recently?

> P6: I've never done it before.

Tyler: Okay, awesome. Well, let's go ahead and come back to the zoom window, where you can see my face.

> P6: Right.

Tyler: And then once you're there towards the bottom of the zoom window, there's gonna be a bunch of little icons.

> P6: There it is! Green Share.

Tyler: Perfect. Yeah. So you'll click on that one. You're gonna have to choose the right window.

> P6: Okay.

Tyler: And then I'll let you know when I'm when I'm seeing something my side

Tyler: perfect, so it looks like it's loading awesome, so I can see it says, Ask Va,

Tyler: So we're looking at the same thing now. Okay.

> P6: And okay.

Tyler: So we can see we're on. Ask Va up in the top right corner. It says, Jordan. We're gonna pretend like that. Says your name and you're signed into your account. Okay.

> P6: And gang.

Tyler: And then feel free. We're not gonna click on anything yet, but feel free to scroll around as you like, and I'd love for you to just start describing this page to me, and what you're noticing.

> P6: Okay, the listing of previous questions. That's kind of helpful.

> P6: Instead of digging around to find out if somebody responded or something went through.

> P6: You can sort them with filters that's cool.

> P6: And ask any questions at the top. Yeah, I've seen.

> P6: Okay. So we're so good.

Tyler: Okay? So right off the bat like it felt pretty clear. These are questions you've asked in the past.

Tyler: You said it would be helpful, because they're all kind of in one place rather than trying to like. Dig around and find them.

Tyler: And then you figured out how you would ask a new question,

Tyler: awesome. And then also you mentioned those filters?

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: so let's look more closely at these questions that are already in here.

Tyler: What do some of these dates mean?

> P6: May 26th May 25th October 20.

> P6: well, it's sort of newest, oldest, so.

96
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.330
> P6: It looks like the he's on. Jordan's only asked 3 different questions.

97
00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:02.200
> P6: It

98
00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:07.799
> P6: does give the information when it was updated, though. That's that's a it's a

99
00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:12.619
> P6: lace, tells you. When you had the feedback.

100
00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:25.809
Tyler: Yeah, okay. So we see, like this date. So 1st of all, you notice, it's newest to oldest. And then we also see this date, and it tells you when it's last updated.

101
00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:33.050
Tyler: let's look at this card that says, May 21, st 2024.

102
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:38.919
Tyler: So we've got this date up at the top. May 21, st and then we have this last updated date.

103
00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:41.650
Tyler: What's the difference between those.

104
00:09:43.312 --> 00:09:50.130
> P6: Just the time at which it was last updated. So to me, that kind of tells me that that's when I got a reply possibly, or

105
00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:52.000
> P6: that it was read.

106
00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.740
> P6: And kind of like a receipt.

107
00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.900
Tyler: Okay. So that was like.

108
00:09:58.860 --> 00:09:59.550
Tyler: you don't have.

109
00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:03.519
> P6: Let's say, when it was actually created. Time. Wise

110
00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:05.780
> P6: It may have been

111
00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:13.390
> P6: 11 h and 59 min, it may have been, you know, and it's 5 days, 4 days and 11 h, you know.

112
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:15.150
> P6: Sound.

113
00:10:16.532 --> 00:10:23.940
> P6: Then that may be overkill for time. But the replies, I think, is more important is, when the creation was, we didn't wanna.

114
00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:25.500
Tyler: Okay.

115
00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:39.790
Tyler: so that that may 21st is, it sounds like, you're you're feeling like that's the date that this was created or submitted. And then the last update. It's kind of you want more detail for that last update. That's maybe more important.

116
00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:43.220
> P6: I think that that's sufficient.

117
00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:43.810
Tyler: Me!

118
00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:45.320
> P6: Don't have to. Yeah.

119
00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:52.590
> P6: you're not gonna get down into the minor details and give a synopsis of whatever the reply was.

120
00:10:53.047 --> 00:11:04.860
> P6: Otherwise you'd be displaying the entire thing here. But just knowing that when it was submitted, you know May 21, st and then when it was last updated, which one recommends when

121
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:11.950
> P6: when they replied, and then it's checked is solved. So that kind of tells me that

122
00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:13.805
> P6: you know we get

123
00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:19.450
> P6: You know, we get the relevant information as to whatever the Va. Has.

124
00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:20.720
> P6: That time.

125
00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:26.790
Tyler: Right? Yeah, that makes sense. And you said something interesting at the beginning of that which was

126
00:11:27.237 --> 00:11:36.340
Tyler: if they, if they displayed the Va's response. Here they would just be a lot of information. You can't put everything upfront. So how would you.

127
00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:39.526
> P6: There's no just you know. Yes, no answer. It's.

128
00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:40.360
Tyler: Me!

129
00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.950
> P6: Pages of, you know.

130
00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:45.699
> P6: legal speak. And you know, technically. And

131
00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:46.940
> P6: yeah.

132
00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:47.870
Tyler: Yeah.

133
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:51.180
> P6: I wouldn't. The the, the, the, the.

134
00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:55.279
> P6: the actual status there is solved kind of

135
00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:57.040
> P6: explains it.

136
00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:03.070
> P6: you know. The question is, I I'm 70 disabled. Do my dependence get healthcare as well?

137
00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:05.870
> P6: And so

138
00:12:07.599 --> 00:12:08.300
> P6: that

139
00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:13.620
> P6: there's an answer. But I am pretty sure it's not just yes or no.

140
00:12:14.279 --> 00:12:21.799
> P6: So going into well under these searches, and, you understand, is on a Tuesday during the full moon. Blah! Blah! Blah! We don't need all that.

141
00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:22.700
Tyler: Right.

142
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:25.180
Tyler: yeah, so.

143
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:26.650
> P6: Go ahead. Sorry.

144
00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:30.161
Tyler: No, no, you should take precedence over me.

145
00:12:31.236 --> 00:12:35.684
Tyler: That's that makes sense. So like you're expecting.

146
00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.770
Tyler: unfortunately, a lot a lengthy response.

147
00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:53.459
Tyler: And it's not going to be a straightforward like yes or no that we could even like Summarize here. It also sounds like you're noticing like the status says it's solved. And so that might mean there's a reply. Is that how you're thinking about it?

148
00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:54.800
> P6: Yeah, I'm

149
00:12:55.490 --> 00:13:01.510
> P6: looking at. As there was a reply with a definitive answer. You know whether it's, you know.

150
00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:05.200
> P6: one paragraph or 47 pages. It's.

151
00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:05.650
Tyler: Hmm.

152
00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:07.900
> P6: And it's a Va response.

153
00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:09.610
Tyler: yeah.

154
00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:10.250
> P6: So

155
00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.700
> P6: you know there is an answer to it.

156
00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:22.659
Tyler: yeah, that makes sense. And do you think solved is a good way of describing that like, you've gotten this answer from the va.

157
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:24.702
> P6: Yeah, the

158
00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:28.420
> P6: sad

159
00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:35.089
> P6: I would go with resolved instead of solved. Because solve sounds like it's it's all taken care of and fixed.

160
00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:43.430
> P6: Resolved means that you've got to me and as a writer. You kind of think of it as a

161
00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:45.829
> P6: as we resolve this question.

162
00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:47.100
Tyler: Hmm, okay.

163
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:52.880
> P6: Solved it, because the question still there and then then need to do something about it. Still, there.

164
00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:58.050
Tyler: Yeah, I think that distinction is really interesting. I can see how like.

165
00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:06.679
Tyler: Let's say, the Va. Said, no, you can't get healthcare through this, but you could go over here. Blah blah blah like it doesn't feel solved for that person.

166
00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:07.240
> P6: Yeah.

167
00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:08.160
Tyler: Yeah.

168
00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.829
Tyler: that makes sense.

169
00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:14.090
Tyler: there's another status here. It says, new.

170
00:14:15.029 --> 00:14:17.679
Tyler: Describe that one to me. What does that mean?

171
00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:28.430
> P6: the question is, how do I access secure messaging on the Va. Website? I'd like to send secure messages to my primary physician. Thanks.

172
00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:30.020
> P6: So

173
00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:37.854
> P6: I've kind of experienced this. I've had a primary care, doctor, that I could not send messages to.

174
00:14:39.927 --> 00:14:43.739
> P6: So to me, you know, this is this is, you know, we've

175
00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:51.469
> P6: th. This is the newest update of information we have for you. You know your doctor is such and such do such and such.

176
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:52.370
> P6: But.

177
00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:58.109
> P6: as I was told, you have to contact this individual at this phone number at the Va. Which

178
00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:00.119
> P6: phones never get answered.

179
00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:01.280
> P6: and

180
00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:10.040
> P6: you know, have them. Add your primary care, doctor, to your list of secure messaging, because you can't just randomly message. Anybody in the Va.

181
00:15:10.745 --> 00:15:11.450
Tyler: Right.

182
00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:16.839
> P6: The double secret squirrel and secret ovation. All that kind of garbage.

183
00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:19.460
> P6: Everybody's protection.

184
00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:20.370
Tyler: Yeah.

185
00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:23.299
Tyler: okay, so you're like relating to this question, because.

186
00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:24.588
> P6: Oh, God, yes. Yeah.

187
00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:27.319
Tyler: Because it's not exactly straightforward.

188
00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:28.045
Tyler: Yeah,

189
00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:34.760
Tyler: yeah, that makes sense. And then what does that like? What does the status new mean for this question?

190
00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:40.159
> P6: To me it just it. It was, you know, the basic like I just said you here.

191
00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:44.260
> P6: we can't add you. You have to contact such and such.

192
00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:53.670
> P6: So you can't say that it's solved. You can't say, or you have to call contact such and such at your local Va. To get your primary care, doctor, added.

193
00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:54.770
Tyler: Hmm.

194
00:15:55.064 --> 00:15:58.309
> P6: Where the other one is with the one that said solved.

195
00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:01.180
> P6: You know we have an answer. This is the answer, and.

196
00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:01.710
Tyler: Is.

197
00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:04.040
> P6: Definitive answer for whatever.

198
00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:07.609
> P6: So that's how I kind of make the distinction between the 2.

199
00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:10.409
Tyler: Yeah, okay, that that makes sense. So

200
00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:21.239
Tyler: for the one that's solved, they can give you the information. And from at least their perspective, they feel like it's solved. But for the other one, they they need to kind of like they can't really solve it for this person. Right? Okay.

201
00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:24.220
> P6: And we can't do anything about it except send you somewhere else.

202
00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:26.760
Tyler: Okay, got it? Yeah, that makes sense.

203
00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:37.010
Tyler: And what about like, we've got these little let's call them labels here that say, like healthcare sign in and technical issues. What are? What's that about.

204
00:16:38.165 --> 00:16:41.290
> P6: Just classifying is how you

205
00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:46.430
> P6: originally, you know, asked the question, what department or section you put it under.

206
00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:47.830
Tyler: Okay. Yeah.

207
00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:54.556
> P6: Yeah, even though you're looking at at the 1st one discussed to 70% disability, it's labeled under healthcare

208
00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:56.190
> P6: hits

209
00:16:56.250 --> 00:17:05.279
> P6: more like benefit section than healthcare, but the individual that probably started this was looking for healthcare for his family, for defendant.

210
00:17:05.589 --> 00:17:07.999
> P6: So that's why they tag this one.

211
00:17:08.645 --> 00:17:09.290
Tyler: Yeah.

212
00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:16.612
> P6: Sign in technical issues. That's 90% of just everything on the Va websites and phones.

213
00:17:17.339 --> 00:17:18.140
> P6: Him.

214
00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:24.110
Tyler: Yeah, okay, so it's kind of describing, like the the department that will

215
00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:27.100
Tyler: get this question. Let's say.

216
00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:28.919
> P6: Right in in in

217
00:17:29.509 --> 00:17:37.729
> P6: not having submitted it. I don't know it. Maybe it's generated by the user. Maybe it's generated from within the system as a reply.

218
00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:38.250
Tyler: This.

219
00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:41.423
> P6: Yeah, under this, you know, you should be looking at this under this section.

220
00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:43.450
> P6: in or this section.

221
00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:57.209
Tyler: Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. So I I totally see how it's like related to the question you've submitted. I'm curious like. So you're let's say you're Jordan. You're looking at your questions. Why is it helpful for you to see that

222
00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:59.570
Tyler: that category or that topic.

223
00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:08.410
> P6: It's

224
00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:11.600
> P6: it's kind of helpful in a way to know

225
00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:18.539
> P6: where I've asked the same question. Area before the same, you know. Is there something I've repeated before.

226
00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:34.760
> P6: I mean, we're most bets are not kids anymore. We do have Alzheimer's disease. We forget stuff. So having some sort of, you know, reminder or or something, and touch stone to look at and say, Okay, I did that before. Let's not do it again.

227
00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:35.720
Tyler: Hmm, okay.

228
00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:40.160
> P6: What did they say, or did I actually get an answer on this.

229
00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:40.990
Tyler: Right?

230
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:44.260
Tyler: So it's almost like

231
00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:53.239
Tyler: that makes me think, maybe you might say, Okay, let me look at the other healthcare questions I've asked like almost like a way of categorizing them.

232
00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.990
> P6: Right or sorting through making sure. What did I

233
00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:59.950
> P6: did? I forget it? Did I? Yeah. Yeah.

234
00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:05.236
> P6: And also.

235
00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:07.440
> P6: and also

236
00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:13.070
> P6: does kind of tell you where you're running into your issues, you know, for the users.

237
00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:18.850
> P6: you know. Is it just the health care issue question, is it? You know housing is the big thing.

238
00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:20.650
> P6: And technical

239
00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:26.510
> P6: and signing and technical covers everything, I think, from paper clips onto duct tape.

240
00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:37.239
> P6: So you did. That's such a broad one right there. But as a user, I I have to still think these are, you know, categories generated by the user, not by the

241
00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.870
> P6: responder for the system.

242
00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:42.150
Tyler: Yeah.

243
00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:55.849
Tyler: awesome. Yeah, that's that's making a lot of sense to me, and when we 1st like, started looking at this you pointed out the those like sorting menu. So it says, like last updated. And then status

244
00:19:56.183 --> 00:20:00.060
Tyler: why might those be helpful or or not? Something you would use.

245
00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:01.410
> P6: Well

246
00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:06.910
> P6: at a glance. You can see that. Oh! They answered this question with a definitive answer.

247
00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:10.360
> P6: you know, for that solved status.

248
00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:14.390
> P6: and that happened on such and such data, such and such time.

249
00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:26.750
> P6: you know. Maybe they miss looking back to see what the response was. You know they and then, and they know, okay. Somebody did answer it. It's just I never got back to seeing it, or I didn't get a notification telling me that they responded.

250
00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.560
> P6: It's a it.

251
00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:33.950
> P6: So far, everything there is is

252
00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:39.980
> P6: decent, pertinent information that did helps me tell how things

253
00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:46.419
> P6: went. I asked something. There was a response of some sort, or there was a definitive response.

254
00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:58.388
Tyler: yeah, that's good. It seems like it's been pretty easy for you to break down, like the different pieces of information in each of these boxes.

255
00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:05.749
Tyler: Why don't we go ahead and and click on that stat? It says status. And then it says, All that kind of menu

256
00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:09.548
Tyler: option. Yeah, let's just click that and open it.

257
00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:18.009
Tyler: awesome. And we can. Just I don't think you'll be able to choose one. But let's just look through these status options. So we talked about new already.

258
00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:19.070
> P6: Okay.

259
00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:24.540
Tyler: And then we talked about solved. It looks like we also have in progress and reopened.

260
00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:30.119
Tyler: So what are what do these statuses mean? Especially now that you can see all of them together.

261
00:21:31.816 --> 00:21:32.710
> P6: It did.

262
00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:33.710
> P6: kid.

263
00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:48.049
> P6: I mean, they're they're to me. They're they're pretty self explanatory, but it's nice to have the reopen one, because, if you may have got a response, but it's like you didn't directly answer my question.

264
00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:53.620
> P6: Which is another, you know, repetitive thing at the Va.

265
00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:54.510
Tyler: Yeah.

266
00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:58.830
> P6: Actually, it's repetitive everywhere. He didn't. He.

267
00:21:58.830 --> 00:21:59.290
Tyler: And join.

268
00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:06.740
> P6: Question but reopen is like, no, you know you told me this. I'm looking for this.

269
00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:07.425
Tyler: Hmm,

270
00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:11.300
Tyler: yeah, thank you so much.

271
00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:12.010
> P6: Side.

272
00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:19.640
Tyler: Is there kind of like some peace of mind? Because, you see that status? So you think oh, maybe that means I would be able to reply back. If they say it's solved.

273
00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:22.690
> P6: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it's you know, exactly.

274
00:22:22.973 --> 00:22:23.540
Tyler: Yeah, yeah.

275
00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:30.390
> P6: Have this one check to solve. They had the definitive thing about my, you know, 70 disability and dependence getting healthcare.

276
00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:34.580
> P6: But there was a question about my, my.

277
00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:47.450
> P6: my service, animal or something. Is it dependent? And all this other stuff is like, well, you know. Wait a second, you know. That's why you know, really wanted to ask you about. But I didn't mention it now. But I wanna ask about it now. So I'm tagging it onto this

278
00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:54.240
> P6: there will be relevant things and irrelevant things. I think you know users will do you do with that. So.

279
00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:57.199
Tyler: yeah, I can definitely see that

280
00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:01.070
Tyler: and

281
00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:04.430
Tyler: you can, you can click out of that when when you're ready, but

282
00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:13.540
Tyler: let's like, think about. So you you mentioned this earlier like this idea of like, maybe I've already asked this question and I forgot that I asked it. So I wanna I wanna check first.st

283
00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:21.099
Tyler: So let's say you're in that situation. You're like, I think, that I asked a question about home loans to the Va.

284
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:38.859
Tyler: And I know you only have a couple of questions right now. But you could. Let's say you had like 5 questions, and you wanna go and find out like, did I ask a question about home loans? And where's my, where's the Va's response? How would you find that like? Can you describe to me what you'd be doing or looking for.

285
00:23:39.483 --> 00:23:49.240
> P6: Well, the looking through the 3 headings for the topics here, then, the bottom one, you know, housing assistance and home loans

286
00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:52.910
> P6: I created on October 13, th 2023.

287
00:23:53.957 --> 00:24:00.889
> P6: I'd go to that pane and then click on check details to see what the response was.

288
00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:06.969
Tyler: Okay, yeah, that's helpful. So it sounds like, like we talked about earlier. You're looking for that.

289
00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:11.879
Tyler: That label that says housing assistance as a way of narrowing down the questions.

290
00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:12.510
> P6: Yeah.

291
00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:13.420
> P6: part of the.

292
00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:19.379
Tyler: I was like, what if you asked, like all your questions are about healthcare like? How would you then be able to figure out which questions.

293
00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:20.955
> P6: Oh, good Lord!

294
00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:30.859
> P6: number one never lump them all together. Number 2.

295
00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:34.739
> P6: If there was a sub menu.

296
00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:36.800
> P6: For for

297
00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:39.899
> P6: chronic issue, I mean.

298
00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:44.009
> P6: good Lord! That's almost like like doing medical billing and coding

299
00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:51.320
> P6: other than just having the generic, you know.

300
00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:56.700
> P6: user section of healthcare. I I think you're opening a

301
00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:02.430
> P6: lot more work for somebody.

302
00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:05.900
> P6: A lot more room for error on the user side.

303
00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.000
Tyler: Yeah.

304
00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:23.520
Tyler: that makes sense. So like it would be. It's a little easier here, because these are all 3 different, completely different topics. But if they were on the same, it would actually be really hard. And it's almost like I wouldn't really know how to look through all of them very quickly like you might need to read all of the cards.

305
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:24.400
> P6: Yeah.

306
00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:25.310
Tyler: Yeah.

307
00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:26.494
> P6: I mean in the

308
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:34.796
> P6: if you're asking about the question about pediatry, and then another one about renal failure, and another one about a heart condition.

309
00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:37.369
> P6: Well, it's all the healthcare. But

310
00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:44.339
> P6: if you don't make the subs, you know, then you know, the user still gonna have to sort through themselves.

311
00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:45.590
> P6: But

312
00:25:46.083 --> 00:25:57.979
> P6: hopefully, if they're savvy enough to to to get to the screen to begin with and ask these questions, they know what they asked, and they can just skim through. When did I ask that question? You know, for their own personal.

313
00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:01.689
> P6: Way to work with it easier and.

314
00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:02.680
Tyler: Yeah.

315
00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:07.390
Tyler: Yeah. And there you said something interesting we haven't really talked about. But like.

316
00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:13.959
Tyler: do you think that the date you ask the question would be something you might remember like realistically.

317
00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:20.669
> P6: Again. It. It varies. I, it varies per individual in in

318
00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:23.490
> P6: yeah.

319
00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:27.004
> P6: the pack capacity overall. I mean, we

320
00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:41.559
> P6: veterans are tend to be older individuals. We can remember some of the most oddball things in a lifetime, just like everybody. It's like, what is, what is the section of what could you be doing with the section of your brain that remembers lyrics to songs?

321
00:26:43.788 --> 00:26:46.155
> P6: Your home, your childhood phone number

322
00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:52.579
> P6: things like that. These are useless things. If we could remember this, it'd be easy. But

323
00:26:53.360 --> 00:27:04.909
> P6: just getting the the generalized thing. Okay, I've got healthcare. If you could, you know, by the the updates and the statuses and stuff, the ability from the pulldown menus which we haven't checked.

324
00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:09.569
> P6: that there'd be a way to sort just the healthcare stuff, and I could look

325
00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:18.040
> P6: through that and see. Okay, I was asking about disability here. I was asking about renal failure here. There's asking about heart something there, because you could read your quick, you know.

326
00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:24.000
> P6: Question, but not the response. Until you click on a detail. Something.

327
00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:25.030
Tyler: Yeah.

328
00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:28.330
Tyler: that's really helpful. I think that makes a lot of sense like

329
00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:30.839
Tyler: it. It feels like it would

330
00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:39.490
Tyler: be a little tricky. But probably you would 1st go. Okay, let me find all the healthcare questions, and then let me start to read through what I wrote

331
00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:41.970
Tyler: and and kind of skim that. Yeah

332
00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:55.670
Tyler: awesome. That makes a lot of sense. So let's go ahead. And what we're gonna do is we're gonna say that you wanna check the reply for this question that you asked on May 21.st

333
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:56.570
> P6: Okay.

### Question details

334
00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:05.390
Tyler: So go ahead and click. Yeah, I can see where your mouse is perfect. And then now we're looking for the reply. So just do what you like, and let me know what you're seeing.

335
00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:08.405
> P6: Okay?

336
00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:13.059
> P6: this is a pet peeve of mine.

337
00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:14.940
Tyler: Okay, explain.

338
00:28:15.389 --> 00:28:17.910
> P6: The 1st thing it pops up is, send a reply. It.

339
00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:18.460
Tyler: To.

340
00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:22.772
> P6: Hey? I I don't see the information I'm looking at, which is counter to.

341
00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:24.869
> P6: We all grew up on Gmail.

342
00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:27.800
> P6: And then in

343
00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:34.620
> P6: yeah, there, it's kind of a mental standard, in a way. Now for a lot of us that did that.

344
00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:46.910
> P6: So this is like counter. i i i and I see this on the Va sites, which is just like you know. Oh, tell us what it's like, but I haven't gotten to the information yet, so I have to scroll.

345
00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:50.905
> P6: And then I can say, Hello, you know, you received okay?

346
00:28:51.280 --> 00:29:04.330
> P6: And you got the places to contact. Blah. Blah blah blah blah. Okay. Now I have the information I needed, but to me that should be the 1st thing that pops up. Any reply to me should always be at the bottom and heading so that that.

347
00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:05.040
Tyler: Yeah, Jerry.

348
00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:13.680
Tyler: yeah, that makes sense so immediately, like the structure of the page doesn't make sense. It would make more sense for you to see their reply, and then decide if you want to reply.

349
00:29:14.933 --> 00:29:15.529
Tyler: yeah.

350
00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:18.250
> P6: I mean, I understand some, some.

351
00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:25.439
> P6: you know, tech and corporations. I need to do it different cause they they want you in their realm, and doing it their way.

352
00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:27.219
> P6: But when?

353
00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:28.930
> P6: Yeah, it's just like

354
00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:31.770
> P6: keyboard in your phone numbers.

355
00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:39.470
> P6: Okay, the the touch pad on your phone is upside down compared to the number pad on your keyboard.

356
00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:44.250
> P6: It is absolutely Bs. There should be just one standard.

357
00:29:46.149 --> 00:29:46.989
Tyler: Right?

358
00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:51.727
Tyler: So yeah, I mean that makes sense. And I can see how this

359
00:29:52.610 --> 00:30:00.060
Tyler: should shift so that that it's more intuitive, especially if it sounds like your task would be to find their reply.

360
00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:04.629
Tyler: And then let's look at like some of the details up here at the top like

361
00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:08.309
Tyler: we have your question, and then we've got some other information.

362
00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:13.722
> P6: Okay, you have the solve status that they gave the the textbook response.

363
00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:14.510
Tyler: Mmhm.

364
00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:16.239
> P6: Have a reference number

365
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:17.640
> P6: which.

366
00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:20.732
> P6: as a user, serves no purpose whatsoever.

367
00:30:23.345 --> 00:30:36.194
> P6: But if somebody ask you what was the reference number that the from the response sent. And yes, it's but since this is a closed system, anyway, there should be, you know, they should have the availability of that on their side.

368
00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:37.120
Tyler: Hmm.

369
00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:39.929
> P6: Gives the time.

370
00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:42.710
> P6: I mean the date that they did was sent.

371
00:30:44.529 --> 00:30:50.399
> P6: It isn't until you get down to the bottom that you see the time of the response so so.

372
00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:53.429
> P6: But initially.

373
00:30:54.071 --> 00:30:57.830
> P6: Just your information when we're you know your question in that.

374
00:30:58.030 --> 00:30:58.720
Tyler: Yeah.

375
00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:12.319
Tyler: so does it feel like it would make sense if it was like this information at the top. And then it was your. The conversation with the Va. Or how? What what order of the page makes the most sense.

376
00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:19.360
> P6: to me the the

377
00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:23.410
> P6: again. You're going back to the Gmail kind of thing.

378
00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:27.683
> P6: and you get your basic sent and detail information. That's fine.

379
00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:35.289
> P6: But the response should be at the top and and age that way. So you're seeing, you know. Okay, I sent them this.

380
00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:39.210
> P6: Now you gotta scroll down and read the the response.

381
00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:41.660
> P6: where your your question

382
00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:50.597
> P6: you clicked on a the card before to get the details for this, and you could read that it was. I'm on 70% visibility. Blah blah blah.

383
00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:57.040
> P6: But now you presented that again, just reaffirming what you knew when you clicked on it.

384
00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:20.529
> P6: if it wasn't again, it's if it was moved down. And the newest response was at the top, instead of having to scroll down. Because if you do, 2 and 3 back and forth like this, it's like, okay, down page, down, page, down page, down on page. Okay, there's the response they still question, now you're really pissed.

385
00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:22.260
Tyler: Hmm, yeah.

386
00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:29.589
Tyler: right? Okay, so it's you're really thinking that, like, yeah, like, the email structure makes more sense where it's like.

387
00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:41.549
Tyler: their reply is the most recent thing that happened. So that comes first, st and then your question, which is what happened before that? And then the option to send a reply is kind of like the last thing on your mind.

388
00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:43.430
> P6: Yeah.

389
00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:49.993
Tyler: Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense. And then we all you also mentioned the reference number like not particularly useful

390
00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:51.480
Tyler: and

391
00:32:51.620 --> 00:33:02.719
Tyler: and the fact that you have to like scroll all the way down to the bottom to see when that last update was is also another frustration. So I think all of that feedback makes a lot of sense.

392
00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:05.510
> P6: Yeah, the I mean you. You

393
00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:09.100
> P6: you got the synopsis on the previous page.

394
00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:14.660
> P6: But now you still you're getting just rehashed over again, I mean, for

395
00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:22.909
> P6: for somebody with with mental issues, or or learning or concentration, this would be helpful in a way, but.

396
00:33:24.368 --> 00:33:27.300
> P6: For the rest of us. No.

397
00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:28.390
Tyler: Hmm.

398
00:33:28.390 --> 00:33:34.360
> P6: That scrolling just makes it like, Okay, I have to do more d, and wasting more. My time.

399
00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:41.625
Tyler: And you're saying like, if for someone who had like to think a little bit more, they had mental issues as the way you said it

400
00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:47.919
Tyler: It could be helpful for them, like what might be helpful for them in this case, like just the reiterating.

401
00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:57.588
> P6: Well, there's a lot of people. There's you know, that there's a lot of, you know, people that are technophobes still. And they're afraid of email. They're afraid of to. Oh, it's a website. Oh, what

402
00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:04.890
> P6: you know. They they did just get overwhelmed by it, you know, and regardless of how

403
00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:08.020
> P6: simple anybody tries to design it.

404
00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:09.150
> P6: some

405
00:34:09.449 --> 00:34:17.486
> P6: having clicked the correct one that you know in the correct place you're looking for. Oh, I did look down, looking for the details. Okay, this tells them that. Yes, this is it.

406
00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:19.239
> P6: But instead of

407
00:34:19.929 --> 00:34:23.139
> P6: is it probably more of a pain in the butt?

408
00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:27.959
> P6: You could have the, you know, in in the either the email format

409
00:34:28.409 --> 00:34:32.440
> P6: where they'd see the answer 1st or having their

410
00:34:32.969 --> 00:34:46.650
> P6: entire. You know the question with the details, healthcare, the date, the solved, and the reference number could be in a pain to the side giving you, you know, they okay, that's still the same thing. And this is the response. I can see them both on the same, you know.

411
00:34:46.659 --> 00:34:47.059
Tyler: Listening.

412
00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:47.860
> P6: Engine here.

413
00:34:48.694 --> 00:34:53.039
> P6: But that may be too advanced for what the Va. Will allow.

414
00:34:56.040 --> 00:35:09.340
Tyler: But that makes sense like you're hitting this point of like, I want to be able to read like, or some people might want to be able to read their question and kind of the information about their question alongside what the Va has has explained back. Yeah.

415
00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:16.090
> P6: I mean the dual in in in the dual thing. Would you know? Here's the question, and everything else is a response or reply.

416
00:35:16.508 --> 00:35:31.639
> P6: and you could still do the the the, you know, reverse chronology, for you know newest response at the top. But the original question could be at the side is like, I was asking this question, and this is what they, you know. Responses has been blah blah blah.

417
00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:32.629
Tyler: Hmm! And

418
00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:34.120
Tyler: but.

419
00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:39.824
> P6: And more working on somebody else's part, and it could be resolved, just with this one simple.

420
00:35:40.770 --> 00:35:52.610
Tyler: Yeah. But I think, W. Well, regardless of, I guess, which way cause there are a couple of different ways to solve the problem you're noting it does sound like there's a clear problem which is like

421
00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:58.629
Tyler: most important thing, is the Va's response. I need to be able to see my question, and I need that to be like

422
00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:00.210
Tyler: close to one another.

423
00:36:00.596 --> 00:36:12.919
Tyler: So I think that that is really helpful. We haven't really had a chance to actually read the Va's reply. So I know you didn't ask this question. But just to reiterate the question was like, I'm 70

424
00:36:13.233 --> 00:36:19.989
Tyler: I have a 70 disability rating. Can my dependents get healthcare? So I'm going to give you a minute to read their reply.

425
00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:22.470
> P6: Okay.

426
00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:53.160
> P6: Okay.

427
00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:55.370
Tyler: Okay. So

428
00:36:55.570 --> 00:36:58.070
Tyler: tell me what you're thinking after reading that.

429
00:37:01.703 --> 00:37:06.770
> P6: It's telling you what alphabet suit group is responding.

430
00:37:07.876 --> 00:37:17.660
> P6: that this is for family members of service members. Veterans kind of blah blah blah 100. Okay? So in other words, no, you don't get nothing.

431
00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:18.380
Tyler: Right.

432
00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:25.199
> P6: whoever this is does not provide care coverage for veterans. Okay.

433
00:37:27.005 --> 00:37:31.730
> P6: reach out to patient advocate or local. Okay, yeah.

434
00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:34.660
> P6: Oh, here's a form.

435
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.530
> P6: but there's no link.

436
00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:46.689
> P6: And submit to the address. Fax d. And then, okay.

437
00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:53.870
Tyler: So as a writer and a veteran.

438
00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:57.129
Tyler: What are your what are your thoughts

439
00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:58.820
Tyler: with this reply?

440
00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:03.900
Tyler: Was it helpful? Is it

441
00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:05.589
Tyler: mid, you know.

442
00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:10.292
> P6: It's it's annoying, aggravating, and just kind of pisses me off.

443
00:38:11.564 --> 00:38:12.410
Tyler: Yeah.

444
00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:14.290
> P6: I mean, he

445
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:21.019
> P6: let me double check. So I just wanna make absolutely sure

446
00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:25.569
> P6: parents get healthcare as well. Okay? So the answer is no.

447
00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:27.280
> P6: But

448
00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:28.600
> P6: yeah.

449
00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:39.079
> P6: there's no personality to it, no personability. It's basically, you know, if you don't meet these criteria at 100%, then

450
00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:43.529
> P6: you know, and you're the only one that gets anything. Nobody. It's always sounds like.

451
00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:44.710
Tyler: Yeah.

452
00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:51.470
> P6: it's it's did 0 compassion or empathy. It's cut and dried

453
00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:53.720
> P6: love that with the VA.

454
00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:56.150
Tyler: Yeah, it's.

455
00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:59.039
> P6: Please reach out to your patient advocate at your local.

456
00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:01.940
> P6: Yeah, that's kind of.

457
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:04.840
> P6: And the

458
00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:18.550
> P6: Va, yeah, okay, we're gonna give you a link. That's not a link, you know. Maybe we give you an address. It's not a hot link that you, a form that we could just give you the the link to the form itself

459
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:20.050
> P6: instead.

460
00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:27.489
> P6: But if you have any other questions you want us to deny, just call 1, 807, 3, 3,

461
00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:28.350
Tyler: Yeah.

462
00:39:28.350 --> 00:39:28.950
> P6: Now

463
00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:37.540
> P6: a a. As as a writer. My mentor said I had a very good understanding of what they call the snarl words and per words.

464
00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:43.170
> P6: things that evoke emotions without trying, you know, not saying, to invoke them.

465
00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:44.200
Tyler: So moving.

466
00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:46.599
> P6: Upset with the word moist.

467
00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:50.696
> P6: That it evokes, that falls into those categories somewhere

468
00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:55.850
> P6: is totally all snarled. There is no purr to it.

469
00:39:56.370 --> 00:40:03.220
> P6: There's nothing. But at the same time you do have to have the.

470
00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:05.260
> P6: This is how it works.

471
00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:08.136
> P6: Not this?

472
00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:09.750
Tyler: Yeah.

473
00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:11.840
Tyler: okay. So

474
00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:20.300
Tyler: I think one of the main things is kind of the tone of voice. And and I guess how personal this feels like

475
00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:30.229
Tyler: you've went out and asked a personal question, and then you're expecting a more personal response. And then this is feels not personal. That's.

476
00:40:30.636 --> 00:40:33.890
> P6: This is bad cut and paste is best.

477
00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:37.019
Tyler: Right? Yeah. So it feels obviously

478
00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:38.850
Tyler: copied and pasted.

479
00:40:38.850 --> 00:40:44.524
> P6: Just to give you an example, my surgery, emergency surgery was on Saturday kidney.

480
00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:53.130
> P6: I said they were going to place a stint in place. I've had over 2 dozen plus stints over the years, because I have chronic kidney stones and kidney issues.

481
00:40:54.690 --> 00:41:02.240
> P6: I call on Monday to find out. You know, I'm looking at my district. We were, you know, called to get, you know, referred to student removal. Okay? So I call.

482
00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:04.810
> P6: They can't tell what kind of stent they had put in.

483
00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:05.830
Tyler: Hmm.

484
00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:11.099
> P6: Okay, give them leave. My number call me back. Nobody calls me back.

485
00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:12.200

486
00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:16.740

487
00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:20.030

488
00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:22.760

489
00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:24.460

490
00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:27.299
> P6: this is medical. This is like Eric.

491
00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:28.030
Tyler: Yes.

492
00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:31.189
> P6: These are not the mistakes you need to be doing.

493
00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:34.710
Tyler: That's yeah, that's bad.

494
00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:40.560
Tyler: But that's a good comparison point in terms of like copy and paste gone wrong.

495
00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:43.770
Tyler: And people know when things are copy and pasted.

496
00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:48.517
Tyler: yeah. And then the other thing you're kind of talked about.

497
00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:52.029
Tyler: you talked about this when we 1st started.

498
00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:53.440
Tyler: Was

499
00:41:53.970 --> 00:41:55.720
Tyler: this idea that, like.

500
00:41:56.040 --> 00:42:08.179
Tyler: you know, maybe their reply is, gonna be 75 pages long. And I'm gonna have to kinda like sort through and figure out what their response is. And I I know this isn't super long. But I did kind of get that feeling with you

501
00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:14.600
Tyler: checking like, okay, so I think that means they're saying, No, let me go check and read my question again. Is that what was happening a little bit.

502
00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:16.045
> P6: Yeah. Well, it.

503
00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:20.830
> P6: Yeah. Who whoever's you know? Fielding? The question.

504
00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:28.510
> P6: it's kind of irrelevant. You can fill it in at the bottom and did it again at the bottom with the the copy paste, or for further questions, you may call

505
00:42:29.544 --> 00:42:35.305
> P6: but our program is exclusively for members of service members, veterans who are determined, permanent.

506
00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:41.230
> P6: It's it's more of this, and it needs more of this, you know. Just get to the.

507
00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:41.940
Tyler: Mike.

508
00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:44.139
> P6: But at the same time

509
00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:46.590
> P6: it's a long-winded no.

510
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:47.850
Tyler: Right.

511
00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:51.779
> P6: I don't need to hear.

512
00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:58.379
> P6: I have this personal theory that the Va. Is designed to tell you. No, that's all. It is.

513
00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:03.180
> P6: some.

514
00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:10.160
> P6: and if they by law I have to tell you why they have to tell you no.

515
00:43:11.050 --> 00:43:11.560
Tyler: Right.

516
00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:22.320
> P6: This may be part of that, you know. You have to tell them because of this, or because of that, because this may be necessary, you know. Double talk just to to hmm.

517
00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:23.779
> P6: for no good reason.

518
00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:27.250
Tyler: For sure.

519
00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:30.380
> P6: It's yeah. It's just annoying

520
00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:31.330
> P6: to me.

521
00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:32.190
Tyler: Yeah.

522
00:43:32.890 --> 00:43:49.679
Tyler: I can totally understand that. I feel like it was obvious kind of from the beginning of our phone, like, call when you were talking about like your experience of messaging with the Va. And how it's not usually a good one, that this is almost like full circle like this is a little bit

523
00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:52.210
Tyler: meaning that expectation.

524
00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:57.069
> P6: It is completely i i i've had messages from social workers

525
00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:59.690
> P6: that I couldn't message back and couldn't add

526
00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:03.849
> P6: to get them added to my thing because they didn't. They didn't clear it.

527
00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:05.969
> P6: even though they wanted to reply from me.

528
00:44:07.350 --> 00:44:08.150
> P6: So

529
00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:15.169
> P6: yeah, there's there's there's a level of frustration that just seems to be inherent in everything. Va.

530
00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:20.530
> P6: 1st paragraph just sums it all up. So you know.

531
00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:21.490
Tyler: Yeah.

532
00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:24.940
Tyler: for sure. So.

533
00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:37.499
> P6: Say, due to regulations. We are unable to offer family members, you know, for you know, 70%, you know. But please reach out to your patient advocate for your local vms. That would be more personal.

534
00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:41.039
Tyler: yeah. It's, kinda, like.

535
00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:42.240
> P6: Go ahead!

536
00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:43.360
Tyler: You! Go ahead!

537
00:44:45.428 --> 00:44:55.949
> P6: Leave a hot link there with the 14 page, you know. Oh, not only this gets that, and only this gets that you don't qualify, leave a 14 page link to that.

538
00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:56.400
Tyler: Yeah.

539
00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:58.259
> P6: To the, to the forms.

540
00:44:58.410 --> 00:44:59.320
> P6: him.

541
00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:03.959
Tyler: I think that's I think your summary

542
00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:09.420
Tyler: is really helpful. It's kind of like. What's important to me is that they can

543
00:45:10.330 --> 00:45:14.609
Tyler: give me a response that's clear to understand and kind of upfront.

544
00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:18.099
Tyler: Treat me like a person, and I know they're a person, too.

545
00:45:18.490 --> 00:45:25.229
Tyler: and then, like link to any other extra information I might need, or if there's like another, and that a next step I could take.

546
00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:27.190
> P6: Yeah, about it all.

547
00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:29.320
Tyler: Yeah, I think that makes sense.

548
00:45:30.445 --> 00:45:37.359
Tyler: I'm just noticing the time we've got about 8 min left in the hour. Do you need to take a break at all, or.

549
00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:42.099
> P6: No, I'm good. I have a feeling when I move out of this chairs when it's gonna hit.

550
00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:42.640
Tyler: Okay.

551
00:45:43.330 --> 00:45:56.019
Tyler: okay, okay, well, we. We've kind of answered all my questions in terms of looking at this screen. So if you want to. We can stop sharing your screen. It should. There should be some kind of like red

552
00:45:56.531 --> 00:45:58.939
Tyler: bar you seeing it perfect.

553
00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:01.619
Tyler: awesome. Alright. So

554
00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:13.230
Tyler: we've got a couple of minutes to just kind of reflect. We talked a lot about some of the things we would change. Our conversation was super useful, and I'm excited to kind of go back through all that feedback.

555
00:46:13.691 --> 00:46:15.680
Tyler: I do want to understand. Like.

556
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:16.940
Tyler: what

557
00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:19.049
Tyler: are you hopeful about

558
00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:22.700
Tyler: with a a tool like this, like what is an ideal

559
00:46:22.850 --> 00:46:24.570
Tyler: way that this could all work?

560
00:46:25.170 --> 00:46:28.139
Tyler: And were there things that you did like about anything? You looked at.

561
00:46:31.870 --> 00:46:33.330
> P6: the

562
00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:38.880
> P6: 1st 3 pains showing

563
00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:44.698
> P6: on the 1st page. Great. Give you the synopsis. You can click for details. That's great.

564
00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:47.680
> P6: And inverting the

565
00:46:47.830 --> 00:46:57.039
> P6: you know the response, I think, or making it some other way to where you know what you asked, and get the response right then and there. The rest of it's Va, speak.

566
00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:58.390
> P6: Yeah.

567
00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:06.559
> P6: You know, there's only so much that they are going to change or allowed to change, and everybody's got to put their spin on something and make it.

568
00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:11.430
> P6: Yeah, yeah, there's there's only so much you can change.

569
00:47:11.830 --> 00:47:12.610
Tyler: Yeah.

570
00:47:13.290 --> 00:47:22.799
Tyler: that makes sense. Like, even if the tool works well, ultimately, the response from the Va, if that doesn't change, it's not as impactful.

571
00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:23.530
> P6: Right.

572
00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:24.620
Tyler: Yeah.

573
00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:26.059
Tyler: that makes sense.

574
00:47:28.870 --> 00:47:32.659
Tyler: what about like? So I know you've used Sba in the past.

575
00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:33.645
Tyler: and

576
00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:37.940
Tyler: and it might have like looked or worked a little bit differently.

577
00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:44.800
Tyler: for example, like, do you remember checking your replies from the Va. When you used ask Va.

578
00:47:46.170 --> 00:47:47.700
Tyler: I think that was happening.

579
00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:54.885
> P6: I think it was back when I 1st was using, you know, doing the Va started using the Va in 2019.

580
00:47:55.510 --> 00:48:03.730
> P6: And I think I ended up asking questions. Heck the Va. Itself getting responses before I went back to check online.

581
00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:07.017
> P6: There it seems to have been.

582
00:48:08.590 --> 00:48:16.699
> P6: Let's just say there's been a shift more from oh, the websites there! And you need to ask Bob down the basement at the main Va

583
00:48:16.770 --> 00:48:19.279
> P6: to. You can do this online. Now.

584
00:48:19.490 --> 00:48:19.944
Tyler: Hmm,

585
00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:23.029
> P6: You don't. You don't need to see somebody in person.

586
00:48:23.250 --> 00:48:30.779
> P6: but getting the user side to to line up with, you know. Oh, you can use it online. You don't have to go see somebody.

587
00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:31.640
Tyler: Hmm.

588
00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:40.600
> P6: And unfortunately for a lot of vets the time that they do see, the people at the Va. Is sometimes the only time they see somebody outside their 4 walls.

589
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:41.750
Tyler: Right.

590
00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:45.140
> P6: Some. It's their only interaction.

591
00:48:45.490 --> 00:48:46.250
Tyler: Yeah.

592
00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:48.647
Tyler: makes sense. There's like,

593
00:48:49.320 --> 00:49:02.292
Tyler: maybe, like efficiency gains, or for some folks who can't leave the house, it's good to have the online. But for a lot of people there's a there's still a need for that, like in person interaction for a number of reasons.

594
00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:05.060
Tyler: do you?

595
00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:07.549
Tyler: Is there a time that you have

596
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:11.309
Tyler: interacted with the Va. That you feel like has went well for you.

597
00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:22.049
> P6: On the the tech side or the the individual usage side, and.

598
00:49:22.050 --> 00:49:23.350
Tyler: Either either one.

599
00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:31.880
> P6: I've had an overwhelmingly negative time with the Va.

600
00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:32.640
Tyler: Yeah.

601
00:49:32.730 --> 00:49:35.169
> P6: I have chronic kidney stones.

602
00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:49.277
> P6: I have impending liver failure. They they still can't seem to get around to telling me what the State State, you know. Stages of my kidneys are because I haven't jumped through all the proper boxes yet.

603
00:49:55.450 --> 00:49:59.979
> P6: And it always feels like it's just. Oh, it's not my job to, you know. Pass the butt.

604
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:02.730
> P6: It's nice

605
00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:08.307
> P6: to to to work with groups like this, you and and developers

606
00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:13.560
> P6: to see that y'all are trying to do stuff, you know, to change what they're.

607
00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:18.689
> P6: you know, to make it more user, friendly, more intuitive, more.

608
00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:20.850
> P6: But the the

609
00:50:21.130 --> 00:50:25.010
> P6: the Va. Still has their own home.

610
00:50:26.070 --> 00:50:27.439
> P6: Why do they call it.

611
00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:34.470
> P6: There are medications that are on the civilian sector that they don't have in the Va.

612
00:50:35.890 --> 00:50:45.990
> P6: And some of them are just basic allergy medications. We're not talking, you know, tumor killing this, that and the other. That's 3 million dollars a year.

613
00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:48.559
> P6: We're just talking basic stuff, because

614
00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:51.529
> P6: well, the Va. Has to go for the lowest common denominator.

615
00:50:52.809 --> 00:50:59.470
> P6: There's a other than burning it all, and you know, raising it to the ground and salting the earth and starting over again.

616
00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:10.119
> P6: I don't see much of the Va changing. You can change the interfaces. You can do this stuff, and which is which would get the guy. You know, the individuals feeling better and hopefully

617
00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:17.980
> P6: if the people within start using it properly to, we can get, you know, things. More. Things can be done in a more efficient fashion.

618
00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:22.395
> P6: With some responsibility being taken by individuals.

619
00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:24.230
Tyler: Yeah.

620
00:51:24.370 --> 00:51:25.854
Tyler: totally. I think.

621
00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:32.049
Tyler: there's been a common thread in my conversations this week with other veterans that has been like.

622
00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:40.589
Tyler: it's nice if you make this easy for me to use. But it's not my main priority right now, like my main priority, is a bigger problem.

623
00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:42.380
> P6: Yeah. Well, the

624
00:51:42.730 --> 00:51:51.070
> P6: there's a i love. Ted Talks. Ever since they 1st started. I've loved Ted Talks, and one of my favorite one is the magic of not giving a fuck.

625
00:51:51.547 --> 00:51:53.839
Tyler: I need to look that one up.

626
00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:55.479
> P6: And she

627
00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:58.679
> P6: best selling author. She's, you know.

628
00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:01.990
> P6: one of the things she talks about is creating a fuck budget.

629
00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:05.910
> P6: which is, you only have so many fucks to give each day.

630
00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:13.460
> P6: Do you give a fuck about game of thrones? No? Well, then, you know, being invited to a party for game of thrones is not going to be your thing.

631
00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:21.269
> P6: So if you have 4 things you have to worry about, and one of them is your health. The other one's food, the other one's shelter

632
00:52:21.723 --> 00:52:27.086
> P6: the ease of getting, you know, whatever you know accomplish doesn't seem that great.

633
00:52:28.530 --> 00:52:29.310
Tyler: For sure.

634
00:52:29.310 --> 00:52:31.748
> P6: But you just have no limitations where you can work from.

635
00:52:32.110 --> 00:52:32.790
Tyler: Yeah.

636
00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:34.000
Tyler: for sure.

637
00:52:34.310 --> 00:52:36.324
Tyler: That makes a lot of sense.

Tyler: not only did you give us a lot of feedback on the tool itself, but a lot of other things to think about. So I appreciate that.

Tyler: Awesome. Yeah, we really do appreciate it. Do you have any questions for me before we sign off?

> P6: I'm good.

Tyler: Awesome. Well, you should. You should kind of know how it works from here like you're gonna get a thank you. Email and if you have any questions, you can talk to the folks at Perigan or Perigean. And I hope you have a lovely rest of your day. Good luck with the recovery.
