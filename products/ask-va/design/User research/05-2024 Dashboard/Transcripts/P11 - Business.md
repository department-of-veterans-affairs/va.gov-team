### Warm up

Tyler: Alright, so I just wanna confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio today?

> P11: Yes.

Tyler: Awesome. [P11], do you have any questions for me at this point?

> P11: Not at this point.

Tyler: Okay, cool. Well, let's start by like learning a little bit more about you and your role.

Tyler: Are you a school certifying official, a work study supervisor? Tell me a little bit about your your role.

> P11: So my name is [P11]. I work at [school]. I have been at this college for It's 8 years now.

> P11: But I have been a SCO for 10 plus years. My primary responsibility is school certifying official, but I'm also the program lead of veterans benefits. So that also means I am also a work study upervisor and I'm also the one who submits the work study timesheets.

> P11: I'm also the manager of all VA school certified officials at our university. We have one main branch and we have 6 extension campuses. And then with that we have 4 school certified officials.

> P11: Yes. Yeah, it's fun.

Tyler: Okay, wow, okay. Sounds like you have a lot to manage. Well, that's great experience because I'd love to learn a little bit more about like how you're using SBA as a school certifying official but also maybe sounds like you might be helping other people like learn how to use things like that if you have other school certifying officials you're working with.

Tyler: Tell me a little bit about how you use Ask VA either as a school certifying official or for work study, paperwork and things.

> P11: So for as a work study site official, we use Ask VA to submit the time sheets and the approval of applications.

> P11: When 1st started doing the work study supervisor, It was during COVID. So everything has changed now as far as submitting documentation, but. Using Ask VA for the work study, it became simple once you figured out the process of submitting the time sheets.

> P11: But it was a little complete at 1st trying to figure out the process. Submitting the time sheet.

> P11: As the school certified, for sure we use it sometimes to ask questions. Or as soon as that may came back like if we received our overpayment. Or if the sooner received a debt letter. I've also access to, use it for like mitigated circumstance.

> P11: I have a student who passed away. I'm trying to figure out how is that gonna process the alternative back to VA. So I used it for that purpose. I also have family members who have used it who have been on disability for disability claims. So they have used it in order to see if their claim has been processed or if they needed to submit additional documentation.

> P11: We do have some Veterans that come in. Asking about the same thing. About using how to, they're able to submit their D. 2 14. Or if they needed to submit additional documentation for their disability claim, we have used it for that purposes too as far as the school.

Tyler: Okay.

> P11: We have shown the student how to use it. We don't use it for the student. We have shown this unit how to use it for that particular purpose.

Tyler: Okay. That's like such a range. And in there, you said something about family members also potentially using it for, their own disability claims. Is that family members that are Veterans, I'm guessing? Okay.

> P11: Yes. I have a sister who is a 100% disabled Veteran. I have a cousins and then Of course, you have people who like, oh, she works with the VA. She can help you out. So I have, they're not family members, they're associates, but yeah, we have show them. I have shown them how to use that too.

Tyler: Okay. Okay, awesome. And then in those cases, do you tend to like just show folks how to use it themselves so they submit like an inquiry on their own behalf or will you sometimes submit on behalf of the family member for for example.

> P11: No, no, never send it on behalf. We will show. I will show them how to do it. So basically they'll sit down, they'll log into the system, I'll show them how to access it. And then show them when they act particularly well, what question should I ask or what topic should I do?

> P11: And they gear them towards the right topic. And then of course, they'll be like, I submitted it and I'm like, okay, you submitted it without the documentation. So we need to go back and do another one. With the. So. That's what I will do.

> P11: We wouldn't submit it on their behalf. Basically we are just showing them how to do it and making sure they submitted the correct documentation.

Tyler: Okay, gotcha. Well, I'm really excited to talk to you because it'll be really interesting to hear like your perspective in this business capacity, but you also have this perspective of helping folks to submit like personal inquiries.

Tyler: And I'd love to like hear about some of the hurdles you, notice that they face, when you're helping them out.

Tyler: Very cool. And so is that how you're usually getting in touch with the VA? Is it through Ask VA or is there another way that you might contact the VA?

> P11: No, for the VA, I usually call the SCO hotline. For the, for business purposes, I usually call. But usually with that is because you can get a quicker response. If it's a more complicated question. Then we make do the Ask VA if it's a more complicated question or if it goes in more details.

> P11: A particular situation, then we'll do Ask VA. But for me, my primary contact is to call the student hotline.

Tyler: So you're using that student hotline because you feel like you can get faster answers unless it's like a more complex question.

> P11: Okay. Yeah, if it's a simple question, then the hotline. But if they complicated question that requires more research or more depth. Well, we used to do with Ask VA.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense. And obviously there's. You know, you have these like SEO examples that are more like potentially like questions for the VA and then you have work study, which is more like, uploading documents and things like that. Is that is that a fair assessment?

> P11: Yes, usually for that then Ask VA or SCO questions. As a work study supervisor, I usually don't have any questions. If I have any concerns, as far as, yeah, I would do Ask VA if I have any concerns as far as how many hours a student may still have. Or if the students trying to do extended their time period, then yeah, I usually do Ask VA for those particular questions.

> P11: Yeah, I hardly ever call for work study.

Tyler: Okay. Okay, gotcha. And then when you're calling the SCO hotline, for like more so SCO questions, you said like it tends to be simpler questions. Can you give me an example of like what a simpler question might be?

> P11: So if we had a student who let's just say I just usually call the max and what's tuition fee sent to our school for a particular student. Or if we'll call and see if a soon, if the soon says I have a debt, so we'll call them and be like, do you know, particularly from what time period this debt is? And they'd be able to tell us the time period and the reason why the student had to debt. So just like simpler questions like that.

> P11: For the more complex questions like you mentioned a student passing away, that's probably a more complex situation or one that doesn't happen as often.

Tyler: Are there other kinds of like complex things that come to mind that you've dealt with?

> P11: So we had, we received a tuition for a student twice. We received payment twice and we didn't receive didn't know why we kept receiving this payment so that was a more complex that required them to do more research into it.

> P11: Also if a student, we had a issue when we were reporting graduation. And for some reason the student was coming back with a debt.

> P11: So anything that requires more research than the person is able to do over the phone. We do Ask VA.

Tyler: Okay. Yeah. Is there ever a scenario where you call on the phone and tell them like the question and then they say, can you actually submit this through Ask VA? Will they ever do that?

> P11: Yeah, so sometimes the process should be like, okay, I'll put a note in account, but you may want to contact XVA for them to do more for the research or they're not able to answer my particular question. It may not be about a certain student, it may be a scenario that came up like the student who passed away unexpectedly.

Tyler: Okay, gotcha. And when you're using Ask VA, I guess you can think about this through like your own work, but also maybe if you're helping a family member, is it always on your computer or would you ever use it on your phone or would they ever use it on their phones?

> P11: It's always on the computer. If they try to use it on the phone, sometimes I notice with family members, I know for, of course with SCOs, we're used to doing. But I know, family sometimes they can get a little confusing because they can't find the particular link. Or they're not able to see all the information in one screen. So yeah, Ask VA is not really friendly on the phone for, I would say, older or particularly Veterans who are trying to get a quick answer.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. So it's not very easy to use on the phone and hard to see all the information.

> P11: Right.

Tyler: Do you think if it was easy to use on the phone it would be something that like you would use in a business capacity or your family members might prefer or or maybe not.

> P11: Not in a business capacity. Because of security reasons of course I wouldn't use in the business capacity but for family members yeah especially for the ones coming out now that just needs to upload a documentation and they can They have a, they can take a picture of it with their phone and they can just upload it there.

> P11: So yeah. It would be used a lot for especially the younger generation coming out for family members, but as far as the business capacity, that we wouldn't be able to do it for security reasons.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. How many inquiries do you feel like you're submitting per month, and that might be like SCO and work study. Yeah, however you wanna think about it.

> P11: So work study because we usually have about 2 to 3 work studies every semester. So I would say for work setting about 10 to 12 depending on their hours for that week. As far as SCO maybe once or twice a month.

> P11: It just depends on the scenario. It just depends on the scenario. Sometimes it's just quicker to pick up the phone.

Tyler: Okay. Yeah. That makes sense.

Tyler: Awesome. Well, I still have a bunch more questions for you, but I think we're going to talk through them as we look at the prototype and get your feedback.

Tyler: So, I'm going to send you a link in the chat on zoom. And then if you can just open this up on your computer, So I just sent the link and let me know once that's loaded on your side.

> P11: Okay, it's loaded.

Tyler: Okay, awesome. And then, and you shared your screen on Zoom recently?

Tyler: Oh, perfect. Awesome. So now I can see what you're seeing. It looks like it says ask the A.

Tyler: We're gonna pretend like this is your account. So you've just signed in. And now you're into your Ask VA dashboard.

### Dashboard

Tyler: And so we're not gonna click on anything yet, but you're welcome to start scrolling around and I'd love for you to tell me what you're starting to notice.

> P11: Okay, so I can see now for the business that the way that it's a lot bigger. I think most of the time some SCOs because the majority of them are Veterans. A lot of times when they're doing this, they may get confused with the personal and the business because they have them themselves are Veterans. But if they know they're doing it particularly for their job, they used to go for the business part.

> P11: I know for family members though. I particularly my cousin. He was like, I don't see where I asked for a new question. I was like, if you look up at the top, it's the very 1st thing. They tend to see to skip this part. Oh, and they're always like, I don't know where to go for new one. I just see the one I submitted last time.

> P11: So yeah, he has it's the opportunity to skip the 1st part if they don't see it right away.

Tyler: Yeah, I can see that.

> P11: So I don't know if that can be bigger or bolder or something.

Tyler: Yeah, I can totally see that.

Tyler: So you mentioned how, these kind of, there's a business tab and there's a personal tab. And how that can be confusing for people who are in a business capacity but they're also veterans. Are all of your questions under the business, tab?

> P11: For me, yes, because I'm not a veteran. So I would, I still have the personal tab. It will still show up, but it wouldn't be. Nothing underneath that. They'll just be mainly business.

> P11: So that's 1 thing when I noticed when I was doing Ask VA when they was like, well, what type of question are you answering? I have to make sure it's always in the business section.

> P11: But yeah, but I just know that sometimes. Especially that some majority of the SCOs are veterans themselves. So they always be like for Ask VA, do you like, yeah, I may do personal, and then I don't need business. And I mean, I can get what they mean by that. But yeah.

Tyler: Yeah. Yeah, for sure. I can see how that's confusing. Having like both things in one place. And we've got these cards in here. I think you said like they're a little bit bigger.

Tyler: Let's look more specifically at one of these and I'd love for you to just go through the information in one of these cards and describe to me what it is.

> P11: All these have to do with work studies. Okay, so yeah, all the cars have to do with work studies. These are just the time cards.

> P11: So I mean, I can go through the time cards. So basic.

Tyler: You won't, yeah, you won't be able to click on everything, but that's okay.

> P11: Oh, sorry.

Tyler: That's okay. All good. Okay, so you notice these are all work studies. How did you how could you tell that was the case?

> P11: Just by the description of it, it's where the timecartes has timecards, application, signed contract. All that has to do with work study.

Tyler: Okay, does that look similar to how you would put in your time cards? Would you do something similar like with the student name?

> P11: Usually I wouldn't put in the full name and may put in the last name. We used to put in the last 4, but they disencouraged that.

> P11: But I usually didn't do the phone, the full name. I would usually like the person that's your last name.

Tyler: And would you, would you put any other description in that question area?

> P11: No, cause usually it says what it is. It's a signed contract. It's the application.

> P11: Yeah. So yeah, since it says specifically what it is, I wouldn't put anything else.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So we're seeing that these are work study. submissions and then let's look at this card on May 14th So what does May 14th refer to?

> P11: May 14th is usually the date we submit it.

Tyler: Okay, gotcha. So it's the date you submitted and then right above May 14th it says education benefits and work study and what's that?

> P11: [Education benefits and work study] is the topic you have to choose in order for you to make sure it goes to the right place.

> P11: So that's usually, that's usually the topic. That's the topic you use is education benefits work.

Tyler: Okay, got it. So when you're in Ask VA, you can choose like 1st you choose a category, right? That's like more general and then you go into and choose a topic. I see you nodding.

Tyler: So your category, is it usually always the same category?

> P11: Usually the category would be, okay, the category I believe is education or benefits. And then of course it actually, you know, how you referring to the student and then underneath it, it would be work study. So once you put work study. Then of course it will actually for your information.

> P11: For the business purposes, it will be education, I believe it's education benefits are underneath education and then underneath that it will be like. Education benefits, I believe that's the category.

Tyler: Okay, yeah, yeah. And if, if your SCO, so you're not like you have your SCO hat on, you're not doing a work study submission. Do you do you know which topic you would use in that case if it's not work study? Can you remember?

> P11: Is usually underneath where it says benefits and then it would be like education benefits. And then of course, it will act you a series of questions. Like the relationship to. I am an SCO or a relationship to the veteran who's submitting. Oh, actually, a whole bunch of questions like that. And then your your facility code and then you'll put in your information. Or you'll put in the question.

Tyler: Okay. Gotcha. Okay. And we're looking at like 4 questions, which, you know, considering how many work study. Time cards and things like that you're submitting you probably have quite a few questions in your dashboard.

Tyler: How would you be able to tell like which if you're looking for a specific question how would you be able to tell which one it was like How do you Find it.

> P11: It would probably be underneath the topic. I will probably have to research the name. So I'll probably filter it out by the name itself. So let's say I'm looking for a time card for a particular student to see how I've got submitted. Then yeah, what has to filter out the name itself and the date that I submitted it. That's it.

> P11: Everything is the easiest way to do it. Either filtering sometimes does not work. You just have to do a search. And just search by the date that she submitted it.

Tyler: Okay, so it's date you submitted. And then when you're saying the name, is that the student name?

> P11: Yeah, the student name that's in the topic. Yeah, cause sometimes when you look for the results for the Ask VA, it just gives you, it doesn't even show you the topic on the dashboard. It just shows you the claim number. So that's where the date comes in effect of the day that I actually submitted it to the VA.

Tyler: Okay, gotcha. Do you keep that somewhere? Like how do you know, the date and the name and stuff like that?

> P11: Usually. Particularly for work studies, I keep it in a folder, for especially for their time cards. I keep it in the folder for my own documentation. It can get a little confusing because sometimes wouldn't for the SCO part of it, we try to keep it in a folder, but sometimes we're just keeping in our email so then we have to search our email.

> P11: But specifically for work studies. Yeah, each work study has their own individual folder. So I keep their stuff in the folder.

Tyler: Okay, and when you're talking about a folder, are you printing stuff out and putting in a physical folder? Or you've got a folder on your computer.

> P11: I have a folder on my computer through my own Onedrive, but I do know some SCOs are printing out that information and keeping it in a particular formula.

Tyler: Okay. And let's talk a little bit more about that. So. When you kind of like from the beginning of the process, you're going to submit this inquiry. Maybe it's an SCO one, maybe it's a work study thing. What would you put in that digital folder? Like would you print? You know, would you like save something? How would, how does all that work?

> P11: I just take a folder, I would save, the work description. The application, the sign contract. And the time for it. And then also if they come back for the following semester, it will be a new folder for the fall semester with the same information.

Tyler: Okay, gotcha.

> P11: The main reason I was doing that is between compliance surveys. Sometimes they do ask for the work setting information for the compliance surveys. And then sometimes I haven't, our school hasn't experienced a risk based survey, but we do know from other schools that they may ask for that information. So we just keep it for documentation.

Tyler: Okay, gotcha. And, I might have missed this because my brains a little bit like full of information now, but you're obviously putting in like the time card and things like that that you would need to give the VA like the attachments but are you ever like needing to print out like the VA's response to you? For example, like what you submitted to the VA in AVA itself.

> P11: As far as work setting, no. Because usually it's as a yes or no. So it depends. Like if we submit a time sheet and then said the student is over the hours. Or the student did not meet the students at the end of the contract will print that out because that means that's the reason why they didn't get paid. So we keep that.

> P11: But as far as SEOs, yes. I do print out the response because we have to have documentation to show the reason why we're doing what we did or the reason why. This particular issue wasn't resolved so yes we do print that out and we do keep that.

> P11: I do know some SCOs are still keeping hard files. They'll put it in their hard files for the student. We have digital files, so we'll put it in the Onedrive file.

Tyler: Right. Okay, that feels clear. And do you ever need to keep track of the reference number that is associated with that inquiry?

> P11: It depends on the inquiry. So yes. For instance, like the student who passed away, we're still trying to give VA back the money. So we're still having, we keep that reference number. So when we call the, trying to get the debt letter for that, we're able to refer back to that reference number. So for that particular situation, yes, we'll, we'll keep the reference numbers.

> P11: But if it's solved. We'll just turn it out and put it in the folder if it's solved.

Tyler: Okay. And when you say – sorry for the really specific questions, but when you say like you'll keep the reference number somewhere for that specific case where you're trying to pay back the VA. Where are you keeping that reference number? Is it like a note? Is it like a sticky note on your computer? Is it in the digital folder?

> P11: Yeah. It's usually in the digital folder. So then that way we know for that particular student we can just click the folder. And be able to refer back to that, but that's just our business practices. I do know some other SCOs, they do keep it written down in a post it on their desk. So it just depends on the SCO in the situation.

> P11: But yeah, so that's usually how we do it. Is we do keep the reference number, we keep it in that digital folder. With the students so that's easy enough for us to click it when we're referring back to that situation.

Tyler: Right, okay. Yeah, it sounds like you have to be super organized. And is it, do you put the reference number like in a Word document and then save that into the folder or how do you keep it?

> P11: Usually when it comes back with the email, I just keep the email. Yeah, that's how I do it.

Tyler: Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay.

> P11: Yeah, I just keep the email. In the reference folder.

Tyler: So you just like download the email as a PDF or something? Okay.

> P11: Yeah, I just print that, yeah, print the email as a PDF and then put it in the folder. Yeah, that's the easiest way for me.

Tyler: Okay, gotcha.

> P11: And you know I'm the present of the [state association for school certifying officials], so as I said, I know some, especially for the NCDs. They do not do that. They are oldschool. They are pencil and paper. So I know that they were usually they wouldn't print it out. They usually put it on a post it or something or keep it in a phone or put it on a word. And print out that way you can keep it in our copy folder. So it just depends on the institution and how big or small they are. So. But I know particularly, yeah, for the NCDs in like the flight schools, they wouldn't do all the digital. So they are still on paper.

Tyler: Okay, gotcha. And can you fill me in on what NCD means?

> P11: Non-college degree.

Tyler: Okay, thank you. That, background is really helpful. We're like trying to better understand how you guys are tracking all of these things, especially how Ask VA comes into play.

Tyler: So looking back at the screen now, we got these 4 questions, and they all have some of them have different statuses. Can you share with me what you think those statuses mean?

> P11: So the 2 that says new, that means that the the time card has been submitted. The one this is in progress means that the VA has received it and they're processing it.

> P11: And then the one that says solved means that the VA has received the signed contract and the student is ready to go.

Tyler: Okay, so that one's kind of like finished.

> P11: Yeah, the solved is the finished one. The new ones means we just submitted it that day. And then in progress means the VA has received it, but it hasn't been completely submitted to them yet or completely.

> P11: Cause you know, I mean, complete it in the VA, portion yet.

Tyler: Right, right. That's still happening. Okay, that makes sense. And there's a date that it was last updated. Who would be updating?

> P11: That would be, so that's the date the last updated. Usually the once this is new, that last update today is probably us when we submitted it. But with the other one where it says like May 8th May, 12th, that means the VA has completed it. So they're the ones who last updated it.

Tyler: Okay, gotcha. So it could be either you or the VA depending on, yeah.

> P11: Right. It's just depending on whoever touched it last.

Tyler: That makes sense. Okay.

Tyler: Let's for a second think about this use case of your family members using Ask VA. So I know it's a little different because they wouldn't see this business tab. But you can click on that personal tab.

Tyler: We'll kind of just pretend like there's no business tab. You can just see the personal inquiry and this looks more like what someone might submit for themselves.

Tyler: Looking at this and kind of putting on putting yourself in your family member shoes. What's your reaction to this?

> P11: The question here, they would never see that question. You see how it says I'm trying to get it would usually just be the topic.

> P11: So they wouldn't usually see this question that goes. So. And the word says solved and then check details. I would probably have to instruct my family member to click the check details. To see how it was solved.

> P11: Because yeah no one but yeah, so I mean. Yeah, this question here they would they would never see that they would you see the topic and, so, solved.

> P11: We would have to instruct them to make sure they click check details to see how the question was solved.

Tyler: Yeah, I could see that.

> P11: And it's sometimes in the check details even there the questions really not solved the questions like oh it's been submitted again. Thank you for your response or something like that. So it really it wasn't solved. So yeah, it's just they need to be know that they need to click the check details to see what's going on.

Tyler: Right, I can I can see that.

> P11: With the question instead of thinking it was completely solved because usually it's not completely solved. It's something else they have to do.

Tyler: Yeah, for sure. And when you're saying like they for that question part there, they wouldn't see that they would see their topic instead.

> P11: Yeah, it would be the topic. So like, you know, when you when you do Ask VA, you have to put in the topic of the question. And then you write your question, of course, like any other email. That you sent out any other question. So it would just be the topic. Most questions went put all that, the SCO or something like that. I mean, they'll know what it is but it wouldn't be a question form like that. There so that would be in the body of the email. This topic.

Tyler: Okay, got it. So are you talking about like the subject? Is that what you mean by the topic?

> P11: Yes, yes, yes, yes.

Tyler: Okay. Got it. Okay. Do you think that?

Tyler: I guess like seeing this now where it's like the body of the question Is that more useful to see or is the subject more useful to see?

> P11: I think this subject because most of the time when people look for in their emails they're looking for their subject.

> P11: Because sometimes the body of the question may be confusing. So I think the subject would be more, easier for veterans to look at. Where is clear and concise.

Tyler: Yeah. I could see that. Okay, let's go back to the business tab.

Tyler: And then anything else you want to comment on this page?

> P11: No, I mean, I get the tiles. I think it's just a personal preference for me. I really, I just like stuff like a list. The tiles are cool but I like the list. But that's just a personal preference for me.

Tyler: Yeah, I could see that. And maybe it's like more what you're used to or whatever.

> P11: Yeah, and to be in date order. So like the May 17th, May 14th, May 18th, like in a list.

> P11: But again, that's just a personal preference for me.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. Would you expect this to be in date order by the day you submitted or the day it was last updated.

> P11: Yeah, submitted.

Tyler: Okay. Yeah. So let's look at one of these inquiries a little bit more closely. So this May8th one that solved, you mentioned that it's solved to that probably means the VA has like resolved this and it's finished. So they've they've probably replied to you. So let's click on check. Details.

### Check details

Tyler: And then let's go ahead and look at their reply.

> P11: Yeah, that's sounds about the reply they use. Yeah, uploaded. It worked and completed. Yeah. So as long as it has worked and completed. This is good to go. Usually if it gets denied, it will say a reason why it got denied.

> P11: Usually we can't reply to it. So having a reply button is good. As usually we we can't reply.

> P11: But yeah, so this looks like it's good to go if it's getting denied. So yeah, if it got denied for any reason, I'm gonna reply, but it would be good because they would be able to correct it. The only problem with that is because right now it says it has been closed. Please create a new inquiry for future.

> P11: So let's say it got denied so that it will be closed. So by the time it be closed, we can't reply back to this. We'll have to submit a whole new one. To see why the original one was denied.

Tyler: Right, okay. So a couple things here. One is you very quickly scroll down to the conversation to find their reply.

> P11: Yeah, and the only reason and I know how to do that because I've seen this before. Most of the time trying to find a reply right now. Yeah, that can be a little cumbersome because you have to click like 3 links to find what the reply was.

> P11: But I do like the layout where you can find it very quickly now instead of clicking the links.

> P11: So it's nice that it's like, it's open. You don't have to click a bunch of things.

> P11: Yeah, because right now you have to click the response number and then click the reply. It's just a lot clicking. So at least with this is right here. Open up where you'd be able to see it.

> P11: It may be easier to put the conversation above the center reply. That way it's right there. And then if you need to send a reply, you can. Yeah, especially because it says it's been closed. So like that needs to be above the reply body.

Tyler: Yeah. Right. Yeah, I can totally see that and then you also yeah you clued into like the text which you said looked pretty familiar kind of like what you're used to getting from them but you're noticing like it says the incident been closed so I probably can't reply so It's a little bit confusing when it says send a reply.

Tyler: Yeah. And so usually when you need to, if you need to follow up on something like the VA closes it and you're like, wait, no. Do you just submit a new inquiry?

> P11: Yeah, we have to submit a new inquiry. That's why I used to do the reference number. I was like, please refer back to this. Reference number for them to look at the old email.

> P11: But yeah, they'll close it completely. You'll have to submit a new inquiry. Asking for a response or asking for the reason why it was closed or if they can research it a little further. Because you have different information than they have.

Tyler: Okay, yeah. I think that makes sense. It sounds a little bit complicated.

> P11: Yeah, so that's especially where that reference number we will like, please refer back to the reference number. We will say please refer back to the reference number of this ticket. Yeah.

Tyler: Yeah. Okay. Okay, well that, that's really helpful. I think you've kind of answered most of my questions for this in terms of like the dashboard.

Tyler: Anything else you want to share with me about this part of the process or not the submitting part but kind of what happens after that.

> P11: Yeah, this kind of response with all this information. It's a lot, but like if you're an immediate danger, I get they have to put that. Is our commitment so like this whole thing is a lot to read sometimes it'll be nice if it's bold underneath where the inquiry is and then they can put like Ask VA and then put their little spiel.

> P11: But yeah, this is the typical response.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. And we've gotten really similar feedback even from Veterans about it being like, okay, I know this is information you're supposed to tell me every time, but I want it to be more clear like where that starts and ends. 

Tyler: 1 more question on this page for me that I just thought about is you you were talking about how like for some work study things you'll have to like I'm gonna say print but it's like digitally saving the PDF to your folder and for pretty much all the SCO inquiries you'd want to print that out put it in the folder how would you print this page?

> P11: That's a good question. Since I'm more technology based, I know how to do a print screen and be able to do it for the older SCOs. Yeah, we have to tell them how to copy it and paste it to a Microsoft Word. So then they're able to print it as a PDF.

> P11: So it just depends on the person's doing it as far as being more technology based. It'd be great if there's a print button.

> P11: Or at least somewhere where you can. Send it to yourself because right now you don't even get this in the email. You have to log back into Ask VA. To get the, to get the response. They like your, your incident has been closed or it's been solved. Please log in to see the response. So then you have the law back in to activate to get the response.

> P11: And so. For me in order for me to keep this, yeah, I had to do a print screen and then print from our PDF.

> P11: And some SCOs who are not technically friendly. Yeah, we had to show them how to copy it and put it on Microsoft Word and print it that way.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense. And I can see how that would be useful then to have it seem pretty obvious how to print.

### Form

Tyler: We have about 15 min and I kinda wanna shift gears. This is a little bit like unplanned, but, since we have the time, I'm thinking about getting your feedback on the actual form. So the actual like submission. So if If you want, you can keep sharing your screen and then, I'm just gonna pull up. The the form prototype if that's okay with you.

> P11: Okay.

Tyler: Okay. It's just gonna take me a couple of moments to find.

Tyler: Alright, so I'm gonna send this in the chat and then you can. Pull this up on your screen. You can close the other one if you like or whatever you want to do.

Tyler: Alright, so same thing where we're imagining or signed in. We're just gonna start by clicking ask a new question. We already kind of talked about that link and we're going to pretend like you're submitting an inquiry now.

Tyler: And as we do this, just talk me through things you're noticing. Or you're thinking about as we start to submit this inquiry.

> P11: Number one. Trying to figure out where Ask VA is on the VA website. That is very, so there's a way we can get that clearer where they can contact us or trying to get to this is it's very complicated on the VA website.

Tyler: Yeah, and you said contact us. Do you think that would be like a logical place for this to be?

> P11: Yeah, contact us or something or somewhere up here where you know, where you can click it. Because we tell students, oh, do Ask VA and they're like, where is it on the website? We'll be like, oh, hold on.

> P11: So as far as an SCO for business purposes. This part, we wouldn't need to know [this personal information]. But for personal for family members, yes. And then if you need to update your personal information, yeah, that right there would be great for them to update it.

> P11: So this is what I mean by the category. It'll be education benefits.

Tyler: For your role and you always using education benefits?

> P11: For my roles as SCO, yes. 

Tyler: And then when you're helping family members, it might be a bunch of different. Okay.

> P11: Right. And then underneath the category here, so this is where it can get a little confusing. Because you see how these chapters are here, but for some reason, so where's the benefits for survivors and dependence? There's nothing showing 35 beside it. You see how this has chapter 31 chapter 16, this one doesn't have 35 decide.  Oh, this can get a little complicated for students because they don't know exactly what it's called.

Tyler: Okay, and y'all are using the chapters then? To define that?

> P11: No. Okay.

Tyler: Okay.

> P11: I usually do school certified officials. This one, I'm connected to the VA through my work.

> P11: And then again, SCO. So if I was a work study, I would click the work study site.

Tyler: Okay. Okay, so depending on the type of submission you change your role.

Tyler: Okay, and now this is where it's gonna get a little funny with the prototype. So you might try and click on something and I'll have to guide you to what the prototype wants you to click, but tell me what we're seeing here.

> P11: Okay, so now it's asking for the school facility in your profile. So each school has their own facility code. With their name is associated with their name. So it's actually, you, you want to use the school facility in your profile.

> P11: Huh.

> P11: So might as well be correct output yes. But it never gave me an option to choose a different one. So this is new.

> P11: For that facility code, do you use the facility? Like if it said, let's say we didn't know what your school facility was, we forgot or something and you had to re put it in would you use this facility code or would you like type in the name of the school?

> P11: We would use the facility code. Okay, the facility is what associated with the school as far as the main is main branch.

> P11: It's the same thing what we call the SCO hotline in order for them to verify us the access for our facility code in name of the school. So we were getting the facility code.

Tyler: Okay. Okay, that makes sense. So here, and I can't remember. I remember you said you had like satellite campuses, but do you have one school? Would it be like one facility? Okay.

> P11: Yeah, we have we have one. Exactly. We have one main branch. And then we have 6 extension branches. So we would use the main one.

Tyler: Okay. Okay, gotcha. So for this, it would probably be like your school facility is the one in your profile because you always have the same one and you would just click yes.

> P11: Yeah. Yeah.

Tyler: Okay, so let's pretend like you have 2 schools and you're like, okay, this is my one school, but I actually am submitting for a different school.

> P11: Then I would choose no, I would choose a different option. Yeah, we do have some schools that have 2 main branches that the SCO, charge up all of it.

> P11: So yes, they will probably choose the different one. So when this question comes up, it actually need to actually list the facility code because it right now just says the school.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

> P11: So if we actually had the facility code beside the school so you know you're choosing the right one. That would be great.

Tyler: Yeah. I could see that. So rather than like having you answer this question. It would just show you like the options to your options to choose from.

> P11: Right, as I said, yeah, you can choose you can do that or like where it just says school here just put the facility code beside it but they know they're choosing the right one or if they're going to choose that one or if they need to choose a different one.

Tyler: Yeah, okay. So for this for the prototype, we're gonna click on no and we'll pretend like you need to add a different school. And then what are we seeing here?

> P11: Is this? Is this a facility code?

Tyler: Is that feeling unclear?

> P11: Yeah, because it's asking for your school state or facility. Those that the school itself or is that the code?

Tyler: The reason I'm not answering is because I I'm trying to understand what's confusing and I can see how this is not clear but describe that to me.

> P11: Okay, so it was actually for the school state. We have schools, SCOs that have different, represent schools in different states. Or it says school facilities. So school facility, are they talking about the code that VA signed to the school or are they talking about the name?

> P11: Of the school facility. So that's this is just the work facility. Yes, the facility code is the code that VA assigns to each school.

> P11: And then if you just put school facilities. I'm thinking the name, not the code. So that's why I was just wondering which one it was.

Tyler: Yeah, so that feels like it needs to be more descriptive. Yeah, I could see that.

> P11: Right.

> P11: And why is it asking like state or facility? That's what I'm wondering because it doesn't just say what's your facility code.

Tyler: Okay, yeah, I can see why that's confusing so

> P11: Oh, so even with the school state, as I said, we have SCOs who have schools for instance, they have schools everywhere. So yeah, that one could be a little confusing.

Tyler: Yeah, for sure. I can see that. Let's click on school facility and then we can kinda see if that answers or questions or makes us more confused. And so we won't be able to type here, but just talk me through this.

> P11: Yeah, so they're asking for the name. For the school facility is the name. It would make sense.

> P11: If I was them, so much easier if they would put school facility code.

> P11: It's the SCOs up here asking questions? They know their school facility code.

Tyler: Okay, yeah. Especially since you're like, you said you're like the president of the school certifying official association. So you you feel like most or all school certifying officials are going to know their facility code?

> P11: Yeah, because you can't even use the [system] until you get assigned a facility code. So wouldn't know their facility code.

> P11: Even if they search by the school, let's say my school is up here, in [school].

> P11: But again, all 6 campuses are is listed. So then there's we have to make sure we do our main one. But if you just ask for the facility code and then have that facility code, just pull up the school name.

> P11: It's be a lot easier.

Tyler: Okay, so it's a lot easier to like get the specific correct facility if you're using the code. Yeah, I can see that. Okay.

> P11: Yeah, yeah. As a even in programming. I'll be a lot easier because then they could just pull it up directly 5 digits or whatever else but for programming it's a lot easier.

Tyler: Yeah, I can see that. Okay. Well, let's if you click on the where your mouse is right now, we'll kind of pretend like we type something in and search. And then you'll get to see what would happen. So there's no school facility codes listed here, which is obviously not meeting your expectation.

> P11: Right.

Tyler: So if this was like, it's the way this worked was like search for your school facility code and you typed in the code and then you saw a list of codes here would you be able to to kind of like read through those and figure out the right one.

> P11: Yeah, I mean it could be like even if they put names city postcode, that's fine or if they put facility code and then facility code will pull up that one particular college then that would be easier.

> P11: Like, you see, school and facility code. That right there would be, that would be easier.

Tyler: Yeah. Yeah. Okay, I can see that. So I think this, I think the prototype wants to choose the 1st option in the list. So let's choose that and then we'll click continue.

Tyler: And just one more thing before we move on from the facility thing. Do you think you're like expecting like I wanna search by the facility code, but then it would be helpful to see like the facility name and code listed or just the code?

> P11: You can do the facility. I think the facility name and the code just to make sure because some codes are so close together.

Tyler: Okay. Right. Yeah.

> P11: If you put in the wrong number. It will bring up another school. So yeah, to have the name and the schools together.

Tyler: Okay, just like double confirmation that makes sense. I was thinking they probably could look quite similar. Okay, so now we're on this page. Tell me what we're seeing on this page.

> P11: So this is just information about your account. So is this your contact number, your name? Yeah, just information verify your account.

Tyler: Okay. Do you have to fill out the whole page?

> P11: No. Like this is new. The pronouns, preferred name. That's new. Usually it just asks for the phone or our email address.

Tyler:  So when you are using Ask VA, you're signing in through, is it ID.me that you're using? Okay, so when you use your ID.me, that's your personal email, right?

> P11: It depends. I did my work email when I signed up for. I, But I do know some, yes, do you have the personal, especially once our veterans themselves. Yeah, it went through the personal one. So they, sometimes they're able to change it. Sometimes they just kept it as a personal one.

Tyler: Okay. And so in that case, like right here, it would show up with their personal email address.

Tyler: Do you think that they're changing it every time? So it gets sent to their business one.

> P11: Probably so.

Tyler: Yeah, okay. Okay, let's continue. I see we've got like 3 min left.

> P11: Okay.

Tyler: Oh, it should hopefully lets you continue. Let's try and click one more time. No, there we go.

Tyler: Does this look familiar? Okay.

> P11: Yes, so actually the reason why you contact them. I wanna say something nice, that's new. I have a suggestion that's new. Yeah, a lot of I usually look for I have a question.

Tyler: Okay, do you put I had a question even if it's like a work study submission?

> P11: Yes, usually, yeah, usually for the work that. They are wanting to come up this is just be a submission. So for the work study, I will probably put other. And then do the submission, but for like the inquiry, stuff like that, I usually put ask a question.

> P11: But yeah, yeah, this is new.

Tyler: Okay, gotcha. You're not the 1st person to laugh at some of these options today.

Tyler: Oh, let's click on other. I think that's what we need to click on in this one and then we can click continue.

> P11: So yeah, this is I was talking about the subject, the question. And then select files, like, files used to not be on the same page, so it's good that they're all on the same page now. This used to be on a different page. So it should make it a lot easier now for veterans. To make sure they submit the right documentation.

Tyler: Yeah, I can see that for sure. Okay, we'll like we'll pretend like you put in a question here and you can click continue. And then where are we now?

> P11: Now this is the summary of everything. I used to not show all this. And then, yeah. This is a lot better than what it used to, it used to not even show that it's usually for the summary.

> P11: It'll show you the question, but it won't show your attachments, but now a little show that you attached it to it.

Tyler: Okay, cool. Okay. Do you usually read this kind of thing or you just kind of submit? Cause you You feel like you checked.

> P11: I usually, well sometimes no, I usually read my question to make sure I'm making sense. But sometimes you're typing stuff as, so I usually read the question to make sure I'm, making sense.

> P11: I, this part of it, I use the review. Then make sure that attachments are attached.

Tyler: Alright. And I see we're at the hour. I don't wanna take any more of your time then I asked for but. That was really helpful to watch you go through that. It seemed like there was some pretty clear confusion points around the facility.

### Cool down

Tyler: Is there anything else that you notice that might be kind of a hurdle for someone like yourself?

> P11: It can be time consuming, as I said, as far as the contact information, stuff like that, I understand why they needed for Veterans, but for the business side. That might be a little time confusing and verifying.

> P11: And just the structure of the facilities and stuff like that.

Tyler: Yeah. Okay.

Tyler: You're welcome to stop sharing your screen whenever you like. There should be a button up at the top. Awesome. That was really helpful.

Tyler: We, we were really here to get your feedback on some of the stuff we're working on in the dashboard, but it was an extra bonus to watch you go through that form. We definitely wanna make sure we're not like disrupting your workflow as their changes made to this.

Tyler: So. It's really helpful to get your feedback.

> P11: Yeah, I think it'll be great especially for because right now for the feedback once the VA gets a response to send you an email. But to actually see it on the dashboard too. I don't know that's in practice and stuff like that.

> P11: It could be very helpful. As far as seeing it on the dashboard to see what their progress is with it, because yeah, usually most time I will submit something and they forget about it and jogging the email.

> P11: Like, oh shoot. But, that it looks pretty good. But as I said, yeah, trying to get to Ask VA.

> P11: If there's somewhere where that can be clearer, just try and just go because you know the VA. I'm just trying to just go because you know the VA. That guy has so many links.

> P11: So if it can be somewhere where it's quick and find where they can just go, find contact us and click it. It'll be great for family members also for SCOs instead of us searching for trying to figure out what, where to go to actually go.

Tyler: Yeah, for sure. I could definitely see that. And it was helpful to hear like kind of where you might expect for it to be.

Tyler: Well, thank you so much for your time, [P11]. If you have any other like follow-up questions or comments, you have my email so you feel free to reach out.

Tyler: And thanks for spending the hour with us and I can't wait to read through everything you shared. And see how we can fix things.

> P11: Thank you guys. You have a nice day.

Tyler: Okay. Bye!
