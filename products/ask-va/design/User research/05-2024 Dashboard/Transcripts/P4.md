### Warm up

Tyler: Okay. So I started recording. And I just want to confirm again that you are comfortable if I record my screen and audio today?

> P4: Yes, ma'am.

Tyler: Okay. Awesome.

Tyler: Well, thank you. [P4]. Do you have any questions for me at this point?

> P4: Not at this point, no ma'am.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: Alrighty. Well, it seems like we're ready to get started. I'd love to just kind of start by learning a little bit about you and your experience with the VA. How long have you been a Veteran?

> P4: Since XX of 1981.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: And did you start interacting with the VA right when you got out of service, or only in the last 20 years or so?

> P4: No, ma'am, within, I would say, within the 1st year after being discharged.

Tyler: Yeah. So you've got. You've got quite a long experience with the VA then. How do you usually contact the VA?

> P4: Well it was through calling at first, when I was discharged, we didn't have the Internet.

> P4: But once I became aware of the Internet got comfortable using it. I did start using it to contact anybody that I needed or set up anything.

Tyler: And when you started using the Internet to contact people at the VA, describe to me, what that means. Were you filling out forms? How are you getting in touch with people online?

> P4: Most of the time it was I used it mainly to do view appointments and do my prescriptions.

Tyler: Okay. So mostly medical stuff.

> P4: Yes, ma'am.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. If you have a question that's not about medical things that you need to ask the VA, how would you get in touch with them? What do you think you'd do?

> P4: Generally I call my... Let me think of what they call... It's the office that you call when you need your representative. I can't think of what they're called. You probably know what I'm talking about. I will call them and ask whatever question I have.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense.

Tyler: Do you know, if you've ever heard of something called, Ask VA.

> P4: I have heard of it. Don't really know much about it.

Tyler: Okay, that's totally fine. So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna show you ask the A because we're gonna be talking about it a little bit today. It's totally fine that you they might not have used it yet. So I'm gonna share my screen really quick. You're gonna be able to see what I'm seeing.

Tyler: So this is Ask VA.

Tyler: It's an online tool that that veterans and other people can use to ask the VA a question.

Tyler: So you can ask questions about different topics like it might be about healthcare or housing assistance, for example.

Tyler: And, so, I'll pause there. Is that making sense?

> P4: Yes, ma'am.

Tyler: Okay. So it's kind of like a contact form. We've probably used one of those on another website before?

Tyler: And what we're gonna do is we're gonna pretend like you're familiar with. Ask? Va, okay, we're gonna pretend like you've used this a couple of times in the past to ask the VA a question.

Tyler: Okay, you have any questions about Ask VA right now?

> P4: No, I'm there.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: Alright. So I stopped sharing my screen. And now we're gonna shift gears a little bit. So I'm gonna actually have you share your screen with me. So I'm gonna you're on your computer right?

> P4: Yes, ma'am, laptop.

Tyler: Okay. So I'm gonna share a link in the chat on zoom. So I just sent you a link. It's a pretty long link, and it'll show up in the chat

Tyler: And let me know once you've opened that up.

> P4: It's doing its thing.

Tyler: Okay.

> P4: And there we go. Yes, ma'am, it's open.

Tyler: Okay, perfect. And have you shared your screen on zoom before.

> P4: No, ma'am.

Tyler: Okay. So if you...

> P4: Somebody else shared theirs, but I never shared mine.

Tyler: Okay. Well, we can do that together today. So if you come back to the zoom window where you can see my face.

> P4: Okay.

> P4: All right.

Tyler: You're back there. So now, if you move your mouse over my face and you'll start to see at the bottom there's a couple of different icons.

Tyler: And there's 1 that should be green in the middle. Do you see that one?

> P4: Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

Tyler: Perfect. So if you click on that, it's gonna ask you to choose between a bunch of different screens.

Tyler: So you'll try and look for that one. We just opened it should have some blue, and it says, Ask VA.

> P4: Let's see. Yeah. Figma.

Tyler: Yeah, that sounds right.

> P4: Clicking on it, but.

Tyler: Okay. So once you click on it, you might have to click like, save, or something in the right corner. Do you...

> P4: Oh, okay.

Tyler: Do you see a button there?

> P4: Got it.

Tyler: Perfect awesome. So now I can see your screen. So it says, Ask VA. What we're looking at here is this is Ask VA. We're gonna pretend like you're signed in. So it says up here. It says Jordan. Up in the right hand corner. We're gonna pretend like that, says [P4]. Okay, so we're in your account.

Tyler: And you've signed in. And now here we are.

> P4: Yeah, it says Jordan. Up in the top right corner.

Tyler: Perfect. Okay.

Tyler: So first off, feel free to scroll around, we won't click on anything yet but as you scroll around, can you tell me what you're noticing on this page.

> P4: Alright! Let's see.

Tyler: Are you trying to scroll down?

> P4: And it's not letting me.

Tyler: It's not letting you. Hmm! Are you trying to use your keyboard to do that?

> P4: I was trying to use my mouse first and now trying the keyboard.

Tyler: Hmm.

> P4: And it is stuck on the initial thing. I'm gonna move my screen that we're on.

Tyler: Yeah. Why don't.

Tyler: Let's try this. Why don't you? Why don't you try and click on that plus sign? Do you see that plus sign kind of in the middle of the screen.

Tyler: Why don't we try clicking on that?

Tyler: Okay? And then can we try and scroll from there just with your mouse... ah, still not working.

> P4: No...

Tyler: Why don't...

> P4: Keyboard. Well. Still getting nothing with.

Tyler: Getting nothing.

Tyler: Okay, let's try one more thing, and then, if that doesn't work, I have a backup plan.

> P4: Okay.

Tyler: So why don't we try and refresh this page? Do you know how to do that?

> P4: Yeah, yeah. Give me a minute while it loads. Okay.

> P4: It is restarted.

Tyler: Okay. And then, can you, are you able to kind of like, push your mouse down... Still not working?

> P4: No, I am getting nothing with the mouse or down there. Okay.

Tyler: Yeah, sorry. That's frustrating. That's a little bit weird. I don't. I don't exactly know why it's doing that.

Tyler: So we have 2 options. One option is you can play around with it for a couple of minutes, and I'll just be quiet and you can take your time.

Tyler: The other option is, I can share my screen and I'll show you this same website, and you'll just have to tell me where to click and things like that.

> P4: Okay.

Tyler: What do you prefer?

> P4: I think I've tried everything possible. So.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: Sounds good. So why don't I try and share my screen? So there's going to be something up towards the top of your screen that says, stop sharing.

> P4: Let's see today, stop share. Yup.

> P4: And that's right.

Tyler: Perfect. So now just give me a minute. I'm gonna open it up on my side.

Tyler: And it's no big deal that I'm going to share on my screen instead of us looking at your screen, it just means that you're gonna have to tell me when to scroll. So if you would naturally want to scroll down. You gotta tell me, and then I'll scroll down for you. Okay.

> P4: Okay.

Tyler: Alright, so you can see my screen now.

> P4: Yes, yep, sure can.

Tyler: Perfect. Okay.

### Dashboard

Tyler: Alright. So we're on Ask VA. We're pretending like you're signed into your account.

Tyler: And the 1st question I asked was, what are you noticing on this page?

> P4: Okay, I've got when to use Ask VA. Plus sign, so I can open that up if I want to.

> P4: Your questions.

> P4: Last updated, status, dates as to when it would have been, I guess it's when it would have been last opened.

> P4: New and solved, so tells you the status of it.

> P4: Check details so I can get even further information on it.

> P4: And each box gives me what the category of the question would have been.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: So that was a lot of information that was really helpful. The one of the 1st things you noticed was, the dates, you said there's a bunch of dates, and I guess this might have been the date it was last updated.

Tyler: Is that what you said?

> P4: Yes, ma'am.

Tyler: Which date can you give me an example of which date, so I know what we're looking at.

> P4: The top left one. May the 26th last updated.

> P4: And the top right last update is May the 25th. The last update that the top of it says, May the 21st.

Tyler: Right. Yeah, why is that different?

> P4: May 21st would have been when it was originally where the question was originally asked. The last updated is the last date that whoever is answering questions would have been doing something on it.

Tyler: Okay, yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: So there's the day you submitted it. And then there's like the last update might be from the VA?

> P4: That's right.

Tyler: Okay, cool. And then.

Tyler: You talked about the status you said this one has the status new. What does that mean? Status, new?

> P4: Something that would. I would have just been typing into the box of some kind of question I had. And that hasn't been worked on by me or you.

Tyler: Okay, got it

Tyler: So that one hasn't been worked on yet by the Va. But you have typed in the box your question, right?

> P4: Right, yeah.

Tyler: Okay. And then what about this one where it says, solved, what does that mean?

> P4: Something that the VA has answered as far as the question they presented me. What they've done to answer it, or what I needed for it be answered.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: Great. So somehow this has been answered, probably by the VA.

Tyler: Okay, cool. That makes sense. And then you said something about was it like the category, or something like that?

> P4: Yeah, at the top, where the date is, there. In light blue.

> P4: One says sign in and technical issues. One says healthcare.

Tyler: Yeah, I see those. And so what is that? Why do you think that's there?

> P4: Well, you're gonna have different things that they want. And you need to have different categories so that they know what you're talking about.

Tyler: Yeah. That makes sense. So it helps them understand kind of like what you're talking about is there, any other reason there might be a category here?

Tyler: Is it helpful for you?

> P4: Yes.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P4: Yes, then I don't have to explain everything picking a category. They know kind of the idea of where I'm coming from. And I don't have to get as focused on it.

Tyler: Okay. So they give. They get like a general idea.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: And then, right, when we kind of got to this page, you mentioned that you could. There's last updated here, and then there's status, and it says, newest to oldest and all.

> P4: Right.

Tyler: Can you describe to me what those are, how and how you'd use them?

> P4: Last update would let me know if you've done anything on it, because, like, I use the claims portion of the VA website, and that lets me know if they've worked on it. Since the last time I checked in, which is very helpful.

> P4: The status I can pick which ones that I won't pick that. Or, in this example, all of them that's been worked on or currently being worked on so I could pick. I'm sure it would show me like this, whether it's new, or solved or whatever.

Tyler: Okay, Gotcha, cool. That that makes sense. And that's a helpful comparison. You talked about the claim status and being able to check when things are last updated.

Tyler: When you're checking your claim status. Is there any information there that's helpful to you that you kind of wish was here? For example. Maybe it tells you who's working on your claim, or anything like that.

> P4: No, just if I can see that the dates are progressing. I think it's 5 categories for the claims to go through.

> P4: If they're moving through instead of just new and solved. I like how we can go through the categories of their reviewing it. They're now getting like, when I say, Okay, get blah blah blah from blah blah blah, it shows that they're working through that then it shows that they're going to work on a letter or whatever, and that they closed it out.

> P4: So that part is helpful with it.

Tyler: Yeah, so that that kind of step by step process you're obviously familiar with now, because you've done it before. But also it's kinda intuitive to you. It's like we're here. And then somebody's working on it under review. And then eventually, it's close. Yeah, I can see how that's similar to the status that we're seeing here. Let's look at all the statuses. So I just open up this status toolbar. And it says all which is obviously what we talked about earlier, but it looks like we can have new in progress, solved and reopened.

Tyler: Can you tell me about some of those? What do those all mean to you?

> P4: All, of course, is, I just want to see everything that's been happening new is something recently submitted. So yeah, that's fine. In progress, that's a little broad. The end the claim,  it tells me where it is in progress. Not just the general really widely. We're doing something, you know. Solved is what they usually use the closed for so close. I do like the reopened. We don't have that. If I resubmit it just shows I've resubmitted, and that you know I've done an appeal, and then it's kind of like going through the whole thing. So I kinda like the reopen deal. So I can keep track of.

> P4: I'm in the appeal and everything with it. And then after that, if it had reopened in progress, and the subcategories and the solve and stuff, if I had that after the reopened so I could see where it is, and that so I can keep well what's new, in progress, and then what's reopened, in progress. If that makes sense to you.

Tyler: That does make sense. So for your claims, the way that they don't have reopened does it just open like a new case?

> P4: Right.

Tyler: Okay. So you're saying, you kind of like how it's all tied together. And it's showing a more. It's a more detailed explanation of how the case is being handled.

> P4: Right.

Tyler: Yeah, okay, that makes sense. So in progress is a little vague. It's not giving like as much description as we'd like. Solved is similar to closed.

Tyler: Why do you think it says solved here? Does that make more or less sense than closed?

> P4: Solved, closed. It means basically they're done working on it unless I reopen it with an appeal with the supplemental piece or something.

Tyler: Okay. That makes sense. Alright. And let's say. Just kind of zooming out again.

Tyler: Let's say that you had, you know, signed back into your account, because you remembered that a long time ago you asked a question about home loans, and you couldn't remember what the Va. Told you. But you were like, I know. They answered this question for me. I just can't remember what they told me.

Tyler: So you came here, and you wanted to try and find that old question.

Tyler: and I know we only have 3 questions here. But what if we had a lot of questions? How would you find that old question about home loans. What would you do?

> P4: Where it says, last updated, I would expect to be able to click to there, like, yeah, what you just did, and go all this to newest.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: So you'd know it was an older question. So you'd probably filter it that way. And.

> P4: Right.

Tyler: Let's say that they all shifted so everything was now oldest to newest. There's still there's still a couple of questions to look through. What are you? Are you scanning? What are you scanning for? How are you gonna find the question?

> P4: I would scan for the word loan.

> P4: If that's the only thing I've been doing, I would just... oh, excuse me, sorry I would just be scanning for the word loan.

Tyler: Okay. That makes sense.

Tyler: All right.

> P4: How about? Oh, I'm sorry.

Tyler: You go ahead.

> P4: Although what would be nice is, I mean, it's fine to have the last updated. It's fine to have the status, but if you had the things like. Is it healthcare? Is it VA loans? Is it? Medical care, like prescriptions and different things, that that was a a sub box that you had to the right with it. That would be nice where you could do checks on whatever.

Tyler: Yeah, that sounds helpful. So another way of of sorting these cards could be by the category which we talked about earlier like it says, healthcare or housing assistance. Yeah, that makes sense to me.

> P4: I was an analyst at a fortune 500 company and the accounts receivable. So I look at things a little bit different.

> P4: You know. Then some might. So I'm always trying to figure out how to arrange things and how to set things up. So if I get out there, just let me know.

Tyler: No, no, that's really helpful. I think any kind of ideas are really awesome to hear. So  you've been great so far.

Tyler: Okay. So we talked about, we have these 3 questions in here. We kind of know how we would search around and find different ones, and we talked about some of the things that are inside each of these boxes.

### Question details

Tyler: How would you read your reply from the VA? What would you do?

> P4: The check details should give it.

Tyler: Yeah. Okay, so why don't we say at this point, you know, we're ready to check your reply for this question. That you submitted on May 21st.

> P4: Right.

Tyler: Okay. So I'm gonna go ahead and click check details.

> P4: Okay.

Tyler: Okay, and then talk to me about what we're seeing now.

> P4: Okay, this right here, where I see the send a reply is where I can ask a question about it, maybe why it's solved, or I've got a question as to what my steps are next.

> P4: But I would also expect to see why they considered it solved. Either in a PDF that I can click or have some kind of quick reply. There, if it's something that only a small paragraph could do.

Tyler: Yeah. That makes sense. So right away, we're seeing like, yes, this says it's solved it says, I can send a reply, but it's not really giving me information about why it's solved.

> P4: And I would have that above the sender reply, I would have the sender reply, up under everything.

> P4: So if I want to, I can, or if I don't want to, I can. But the information that I need needs to be the highest up on the list.

Tyler: And what's that information that you need?

Tyler: Can you summarize that?

> P4: It says, solved. Why do they consider it solved? And what next steps options would be? Even that would be fine.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense so sender, replies, kind of like the last option.

Tyler: It is just an option. You might not need to send a reply.

> P4: Exactly. Yeah.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P4: But if it's down there at the bottom, then I can always cancel. That's fine, too.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. Do you want me to scroll any further?

> P4: Probably nothing there, but we'll see... Okay, conversation. Here we go. Yeah, that just makes more sense to be above the reply.

> P4: Because I might, would see the reply, and just not click in my head that I still need to go with under there like this further questions you may call in blah blah blah blah blah. Well, I should have seen that right off the bat.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. I think it was interesting to see that even without seeing that this was missing, you described the page to me kinda how you wish. And it would really just be shifting these 2 things right? So that makes sense. You'd want to have most important information is, why is it solved? What has the VA told me? And then maybe the option to reply.

> P4: Yeah. And the need help is fine that can stay on the bottom. Cause that's kind of general back to the top. And all of that.

> P4: That's fine. That part can stay. But you need to switch the order.

Tyler: Yeah. That makes sense. I totally hear that. I'm going to give you a minute to read a little bit of the detail in their response.

> P4: Okay.

Tyler: All right. So, just having, after reading their response, is that kind of what you were expecting from the VA. Or is there anything different?

> P4: I think it's pretty much describes it the one thing that I would let people know, and we just discovered it the end of last year. And I've been dealing like I said, I've been dealing with the VA since [the 80's], is the caregiver program, and they offer the chat VA through that. So with saying, you know, we, we provide this to the families and everything, I think they should mention that program is also available. And they offer chat VA through there.

> P4: I know you work for the Va. And I'm not putting that down.

> P4: But the one problem that I've seen from the VA is they don't give you all of the information that is pertinent to whatever the case or whatever thing should be. You have to dig and dig and dig, and if you don't know what you're looking for, you don't know that it exists like this. It mentions nothing about there about chat Va.

> P4: Is eligible for that, and it is eligible for family members, so you know, tell them. Don't just keep it compacted. Tell them for family and members. You can also go through the caregiver program as well with it and get the chat VA.

> P4: Does that make sense?

Tyler: That does make sense. Yeah.

> P4: Not giving everything that's available for not only me, but for every other bedroom I've talked to. You have to dig, and if you don't know what you're supposed to be digging for. There's a lot of things you really just. You happen to find it by chance. You don't, you know, all of the information you need is not given to you.

Tyler: Right. I totally get that. And I think I mean, I get to talk to a lot of veterans like yourself, and it seems like it's a common feeling of, "I wish that the VA wouldn't just respond to like this one thing, because I don't really know what to ask about, like I've heard of this program. But can't you tell me about all the other programs instead of just saying, no, sorry you can't do this one." So I think that kind of like broad perspective of being like, maybe this one will work for you instead, is what a lot of Veterans are hoping for.

> P4: Exactly. Exactly. You are getting what I'm talking about.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And I think also, there's probably a little. I mean, you talked about maybe having to dig for the information. There's probably a it could be a little bit clearer how the VA is responding to you?

Tyler: Okay and what about this? So right now, you've asked a question, the VA has responded. And we're seeing it here. Is there anything else that could show up in this conversation area?

> P4: I can't think of anything.

> P4: Besides, what I told you. Yes, so.

Tyler: That makes sense.

Tyler: So we've got this one response. And let's say that we were still kind of confused like we read this reply from the VA. We weren't really understanding it. We wanted to ask a follow up question.

Tyler: We talked about this, send a reply already. So I know that you know this is here. So I can't actually type in the prototype today. But describe to me what you would be doing here? If you wanted to write a reply.

> P4: Click inside the box and either tell them or ask them something about their replacement.

> P4: And then, if I had like maybe I had a form, or I had a file that I need to kind of back up what I'm saying, or something that I've downloaded, and it left me with more questions. I would do the select files to upload and do whatever. Then hit. Send.

Tyler: Okay, awesome. That makes sense. That sounded pretty straightforward. So instead of typing, I'm just gonna click in this box, and we'll pretend like we typed in this message.

Tyler: And so I'm gonna click, send now, like you said.

Tyler: And now I'll give you a minute to read this page.

Tyler: Okay, so tell me about this page. What is it telling you.

> P4: It lets me know that my question, answer whatever it was, didn't get lost in the world. Wide Web. The one thing about this, for me, that would help is this last sentence. If we need more information to answer your question, we'll contact you. How will you contact me? Phone call? Should I be watching for email? So watching my spam in case it falls there? Are you gonna send me a secure message? What is the normal way for you to contact me? I mean, you could use any of the others.

Tyler: Yeah, that's a great question. So it's not clear how they'd get back in touch with you if they needed more information. What about in general, like, let's say they didn't need more information from you. They were like, Okay, cool. We can just answer your question, how are they? Gonna answer like, how are they gonna reply to you? How are they? Gonna send that to you? Is that unclear, too?

> P4: Most of the time, when you get a reply from them, and they consider it closed. You get it by mail.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: So you're thinking, the VA is gonna consider like the question, or the situation, or the case, or whatever closed. And they'll send you something in the mail, and that'll kind of be the end of it.

> P4: Right, right.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P4: I can still appeal, usually not if it's got it, but otherwise, then yeah, there's nothing further.

Tyler: Yeah. And, does this, or should this work the same as the case the claims process? Or is this different? What we're looking at now.

> P4: No, it's pretty close to it. Only with the claims it 7 business days. I mean otherwise. Yeah.

Tyler: And is that because the claims process is much longer?

> P4: Yes, ma'am, it's much longer it's I've noticed it's taking months just to get through each part.

Tyler: Okay. So we're on this page, we've submitted our our follow up question to the VA and how would you get back to to that Ask VA homepage?

> P4: About 2 thirds of the way down on the left. It says, to return to Ask VA.

Tyler: And if I click this, can you describe to me what you think we'll see next?

> P4: It should go back to the homepage of the Ask VA.

Tyler: I'll go ahead and click on that.

Tyler: And that's kind of what you were expecting?

> P4: Right, right, yeah.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense. So we're back on this page where we started. And I'm just gonna scroll down a little bit so you can see your questions. And are we noticing any anything else about this page?

> P4: Nothing that I can say.

Tyler: Yeah. Sounds good.

Tyler: One thing I want to point out, which maybe we haven't noticed yet, and is totally okay, is it looks like one of this questions. The status has changed.

Tyler: Do you see that?

> P4: I can't remember what I'll do.

Tyler: That's okay.

Tyler: That's helpful for me to know, because at the minute something changed on this page. But it's not obvious to you that something changed, and that's helpful feedback.

> P4: If it says reopened, I would do the check details to see if I can find where it was in the line. And the solved. I would check the detail to look and see what the last thing was. Did they get any forms, and did they look through that before they did the solve, just to make sure that they received everything acknowledge that they work through it?

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. Okay. So you're seeing that it says reopened, which seems different. But you're not exactly sure why. And you'd probably go check the details to see why, what has happened? Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: And the order of the questions also changed.

Tyler: So it looks like it says, like, May 21st for this 1st one, and then May 26th. And then we have October 13th. Why is it in that order?

> P4: The top left is the I would think would be the last one that you have done anything on your end.

Tyler: Okay.

> P4: So whatever you did, you've done after May the 26th, and which is correct, if you look last updated May 27th.

Tyler: So it's based on the last update?

Tyler: And does the last update is that reflecting updates that you make to your questions or the Va. Makes, or maybe both.

> P4: Yes, I think it could be either one. Me or them.

Tyler: Yeah, I could see that makes sense.

Tyler: So this one changed to reopened because we just submitted a a follow-up question to the VA. So that's the reason it says reopened. Now.

> P4: Okay.

Tyler: So it went from solved to reopened. Does that feel intuitive? Or is that confusing.

> P4: No, reopened, I would think, would be where we would be in the appeal process. Because, I would think generally that comes after closed. If you have evidence or have whatever for them to consider, then the reopened is where I think, that falls into.

Tyler: Yeah, okay, that makes sense. So, and when you talk about it makes sense because of the appeal process, are you comparing it to the comp the appeal process? Or does this feel like it's the same thing. Does that make sense?

> P4: I didn't quite follow you.

Tyler: Yeah. That's okay. I guess I'm trying to get a sense for like is what we're looking at right now. Does this have anything to do with the appeal process? Or are you just finding comparisons?

> P4: The reopened just sounds like the appeal. Sounds like just something you've renamed. But. Maybe reopened for appeal.

> P4: May would be a little bit better for somebody to understand. Why was it reopened? Did you find something? Did I find something?

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense, I mean. And that reminds me of earlier on when we talked about solved. And you were like, I kind of understand what that means. Like, why is it solved? Not just like, okay. You say it's solved.

Tyler: Okay, you say it's reopened. So a little bit of help understanding why it is that way.

> P4: Correct. Right now they use the term closed.

> P4: Well, I have to wait several weeks to find out why they consider it closed.

> P4: If if I had a little bit more of something that I could look online and not have to wait for weeks until I get something in the mail that further tells me more about it. I mean, you know the one thing you use the Internet, or at least, in my opinion.

> P4: The one thing we use the Internet is to be able to get information faster.

> P4: I mean, if you're going to help somebody to be able to get information faster. Why are you not giving them the information? And you're still using the paper to be able to pay, and that's fine to send it. I have no problem with that.

> P4: But why not give them both. At the same time, and not make them wait.

Tyler: Yeah, for sure.

> P4: I have it online, I can refer to it, or I can have a print copy, you know, when you send it off in the mail.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. I can totally see why one, it's delivered to you faster. But also you have a reference that you can come back to online.

> P4: Right.

Tyler: Yeah, I get that. Is this tool that we're looking at right now, somewhere where you could submit a new claim?

> P4: I'm not sure with the way this is set up, that it would allow you.


Tyler: Yeah. If it's not for claims, what is it for?

> P4: It's more informational.

Tyler: Okay.

> P4: Think you have to go to the claimed, you know part part of the website to be able to upload either a resubmittle, or to to, you know, do whatever that you want to do with it.

> P4: This is more for information truthfully.

Tyler: Gotcha. Okay. So there's a difference between kind of like actually submitting your claim and having that reviewed and going through that process. And then, maybe, like asking questions about the claims process would be more informational. Yeah.

> P4: I mean the title says your questions.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P4: That really point to just claims. And you know, you've got on here healthcare dial in and technically issues housing. So I mean, you've got different categories that are not really a part of the claim. The rest of them don't really apply to it.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. That's helpful clarification for me.

### Cool down

Tyler: We have a couple of minutes left. But I'm gonna stop sharing my screen in a minute. Is there anything else you wanted to tell me about this while we're still looking at it?

> P4: No. I mean nothing there, you know, nothing more than you know what I've talked to. You.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: Okay. Cool.

> P4: General. No, I'm fine.

Tyler: That's okay. I'll stop sharing my screen, and we still have time to kind of reflect.

> P4: Okay. One thing in general, I love my VA app. I can go check on appointments, prescriptions, or I can look at my claims and stuff on there. It would be great if this was added to that app. I know we're not talking about that right now. But to be able to ask VA. That would be great to have in the app so that I can look at it real quick.

Tyler: Yeah, it's more convenient. Well, that's good. It's good the app is working well for you and

Tyler: and I can see why having things like more together, has not always been the VA strong suit. And so I I think, I I think that makes a lot of sense is trying to bring everything to one place. So it's a little more convenient for you and other Veterans.

Tyler: We talked a lot about a lot of different specifics in that process, like some of the ways. Maybe the statuses could be more specific, or we talked about. Maybe, like your reply should be at the bottom of the page.

Tyler: What did you like about that process? What would you keep?

> P4: I mean, like, I said, add the different things that we talked about, but otherwise I mean it's not bad, being able to go to it. And you know, being able to look up the different things, the different headings, titles, or whatever you want to call them.

> P4: With that I like that. It's pretty easy to understand. So you know which one you need.

> P4: You know, as far as whatever your questions going to be.

> P4: I think that would work.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: That makes sense.

Tyler: Well, I think that's good. Good news. I'll that's kind of the end of my questions. I can tell you a little bit about this tool. So I showed you it at the very beginning. And this is something that you can currently use but it's not on va.gov, that's on its own website. It's not part of the app.

Tyler: And so we're working on moving this to va.gov, and it'd be a little easier for you to find it and to use it in the future.

Tyler: So that's kind of where we're at right now, and getting your feedbacks really helpful cause we can make some changes as we move it to va.gov

> P4: When you move it to va.gov. Are you planning to move it, you know, and va.gov, I can't remember exactly, but it's got kind of the a list of the different things about your medicine. Do your benefits you know things like that. So pretty long list. Are you going to move this into that list, or is it gonna be something that stands out when you hit VA.gov.

> P4: Where is your team thinking about that, it needs to go.

Tyler: Well, where do you think it would make sense to go.

> P4: I think it goes with that list.

Tyler: Yeah, it goes.

> P4: That list. Yeah, I mean, there's so many different things on there. And Ask VA, if it was on that, I think it would get noticed, rather than somebody just sitting VA, going to the part where it shows that list and missing it entirely. Cause they just. They're so used to ask, you know, to va.gov, being just kind of a general list. So I would put it in that list.

Tyler: Yeah, okay, that makes sense. Is that the list you see after you sign in? Or is it the list that you see anytime you're on VA.gov.

> P4: I'm trying to remember it is not on the home sheet.

> P4: I've got several of my thing bookmarks. I don't have to scroll around.

Tyler: No worries.

> P4: I can't remember where it is. But it will have different things. I mean, you look up your copay, you look up the healthcare you. There's all kind of different things you can look up on that.

> P4: So I've got different thoughts. I got different things, bookmarked.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P4: Stuff all there.

Tyler: So it'll show you like your prescriptions, or if you have like a case, that kind of thing right?

> P4: Right if you if you have what you, what it'll do is I has a link to. If you want your appointments, prescriptions or test results, or whatever, and it'll open up my e- help and then you go sign in and everything through that. And it brings it up to get a little bit more on the hillside.

Tyler: Okay, yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: So that that sounds like it's kind of like your profile. So when you sign in, you can see all the things that are like most relevant for you. And it is a long list like you said so I can see why Ask VA would make sense there. It sounds like you don't want it to be  the 1st thing, or the only thing you'd see. But it you also don't want to be lost in the mix. That makes sense.

Tyler: Awesome. Well, we've when we've been thinking about it. I can let you know we've been thinking about it in terms of how people get in touch with the VA. So right now there's a way that you can. There's like a a button that'll say, like contact us. And so if you went to that, you might have different options, and one of them would be to contact the Va online. So that that would be how you'd find. Ask Va, hopefully in the near future. But that that's helpful to understand how you're thinking about it, and I can see why, having it in that space that you already go to makes sense.

> P4: Yeah, like, I said, biggest thing is either now or in the future. Cause I know programmers takes a little bit to add to the app, to add it somewhere in the app.

> P4: Because a lot of times I go on my app like I'm waiting on Planar. I'm waiting, you know, at a doctor's office, and I've got time to kill, and so I'll go on there and see. You know, do I do I have any refills that only have 0. So I need to contact the doctor and stuff so and ask, Va, you could do while you're doing that. Oh, yeah, I need to find out this, pull the app up. It's real quick, and, you know you can do that instead of having to go and having it so small while you're using your Google Chrome, or whatever app on your on your VA app it just it would make more sense. And it would be easier for Veterans if it was as easy to get on the phone as it is on the web.

Tyler: Yeah, that's a great point. And especially, like you said, while you're doing other VA things, it might make it easier for you if it's if it's in the app as well. So that's really helpful feedback.

Tyler: We are kind of coming to the end of our session. I do want to leave any space. If you have questions for me at this point?

> P4: Nothing I can think of.

Tyler: Okay, awesome. Well, thank you so much for your time. You've shared so much helpful feedback with us. And we're excited to kind of think about it and figure out what to do next. So I appreciate it, and the folks who set up this research session. They're gonna send you a thank you. Note with some information you can pass on to other veterans if they wanna participate in research like this in the future. And if you have any questions you can let them know

Tyler: otherwise. I hope you have a lovely rest of your Tuesday.

> P4: Thank you, and I hope you do the same.

Tyler: Awesome. Thanks, [P4]. See you later.

> P4: Alright! Alright! Bye, bye.
