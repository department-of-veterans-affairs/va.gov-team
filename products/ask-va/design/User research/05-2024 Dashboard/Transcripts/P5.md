### Warm up

Tyler: Okay. So I started the recording. And I want to confirm one more time. Are you comfortable If I record my screen and audio?

> P5: Yes.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: awesome.

Tyler: So that was a lot of information. And I know it's your 1st time doing research with the VA. Do you have any questions for me at this point?

> P5: No.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: awesome. Well, before we start looking at that prototype I mentioned, and getting your feedback, I'd love to just learn a little bit more about your experience with the Va. How long have you been a veteran.

> P5: Since I enrolled for healthcare at the VA. In 2007.

Tyler: Okay, so a couple of years now, and how are you interacting with the VA right now? You said, you have health care through the VA?

> P5: Yes, I do. The majority of my healthcare through the VA. Some of it is outsourced to community care. But I don't have any non VA healthcare providers.

Tyler: Okay, and how do you usually get in touch with the VA?

> P5: Combination of secure message and phone call.

Tyler: Why might you call? Instead of using secure messaging?

> P5: I call for appointment scheduling because the appointment scheduling doesn't work on the website, even though it's been shown there for many years.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense. What if you have a question that's not about healthcare? Does that ever happen.

> P5: Sometimes I'm a healthcare provider myself, so that won't be an issue for me most of the time.

Tyler: Okay, if you were gonna ask a question that wasn't to do with healthcare for the VA, how would you think to get in touch with them?

> P5: I would message because all calls go to a call center. You can't actually call and talk to your VA anymore.

Tyler: Hmm, okay. So you'd use secure messaging.

> P5: Yeah.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. Have you ever heard of something called Ask Va?

> P5: I think I've seen it somewhere, but I haven't. Actually, I've never used it.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: Awesome. Well, just to make sure we're kind of like on the same page. I'm gonna show you ask VA. So I'll share my screen.

Tyler: This is Ask VA. It's an online tool that veterans and other people can use to ask a question.

Tyler: You can ask questions about all different topics so it could be about healthcare or housing assistance, for example.

> P5: Okay.

Tyler: It's essentially like a contact form which probably feels familiar. Right.

> P5: Yeah.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: Do you have any questions about Ask VA at this point?

> P5: Nope.

Tyler: Okay, so we're gonna pretend, like you're kind of familiar with, ask Va, so let's say that you've used it a couple of times in the past. So you've asked the Va a couple of questions.

Tyler: We'll stay in that scenario for the rest of our conversation. Okay.

Tyler: So I'm going to stop sharing my screen.

Tyler: We're gonna shift gears. And I'm actually gonna have you share your screen.

Tyler: So this will take us like a little bit of time to set up on the phone. So be patient with me. So I'm gonna send a link in the Zoom chat now.

Tyler: And it's gonna pop up on your screen, at the bottom of the top. And if you can just open that link, it's gonna open up a prototype on your browser.

Tyler: Let me know when that's open on your side.

> P5: Yep.

Tyler: Awesome. And then have you ever shared your screen on zoom on your phone?

> P5: I have.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: So that's what we're going to do next.

Tyler: And I'll give you a second to do that. If you need any help just let me know.

> P5: Sorry.

Tyler: All good.

> P5: My sliding thing doesn't want to slide.

> P5: Okay. There it goes.

Tyler: Perfect.

Tyler: So now I can see your screen and yeah, awesome. We'll go over to this Ask VA, and you can just swipe my photo out of the out of the way, like over to the right. Yeah, perfect.

Tyler: Okay, awesome.

Tyler: So now I can't see you. Because you're sharing your screen, which is totally normal. But you will just have to be a bit more verbal with me. So if, like something's confusing, or whatever, I won't be able to see your face. Okay.

> P5: Gotcha. Okay.

Tyler: Okay.

### Dashboard

Tyler: So now we're looking at Ask VA, we're going to pretend like we're signed in. So if you scroll up a little bit to the top. It's gonna say, Jordan, we're gonna pretend like that, says [P5]. And this is your account.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: So, now go ahead and scroll around as much as you like, and I'd love for you to tell me what you're noticing.

> P5: So I like that. It has a call number. If you're having trouble.

> P5: Wendy is, yeah.

> P5: okay. So I know I'm not gonna get an answer immediately.

Tyler: Business.

> P5: And it is fairly recent. So.

> P5: Excuse me, so it's up. It was update in 2023. Alright.

> P5: So when I click on, ask a new question, nothing happens.

Tyler: Yeah. So that's I can see kind of when you're clicking. Obviously, I can't see your finger. But there's certain things you're not going to be able to click on just because of the prototype. So let me know when you're gonna click on something, and then we can kind of talk about it so ask a new question. What do you think that that link would do if you did click on it?

> P5: Take me to the form that you showed me.

> P5: And so, Phil.

> P5: You know what my question is, you know who I want to talk to, and then more details about it, and how I would like a response.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: cool. That makes sense. And then you mentioned this like, when to use, ask Va information. And then it wouldn't be an immediate response. You also mentioned the contact number which I think you found at the bottom of the page

Tyler: What's in this like middle part of the page.

> P5: So it looks like previous requests that you've had.

> P5: Or previous questions you've asked, and then, if there are answers for them or not.

Tyler: okay, how can you tell from where we are right now on this screen? How can you tell if there's an answer or not?

> P5: So the status one. This one says, the second one says Solve, and there's a check mark next to it. So it's me that one sent an answer, and on their end they think it's resolved.

> P5: And then this 1st one, this May 26th one. It still says new, and it has a start next to it, so that one would not have a response yet.

Tyler: Okay. Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: So we're seeing solved. And we're seeing new. What do you think new means? Then it might feel fairly obvious. But can you describe it?

> P5: I haven't gotten a response yet.

Tyler: awesome.

Tyler: So these you did mention that these are all.

Tyler: Oh, the sound got a little funny. But you can still hear me? Right? Okay, cool. You did mention that these are all previous questions that you've asked.

Tyler: what order are these questions in.

> P5: See, it looks like their oldest to new, oldest at the bottom, newest at the top.

> P5: Which is what it says under last updated. So it looks like you can rearrange them if you click on it.

Tyler: And in.

> P5: But I'm oldest to newest instead.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: okay, cool. So it's the last updated. And then if we go, look at one of these questions.

Tyler: what? What is that date? Referring to.

> P5: I would think for this one that's still listed as new. That would be when I submitted it.

> P5: And for this one that's solved. That would be when they sent their response.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: And I'm noticing 2 dates on here, so it says, may 21st and then may 25th what is the difference between those? Or why are they different?

> P5: Would be when I submitted the question.

Tyler: Okay.

> P5: The update May 25th would be when they sent their response.

Tyler: okay, cool

Tyler: that makes sense.

Tyler: What does it mean where it says healthcare?

Tyler: Why is that there?

> P5: That should be the topic. This other one is housing assistance, and then this 1st one is sign in or check issues.

Tyler: Why is that helpful information for you? As the you know, this is your account, why is that helpful information.

> P5: Because if I know what I'm looking for a response, for I might not remember the date. I sent the request. But I'll know what I asked the question about.

> P5: So it's easier to find an answer that I'm looking for. If I have multiple entries.

Tyler: Okay, so it will help you be able to look through different entries. Cause you're using kind of like a keyword.

> P5: Yes.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: that's really helpful. Is there a way you talked about like newest to oldest and kind of how you can sort them?

Tyler: What's the next way that you can sort? Did we see another option.

> P5: Got the status, so we've got new in progress, solved and reopened.

> P5: so new to me would say they haven't read it yet in progress. They've read it, and they're working on a response solved would be. They sent a response in reopened. I didn't like the response. So I, you know, replied with some kind of clarification, question, or something.

Tyler: awesome.

Tyler: Do any of these feel unclear like, do you feel like you need any more description to understand these statuses.

> P5: No.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: awesome, and you can close out of that when you're ready. 

Tyler: let's say that you had signed in today because you remembered the VA had given you some information about home loans a while back, and you really can't remember what they told me, but I know I already asked them this. So you came here because you wanted to figure out what that response was, so you're on this page, you have multiple questions that you've asked at different times.

Tyler: How are you gonna find that question that you're looking for?

> P5: I would go to status and look for solved.

> P5: And then, if that didn't narrow down enough like, if if I knew it was a while ago, I would probably switch from newest to oldest, to oldest, to newest, and backwards that way.

Tyler: Okay. that makes sense. awesome. So at this point, is there anything else you want to share with me about this page? Maybe anything you would change.

> P5: Don't think so.

Tyler: alright, that's cool. So let's say that you wanted to check, you wanted to like, read your reply for this most recently solved question.

Tyler: Can you show me what you would do next?

> P5: I would click on the check details button.

### Question details

> P5: And so here's the response at the bottom.

> P5: And that gives me information on where to go and what to do. And it gives me phone number to call if I have further questions, but it also gives me the option to send a reply.

Tyler: so you scrolled kind of like, right away, you found that reply, from the VA.

> P5: Right.

Tyler: And you. It seems like you were skimming it pretty quickly, too. So you already read a little bit of what they told you?

Tyler: I know that this isn't a question you've actually asked the Va, but the question is essentially someone saying, I have a 70% disability rating. Can I get my dependence healthcare coverage as well? And this is the response. So reading this response, I'm gonna give you a minute to read it properly. But let me know if this reply is what you're expecting from a a tool like this.

> P5: So to me, this answers my question.

> P5: My dependence would not be eligible for healthcare, because I don't meet the requirements.

> P5: but that there are other options I can reach out to the patient advocate.

> P5: To see if there are any other options.

Tyler: Yeah. Okay, so it feels like it's answering your question and maybe giving you a next step. Since this, this was sort of a no.

> P5: Right.

Tyler: Is there anything that you feel like is missing from their reply?

> P5: No, I don't think so. I just think for me, it makes more sense to have the response at the top, and then, if I need to send by that would go after that.

> P5: It just seems weird.

> P5: Send a reply. I don't. I don't know what I'm replying to, because I haven't got to the message yet.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: totally. And I can see you scrolling between the top and the bottom and kind of skipping over that middle. Yeah, so what what order makes sense? We've got like your question. We've got the questions, details, and then we have.

> P5: Response.

> P5: Find the responsibility next.

> P5: And then send a reply after the response. If I want any further clarifying information. Or you know, maybe I tried that phone number and it didn't work or something.

Tyler: yeah.

Tyler: do you feel like, there's any information about your question that's missing here, like, we've got kind of the same thing, we saw on the last page your question. We've got healthcare, the day you sent it, the status, and we also have a reference number.

> P5: The only thing is missing is the time which I don't really think is necessary.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: And it seemed like, obviously, your focus is like getting that reply from the VA at this point.

> P5: Right.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So let's just say that you read the reply, and you were like, I'm not really following, like, I don't know if this does mean that I can get coverage or not.

> P5: Simmer.

Tyler: You. You wanted to reply back to the Va you won't be able to actually type in this prototype today. So just using words. Can you describe to me what you would do next to send a reply.

> P5: Sure. I would write in the your message section of send a reply.

> P5: If I was confused I might maybe want to attach my letter. That shows my disability rating.

> P5: Just so. You know, they can see what I'm seeing.

> P5: I don't know how to drag and drop, so I would choose from folder, and it just attach my disability. Letter and then hit send.

Tyler: Okay, awesome. That felt pretty straightforward. So we'll pretend like that's what you've done. But you can actually just go ahead and click in that text box, and we'll see some text appear. So we'll pretend, like you type that in okay?

Tyler: And you can go ahead and send that when you're ready.

Tyler: And I'll give you a minute to just read through this page, too.

> P5: So it essentially says it restarts the 7 day clock, and that if they need more information they'll reach out.

Tyler: okay, so we've sent them this reply.

Tyler: And they're gonna take 7 business days to rep to respond back to you, when we think about those like 3 boxes that were on that homepage before. Is this gonna create a new box.

> P5: This should be in my mind, it would fall under, reopened because they had classified it as solved. But I want it. I sent a reply to reopen it, because I have continued questions about it.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: that makes sense. So it'll be like within that same conversation that we were just looking at.

> P5: Yeah.

Tyler: okay.

Tyler: cool.

Tyler: And you talked about the reopened status.

Tyler: does that feel that feels pretty intuitive that it goes from solved and then now it's reopened. Because, you replied, what would happen after that?

> P5: It should go back to in progress once they read it, and they're working on a reply, I would think it would just start all over again, and then why it should be listed as solved again.

Tyler: Yeah. that makes sense.

Tyler: And if we wanted to get back to that homepage that we're talking about, can you show me how we'd get back there.

> P5: Yeah, at the top of the page where it says, or at the bottom. It's not just says at the bottom to return to ask. Va. Has it at the top or the bottom, either one.

Tyler: perfect.

Tyler: Alright. And then we're back at this page. This probably feels familiar now.

Tyler: let's have a look down at the questions and let's just see if anything has changed.

> P5: Yup, it says, reopened.

Tyler: Okay, so that's kind of what you expected.

Tyler: Yeah, is there anything else? We're noticing that that might be different.

> P5: The updated date has changed.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: that's true.

> P5: And it has the little clock as the instead of that was a check mark when it was solved.

Tyler: Right.

Tyler: That makes sense.

Tyler: What order are these questions in now on the page.

> P5: They are still in newest to oldest, even though the original request was earlier, because it was reopened on the this, says the 27th and the one underneath. It was from the 26th, the 27th one would pop to the top because it's the most recent activity.

Tyler: Got it. Okay? So it's not. It might not be the most recent one that you submitted. But it's had the most recent update or activity.

> P5: Yes.

Tyler: Okay, very cool.

Tyler: Do you have anything else you want to share with me about this page that we're looking at.

> P5: I think, for someone using it the 1st time. It might be nice to have like a key with like print. Symbols mean, like the star, the little clock, the check mark.

> P5: like up at the top.

Tyler: and do you feel like those symbols are like kind of unclear.

> P5: The reopened one is unclear, you know. I I get the star and solved with the check mark. But I don't really know what that clock means for reopened.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: yeah. that makes sense. awesome. Okay, well.

### Cool down

Tyler: we can go ahead and stop sharing your screen whenever you're ready and then we? We have a bit of time to just kind of reflect on on what we just did.

Tyler: So I think.

Tyler: yeah, you can still hear me right. I can't see you. Oh, there you are, okay.

Tyler: awesome. So overall, that felt pretty straightforward to watch you kind of like click through and describe things to me. Is that a fair statement that it felt pretty straightforward?

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: and kind of like the main 2 things that you noted that were maybe things worth changing is like the icons that we just talked about, maybe especially the clock one. And then, when we get into those question details, the order of the page felt weird. It felt like the reply should be coming first.st

> P5: Yeah.

Tyler: Yeah, is there anything else that you wanna add to that anything else that we should be thinking about changing?

> P5: I don't think so.

Tyler: If you wanted to tell another veteran about Ask VA about this like tool, how would you describe it to them?

> P5: I would say. It's a great way to ask a question. That's not something urgent, you know you have, you know, 10 to 14 days, and it's just something you're looking into or want information about for the future. It would be a really good resource.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: very cool. So it's that kind of came from right. When you arrived, you noticed that it said, 7 business days. This is not going to be a quick reply.

> P5: Yeah.

Tyler: Awesome. Do you think that this is something that you could see yourself using?

> P5: Yeah, for certain things. I would. Yeah.

Tyler: for things that are like, less urgent.

> P5: Yeah.

Tyler: Right now. It sounded like a lot of the ways you interact with the Va. Is with your healthcare team.

Tyler: would this be something you'd use to talk to your healthcare team or not.

> P5: Probably not. I would probably stick to secure messaging for that.

Tyler: yeah.

Tyler: what would this be more useful for?

> P5: So non healthcare related questions, benefits questions.

> P5: my kids are getting ready to start college. So you know, maybe chapter 35 questions things like that that I don't need to do right away. But then I'm kind of in the planning stages of...

Tyler: so like, more kind of informational and like you said, planning stages, maybe it's not urgent, you're just kind of trying to collect information.

Tyler: Awesome.

Tyler: I think you've answered all my questions. We went really quickly. But you also went through the prototype really quickly.

Tyler: Do you have any questions for me?

> P5: No.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: well, I think that's it.

Tyler: I wanted to say thanks again for sharing this time with us. It's really helpful to get some feedback from you, and we're talking to a bunch of other veterans this week as well. I know it's your 1st time doing this with the VA so I hope that it was a good enough experience that you want to do it again. And if you know other veterans that are interested, the folks who set up this research session. They're gonna send you a thank, you know, and they'll include some information you can share with other veterans so they can get signed up to, and if you have questions you can, you can let them know too.

> P5: All right. Thank you.

Tyler: Awesome. Well, I hope you have a lovely rest of your day, and thanks for joining us.

> P5: You too, bye.

Tyler: Bye.
