### Warm up

Tyler: Awesome. So I just wanna confirm again, are you comfortable? If I record my screen and audio today.

> P7: Yes.

Tyler: Okay, perfect. So that was a lot of information in a couple of minutes. Do you have questions for me at this point?

> P7: No.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: Awesome. Well, let's get started before we start looking at a prototype. I want to learn just a little bit more about your background and your experience with the VA. How long have you been a Veteran?

> P7: I joined the the military in 2007, got out in 2013.

> P7: So since since then.

Tyler: Okay. And did you start interacting with the VA right after you got out of service in 2013?

> P7: I didn't start till 2015. My 1st interactions with the VA.

Tyler: Do you remember how you 1st got in touch with the VA?

> P7: I did a Google search. Basically. Yes.

> P7: And then I got some info from from old colleagues and then, like they basically went to the big VA hospital here in my town, my city.

> P7: Yeah, it wasn't good experience at 1st in 2015. At all.

Tyler: So it wasn't a good experience going in?

> P7: Oh, yeah, everything was just very confusing. Like all their website, they they have. I don't know, like 5 different websites, and they're all do some different stuff and kinda hard to really find information online.

> P7: And then when I 1st went to the hospital, it was really really hard, just finding where to go, ask for like what department, and go check out just to get signed up when I did get when I did find where to go get signed up. The lady was very very rushy, very rude. Kind of seem like she wanted to go to learns telling me I didn't I qualify for va disability when I actually am a Iraq War veteran? So I was at a corrector. I was like, pretty sure, have you? What you've gone to Iraq. You qualify for some Va benefits. She was just like kind of dismissing me, and so just even signing up, for the view was just a headache.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: Yeah, that sounds really. That sounds like, not a good experience.

> P7: Not at all. Yeah. So yeah, kind of turned me off. And I did go to try to file for disability benefits. And that was just very confusing. Also it was just 2015. They just gave me, like a stack of paperwork to fill out, and you know, with a whole bunch of information that they wanted, that I did not, you know, have records, for did not remember so I never got that done.

> P7: I did end up going to try to seek some therapy, for, some depression. They ended up signing me up for a psychiatrist, which back then I did not know the difference, and that that guy, the psychiatrist, is very rude, kinda just assuming that I was there for to get some prescription meds and and I had it correct. I was like, I'm not here for any minutes, he's like, well, why did come see me? I was like I didn't sign up to see you. They I asked for a therapist. They send me to you. I was very irate at the VA. And after that I never really went back to the VA. Till, like maybe I would say 2019.

> P7: It took me like 4 years, 5 years to go back to actually file for disability. And that's after, you know, I found out that my colleagues were that kind of pushing me towards it because... I'm a realtor, so I can reconnect it with some people, and they kind of told me what you know. They started getting some disability, so made some of them push me to go back to the VA. So I finally started doing it back in like 2018 2019, I think.

> P7: And finally, yeah, and that was. yeah, brief. You know, history of my Va experience.

Tyler: Yeah, thanks for sharing that with me. That sounds tough, and I think it's a common experience for Veterans to almost like need to step away from the VA when they've, like you said you had like 4 or 5 years in between that 1st interaction. Because obviously, it's a lot of work. And emotional as well to have to like describe your disability or how you've been impacted. So, I'm glad that you are hopefully you know, able to receive care and things like that from the VA now. But I'm sorry it's not simpler.

> P7: Yeah, no, it's okay. It's all good.

Tyler: When you contact the VA these days, do you usually like go into the VA, or do you ever call on the phone or go online?

> P7: I usually try to call on the phone. Just find it a little simple. I do have some numbers saved on my phone contacts. So I just kinda just mark. And I just hope the operator kinda relays me to the right you know department.

> P7: That's that's usually my go to.

Tyler: Are you usually calling the medical center like things to do with healthcare?

> P7: Yeah, yeah.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. Have you ever used something called my healthy vet?

> P7: Yes, I have used my healthevet before. Remind me. Which one? What's the purpose of that website?

Tyler: Yeah, yeah, there's a lot of different websites. My healthyevet's  focused on healthcare.

Tyler: And I guess I'm asking, because I'm curious if you've ever messaged your doctor online?

> P7: No, I have not used it for that. I've used it for trying to find my records.

Tyler: Okay. Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: Have you ever heard of something called Ask VA?

> P7: Ask VA. I have heard of that one. I don't. I don't think I've used it.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: well, that's not a problem. I'm gonna actually show you ask Va, because that's something we're gonna be talking about today. It's not a problem if you haven't heard of it, or used it, or or anything like that. But I'll share my screen really quick. Just so you can see what Ask VA looks like.

Tyler: so this is a tool that veterans and other folks can use to contact the Va online. You can ask questions about like healthcare or housing assistance. A bunch of different topics. So it's essentially like a an online contact form that you've you've probably seen one of those on another website before. Right.

> P7: Yes, yes.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: And we're gonna pretend like for this session. We're gonna pretend like you're familiar with. Ask Va, so we're gonna say, like you've used ask VA. And a couple of times in the past to ask questions.

Tyler: at this point. Do you have any questions about ask Va or this scenario that we're gonna be in today.

> P7: No.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: I'll go ahead and stop sharing my screen. So it's just like a basic idea of of kind of what we're thinking about. You've submitted some questions to the Va

Tyler: and now we're gonna shift gears a little bit. I'm gonna send something for you to open on your screen and I'm gonna send that in. Are you on your computer on your phone?

> P7: My computer.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: I'm going to send a link in the Zoom chat.

Tyler: and then, if you can just open that for me and and let me know once it's loaded.

> P7: It's loading.

Tyler: Okay.

> P7: Still loading.

> P7: Okay, it's up.

Tyler: Okay, awesome. So now we're gonna share your screen on. Zoom, have you done that recently?

> P7: Yes, I've done it before.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So I'll give you a minute to just share your screen.

> P7: Share desktop.

Tyler: Let me know if you need a hand.

> P7: Saying, I have to quit zoom to share.

Tyler: Okay.

> P7: Like to record this computer screen.

Tyler: Yeah, sometimes, if you haven't given zoom permission, you'll have to give it permission. So we have 2 options. One is we can do that if you feel like you want to go change your settings.

Tyler: The other option is, I can share my screen, but you won't be able to click, I'll have to click for you. Do you have a preference?

> P7: I think that'd probably be easier.

Tyler: Let's do that. I'll open it up on my screen.

Tyler: Alright. So I'm gonna share my screen. Now. Can you see that on your side?

> P7: Yes.

Tyler: Okay, perfect. So since I'm sharing my screen now, you're gonna have to say things like, Okay, can you please scroll down? Because obviously, I won't know when you when you want to do something. But otherwise this will work perfectly fine. Okay.

### Dashboard

Tyler: Awesome. So we're looking at the screen, and we can see that we're on Ask Va. And we're pretending like you're signed in. So it says Jordan. Up here in the top right corner. We're gonna pretend like that says your name. And this is your account. Okay?

Tyler: So 1st off, and you can let me know when you want me to scroll I'd love for you to just take a look around and describe what you're noticing on this page.

> P7: The 1st intent was to try to find out what this page is for. So I see Ask Va. On the top, and then get answers to your questions about VA benefits and services.

> P7: And then ask a new question. I guess that's the 1st thing I looked at.

Tyler: awesome. So like, 1st thing, you're trying to do you said is figure out what this page is about which.

> P7: Yeah.

Tyler: Was kind of up at the talk. That makes sense. And then you saw this link for asking a new question.

Tyler: yeah, that's helpful.

> P7: And like, for now I guess I'd just be curious on what that link does.

> P7: And then also, let's call my attention as these 2 boxes on the bottom. Sign in and technical issues. And do my dependents get healthcare?

> P7: Yeah, I'm just a little confused on these boxes, you know.

Tyler: Yeah, no, that's that's helpful.

> P7: Last updated, status.

> P7: Yeah. So everything below. I guess, starting from your questions and below is kinda just confusing. Like is this just general, does it have to do with me?

Tyler: Makes sense.

> P7: Sign in and technical issue. May 26. How do I access messaging on the VA website. I'd like to send a secure message. Status, new. Last updated.

> P7: Yes, I don't know really what that sign in and technical issues is.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. So the beginning of the page felt clear. You kind of understood what this is about, and then everything kind of down below is a little more confusing. So I'm gonna give a little bit of context.

Tyler: We're gonna pretend, like you've asked the VA a couple of questions in the past.

> P7: Okay.

Tyler: So these would be the questions you've asked.

Tyler: So knowing that, does that feel more straightforward? Or is it still a little bit confusing what these boxes are?

> P7: Yeah, if if I'm the one who typed that question as, how do I access secure messaging  on the Va website, customer and all that. Then, I would probably remember that that I wrote it like that verbatim.

Tyler: Right.

> P7: You know, and then status new, last updated. And then check details. I guess I would click that to see if they answer my question correct.

> P7: And then I guess I would have asked I'm 70% disabled, do my dependents get healthcare as well? Thanks. On May 21st 2024.

> P7: And then I guess solved means they answered my question, so I guess I would have already checked that. Can you click on Check details?

Tyler: I'm gonna hold off one moment before we do that, but we will get there. But that was really helpful. Just like watching you walk through everything. So a notice you're noticing like, if you had typed these questions yourself, it would feel more familiar. And you that probably wouldn't. You wouldn't have had to like be confused. Which makes sense.

Tyler: And then you talked a little bit through, like some of the information like you said you submitted this question on May 21.st you talked about how it's solved. So that probably means that there's a reply.

Tyler: That's really helpful. What does it mean where it says, like sign in and technical issues, healthcare. What's that mean?

> P7: I guess they're either... Either I clicked on category like the category of a question, or they categorized it for me.

Tyler: And then if you know, we're in your account. And we're looking at your questions, why is it helpful for you to see that category?

> P7: I makes it everything, everything more organized and gives me more, just clarity on what I'm trying to ask.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: And I'm seeing a couple of different dates, so we mentioned may 21st you think that's probably the day it was submitted. And then we've got a last updated date. What is that referring to?

> P7: [Last updated is] probably referring to either when they asked my question or they answered my question, or maybe I don't know if you're able to go in there and edit it.

Tyler: Hmm.

> P7: Off of off the top, I would assume. That's when they either tried to reply, give me a reply, or answer my question.

Tyler: Yeah. And then looking at this, page, there's 3 questions that you've submitted on this page which ones of them, do you think, have a reply from the VA?

> P7: I think so. Maybe new. I'm not sure that means if it's a new question by me, or if they've got a new reply from them, and you reply back from them.

> P7: So I'm not quite sure with new. Because, I guess, I'm assuming the top May 26th is, when I created the the question. Unless it hasn't. I guess it's just been updated. I'm not sure if that update time is after this the same day.

> P7: So I don't know if new means, if that's a new question that I created, or if that means I've got a new reply from back from the VA.

> P7: So obviously solved, I would assume it's been and we've been chatting back and forth. They've been answering my questions and then.

> P7: If I've decided to close it out, and you know it's been, say that it's been solved. My questions been answered right.

Tyler: Right.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So that's really helpful. New is kind of confusing. It's not really clear if it's like a new reply, or you just submitted it and then solved you're thinking it means like we've had a back and forth conversation, and we reached a conclusion.

> P7: Resolved. Yeah, exactly.

Tyler: Okay. And you said, resolved just now.

> P7: Basically, I feel like, you know, it's done, and it's done with.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: Is there a difference between the words like solved and resolved?

> P7: Not really.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: What about solved vs. closed? Does that have any difference?

> P7: Yeah closed I guess it's more clear like it's been done. It's done with.

Tyler: And who do you think decides when something's solved?

> P7: I would hope it's me. But just seeing solved, I can't really tell if it's me or the VA saying it's done.

Tyler: yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: I'm kind of curious. Let's say that like you, you knew that you asked the VA a long time ago about home loans. But you couldn't remember what they told you. So you signed back in today because you wanted to read their response. So you were back here on this page, and I know you don't have a lot of questions here yet.

Tyler: But let's say there was a couple of more questions. So you're looking through a bunch of questions. You're trying to find this question about home loans.

Tyler: How would you find that? What would you do first?

> P7: So if I wanted to review my question, I would go on here. And then, obviously, I see housing assistance and home loans, so if I had many questions I would look for, or I guess, a small amount, a handful of questions. Maybe I would just look for the housing assistance and home loans highlighted right there. The category, and then see if that's the question I'm looking for.

> P7: If I have many questions, I guess I would just go to, you know I would, for some reason there's no filters up in the top to filter for the category. Guess I wouldn't be... I would be annoying that there's no filter [by category]. So I would try to filter by if I knew it was solved or not by status. Last updated, I don't think I would use that to find it. So I guess I would just be annoyed that there's no filter for categories, and then like, what's the purpose of having the category on there if I can't search using the categories. If I had many to scroll through.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P7: If it's just 3 like this, this is fine. But if there's many, then yeah.

Tyler: Yeah, I love that description that was really helpful. So it sounds like that category like that. Keyword would be your preference for for how to like find things. And so you noticed that that's not an option up here. It's just last updated, or status. And what if you had like, let's say, like all of your questions were in the same category like you only asked questions about healthcare.

Tyler: What do you think you would be looking for in that case? What piece of information would help you find questions?

> P7: So it was all healthcare. And then, yeah, be scrolling, trying to find the question. I guess I would. I would probably use the newest to oldest, or, you know, last updated or oldest to newest. Hopefully. And then I would just still be scrolling. Then I guess I would try to do a status thing to filter, or to narrow it down a little bit. New, in progress, reopened.

> P7: And I would just be also be hoping like, just like you. If you do on online banking, you can look at your transactions and just put like a keyword, and I'll kind of like, narrow it down that way.

> P7: I'd just be kinda annoyed again and be wondering why the VA gets all this money, and I can't put us just simple keyword search on their websites. I guess I would be annoyed if I had a many questions on all in the same category, and I'd have to scroll.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: that makes sense. I can see how that would be annoying. And it would probably take a while to kind of look around. And it sounds like what you've identified is, it's missing a way for you to just search some keywords so like. If it was, all your questions are about healthcare, then can I look for that question about my dependents, or whatever.

> P7: Yeah, exactly.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: Yeah. So  while we have this open, we've got this status menu opened.

Tyler: and we can see a couple of statuses in here we already talked about new, and then we talked about solved. But it looks like we've got in progress and reopened. What do you think those statuses mean?

> P7: I guess so, if I just clicked on the status.

> P7: I would guess new would be like me having created a new question and in progress would be them finally replying, the 1st reply back, and we're still chatting back and forth. And then solved would be hopefully, any numbers of resolution to the question. Reopened, maybe I want to go back to that question. Add more that I want to ask them about it.

> P7: [Reopened.] I guess my 1st impression would be, okay, I'm able to go back to a solved question and somehow reopen it, and ask them again more about it.

Tyler: yeah.

Tyler: That makes sense to me. The way you described all of those.

Tyler: Okay, let's go ahead and come back to something you asked earlier, on which was, Can we click on check details? So let's go ahead and check details for this question that you asked on May 21st.

### Check details

Tyler: I'm going to give you like a little bit of a scenario to think about.

Tyler: We're here reading this question, thinking, Oh, this was just solved.

Tyler: So you're wanting to know what the VA told you, what their reply back was. Okay? And then let me know what you want me to do when we get to this new page.

> P7: So I see that's your question. That's a question I asked, details. Okay, healthcare. Sent May 21st, status solved. Send a reply message. So yeah, I'm just confused. What exactly was solved. I don't see any answer to the question. Where's the answer to the question? How is this even solved?

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: yeah. So immediately, like, yes, we see it solved. But we're like, why.

> P7: Yeah.

Tyler: Do you want me to scroll down anyone.

> P7: Yes.

Tyler: I'll scroll down a little bit.

> P7: Okay, replies and conversation. Okay, the conversations right there?

Tyler: So that felt a little bit lost. Right?

> P7: Yeah, yeah, I'd be looking. And then maybe I finally tried to set a scroll. I guess.

> P7: So, response from VA, okay, that's good. I know this is what the VA wrote, not something I wrote.

> P7: I guess I go up from there and scroll back. Can you scroll up again?

> P7: So I guess I'm assuming it's just they want to put the older questions or the older chats in the bottom and the newers on top right? That way you don't scroll all the way to look at the newest chats. That's why they have the reply stuff before that I can read the chat. I believe.

> P7: Yeah, if I'm just gonna go and review an old question like, I guess I would prefer the not scrolling. It's like, why do I need the reply box first? Like, it's been solved.

Tyler: Totally so. It felt like it wasn't meeting your expectations like you're here to look for your reply.

Tyler: Yeah. And then. Now, it's not in that order.

Tyler: let's go ahead and look a little bit more, closely at their reply, so the question was that you know in this case your 70 disability rating, and you want to see if your dependents can get healthcare coverage also.

Tyler: So I think you've skimmed this reply. But tell me what you're thinking. You can read it more closely. But tell me afterwards what you're thinking about the Va's response.

> P7: Okay. Hello. You have reached a VA app exclusively for family members of service members or Veterans who are determined service connected to the same... so they are being paid... [skimming aloud]. But I don't know. What does that look... Can can I go back up to the question again?

Tyler: Yeah.

> P7: So I asked, I'm 70%, do my dependents get healthcare as well? Thanks. And then I'll scroll down and you have CHAMPVA, yeah, I don't know what CHAMPVA is. I guess I went to ask VA for this question, so I don't know what CHAMPVA is, and why do I care?

> P7: [Skimming aloud]. Our program is exclusively for family members of service members. Such veterans who are determined, permanent in totallly service, connected, disabled, or who's ready, and surely are 100% or the service connected who are not... care coverage for Veterans.

> P7: Yeah, that is very confusing, like a whole paragraph, or like a run on sentence. It's just one. You know. 'Our program is exclusively for family members of service members, slash veterans, full time members of service members sash who are determined permanently and totally service connected, disabled. Whose range show they are being paid...'

> P7: I would prefer like maybe a colon, and then bullet points on who is eligible instead of this whole big old sentence with commas. And I'm just like.

> P7: You know, cause ago, sometimes you read a comma, and you know they're just listing stuff. Or it's like just maybe more info on whatever they're talking about.

> P7: So it's just lots of reading. Trying to decipher what they're trying to say.

> P7: [Skimming aloud]... who died service connected or not. Otherwise TriCare. And then I guess we do not provide care, slash coverage for veterans. I'm confused on that, too. Could you navigate for your local VAMC for assistance...

> P7: So the their whole answer is just very confusing. It's not like a yes or no. I guess they're giving me kinda like who is eligible. But they're doing it in like  big old long sentences instead of just kinda like listing it, like a simpler way to write it out.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P7: So I'm trying to decipher what they're saying.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P7: And then in the end, like I don't feel like my question was answered, and then, just like we'll reach out to your VAMC for assistance. So right, you must go to. Yeah. Complete the submit to address for fax. What am I applying to? To apply? Not sure what to apply... What they're talking about.

> P7: My 1st thought is, I wouldn't read the rest of the question like, what are you they trying to say I'm applying to, and then I would kind of go back to the rest. What are they? What they talking to about? What are they talking about? Apply to what? What do they? What do I need apply to? What do they think I need apply to?

> P7: It's a very confusing answer, yeah.

Tyler: I think the number of times that you've had to reread it is kind of is pretty telling, like it's not clear upfront on what they're saying.

Tyler: And like you said, it's not necessarily answering your question. It's kind of like explaining, maybe their program.

Tyler: So that's that's quite confusing. And you talked about ways that like this text could be broken up. So if they do want to explain, okay, here's who's eligible. Then maybe bullet points would make it easier to read and.

> P7: Yeah.

> P7: And I would like.

Tyler: With the form.

Tyler: yeah, go ahead. What do you think you...?

> P7: I would like a separation between like the answer part near the 1st paragraph, and then the rest was like. More like, if you need more help, I would maybe like, separated by a subtitle like 'for more help or more info visit these links.' Instead of me reading them and it kinda just feels like, oh, for more info, for more help go to this. Separated from my answer.

Tyler: Right, yeah. So it's not just a block of text.

> P7: Yeah, exactly.

> P7: When I first clicked on this, more details about this question, and then you scroll down the conversation, and I just saw that big old block I'm just like, oh my god. It's just yeah, I see a whole bunch of links in there and numbers.

Tyler: For sure. I think that makes a lot of sense like it. It's not as maybe personal as it could be in terms of replying to you, and then maybe, if they want to give you extra information, you talked about like breaking that into a new section. I think that that all makes sense.

Tyler: let's say you were reading this. And you were like, Okay, I'm still confused, like, I don't really understand. If that means that they're eligible or they're not eligible. So we talked a little bit about this. But there's this option to send the VA a reply.

Tyler: If you were gonna send a reply to the Va. Like right now, this question says it's solved. Do you think you're able to send a reply to the VA?

> P7: Send a reply. It says solved. And then...

> P7: Since the chat box is there for me to send a reply, I would assume they're allowing me to send a reply, and then I would send it and hope. Not knowing if they're gonna reply, cause it says solved.

> P7: So I would just I would just try to send the reply, and then just check back later, and then let's see if it worked.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: that makes sense. Kinda hope for the best. But maybe expect expect the worst. Okay, so let's say you were, gonna do that. So you're gonna type in your message here, we can't actually type in this today. But I'm just gonna click in this box. We're gonna pretend, like you typed out a reply.

Tyler: So now we're seeing your reply here.

Tyler: and if you wanted to send this to the VA can you tell me where you want me to click?

> P7: Okay, I would press Send. The blue button.

Tyler: Okay, I'll go ahead and click, send, and then I'll give you a minute to read this page.

> P7: Your response should be seen within 7 days, if we need more information we'll contact you. Okay, kind of straightforward, like my response was sent. And I should receive a reply within 7 business days.

> P7: I was gonna wonder why it takes so long. But okay.

> P7: Well, I'm just gonna go to Google and research the question myself. Cause 7 business days, like, Okay. Then, I'll just, you know, hopefully find the answer myself. I'll take maybe 15-30 min, but hopefully I'll find my answer myself rather than waiting that long.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: yeah. So kind of maybe weren't expecting it to take as long as it is, it's saying that it will. And how like, how are they gonna get back in touch with you after those 7 business days? Is that clear.

> P7: I'm thinking they're just gonna reply on here. I'm gonna have to log in to Ask VA. And and like check to see if they've answered the question. I think it would be nice if they would notify me through email that I got a response to my question or something, you know, or something like that. Instead of me having to go back log in.

> P7: Because it says they're gonna reply within 7 days. But I don't know if they're gonna notify me that they replied, and which makes me think I'm gonna have to check every day to see when my reply has been sent.

Tyler: Yeah, that's a great point, like you might know where to find your reply, because you've used this tool, but you wouldn't know necessarily when to check back.

> P7: Yeah.
> 
> P7: Do I have to check every day? Do you have to check every, twice a day, you know.

Tyler: for sure. Is there any other information that's missing from this page?

> P7: Not that I can think of.

Tyler: So how would you get back to the Ask VA homepage, where we started? From here?

> P7: Oh.

> P7: I guess since it was a solved question, I'm still unsure if this is gonna really get to anyone, so maybe I would like it to say, like, your question was reopened or something. A way to verify, to reassure me, like, okay, we know it was solved. And you just reopened it instead of like, is it really gonna get to anyone?

Tyler: Yeah.

> P7: So yeah, I'm not sure, like. Just like we were unsure from before from the page prior this response, and I'm still not sure.

Tyler: Yeah, so especially because it's already been solved. You need a little bit of reassurance. Yeah.

> P7: Yeah, exactly. So. What I would do next is I would go back to that one page where it says, new reopened or solve, and I would check to see did it change that the status change, you know. Maybe like that's what I guess. What is missing is a status change on there.

Tyler: yeah, let's go back and do that. How would we get there.

> P7: Yeah, so I would click on the benefits and healthcare... No. So, my 1st instict to go up to the tabs. But none of this helps, so then this home, contact us, ask questions and I would look at that. I don't want ask a question, Ask VA. I guess I would go to home. On that [breadcrumb] link right there.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P7: The arrow.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: yeah, up at the top. Here, I see that that makes sense.

Tyler: we're actually gonna click on Ask VA [different level of breadcrumb]. Which is this one here. And I'm curious like, what made you feel like we shouldn't click on. Ask Va. And instead, we should click on home?

Tyler: If you can describe that.

> P7: Oh, it just feels like it's gonna take me back to the page I was before this one. Because I kind of feel like question sent is where I'm at right now, it would be the last page I was on. That's what it that that makes me feel like.

Tyler: Right. I totally see that that makes sense.

Tyler: Okay, well, let's click.

Tyler: Oh, go ahead.

> P7: I'm not sure what contact us was.

Tyler: But that makes sense. You're going like one step back.

> P7: Yeah.

Tyler: Thinking, okay, that's not. That's not the one I want, and it's not contact us. So I guess home.

> P7: Yes.

Tyler: Yeah, cool. Okay well let's click Ask VA. And then let's go ahead and have a look around like you said.

> P7: Okay. Now I see that my question was reopened. So okay, so I'm like good. It was reopened. So that gives you more reassurance that they're gonna respond to give me a response back.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: that makes sense. So that totally met your kind of like your hope, which was that it would be reopened. Why has the order of the questions shifted?

> P7: Just shifted to be from, I guess last, whatever was updated

Tyler: that makes sense.

Tyler: we've kind of reached the end of my questions, about these screens is there, anything else you want to share with me while we're still looking at this.

> P7: No, not not off the top of my head.

### Cool down

Tyler: Well, we've got a couple of minutes left, so I'll stop sharing my screen.

Tyler: And we can just spend the last couple of minutes kind of like reflecting on what we just did.

Tyler: so overall. What do you think of that process?

> P7: So as soon as I've asked my 1st question, and I see it takes 7 days to to answer my questions like, this is not very useful. I'm better off doing Google search for an hour by myself.

> P7: And then if I finally that that asked VA, that would be my last resource. I would phone a friend, you know. I'd probably dial the VA and try to get an operator, maybe to answer my questions. It would be, 7 days way too long, like, why bother. And knowing I have to log into the VA, just the process of logging in, and how long that takes.

> P7: ...With them, constantly asking me to change my create a new password. You know what I mean, for for first password so long that I have it written on my notes somewhere. I have to open up my notes, copy and paste my password, hope, hope that they're not asking me to create a new password because it's been, I don't know. Like 2 days since my last password user, any of my Google Google authentication go on there, put my Google authentication because I just and then and then they're gonna like, and then they're gonna ask me to put my text PIN authentication. After that  I did all that. Just ask it quite, you know, just.

> P7: And fumble through the website again. Ask a question. And then wait 7 days. For the transfer back. And then not even not even get a email notification that all your answer question was answered. So, I have to do that process all over again, just to check to see if they answer my question. I'm not gonna do all that.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: yeah, that does. When you describe it. It does sound pretty long winded. Do you feel like you didn't really know how long it was gonna take like that. It would be like 7 business days until we got to that that kind of last screen.

> P7: No, I didn't. No, I thought it was gonna be more I was hoping maybe, someone sitting on the other end like ready to answer the question. Maybe, take 5 min to answer it, or hopefully, maybe even like AI. Now with, you know, with all chat Gpt how that answers your question. You go on Google now, it's AI, you know. It's just way faster to ask Google at this point, or even chat gpt.

> P7: Or you know if I wasn't I was less technically savvy I'd just call the VA number. And hopefully they answer my question for me.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: Yeah. So your expectation was like that. You might get either an immediate response or like a couple of minutes later. But but more like, you know, in that session you would have a reply, which is not the case. Yeah. And it sounds like you'd even prefer, let's say, a less personal response like you might Google or use Chat Gbt, or whatever. If it means, you can get your reply sooner right.

> P7: Correct.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: that totally makes sense.

Tyler: is there anything about the process that you liked like anything you'd want to keep? Or you thought was working.

> P7: I like that once I knew what the boxes were. I like that.

> P7: not sure what it would look like if...

> P7: Well, I guess when I would 1st log in, and then there'd be no questions answer or boxes, questions asked or boxes, so I would click on, ask a question. I would ask it. Then go back to the home screen. I would see that, I would assume I see the box pop up with my question.

> P7: So I like that that it says, you know the category. And then the question verbatim, how I asked it on there and then, you know. I think the status we covered that that was a little confusing.

> P7: I would assume you meant that. I just asked. You know that I just asked the question, so I would see that.

> P7: And so I like the the questions were there for me to revisit, and that there were on the homepage as well that, you know. And I have to search for the questions I had had asked. I like that part.

Tyler: Yeah. So are you liking like that it's kind of it's easy to find a question?

> P7: Exactly. Easy to find them. I don't have to click another link to open another page to see my questions that I have asked.

> P7: Already right on the main screen. So like, ask a new question or revisit the old ones. Like that's that's what I'm there for.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. And it, you also called out, how you like that it has your question, verbatim easy for you to to read and help you kind of find old questions. Yeah.

> P7: Yeah.

Tyler: Awesome.

Tyler: That makes sense. I think you've answered all my questions that was really really helpful. I do want to leave a little bit of time in case you have any questions for me.

> P7: No.

Tyler: No? Okay.

Tyler: Well, I know it's your. This is your 1st time taking part in research at the Va we really really appreciate your feedback. We've got loads of notes that we're gonna go back through and

Tyler: I know we've learned a lot in in the hour with you. So I appreciate it. The next step is the folks who set up this research session from Paragien they're gonna send you an email. And it's gonna have a thank you. Note and information, you could pass on to other veterans in case they want to to do this in the future.

Tyler: but yeah, and if you have questions you can reach out to them. I think that's everything else for me, though.

> P7: Okay.

Tyler: Awesome. Well, thanks so much for your time.

> P7: Okay, thank you, yeah.

Tyler: Have a good day.

> P7: Thanks guys. Bye.

Tyler: Bye, thanks.
