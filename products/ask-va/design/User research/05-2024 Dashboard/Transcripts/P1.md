### Warm up

Tyler: The recording has started. I just wanna confirm that it's okay. If I record my screen and audio today?

> P1: I am fully aware, and authorized to record it. So that's good.

Tyler: Okay, awesome.

Tyler: Do you have any questions for me at this point?

> P1: I'm gonna go get my hat.

Tyler: Yeah, of course.

> P1: Alright. I could still talk and answer, so you can keep going. It's Bluetooth so.

Tyler: Okay, yeah. So the 1st couple of questions are, just kind of conversation, anyways. So I'm curious how long you've been a Veteran?

> P1: I was injured when I was 18, and I'm 54 right now. So I think almost 40 years, just short of 40 years, so like 37 years.

Tyler: Yeah, okay.

> P1: Give me a second cause it might go out of range.

Tyler: Yeah, okay.

Tyler: You got the hat!

Tyler: Well, now, I can't hear you for some reason.

Tyler: Can you hear me?

Tyler: Okay, I can't hear you. But it looks like you can hear me. Hmm!

Tyler: Must be something with your headphones.

Tyler: I still can't hear you.

Tyler: Maybe your headphones it's kinda weird, because if you can hear me, your headphones are on. Hmm!

> P1: Testing check, check! Can you hear me.

Tyler: Yes, I can hear you now.

> P1: Yeah, there, we go.

Tyler: Awesome.

> P1: Okay, go ahead.

Tyler: All right.

Tyler: I'll let you get settled.

Tyler: So you mentioned that you were injured about 40 years ago. So did you start interacting with the VA right then?

> P1: Immediately.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P1: I did all the paperwork, filed all the claims and everything that you you're told to do within, as soon as I got home.

Tyler: Yeah. And these days, how are you usually contacting the VA?

> P1: In fact, I need to fill out a form again.

> P1: and I can't find the form, but I'm contacting them. I am, as far as like following paperwork, or in regards to my doctors?  Just so I can understand the question.

Tyler: Oh, anything, really? I'm kind of curious about the different ways that you... if you choose to call, or if you choose to email, or if it's different for different reasons.

> P1: It's different for different reasons, and that's the best way to answer it. So if I'm  talking with my main set of doctors that I have, because I have basically a team that I deal with. That team. I know them. They know me. So I have set numbers programmed in my phone.

> P1: And you know I call them, and then just dial directly to the extension the receptionist, and everything. They pretty much know me by voice, you know, and everything. Okay.

> P1: Or I'm going to use secure messaging on the website.

> P1: Or just call and deal with the customer, not customer service...

> P1: You gotta bear with me. That's the [medical condition impacting memory].

> P1: But you know, the main message, and then there, go through and get to the doctors that way.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P1: Or the phone automated type thing.

> P1: Now, as if it's dealing with VA.gov or E benefits. Then I'll use like the website, or if it's really bad, then I have the phone numbers saved in my phone and go that way.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense that's really helpful. So sometimes you're like direct calling your care team sometimes you're using secure messaging sometimes you're going online... That that makes a lot of sense.

Tyler: Have you ever heard of something called Ask VA?

> P1: Yes. When it first came out that thing was terrible.

Tyler: Okay, tell me more about that. Did you ever try and use it?

> P1: Yeah, like, I said when it 1st came out it was terrible, and after trying to use it enough times where it didn't successfully go to where you're asking it. I have not kept up with the current thing because you just got used to just find your own way.

Tyler: Yeah. So a lot of the issues you were having had to do with like, your question wasn't being sent to the right person? Were there other issues?

> P1: Yeah, I was just given inaccurate information or outdated information or not what you're asking the solution for. I was given stuff that was just not going along with what...

> P1: Like, I prefer Waze over Google maps, because Google Maps was 70% accurate and Waze is more like 90% accurate. And before both of them, they called me like the human GPS, because I was like 99% accurate.

> P1: If you get what I'm saying, so why would I go with something that's not even as accurate as my own information?

> P1: Yeah, kind of thing.


Tyler: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense that's frustrating. I can imagine that that happened to you, and probably other people.

Tyler: Well, what we're gonna talk about today is actually Ask Va, so I know you've seen this before and probably used it before. But I just wanna quickly make sure we're on the same page and let you have a look. So this is Ask VA. This is somewhere where we could come and ask a question. It's basically like a contact form.

Tyler: And you can ask about different topics like healthcare or housing assistance.

Tyler: In theory, your question should be sent to the right person. Right and hopefully you'd get a good reply. But we'll talk more about that. And maybe the issues with that throughout our conversation.

Tyler: So for the call, for today, we're gonna say that you have used Ask Va to ask a couple of questions at this point. And I'm gonna stop. Do you have any questions about Ask VA?

> P1: So far. No. Okay.

Tyler: Okay, so I'll stop sharing my screen now. And we're gonna shift gears. So I'm gonna actually send you a link so that you can open something up on your side. It looks like you're on your computer right.

> P1: Yeah, I'm on my laptop.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So I'm gonna send you a link in the zoom chat. So you should have that now. And then if you can open that on your side, let me know when it's loaded for you.

> P1: You are chatting as a guest. Okay, I know that. Duh, right?

> P1: Okay. And then I click.

> P1: I click, you click, we click okay.

> P1: alright. So then, let me see if I can do one of these numbers and put you halfway side... never happens. Okay, let me try that again. Let me take you as zoom and go halfway down, and that didn't work.

Tyler: Well, you know what, we're gonna have you share your screen. And so it actually is gonna probably move.

> P1: Yeah. So let me get the chat back open. Then.

Tyler: Okay.

> P1: no chat. I don't want you separate. It should open on the side, but it didn't. But okay.

> P1: That works. Okay. So now that that happened.

Tyler: So you're back where you can see me. Okay.

> P1: No, it's opening up the Ask Va. But then I can get back to you. No problem.

> P1: Alright. So here's Ask VA. So you want me to see what happened is your chat is opening up, is his own. Pop up and... On the side of the zoom, like it normally does.

Tyler: That's okay.

### Dashboard

> P1: Let's close that down. So you want me to share screen?

Tyler: Yes, please.

> P1: Alright, and I want to be able to share my whole desktop. That'd be the best way to do.

> P1: Okay, do you see it.

Tyler: Yes, it looks like it's loading, yeah, perfect. So I can see Ask Va.

> P1: Yes.

Tyler: Awesome. Okay, so we can see that we're on Ask VA. We're gonna pretend like you've signed in it, says Jordan up in the right hand corner. We'll pretend like it says your name there and you're in your own account. Okay.

Tyler: And so, we're not gonna click on anything yet, but feel free to scroll around and I'd love for you to tell me what you're noticing.

> P1: Scroll, scroll, scroll. Okay? So 1st thing I can scroll. That's number one.

> P1: Well, one, it's in your prototype. So it's gonna be slightly different than what I would normally see. So that's good.

> P1: I am familiar with this look, only because I've seen previous assessment. Prior to that, then this would look foreign to me, but it doesn't. So I'm not like oh, you know, because I I've already seen it. So that being the case, I'm familiar with what's going on right here. And I'm familiar with this plus because I have already seen it.

> P1: Now, this part is kind of different, because you guys are representing what I mean by you guys sometime about you and do the it... different segment of what's hoping comes out soon, coming out soon. So that would need a little bit.

> P1: But this here [header] that's familiar to me. This [accordion] is familiar to me. And the need help in the bottom footer. That's all familiar to me.

> P1: And again, once again. the new look at the top.

> P1: And this whole section all familiar. So basically the juicy middle, not the check details that part familiar with. But you're information. Okay.

> P1: I'm waiting for you to let me know what's going on there.

> P1: Yeah, the format itself. I'm familiar with.

Tyler: Okay. Awesome.

> P1: So I know what the you know how to go through the feature. You know the filter and all of that, because I've already gone through it.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: That's really helpful. And I love the way that you're kind of narrating to me, cause that's helpful for me. That makes sense. So you're seeing some familiarity because you've used va.gov before and you kind of clued in on like some of that the middle bit like you said is maybe the part that might be different. But the structure and the like, the plus and things like that are familiar. That's helpful.

Tyler: So what's in these boxes, these bigger boxes? As we scroll down a little bit.

> P1: So if I'm understanding, I mean.

> P1: I'm looking at. Are you telling me, or you want me to give you my assessment?

Tyler: I'd love for you to give me your assessment.

> P1: Okay. So 1st thing, I'm looking on the right side, and I can see healthcare. And there's where you already gave me the heads up. It's not my actual current rating.

> P1: Okay, that 1 that you guys just threw in there. But that's where it should be, and that's where that will go over... Guess over to the left.

> P1: Once I put sign in, or any of those kind of things. If there it's I don't know what the filter is there. So that's the issue that I'm having.

> P1: I don't know what the question was put in to know what would be like. Other words, what's the input to know what the output would be.

> P1: Here's housing assistance, because this is Ask VA. So we're asking questions. So the answers could be based off of what was asked.

Tyler: Right... Well.

> P1: You know, being that's being the case, like I'm looking at.

> P1: You know how housing assistance and home loans. I'm looking at healthcare, and I'm looking in sign in for technical issues. So the fact that these are the 3 variables that was done I don't have... I have no clue what was asked.

> P1: I'm trying to think what was asked to get these 3 answers.

> P1: Or is this the generic that comes up. Click on Ask VA and these are the 3, like, home categories that just automatically come up like if I went to Google, you know. And there's the 3 things is down at the bottom, or these 3 things. It's just automatically down to bottom... related to that individual when they log in.

Tyler: Yeah, that's a good question.

Tyler: It's feeling to me, like it's not totally clear like, why, these 3 things are here of, like all of the things that could be here potentially.

Tyler: So to set the stage a little bit...

> P1: I mean, I can tell you what I would like or what I would gauge, would be helpful.

Tyler: Yeah, yeah.

> P1: And then, like other words, I don't care what the A to C or D is. I can just tell you from my point, looking at this, what would be cool...

> P1: going just straight from A to B, you know. Call it day. Then you can just fill in the gaps like right here. Healthcare straight up, healthcare. Give me the current status of...

> P1: What I am at without me having to have to go looking for it. So my current disability rating. Is this, do I have any dependence? Is already there. I'm having currently an issue. Getting my wife and my son added to my healthcare. We're having that right now.

> P1: That's real life. And why is that? And they've already been added as my dependents for the last like I don't know. 15 years. Why aren't they already put into the system, and already able to be able to utilize my 90 percent rating. And we have no idea which way to go we've been. Anyway. I don't want a sidebar.

Tyler: Yeah, but that's okay. Cause I think what you're noting is like, this is people asking real questions about their real lives. And it's, yeah, stressful.

> P1: You know that should be right there.

> P1: If I have anything that's going on with the website, if I have any cause, there are some major concerns that people are having. Sometimes your name falls out of the system you can't log in. You're having issues with your. I've gone through this. I've had to guide other people on how to deal with that where you literally slip out the system.

> P1: And you have to keep calling over and over and over again the same 800 numbers that get you the customer service, and then you gotta escalate this any other. I'm thinking that's what's going on right here with just sign in issues. Do you have a claim that's in? Do you have anything that's going on any of those kind of things. Here's your status on. Do you have one? Things of that nature? Okay. Great. That could be what's going on there? Down here at the bottom.

> P1: And do you have anything that's in it? Do you have a loan that's in? Do you wanna file a loan? Do you need home and housing assistance. Okay, I'm thinking, that's what that could be, what's going on there.

> P1: But the thing is, if these are things, it's just gonna automatically be there, why such big boxes? Because if I don't want these things, there. I don't want these things barely put in my face.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P1: And ask you for that. Things that came up with the other folks you're giving me information, and you let me know that you got that information and you throwing it in my face. There's a lot of veterans that are kinda not happy about that. They want to know that you have the means to get to it. But don't tell me that you already got it and throw it in my face.

Tyler: Yeah, okay, that makes sense. So I think what I'm hearing is like, you're seeing this as maybe 3 frequently asked questions from the VA's perspective. And you're like, what if these aren't the questions that I actually need answers to, this is frustrating.

Tyler: So I do wanna give a little bit more context here now. And this is part of what's sometimes confusing about research sessions is, like, this isn't something that you have actually done. You haven't actually submitted questions to the VA through this application that I'm showing you. But we're gonna pretend like these are questions that you've asked the VA. Through Ask VA.

Tyler: Does that make more sense?

> P1: Yeah. Let, okay.

Tyler: So let's say you went into Ask VA and...

> P1: This is here, spot on.

> P1: Why isn't this on my home when I log in on?

> P1: It's still gonna lead me to my home page like, you know I can go right now on my phone and log in to my, you know, my overall login and and it's gonna go to our homepage. But why isn't it connected to my homepage?

> P1: And then there's an Ask VA part of that.

> P1: And then that, as I can ask all the you know questions, and this than the other. Once I ask those questions.

> P1: Why isn't this there in my home page?

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. So like, you're thinking about the way that you have other things in your homepage that are related to a case, say you've submitted, or a claim you've submitted. And this should also be there like, I've asked the VA this question. This should be part of my home page.

Tyler: Is that how you're thinking about it?

> P1: Yeah, I mean, that's the way you look at these big old boxes, right? It seems like the big boxes should be there.

> P1: Not here.

Tyler: Yeah, I totally get that. That makes sense.

Tyler: We've talked a lot about like, kind of the overall, like, what's the purpose of this? What are these questions? Why are they here instead of somewhere else?

Tyler: I want to get a little bit like specific now. So if we look at like one of these questions, let's look at this 1st one here. On the left hand side.

Tyler: I wanna just go through the information here and I want you to tell me what you're noticing. Like, what is May 26th, for example, what do we think that that might be?

> P1: It could be when it was submitted. Or it could be when it was 1st submitted, and then it was last updated. And there's the timestamp.

Tyler: Okay.

> P1: Submitted, and then it was answered. Same day.

> P1: But don't know until you click details.

Tyler: Okay. So you can guess, but really waiting to to learn more on the Check details.

> P1: Yeah, but. If you just look at the one to the side, you know you got 2 different time. You got 2 different, you know, dates on it. You got first and then you got May 25th

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: So, we talked a little bit about this, but there's some labels here. It says, sign in and technical issues. Then it says, healthcare. What are those?

> P1: Categories of what they went to customer service, or whatever they went, or up at the top, under ask, or whatever it's going to have the category.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: And we've got some text underneath that that bigger date... what's that text?

> P1: Could be what the person typed in.

Tyler: Okay, yeah.

Tyler: So the question that they they're asking, or the thing they're submitting to the VA...

Tyler: That makes sense. And then what about the status we've got like status new. And then we've got status solved. What's that about?

> P1: Self-explanatory.

Tyler: Okay. Can you explain it to me?

> P1: It's new. It's just been filed. Somebody's gotta start it...

> P1: Because that's your in your status field. There's your icon to go with that cause. These are like icon checkpoints right new database.

> P1: So you probably have like 5 or 6 of those [statuses]. So, new, solved, under review, or something like that. Ways for a person to kind of know, where's that in the queue.

> P1: And then, you know, here's the update. So they have again an endpoint and outpoint.

> P1: And it's, you know, something works...

> P1: timestamped date stamps. So these are all things that you know. The system can do it on a not an automatic, but a semi automatic basis.

> P1: So it's less mess and fuss.

> P1: They could still call in talk to somebody. But this is all things where it's easy for it to be done, and on an I's and O's, so to speak. So it's easy for it to flow. So now if they wanna download things, for instance, if it gets to the point where, if you have a a ability to download some of your criteria, you want to keep these things kind of singularly so that, for if they, if you guys allow for them to download it, they can.

> P1: If they wanna cross it over into another platform or something like that, I'm pretty sure you guys have it where you can control this. So you probably have a word. I don't know if you're going to be using it with.

> P1: Using my thought. I have it here. I mean I have it here. I can't get it here, but you know there's like Mailchimp, and there's all these other type of softwares that kind of interact with each other.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P1: And so, in order for that to work behind the scenes, you gotta kind of be able to have different fields and different ways for it to work. So that's why you got things a little broken down like that, so that it comes out clean and neat. But in behind the scenes like check jet. So I think that's why all of those things are there.

> P1: But somebody that's like 80 years old. You want it to be like real simple, real easy for them to understand, and make it simple for them to click.

> P1: Also, if it's on a mobile phone. You want it also easy for it to be formulated. Streamlined, simple.

Tyler: Yeah, okay, awesome. So it's almost like it's like a summary of like, kind of the complex thing that's happening behind the scenes.

> P1: Behind the scenes. Yeah.

Tyler: Yeah. So we've got new and we've got solved. And then you mentioned one that could be something like under review that would probably happen in between.

> P1: And that there's things there's more of them, you know. Yeah.

Tyler: And then so what would solved mean? Like, what's the difference between under review and then solved?

> P1: Real world, or PC.

Tyler: You can give me both.

> P1: Okay, real world. Don't call us anymore. That's how Veterans are gonna take it.

Tyler: Yeah, so solved is kind of like, we're done with this.

> P1: You're done. You gotta file a whole new batch of everything.

> P1: That's real world. That's what events gonna look at it.

> P1: Like, for me, I know I'm a hundred percent. The injuries, the many operations, everything. I just had a surgery 2 weeks ago. kay. My independent breakdown of everything is way over a hundred percent. Independently. But I'm at 90.

Tyler: Right.

> P1: Right. So me seeing 90, I'm not happy. Yeah. Imagine me seeing 70. And you say solved. What do you think I'm gonna be saying or thinking?

Tyler: Right. I completely get where you're what you're saying.

> P1: And that's real world, right?

> P1: So when they see that they like oh, f***!

> P!: Now, PC, hey, we've seen what you put everything has been done and case is solved.

Tyler: I think the comparison is useful because that is real, that for the Veteran who, it says solved, they might not feel like it's solved, or their situation's not resolved. Whereas the VA might say, okay, we replied to you, so it's solved.

> P1: That's exactly... The 2 ends of the spectrum.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P1: And you're not talking to a person.

Tyler: How does it make someone feel when it says solved, but it hasn't actually been solved?

> P1: I hate to bring this up this way, but this is exactly what you know reality is, and this is how I had to bring it up with the last group, and they was literally like, you know, I appreciate that, and that's the feedback that we need to take back. But.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P1: That is why you have a person that stands up on a car and have a bunch of records and say, I'm ready to just like make this whole place go.

> P1: What they did when they did that.

> P1: And that's reality.

> P1: Because now I can't even talk to a person.

> P1: My situation. And I, you know, when I even just a fragment of what I told them with the last lady and the it guy that literally the IT guy came off the camera. It was like Bro, I'm so sorry...

> P1: t took me 35 years to get the 1st surgery. The the second surgery made my condition worse, and I just now have a surgery that I just did to try to fix all of that, and I'm having spasms from it, and guess what both of the 2 knees are not even counted.

> P1: The whole incident is redacted.

> P1: And it's because of 2 kids that thought it would be fun to trip me down a mountain during boot camp last week a bootcamp because they was upset, that I became a squad leader, and they didn't. And because of the color of our skin, they were protected because one of them was the son of an officer. And I wasn't.

Tyler: That is awful.

> P1: And in the mix of all of that, because they didn't give me my rating that they should have... I didn't have the medical coverage, and I lost my son. Due to a condition that if they were to just gave me at least 40%, he would have had some kind of coverage.

Tyler: Oh, my goodness.

> P1: So when you realize that. And then they did give me just 20 and they didn't even give me a paycheck for almost 9 years, saying that it was, no, no explanation. Just 9 years, no check. Finally, I get a check, and here's $200. They don't give you a breakdown. No, nothing. Here's a $200 check.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P1: 29 years after, they finally gave me a 20% rating. And then, all of a sudden, here's 200 check. Where W. Where was it? 9 years ago I had to call in, and they tell me, oh, servants pay... My discharge paper says no service pay. So now, where's the money that you took away from me?

> P1: But when you go file your papers and this any other, my answer would have just been... solved.

Tyler: Right.

> P1: You know what I'm saying.

Tyler: 100%.

Tyler: First of all, that's an awful experience –– or experiences to have over many years. And I think it makes me feel sad that folks have to share experiences like that in order for us to do better. But I do appreciate you sharing it with me.

> P1: That's true, and that's just a tip. I mean, I'm just taking the tip of what I've got.

Tyler: For sure. Oh, I can imagine.

> P1: That's why I can relate to.

Tyler: Yeah. And it's why, when you see solved, like, that's frustrating, it's like, it's a lot more than just you know the word on the screen or whatever. So I appreciate you sharing that.

Tyler: And I hope things are better in the future because, people shouldn't have experiences like that.

Tyler: So, do we want to take a couple minutes and grab some water, and then continue?

> P1: Oh, no. I've got some water right here in front of me.

Tyler: Oh good, okay.

Tyler: Alright.

> P1: Do you need to take some a minute to get some water?

Tyler: I have some water here, too, but I appreciate you asking me.

> P1: IT guy? You good?

Tyler: I'm sure Thomas has some water nearby.

> P1: We hope.

Tyler: Yeah, we hope!

Tyler: Well, let's move forward a little bit. We've talked about this screen that that we're kind of staring at for a little bit now.

Tyler: And I think it feels pretty clear to me some of the things that we could change so that it meets your expectations better.

### Question details

Tyler: What we're gonna do now is we're gonna go into one of these questions. So you talked about this link to check the details. So let's go ahead and say, like, we're gonna read, this May 21st question.

Tyler: And we're going to go and check the details.

> P1: So go ahead and click it?

Tyler: Yes, please.

> P1: I really want to know this answer for it. So let's hope this is like, legitimately gonna give me.

Tyler: Yeah. And again, I do want to preface this to say like, I don't want you to take this as your reply.

> P1: No, no, because this is legitimately what they told us do. And we filled out the forms and all that stuff, and we sent it, and we're waiting for them to literally give us a reply. They gave us a reply. Said that they received it.

> P1: And now we're waiting for them to give us the answer.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P1: Like that's real life, like I'm literally telling you in real, like totally where we're at.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: And we talked about this at the beginning, but I don't know a whole lot about the how dependents get healthcare coverage, but I totally believe that it's been a struggle.

> P1: So it shows you right there. It says that it is for people that are at a hundred percent.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P1: I was like, they make it complicated, you know.

> P1: So what if... this is the frustration.

> P1: So you just told me 70%. Then you bring me here and then within the 1st paragraph it says it's for service members, Veterans who are determined, permanently service connected disabled, or whose rating show... or who passed away or die, you know.

> P1 So I'm used to being on Tiktok. So you know, I was about to say unlive lol.

> P1: ...service connected or not otherwise eligible for TriCare. So no, I can't get TriCare, because I'm not retired.

> P1: we do not provide care coverage for veterans. No cause I'm already covered. So that's their concept is, look you, already through the Va, so it's not for you. It's for the wife independent. Please reach out to the.

> P1: So now when you read that whole thing, it's mumble jumbled like, okay, so do I have to be 100? Do I not have to be 100%? 

> P1: It's kind of loaded. So they make you reach out to them. So we did, and then they spell out the same exact thing to you, and then they say, fill out these 2 forms. So you fill out the forms, and they say both the D and the C. But you don't need the C.

> P1: I promise you this.

Tyler: I totally believe you.

> P1: And you gotta have your doctor fill it out. That's not the form that the doctor fills out. Do you understand what I'm trying to tell you?

Tyler: I do. I understand. So it's like you're trying to get information about something. And, I've noticed this, that sometimes the VA's responses are like, no. Instead of no, but you could do this. It's just no.

> P1: Yes, or it's Alice, and it's the rabbit hole.

> P1: So they, if I was to go get my wife right now and tell her that this is literally the conference, because she just got to asking me the answer to this. Have I got feedback from this exact same thing... Yesterday, while driving back from the doctor's thing.

Tyler: Right.

> P1: Because we've been in this rabbit hole specifically in real life. Since November of last year.

> P1: The thing is that form which we had to go to the VA Office to get from the ROI Department and the VA Office. I go see the primary doctor. The primary doctor has says they have a completely different form that he has to fill out.

> P1: To get you a case manager to then initiate and have... This thing just keeps coming up. It's so annoying.

> P1: That he that they have to have signed by the doctor to say that you are in these, this permanent disability and all that stuff thing that he signs off.

> P1: So it's not just this form. This is just the application that you fill in saying that you would like for them to check you out.

Tyler: Yeah, it's almost like they're making it seem  it's easier than you know that it will be as a Veteran who's like going through it?

> P1: Right.

> P1: Yes.

Tyler: Yeah, that's really frustrating.

> P1: This is just, that form right there. Legitimately a cover letter to a bunch of other forms that you do. But they, the other forms, are invisible to you, and it's literally just a cover letter for to to for you to send into them, for them, to put a giant PAL for them to call you and say you need to do more.

> P1: A cover letter for you to say, Hey, I'm interested in this. Can somebody please tell me a little bit more information.

Tyler: Right.

> P1: But you won't even get in the door unless you do that form right? So it's the form for them to tell you. No.

> P1: 100%. True.

Tyler: I totally believe you.

> P1: Sorry cause that has nothing to do. What you was trying to tell us.

Tyler: No, no, no, there's absolutely nothing for you to apologize for.

Tyler: This is, I'm recognizing that this scenario that we've asked you to look at today is actually a very real scenario for you and your family. And so, I think that makes it very hard and very frustrating and real. But it is an example of how a lot of Veterans will feel using something like this.

Tyler: We've got about 15 min left together. So I'm thinking, maybe for the last 15 min.

Tyler: You can stop sharing your screen. There's probably something like a red bar up towards the top of your screen, or a button.

> P1: At the bottom. Yeah.

### Cool down

Tyler: Bottom. Yeah, okay, awesome. And then maybe for the last, like 10 or so minutes, we can just have a conversation about another way that this could all work.

> P1: Give me a second, please.

Tyler: Of course. Yeah.

> P1: I'm sorry the part of my medical condition is if I get triggered it makes it just worse already in an episode. So it's just.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P1: Do you know what [medical condition] is?

Tyler: I don't. No.

> P1: [More about medical condition].

> P1: So it happened after the second knee replacement. It's a high risk. If you have [medical condition].

> P1: Due to the situation that they denied happened.

> P1: I mean it's so much right now.

Tyler: It seems like it might be a good time for us to wind down. Does it help if...

> P1: This is just part of what I'm going through. Just give me a moment.

Tyler: Of course, I'll give you...

> P1: It's just the spasms happen. And yeah.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P1: Because it's all nerves. If you get stressed, or anxiety, or just any of those things that makes the spasms be just worse.

> P1: Again. This didn't happen. Now the doctors have all connected this all to what happened. Still denying it.

Tyler: Right.

> P1: This is the Va.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: Does it help if we take a couple of deep breaths?

> P1: You can if you want, but I'm doing that internally.

Tyler: Okay.

> P1: But I can't take too deep of a breath, because I just came from the spine stimulator, syndrome surgery. It's like literally hurts my spine. So.

Tyler: Right.

> P1: But yes. Hmm. [Breathing].

Tyler: And don't feel like I'm in a rush.

> P1: So what was the next part you want to go through.

Tyler: To be honest with you, you've answered all my questions about the product that we were looking at. I think it was really helpful to get some feedback from you.

Tyler: I have to say, I wish that that scenario didn't hit home for you as much as it did. So I apologize that that's where we are now.

> P1: There's no need to apologize. This is what I deal with every day.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P1: I'm a very transparent person. In fact, you know I have a platform on, you know social media right now, helping others and deal with things that they gotta deal with. And and this is just the you know cross that I have to bear.

> P1: It doesn't matter if it was you on this thing, or if it was another Veteran or another person, that it is what it is.

Tyler: Yeah. I see what you're saying.

Tyler: What do you want to talk about for the next 5 min? And it may be that you're finished talking, which is totally okay.

> P1: Well, how's your day? Your job is to sit there and deal with this on a regular ongoing basis?

Tyler: Yeah. Well, I get the sense that you're the type of person that... sometimes people that are in pain are the best at helping other people with their pain. And that's the feeling I get from you. And you just said you help people on social media. So that makes sense.

Tyler: So I felt very seen by you. And I feel pretty honored to have these conversations with people. Although it's very hard when people explain to me how the VA has left them in these situations.

> P1: Yeah, I appreciate that.

> P1: I just wish that the system wasn't so rigged. And I hope these really do come to what they're meant to come to.

> P1: And it's great, you know, to fix certain little things, but unless it changes what's going on with the actual administration...

Tyler: I hear you. It almost feels a little bit silly to talk about like, should the website say this or this, when there's whole lot more going on in the background.

Tyler: I wish there were more opportunities for us to have a chance to focus on the larger system. I think, it puts someone like yourself, in an especially frustrating position. You can help with this website, but you really want to help with the larger system.

> P1: Yeah, it doesn't help me, doesn't help my situation with bringing my my son back, and since then I lost another.

> P1: And my PTSD is strictly from my anger with the VA not doing s***. It's not towards my harm towards anybody else, but I am 100% completely angry with the VA.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: I can completely understand why you are.

> P1: I'm not going to stop. I lost my son.

> P1: I can't even get anybody to this to understand the amount my body feels like I'm walking out of fire. On a consistent, constant basis.

> P1: And there's nothing I could do about it.

> P1: And that's how most of us feel.

Tyler: Gosh, yeah. That is awful.

> P1: Yeah, sometimes the truth is.

Tyler: Awful, yeah. I'm so sorry that this is all happening to you. It's not just happened to you in the past, like it's I can see how it's happening right now.

> P1: Yeah.

Tyler: I think being angry is a completely, totally normal response to the situation.

> P1: Yeah and, you know, I wanted to be a lifer.

> P1: I was originally recruited to go into [more details about specific program they were recruited into.]

> P1: Could have had any job I wanted. And I crossed over to the marines. Which I don't regret. Not at all. But it was all changed from one incident. I was in Boot Camp for so long that people are recruited in. I watch go by. And I was in there for so long that every drill instructor knew me. That's not good.

> P1: And yes, somebody did commit suicide while I was in there.

> P1: But when they separate you they separate you on the other side. So you in there with the same drone instructors. And I seen it was just a job for them.

> P1: I was an 18 year old, 19 year old. What do you do with that?

> P1: Anyways, did we hit our time?

Tyler: We were just coming up on our time but...

> P1: I'm not worried about me. I'm worried for you. I don't care. I've got nothing to do right now.

Tyler: Well, I'm perfectly happy to sit and chat with you.

Tyler: I think I'm sitting with a lot of emotion after everything you're sharing, which I'm sure, you are too.

> P1: Hit me with your questions. I don't care. They recording it. Let them hear it.

Tyler: I find that, at least for me, it's hard to leave conversations that are heavy and then just be, like, staring at my computer screen on my own, when we end the call.

Tyler: And I'm sure that could be hard for other people. You might not be that person, but it could be hard for others, like it's hard for me.

Tyler: So I think it's worth us like chatting about something that makes you happy, or something you're doing soon that you're excited about. What do you think?

> P1: Well, my son, graduated from high school the other day. This is why I'm having the spasms, because it was a beautiful full day, but you know it was a long, full day.

> P1: But he just graduated from college, but from high school.

> P1: In the last 2 years of high school. He was in Middle college. So he did his high school classes in Junior College, so he actually graduated with... Most of his childhood, you know, mainly leading from his mom. But of course you know things that you support. You support.

> P1: She would do affirmations, and all of those things. "I will be good at that. "I will be a strong Christian, I will be a good father. I will go to college, I will go to..." She put her specifics. I will go to [school] or [school], or this, that the other, and all of this, all of these main big colleges, right.

> P1: And I mean for years, when it came down to it, he wanted to go to [type of school] because his cousin, who he looks up to highly. Her last name is [name]. And we call her [nickname and explanation for nickname]. She went to [school].

> P1: And I guess that kind of follow suit. So when the [type of school] fair comes around, he went to it. And 8 of them gave them offers right then and there.

Tyler: Wow!

> P1: One was [school] and his mom – I could not fly out because of my medical situations. They flew on out there to [state], and went out and visited [school]. Same recruiter was there, met him and walked them around just any other. And so that he took a liking to it, but he also had offers from [school] and some of the other some other good colleges, and they gave him virtual tours and just any other cause we couldn't afford for him to fly out to all of.

> P1: But he really liked [school]. [School] gave him my offer. So did a lot of other ones. Couple of other ones gave them bigger offers.

> P1: So he's going to [school].

Tyler: That's amazing.

> P1: I'm pretty excited, you know, and he's excited about, you know, going. And he has a girlfriend that he's been with for a pretty good, steady moment. They even drop the L Word and everything.

> P1: And she's a phenomenal, you know, young grown into, you know. I'm pretty particular, especially since I've been on social media. And I talk a lot about adult boy and adult girl behavior, you know, versus being an actual man, an actual woman. So. You're a young man growing into becoming a man. So I'm not gonna just cause you hit. Age  doesn't mean that you're a man so, and he understands that. So she's a he's a young man. She's a young, you know, young woman, young lady.

> P1: She's going to [more information about the son's girlfriend's school/career path].

Tyler: Oh, my goodness. They sound like such a good pair.

[More about P1's family.]

> P1: So, that's some good news.

Tyler: That's some really good news.

> P1: Youngest of 6, though we did lose 2. But he's the youngest.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P1: So we're now empty nesters.

Tyler: Well, it sounds like you have a family to be proud of. And I loved hearing that story, and I loved when you mentioned your wife teaching your son or your kids, I'm sure, about affirmations, and saying, I will do this. I will go to [school]. I will [do this]. She sounds like such a good person to have around.

Tyler: I'm grateful to have met you today, and to learn more about your family and I'm sorry for everything that's happened to you, or is happening to you. But I'm hopeful it will get better.

> P1: Well, that's the prayer.

> P1: It's hard. I cannot lie. But, I'm thankful.

> P1: I got a lot of people you know, asking and pray for me, and they ask me all the time, how are you doing?

> P1: I'm hurting.

> P1: But I'm built different. Yeah, that's the best way for me to take it. But that doesn't take away what the VA owes me, and I'm not gonna quit fighting until I get it.

Tyler: Right.

> P1: Cause they owe me, and they owe my family.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P1: You promised me you was going to take out my wisdom teeth. You didn't. You owe me.

> P1: You owe me from when I was hurt.

> P1: I'm not stopping until you fix what you owe.

Tyler: Yeah. Let alone all of the trauma of living with that experience.

> P1: And not just the trauma for me was about the trauma that all my kids went through. They grew up not having a complete dad, not mentally, physically.

> P1: Broke the family up for all kinds of various reasons. So you know, then that was the case. Until they got older and then realized the sacrifices that I did.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P1: Think about that.

> P1: What can you do with that, you know. So we had to do things in a totally different way.

Tyler: It's hard not to feel like the system is against you when things like this happen to you.

> P1: Other than that, though, I have a good relaxed day, and I don't have nothing I could do but rehab.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P1: Okay, I can't even go to physical therapy anymore. Right now, because of this thing in my back that I just had surgery.

Tyler: Mmm.

> P1: [More about medical condition and coping.]

Tyler: Right. Okay, wow.

Tyler: Well, I feel like I could probably talk to you all day... But I think it's probably time for us to wrap up.

> P1: I got one last good thing to tell you guys.

[Explains how they're using TikTok to help young people.]

Tyler: That sounds really cool. That's awesome.

> P1: But I'm not big. I mean the beginning stages. But everybody that's with me are like genuine real connection. So now agencies are trying to come at me, and groups are trying to come at me and follow like piggyback on me and go. Okay, this dude is like starting to build a platform.

Tyler: That's awesome.

> P1: But, yeah, human connection. That's what it's all about.

Tyler: Yeah.

[More wrap up]

> P1: Anyway, you guys have a blessed one. I appreciate you.

Tyler: Awesome. Thank you so much, [P1]. It was great to have a conversation with you today.

> P1: Appreciate you, guys have a good one.

Tyler: Alright, bye now. Take care.

> P1: Alrighty, bye bye.
