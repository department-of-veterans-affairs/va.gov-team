## Intro (5 minutes)

> Start transcript: `LIVE TRANSCRIPT` > `ENABLE`.

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Tyler. How are you?

I’m a researcher from VA. I work on improving VA.gov so it's easier for Veterans to contact VA online if they have a question.

**What I hope to do today** is get a sense of how we can make this process better. 

**What I don't want to do** is add to any frustration that's led you to contact VA in the past or frustration you've had while trying to contact VA. I want to be up front and say that I don't have a way of fixing those past experiences. But, we can talk about your frustration and I hope there's things we can do to improve in the future.

So before we get started, when Perigean set up this session, they asked if you’re okay with a couple of observers joining us. This helps my team members learn from our conversation as well, and they also help me take notes so we capture everything you share.

**I want to confirm now, are you okay with a couple of my teammates joining us to observe?**

- `IF NO` Use Slack to let observers know.
- `IF YES` They're in the waiting room, so I'm going to let them into the meeting now.

> Let in observers from the waiting room.

Welcome. Can everyone say hello? This is `PARTICIPANT`.

**Thanks everyone, now I’ll ask you to turn off your cameras and mute yourselves for the rest of the session.**

There are a few other things I want to mention before we start:

- **This session should take about an hour.** I’ll make sure we finish on time, so I may occasionally move us along during the session, so we can cover everything.
- **We’re here to learn your honest opinions.** Negative feedback is helpful too, because it helps us learn how we can improve.
- **I also want to make it clear that we’re not testing your ability.** So, for example, if I ask if you understand something, it’s because I want to make sure writing is clear.
- **I’m going to share a couple of prototypes with you today.** A prototype is a test version of a website, so it may not work exactly how you expect. For example, you’ll be able to click some things, but not everything. And the prototype has pretend information, not your real information. I don't want it to alarm you if you read anything, because it's all just made up for the purpose of this session.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, you just have to let me know.** And that might be a pause to get some water or to stop the session completely. You'll be paid even if we don't complete the full session.
- Last thing is about recordings. We can record the session to help us confirm we captured your opinions accurately and sometimes share video clips with our colleagues at VA. If we do this, we don’t link anything you share in the session to any information that could identify you. We remove your face and your name from the videos. **Knowing this, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
  - `IF NO` Don't record
  - `IF YES` Once I start recording, I’ll confirm again.

> Start recording: `RECORD TO CLOUD`.

I’ve started recording. I'd like to confirm again: **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?**

## Warm up (5 minutes)

It seems like we’re ready to get started. I'd like to begin by learning more about your experience with the VA and our online services.

- So, how long have you been a Veteran?
- How often do you contact the VA right now?
- Have you ever contacted the VA using Ask VA or the VA chatbot?
- When you think about having a good experience contacting the VA, what is most important to you?

Thanks. That's really helpful background for me.

I also want to ask you some questions about automation.

When I say automation, I'm talking about when we use computers to do work that people normally have to do manually. Like having a helper who can summarize an article for you or give you a recommendation.

- Do you know if you've ever used an online tool or service that includes automation?
- Is it always obvious when something has been automated?
- Is it important to know when something has been automated?
- Do you have any hesitations or concerns about automation?
- If you think about your interactions with the VA, can you think of any ways automation could make things easier?

Awesome. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. 

<details>
  <summary>Key things to notice</summary>

- Why do they choose to contact VA (instead of going elsewhere or doing another task)?
- How do they decide which channel to use when they contact the VA?
- Have they used or heard of Ask VA or chatbot?
- Do they recognize when something is automated? How does this change their experience either way?
- What are their key hopes and fears with automation?

</details>

## Set up (5 minutes)

Now, we're going to shift gears.

In the Zoom chat, I'm going to send you a link to a prototype. I mentioned earlier a prototype is like a test version of a website. It might not work perfectly and we're sometimes going to need to use our imagination. I'll help guide you through it.

> Send link in Zoom chat.

I just sent you a link in the Zoom chat.

- Can you open the link?
- Have you shared your screen on Zoom before?
  - `IF YES` Great. Can you please share your screen?
  - `IF NO` I’ll walk you through how to do that…

Thanks! Now I’m able to see your screen too.

> Screen: Prototype A, B or C depending on the session. The order to show the prototypes is noted in our schedule.

Okay, so now let me tell you a little bit about this website.

We're on VA.gov and this is a tool called Ask VA. Ask VA is a form that you can use to ask the VA a question. It can be a question about education, disability compensation, health care. Lots of things.

I'm going to show you 3 different concepts. In all 3 concepts, you're asking the VA a question. 

I'll ask you some question as we go through each concept and eventually we'll compare all 3 concepts.

Does this all sound okay?

## Cool down (5 minutes)

Okay, we’re all finished looking at the prototypes. You can stop sharing your screen now.

> Stop sharing screen

I’d love to spend some time reflecting before we finish.

We looked at 3 different ideas. I'm curious...

- Which idea stood out to you the most? You can try and describe what you remember.
- Is there anything (else) you liked?
- Is there anything that you didn't like?
- All 3 of these ideas provided a suggestion to you. Did you prefer when they suggested what your question was about or they suggested helpful links?
- Did any of these ideas involve automation?
- If something is automated, does that make you trust it more or less?
- Are you familiar with the term data model? [A data model is like a blueprint that helps define how data is collected, stored, and analyzed.]
- If I told you that we're recommending something based on a data model we used, what does that mean to you?
- Is there anything else you'd like to share with me?

<details>
  <summary>Key things to notice</summary>
  
- What did they like and what would they change?
- Do submitters recognize when something uses automation?
- How does automation impact their trust, if at all?
- Do submitters recognize or describe other ways they expect Ask VA to use automation?
- Are people familiar with data models?

</details>
   
Well, I think you've answered all of my questions.

Thanks again for sharing your time with me. It’s been so helpful to learn from you.

**Do you have any questions for me?**

Okay, well thank you so much for the time.

Perigean will send you a thank you note with some information that you can pass along to other Veterans if they’d like to participate in future research sessions. 

I hope you have a lovely rest of the day.

## Pause or exit strategies

We can use this strategies to prepare for difficult situations.

### If the participant isn't feeling well

I'm sorry you're [not feeling well]. Do you feel up for continuing? You'll be paid even if we stop early.

> If they choose to continue...

Okay, just let me know if you change your mind.

### If the participant is showing signs of upset or distress

This sounds so hard. Would you like to take a break or stop?

> If they choose to take a break and come back...

Welcome back. I'm interested to hear more about [topic you left off on]. Are you up for continuing or would you prefer we move to the next topic?

### If the participant decides to stop

Thank you for your time today, I completely understand your decision to stop.

> If they seem distressed...

Before you go, the VA Hotline number is 988, it's a confidential helpline, and it's 24/7. It's up to you whether you call.

### If the participant is fine to continue, but you aren't

I hear that you're okay to continue. Before we do, I realized that I need a minute. I'm going to turn off my camera and microphone, and get a glass of water. Is that okay with you? I'll be back in 3 minutes.

> If you're still not able to continue, after you pause...

Thanks for letting me take a break. You didn't do anything wrong, but I'm realizing that I'm not going to be able to continue this session. You will still be paid for the full time. I really appreciate you sharing with me today. Is it okay with you if we stop? Thanks very much.
