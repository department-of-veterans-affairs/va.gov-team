Tyler: All right. So are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio today?

> P7: Yes.

Tyler: Okay, awesome.

Tyler: All right. So let's get started before we look at some prototypes together. I just want to learn a little bit more about you and your experience with the Va. How long have you been a veteran?

> P7: How long? How I initially applied to the big game back in 2014. I believe it was.

Tyler: Okay.

> P7: Oh, I was in the United States Air Force, or injuries that in my future.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: Gotcha. So you Left the Air Force, and then you there was a a period of time where you weren't in touch with the Va and it sounds like, about 10 years ago you started interacting with the Va.

Tyler: How often do you interact with the Va. Right now, do you like use the Va. For your healthcare, for example.

> P7: Yes, I do. I most recently been doing video conferences for health, well-being, and all of that. Using the tablet for those.

Tyler: you've been using the tablet for those ones.

Tyler: Okay, gotcha.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So you're talking to your doctors on a video call. Sometimes. Are there other ways that you contact the Va.

> P7: No other than landline attempting to make contact with the local or the closer facilities.

> P7: If I may be honest. Each time we try to call, we end up getting the central or main number, and then it's very simple.

> P7: But do live in a rural area here in [location], and I'm using Starlink for my satellite service. Internet service. So it does get interrupted.

> P7: Awesome.

Tyler: Okay, Gotcha, and why is it confusing when you land, you end up with the central Va. Number? Can you explain that to me?

> P7: If I call, let's say I call [location].

> P7: Can you hear me?

Tyler: Yes, I can.

> P7: Okay, something changed there. If I call the [location] clinic, if they don't answer right away, I guess it switches to the National. Then the National asks you all the same questions again, and then you may have to wait to get a response back.

> P7: It was a little confusing for a while.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. So you're sort of talking to the national group, and they're having to like liaison with the local clinic.

> P7: Yes.

Tyler: Okay.

> P7: Seem to have, they seem to have access directly to the clinic, and do attempt to put it transfer the call to that clinic. They do make an effort to do that. But I guess maybe because of the Wi-fi service, it doesn't always work.

Tyler: Okay, Gotcha.

Tyler: Alright so. And one more question for you. Have you ever heard of Ask Va.

> P7: Right off hand, no.

Tyler: Okay, no worries. And what about the Va Chatbot.

> P7: No, I haven't used that.

Tyler: Okay, perfect. Well, we're going to talk a little bit more about ask Va. Today. But, [P7], when you think about your experiences contacting the Va. In the past or in the future. What do you think? Having a good experience, looks like what is most important to have a good experience.

> P7: They are able to answer the questions I may have. Or they can refer me to somebody, you know.

> P7: Get that in.

Tyler: Okay, Gotcha. So their response is really important.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, cool. I'm gonna ask you a couple of questions that are a little bit different now. So one of the things we're gonna talk about today is automation. And when I say automation, I'm talking about when we use a computer to do something that a person would normally have to do manually, so it could be like having a helper who summarizes an article for you. Or gives you a recommendation.

Tyler: So do you know, if you've ever used a tool or a service that that uses some type of automation like this.

> P7: I don't.

Tyler: Yeah, sounds good. So you don't recall. Or maybe it's never been obvious to you. If it was, if something had been using automation.

> P7: Correct.

Tyler: That makes sense.

Tyler: If I tell you, you know, we're gonna use a tool that includes some automation. How does that make you feel. Do you have any hesitations, or excitement, or any feelings.

> P7: Well, if it makes it a little easier, I'd be happier. Yes.

Tyler: Okay, so you're open to it. If it makes something easier for you.

Tyler: yeah, that makes sense alright.

Tyler: why don't we get started. So we're gonna look at some prototypes now, and so in order to do this, I'm gonna ask you to share your screen on zoom do you know, if you've ever done that before?

Tyler: Okay, that's okay. So we're gonna do this together. So when you're on your phone, you can see my face right now right.

> P7: Correct.

Tyler: Okay, so let's click on your screen, just like in the middle of the screen to kind of wake it up.

Tyler: And you should see some controls now, so there should be a green control that says Share.

Tyler: Do you see something that says share?

Tyler: Oh.

> P7: And away shared. It's an arrow.

Tyler: Okay, an arrow that's perfect. Yeah, let's click on that

Tyler: Let me know what happens. Once you click on that arrow.

> P7: Here we go.

> P7: Okay. It shows the screen photos, dropbox in a sec.

Tyler: Oh, perfect. Okay, let's click on the one that says, screen.

> P7: I'm on screen.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: And now, what's it showing?

> P7: It has zoom chat.

Tyler: Okay, it has zoom checked. Okay?

Tyler: And what else does it say?

> P7: Start broadcast.

Tyler: Oh, perfect! Let's click start broadcast.

Tyler: and I'll let you know when it starts. perfect.

> P7: There now?

Tyler: Yes, awesome. So now, [P7], I can see what you're seeing. So it says, screen broadcast. Right?

Tyler: So let's click, just towards the top of the screen where it says, everything on your screen, let's just click that text.

Tyler: Okay, perfect. So now I'm seeing your screen. And then can you click in the middle of your screen for me?

> P7: What again? I'm sorry.

Tyler: That's okay. Can you click in the middle of the screen? Okay, perfect. So see down there at the bottom, we have some controls. Let's click on the one that says chat.

Tyler: So that's all the way to the left. And it has.

Tyler: Yeah, the one that says chat.

Tyler: Yes, that's perfect, the one with 4 numbers perfect. There we are. Okay, awesome. So I'm gonna send you a link in the chat. So I haven't sent it yet. I'm just copying it. So I just sent you a link, and if you can go ahead and click on that link for me.

> P7: There's you go!

Tyler: Yes.

Tyler: sorry. There's a loud car outside my house. I don't know if you can hear it. Yeah, that's...

> P7: No.

Tyler: Okay, so see where it says. Https. Oh, perfect, awesome, all right. So.

> P7: It was covered by move up arrow.

Tyler: Yes, it was covered. I saw that as well.

Tyler: Okay, perfect. So, and just to confirm [P7], you can't hear the really loud music.

> P7: I can't hear any.

Tyler: Okay, okay, cool. Alright. So we're all set up here with this 1st prototype that we're gonna look at. My face is on your screen, and what you can do is you can put your finger on my face and just swipe it away.

Tyler: perfect. All right. So we're all set up now. So let me tell you a little bit about what we're doing. We are gonna we're on va.gov. This is a prototype. So it's like a pretend version of va.gov, and we're gonna use a tool called ask Va.

Tyler: Ask VA is a form that you can use to contact the Va online.

Tyler: So you could have a question about education or disability compensation, a lot of different topics. And you would use this tool to fill out a form and then send that to the Va. And then they'll, you know, send you back a response. Okay.

Tyler: we're gonna go through 3 different versions of

Tyler: ask Va, so on the 1st one. That's what we're looking at right now. We're going to go through this together. I'm going to ask you some questions, and then we're going to go through the process again, and it's going to feel similar. But it's going to be a little bit different. Okay, so let's start with this first, st this 1st one

### Concept C

Tyler: and so the 1st thing I want you to tell me is, what would you do on this page?

> P7: Go down to the block area there, and that's on it, and then type in whatever my question.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: cool. That sounds pretty straightforward. So because this is a prototype, we can't type in this today. But what you can do is just click on that box that you mentioned. And we'll pretend, like you've typed in your question.

Tyler: Perfect. So your question.

> P7: Yeah, what resources are available? Yes.

Tyler: Perfect. Yeah. So your question today is going to be what resources are available for veterans who need support with mobility or assistive devices. And I can remind you of the question whenever you need me to.

Tyler: So, after you typed in your question, what would you do next? Can you show me continue.

Tyler: Okay, perfect. Let's click. Continue.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: Now, you can scroll down and let me know what this page is about.

> P7: And then you would away.

> P7: Category for the question.

> P7: I think I may have used this once.

Tyler: All right.

> P7: Not knowing.

Tyler: Nice.

> P7: Have used it. Because if I go to select category, okay, education benefits stability.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So this is looking familiar.

Tyler: And then we selected healthcare. Why did you select healthcare?

> P7: That's what I've been using the most. I either communicate with my primary physician or his office personnel, or, most recently, the wellness program.

Tyler: Hmm, okay. So you chose healthcare because it's familiar to you. It's something you often contact the Va about. That makes sense.

Tyler: So in today's scenario. We're going to say that your question to the Va. Is what resources are available for veterans who need support with mobility or assistive devices. So if that was your question, tell me which category you would choose.

Tyler: and you can. It's a little tricky. But, [P7], you can scroll down so if you open that menu up again where you clicked healthcare.

> P7: I see it.

> P7: I, and what you said my question would have been.

Tyler: Yeah, your questions about your questions about mobility or assistive devices.

> P7: Okay, then automobile adaptive. Maybe medical supplies.

Tyler: Okay.

> P7: I have all those items. Yes.

Tyler: Okay, Gotcha.

Tyler: All right. Let's scroll up a little bit.

> P7: Up, back, up.

Tyler: Yeah, that's perfect. We can sit right here and let's click on where it says healthcare that menu that you were showing me earlier. So if you click...

Tyler: perfect, and then it's a little tricky, but you should be able to scroll down. So if you put your finger a little higher up on your screen.

Tyler: There you go, perfect.

> P7: Not in the box.

Tyler: Yeah, it's a little tricky. So now we're looking at a list of options, right? So if your question was about mobility or assistive devices. Which option do you think you would choose?

Tyler: Oh.

> P7: Like you say it's tricky, because every time you touch it, and now I'm at the max of the screen. and I don't know if I'm seeing all of all of the.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: yeah, that is tricky. So when you go through this list, what's going through your mind? Is it difficult to make a decision? Or do you have an idea of what you might choose? And you just want to see the full list, to be sure.

> P7: I would want to see the whole list.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P7: Benefits from that doesn't apply to what we're, but I don't think. I don't even see it there. As to what we were talking.

Tyler: Okay. So you're not seeing an option that relates to what we were talking about. Right?

> P7: No, I do not see it.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense. All right, let's go ahead and make any selection. So you can go ahead and click healthcare.

Tyler: Just so we can close this list.

Tyler: And now we have this other, this other text on the page that you were reading earlier, what is this text.

> P7: Helpful resources.

> P7: Equipment again, order supplies which I would use.

> P7: Yeah, you know. Let's say I would say, order medical supplies for my CPAP or something.

> P7: Yeah.

Tyler: Yeah, okay, so you, on this list, it feels like you're maybe more interested in clicking one of these options. Right?

Tyler: Yeah, okay.

Tyler: And you might click CPAP supplies. Why might you click on that order? Medical supplies.

> P7: I have a contact person in [location]. Supplies me with my CPAP item. So I'm assuming I might directly get him through that.

Tyler: okay, so you're thinking, maybe you would click on that link because it might take you to somebody that you've, you've worked with in the past. Right?

Tyler: All right, that makes sense. So, let's [P7]. Let's scroll up a little bit more. I just have, like a few last questions on this prototype. So see how it says here, select the category that best describes your question.

Tyler: and then down below it says, helpful resources.

Tyler: Is there a difference between those 2 parts of the page.

> P7: Well. yeah, it appears to be a lot of difference. because you're you're covering more subjects on your select bar up there where I have healthcare. I guess that's it appears to offer more.

Tyler: So it feels like it's offering more choices. And you said, it's covering more subjects.

Tyler: We'll take a moment now just to kind of reflect. I'm curious, [P7], at any point in this process. Anything we've looked at so far. Did you feel like any? Anything? Was automated.

> P7: I'd have to assume. It is because you're it's providing the information.

> P7: Okay, size.

Tyler: Yeah. So the fact that it's provided you information might be a result of automation.

Tyler: that makes sense. Let's do this. Let's move on to the next concept. So we're going to look at our second prototype.

### Concept A

Tyler: And so, [P7], you're gonna need to return to zoom. So what you can do is you can usually click. See at the top of your screen where it says 11 0 5, it says the time, and it's red.

Tyler: I think if you click on that it may bring you back to me on zoom, let's see. 

> P7: it's on screen broadcast.

Tyler: Okay, we want to keep the screen broadcast.

> P7: End screen broad cast?

Tyler: No, let's keep, I think, let's not click on anything yet.

Tyler: What about this? Is there a way for you to find the different apps on your screen so often for my phone. I'll like, put my finger towards the bottom of my screen, and then I swipe up and I'll be able to see different applications. Do you know, if that's possible on your phone.

> P7: it won't let me out of it. Won't let me out of this screen right now, because it says screen.

Tyler: Okay, that's okay. Let's stop the screen broadcast then, that might help, yeah, perfect. Okay. So now we're not screen broadcasting. And you're back on Zoom.

> P7: Oh, don't know!

Tyler: Okay, what are you seeing on your phone?

Tyler: You can see me.

> P7: I push that I push that arrow, and I can.

Tyler: You can see me. Okay, okay, Gotcha.

Tyler: All right, perfect. So now we're going to do the same thing again. I'm gonna have you?

Tyler: start your screen broadcast. So you're gonna click that green arrow.

> P7: Time.

Tyler: We're gonna yeah, the one that says share.

> P7: Oh! Did I lose you?

Tyler: I'm still here.

> P7: I'm lost.

Tyler: Yeah, that's okay. So why don't we do this? Tell me what you're looking at.

> P7: I'm looking at you at the top of the screen, and then meeting Chat, going to call, you jump to 1st unread message and then on the bottom I have that these share all of that again.

Tyler: Okay, perfect. So on the bottom where it says share and all of that, let's click on share.

> P7: All right. I'm back again, and it's stream photos in Icloud drive.

Tyler: Perfect. We'll choose screen, and then we'll choose. Start broadcast.

> P7: Oh, I see zoom again! Check.

Tyler: Perfect. Okay, awesome. So now I can see your screen and let's click towards the like, the top half of your screen. Let's click up there.

Tyler: Okay, awesome. And now let's click in the middle of the screen. So we can see those controls.

Tyler: Okay, perfect. And then we'll just navigate to where it says chat.

> P7: And where might that be?

Tyler: Okay, sorry the controls are gone. So, you're good. So.

> P7: I lost everything. Hold on.

Tyler: No worries perfect. You're back. Yeah.

> P7: Can see what I'm looking at. Correct.

Tyler: Yes, yeah, I can see what you're looking at, which is really helpful. So let's click where it says you are sharing screen. Let's click in the middle of the screen.

Tyler: Awesome, and then at the very bottom, it says chat right?

Tyler: Oh, it! It disappeared.

Tyler: Okay, perfect. So I'm gonna send you a new link. So it's this one here that I sent at 11 0, 9.

Tyler: And we'll click on that one

Tyler: perfect, so we'll give that a minute to load and you can swipe my face away again if you like. So you can click on my face and then move it away. Yeah, perfect. Okay.

Tyler: awesome. So we're going to do a very similar thing now, [P7]. So we are pretending like we are filling out a form.

Tyler: and we're going to send a question to the Va.

Tyler: So we're going to go through a couple of questions, and then eventually, the Va. Is going to receive your question so that they can answer it. Right?

Tyler: Okay, perfect. So we've done this before. Let's just go ahead and pretend like we wrote in our question. So you can click on your question. That box

Tyler: perfect, and our question will be the same. So our question is about mobility or assistive devices, and then we'll click. Continue like you did before.

Tyler: and let's scroll down.

Tyler: and we won't click on anything yet, but I'd like you to tell me about this page. What does this page tell you?

> P7: Disability, compensation edit. So I'm assuming that if I hit that I can either put in a different question, or it'll come up with a menu question.

Tyler: Correct.

Tyler: Okay, so you're thinking, if so, why do you think it says disability compensation, right? Now.

> P7: That's probably the 1st question a lot of people ask. Or inquire about.

Tyler: Okay, so your question is about mobility or assistive devices. Do you think that relates to disability compensation?

> P7: No.

Tyler: Yeah. So then why do you think it says disability compensation? Do you think it made a mistake? Or do you think we're confused?

> P7: Well, I mean, I can understand why it might ask that if compensation could be other than  monetary, it could be benefits. Other benefits. Hearing aids in the spectrum.

> P7: But if I hit edit, would it change?

Tyler: Yeah, we're going to do that in a minute. So we will get to see what happens if we click edit. So you're saying it might be it might have chosen compensation because it could be about like. For example, hearing aids, you might need disability compensation in order to get hearing aids.

Tyler: Right?

> P7: Yes.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: Say that one.

> P7: To be honest with you, to be honest with you. As soon as you see that you're thinking money wise. At least I am. I am. I'm not thinking about equipment. I'm thinking about compensation. Maybe I don't understand the word correctly.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: That's a good point. So you're saying, you can see how it might be related, but it feels a little bit different, because disability compensation is talking about money and being compensated for something versus maybe being given a mobility or assistive device.

Tyler: Okay, yes, that makes sense. So it looks like, maybe this isn't the correct category. And you've been curious about clicking edit. Let's go ahead and click edit and see what happens.

> P7: And I do question why it jumps right to that.

> P7: I think I would have gone back to health care.

Tyler: Healthcare. Let's click healthcare. If that's what you think might make more sense.

Tyler: And do we need to do anything else to continue.

> P7: That is, save or cancel.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: What do you think save means.

> P7: That it'll be the primary thing that comes up 1st every time you go there.

Tyler: Hmm, okay.

> P7: Saving you're saving it as the main objective victory, trying to go to.

Tyler: Okay, gotcha, yeah. So it seems like, maybe it'll be like a default setting. That's what you're thinking.

Tyler: Okay, okay, let's click save.

Tyler: all right So now, yeah, what's happened now? We saved healthcare, and it's.

> P7: That I can change that again by going to edit.

Tyler: Okay, say, can you say that last bit for me? One more time.

> P7: It goes edit, which means that I could change that if I didn't think it was correct. And if I wanted to continue in the questioning of the healthcare items, go on, continue.

Tyler: Okay, I see. So if you think healthcare is correct, you would go on and click, continue and then that's gonna take you down like this healthcare route. Right?

Tyler: That that makes sense. Let's click continue. Let's see what happens.

Tyler: And then tell me about this page.

> P7: Right. And then, as your topics, we think, topic, okay, prosthetics. Okay.

> P7: They gave me the ability to edit it. Assuming you don't have other things listed like area other than prospect. That would be good.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: that makes sense. So I'm kind of thinking that let me say this back to you. It seems like you're happy that it says prosthetics, because that feels like you're getting closer to the right place, and the fact that it says edit means you will be able to make a you know, a small change or a shift in the choice, and you'll get where you want to go. Which might be like CPAP.

Tyler: Okay, gotcha. So. And is it true that prosthetics is part of healthcare?

> P7: Sure.

Tyler: Okay, gotcha. Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: all right. And how did it choose prosthetics like you asked it a question. And then you said, I think it's about healthcare. How did it choose prosthetics?

> P7: Something you might need, or you wanted to look at. I don't know why. It shows that in particular.

Tyler: Yeah, okay, that's okay. So we're not exactly sure. But it might be because, like, it's something that you want, you want to look at

Tyler: all right.

### Concept B

Tyler: So, [P7], in the interest of time, I would like you to have a chance to see the last

Tyler: concept or our 3rd prototype. So what I'm gonna do is have you see that little arrow? Where you had my face used to be? And there's a little arrow there now.

> P7: Yeah.

Tyler: Can you click on that arrow and just sort of like, bring my face back perfect. Okay? And then let's click on my face.

Tyler: Awesome. Alright. So now we're back in the chat, and let's just stay there for a minute, and I'm gonna send you one more link.

Tyler: and I haven't sent it yet. Sorry 1 min.

Tyler: All right. I just sent that link for you, and it's the one I sent at 1117,

Tyler: if you don't mind opening that. So it's that last one. Yeah, at the bottom.

Tyler: Perfect.

Tyler: Alright. So we'll give it a minute to load, and we're going to do the same thing. You can move my face if you like.

Tyler: Perfect.

Tyler: And this is going to look really similar to start. So you can show me your question by clicking on that box.

Tyler: and your question is still about mobility or assistive devices.

Tyler: and then we'll go ahead and continue.

Tyler: And then let's take a look at this page together.

Tyler: Tell me what you're seeing on this page.

> P7: This suggestion is based on similar questions that other veterans have asked.

> P7: Hey, there your question. Get it.

> P7: That's much clearer.

Tyler: That's much clearer. Okay, tell me why it's much clearer.

> P7: In the fact that it gives you the. It says, Okay, we've had these questions asked by other veterans.

Tyler: Hmm.

> P7: Get you a starting point, but then it goes your question, and then allows you to ask.

Tyler: Okay. So it's much clearer, because.

> P7: This one better.

Tyler: Yeah, I can tell. That's awesome. So let's talk more about why we like this one better. So you like that. It says like it gave you a starting point, as you said, and that's like it's telling you we used. We're giving you a suggestion based on what other questions veterans have asked right? And that feels like. Is that is that just making this more clear for you?

> P7: It is for me. I feel better about it, because it's not directing me to something I may not understand, or doesn't make sense to you. It's saying a suggested topic. And it also says, this is something somebody else has asked. But it's not necessarily what I was asking.

Tyler: Okay.

> P7: I have the option to ask what I'm looking.

Tyler: Okay, Gotcha. So you like that, it's giving you a suggestion. So you're not starting from 0, and that it's you can change it in some sense, why does it say we think your question is about disability compensation, and relates to how to file a claim.

> P7: Did we not?

> P7: I'm not sure how they that came up.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P7: Initial when we 1st started all this.

Tyler: Yeah, okay, I'm gonna tell you a little bit about why it says that. Okay, so you typed in a question, right? And your question in this case was about mobility or assistive devices.

Tyler: And so then we went to the next page, and the system told you. Based on other veterans who have asked similar questions. We think your question is about disability, compensation.

Tyler: Does that make more sense?

> P7: Yes, okay, it does.

Tyler: It does.

> P7: Good, though.

Tyler: Okay. And I feel like it's not. That's not made sense yet. Right? If that's been a little bit unclear.

> P7: Say that again.

Tyler: Yeah, no worries. It seems like it's been a little bit unclear. Why, it's making the suggestion disability compensation until I explained it.

> P7: Until you explained it. Yes.

Tyler: Gotcha.

> P7: I think that the thing is most times when you're going to have Veterans that are going to inquire about those.

> P7: And that's probably the number. One question disability compensation relates to how to file a claim. You know the thing everybody's asking today.

Tyler: Hmm.

> P7: About getting it.

> P7: Actually, since that chat, or whatever that passed in the last couple of years.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P7: Everybody's wanting to know.

> P7: Am I eligible for any?

> P7: That would be the logical question right off the bat? But the idea that that you have the ability to edit that question and ask whatever you're actually wanting to look up.

Tyler: Hmm, okay.

> P7: That's why I'm more comfortable with it.

Tyler: Yeah, I can see that.

Tyler: And so we're thinking, maybe it says disability compensation, because a lot of veterans ask about disability compensation and have questions about it which I think that makes sense. Maybe it's trying to suggest to you what is very common, where I'm wondering now about this area where it says your question. So you've liked that you can have the option of editing your question. Can you read the question to me?

> P7: "What resources are available for Veterans who need support with mobility and assistive devices." That was that was the initial question, isn't it?

Tyler: It is. Yeah, it is the initial question, why does it show the initial question again?

> P7: I would think it's reminding me how you got there.

Tyler: Hmm, okay.

> P7: But, I didn't even look at that. After that I looked at your question and edit. Because the above did not apply to what I was looking for.

> P7: If you understand what I'm trying to.

Tyler: Yes, I do understand. That makes sense. So you didn't actually look at like what the question text was, because what it said above, with disability. Compensation didn't apply. So can I say it back to you? This is what it seems like. It's what's happening. It seems like you read, we think your question is about disability, compensation. And so you assumed the question was a question about disability compensation that you could then change to whatever your question was about.

> P7: That is right. That's right.

Tyler: Gotcha. That makes sense. Okay. I can see how that's not clear. And

Tyler: what I'd like you to do is click on edit.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So we're so now we're looking at this question. And if we made an edit to this question, so let's say, we made our question more specific. Let's say we said, I need a walking cane.

Tyler: And then we updated our question, what do you think would happen if we did that?

> P7: I hope it would go to.

> P7: Well, it's probably gonna go back to that question.

> P7: Resources available work with mobility. And if I put in there. I wanted a walking cane.

> P7: I don't know where it would go.

> P7: I would hope it would show me how I might get further information about that.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: yeah, so you're not exactly sure what would happen. But you're hoping, you would get further information about whatever your question is about.

> P7: Correct.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense.

### Cool down

Tyler: So, [P7], let's go ahead and spend a couple of minutes just chatting to each other so you can click that arrow where my face is.

Tyler: so it'll be yeah perfect. And then just click on my face.

Tyler: And then hopefully, you're just able to see me there perfect.

Tyler: Oh, that's a chat. Okay, let's see those controls at the bottom of your screen. It says reactions. And then it says, Stop, share. Let's click, stop. Share.

Tyler: Okay.

> P7: Now you're at the top.

Tyler: Okay. Now you see me.

> P7: Hear this sound.

Tyler: Okay, awesome. So.

> P7: Sorry.

Tyler: Yeah. No worries.

> P7: Looking at the same thing screen broadcasting.

> P7: I'm not.

451
00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:47.650
Tyler: I'm not looking at your... go ahead.

> P7: Okay, there you are. You're back in the middle.

Tyler: Okay, okay, good. Awesome. All right. Well, [P7], 1st of all, thank you so much for putting up with all of the technology like changing and going here and whatnot. You've done a really great job with that and I know it wasn't super simple today, because we had to open 3 different links.

Tyler: I just want to spend a little time talking before we wrap up. We looked at a couple of different things today, and I got the sense that they were all a little bit confusing, but I think it helped me understand what would be more ideal for you.

Tyler: So when we think about if you were contacting the Va. And the Va. Asked you to fill out a form. So they, you know, sometimes you go to a website and they'll say, contact us, and there'll be a form you need to fill out.

Tyler: You hear what could make that process easy for you like what's helpful when you're filling out a form for the Va. And you're asking them a question. What are you hoping for?

> P7: An immediate answer, or one as soon as possible, and I see most time it'll take up to 7 days. Well you get impatient, especially as you get older, like I am.

Tyler: yeah.

> P7: That answers your question?

Tyler: That does answer my question. So you're it seems like it's most important that it is a timely response when you're contacting the Va. And we talked about how 7 business days doesn't really feel quick enough.

Tyler: What if instead of answering your question in 7 days, the Va. Said, you know, here's a link. Why don't you read more information? And maybe this will answer your question for you. So, instead of talking to a person, it gives you a link to information. How would that make you feel.

> P7: Oh, yeah, in today's world, I would imagine it's the norm. For my time in life. I'm wanting to speak to a person. Automation. Sometimes it's very annoying for older people. I guess one has to learn to adapt to today's changes. If you were to give me a direct [information] and it answers what I'm [asking], I'd be okay with it.

Tyler: That's some good nuance like you're talking about how it can be annoying. And automation is sometimes a little bit tricky and that being said, if if they gave you a link to information that directly answered your question, then it would be okay? Because you'd have that timely response.

> P7: Correct.

Tyler: Okay.

> P7: Maybe as we get older we get little less patient.

Tyler: Yeah, I think, that's okay. I think I'm a little bit younger than you. But I also can get impatient. So I completely understand.

Tyler: Do you usually call the VA when you need to get in touch? If you have a question.

> P7: No, I have been using.

> P7: They're using my iPad or my phone to do the [secure] messaging.

Tyler: The messaging. Okay, is that so? Is that when you're doing secure messaging with your doctor?

Tyler: Okay, okay, got it.

Tyler: So sometimes you're messaging your doctor through secure messaging. Is that how does that process work well for you or not? Well.

> P7: It has been recently, like, I said, I was enrolled in a wellness program through the name of the program, and when we had a question for structures in that go on, and they would respond pretty quick.

> P7: And then, most recently, I had one with a dietician was explaining various things, power your meals and things, and she immediately answered, so that's a great feeling.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P7: They get back with you as soon as possible.

> P7: I'm not the only Veteran in the world, so I realize you know they can't [answer everyone] all at once, but. That messaging services do it. Very good.

Tyler: that's awesome to hear. I'm really happy that you've had that experience. And it goes back to what you said earlier that the timeliness is really important to you. So if somebody gets back to you more quickly, that means a lot to you, right.

> P7: Correct.

Tyler: Yeah, yeah, I can see that.

Tyler: Okay, [P7], I realize that we have now just come up on the hour. So I don't want to take too much more of your time. But thank you so much for joining us today. Do you have any questions for me?

> P7: No, I appreciate the work you're all trying to do and trying to improve the systems.

> P7: I may be wrong, but I would think the vast majority veterans. They are a little elderly or older. I guess I'm not thinking about the 2000 efforts and everything. And there's a lot of veterans from that.

> P7: Like my era from Vietnam, and that, you know we're up there and necessarily involve lines on the phones. And all of this your work is important and I'm grateful.

Tyler: Well, we really appreciate it, and I could say the same to you. It's really helpful for us when we can talk to veterans, because it's 1 of the best ways for us to tell. If we're doing, we're making the right decisions, or if we should make something work differently. So it's really useful, and we really appreciate your time. And I hope that you're able to do another research session with the Va. In the future.

Tyler: and if you have any questions after we hang up, you can contact Shannon. She's gonna send you an email when we finish. And it'll just say, Thank you and give you some information for other veterans if they'd like to do something like this in the future.

Tyler: And I think that's all for me. I hope you have a lovely start to your week.

> P7: Appreciate that very much, and I hope so. We just moved into a new home.

> P7: We downsized [...] I really, I really wanted to do this on my Va tablet. Wouldn't let me do it, and I don't understand why, and I tried to call and see if I could get some help, but something wrong, but hopefully, after, if I ever do this again, it will be on a tablet.

Tyler: Yeah, that's totally fine. I'm sure you didn't do anything wrong. It can be a little bit tricky to figure out why it is or isn't working. Maybe next time you're doing research, the person who sets up the call for you? The one that's like telling you information about where to be and giving you the link and everything, you can reach out to them. You can even ask them to get on a call and help you make sure that everything's working ahead of time if that's helpful for you.

Tyler: but yeah, I think you made it work. I know the feeling of your house being scattered around you and trying to go about your business, so I appreciate you making it work, and I hope you you both get to settle a little bit over the next month.

> P7: Okay, well, thank you so much. You guys have a great day.

Tyler: Yeah, you, too. Bye-bye.
