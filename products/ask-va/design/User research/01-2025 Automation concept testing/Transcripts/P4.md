Tyler: Alright. So I just want to confirm that you are comfortable. If I record my screen and audio today.

> P4: I am.

Tyler: Awesome.

Tyler: all right. So that was a lot of information. And I know you haven't participated with doing research at the Va. Before. Do you have any questions for me at this point.

> P4: No! At the moment. No.

Tyler: Okay, awesome. So before we look at some prototypes, I would just like to get to know you and your experience with the Va. A little bit better. How long have you been a veteran.

> P4: 2021.

Tyler: Okay, cool. And how are you interacting with the Va like, fairly, regularly these days, or.

> P4: Actually, yes, once a semester for post 9 11.

Tyler: Okay.

> P4: And then I actually started the disability process in February 2023.

> P4: Okay, so that was my 1st real experience with the va, just between me and the Va. With No one else.

> P4: Okay, the AV. Helped me. But yeah.

Tyler: Gotcha. Okay, cool. So couple of different ways, you're interacting with the Va. One of them, it sounds like was is related to your education.

Tyler: how are you usually like you said once a semester, you need to talk to the Va. About post 9, 11 benefits. How do you usually contact. The Va. In that case.

> P4: So generally that one goes through the school.

> P4: So in my experience I send the form that American university makes us send in, and then they take it straight to the VA, nothing, I mean. I don't know what the process is like on the Va. Side, but they seem pretty quick about the post 9 and 11 stuff.

> P4: Generally the the delays on that fall on the school side.

Tyler: Okay, Gotcha. So you go to like it's like a school certifying official or someone in at the school?

> P4: Yes.

Tyler: Nice. Okay, cool. What about when you're contacting the Va like more directly, do you? Do you phone the Va, or how do you usually get in touch? If you need to.

> P4: So generally, the way it worked was I would go onto the Va's website, try to find either the disability claims number or just the general number help number, and I would sometimes get a get through.

> P4: sometimes be able to talk some to somebody, and then sometimes get a number to call wasn't always the same number.

> P4: Okay.

> P4: I haven't done this in quite a bit. So I don't remember the path I go. I used to go down, but generally it was, maybe 3 phone calls and then get in delay. Answer eventually.

Tyler: Okay. And do you find that you're usually like when when you do need to contact someone, you're usually looking out for a phone number.

> P4: Generally I do. I haven't used the chat bot, except maybe once and I don't remember if I liked it or not.

Tyler: Okay, that's cool. Have you heard of something called? Ask Va.

> P4: Is that the little thing on the bottom? You just click the little. It's like a little chat room.

Tyler: It's a little bit different to that. But I can see why it sounds similar. Ask. Va is like a contact form. So it's more like, you know, when you go to a lot of websites and it says like contact us. And then you put in some information and you'll send out the form. So that's ask. Va, so it's a little different to a chat.

Tyler: Do you think you've used that before?

> P4: I think I have. I don't remember. I have. I've during that time from like February 2023 to May June timeframe. I'm trying to remember. I think I started the process. February 2023 and got an answer, January 2024,

> P4: I think I did because I tried everything on the Va website. So I might have done it.

Tyler: And this was for the disability compensation.

> P4: Yes.

Tyler: okay, cool well, we're going to talk a lot more about ask va, today, it doesn't matter whether you've used it before or not, but useful to hear a little bit more about how you've been contacting the Va. In the past. When you think about like either past experiences or how you wish it would be. What's important to you when you think about a good experience contacting the Va.

> P4: Generally it would be timeliness.

> P4: During the time that I was more upset with the Va. Was during the initial phases, when everything got submitted. And it's like, well, it's been 6 months, and I haven't gotten any update. I don't even have a contractor yet, or any of that like I just didn't know. And so it wasn't until after the whole. I guess there was a whole glitch thing in 2023

> P4: After that around December, I think I finally got an update. I finally got process for something, and that's when it became a little bit more bearable to deal with the Va but it was generally just the giant delay.

Tyler: Yeah, for sure. So like the timeliness is important. And you've had experiences where like, it can take even months to hear back from the Va. About something without an update, or whatever.

> P4: Exactly. Yeah.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. That's super helpful background. I do also want to ask you some questions about something different. So one thing we're going to talk about today is automation, just to like level set. When I'm talking about automation I'm talking about when we use computers to do something that normally a human would have to do manually, so that could be like having a helper summarize an article for you, or give you a recommendation.

Tyler: do you know, if you've ever used an online tool or a service that that used some type of automation.

> P4: Yes, my taxes.

Tyler: Okay, tell me about that. How are you using automation to help with the taxes?

> P4: It's kind of like an ask me, and it provides recommendations off keyword searches the issue I have with it is a lot of the times when you have a nuanced issue or something that doesn't exactly line up to a FAQ. Article.

> P4: You're stuck behind that FAQ article, and you go down the path to finally reach a contact us. And then you put in your information for the contact us, after 7 pages of click throughs, and it still takes 3 weeks to get an answer. So generally, that's anytime I have to go through automation or even on a phone call when you have to go through the bots to get to somebody. I think that's pretty frustrating.

Tyler: Yeah, definitely. So you can spend time like finding an FAQ, and if it doesn't work out, then you spend more time waiting and etc. What would be like? Can you describe to me a more ideal version of that process.

> P4: If I was gonna do a an FAQ. Article, you know. Keep the keyword search, keep the articles, but at the end of every article should be. If this is not it.

> P4: try this, or here's the contact information, and that's just the way I would. I would write the code.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: So you want there to be like an easy out, almost, if you've like not ended up in the right information.

> P4: Yeah, it's almost like anytime I in any scenario. If it's Verizon, if it's taxes, if it's if it's anytime, I have to go through the automated cycle

> P4: or the phone cycle or the page cycle. It's just immediately disheartening, because I know it's gonna I know what what's at the end of it.

Tyler: Okay, makes sense. And then in that scenario like, you tried to find information like you're doing your best on your own with Faqs and whatnot. And then you may need to contact someone because it's not helping. How do you feel about like making that decision? To need to contact someone like.

> P4: Well, generally it's not as bad if the contact information is there.

> P4: Things like Verizon and T-mobile. When you do that, the contact information isn't on that page. So immediately I go online, I go to Reddit is like, how do I talk to these people? And it

> P4: that's where the frustration comes in. Because, okay, this is, this would have been a great scenario if it fixed the issue I had, but it didn't, but I still can't keep going on.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P4: Kind of where the frustration lies.

Tyler: Yeah. So it needs to be like an...

Tyler: Sorry if I cut you off.

Tyler: So it needs to be like a easy bridge if there isn't an answer. 

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. When you talked a little bit about how you're using this tool to help with your taxes, it sounds like it's clear to you that like something is automated, you're putting something into the computer. And then you're getting something back. Is it always obvious when something's been automated?

> P4: I mean, I think it's a little different from my end.

> P4: Because I write python code. I put in my library search. And if that word comes up, this is what it's gonna take me to. So I kind of sort of tell I've worked as a banker before. So I know how the phone lines go. And I just

> P4: Kind of use that experience to to know how to press 0 and pound as many times as I can to get through

Tyler: Yeah.

> P4: More or less. I generally think I know, but I don't know. I don't know how to answer that one.

Tyler: No, that's a perfect answer. So obviously like, based on your experience. Especially like as a developer. It's clear to you. And you think that you generally do know when something's automated? That makes sense.

Tyler: now, thinking about like some of your interactions with the Va that you have had in the past, whether it be like when you were starting to look at the post 9 11 Gi. Bill, or maybe with disability, compensation, and filing, for that is there ways that automation could have made any of those processes easier.

> P4: That's a good question.

> P4: I think in the beginning, if there was a so I know the Va. Sends out. As soon as you put in a claim. They send out the email, saying, like, Hey, we received your claims and we'll take it in the order received.

> P4: generally I get those via mail. So they take about a week or 2. I think I've started getting them via email, which I think is good.

> P4: But I think if there was like a every 2 weeks. Hey? There's no progress. We'll update you when we get one. Even that would have been more. I mean, that's automated. Yeah. But I still think it would have been more helpful to know.

Tyler: Yeah, it's like the silence. That's the more difficult part.

> P4: I think that's where automation can maybe come in. Be like, Hey, we're still working on this. It's been assigned, but it's in the queue, or something like that.

Tyler: Yeah, definitely. So like, just more updates, even if there's not, you know, a ginormous change in like the case, or whatever you might be doing that makes sense.

Tyler: Awesome. Alright. Well, we're gonna talk more about automation and ask Va, but let's get set up with one of these prototypes. So today, we're gonna look at 3 different prototypes. There are 3 different concepts. They're gonna feel kind of similar and also different. And we're gonna use all of these to essentially start the process of sending a form through. Ask Va,

### Concept B

Tyler: So in all of these, in all 3 prototypes, you're going to be asking the Va. A question. So I'm going to send you a link in the chat on Zoom and that should just show up on your phone. Now.

> P4: Yep, and if you just open that link.

Tyler: Just let me know when you've got that open. It might take a little bit of time to load.

> P4: It is loading 2 seconds.

> P4: There we go. Okay.

Tyler: Awesome. So now that you've got that up, I'm gonna ask you to come back to zoom so that we can share your screen.

Tyler: Just let me know if you need a hand with any of that.

> P4: Do you see it now? You should see like.

Tyler: I do. Yes.

> P4: Can you see this? Now?

Tyler: Yep, that's perfect. And yeah, you can swipe my face away. Perfect. Okay?

Tyler: All right. So we're gonna start looking at this. And like, I said, this is, ask Va, we're going to start the process of sending this form before clicking on anything. Yet what would you do on this page.

> P4: Well, what I did now is probably I would probably bookmark this. But I I did.

> P4: It was just normal intuition to scroll down to see if there's a phone number at the bottom of it. And so I I as soon as it loaded up. That's the 1st thing I did, and.

> P4: There's a number, so that I like that already.

Tyler: Yeah, there's sort of that that out that we were talking about that makes sense.

> P4: And what's the purpose of this page?

> P4: Well, it looks like it is to send in a question to the Va. Looks a little old. But

> P4: yeah, it just looks like a way to start the question.

Tyler: Okay, gotcha

Tyler: so we can't type in the prototype today. So I'm just gonna have you imagine that we're typing your question so you can click in that question box.

Tyler: And this is the question that you're asking the Va. Today. So it says, what resources are available for veterans who need support with mobility or assistive devices, and I can remind you of the question as we go along. So let's say you typed in your question. Can you show me what you would do next.

> P4: That.

Tyler: Cool.

Tyler: and then we'll take a moment on this page without clicking anything, yet feel free to scroll around and tell me what this page is about.

> P4: So it looks like an automated suggestion or a

> P4: automated kind of suggestion of what we were asking.

> P4: essentially, just is, are you talking about disability? Is this related to compensations.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: so it's based on the question you asked it's giving you some sort of suggestion and like you said, it was disability in this case.

Tyler: And the question again was, you know what resources are available for veterans who need support with mobility or assistive devices? Do you think that the suggestion that it's made is a good one.

> P4: No.

> P4: In that. This is about the claims process not necessarily what resources are available. So to me, that's 2 different questions. Or, yeah, in that a list of resources is different than how do I start the claim to get into those resources? So it's a little bit more nuanced of a breakdown.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. And why do you think it might have made? Let's say, a mistake.

> P4: Well, I would say, because it's talking about assistive devices or mobility, and I think

> P4: Now, those might be the keywords.

Tyler: No.

> P4: Of course, resources might be a catch all as well, so I am no idea.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So it's using some keywords. And it might have just like, missed the mark based on the keywords. And given you the wrong suggestion.

> P4: Possibly.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So if it gave you the wrong suggestion at this point, does it matter.

> P4: Not necessarily because I would still click. Continue to see what's at the end of the trail.

Tyler: Okay. And what are you like hoping for? At the end of the trail.

> P4: Maybe a list of resources.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: okay, cool. So I kind of get the sense that even if it's wrong, you still would prefer to see what it gives you like what resources it offers before you decide that it they did put you in the wrong spot.

> P4: Generally. Yes, because if you call, you might get sent down the same path of of going through it anyway.

Tyler: Gotcha. Okay, cool. That makes sense. And then in the middle of the page here, it says, is, if this is correct, continue or try to try adding more information to your question. So what's that mean?

> P4: So to me, that would be. Maybe it's not exactly what you need. So right here you can go ahead and add more information. So maybe if I wanted a list, I would put the keyword list in there, or if I wanted

> P4: contact information for these resources, maybe I would put contact information something like that.

Tyler: Okay.

> P4: Just a question.

Tyler: Cool that makes sense. So if you made adjustments to the question, then your hope is that it will make adjustments to like what resources it offers you.

Tyler: Cool that makes sense.

Tyler: why don't we click on edit? And we'll just see what this process would be like if we were gonna edit our question. And so now we have our question here, and we can't type in this box. But if you were, gonna make an edit, you sort of described. You might add words right? You might say, like, list, is that right? Okay, cool. Why don't we click on the box as if we're typing.

Tyler: So it looks like we added a sentence. Now, it says, I need automobile adaptive equipment. So it's gotten slightly more specific. Right?

Tyler: If you wanted to continue with this more specific question, can you show me what you would do.

> P4: Okay, update.

Tyler: Okay. And now, what's this Say.

> P4: Think your questions about healthcare relates to prosthetics.

> P4: So this is better. This is good, because then I can choose. If I see I see it's going down a better, more direct path, and we're almost to where I want to get.

> P4: Oh, many. I'm trying to put myself in somebody that would need mobility issues or devices, automobile issues.

> P4: So I don't know if this is exactly correct, but I can see it's going down the path that's getting closer to where we need to be.

Tyler: So even though this is hypothetical, which makes it a little tricky. But it seems like, even with your like knowledge of this area, it's getting closer to what you, where you want to end up right.

> P4: Yes, the way I see it. It's starting very general, and it's starting to cut it down bit by bit, to become more specific. So yes.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So healthcare and relates to prosthetics feels more specific than where we were before when it said, like disability, compensation and filing claims.

> P4: Yes.

Tyler: Absolutely.

> P4: Boy.

Tyler: That makes sense. And then why is it asking? Is that correct?

> P4: Because, if you know, it might not know.

> P4: it might not know the difference between keywords, or like prosthetics and mobility devices.

> P4: are kind of related to mobility issues in general. And so that might be one way. Why, it's bringing down to this to this page. But essentially, it's just kind of training I I would assume, maybe

> P4: Or if this is the issue, I I can see a different, a few different reasons why I would ask this one, is it is this a training method for trying to see if most people that ask this question need this issue? Or is it? This is the resource?

> P4: Is this the correct resource we're providing you? Or do you need a different one? So I can see 2 different reasons for this question.

Tyler: Okay, Gotcha. So it could be like training a a model of some sort, or it could be like wanting to confirm, so that it gives you the right resources.

> P4: Yes.

Tyler: Yeah, that make both of those make sense to me. What would happen if you clicked? No, let me select my category and topic.

> P4: What would happen?

> P4: Do you want me to click it.

Tyler: I do want you to click it. But before we click, continue, what do you think is gonna happen.

> P4: So what I think is gonna happen is it's gonna light up blue. I'm gonna click it. And then hopefully, when I click, continue, it'll take me to either. Another question.

> P4: The list of topics.

> P4: That hopefully, I can click like a checkbox.

> P4: And then click, continue, or maybe just a general list for me to choose from.

Tyler: Okay, gotcha

Tyler: cool. Let's go ahead and go through and see if that's what happened, so you can click no.

Tyler: and then we'll click, continue, and then tell me about this page.

> P4: Okay.

Tyler: Is this what you expected?

> P4: yes and no. I expected a list. So I see where this is going. It's like, okay. So it's starting from the general again. So we're back to the general part, which is fine.

> P4: I was more expecting, like a like a checkbox, like click all the ones that apply instead of a select this one only.

Tyler: Okay, Gotcha.

Tyler: So

Tyler: being able to click more options, maybe that would give you more resources. Is that kind of where your head's at.

> P4: Yes.

Tyler: Cool

Tyler: that makes sense, we're gonna actually just go ahead and stop on this page you can leave your screen share because we're gonna go through another prototype in a minute. But

Tyler: I just wanna like, take a minute to think about that process. We talked about some of the things like you were expecting to happen. And maybe things that were like a little unexpected. Was there anything that you liked about the process. We just went through.

> P4: I think I enjoyed, and the phone number at the bottom the ability to go back.

> P4: And I guess the ability to kind of edit, and it

> P4: actually trying to get me to a more specific area.

Tyler: Okay?

Tyler: So you could, you could recognize that it was trying to use information. You were giving it to get you to like a more specific kind of better place. And in some ways you appreciated having to correct it.

Tyler: so was it help like, I know you had to make a correction. Was it still helpful that it offered you a suggestion? In the 1st place.

> P4: Sometimes. Yes.

> P4: sometimes it's a little frustrating. It just entirely misses the mark. But this one's okay. Wasn't.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P4: Too terrible.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. Did any part of the process feel automated.

> P4: The providing, the resource.

Tyler: Okay, providing the resource, like the part that we didn't get to yet.

> P4: No, the initial, like from the from the question to.

Tyler: Okay.

> P4: I guess page 2 would.

Tyler: Yes.

> P4: That process right? There was the automation for me.

Tyler: Okay. So it took your question, and then it used that information to give you something back. Right? Okay, cool.

Tyler: Alright. Well, we'll talk a little bit more about that at the end. But let's move on and look at the next prototype. So I'm gonna send you a link in the chat, and it should just show up for you on your phone. If you want to open that.

> P4: Okay.

Tyler: You've got that open. Okay, nice. And then if you can come back to zoom and share your screen with me, that would be helpful.

### Concept C

Tyler: perfect. Okay, so we're going to look at this next concept. I mentioned earlier that some of them are going to feel similar in certain ways. So I'm going to let you guide me through the beginning of this process again. You're asking a question to the Va.

> P4: Sure. Sure. Do you just want me to explain what I'm doing? Then.

Tyler: Yeah, that'd be perfect.

> P4: Okay, great. So 1st thing I do is I scroll down. Look, I have my out. I can. I know who to contact when this goes down again. I see it is a little bit dated, but that's okay. Coming back up, taking a look at it. I do. I am required to look at a question so and go ahead and put it in similar question.

> P4: and then I can click, continue.

Tyler: Nice, perfect, that's really helpful. Go ahead and click, continue.

Tyler: and then we've landed on this page, and I'll give you a moment to read this page.

> P4: So this page already. Is better than page 2 from the other.

> P4: Yeah, because I feel like it. It provides the same information. Of course it's it looks like it's doing more of a bigger library search and providing more resources based on that. And it doesn't just give me the one option. It's giving me quite a few options here, and if it doesn't work, it's already like, Hey. here's a way to further refine your question. Category.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: so we're liking that it's like offered you some more options, like some more resources. Here. And then it's still giving you this path where you can select a category. If you went on that path, we won't click on anything just yet. But if you were, gonna choose a category instead. What do you think would happen after you did that.

> P4: Well, if I chose the automobile adaptive equipment, I would probably either get, Probably the eligibility requirements. To see if I was eligible, maybe a little bit of how to apply to it like a apply here, or find out if you're eligible. Kind of links there and then.

> P4: Other resources like this is what's included in the equipment, whether it be like a walker or wheelchair, lifter, etc, etc. So that's kind of what I would think would be behind this link.

Tyler: Yeah. Gotcha. Okay, cool.

Tyler: So automobile adaptive equipment might provide a lot more information if you were able to click on it?

Tyler: and then, if we scroll up a little bit, what is the purpose of this select category?

> P4: And I think to me, this one right here is to further refine the questions like, maybe the library. Maybe the keywords aren't exactly in the library. Maybe it pulled up different responses to the keyword search. And so this for me, is a way to further refine the question. If these ones right here. Don't match.

Tyler: Okay, so if you like, for example, let's say all the lists the links were saying, like stuff about education, and you're like. That's not my questions about then the category. You might be able to choose something that would help direct you to closer resources.

> P4: Yes.

Tyler: Okay, gotcha, that makes sense.

Tyler: I'm just gonna take a step back here. We're in the process of submitting a question to the Va, right? So we're filling out a form that we're going to send to the Va. And

Tyler: clicking on one of these links is going to kind of take us out of that process.

Tyler: knowing yourself and what you usually do. Do you think that you would prefer to do that? To go? Take your let's say, automobile adaptive equipment sounded like up the right street? Do you think that you would click on that and continue in that direction?

> P4: If I were in this scenario. Yes.

> P4: Because even being able to read this would be faster than sending in the question to the Va and even if it, if in the end I still had to send a question in. I would know a little bit more about what I need to ask and what I need to provide, or if this even applies to me because I went down the automobile link.

Tyler: Okay? Great, yeah, that makes sense. So that's a great point, that one. It would maybe solve the problem faster or give you an answer faster. If you could find it on your own, and even if you couldn't, you would know more about this like subject that you're asking about, which could be helpful for your question.

Tyler: That makes a lot of sense.

Tyler: Were you gonna add something.

> P4: Nope.

Tyler: Okay, cool. Let's go ahead and see what this category list looks like.

> P4: Didn't mean to click that. I tried to scroll down, but.

Tyler: No, that was perfect. So tell me about what we're seeing here.

> P4: So right here. It looks like there are the categories of things that are that I don't know if this is like all of them. But it looks like this is all of the categories that we can select. To further refine our question.

Tyler: Okay?

Tyler: And so if we selected one of these like, for example, let's say we selected like pension, then we'd expect that the links on the page would maybe change.

> P4: I would. Yes.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: Okay, so let's say that your question is about healthcare we're still asking that question about mobility, mobility and assistive devices. Let's say you think that's about healthcare, so you can go ahead and choose healthcare.

Tyler: And now tell me if this page is doing what you expect.

> P4: I don't remember exactly what was on this page.

> P4: I remember this was there the automobile question. I know the cpap, I think was on there. Maybe if there was an update button.

> P4: Okay, yeah.

Tyler: Cool. So it's not really clear if it's changed like some of the links, definitely haven't changed. But maybe other links have changed. But we're it's not clear.

> P4: Yeah, cool. Yeah.

Tyler: That makes sense. Let's go ahead and continue. Let's say you wanted to continue

Tyler: and tell me about this page.

Tyler: Is this kind of what you were expecting to see? Or does this feel different.

> P4: I didn't. I was not thinking this at all.

> P4: I kind of thought it would be a leather list of resources, because we kind of go from that list of resources into.

> P4: Maybe we're in the right spot. Maybe not. Let's refine it a bit. I thought there would be more resources at the next page. Instead, it's more questions.

Tyler: Yeah, cool. I can see how that would have been like. This isn't what you expected, based on what you were telling me. So you're sort of hoping in general that you're gonna put in a question. And then the tool is, gonna try and guess what resources it might give you based on your question, and if the resources aren't right, then you could refine or help the tool. Understand your question better right? And you'd still end up with hopefully better resources at that point.

> P4: Yes.

Tyler: Okay, cool. That makes sense, and that fits with a little bit of how we felt about the last prototype we looked at as well.

Tyler: We're going to stop on this page here.

Tyler: perfect and we talked a little bit about what you were expecting versus kind of what happened in that process.

Tyler: You also mentioned that one of the things you did like was in this case. You got to see some links. So you got to see some resources with some more information that felt like, maybe more accurate for what your question was about.

Tyler: I'm going to ask you the same question again. But did you feel like any part of this process was automated.

> P4: Yes, the the initial question to providing the resources because it just automatically, you know, puts the keywords into the library, pulls out the resources that kind of from what I would code it as, and then kind of puts the the end, a predictive end to what the keyword search. And I think that's automated technically.

Tyler: Yeah, I think that makes sense.

Tyler: I'm curious. We talked about oh, shoot what was my question, it'll come back to me.

Tyler: okay, it's lost, but I'll I'm sure it'll come back to me at some point, and I'll bring it back up. Let's go ahead and look at the 3rd concept. So I'm gonna send you one more link. This will be the final prototype. We look at.

> P4: Sweet.

Tyler: And is that loading now?

> P4: It's up.

Tyler: Perfect.

> P4: Is it sharing?

Tyler: It's not sharing yet.

> P4: Then.

Tyler: Perfect. I can see it now.

Tyler: So I did just remember my question. So before we get into this prototype. we've talked a little bit about this idea of like you wanting to have an out or like a way to get help if like, you're almost reaching like a dead end. And the phone number definitely feels like, that's a way for you to feel like that.

Tyler: In the last prototype we looked at, you received like this list of links, and you also have the option to sort of like, further refine and give a choose your category and topic. Was there any out on that page, or in that process, besides calling the Va. Did you know.

> P4: So the out. Oh, yeah, yeah. Sorry.

Tyler: Okay.

> P4: The out for me is the link and so if there's resources on every page, because that means I don't have to go further. This is as deep as I need to go in the search, and I've got my answer. So even if it wasn't the right answer, knowing that it's trying to get me the answer, and get as get me out of the loop as quickly as possible.

> P4: That just in it of in of itself made me feel better than the first, which I feel is kind of where, how the view website works. So I just think that would look better.

Tyler: Yeah, cool. Okay, thanks. That's helpful. So there's either like you can call the Va or you can get a link, and you can go try and find information on your own, or like, read information on your own, and those are 2 ways of like avoiding that dead end.

> P4: Yes, and almost like if it's providing the resources there, it looks like it's trying to let me further refine it, and trying to get me out faster of the search.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense. So it's nice to have to like, know that it's attempting to like help. You almost like it's trying to get you into the right place. Yeah, cool.

### Concept A

Tyler: All right. Let's look at this 3rd prototype. Go ahead and guide me through the beginning of this process.

> P4: So this is similar to the 1st 2, you know. scroll down. We have an out to the loop before we start. Come up, and it's just a way to put in the question.

Tyler: Nice and you can go ahead and click on that question box. We have the same question. It's about mobility or assistive devices, and you can click, continue when you're ready.

Tyler: And now tell me about this page.

> P4: So to me right here. This is the... It's almost chosen a category kind of like the 1st one. but the difference is, instead of just having that category and going through the loop, it looks like we can kind of change the

> P4: the high level breakdown we're going. We're gonna go into. I would say. My initial feeling, though, is, I know that I'm going into a loop from here. It's like an automatic, because there's no out. I know I'm about to go into a loop.

Tyler: Yeah, and I know, I can get a sense for what? That loop might be from our conversation. But can you describe like the loop that you might end up in.

> P4: Yeah. So I from here I would have to choose a category, and then maybe not. Right now it's not the right one. So I already know we're starting in the wrong category. So I have to start and choose the high level category that we're gonna go down and hopefully have that category.

> P4: You know, in the level under it. And hopefully, by the end of this level, maybe 2 to 3 pages deep. I'll finally find a resource, if not, have a phone number to get out. But if that resource isn't on page 3, I'm gonna have to come back to here and start over and keep going through the loop.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: So what would be like more ideal, like the goal it sounds like for you is to end up with a list of resources. And you're giving your question, you know, to this tool and hoping that it gives you the right resources. What's the best way of getting to that.

> P4: To me. It's having. I think this is, I think, having this high level topic. Change is good. but it's having the resources there already. Because, if you know, I I know. When I asked a question in the in the automated tool. I know it's probably not going to get it right on the 1st time, but it might point me in the right direction, and having that chance that maybe it did get it right the 1st time, and all I had to do is click this link, and it saved me the time.

> P4: for me. It's just having that. That list at the beginning was a, you know, was a good thing.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: that makes sense. Okay? So you're it's not that you're you don't like that. It's like guessing wrong. It's more so that you don't like that. It's guessing wrong and not giving you like anything helpful, right? Like. It's not at least trying to give you a resource in this case, and that's a little bit. What's more frustrating? Is that right?

> P4: That's exactly it. Yes.

Tyler: Yeah, cool.

Tyler: Alright, that makes a lot of sense. The other thing I'm wondering is you compared this to that 1st prototype that we looked at. And I'm wondering this is going to test your memory a little bit. It's okay if you can't quite remember. But do you remember how this page is different to that page 2. On that 1st prototype.

> P4: Yes, I think that on page 2.

> P4: It said, we think this is connected to disability.

> P4: Is this the wrong one? Go ahead and click this link. To go into another page. Choose the right topic here. I think the difference is, is this it?

> P4: If it's wrong, you can go ahead and change the topic we're gonna go down into from this page instead of you know, you save a click, save a page which is always better.

Tyler: Okay. So this one felt faster for you to like, be able to change your category.

> P4: Yes.

Tyler: Feels faster. Okay.

Tyler: cool. Let's go through the process just to see it, but it's it might feel familiar. So we'll click on edit.

Tyler: And then you can just go ahead. Yeah. And we're seeing this list.

> P4: Probably gonna click healthcare.

Tyler: Okay, cool, and then show me what you would do next.

> P4: Yeah, okay.

> P4: So essentially, I would keep going down into the loop and choosing the path. I'm going through myself.

> P4: Which is fine, like you can see the level breakdowns here. But I know if maybe healthcare wasn't the right one, I would have to go back. But regardless I have. I have to go down this loop to get to any resource.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: that makes sense. Okay. So the loop is frustrating. And at this point you still haven't been given like a link to some information, which is, which is also like what you're hoping for.

> P4: Exactly.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

### Cool down

Tyler: alright. So let's go ahead. And we, you can stop sharing your screen or looking at the prototype, and we'll just spend the last like couple of minutes kind of reflecting on everything we just talked about.

Tyler: So I think in general, I got a really good sense, for, like what you were expecting and kind of how you were hoping for this to work, and it definitely seemed like your goal would be to end up with some information, and probably a phone number. Just in case the information didn't like work out for you.

Tyler: I think, like one thing I want to talk a little bit more about is this process when we began ask. Va is a form that you're using to fill out right to send a question to the Va.

Tyler: Did you feel like at any point you were getting towards like submitting a form, or was the goal. It's it still felt like where you were going was towards resources.

> P4: So in it. It feels like, it definitely feels like. At the end of this path there would be a way to submit a question or a form or something.

> P4: okay, probably in 2, in prototype 2. Because you see the list. And it's just it feels like we're automatically getting closer to where we're where I want to be. Cause I know at the end of this I'm going to have to ask somebody for something. But it's almost like if I'm gonna get to the right question, person, form submission faster going through this path that already has the links to go through the out but it did feel like we were getting closer to sending something to someone.

Tyler: Okay, yeah. So you could still see how like, you could maybe go off and find information on your own, or you could send something to somebody.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: that makes sense. And when we talked about these lists of categories and of topics, or basically just like ways of categorizing your question. A lot of what we focused on talking about was having the right category like knowing that it's healthcare instead of disability. Compensation is going to give you better resources. Right.

> P4: Yes.

Tyler: Is there any other reason? You think that a category like that is important? Besides giving you the right resources.

> P4: Because I think that if I know where my question lies in the grand breakdown of things I can get to my information faster.  And if someone else has that similar question, then I can tell them you need to ask the healthcare people, not the prosthetic people, or you need to go down the healthcare line instead of prosthetic one. And it's just knowing that for the next time I know how to get to this issue more quickly.

> P4: And it helps me better, I guess. Better understand how my question is categorized in the grand scheme of things.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense. So it's sort of just like you're becoming more familiar with, like the subject area, and probably like how the Va works, which is like, only gonna be beneficial. As you go down like whatever route that you that you need to go.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: Cool. That makes sense.

Tyler: okay, I'm going to ask you a completely left field question, are you familiar with the term data model?

> P4: I feel like I do. I just went down a AI path on my flight back to [Location]. So maybe.

Tyler: Okay, cool. Well, you don't need to be familiar with it, but I'm curious. If we had said that any of the prototypes you looked at. Today, we're using a data model. What would that mean to you?

> P4: To me it would mean that after a bunch of going down similar questions, similar paths of similar keywords that generally people found the this resource that is provided for. This keyword is generally where the standard, like bell curve. Totally forgot what it was. This is generally where they go, or to me generally, where they close the page or enter their search not necessarily the right page, but generally where the search ended.

Tyler: Okay, Gotcha. So I think that's useful, like, you're sort of relating it to other people's similar questions is kind of like how the data model comes in. Yeah, that makes sense. 

Tyler: This isn't ever about getting anything right or wrong. But that is that is sort of correct. And how we're thinking about the data model. But I think we're trying to get a sense. For like, whether people need to know that it's a quote, unquote data model, or that's not. That's not useful information to the average person.

Tyler: Okay, cool. I think I'm all set with my questions. We've got a couple of extra minutes. If you have any questions for for myself or the team.

> P4: No, this is so cool.

> P4: That was really cool, because it's like, I know, like I've done one of these before. And it's like, Oh, this is really cool, really fascinating, that it's actually being put to use. Unlike mine. Mine's just for fun.

> P4: but I think I guess my only the suggestion is something of really subjective feeling. And the breakdown between.

> P4: Internally, I feel as soon as I clicked on Prototype B and prototype A. I immediately get the negative sense of, I'm gonna have to go down a loop. And it was just having that prototype C, even though the 3rd page or 4th page wasn't exactly what I thought it would be. It's knowing that it tried, and that. Having the, you know, positive language like generally, this might be helpful, but let us know this is wrong. Even that made it a little bit more positive than B or A.

Tyler: Yeah, totally. I think that like sort of subjective feeling is really useful and like a big reason for us to do research with folks, and I think

Tyler: I'm getting the sense from other veterans as well that that is helpful, like I think there's a really big distinction. I'm seeing a lot of people be frustrated by the suggestion when it's wrong. So, for example, when it says disability, compensation, I'm seeing a lot of people frustrated at that. But if it makes the suggestion that's wrong, and it's like resources or links, and it's trying to give you information, it's like slightly less frustrating. So I think that's like something for us to think more closely about, just ways to show that, like, we're trying our best to get you to the right information without you having to wait a really long time to get to that place.

> P4: Yes. Yes.

Tyler: Awesome. Well, thanks so much for your time, [P4]. I hope you still have time for some lunch on your lunch break. But yeah, it's been really helpful to learn from you. If you have any questions to follow up, you can reach out to Shannon. She's the one who set up the session, and she'll also give you some information. You can pass on to other veterans if they want to participate in the future as well.

> P4: Thank you, Tyler, and thank you. Everyone else.

Tyler: Thanks, [P4], have a good day.

> P4: Bye-bye.

Tyler: Bye.
