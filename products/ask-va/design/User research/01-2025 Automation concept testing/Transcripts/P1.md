Tyler: All right, so the recording started. I just want to confirm one more time you're comfortable if I record today.

> P1: Yes.

Tyler: Okay, awesome. Thank you, [P1]. So that was a lot of information. Is there any questions you have for me at this point?

> P1: I don't think so.

Tyler: Okay. Well, let's go ahead and get started. Before we look at some prototypes, I do want to just learn a little bit more about you and your experience with the VA. How long have you been a veteran?

> P1: Well, I guess I've been a veteran since 1970.

Tyler: Okay. So a couple of years now.

> P1: Yeah. More than two.

Tyler: Did you start interacting with the VA back in the 70s or more in the last like 20 years?

> P1: Actually, in the 70s. Yeah, I filed a claim. Mm-hmm. So glad that I did. And it was… I didn't use the VA. I just filed a claim.

Tyler: Okay.

> P1: It was a small thing, but… I really started to use the VA probably about six, seven years ago eight years ago

Tyler: Okay. How do you often like interact with the VA these days. Is it usually for your health care?

> P1: 100% healthcare. They're my PCP.

Tyler: Okay. Gotcha.

Tyler: And do you contact the VA? I think you mentioned that you sometimes contact your doctors online. Is that right?

> P1: Yes. Yes.

Tyler: Mm-hmm. So are you usually contacting your doctors online using like secure messaging are there or do you call? Is there any other way you contact the VA?

> P1: All of the above. Sometimes if I'm down there even, I can, you know. You know go knock on the door, give me a call saying, I'm out here. Just talk to me for a second, whatever.

Tyler: Okay, gotcha. I'm curious what your preference is for getting in touch with anyone at the VA, but primarily your doctors, it sounds like.

> P1: It depends on the severity of the question. I mean, that call might be the next day. Secure messaging. May be the same the next day. But typically, if It depends on anything that's severe or there.

Tyler: Okay. So if it's more urgent, is that what you mean?

> P1: Absolutely. Mm-hmm. Now, if it's real urgent, there's that triage number you can call. That's kind of funny because all they tell you is go to the ER.

Tyler: Mm-hmm.

> P1: That's, you know, to cover their butts there so.

Tyler: Have you ever used the VA's chat bot or ever heard of it?

> P1: I've seen it pop up. I have seen that.

> P1: I've seen, I think, something about that i've never used it. It's fairly new isn't it?

Tyler: It is fairly new, yeah. And there's also something called Ask VA. Have you heard of Ask VA?

> P1: No.

Tyler: Okay, cool. That's totally fine. And one more question I have about contacting the VA. So we talked about how like you're often making your decision on like how to contact the VA, like which channel based on like severity or urgency.

Tyler: When you think about a good experience contacting the VA, what do you think is like the most important thing to you?

> P1: Mm-hmm. Response.
 
Tyler: Yeah, tell me more about that.

> P1: Well, it's important because I don't I wouldn't call the VA for an ingrown toenail. But if I'm getting sick. Or something drastic i mean you know I don't cry wolf when i i When I cry, it's a necessity.

> P1: And I truly appreciate that quick response. And for the most part, I get a quick response.

Tyler: So you think the like the speed or like the timeliness of the response is probably the most important thing.

> P1: Absolutely.

Tyler: Yeah, that's really helpful. That makes a lot of sense. And I think, go ahead.

> P1: My PCP, who's a pa has a nurse and i've had a nurse Through the years, I've had different RNs you know The one I have now is just super fantastic. I mean, she is so caring Just fantastic. I couldn't ask for a better person.

Tyler: Awesome.

> P1: If I come to the lobby to keep her there and not let her go anywhere.

Tyler: Yeah, well, that's awesome. I love to hear that. So [P1], we're going to talk a little bit more about this, especially as we look at the prototypes. But I also want to ask you a couple questions about something different.

Tyler: One thing that we're going to talk about a little bit today is automation. So when I say automation, I'm talking about when we use computers to do work that people normally have to do manually. So like having a helper who can summarize an article for you or give you a recommendation.

Tyler: Do you know if you've ever used an online tool or a service that uses some type of automation?

> P1: Oh, I have them on my computer that… where it helps you write or correct your it's spell check.

Tyler: Yeah. Yeah, that's a great example. Yeah, so spell check is an example that's probably been around for a while now.

> P1: Yeah. A long time. But also, what's the one that now comes up? I forget the uh I don't know, it's a little green circle.

Tyler: Okay. And what does that one do?

> P1: It'll take your sentences. Put them into a better format.

Tyler: Okay, gotcha. Is it maybe it's Grammarly? Okay cool yeah that's a great example as well.

> P1: That's it. Little green G. Yeah.

Tyler: Yeah, perfect. So that's an example of like a tool that you're using that's sort of like doing some automatic process to make something easier for you. In this case, writing a better sentence. That's really helpful. And it sounds like when that happens, you can see the green circle. It's a fairly obvious thing that that's happening. Do you think you can always tell when something is automated?

> P1: Mm-hmm.

> P1: Never thought about but probably i would think yes but that's probably not not the truth. I mean, a lot happens in the background you can't Yes.

Tyler: Yeah, yeah, for sure. Do you think if something was happening in the background that was like some sort of automation that was maybe like making something go faster or making something happened for you, it's important for you to know that that's happening or it might not matter if you don't know.

> P1: It might not matter, but you don't know if it's helping you or hurting you.

Tyler: Yeah. Okay. Cool. And I know these questions are really hypothetical and we'll get a chance to talk about them in a more like tangibly.

> P1: Thomas, are you still awake?

Tyler: Thomas is usually pretty good at staying awake on calls, but we'll see.

> P1: We don't know because he's quiet.

Tyler: True. He does have that going for him. What about like any hesitations or concerns? I know we you're probably hearing more about automation or particularly like artificial intelligence more these days. Do you have any hesitations or concerns when it comes to those things?

> P1: Actually, I'm a believer in AI. I've been in banking for many years. I was a lender and I was a pretty good lender, you know. But I found out that even as a well seasoned lender. I still have prejudices. And not that I would prejudice against things that are out are not legal. It's just natural prejudices. And that sometimes clouded my best vision. Although my record's really, really good. But I found, I went through a test with the bank. And… I made decisions. And then the AI made the decisions and at the end, they beat me. And they beat me not by much, but they still beat me. When I say natural prejudice, you know, when I was a military veteran I always had prejudice for them.

Tyler: Yeah. I think that's really that's such a useful example in a way of kind of I guess accepting like ways that artificial intelligence or automation like could be good at doing things that we also might think we're quite good at as well. And bias is a really good example of where that might come into play.

> P1: Yeah, yeah. I didn't care if you were a veteran or a veteran or whatever it was strictly on However… to just end up for my thoughts there. If you've been in the military At least we know you understand the chain of command. You take orders and carries on life. I hired as many veterans as I could. You know, trusted okay good one.

Tyler: Yeah, no, that makes sense. And I guess now that makes me think if you were thinking about like ways you interact with the VA, is there any way you could think that like automation could make things easier?

> P1: Oh, yeah, just a quick example. You know, we used to be able to go to a kiosk You got that story, right? Punch in our travel pay Now we have to sit down and fill out a form. Stick it in a box. They have to do this. Everybody crumbles about that. I see no reason why that can't be brought back in some form. Are you aware of that?

Tyler:  Yeah, I've heard about this. I haven't worked on travel pay, but I do hear complaints about submitting the requests. What made it easier using the kiosk?

> P1: You're right there. You're checking in and you just push the buttons. It prompted you. You did it and you finished. Now you have, when you go to the VA, you have to sit down fill out a form. It's a very redundant form. And have you seen them? You know what they are?

Tyler: I don't know a lot about them, no.

> P1: Do you see that? Paperform, yeah.

Tyler: Yeah, okay. So it's a paper form. And it looks and you're saying that it's also fairly redundant, like there's quite a few fields for you to fill in.

> P1: Yeah. But at the kiosk, you just hit the buttons. It was done.

Tyler: Okay, yeah, that makes sense. So it's…

> P1: As far as going online. I consider myself to be a semi-intelligent human being. And in straight English, going to that website kicks my ass. I don't do it anymore.

Tyler: Okay. Yeah. Do you think, is there any reason in particular like is it that there's too much writing or it's hard to find things? Is there anything in particular?

> P1: Yeah, it's… you have to sign in and then you have to go to that that site whatever it is, OTCB or whatever And you got to look, you know, get the password. And everybody has so many passwords and you have to take your cheat book and look it up to see what it is.

> P1: Then you have to go And see what the appointment is. If the appointment isn't there, you have to file. So yeah, it's a pain in the butt.

> P1: So when they do things like when they do things like that. Same thing with sign on. I used to just go to my healthy vet, boom, boom, boom, I'm there. Now I have… with the secondary and they take if you have your phone with you, you're out of luck. I understand you're trying to keep it. Has anybody really hack into those things?

Tyler: Yeah. Yeah, it's definitely tricky. And I hear a lot of complaints about the sign in process so unfortunately, you're not alone with finding it quite frustrating compared to the old My Healthy Vet process.

Tyler:[P1], I'm going to shift gears a little bit because I see the time and the next thing we're going to do is start looking at some of these prototypes together.

Tyler: So I'm going to send you a link in the chat on Zoom. So I'll just send that right now And if you navigate to the chat, let me know if you have any issues finding the chat.

Tyler: You should see a fairly long link. That you can open up you see.

> P1: It disappeared.

Tyler: All right. Maybe you saw the, it like kind of pops up. So if you go to the bottom of the Zoom screen where you can see my face, where you found that mute button.

> P1: Mm-hmm.

> P1: Oh, okay. I see it. It was not. Got it. There's the whole length.

Tyler: And you go along that bottom, it'll say chat somewhere. You see it? Okay. And then if you open that up, you should be able to see Perfect. So then… Yes. Awesome. So if you click on that link. It should start to open up.

Tyler: And then what you can do while that's loading is you can come back to the Zoom window where you see my face. And I'm going to ask you to share your screen.

Tyler: You're back with me? Okay, cool. So now share. Yeah, if you click share, perfect.

> P1: Yes. Sure. It's here.

Tyler: Okay, awesome. So it looks like it's loading. Perfect. So I can see it says cribbage Classic. And then behind that window, perfect. I can see Zoom. And then it looks like your next tab I think that's the window. That window you just closed, I think we might want that one open.

Tyler: If you can find the Yeah, perfect. Yeah, that's perfect. So if you go to that second tab. So where it says AVA. So if you, yeah, perfect. And we'll click on that.

Tyler: Awesome. Okay. So, and you don't need to worry about signing in.

> P1: I'll get out of there.

Tyler: Yeah, you can just X out. Perfect. Okay. Cool. So we're all set up. Like I said, it looks a little funny because it thinks you're on your phone.

> P1: It's huge.

Tyler: Okay, well, hopefully it's huge in the right way. Let me tell you a little bit about what we're doing. So we're on va.gov.

Tyler: And this is a tool called Ask VA that I mentioned earlier. So Ask VA is a form that you can use to ask the VA a question. Your question could be about education. It could be about disability compensation.

Tyler: It might be about health care. And I'm going to show you a couple different concepts. So we're going to look at three different ideas and all three of these concepts you're asking the VA a question.

Tyler: Do you have any questions about that, about what we're going to do?

### Concept A

> P1: Hopefully they're not very important. They're not be very important you're going to get in seven business days.

Tyler: Yeah, I figured. I thought maybe you might notice that right away because I know you talked about how timeliness is important.

Tyler: That's really helpful feedback. So automatically we're noticing it's going to take seven business days. Hopefully your question is not important because that's way too long to wait.

Tyler: Which is helpful feedback. Okay, so let's look at this concept The first thing we're going to do is without clicking on anything, can you tell me what you would do on this page? And you can scroll if you put your mouse over the phone.

Tyler: You're able to scroll. Yeah, perfect. So just let me know what would you do on this page?

> P1: Type in my question.

Tyler: Type in your question. Okay, cool. That felt pretty straightforward. So what we can't do in this prototype is we can't actually type. So what we'll do is we'll have you just click in the question box and we're going to pretend like you typed in this question.

Tyler: Perfect. Your question is what resources are available for veterans who need support with mobility or assistive devices?

Tyler: Okay. And I can remind you of the question as we go along.

Tyler: This is the question you're asking the VA. What would you do next after you typed in your question?

> P1: Continue.

Tyler: Okay, let's click continue. All right. And then let's take a moment to read through this page.

> P1: I'm going to scroll down.

Tyler: Yeah, you can scroll down. Perfect. Without clicking anything yet, can you tell me about this page? What is this page about?

> P1: Well, if I'm a disability compensation the question I think it was about compensation.

Tyler: Yeah, why do you think it says disability compensation? Why is that?

> P1: Well, I guess they're assuming that if you're asking about that you have a disability compensation started.

> P1: I would that that would that would I didn't expect that.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. So what you're, if I'm understanding correctly, it took your question and it said. Based on your question, we think you have disability compensation and that's why we're going to suggest this, but to you, it's surprising. Like this doesn't really relate to disability compensation. What do you think it might relate to?

> P1: Let me choose that, don't [guess for me].

Tyler: You'd rather choose it. Yeah. Why do you think that you would rather choose it? Tell me more about that.

> P1: Well… Let me go back to the quick, can I go back to the question?

Tyler: I think so. Let's see. Let's try and scroll down and click back. I don't know if it will… work.

> P1: Can't take me back.

Tyler: Okay. Yeah. So I can tell you the question though. The question was, what resources are available for Veterans who need support with mobility or assistive devices. What do you think that relates to?

> P1: Well, when you reread that. I guess it does make sense that we bring up disability compensation. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I think that's completely fair. But to me, that's still misleading.

Tyler: Yeah. So why do you think that... Why is there even like a category in the first place? Like, why is it saying your category disability compensation? What is this for?

> P1: Well, those of us who have disability compensation probably have questions about devices Or who do you talk to about exploring a device. So it's kind of thrown you right into that trough, I don't, again, I think that's presumptive.

Tyler: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. That makes sense. And I saw your mouse was kind of hovering over the edit button What do you think that that would do?

> P1: Yeah. It might give me a chance to change that disability compensation. But yeah, compensation.

Tyler: Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. Would you be able to like type in something in its place or what do you think you'd be able to do if you click to edit.

> P1: I would hope it would give me… either a definition of what they're thinking or given the opportunity to give me the opportunity investigate that more.

Tyler: Gotcha. Okay. So maybe if it said like why it was telling you disability compensation, it would make more sense. Or you might want to change it. Yeah, cool. Let's click.

> P1: But there again, that's chasing me around the barn you know Open up the door and let me in.

Tyler: Yeah. What would you prefer in this process? You did say earlier, like, just let me choose. Do you think that would be faster? Like you just get to choose from a list?

> P1: Yes, yes. My analogy to this is… make the phone call. If you want this, press one. If you want this, press two. All the way down to number nine and then press pound key for repeat. I don't want to go through that.

Tyler: Okay gotcha. Yeah. So let's click edit. Let's click on edit and see what happens.

> P1: Here's my drop. Can I drop down?

Tyler: Yeah, let's click on that. So this might work a little bit funny in the prototype but Yeah, you should be able to scroll hopefully.

Tyler: So is this kind of what you were hoping to start with was just a list like this?

> P1: Yes.

Tyler: Okay. Is there any option you think fits better?

> P1: That could be one right there. Decision reviews and appeals okay. And if it's helpful, your question was about support with mobility or assistive devices. If you're traveling, this could be an issue right here. Benefits issues outside the U.S. That's a wide range there.

Tyler: It is a wide range. Does this list feel like it's easy to make a decision?

> P1: See, I don't think that's... My thoughts back to the question were. I need a shower seat. Okay. How can I get a shower seat?

Tyler: Right. Okay.

> P1: And I don't see that in here. There's a health care.

Tyler: Yeah. So maybe healthcare, maybe decision reviews and appeals, but it's not obvious. It's not super easy to make a decision because you're missing. It's kind of missing what you're expecting to be in the list, right?

> P1: No, no. So if I go to healthcare, then it might give you another drop-down list And now I'm going through the phone prompts.

Tyler: Yeah. Right, which we don't like.

> P1: So let me go back to the question. In my opinion, let's go back to the question. What do you want... Help me find… someone who can get me a shower chair.

Tyler: Yeah. Yeah, makes sense. Okay.

> P1: Let AI take me to the AI. Proper place.

Tyler: Okay. So it almost feels like all of this choosing process shouldn't have to happen in some ways. Is that right? Okay. Okay. So let's… Oh, go ahead.

> P1: Yes, yes, absolutely. Now, I also understand that not everyone thinks the same.

> P1: And… I'm going to say this. Military way was… repetitive, repetitive, repetitive. For training. And we're not all on the same page with capabilities. So dumber than others.

Tyler: Yeah, and that's fair. Which was also one of the reasons we do research with a lot of people.

> P1: Sounds good to me.

Tyler: Okay, so I'm this is… This has been really helpful so far. I'm going to have you click on healthcare And we'll just say that this is what you decided to go forward with. And then hopefully you can scroll up a little bit.

Tyler: Yeah, perfect. And then why don't we save that. Okay, so what does it look like has happened now?

> P1: Okay. It tells me now that At least I don't have to go back too far to get back to the spot. I like that.

Tyler: Okay. Okay, so you can see the change has been made and It was fairly simple once you made a decision.

> P1: Right now, on my own, I'd probably go to edit and see what that says.

Tyler: Okay.

> P1: It didn't work.

> P1: Okay. You'd think, let me click on edit again.

Tyler: I don't know if it's going to let you, but… That's just because it's, yeah, it's a prototype. So what would you think would what would you hope would happen if you clicked on edit.

> P1: I guess. Give me more options. Try to pare that down so that I could be where I wanted. I mean, health, you know. That's so broad.

Tyler: Gotcha.

> P1: Healthcare. Health care. If I was looking for a shower chair, then I would be going to the… Yeah. Can't think of the name of it now. Physical therapy area. That's who handles that.

Tyler: Okay. Yeah. Okay, gotcha. So you're thinking maybe if you clicked on edit, you would get to like narrow it down further, kind of like the phone triage system. Like it's like, okay, if it's healthcare within healthcare, would it be this area or whatever? That's helpful.

Tyler: Let's click on continue. And then tell me about what we're seeing on this page.

> P1: That's far out. Vet Centers.

Tyler: You don't really like the suggestion, right?

> P1: Vet centers and readjustment counseling. I mean, once his vet center, am I going to try to find one? Or looking for readjustment counseling that's two spectrums there.

Tyler: Yeah. Okay. So you don't like the suggestion. Does this feel like, is vet centers and readjustment counseling something related to healthcare?

> P1: No. Well, yes, it would be. But I'm trying to pare it down to where i want to go Just take me out to.. Just back out into this back out the prompt.

Tyler: Gotcha. Okay. So you feel like you're like trying to make it more specific. You're trying to like help the VA understand what you're asking about and it's not giving you the options that you need.

> P1: I'm circling the airfield here.

Tyler: Yeah, makes sense. Okay, so let's stop here on this concept. So you can leave this open on your computer but um I just want to kind of like summarize our thoughts on the concept. Was there anything that you liked about

Tyler: This process that you just went through.

> P1: Well. I think it's easy to see, but it was confusing. Yeah. Yeah. Confusing to me.

Tyler: And when you say easy to see, are you talking like literally like it was visible on the page?

> P1: I mean, they come up fast it's there.

> P1: I guess I think… like the church here, but I think the pews are wrong.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense. So the detail and like the actual content is like. Not making sense or confusing or it almost was like a little frustrating But you can figure out where to click and you can read the text and that part of the website is working.

> P1: Yes, yes.

Tyler: Yeah, okay, cool. 

Tyler: Did it feel like any part of this process was automated?

> P1: Oh, absolutely. Sure.

Tyler: Okay. Tell me about which part.

> P1: When I ask the question, it's just, boom, we're going here. You know? I didn't want to go there. I think we talked about that.

Tyler: Okay. And was that helpful or not helpful?

> P1: Took me where I didn't want to go.

Tyler: Yeah. Yeah. So in this case, the automation wasn't helpful because it actually took you in the wrong direction and it felt like you were having to like correct it.

> P1: Yes. The automation is going to look at the broad spectrum.

> P1: Well, you know. Talk to me.

### Concept B

Tyler: That makes sense. That's really helpful. And I know you're going to have to repeat yourself through this next like through this hour we have together. So I really appreciate your patience with me. But that was really helpful feedback. And I think it's time for us to look at our next concept. So you can keep sharing your screen. And what I'm going to do is send you a link in the Zoom chat. So if you come back to Zoom.

> P1: Get out of here. Get out of here.

Tyler: Yeah, you can X that out. That's fine, yeah. And then we're going to have to open another link. So you're going to have to come back and find my face.

> P1: Okay.

Tyler: Which now that you're sharing your screen is a little bit different. Let me think. Do you see like a zoom a zoom like application at the bottom of your screen.

> P1: Yes, I can see it now. So where it says ZM, it's like a blue bubble.

Tyler: Yes. And then if we click on that, I think maybe If you click on screen sharing, like that green and red on the right side, let's try and click on that. And then does that show up like a bar in the middle of your screen?

> P1: I hear it. You are screen sharing.

Tyler: And then maybe you can find something that says chat. Is that… Mm-hmm. Green at the top of the…

Tyler: Tell me what you're seeing on the screen sharing like message.

Tyler: Are there any like just a green bar.

> P1: I don't have, she has a little… green bar red bar you know That's… Okay, okay. It dropped down.

> P1: Oh, okay. All right. Sorry. This is a little confusing. So what we'll do Drop down.

> P1: Yeah. Chat? No. Chat.

Tyler: Perfect. Chat. Perfect. Yes, chat.

Tyler: There it is. Okay, now I have it. New message. Concept.

Tyler: Perfect. Okay. Thank you. Now we've got the second concept opened and this will probably go a little You don't have to sign in. That's correct. Yeah, you can X that out.

> P1: I don't want to sign it right.

Tyler: This is going to look pretty similar to begin with. So we might go a little faster. So on this first page, you can scroll down a little bit.

> P1: Yes.

> P1: Yep. Click on that.

Tyler: This looks familiar, right? Okay, so you can go, yeah, perfect. Click on that box and your question is going to be the same question. It's what resources are available for veterans who need support with mobility or assistive devices.

Tyler: And so show me what you would do next.

> P1: Continue.

Tyler: Oh, uh-oh, it looks like we have the same concept open.

Tyler: That's my fault. Maybe we need to find the Zoom chat again.

Tyler: So if it's possible for you to find that bar at the middle kind of top of your screen. Where you clicked on chat. Are you seeing that? And then… Do you see the chat there?

> P1: Yes. Nothing's… Yeah, it's not a highlight.

Tyler: Okay. Yeah. So once we have the chat open, there's two links in the chat. And let's try and click on that second link that I sent At 9.38. Or at 38 past the hour. You got it? Okay, thank you. Sorry about that.

> P1: Okay, gotcha.

> P1: That's your one mistake. For the day. LOL.

Tyler: LOL. Thank you. Okay, so we've got this one open. We'll do the same thing with the question. So you can go ahead and click on the question and then we'll go ahead and continue when you're ready Okay.

> P1: Thank you. Processing your question.

Tyler: Okay, so what was happening just now? You said it was processing?

> P1: No, I have a… Can't you see it? Okay.

Tyler: I can see it. Yeah. I just wanted you to describe it to me.

> P1: Similar questions, okay. Your question about disability compensation relates to how to file a claim.

> P1: It's assuming that I want to file a claim. And all I wanted to do was get a shower chair.

Tyler: Okay. Yeah. Gotcha. And how did it make that assumption? Why did it make that assumption that it's about disability compensation and relates to filing?

> P1: Sure, it's because, as I said, many other veterans have asked the question. So it's a broad spectrum. Of you know percentage maybe 60, 70, 80%. Are directed to that. But it shouldn't assume that that's what I want.

Tyler: Okay. So we're still like similar to last time, we're still finding it frustrating that it made an assumption.

> P1: Yes, yes. Yes.

Tyler: Yeah. Makes sense.

> P1: So I would hope that from here I can go back to edit my question, say. Let me talk to someone who can get me a shower chair.

Tyler: Okay, so you try and maybe like make your question more specific so that it would make a better assumption. Okay, gotcha. You can go ahead and click on that. I can see you're hovering over the edit. And then you might just need to scroll down a little bit.

Tyler: So what's happening now? It looks like this is your question.

Tyler: What would you do in here? Would you like delete your question and write the shower head question or would you write the shower seat? Okay. You would try and completely edit the question.

> P1: Yes. I'm paring down right now.

Tyler: Okay, I gotcha. And would you not decide to like add to this? You would rather like replace it with a more specific question?

> P1: Yes.

Tyler: Okay, gotcha. That's really helpful. So we can't type in the prototype just like before. So you're just going to have to click on that question box.

Tyler: And it's going to add some more text. I know that's not what you would do. You would like end up deleting it and writing in a more specific question, which is helpful for us to know. But let's assume that's what happened. And then you can go ahead and continue from here. So what would you click on next?

> P1: Cancel. Yeah.

Tyler: You'd cancel. Why is that?

> P1: I don't want an update. This is going down the wrong road.

Tyler: Okay, what do you think update means?

> P1: Probably give me give me directly to someone who could answer this question.

Tyler: Hmm. Okay. And that's not the question you had. Is that what you mean? 

> P1: So this is I mean, this financial assistance or coverage not you're talking about high dollar things here. And at this point give one more chance. I'd get in the car to go down to CVS and buy one.

Tyler: Okay, okay. I see. So one thing that's really tricky here, [P1], is like, I know you didn't get a chance to actually write your question. And so you're kind of having to use the question that we wrote for you.

> P1: Right.

Tyler: Which does make it tricky. So let's click update. What we're going to do is pretend like you've updated this question in a way that like better fit you. I know that's not exactly what happened.

> P1: I'll get back in the game here, coach. LOL.

Tyler: LOL. And then tell me what happened now after you clicked update. What's it telling you on this page?

> P1: Well, it's saying if we're still wrong Here's your chance to correct it.

Tyler: Okay. What do you think about that? The fact that it said it it's giving you the chance to correct it.

> P1: Finally, finally.

Tyler: Okay. Yeah.

Tyler: I think I get the same sense as the last concept where you're just like, it honestly would have been easier if I just got to choose.

> P1: Mm-hmm.

Tyler: Okay. You can click on no. I can see you're ready to click and then go ahead and click continue.

> P1: I like that cursor. That's easy to see.

Tyler: Okay, that's good. And then what is this list here? Is it easy to make a decision based on this list?

> P1: Like of these things. No, it's not. Okay. No. We're right back to the… Back to the prompt, press 1, press 2, press 3.

Tyler: Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

> P1: It just looped me right back through.

> P1: So similar frustration. Yesterday, I tried to find an answer. Through my supplemental. I went through seven people. With the same authentication, the same question and then okay And finally, I just hung up. I quit. At this point, I would quit. Really?

Tyler: Yeah. Yeah. Makes sense. I can see why. I can see how this is frustrating that like.

Tyler: You're having to make decisions First, it's giving you a recommendation that you don't agree with and then you're having to make a decision And it feels like something's missing from the list that you're looking for. So it's hard for you to choose the right option.

> P1: If you'll assume, you know, don't assume. You know what that means, right?

Tyler: Yeah. Yeah, I do. Okay.

> P1: Okay.

Tyler: Let me ask you one more question and then we're going to move on. Of this list, we've got six options in this list. If there was like an other Do you think that's what you would choose?

> P1: Absolutely. [I would choose 'Other.]

Tyler: Okay, so it doesn't feel like it's any of these options and it would be other.

> P1: Yes.

Tyler: Yeah, gotcha. Okay. That's helpful. All right, [P1], we've got one more prototype to look at together.

### Concept C

Tyler: So we're going to have to go back to the If you can find the chat. And then I'm gonna, yeah, you can X out of that.

> P1: X out of this.

Tyler: And I'm going to send you a third link. So I just sent you one more link in the chat.

> P1: I'll go down to the bottom this time.

Tyler: Perfect. And we'll open this one up.

Tyler: Okay, awesome. So this one starts the same way. So you can go ahead and take us through this part of the process.

> P1: Okay.

Tyler: Perfect. And now tell me what's happening on this next page.

> P1: Okay, gives you the opportunity. To find out more about your eligibility. It tells you about secure messaging. Order drinks now that one See, ordering medical supplies, that's only if you're already into the system like my batteries.

Tyler: Okay. Yeah. So it's still not what you're looking for.

> P1: That doesn't make the grade. No.

Tyler: Yeah. What described to me in like a couple of words what you would look for something that says blank.

> P1: Tyler, I'm Italian. I can't say anything in two words.

Tyler: LOL. You can say it in a couple more than two words.

> P1: I hear you laughing, Thomas. Okay.

Tyler: Like, for example, order medical supplies that one link that says order medical supplies, that feels kind of like what some of the things you've been talking about. But it doesn't feel exactly right. I'm curious why that is.

> P1: Yeah. Yeah, it's the closest, but it's a little off. No, it's not. That's probably the closest thing. Yeah, I guess. Looking at this, you can't order it Because it's a one-time thing. Is order medical supplies. These are things that you're already in. Like supplies for supplies It depends if you need them or if you're hearing aid batteries that's already established line.

> P1: To go to use secure messaging and then go and go to your PCP. So if I had nothing else or no other people I could talk to, I would say as a rookie, I'd go here. Messaging and go to my PCP. You have a nurse as good as mine who could then help you out. So this was not dead end.

> P1: For a knowledgeable person. But take a rookie here. They wouldn't know that. That was more than two words.

Tyler: No, that's perfect. So it feels like… you know that you could choose secure messaging so that you have someone to ask their question to.

Tyler: And then ordering medical supplies is close to what you're looking for, but that's more like you have like an established, like I regularly order hearing batteries. This is how I do it.

> P1: Yeah.

> P1: I don't think it's close. I don't even think it's close because that's a different What do you got?

Tyler: Okay. Gotcha. Okay. And so how has it made these recommendations? Like it's giving you these like four links. What helped them decide which four links to give you or is it just random?

> P1: Well, I think it's random. No, I don't think it's random at all.

Tyler: You don't think it's random? Okay. Okay.

> P1: I mean, I can see why they're presenting these. Because it's close, but its close broad spectrum is close. But it's not even close.

Tyler: Okay, I see. So based on your question, you can see why they might have given you these four links and they're close, but they're not what you're looking for.

> P1: Absolutely.

Tyler: So… Yeah. If that happened, like let's say you ask this question, you get these four links, they're getting close, but they're not exactly what you're looking for. What do you think you would do next? What would you in an ideal world, we won't even click on the prototype. Just tell me what you might do.

> P1: I probably put a call into my PCP. Secure messaging or even a phone call. And say, look, you know. Who could I talk to? I need to talk to somebody. Physical therapy. Just tell them what I want. We'll tell them what I need. I think I need. Cut to the chase, make it simple.

Tyler: Okay, gotcha. One thing I'm curious about is like, would it be helpful like Obviously, I can see why, especially as you're frustrated with this tool, you would be like, let me just call my PCP.

Tyler: But let's say we were like using the tool and you asked the question and it gave you these four links and it said.

Tyler: This is what we think you're asking about. Would you then want to say, oh, no, sorry, actually, I'm asking about this. Like, let me explain more to you and you can try and give me a better guess or would you be like you're not guessing well. I'm kind of done with this tool.

> P1: I'd give it one more try. I'll give one more try and then I'd say, screw it.

Tyler: That makes sense. Okay, cool.

### Cool down

Tyler: Let's go ahead and wrap up. We've got like about five minutes left.

Tyler: And so, [P1], you're welcome to click like stop sharing that red button that's on your screen. And then we can just chat for the last couple minutes.

Tyler: Okay, so we looked at three ideas All three of the ideas provide some sort of suggestion to you. I know that none of them worked super well for you. And that's really helpful feedback.

Tyler: Out of the three, did you prefer when you were suggested what your question was about? So you were suggested like a category or did you prefer being suggested helpful links that might relate to your question.

> P1: I'd rather go right straight. Give me a better question or define your question. If you go to another link It's just another step in the process.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. Then you have to like jump away and do a whole other thing.

Tyler: I almost kind of like feel like, because what we're trying to do here is We're trying to use someone's question that they're asking to figure out which department should answer the question. Do you think that that was obvious in any of those processes?

> P1: Oh, absolutely.

Tyler: Okay.

> P1: Our needs are so diverse. You can't put it all in one bucket. And that's what we're trying to do.

Tyler: Yeah. What do you think? Is there a way that it would be better to do this. Like I know at the beginning it felt like it would be better for you to just choose yourself which option. But then once you were trying to choose, you were like, I don't really like the options it's giving me. Do you think that there's an ideal version of this?

> P1: Well, you have to take your AI and drill it down to be able to understand the verbiage better. How do I get a shower chair? Well, showered chair, to me, AI then would look at that and say. He wants some kind of aid. Device aid. Who handles that? Where does that go to? Typically physical therapy or that That's one-stop shopping.

Tyler: Yeah. So… That's helpful.

Tyler: You're kind of like thinking physical aid, like physical therapy you mentioned and shower seats and stuff like all being in this bucket And the AI or the automation wasn't making that jump. And if it was like trained better, maybe it would be able to make that jump.

Tyler: And then the process would be smoother for you, right?

> P1: I look at this like it's an onion okay You peel the first layer and you peel the second. When all you want to do is cut it in half and go to the core.

> P1: Like the choice was health care. My God, that's everything. It was too broad. Dental. Ears urology Cardio, it's…

Tyler: Yeah. It's interesting to hear you talk about that because part of me starts to think, oh, it'll be better if the lists are more broad and people can be like, well, it's not It's not burials and memorials, it's healthcare. So let me choose that. And then I go into the next section. But I can see how that's too elongated. And like you said, it's like, it's just too… One small layer of the onion and then you have to do a lot, lot, lot more work. So that doesn't work well either.

> P1: That brings me back to my banking days. People who come up with the AI to make decisions alone. They had the idea. But they put too much weight on some other things. So at first it didn't work out very good.

> P1: Whoever's designing this has never sat in my chair. They're looking at strictly like this but they probably never thought Somebody needed a shower chair. And not… a physical exam.

Tyler: Yeah. So it's almost like you feel like misunderstood looking at the options. You're like, this isn't what I'm looking for. You're not understanding me.

> P1: Absolutely. Yes. Yes, that's it. [I feel misunderstood.]

Tyler: Yeah, which is a really frustrating experience to have, I imagine.

> P1: This is a quick analogy. The engineers that build a vehicle Never change the spark plug. Sometimes you can't even get, reach those cars. Okay, that type of thing.

Tyler: Yeah, makes sense. So I kind of have one more question, [P1]. So like you talked about how let's imagine that the AI was trained better. So like once you asked your question, it was like, oh, this is about physical aid. Like that's where the question should go. I'll send it to that department.

Tyler: Would you want to know that that process is happening or would you prefer to just be like, here's my question, let me send it to the VA. And kind of like hope that it's going to the right place. What's your prep?

> P1: I don't need to know

Tyler: You don't need to know what's happening. Yeah.

> P1: But I know that it is. It's happening now. Okay. But I don't need to know that. I don't care.

Tyler: Yeah. Yeah.

> P1: I don't care. Beam me up and get me there.

Tyler: Yeah. Yeah. As long as… Yeah, gotcha. So as long as it gets to the right place, it understands your question. Like that's the more important aspect of this not like you having to like help it make the right decisions and all these other things that you had to do.

> P1: Even though I'm retired, I have nothing else to do in my life. My time is still valuable to me.

Tyler: Yeah. Yeah, totally. I think… I think that's really important.

> P1: Plus, we get old and crotchety. Your patience goes thin.

Tyler: Yeah. Yeah, I mean, no stranger to having thin patients sometimes.

Tyler: I'm curious. I have one more question. I know we're at the hour.

> P1: I have no place to be. I'm good. Probably have another time.

Tyler: I have a couple of minutes as well.

Tyler: Shoot, I'm trying to remember what my question was. I'm sure it was a good one.

> P1: I'm at your disposable.

Tyler: I'm sorry. Maybe it'll come back to me.

> P1: Just start writing them down. LOL.

Tyler: At one point it mentioned that it was using other veterans questions to determine which category your question was related to. And you talked about how all veterans are very different to one another and there's a lot more like nuance in the different types of questions people ask. Did you have any other feelings when it said to you like we're using the other veterans questions to determine where your question should go?

> P1: You say, does that bother me that you're joining? Is that what you asked me?

Tyler: Does it bother you or do you have any feelings about it?

> P1: I think it's a reasonable approach. You see it all the time now. Does anybody else have that same question? And it's okay to categorize them like that, but you can't you can't sort of be broad. Even the veterans, a lot of them don't know what questions to ask.

Tyler: Yeah, I think it's really helpful overall that like what I'm learning is like, one, if we make a suggestion and it's wrong, it's very frustrating and it's like feels like it's not understanding you like automatically.

Tyler: And you would rather than just make the decision yourself. And if you're making a decision yourself based on a list of things, it seems like you would prefer that it starts much more specific than it started. In these lists. Yeah. That's really helpful.

> P1: Yeah. Simple, yeah.

Tyler: Yeah. Okay. I remembered my last question. It was, do you have experience using like a chat or like even like an AI, like an automated chat or like a virtual chat? Have you had experience using those before on websites?

> P1: Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

Tyler: What are your feelings about those?

> P1: If it's a chat bot. My patience is a very, very thin with those. And very, very thin because, again, it goes out takes you place you shouldn't want to be. Now, if you get an individual. Sometimes… it's good because they're chatting on online because he can't speak English. But sometimes they're helpful. But I only give them a short fuse you know and I blow them up.

Tyler: Yeah. Yeah.

> P1: And then they're talking to five different people. At the same time. So there's a wait time, you know.

Tyler: At the same time, yeah. Yeah.

> P1: Get to the question. Answer my question. Bye.

Tyler: Yeah, it makes sense.

Tyler: I can see how, like, especially with watching you use some of those tools, how like especially a chat bot, like a robot that you're talking to would be really frustrating for you in the similar ways where it's like.

Tyler: Making guesses and you're trying to have to correct it and it's taking a lot longer than it should. And how that's quite different to maybe talking to like your doctor on the phone, for example.

Tyler: All right. Well, [P1], thank you so much. I really enjoyed chatting with you and you gave us really good feedback today. So you've given us a lot to think about.

> P1: You say that to all the guys.

Tyler: Well, that was really great. And, I appreciate your time. I'm glad you were here. If you are interested in doing this in the future, we really love having Veterans sign up to do research with us. It definitely does. I can tell you.

> P1: I like to do these because I think it helps. And I… I have the time i have the time I'm even on the spark team for Walmart.

Tyler: I love that. Yeah, I mean, this is my job is like talking to folks about things that we're building and seeing if we're building the right things or we're doing it in the right way. I, in particular, but I know my team as well really appreciates spending the time with you because it does really help us make better decisions. So yeah, thank you.

> P1: I mean, I'm sure someone's, maybe it's you i don't know, maybe someone's saying, oh, I designed this is fantastic. Look, it's how good I did that. 

Tyler: Yeah. Yeah. You never know until you actually watch someone use it. That's for sure.

> P1: The old the saying was walk a mile in my moccasins.

Tyler: Yeah I agree with that sentiment.

Tyler: Do you have any questions for me, [P1], before we finish up?

Tyler: All right, [P1]. Well, thank you so much for your time. I hope you have a good rest of your day.

> P1: Thank you, Tyler. Goodbye, Thomas. You can wake up now.

Thomas: Thank you.

Tyler: All right. Thank you so much, [P1]. I appreciate it. Have a good day.

> P1: You do. Bye, folks. Have a great weekend.

Tyler: Bye. Yeah, you too. Thanks. See you.
