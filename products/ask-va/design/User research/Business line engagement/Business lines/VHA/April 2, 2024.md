# April 2, 2024: Form field removal pre-CCB
*Ask VA VA.gov Team*

On April 2, 2024, we met with with two business lines from VHA: Caregiver Support and ECM/HEC. This document contains notes from both meetings.

## Attendees

- Ask VA VA.gov: Becky Phung, Tyler gindraux
- CRM: Chris Clemens, Wandy Espana, Maria King, Jaime Rocha, Tamara Kanterman
- VHA: Mary Ewers (Caregiver Support)
- ECM/HEC: Morgan Fouliard, John Tice, Sara Janis, Cynthia Halls

## Summary

- We recommended removing gender and reason you're contacting us.
- Caregiver Support felt it makes sense to remove these fields.
- ECM and HEC mentioned that it's possible that someone gets in touch who has went through a gender affirmation or transition. They need to be able to locate their record. They said they can follow up with a series of questions if this does happen.

## Actions

- [ ] Becky will email VHA stakeholders from other business areas to follow up

## Notes – Caregiver Support

- Split inquiry (Tamara)
  - Tamara: “Should we change how this is calculated? By original inquiry creation date or split inquiry creation date.”
  - Mary: “It does skew our data a little bit. Our team tends to respond fairly quickly, within 2 business days. But like I said, it’s not the majority so it’s not the end of the world for us. But I know that other teams have a much different response rate so I don’t know if that’s impacting them differently than Caregiver Support.”
  - Mary: “Because we’re very quick at turning it around, it doesn’t impact us too much. But it does skew our data.
- Review of portal fields (Becky)
  - Mary: “[Removing ‘reason you contacted us’] makes sense. Some of my staff have made comments like this person said it was a compliment but it’s not. So this makes sense!”
  - Mary: “Makes sense for us. [Gender is] not even a data piece we look at for our team. The resources and information we provide – I can think of a very rare, maybe less than 1% where we provide a resource that’s specific to gender. But it’s so uncommon that it’s not going to have an impact on our team.”
  - Mary: [Pronouns] “Makes sense.”
  - Mary: “[Everything] makes sense to me. I’m on board.”
- How do you coordinate with the My HealtheVet help desk right now?
  - Here’s what that the MHV help desk that can support: 
    - Users who already have healthcare
    - Questions related to online patient portal account
    - prescription refill questions
    - account information problems (data not displaying or being incorrect / missing info)
    - login issues
    - Questions about these four major tools: secure messaging, medications, medical records, appointments
    - BTSSS
    - Co-pay payments
    - Medical supply re-ordering
    - 10-10EZR updates
  - Mary: “From an AVA standpoint, we don’t.”
  - Mary: “I would have to follow up with the other leadership members in my team to see how closely we’re working with them right now. I know we’ve worked with them a little in the past, but I’d have to see what that looks like right now.”
  - Becky: “The help desk is expecting to support on [reads list above]. I think they’re asking us because they want to know what that overlap might look like with the help desk. If you do see that overlap, let us know.”
  - Mary: “Sounds good.”
- Issues (Tamara)
  - Confirmation of inquiry submission emails are not being sent
  - We’re receiving several inquiries a day where the submitter email is blank
  - Inquiries over 25 days for VHA–Caregiver Support: 0 

## Notes – ECM and HEC

- Split inquiry (Tamara)
  - Morgan (ECM): “We’re hardly doing split inquiries anymore. We handle it or we redirect it to another business line. It’s become rather irrelevant how we calculate the split.”
- Review of portal fields (Becky)
  - Morgan (ECM): “Since we’re able to reply with secure messaging and provide information on a Veteran’s records through this system, at some point we need to have in there – we need the information, somebody goes through a gender transition and a legal name change and stuff, and they haven’t had that in their records. We have to have a way to locate their record. Should we do that through a series of messages?”
  - Becky: “I’m wondering how often this might happen? If this only happens once in a while, I think the best way would be through a series of questions.”
  - Morgan: “I know it does happen. I wouldn’t say it’s frequent but it’s common. 98% of the time this doesn’t happen. But it does happen and I don’t know the best way to handle it.”
  - Becky: “I still think the follow up messages would be best.”
- How do you coordinate with the My HealtheVet help desk right now?
  - Morgan: “We’re rerouting to another queue in Ask VA for questions.”
  - Becky: “It could be the technical passwords queue?”
  - Morgan: “I’m not sure. It’s been a while.”
  - Here’s what that the MHV help desk that can support: 
    - Users who already have healthcare
    - Questions related to online patient portal account
    - prescription refill questions
    - account information problems (data not displaying or being incorrect / missing info)
    - login issues
    - Questions about these four major tools: secure messaging, medications, medical records, appointments
    - BTSSS
    - Co-pay payments
    - Medical supply re-ordering
    - 10-10EZR updates
- Crisis inquiries
  - Morgan: “We have no way of looking back at crisis cases. I think it would be beneficial to go back and do research, so if a case is flagged as a crisis case, it shouldn’t lose that flag.”
  - Chris: “We have that on our list. But it’s not currently slated for a release.”
  - Morgan: “I appreciate that it’s still on the list.”
- Issues (Tamara)
  - Confirmation of inquiry submission emails are not being sent
  - We’re receiving several inquiries a day where the submitter email is blank
