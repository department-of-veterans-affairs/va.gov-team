## Notes

- Split inquiry
  - Joseph: “We’re timely. So it doesn’t bother us either way.”
  - Cherronda: “Although insurance is timely on our responses, it would be helpful for the calendar count to start over if we receive a split inquiry. In case the prior business line got to it behind schedule.”
  - Cherronda: “As long as the submitter understands. And there’s communication.”
- Field removal
  - Cherronda: “No questions about removing those 2 fields.”
- Unrelated inquiries
  - “There’s a lot of inquiries coming through that aren’t for life insurance. Health insurance claims. Because it says claim or health, they route it to us. There are more inquiries about website access. And about Militax.”
