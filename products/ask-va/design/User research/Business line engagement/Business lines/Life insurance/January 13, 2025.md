# January 13, 2025: Life insurance topic issues

*Ask VA VA.gov Team*

## Attendees

- Ask VA VA.gov Team: Becky Phung, Tyler Gindraux
- Ask VA CRM Team: Tamara Kanterman, Chris Clemens, Shelby Carl, Natalie Morales
- Life Insurance Team: Joseph Melvin, Adam Woolf, Rebecca Brenen, Valerie Valach

## Key takeaways

- We lean towards removing these topics and would like to confirm with Jeremy Haas of Web Operations:
   - Signing in to VA life insurance portal (under `Sign in and technical issues` category)
   - Accessing policy online (under `Life insurance` category)
   - Insurance website issues (under `Life insurance` category)
- We could also consider adding 'life' before these topics, so they would be:
   - Insurance claims > Life insurance claims (under `Life insurance` category)
   - Insurance premiums > Life insurance premiums (under `Life insurance` category) 
- We'd also like to review the topics under the `Health care` category. Right now, `Life insurance` is the only category and/or topic that uses the word 'insurance' and we think this could be why people are submitting other types of insurance inquiries, usually related to VHA, under the `Life insurance` topic called, `Other`.
- We aren't able to make these changes right now. We will have to release on VA.gov with the current topic lists, but we should look at re-routing once we're live on VA.gov and assess whether this is still an issue. We can action changes on VA.gov.

## Notes

### Topic: Signing in to VA life insurance portal

- Becky: Our suggestion is to route this to VA Web Operations.
- Joe: That makes the most sense, because the call center can only do so much with the Veteran. And most of the re-routes are because they aren’t life insurance specific, they just can’t log in to VA.gov. They might not even have a VA Life policy.
- Joe: Exactly where you said it could go, is where it should go. (Meaning, it should route to VACO VA.gov Web Operations).
- Joe: On occasion, the life insurance team could help with issues with log in to pay.gov, for example. We do all that. But sometimes it’s not those questions.
- Natalie: We could just remove this topic?
- Tyler: I agree with removal. If Web Operations receives inquiries about insurance issues (under a different topic) as a result, they can re-route to life insurance if they can't solve them themselves.
- Chris: Let’s check with Jeremy Haas about this. If we remove the life insurance topic, they may receive some things related to life insurance.
- Tyler: There are also two topics under life insurance related to sign in. For example, ‘Accessing policy online’ and ‘Insurance website issues.’
- Joe: Most of the time, we need to sit there and tell them for ID.me you need to call, etc. We will give them the Pay.gov link.
- Joe: Don’t have IT support in life insurance. Refer them elsewhere.
- Joe: I’m the policy services rep. Anything dealing with first time, if they have an SDVI policy, if they already have a VA Life policy. I can see what’s going on, what their question is, etc. Most of the time I am taking away access for them, go in and manually send their policy out to them, and then re-grant access. I do that a couple times a week.
- Joe: Our new life insurance policy is for people who did not apply the first time. [Etc.]
- Tyler: Is it fair to say that the extent of the "IT support" you can offer is related to pay.gov?
- Joe: We do pay.gov, but we have our own portal that we help with too. The life insurance portal.
- Tyler: Do you know whether people ask questions about pay.gov and/or your life insurance portal using these topics? Or do they submit a question under the topic that their policy is related to?
- Joe: You're right, they most often use VA Life right now. Not the IT topics.
- Becky: Our options are to route to Web Operations. Or to remove this topic. We lean towards removing the topic. We should confirm with Jeremy Haas.

### Topic: Other

- Becky: We have a couple ideas. For example, add a CHAMPVA topic under life insurance, or, review the health care topics to see if something is missing.
- Tyler: I hesitate to add a VHA topic under Life insurance. We're teaching people that they're related, when they're not.
- Tyler: I like the idea of reviewing VHA topics. Life insurance is the only category (or topic) that uses the word insurance, and that could be confusing people who have questions about their health care coverage.
- Joe: We get things for CHAMPVA and VHA. Not just life insurance.
- Joe: We talked about this with CHAMPVA last month, I didn’t even know it went through VHA. We never looked at it being related to VHA.
- Joe: I handle most ‘Other' that comes to us.
- Joe: Sometimes I will give 222 VETS to start with VHA for these questions, rather than re-routing.
- Becky: One thing we can do is add a topic that will route to VHA HAC CHAMPVA. People could incorrectly select this.
- Tyler/Becky: We can monitor whether or how re-routing is impacted when we go live on VA.gov.
- Tyler: Let's review health care topics to see where using the word “insurance” might help.
- Chris: There’s no mention of insurance anywhere else except as “life insurance.” They might not even know the acronym for the program, but they know it’s insurance.
- Tyler: We could think about borrowing some language from this VA.gov content page, when we review health care topics: https://www.va.gov/health-care/about-va-health-benefits/va-health-care-and-other-insurance/
- Joe: We’re the only one that includes the word insurance. And I guess that’s why we’re getting those questions, even though we know that one is VHA. We even get questions about auto and everything else
