# August 23, 2023: Center for Minority Veterans business line review
*Ask VA Integration Team*

## Agenda

- Introductions
- Review AVA form fields
- Review category and topic names

## Attendees

- Our team: Tyler, Thomas
- Center for Minority Veterans: Carl McPherson, Dwayne Cambell
- CRM team: Chris Clemens, Jamie Rocha, Shelby

## Key takeaways

- The Center for Minority Veterans can be a "free-for-all," if submitters can't find a category that relates to their question.
- Responses to `Tell us the reason you're contacting us?` **aren't currently being used** by the Center, to sort through inquiries or create reports, for example.
- The Center **doesn't recall any requests for submitters to be contacted by US Mail**.
- They are fine with updating the category name from `VA Center for Minority Veterans` to `Center for Minority Veterans`.
- We discussed the difference between `policies` and `programs` and learned that they're **contacted about programs more than policies.**:
> "More people ask about programs."
- There's one program that's specific to minority Veterans, which is a topic in `Home Loan Guaranty/All VA Mortgage Issues`:
> "The only program that really is specific to minority Veterans is the Native American Home Loan Guaranty."
- Overall, they don't mind updating to the proposed names. But both topics route to the same place, so there's an **opportunity to consolidate to one topic**:
> "It would be simpler if it was one thing: Programs and policies."
