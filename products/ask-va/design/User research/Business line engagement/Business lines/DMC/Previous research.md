# DMC Write Up

### Submitted by: Tamara Dorle on April 18, 2022

Notes:
- The list from DMC is broken out below. Generating this list was slightly more difficult than we originally predicted.
- Although DMC owns specific types (topics) under VA debt category such as A School Official, referencing topics seemed less relevant.
- For the most part, inquiries that DMC can respond need to be based on debt collection rather than debt creation or benefit questions affecting overpayments. We felt that DMC is unique here because the AVA inquiry must be related to a debt specific to DMC collection.
- DMC doesn’t collect on all types of VA debts such as medical or separation pay or school VR&E, VRAP and others. Just because “debt” exists in an inquiry or a submitter selects a certain topic doesn’t mean the inquiry should go the one of the DMC queues.
- SCOs and Veterans including VA employees do not always understand the collection role of DMC.
- Sorting by topic for routing purposes determined by topic related to “debt” can’t be done alone.; however, we hope the list below will help reduce VA misdirected inquiries.

We are requesting the following from you (in the form of a Word document or email) so that we can begin to workshop a reference document for agents to assist in correctly routing.

#### 1. Provide any point(s) of contact who are responsible for process documentation and/or are subject matter experts in terms of routing and queues for your LoB
- Tamara Dorle
- Charles Symes
- Lynne Nottage

#### 2. Provide a list of most common correctly routed topics in the form of submitter questions (submitter questions you can answer)

    - RPO decisions on disputes / responses (re-routes) on SCO disputes
    - School Debt list request
    - School Debt disputes (disagree with debt amount, reason, terms)
    - SCOs asking about School Debt Payments (in turn, may have been misapplied, checks mailed, ACH/CC funds, etc.)
    - SCOs request a Debt Letter
    - TOP offset on an account

    - Status of request previously submitted
    - Audit / payment history requests

#### 3. Provide a list of items that seem like they would belong to your LoB, but don’t (submitter questions you cannot answer). Ex: DMC does not handle medical debt/ payments for medical services
- Questions concerning:
  - SCHOOLS & VETERANS:
    - School (Voc-Rehab) VR&E debt questions

    - Medical debts
    - Separation debts
    - VRAP debts
    - Correction request of debts
    - VA Home Loan eligibility questions
    - Reason for debts /changes in benefits (DMC can’t always provide reason)
    - Corrections/adjustments in debts (providing documentation for benefits such as statement of claims)
    - Disputes (can go directly to RPO but DMC will suspend collection)
    - Debt calculations or how debt is prorated  (RPO provides)
    - Mitigating circumstances request for debt adjustments
