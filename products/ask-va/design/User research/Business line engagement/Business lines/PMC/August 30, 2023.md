# August 30, 2023: PMC business line review
*Ask VA VA.gov Team*

## Agenda

- Introductions
- Review AVA form fields
- Review category and topic names

## Attendees
 
- Our team: Tyler, Becky, Ruchi, Chante
- CRM team: Shelby, Wayne, Maria, Jaime
- Pension/Fiduciary: Angelita Taylor, Nancy Williams
- NCC: Scott Hadley
- VBA-Outreach, Transition & Economic Development (OTED): Robert Eakman
- VBA-ART: Breon Johnson
- Not present: Jennifer Fuhrer (Pension/Fiduciary)

## Key takeaways

- Breon noted that VBA ART does not refer to the submitter's response to `tell us the reason you're contacting us`:
> "VBA ART does not use that. We focus on the content of the question."

- All teams said they'll use which contact method a submitter prefers:
> "We do respond in the manner they request unless there's any issue with the contact method. If they ask for mail, we will do that. Same for phone, email.""

- All teams said they don't use `gender` to answer inquiries:
> "We don't use that at all. Especially if someone has pronouns. Most of our responses are auto-generated. We don't pull reports about this or anything like that. We don't use it.""

- The military service information fields are used for authentication purposes, Breon said:
> "We need their name, branch of service and SSN. Service number is kind of outdated. We don't really use that or the EDIPI number. But that might change."

- We proposed the category be updated to `Disability compensation` with mixed feedback. We plan to follow up with Breon, too:
> "Best just to leave it as compensation."
>
> "I would prefer to be consistent with what's on VA.gov. I'm okay with changing it because that's how VA.gov has that language."

- We learned that `Fiduciary program` does not always include guardianship or custodianship (it's more complex than that). So we're considering using the label, `Fiduciary program (Guardianship or Custodianship)` across Ask VA. This is a category name, but also a topic name a few times within Ask VA.

- We proposed removing `investigations` from the `Field examination` topic, and noted this feedback:
> "They are investigations. To include everything it should be left the way it is. They can be examined but they can also be investigated.""

> "Field examination is not an examination for medical purposes. An examiner goes to the beneficiary, it should include both examination and investigation in the topic."

- We asked whether `Aid and Attendance Benefits` should include `Housebound benefits` and learned:
> "On the application, it does say Aid and Attendance and housebound. If you put it together it'll be fine, but nothing wrong with just Aid and Attendance Benefits."
