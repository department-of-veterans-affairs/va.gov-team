## Key takeaways

- The Center for Women Veterans (CWV) uses gender identity data to report on how many women Veterans they've helped.
> "At the end of the fiscal year I pull a report of all the AVAs we worked on; and sometimes I segregate by gender as well. X amount of inquiries from female Veterans; X amount of inquiries from male Veterans. We need to know their gender so we can split these inquiries."

> "Everytime we do anything, we have to say how many women Veterans we’ve helped. We have to keep our congressional mandate in mind, that we are here to support women Veterans."
- They're only pulling reports for CWV inquiries, but, sometimes they go to other business lines and ask for this information.
> "If I go to VBA to ask for data, I have to ask them for how many women Veterans they’ve helped."

> "We can’t control what other folks do, but for us, gender is something we have to have."

> "It’s not only when they ask us for data but it’s also when we ask them for data on certain things. With our mandate, not only are we looking at how we help women Veterans but we’re also looking at how VA enterprise wide is helping Veterans on various issues. It helps us know what we need to do to help women Veterans."
- Pronouns are different to gender identity. Right now, they don't focus on the pronoun field for reporting.
> "Pronouns are completely different from gender identity. Someone could say I’m non-binary and I want to go by them/they. Or it could be a female Veteran who is still trying to determine who she/he/they is. I can’t say for sure that their pronouns will help me get to the number for how many women we helped."

- In [October](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/research/Business%20line%20engagement/Center%20for%20Women%20Veterans/October%2012%2C%202023.md), we agreed to condense the number of topic in AVA for the CWV category. Instead of a long list of many topics (for reporting purposes), we will have two topics: `Programs and policies` and `General question`. This means the CWV will need to approach other business lines to understand how many women Veterans are asking about `Debt` or `Education`, for example. With this in mind, we all agree that it's important we keep collecting Gender across all categories in AVA.

### Decision

We will keep gender identity across all categories. It will be required. We will collect the gender of the submitter.

## Actions

- [ ] Becky: Send meeting notes
- [ ] Tyler: Update design documentation to confirm Gender identity = Required for all categories
