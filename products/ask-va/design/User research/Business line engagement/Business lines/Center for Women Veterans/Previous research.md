We are requesting the following from you (in the form of a Word document or email) so that we can begin to workshop a reference document for agents to assist in correctly routing.

#### 1. Provide any point(s) of contact who are responsible for process documentation and/or are subject matter experts in terms of routing and queues for your LoB:

- Benjamin L. Davis (Benjamin.Davis2@va.gov)
- Aimee Clement (Aimee.Clement@va.gov)
- Nicole DeLeon (Nicole.Deleon@va.gov)


#### 2. Provide a list of most common correctly routed topics in the form of submitter questions (submitter questions you are able to answer)

- Questions concerning:
  - Questions pertaining to how to reconnect with VA health care if a Veteran applied a long time ago but never used their benefits
  - General information inquiries concerning health care services available to women Veterans, such as services pertaining to infertility, mental health, Military Sexual Trauma (MST), reproductive health, and maternity care
