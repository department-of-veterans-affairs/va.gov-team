*Ask VA Integration Team*

## Attendees

- Our team: Becky, Tyler, Ruchi
- VR&E team:  David Smith, Robert Eakman, Victor Breon Johson
- CRM team: Shelby, Chris, Jaime
- Not present: Krystal Connor

## Key takeaways

- Most proposed names were minor changes to sentence case.
- `About the program` could help agents get more program-specific questions.
> "We also get general question about DD214s and how can I enroll in other programs? Just general information. I do like `About the program`"

- The follow-up topic is a catch-all for submitters to request a follow up online rather than having to call someone.
> "Someone is following up on their application or their counselor. They do have direct contact to pick up the phone. They might be out of office. A follow-up would be for someone from the office to follow up."

## Actions
