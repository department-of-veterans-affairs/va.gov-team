## Notes

- Question: Should split inquiries start fresh? Or still inherit the original createdon date
  - If rerouting doesn’t reset the clock, then splitting shouldn’t reset the clock
  - We don’t get a lot of split tickets - but sometimes we get delays in getting the assignment to us - from rerouting and splitting debate - should not reset the clock
  - VA wants to know how long it takes for a response to occur - which can impact how long teams have to respond if the previous team routing delays sending.
- External inquiries printing
  - Request from school certifying officials: They can request printouts of their inquiries but can’t print them themselves
  - Includes PII is included on these - I don’t want my teams PII being on there
  - SCOs (School Certifying Officials) doesn’t matter -” but if it was from other submitters - we absolutely wouldn’t do it”
  - Desire to print whole inquiry for putting in students file - some of the information would need to be blacked out -
  - We are not opposed to doing this - we just need your input on what we should show - ex agent identifying information - they are taking this offline - but it sounds like they are asking for a mock up of what could be sent
  - Maybe June release
  - Needs a communications plan to support
- Gender
  - Jackie - gender or pronouns - okay to remove
  - Tammy asked if we really do want to remove VA Employee - she asked Jacque
  - Chris - It’s a PATSR thing - that looks at VA employees using VA services - the only way we can tell if someone is an employee is if they tell us
  - Becky : Other systems already provide this info - so we don’t need to ask this - during testing this was a confusing question
  - Jacque - might need to be addressed - it’s very broad to be a VA employee - our action really matters only to VA employee in Education - it’s not something we need to know - but not sure about SCO’s  - then someone else and said - we don’t need this information and this answer satisfied Tammy
  - Chris said you (GI Bill Team)  won’t see the Veteran screen - so it’s not relevant
- Tell us the reason you are contacting us
  - Ran out of time
  - Tammy said they will look at this on their own time
- Other questions (didn’t get to)
  - Do you still have challenges with files uploaded to QuickSubmit going to VBMS instead of TIMS?
  - Do you still have challenges with not knowing (1) who submitted a file and (2) what date they submitted it on if files are uploaded to QuickSubmit?
