## GI Bill Work-Study Write Up

#### Submitted by: Kendra Stewart on March 21, 2022

We are requesting the following from you (in the form of a Word document or email) so that we can begin to workshop a reference document for agents to assist in correctly routing.

##### 1. Provide any point(s) of contact who are responsible for process documentation and/or are subject matter experts in terms of routing and queues for your LoB
- All of our WS Coordinators that have the agent role are trained in routing inquiries to specific queues (Usually the Muskogee CSR or Buffalo CSR queues) when needed.
- In addition, our Lead Srs and Coaches have supervisor access and are trained to re-route to appropriate queues as needed. 

##### 2. Provide a list of most common correctly routed topics in the form of submitter questions (submitter questions you can answer)
- Attached is a time record for processing
- See attached time record and signed agreement
- Time sheet for _____
- Submitting Timecard for payment
- Requesting a new Work-Study contract
- New Application attached, please process
- Requesting 30-day extension for student
- Contract Extension request
- Work Study Application
- Signed Contract
- Work-Study Supervisor changes
- Work-Study site changes
- Interested in Work-Study
- Often times the Work-Study Site Supervisor submitting the student request will include the student’s name in the question section.

##### 3. Provide a list of items that seem like they would belong to your LoB, but don’t (submitter questions you cannot answer). Ex: DMC does not handle medical debt/ payments for medical services

We see on occasion the following that require us to re-route to Muskogee CSR or Buffalo 
CSR. These do not seem like they would belong to Work Study, but somewhere there is confusion, 
and we see OJT certifications.
- Monthly Cert
- OJT Cert
- OJT Application
- OJT hours for submission
- On the other hand, there are times when the submitter selects “GI BILL” and “Post 9-11” when they should be requesting Work-Study. These then sit in the wrong queue and are not answered as timely as they could have been.
Additionally, for our CH31 recipients using Work Study benefits, sometimes documents are sent to VRE counselors instead of being correctly assigned to Work Study.

## GI Bill- Buffalo and Muskogee Write Up

#### Submitted by: Jacqueline Mikoley and Lisa Eaton on March 29, 2022

We are requesting the following from you (in the form of a Word document or email) so that we can begin to workshop a reference document for agents to assist in correctly routing.

##### 1. Provide any point(s) of contact who are responsible for process documentation and/or are subject matter experts in terms of routing and queues for your LoB

- All Buffalo VCEs with Agent role are familiar with routing within LOB, however struggle with routing outside our LOB and generally refer those to me.

##### 2. Provide a list of most common correctly routed topics in the form of submitter questions (submitter questions you are able to answer)

GI BILL-RELATED QUESTIONS – ALL TOPICS LISTED BELOW CAN BE ADDRESSED IF THEY ARE RELATED TO GI BILL EDUCATION BENEFITS.  HOWEVER, THEY MAY OR MAY NOT BE.

- A School Official
- Appeal located at a regional office generally rerouted from other LOB/ GI BILL SHOULD HAVE OWN APPEAL TOPIC
- Colmery Section 110 – this topic is routinely chosen incorrectly, so goes to the wrong local queue for the question, but specialists for that queue can handle other GI Bill Questions
- Direct deposit inquiries – these are generally rerouted from other LoBs
- Dispute Audit Debt- depends, could be DMC could be edu, needs better definition for submitters to drive to GI Bill or DMC GI BILL NEEDS OWN DEBT TOPIC
- Education Debt – depends, could be DMC, could be edu.  Needs a better definition for submitters to drive to GI Bill or DMC.  GI BILL NEEDS ITS OWN DEBT TOPIC
- Filing for Benefits
- Financial Issues – rerouted from another LoB
- General Information
- GI BILL
- Issues/Questions About Benefits Received
- Licensing and Certification

- VR&E SHOULD NOT BE A GI BILL CATEGORY

##### 3. Provide a list of items that seem like they would belong to your LoB, but don’t (submitter questions you cannot answer). Ex: DMC does not handle medical debt/ payments for medical services
- Certain debt inquiries– if the claimant is referring to a notice received from DMC likely belongs to DMC
- VR&E claimants looking for payment under VR&E
- Benefits outside the U.S. – a category that may be for Edu but not necessarily
- Compensation - submitters often select this incorrectly when they mean education benefits
- VR&E claimants looking for payment under Edu
- Appeals – Education also has Higher Level Review/Request for Supplemental Claim (Submitters think of appeals as all-encompassing)
- Compensation/Aid and Attendance – Submitters “attendance
- Schools asking for a debt explanation, overpayment/underpayment, etc. these need to be reviewed by an education processor.
- Survivor Benefits as a category – GI Bill Education also has “Survivor Benefits” CH35 DEA, CH33FRY
