# December 18, 2023: Uploading documents topic

*Ask VA Front-End Team*

Last updated by @beckyphung: December 21, 2023

## Background

This document was created by the Ask VA front-end team after gathering insights from Education and Work Study, and Beth Potts, OCTO Content Lead.

### Problem

- Sometimes AVA inquiries don't require a question, submitters just need to send a document. But the question field is required in the form, so submitters write something in this field regardless.
- This makes it difficult to sort which inquiries are document-only, so Veterans Claims Examiners (VCE) waste time sorting through inquiries
- If we include a ‘Uploading documents (only)’ topic, then submitters who have questions about uploading documents, or questions and need to upload a document, may choose this topic incorrectly.
- Work Study uses the question field to search for inquiries that may have been routed to the wrong queues and belong to them. If there’s a topic that doesn’t include a question field, it will be difficult for them to filter and find it.
- The Education service recommends that people use QuickSubmit when they just need to upload a document, but there can still be follow-up questions inquiring if they receive the documents which duplicates workload for agents.

### How might we?

- How might we make it simple for submitters to just send a document?
- How might we make it faster for VCEs to recognize which inquiries are simply document uploads?
- How might we make it clear to people who have questions about submitting documents, or questions and need to upload documents, which topic to use?
- How might we help submitters check whether they picked the right topic?
- How might we make it clear that a document has been received/processed when it comes through QuickSubmit?
- How might we send people to QuickSubmit when they just need to upload a document?

### Outstanding questions

- How often does a submitter _just_ need to upload a document, and not ask a question as well?
- Why do submitters use QuickSubmit and AVA? Do some submitters use them interchangeably? Do they just use AVA to follow up on what they sent through QuickSubmit?

## Next steps

Given the risk of adding a topic for uploading documents and the overlap with QuickSubmit, we will:
- hold off adding this as a topic in Ask VA
- connect with the OCTO team who is reviewing QuickSubmit
