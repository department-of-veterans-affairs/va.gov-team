## Key takeaways

- `Tell us the reason you’re contacting us` **is sometimes used for reporting.** For example, if they hear of an issue from the call center, agents may search through the `complaints`.
    - But, `complaint` can be too broad; a submitter might have a complaint about the system or about their claim decision, for example.
    - We think there could be an opportunity to remove or reimagine this field.
- In response to `I am a` submitters can choose `VA Employee`, even though **there’s another question that already asks if someone is a VA employee.** This is because:
> “They each have different impacts on the logic.”
- We think there's **an opportunity to remove** `How should we get in touch with you?` knowing that submitters will always receive a response over email if they submit an education related question through Ask VA.
    - Even if we don't ask for their preference, we should still collect their phone number, because "it's usually the most up-to-date information."
- The `subject` field is useful for agents to sort through inquiries and should remain. **The root of the issue is submitters not choosing the right topics.**
> "I feel strongly that submitters need more help identifying topics. If that was the case, we might not depend on these other fields."
- It's necessary to keep `suffix` for identification, but it should remain not required.
- There is **hesitation** about updating `Education (Ch.30, 33, 35, 1606, etc. & Work Study)` to `Education and training` because:
    - submitters for VR&E (Ch 31) may choose this category on accident
    - submitters are familiar with the chapters
- We agreed to update the subtopic `Inquiries (VAI)` to	`General question`. We still need to review the rest of the topics and subtopics more closely.
