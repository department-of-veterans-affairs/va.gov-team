# August 30, 2023: Benefits issues outside US category review
*Ask VA Integration Team*

## Agenda

- Introductions
- Review AVA form fields
- Review category and topic names

## Attendees
 
- Our team: Tyler, Becky, Ruchi, Chante
- CRM team: Shelby, Wayne, Maria, Jaime
- NCC: Scott Hadley
- VBA-Outreach, Transition & Economic Development (OTED): Robert Eakman
- VBA-ART: Breon Johnson

## Key takeaways

- We proposed the category be updated to `Veterans living outside the U.S.' but were reminded it's not just for Veterans. `Benefits outside the U.S.` would be more comprehensive:
> "Veterans aren't the only ones who claim. It could be a spouse, for example. It's too limiting."
