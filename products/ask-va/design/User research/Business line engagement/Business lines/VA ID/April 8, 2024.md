- Becky referred to both proposed field removals

- Split Inquiries:
  - 6 days in queue before it got to them (with 7 days to close ticket as requirement)
  - Keep or change? Jeremy: our concerns will always be the total time - days in queues, so this works for us
- Does your team ever reroute to the My HealtheVet help desk? Weâ€™re trying to understand how Ask VA overlaps with other support channels.
  - How do you handle these requests?
  - Jeremy: only gotten a few - they are usually more log in related - and were able to help them resolve this. I expect we will see more and more of them - currently not a big problem
  - Becky with the migration of tools impact
  - Jeremy - early discussions - a lot to sort out from a support perspective
