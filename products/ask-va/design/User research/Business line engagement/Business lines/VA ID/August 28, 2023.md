# August 28, 2023: VA ID business line review
*Ask VA Integration Team*

## Agenda

- Introductions
- Review AVA form fields
- Review category and topic names

## Attendees

- Our team: Chante, Tyler, Ruchi, Thomas
- VA ID team: Jeremy Hass, Elijah Arogundade 
- CRM team: Shelby, Jaime (dropped off early), Maria

## Key takeaways

- `Tell us the reason you're contacting us?`: Answers to this question arenâ€™t that helpful to answer inquiries but can be somewhat helpful for organizing data.

- `How should we get in touch with you?`: Agents respond mostly by email and occasionally phone.
> "Typically we use email as a default. We're not set up to do a lot of callbacks."

- `Veteran's Gender*`: It can help to know the gender to identify a veteran, especially when the submitter provides minimal information.

- Military service fields: EDIPI and SSN are most helpful to identify a veteran. Some fields are needed in other scenarios in this category, like agents needing `Service number` to create a record.
> "To create a record, we need their service number."

- The team approved most of the proposed names and are open to merging some sub-topics by working with the CRM team.

## Actions
