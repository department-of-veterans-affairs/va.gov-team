## Notes

- Split inquiries inherit original inquiry createdon date
  - Should split inquiries start fresh? Or still inherit the original created on date?
  - Richard: We don’t receive that many split inquiries - we’re good.
- Form field removal
  - Michael, we are not using this data and does not impact our ability to answer questions - I doubt we will be asked to get this data in the future - but I have seen a lot of data requests I didn’t expect (data flow - volume - not demographic) 
  - Who they support: Families of any descendants - requesting update on application for headstone or marker
- External inquiries printing - per Michael - they are good
