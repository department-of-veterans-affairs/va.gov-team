# May 21, 2024:  Preferred names and pronouns discussion  
_Ask VA VA.gov Team_

## Attendees
- Ask VA VA.gov: Becky Phung
- Ask VA CRM: Jaime Rocha, Natalie Morales, Kathleen Reavy, Shelby Carl, Kyle Polewacyzk
- OIT Enterprise Architecture: Nancy Clarkson

## Summary
### Pronouns/Preferred name
- Data Demographics Work Group (DDWG)/Data Governance Council (DGC) proposed and approved Sexual Orientation Gender Identity (SOGI) traits.
- Pronouns and Preferred name are both self-identified only, meaning only the submitter could provide this data. However, Nancy will follow-up with John Williams if our use case makes sense (only asking for the subject to refer to someone in the third-person). 
- The design component for Pronouns needs to be updated based on these different standards. For now, we can continue to use this component from VADS though. 

### Updating profile data
- Guidance from VA, and an ask we've heard from Veterans, is to allow Veterans to only update information once, so it updates everywhere.
- Right now, we only allow temporary updates because CRM doesn't have write access to VA Profile, but this may change around September of this year. 
- We need to weigh the impact of adjusting our design to anticipate this change, or hold on making this change until after Phase 1.

## Actions
