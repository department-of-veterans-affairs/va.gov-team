# Feedback on form fields

Last updated by @tygindraux on October 13, 2023

## Background

We are proposing to remove some fields from the Ask VA form. As part of this process, we have reviewed these fields with all business lines to gather their feedback. This document summarizes our findings from those reviews.

## Insights

### Tell us the reason you're contacting us? (*Required)

- Despite being a required field for all categories, most agents aren't familiar with this field. This implies they are not using it help answer inquiries.
- In theory this field could be useful for receiving complaints and compliments.Â 
- But, most inquiries are 'questions' and 'complaint' might be too broad to be useful.
- Town Hall is very uncommonly seen by agents.
> **Takeaway: Continue with recommendation to remove this field.**

### How should we get in touch with you? (*Required)
- We validated which business lines currently don't offer all contact options; and found some new ones:
  - Email and phone only: Caregiver support (Current), DEERS can't easily send mail (Potential)
  - Email only: Education (Current), Audiology only responds via the form (Potential), VIC is email only (Potential), ECM (Eligibility) is email only (Current)
> **Takeaway: Do not continue with recommendation to remove this field.**

> **Takeaway: Create a new ticket to verify contact options with all business lines.**

> **Update 10/13: We verified contact options with all business lines, see [list of contact options](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/research/Business%20line%20engagement/List%20of%20contact%20options.md).**

### Veteran service information fields

> **Takeaway: Gather more comprehensive feedback from business lines before we recommend removal.**

> **Update 10/13: We gathered more comprehensive feedback from all business lines, see [list of military service fields](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/research/Business%20line%20engagement/List%20of%20military%20service%20fields.md).**

### Gender
- We did not review this field with all business lines. But of the business lines, we asked, none explicitly need to know gender.
- This includes:
  - Health care
  - Pension
  - Fiduciary
  - Compensation
  - VR&E
  - Housing
  - VBA-ART
  - Burials and Memorials
  - Survivor Benefits
  - DEERS
  - Technical issues
> **Takeaway: Confirm whether the Women Veterans business line requires this (for their category and/or for all categories).**

> **Update 10/13: We confirmed that there is a Congressional Mandate which states the requirement to collect data on Gender. We will explore this more with the CWV.
