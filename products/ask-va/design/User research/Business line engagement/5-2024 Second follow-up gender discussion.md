# May 20, 2024:  Follow-up gender discussion  
_Ask VA VA.gov Team_

## Attendees
- Ask VA VA.gov: Becky Phung
- Ask VA CRM: Jaime Rocha, Natalie Morales
- Center for Women Veterans: Tiglao Lourdes, Mary Bradford
- LGBTQ+ Health Program: Alexis (Lexi) Matza, Anna Donovan
- CX Data Modelling: Megan Kelley  

## Summary
### Key takeaways
- We confirmed CWV analysts need AVA data and gender identity data to understand how effective and efficient we are at serving underserved populations, specifically Veterans who identify as women
- The CX Data Modelling team can support in creating a report that joins Ask VA data with gender identity data from MPI. They'll join the data through Veterans' ICN, which is a unique identifier for Veterans.
- Misrouting to CWV is another challenge. CWV can answer any question for women Veterans but currently receive questions from non-women Veterans. Asking submitters for gender identity will probably not solve this challenge. Routing is primarily determined by submitters selecting a category and topic.
  
## Actions
- [ ] Becky to work with Jaime to schedule CCB meeting
- [ ] Becky to follow up with Megan in the next few weeks to know when we can start the report workÂ
