# May 6, 2024:  Follow-up gender discussion  
_Ask VA VA.gov Team_

## Attendees
- Ask VA VA.gov: Becky Phung
- Ask VA CRM: Jaime Rocha, Natalie Morales, Kathleen Reavy
- Center for Women Veterans: Shannon Middleton, Tiglao Lourdes, Mary Bradford
- LGBTQ+ Health Program: Alexis (Lexi) Matza, Ryan Mackie, Anna Donovan

## Summary
### Key takeaways
- We don't need to collect birth sex.
- We do need to access gender identity data for reporting. We need to understand how often people are using Ask VA, categorized by different gender identity.
- We don't need gender identity data to properly address people because we have pronouns and preferred name already.
### Other discussion points
- Data accuracy is a VA-wide challenge.
- Birth sex (only) won't fulfill reporting needs.
- We don't want to have siloed data.
- We don't want to add burden to Ask VA staff who answer questions.
- MPI is the authoritative source for sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) traits.
