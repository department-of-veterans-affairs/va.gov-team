## Background

We regularly do user research with submitters to understand their experiences using Ask VA. During research, we've received feedback about what submitters expect from VA's responses through Ask VA. The purpose of this document is to share this feedback with Ask VA business lines.

In these research studies, we used actual responses that have been sent to submitters through Ask VA in the past. The responses were anonymized and any minor changes we made maintained the integrity of the original response. Rather than sharing the specific responses we tested, we've generalized this feedback so it can be useful to all business lines.

## Feedback

**1. Veterans anticipate that inquiries marked as solved by VA will not actually feel solved for submitters. Even before they read a reply from VA, Veterans expect to be frustrated.**

> "Is it just [going to be typical] VA, like, no, you don't qualify for that, and that's the end of it. They say it's solved, well, I still have my issue. What else? What other things are available? What other resources are available to me?"

**2. Veterans always need a next step. Even if they've asked about a benefit or service that they're ineligible for, they expect to receive information or advice about other options.**

> "It doesn't seem like you're putting any care into this or trying to help a Veteran get the benefits that they deserve. You're just straight up, just like, no, not that."

**3. Veterans are likely to misunderstand the meaning of VA's response or have follow up questions. If anything is left to interpretation, they risk not understanding or getting confused.**

> "So, when you read that whole thing, it's mumble jumbled like, okay, [I still have questions.]"

> "Yeah, that is very confusing, [it's] like [one] run on sentence [...] It's a very confusing answer. So, I'm trying to decipher what they're saying."

**4. Veterans are generally unfamiliar with terminology and jargon internal to VA. This applies to acronyms and department names or structures.**

> "It's telling you what alphabet suit group is responding."

**5. Veterans are frustrated by responses that seem "obviously copy and pasted" or canned. If responses are not specific and personal, people prefer to use instant, automated tools. This includes business submitters, who often choose Ask VA for more complex questions, expecting more specific answers.**

> "This was a canned answer and I'm [frustrated with] him, her, they or the computer that generated it."

> "There's no personality to it. [...] It's zero compassion or empathy. It's cut and dry with the VA."

## Recommendations

These recommendations are meant to improve submitters' experiences with Ask VA. That being said, we're aware that many of you may already be doing these things when writing your responses.

1. **Provide a next step.** This could be a URL to read more information, advice about other avenues they can explore or someone else to contact.
2. **Use simple words and phrases and be concise.** Short, conversational sentences without jargon or abbreviations are easier to read. This [plain language guidance](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/words/) is helpful. 
3. **Remind submitters that you're human.** Being specific and empathetic reminds submitters that they're speaking to a person and you're on their side. This is what makes Ask VA standout.
