## Purpose

### Research goals

- Review how support channels are described and distinguished from one another
- Review how teams measure the success of each support channel (where possible)
- Review the steps required to receive help from each support channel

### Outcome

This will help us articulate when people should use Ask VA instead of another support channel. And consider whether we need to design better seams between Ask VA and other channels. It will feed into product vision exercises we plan to do with partners.

### Methodology

1. Identify channels to compare.
2. Review support experience of each channel.
3. Compare to Ask VA.

## Analysis

I reviewed the following support channels:

- [My HealtheVet Secure Messaging (MHV SM)](https://www.va.gov/health-care/secure-messaging/)
- [VA chatbot](https://www.va.gov/contact-us/virtual-agent/)
- [My HealtheVet (MHV) contact form](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/contact-mhv)
- [VET-HOME Inquiry](https://vethome.va.gov/inquiry/)
- MyVA411 main information line
- VA benefits hotline
- VA health benefits hotline
- GI Bill hotline
- National Call Center for Homeless Veterans
- My HealtheVet help desk

I reviewed each channel and took notes in [Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1738276336649/31f5cc8b2eb56f67173d0318e5e38bda887b53bd). (Note: You may not have access to this Mural board.) 

### My HealtheVet Secure Messaging (MHV SM)

**Purpose.** My HealtheVet Secure Messaging (MHV) is described as a way to "communicate privately online with your VA health care team." It's for non-urgent health-related questions. And takes up to 3 business days to receive a reply. You can use MHV SM to do things like request VA referrals, test results and prescriptions, manage VA health appointments, and get health care updates. If you have other questions, that MHV SM can't help with, they direct you to FAQs or the MHV help desk (phone number) or MHV contact form. There is no link to Ask VA.

**Metrics.** From a glance, this team measures engagement rates and bounce rates with the goal of increasing Veterans' involvement in managing their health care and adoption of SM.

**Steps.** You can use MHV SM, if you're enrolled in VA health care, are registered as a patient at a VA health facility and your provider has agreed to communicate with your through SM. After you sign in, you can write messages, save drafts, review your sent messages and keep a record of your conversations. You send a message by filling out a 'form' on one page. You choose a team, then a category (from a list of 6 options). Then you fill in a subject, question and attach a document (optional).

### VA chatbot

**Purpose.** VA chatbot is a "resource to help you quickly find information about VA benefits and services. You won't communicate with an actual representative." You can use the VA chatbot to get information about VA benefits and services. However, it's only trained to answer general question about a few topics, like health care, sign in and prescriptions. They have taken content and re-written it in a conversational format, which is resource-intensive. So, this is part of the reason you can only ask about a few subjects right now. If you can't get help through chatbot, then you're encouraged to call a VA phone number, use Ask VA or explore other content online.

**Metrics.** From a glance, this team measures engagement rates, satisfaction rates, perceived requirements and content requests. The goal is to decrease time Veterans spend waiting and make it easier for them to self-serve, and decrease call center volume.

**Steps.** You shouldn't share "any personal information, such as your name, address or anything else that can be used to identify you." To start, it gives you examples of questions you can ask, like, 'What's the PACT Act?' or, 'What is my claim status?' Then, it tries to answer your question and shares a link to more information. Or, if it can't help, it asks you rephrase your question and choose from a list of  options. After it attempts to answer your question, it asks, 'Did that answer your question' and you can choose 'Yes' or 'No.'

### My HealtheVet (MHV) contact form

**Purpose.** My HealtheVet contact form is for when 'you need help, want to alert us to a concern, share information about a feature, or tell us how we're doing.' Your question should be 'related to the My HealtheVet website.' Before you use the contact form, it suggests answers to common questions. Then it says, 'If you need additional help, send us details using the Contact Us form.' This form is for non-urgent questions. Their goal is to reply within a day, or up to 3 business days. 

**Steps.** The form is on one page and includes 9 required fields, 4 optional fields and 2 conditional fields. You choose a topic, first, from a list of 8 options, including 'Other.' Then, you choose a category from a static list of 5 options, regardless of your topic. You receive an inquiry number after you submit the form and your response will be via email or phone, depending on what you choose.

### VET-HOME Inquiry

**Purpose.** VET-HOME's contact form is a way 'to schedule an environmental health registry evaluation or contact VET-HOME coordinators about other environmental exposure related inquiries.' If you choose certain topics at the start of the form, it will redirect you to information on VA.gov instead.

**Steps.** The form is on one page and includes 9 required fields, 11 optional fields and multiple conditional fields. First, you choose a topic from a list of 7 options. Depending on which topic you choose, you may need to give additional information. Depending on how you identify yourself, you may need to fill in additional or different fields. For example, if you're a VSO, it asks for your organization. After you submit the form, you receive a confirmation message. They respond within 5 business days. If you need a faster response, they suggest that you call or use the live chat on vethome.va.gov.

### Phone numbers

I reviewed the descriptions of 6 different VA phone lines. They all involve making a phone call and interacting with a representative or phone tree to receive help or complete a task.

- **MyVA411 main information line** is for Veterans and their support networks to contact VA using a 'main, toll-free number.' It connects you to a specific department or a VA call center agent.
- **VA benefits hotline** can help with finding out the status of a claim or appeal, updating your direct deposit information, requesting a letter, reporting a death or getting answers to other questions about VA benefits.
- **VA health benefits hotline** can help with enrolling in VA health care under TERA, paying a bill, asking about Community Care billing, enrolling in CHAMPVA or getting answers to other questions about VA health  care benefits.
- **GI Bill hotline** is for finding out how to verify your enrollment, updating your direct deposit information, checking payment information, or getting answers to other questions about VA education benefits and claims.
- **National Call Center for Homeless Veterans** is for 'Homeless Veterans to talk privately with a trained VA representative for free.' They connect people with programs, services and community resources and provide support.
- **My HealtheVet help desk** is for 'technical support for managing your health care online with My HealtheVet.'

## Insights

We can distinguish support channels by:
- **When:** whether they are asynchronous or synchronous*
- **What:** what they can support with
- **How:** how they provide support

|Channel|When|What|How|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|Ask VA|Asynchronous|You can ask about education, disability compensation, health care and many other VA related topics.|You submit a question or document and receive a reply within 10 business days.|
|MHV secure messaging|Asynchronous|You can communicate securely with your VA health care team.|You send a message and receive a reply within 3 business days.|
|MHV contact form|Asynchronous|You can ask questions or log issues related to the My HealtheVet website.|You submit a question or issue and receive a reply within 3 business days.|
|VET-HOME Inquiry|Asynchronous|You can schedule an environmental health registry evaluation or ask about environmental exposure related issues.|You schedule an evaluation or submit a question and receive a reply within 5 business days.|
|VA chatbot|Synchronous|You can ask general questions about some VA benefits and services.|You communicate with a bot and receive a link to information on VA.gov in real-time.|
|Phone calls|Synchronous|Depending on which phone number you call, you can ask about a range of VA related topics.|You communicate with a person and receive help in real-time.|

### Ask VA is similar to other asynchronous channels

> These include:
> - MHV secure messaging
> - MHV contact form
> - VET-HOME Inquiry

In comparison to other asynchronous channels, Ask VA:
- has the longest reply window
- is the least specific, in other words, provides support for the widest range of topics
- is described as a tool, rather than a contact form or a messaging system

#### Ask VA is more similar to MHV contact form and VET-HOME Inquiry

With all 3 of these support channels:
- you fill out a form and submit it
- you don't know who you're communicating with when you fill out the form
- you can ask a question without signing in

However, the authenticated experience of Ask VA makes it feel different to these other contact forms.

#### Ask VA is less similar to MHV secure messaging

Because with secure messaging:
- you're required to sign in and you need to be eligible to use it
- you know which health care team you're sending a message to
- it mimics the experience of email, where you can save drafts, delete messages, etc.

However, the dashboard experience of Ask VA is somewhat similar to MHV secure messaging.

### Ask VA is different to synchronous channels

> These include:
> - VA chatbot
> - Phone calls

Because Ask VA involves asynchronous communication, it's fairly different to VA chatbot or phone calls which deliver support in real-time. But, if Ask VA becomes more like a [Type 3 support experience](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/design/User%20research/02-2025%20Comparative%20analysis/Compare%20Ask%20VA%20to%20contact%20experiences%20on%20other%20websites.md#ask-va-could-be-more-similar-to-type-3), then it will become more similar to VA chatbot.

### Joining things up

Having multiple asynchronous support channels for different purposes is not inherently a bad or confusing thing. Even if VA's goal is to limit and merge these eventually.

But, the issue while multiple channels continue to exist, is that they're not joined up. There are very few moments where Ask VA is joined up with another support channels. This makes it difficult for people to understand and distinguish between support channels. And means people may use the wrong tool for their situation or preferences.

These paths currently exist:
- Ask VA links to the MyVA411 main information line or the GI Bill hotline on each page in the form
- Ask VA suggests using VA chatbot if you have a general question in order to get help more quickly
- VA chatbot suggests using Ask VA if you can't get help through chatbot

But we could design more paths, like:
- Ask VA could link to MHV secure messaging when a question is for a VA health care team
- MHV secure messaging could link to Ask VA for other questions that are not for your VA health care team
- Ask VA could link to MHV contact form when a question is related to the My HealtheVet website
- MHV contact form could link to Ask VA for other questions that are not related to the My HealtheVet website
- Ask VA could link to VET-HOME Inquiry when a question is related to environmental exposures
- VET-HOME Inquiry could link to Ask VA for other questions that are not related to environmental exposures

And if Ask VA becomes more like a [Type 3 support experience](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/design/User%20research/02-2025%20Comparative%20analysis/Compare%20Ask%20VA%20to%20contact%20experiences%20on%20other%20websites.md#ask-va-could-be-more-similar-to-type-3), then we should be intentional about the overlap between Ask VA and VA chatbot. There are different ways this overlap could be designed or managed, for example:
- You could start your question using VA chatbot, and if you don't receive help through the links provided, the chatbot could send you to Ask VA to submit a form
- You could start your question using VA chatbot, and if you don't receive help through the links provided, the chatbot could continue asking questions
- Or, Ask VA could learn from VA chatbot's model for surfacing information based on a question text and the Ask VA experience could remain more like a form or wizard
