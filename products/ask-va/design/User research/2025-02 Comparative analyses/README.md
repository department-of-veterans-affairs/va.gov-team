- [compare Ask VA to contact experiences on other websites](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/design/User%20research/2025-02%20Comparative%20analyses/Compare%20Ask%20VA%20to%20contact%20experiences%20on%20other%20websites.md)

## Background
Ask VA (AVA) lets Veterans, their family members and other submitters ask VA a question. In 2024, VA received over 500,000 questions through Ask VA. Ask VA includes a form, where submitters share their question with VA, and a dashboard, where submitters review past questions, read replies from VA and reply back.

After launching on VA.gov, we will focus on making quick, responsive improvements to the product while also bringing partners along on the journey. Our [product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/product/Product%20outline.md) includes more details about Ask VA and [Phase 2 initiatives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/product/Phase%202%3A%20Initiatives.md) describes our focus from January to March 2025.

## Research goals

When we compared Ask VA to contact experiences on other websites, our goals were to:
* Review how other websites provide help before moving to asynchronous communication
* Review how many fields are included on other websites' contact forms or messaging tools
* Review how other websites ask for information that lets them categorize or route an issue
* Review how being signed in (or not) changes the experience of contacting another organization online

When we compared Ask VA to other support channels on VA.gov, our goals were to:
* Review how support channels are described and distinguished from one another
* Review how teams measure the success of each support channel (where possible)
* Review the steps required to receive help from each support channel
