## Purpose

### Research goals

- Review how other websites provide help before asking someone to submit an inquiry
- Review how many fields are included on other websites' contact forms
- Review how other websites ask for information that lets them categorize or route an inquiry
- Review how being signed in (or not) changes the experience of contacting another organization online

### Outcome

This will help us articulate the things we like or don’t like and which direction to go with Ask VA. It will feed into product vision exercises we plan to do with partners.

### Methodology

1. Identify websites to compare.
2. Review the contact experience on the website.
3. Compare to Ask VA.

## Analysis

I reviewed the following contact experiences:
- [National Grid Contact Form](https://www.nationalgridus.com/NY-Home/Contact-Us/)
- [USAJOBS.gov Help Center](https://help.usajobs.gov/how-to)
- [Con Edison Contact Us](https://www.coned.com/en/contact-us)
- [RNID Contact Us](https://rnid.org.uk/about-us/contact-rnid/)
- [GOV.UK/Contact](https://www.gov.uk/contact)
- [Government of Canada Contact Us](https://www.canada.ca/en/contact.html)
- [Atlassian Contact Form](https://www.atlassian.com/company/contact)
- [Grammarly Contact Us](https://support.grammarly.com/hc/en-us/requests/new#/)

I reviewed each website and took notes in [Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1738276336649/31f5cc8b2eb56f67173d0318e5e38bda887b53bd). (Note: You may not have access to this Mural board.) After reviewing each website, I re-imagined Ask VA as if it worked like ___ contact experience.

### National Grid Contact Form

If Ask VA worked like National Grid, then:

- The VA.gov 'Contact us' page would be divided into tasks and/or channels. For example, book an appointment, submit a claim, email us, mail us, call us.
- If you needed general support, you would be directed to either Ask VA or FAQs.
- Ask VA would include two types of forms. For feedback or to get in touch. If you fill out a feedback form, you will not receive a response back. Otherwise, you can use the contact form and you will receive a response within 2 business days.
- The form includes 8 fields. It asks you to choose a category from 9 options. There are 0-7 topics within 2 of the categories.
- After you submit your question, you  receive a reference number. You will receive a response via email.
- Your contact experience would be the same whether you sign in or not. However, you do need to sign in to complete certain tasks, like paying a bill.

### USAJOBS.gov Help Center

If Ask VA worked like USAJOBS.gov, then:

- Benefits and other information pages on VA.gov would link to Ask VA.
- If you choose to contact VA.gov instead of find information or complete a task online, you will fill out a form (Ask VA) to request assistance by phone or email.
- The form includes 5 fields, 4 are required and 1 is optional (telephone). There is no categorization, in other words, you don't choose a category or topic.
- After you submit your question, you don't receive a reference number but it does tell you a ticket has been created. You should receive a response in 1 business day.
- Your contact experience would be the same whether you sign in or not. However, you do need to sign in to complete certain tasks, like apply for jobs.

### Con Edison Contact Us

If Ask VA worked like Con Edison, then:

- VA.gov would encourage you to either call a phone number, complete a task online or use a contact form (Ask VA).
- If you chose to fill out the contact form, a representative would contact you within 3 business days.
- The contact form would have 5-7 fields, because some are conditional.
- Ask VA, the contact form, would ask, 'What can we help you with today?' There would be about 6 options to choose from.
- After you submit your question, you don't receive a reference number. You should receive an email with the reply.
- Your contact experience would be the same whether you sign in or not. However, you do need to sign in to complete certain tasks, like pay a bill.

### RNID Contact us

If Ask VA worked like RNID, then:

- The VA.gov 'Contact us' page would first encourage you to use other tools to complete tasks online, before contacting VA.
- The 'Contact us' page would be categorized by channel. Ask us a question (Ask VA) would be described as an online form and deprioritized on the contact page.
- The contact form includes 5 fields. You can choose from 13 topics but choosing a topic is optional.
- You don't receive a reference number if you submit a contact form, this is different to a ticketing system. You will receive an email within 1 to 5 working days.
- There is no need or option to sign in to contact RNID or use their services.

### GOV.UK/Contact

If Ask VA worked like GOV.UK/Contact, then:

- VA.gov would have specific contact pages set up for each service. These would be different to hub or information pages.
- For example, there would be a contact page for 'Education benefits and work study' and a contact page for 'Life insurance.'
- The 'Life insurance' contact page would have links to information or tasks followed by contact information.
- People would be directed to get in touch via phone, mail, chatbot or complete a task online. Whenever possible, they would be directed to complete tasks.
- The only contact form would be for website issues, for example a link doesn't work on a page. You wouldn't need to sign in to use the form.
- The contact form would have 3 fields and you would have the option to receive a reply or not. You would not receive a reference number and it wouldn't be clear how long it takes to receive a reply.
- Some services may have their own contact tool which looks like a form, but it's not something you submit. For example, if NCA had a contact tool, the first question would ask, "How can we help you today?" with around 7 options. Your answer would direct you to a follow-up question or eventually a contact page for NCA that also includes tasks.
- Your contact experience would be the same whether you sign in or not. However, you do need to sign in to complete certain tasks, like file taxes.

### Government of Canada Contact Us

If Ask VA worked like Government of Canada, then:

- VA.gov would have specific contact pages set up for each service. These would be different to hub or information pages.
- For example, there would be a contact page for 'Education benefits and work study' and a contact page for 'Life insurance.'
- The 'Life insurance' contact page would have links to information or tasks followed by contact information.
- People would be directed to get in touch via phone, mail, chatbot or complete a task online. Whenever possible, they would be directed to complete tasks.
- There would also be an option to 'get general help' either 'by telephone' or 'by email.' If you choose by email, you're directed to Ask VA.
- Ask VA would be a contact form with 10 fields, 7 are required and 3 are optional. It has 9 categories with 1-6 topics in each category.
- Sometimes a category doesn't contain a topic. Instead, you receive a link to book an appointment, for example. The goal is to get you to complete a task, whenever possible.
- After you submit your question, you receive a reference number. You should receive a phone call within 2 business days.
- Your contact experience would be the same whether you sign in or not. However, you do need to sign in to complete certain tasks, like booking some appointments.

### Atlassian Contact Form

If Ask VA worked like Atlassian, then:

- The VA.gov 'Contact us' page would be categorized by what you need support with. For example, technical issues or health care. Ask VA would be linked under one or more of these headings.
- If you clicked Ask VA, you would be encouraged to sign in for a quicker support experience. You have the option to continue without signing in.
- Ask VA would ask for your email. Then, it would ask 'How can we help you?' and you can choose from 7 options. Conditional fields appear so you may need to choose a more specific topic, or you might skip this.
- As you go through the form, you would be given an automated solution – referred to as 'Your solution' – before you submit a request. 
- Depending on what your question is about, the solution may direct you to complete a task online, like read an FAQ or book an appointment.
- You could still choose to submit the request if their solution didn't help.
- If you choose to submit the request, you don't receive a reference number. It's unclear how long it will take to hear back over email.

### Grammarly Contact Form

If Ask VA worked like Grammarly, then:

- The VA.gov 'Contact us' page would be equivalent to Ask VA. There would be no other channels or ways to contact VA.
- You would be encouraged to sign in for a faster support experience. You have the option to continue without signing in.
- Ask VA would ask, 'What did you want to talk to us about?' and provide about 8 options. It may also ask you to choose a topic (up to 11 topics) or it skips this, depending on the category.
- It would use the category and topic to suggest helpful information, 'You may find this article helpful.'
- If you still need help (the article didn't help), you have the option to submit a form.
- If you choose to submit a form, conditional fields appear based on your responses (category, topic, etc.)
- You wouldn't receive a reference number if you carry through and submit the form. And it's unclear how long it will take for them to reply back to you via email.

## Insights

These 8 websites demonstrate 3 distinct types of contact experiences:

1. Submit a contact form for review
2. Find a contact page for an individual service
3. Answer questions and receive a recommendation

### Ask VA is Type 1

> 1: Submit a contact form for review
>
> A user fills out a form and submits it for review. An organization replies back later. The process is completely asynchronous.

Ask VA is a Type 1 experience. There are ways it is similar and different to other Type 1 services:

|Ask VA|Other Type 1 services|
|:--|:--|
|Ask VA is called an "online tool."|Most similar services would call Ask VA a "contact form" or refer to it as "emailing" VA.|
|Ask VA sends most responses via a dashboard that requires sign in, unless you don't sign in or request a phone call.|Most similar services send their response via email or phone call. And don't require sign in.|
|Ask VA responds within 7 business days.|Most similar services respond in 1 to 3 business days.|
|Ask VA includes 16 to 42 fields and some are optional.|Most similar services include around 6 fields and some are optional.|
|Ask VA asks for a category, topic and subtopic to categorize a question.|Most similar services just ask for a category and sometimes a topic, or neither.|

Examples of Type 1:
- [National Grid Contact Form](https://www.nationalgridus.com/NY-Home/Contact-Us/)
- [USAJOBS.gov Help Center](https://help.usajobs.gov/how-to)
- [Con Edison Contact Us](https://www.coned.com/en/contact-us)
- [RNID Contact Us](https://rnid.org.uk/about-us/contact-rnid/)

### Ask VA is very different to Type 2

> 2: Find a contact page for an individual service
>
> A user searches a 'Contact us' page to find a department to contact. They navigate to a department's contact page. They choose which channel to use.

Ask VA is very different to a Type 2 experience, but VA.gov has similarities with Type 2. If VA.gov worked **exactly** like a Type 2 experience, it would have have specific contact pages for each business line, which are **different** to hub or information pages. For example, there would be a contact page for 'Education benefits and work study' and a contact page for 'Life insurance.' 

We can still, however, compare this to the [right rail](https://design.va.gov/templates/hub#right-rail) VA.gov has on hub pages. Each hub page lists different ways to contact VA, including Ask VA and other channels.

The value of a Type 2 experience is that you spend time narrowing down who to contact and end up with **specific** contact information for a department. You expect a specific phone number for 'Education benefits and work study' when you're on [va.gov/education](https://www.va.gov/education/), for example. 

However, Ask VA is general. It's a way to contact all (or most) departments at VA. So, while you previously spent time narrowing down which department to contact, you now have to do this again within the Ask VA form. We can use our understanding of Type 2 services to design this seam more thoughtfully. For example, if you land on Ask VA from [va.gov/education](https://www.va.gov/education/), the form knows you are asking a question about education and filling out the form is more efficient.

Examples of Type 2:
- [GOV.UK/Contact](https://www.gov.uk/contact)
- [Government of Canada Contact Us](https://www.canada.ca/en/contact.html)

### Ask VA could be more similar to Type 3

> 3: Answer questions and receive a recommendation
>
> A user answers a question or a series of questions. They are interrupted with a recommendation to complete a task or read more information. If they don't reach resolution, they eventually submit a form.

Ask VA could operate more similarly to Type 3. Instead of the focus being on letting a user submit something, the focus would be on guiding a user through steps to complete a task.

If Ask VA worked like this, a user would start to fill out the form and be interrupted at various points with a recommendation. For example, if your question is about 'Survivor benefits,' then you could receive a recommendation to read an FAQ on 'How to apply for Survivor benefits' or 'Set up direct deposit.' If the recommendation doesn't help, you can continue to the next question. Until eventually reaching the end where you submit a form. Ask VA would require more intelligent branching and customization, moving away from a Type 1 experience.

Ask VA is currently, however, similar to Type 3 in the way that sign in works. Type 3 services to tend offer the option to sign in for a 'faster' experience. This is similar to Ask VA.

Examples of Type 3:
- [Atlassian Contact Form](https://www.atlassian.com/company/contact)
- [Grammarly Contact Us](https://support.grammarly.com/hc/en-us/requests/new#/)
