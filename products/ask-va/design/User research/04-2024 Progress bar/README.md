# About this research

## Study
[2024-04 Ask VA: Progress bar #529](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/529)

## Background
Ask VA (AVA) is an online portal that allows Veterans, caregivers and others to submit questions to VA and receive a secure response. Currently, AVA resides within a stand-alone Microsoft portal that is inconsistent with VA design standards, is not mobile-friendly, and has accessibility issues. 

We need to move AVA to VA.gov. It should be mobile friendly, accessible and easy to submit an issue and receive updates and information that results in a final resolution. Ultimately, we want AVA to feel part of a cohesive and user-centered approach to support. This [product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/products/ask-va-phase-1-product-outline.md) includes more details about the scope of Phase 1 of our work.

## Research goals
* Compare whether itâ€™s more effective to describe percentage complete or not describe progress at all
* Review whether submitters understand when to sign in or not
* Review whether submitters are clear on when to use Ask VA and how to start

## Recruitment
We will work with Perigean to recruit Veterans for this research.

## Date
This research will take place in April 2024.
