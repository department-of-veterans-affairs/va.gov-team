## Background

Ask VA (AVA) is an online portal that allows Veterans, caregivers and others to submit questions to VA and receive a secure response. Currently, AVA resides within a stand-alone Microsoft portal that is inconsistent with VA design standards, is not mobile-friendly, and has accessibility issues. 

We need to move AVA to VA.gov. It should be mobile friendly, accessible and easy to submit an issue and receive updates and information that results in a final resolution. Ultimately, we want AVA to feel part of a cohesive and user-centered approach to support. This [product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/products/ask-va-phase-1-product-outline.md) includes more details about the scope of Phase 1 of our work.

### OCTO priorities

This research supports the following OCTO FY24 priority:

* Better experiences: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.

### Veteran journey

Ask VA can support Veterans, their family members, and other submitters at many stages of the Veteran journey. They may use Ask VA when they’re separating through aging.

## Research goals

The key goals of this study are to:

* Compare whether it’s more effective to describe percentage complete or not describe progress at all
* Review whether submitters understand when to sign in or not
* Review whether submitters are clear on when to use Ask VA and how to start

### Outcome

This research will help us determine if and how we need to improve the design and content of Ask VA. We need to decide whether to use a progress indicator or not. If we use one, we need to test whether this version is effective or needs to be improved. This study will also inform future research objectives.

### Research questions

Compare whether it’s more effective to describe percentage complete or not describe progress at all:
* Do submitters notice the progress indicator?
* Is this progress indicator effective in describing how far along you are and how much is left?
* Do submitters notice when there's no progress indicator?
* In both scenarios, are submitters missing information (sections, chapters, etc.) to orient them?

Review whether submitters understand when to sign in or not:
* Is it clear when you need to sign in and why?
* If submitters decide not to sign in, why?
* If submitters are interrupted to sign in, do they understand why and what to do?
* Is it clear why information is pre-filled in the form?

Review whether submitters are clear on when to use Ask VA and how to start:
* Can submitters successfully start a new question from the authenticated dashboard?
* Do submitters understand not to use Ask VA in an emergency?
* Do submitters understand what to do in an emergency (instead of using Ask VA)?
* Do submitters notice any overlap between Ask VA and other VA tools?

### Hypotheses

1. Participants won't notice or point out the progress indicator without prompting.
2. Participants won't notice or point out the lack of a progress indicator without prompting.
3. Percentage will be enough information to motivate participants that they're making progress.
4. Participants will be able to start a new question from the authenticated dashboard without issue.
5. Participants will understand not to use Ask VA in emergencies.
6. If participants don't understand that they need to sign in at first, it will be clear once they're prompted to sign in.

## Methodology

This will be a moderated usability study conducted remotely over Zoom. We will use Figma prototypes with limited interactivity. We will present a scenario where the submitter has a question about their **education benefits**.

In half of the sessions, participants will use a prototype that includes a **new** progress indicator. In the other half, participants will use a prototype that **does not include** any progress indicator. We will compare both approaches.

We will let submitters **choose whether to sign in or not without guidance**. If they don't choose to sign in up front, they'll be prompted by a modal or alert to sign in after they choose their category and topic. In this scenario, they will need to sign in to continue. We will pre-fill certain parts of the form with mock data.

These are the main components and/or pages, we're testing:
- Progress bar
- Homepage (Unauthenticated)
- Dashboard without cards
- Sign in interruption

- Date and time of pilot session: April 17 at 12pm EST

### CAIA screen magnification pilot

Although we aren't recruiting any AT users for this study, we will run a pilot session with CAIA where they test the prototypes using screen magnification. This will inform future research we do in staging, where we'll include screen magnification as well as screen reader users. This pilot will happen after our research sessions with Veterans.

- CAIA ticket: [Screen Magnification Pilot with Figma Prototype #80535](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/80535)
- CAIA specialist: Jamie Klenetsky
- Date and time of pilot session: April 30 at 10:00am EST

## Research sessions

- Length of sessions: 1 hour
- Buffer between sessions: 30 minutes
- Maximum sessions per day: 4 sessions

### Availability

We will provide 20 time slots, with the aim to book 10 sessions.

**We’d also like to request that Perigean calls each participant to remind them about the session, in addition to emailing them. Please include the session time in each participant's respective time zone (from their address).**
