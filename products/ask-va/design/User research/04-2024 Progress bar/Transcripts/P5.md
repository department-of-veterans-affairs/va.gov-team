### Warm up

Tyler: Awesome. So are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio today.

P5: I am.

Tyler: So at this point. Do you have any questions for me?

P5: Not so far.

Tyler: Okay, cool. Well, let's go ahead and get started. Before we start to look at a prototype and gather some of your feedback, I'd love to just learn a little bit more about your experience with the Va. I'm curious how long you've been a Veteran?

P5: So transition of the army in 2018. So about 6 or so years.

Tyler: And in 2018 is that when you started kind of getting in touch with the VA?

P5: Yeah, kind of right after service.

Tyler: Awesome. Have you ever contacted the VA?

P5: Oh, yeah, pretty frequently.

Tyler: Yeah, how do you usually get in touch with the VA?

P5: I would say the majority of the time I call.

Tyler: And are you often calling like your healthcare providers?

P5: More often than not it's the healthcare system.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. Do you know, if you've ever contacted the VA online?

P5: Yes, I have, cause I know I've sent messages through the my healthevet before. And I wanna say that I use some online tools when I was doing some of the Gi bill stuff as well.

Tyler: Yeah, awesome. Well, I think that my healthevet's secure messaging tool is a little bit similar to what we'll talk through today. So you can always draw on that experience while we talk.

Tyler: Have you ever heard of Ask VA?

P5: That's not immediately ringing a bell.

Tyler: Okay. Awesome.

Tyler: Well, that's really helpful. Just to get an idea of your experience with the VA so far.

Tyler: So next, let's get ourselves set up with the prototype. So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna send you a link in the chat on Zoom. And then you can open this link on your computer.

Tyler: And once that's open on your side and it's loaded, just let me know.

P5: And it is loading.

Tyler: It's loading. Okay. Well, we'll give it a second to load. But what we're gonna do is have you share your screen. So have you shared your screen on zoom before?

P5: I have, yeah.

Tyler: Okay, cool. I'll give you a minute to go ahead and do that. And just give me a shout if you need it.

P5: Almost done, but.

Tyler: Okay. Almost down loading.

P5: Oh, it looks loaded! While I was talking cool.

Tyler: Perfect. Okay.

Tyler: Awesome. And I'm starting to see your screen. Let me just confirm.

Tyler: Perfect. So I'm seeing what you're seeing. It looks like it says, Ask VA. Okay. So we're not gonna click on anything yet. But I'm gonna give you a moment to look at this page and feel free to scroll around if you like. And as you're doing this, I'd love for you to tell me what you're noticing first?

### Homepage to sign in

P5: So it looks like I've gone through a contact us, which kind of makes sense on the contact us right up here, which is helpful. I appreciate when websites have that pretty easily.

Tyler: Yeah.

P5: Ask VA is nicely labeled here.  And then it looks like it gives examples of the types of questions. Your benefits or someone else's.

P5: And the signing in here now, too. Which I do have experience with the education benefits debt.

P5: All these kinda a lot of these different things...

P5: So I noticed that there is the availability to sign in for asking questions was presumably would get me more personalized responses.

P5: Will be asked for non urgent needs that makes sense.

P5: 7 business days to get a response. Okay, this sets the expectation upfront for for how long something might take.

P5: Okay, you always contact the Veterans Crisis Line. Their available.

P5: Yeah. And then it also has the options for the secure messaging for the health system. Specifically.

P5: Oh, there's a chatbot as well. Interesting. Okay.

P5: And then, of course, there's always the phone option, which I expect pretty much.

P5: And I assume when I see a reference number here, that this would be something that I would get after sending and a message, and then, if I want to check back on it, I assume that I would put that into the reference number to be able to find out the status.

P5: So yeah, that's kind of my initial thoughts on the page here.

Tyler: That was really helpful. I would love for you to keep kind of narrating what you're thinking as we keep going, cause that was useful for me. So you noticed a couple of things. You noticed that like you had gotten here from the contact page. You were talking a little bit about the types of questions you could ask.

Tyler: You noticed that there's an option to sign in. Does it feel like you need to sign in?

P5: Oh, I guess I didn't... You know it says sign in for best experience that tells me that. Yes, I can still do it without signing in. But I'm probably gonna have more success if I'm able to sign in.

P5: I do appreciate it says below that sign in for the best experience you need to sign in for these types of questions. So that kind of makes sense that you would need to sign in if you're looking for specific answers related to something that you've got going on, whether that's a particular claim or something like that.

P5: I was kinda curious... It says all questions about education benefits, work study and debt. One of the first thoughts that kind of came to me is like, would this be a venue that I would be asking questions about disability as well? Because I know that that's a big one for a lot of us, especially those who have recently transitioned. If they're trying to file any kind of disability claims, there's a lot of anxiety that comes up around the disability claims process, and it can be a long wait.

P5: I would wonder if this would be a venue for asking questions about [disability], or if there would be a more appropriate one, because when I scroll down below, it specifically says, secure messaging for the healthcare team. But it doesn't really address the disability which I feel like is one of the core services in addition to the healthcare and the education benefits.

Tyler: Yeah, that's such a good reflection. So you're reading this list of education benefits work study and debt and it's feeling like it's telling you that these are the things you can ask about. And then, if you want to ask about healthcare, you'll go to secure messaging which you have experience with. That makes a lot of sense. So it feels like if you wanted to ask about disability compensation or your disability rating, or anything like that, you might not be able to use this tool. That's really helpful. That makes a lot of sense.

P5: Yeah, it's unclear, and that's the thing for me is like, if I could get clear about the types of things that this would be useful and helpful for... Because I just wanna make sure that I know. And it might even be it might even be helpful to have it on like the contact us page. For these questions, use this tool for these questions, this tool whatever. But I just want clarity, so that I'm not wondering.

Tyler: Totally. That makes a lot of sense.

Tyler: And if you were gonna ask a question, let's say your question was, gonna be about education benefits. How long would you expect it to take for you to ask your question and get an answer?

P5: I mean, I would imagine that the asking the question kind of depends on how long it takes me to formulate the particular question. Hopefully, I've already got it in mind. I wouldn't expect it to take more than like 5, maybe 10 minutes.

P5: And then, you know, I saw the expectation up to 7 business days. So you know, I'm hoping that it's by the end of the week if I'm asking this on a Monday, but I recognize that it might bleed into the following week.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. And that's helpful that you noticed the 7 business days.

Tyler: Awesome, well for the rest of our conversation today, we're gonna pretend like you need to ask the VA a question. And we're gonna say you'd want to learn whether you're eligible for post 9/11 GI Bill benefits. I think you already mentioned the GI Bill right? So I think you're familiar with that?

P5: Yeah.

Tyler: Cool. So for the benefit of everyone on the call on the post 911 GI Bill helps you pay for school or job training, and people who served on active duty after September 10th, 2001 might qualify for these education benefits.

Tyler: So I'll remind you of this scenario as we go along. But we'll kind of put ourselves in that headspace for the rest of the session. That's what we're here to do. We're here to ask a question. Okay?

Tyler: And so without clicking anything. Yet can you tell me what you would think to do first, to ask your question?

P5: I feel like I'm get a better answer if I was to click sign in or create an account as opposed to continue without signing in.

Tyler: Why would it be better? Or how would it be better?

P5: You know, it specifically up here notes personal questions about your benefits or someone else's benefits. And to me, that indicates that it's going to be a response more tailored to my experience, and I hope that in creating an account and then subsequently signing in that there would be somebody that's answering the question [that] would have access to some of the specifics of my situation, so that they could give me a more tailored answer as opposed to, if I was to ask a general question without signing in.

Tyler: That makes a lot of sense. So it'll be more personalized. They'll maybe have more access to like, who you are and be able to help you.

P5: That'd be my hope.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Well let's go ahead and click sign in, because that's what it sounds like you would you would choose to do so.

Tyler: And so we're on this page. Now, does this look familiar to you?

P5: Oh, very much so.

Tyler: And so for today, we're not actually gonna have you sign into an account.

P5: Okay.

Tyler: But we're gonna pretend like we did. So let's pretend like we clicked on login.gov, and we went and put in our email address and our password. And we did the whole thing. And now we're signed in. Okay.

### Through to submission

P5: Okay. Cool.

Tyler: So tell me, describe this page to me. What are we looking at now?

P5: So I've signed in now. So I assume this is like the sign in look of the page. My name is Hector for the session. So that's nice to know. I figured that there would be – on most websites that I log into, there's gonna be some indication, typically in the top right corner that I'm logged in. So that's nice to see.

P5: I see that there is a button to ask a new question. I was kind of wondering before I clicked on it...

P5: It does say your questions, and I figured that there should be some way to check back on previous questions, and I'm glad to see that is the case.

P5: I'm also really curious. What's under this little menu? Only a use Ask VA for non urgent questions. Just looking at it. I assume that it would give me additional information about the types of information that this service might be able to provide.

Tyler: Let's go ahead and click on that. And we'll see if it meets your expectation there. Is this what you were expecting or is it different?

P5: It's not exactly what I was expecting. I mean, it kind of makes sense. Only use Ask VA for non urgent questions, and then it is talking about, you know, if you're in crisis or having thoughts of suicide, connect with the Veterans Crisis Line, which is the exact same thing I see on every website. And 911 if your life or health is in danger.

P5: I do wonder whether it might be beneficial to have maybe one additional dropdown menu that just has specifics about the types of information that you might be able to get from this type of platform.

P5: Because, you know, now that I've clicked [the emergency accordion], and I see the information that's there, it totally makes sense the information there. It's just kind of further explaining the whole non urgent questions only thing.

P5: I'd still like to have clarity about what the platform is going to be useful for.

Tyler: Yeah, it still feels like it...

P5: Before I'm waiting 7 business days and getting frustrated after all, that if for whatever reason I wasn't in the right place.

Tyler: Yeah, that totally makes sense. I feel like on both this page and the first page you were kind of like, I feel like, I'm sort of guessing what I can ask about, and also kinda like, what's the best... why I should use this tool exactly. That makes a lot of sense. If, you know, we're in this scenario where you wanna ask this question, can you show me how you would start that process?

P5: Yeah, I would try to hit the hyperlink that says ask a new question.

Tyler: Awesome. Let's go ahead and do that when you're ready.

P5: So we come into a new question. And it shows new question right here [in the breadcrumb] which makes sense. Get answers to your questions about the benefits and services.

P5: Category. Okay. I'm curious what the categories are, because that might have some of the information that I'm looking for on the previous screen.

P5: Can I click it?

Tyler: Yes, you can.

P5: Cool.

P5: Aha! It does have disability compensation in here.

P5: It has a lot of categories. My goodness, there's a lot of categories. Oh, my word. Lot of categories.

Tyler: Tell me how you're feeling about that, that it's a lot of categories.

P5: It feels a little bit overwhelming. It's more than I expected.

P5: I think that it's probably not a bad thing to be able to have different places to be able to send things but this feels a little overwhelming. This feels like a lot of information I'm having to search through and try to find what I'm looking for.

P5: Like the ones that I mentioned initially are towards the top education, disability, healthcare, which I can appreciate.

P5: But it's a lot, and I wonder if there's any way to simplify it if there's any way to. I know on some websites they're able to have, if you start typing letters it'll pull up search results in the menu, which might kind of simplify the process. Although you would have to get the nomenclature right for the specific category.

P5: Yeah, just a lot of options.

Tyler: For sure. So on the one hand, it was like, okay, cool. Now I kinda know what I can ask about, which includes disability compensation. But also this is so much for me to read through. And there's too many options. That makes a lot of sense to me.

Tyler: In this scenario, can you show me what you would choose?

P5: yes, I just remembered...

P5: I'm currently trying to get the post 9/11 GI Bill. Okay, probably education benefits and work study which conveniently, for the particular question I have today is right there.

Tyler: Right. But in another scenario, where maybe you need to ask about life insurance, you would have to read through quite a bit more?

P5: Yeah.

Tyler: That makes sense. Well let's go and click education benefits.

Tyler: And then we can go on to the next page.

P5: Which I assume would be clicking continue.

Tyler: Yes.

P5: Alright. So I am 10% complete. Woo.

P5: Oh, good lord. There's another dropdown.

P5: Alright. Select the topic that best describes your question. Let's select the topic. And oh my, okay, yeah, there's plenty of stuff. Okay.

Tyler: Are you feeling a similar reaction to seeing this dropdown here?

P5: Yeah, it's just, it's a lot of stuff. And I would imagine that on the backend it probably simplifies answering the question. It probably makes getting an answer quicker. But again, it does feel like kind of a lot.

P5: You know, at least at a moment's glance. I can find post 9/11 GI Bill, Chapter 33, without too much trouble. But it's a lot of options. After I just got through another dropdown menu.

P5: There was so many options.

Tyler: Yeah, so it's a lot of options. And then it's another thing where you have to read through a lot of options. On the last page you talked about how education benefits and healthcare and disability were all at the top, and those are kind of like key things Veterans would be looking for. On this page, it's organized a little bit differently.

Tyler: How does that feel?

P5: I appreciate it, and it's different from what I was just looking at in the last menu. So that in itself is kind of interesting to go from organized by popularity of use to alphabetical.

P5: Well, it's just kind of interesting to think about the Center for Women Veterans and the Center for Minority Veterans being at the bottom, and that... you don't want that to be a comment on how useful or important those centers are because we already have issues within women and minority Veteran communities.

P5: But if I know that they're both alphabetical, I might be looking for certain keywords, and that might be useful in itself.

Tyler: Yeah.

P5: Because as soon as I recognize that hey, this is alphabetical. Start looking for the P. For Post 9/11, then I can find it.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

P5: There's an argument to be made in both directions.

Tyler: Yeah, I can see that.

Tyler: Well, you found Post-9/11 GI Bill, despite the overwhelming list, so let's go ahead, and click on that one. And then we'll continue through to the next page.

P5: So let's see what's on the next page.

P5: Okay, this makes sense. I mean, I think this is a useful question. In this case we would say, I'm the veteran. I appreciate that there is, I'm a family member of the Veteran and then I'm connected to the Veteran through my work.

P5: Yeah, you could just ask a question as... Not put that or anything anyway.

P5: So this one seems pretty simple. I don't really have a tremendous amount of thoughts.

Tyler: Yeah. Cool. Well, that makes sense. Let's go ahead and continue.

P5: Are you a GI bill beneficiary? Okay, I appreciate that there's an I'm not sure option here.

P5: Could be part of the question...

P5: For the purposes of this exercise, Am I sure or I'm not sure. What am I thinking?

Tyler: That's a good question. Well, let's say you're someone who wants to find out if they're eligible for GI Bill benefits. How do you feel like you'd respond to this question?

P5: You know it sounds like I'm not sure, so I would probably click I'm not sure. And then continue.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense.

Tyler: Let's go ahead and click no, just for the purpose of the prototype, because that's what it wants us to click, but that makes sense to me. Why you would choose, I'm not sure.

Tyler: And then we'll continue.

Tyler: So this one is not gonna let you click. But you can just talk me through what you'd be thinking.

P5: Okay, I mean, I've seen this kind of thing before. It seems pretty self explanatory. I would hope that it would be alphabetical, because every other list of states that I've ever seen is alphabetical.

P5: I know I'm gonna be [near] the bottom because I'm in [State].

P5: You know, it makes sense, the state that the schools in, and then the state that I have residency in. I don't know if it would be helpful, just in case there's any question to have just a brief explanation at the bottom of School State, like state that the school is in, and then Residency State, state in which you currently reside.

P5: You know. I think, that that might be helpful for somebody that may not be familiar with the concept of Residency as it relates to school.

P5: So that's just kind of the main thought that I have as regards this page.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. And in this case, do you have to give both school State and Residency state?

P5: That's a good question. On second thought, looking at it...

P5: I guess the school state is required and residency state is not necessarily. But I feel like I should give it, even if it's not required.

P5: It feels like I should give the Residency State just because there is a dropdown menu there, and I'm like, well, why is it there? If I'm not supposed to put it.

Tyler: Right. So you might just like cover all your bases. And put in both yeah, that makes sense.

P5: Yeah.

Tyler: Alright. Well, let's pretend like you open these and you put in [State], probably, and we'll click continue.

P5: Aha! And that was a decent number of clicks to get to your question.

Tyler: Okay, so does it feel like you've been waiting for this page.

P5: Longer than I might have hoped.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: And now we're here, tell me, kind of like, describe to me, how what you would be doing on this page.

P5: Yeah, I mean, you know, I would probably start top to bottom, like I deal with most pages. I would go in here. I would click in the little box text box below. Subject. Type in inquiring about GI Bill status or something like that. And then what's your question?  I would like to find out if I'm eligible for Post 9/11 GI Bill benefits.

P5: And then I see that there is select files to upload. In this particular case, I can't imagine that I would have any specific files to upload, but it's nice to know if I did have something, some kind of supporting documentation that I think would be useful.

P5: That's probably, you know. It seems like it would be pretty simple to get that in there. I do appreciate that there is the option to drag and file here, because I like having that option. It makes a little bit easier to put to attach files.

Tyler: For sure. Cool. That makes sense that felt pretty straightforward. Like it took a while to get to this page maybe, but in terms of this page itself. It feels like it's pretty straightforward.

P5: Yeah.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense alright. Well, we'll pretend, like we typed in like something about post 9/11 GI bill benefits. And your questions about your eligibility and we'll just continue to the next page.

Tyler: And so you noticed this early on. But let's pretend like instead of it, saying, Hector throughout this. It says [P5], and it's all your information here.

P5: Got it.

Tyler: And so why is this information filled in already?

P5: I would assume that this information would be filled in already... Oh, and it actually gets an explanation right here at the top. We pre-filled some of your information from your account, and that's what I would have figured. And so some of this information is gonna already be filled out. It is kind of cool that it offers the opportunity to correct anything if needed.

P5: Social security...

P5: I didn't necessarily expect to have additional information to fill out after submitting my question. So it does feel a little odd that now I'm giving this information. I also understand that it might be useful information to give, but I kind of wonder whether it might be easier to have this on the front end as opposed to after I've already asked the question, and I feel like I'm done.

P5: And why am I having to continue clicking and moving along like, why didn't I just provide this at the beginning.

Tyler: That makes sense.

P5: Like, even before I selected the category and everything I feel like it would be useful to just like, Okay, sign in. Ask a question, tell us about yourself. Okay, fine, you know. I'll make sure to have that information, and then I'll move through the question process because it just feels really odd. On the back end.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

Tyler: So it feels kind of out of place and like it's also just surprising anything came out came after your question. But it made sense to you why, the information is pre filled, and you also notice that you are able to edit it.

Tyler: Cool. Well, let's go to the next page. Just pretend like you reviewed it, and everything looked good.

Tyler: Then, we're on this page. And again, let's pretend like, this is your information. So I want us to imagine, like, let's say, you changed your phone number. You got a new phone number. And you realize that actually, this is your old phone number, and you need to change it.

Tyler: How would you change that here? Can you just talk me through that.

P5: Yeah, I would assume that I should be able to, like on most websites, double click on the text box that has the phone number in it and type over it or, you know, hit backspace or something like that. And it should allow me to just simply update that information.

P5: I do question why this is on a separate page from all of my information from the last page. It's like a little bit of stuff. Why did I have a whole other click to get to the contact information. And why wasn't it just kind of appended to the bottom of the last one?

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. It feels like it could have all been on one page. And if you did click in there, and you, you added your phone number, would you... Do you feel like your phone number would get updated anywhere else in your VA ecosystem?

P5: Really unclear. I would honestly have no idea what to think. I think maybe not. But there's nothing kind of indicating to me that if I update my information here, it will update anywhere else. So probably not.

Tyler: Right. Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: So it's pretty unclear. And you would be basically guessing. Yeah, that that's totally fair. Alright. Well, we'll continue on to the next screen. We'll say we, we fix the phone number. We're good to go.

P5: Huh. Hmm...

Tyler: Yeah. So talk me through that reaction.

P5: This seems to be, this kind of appended at the end. I'm just like, okay.

P5: I would have expected this is again something I would have expected before the question itself. Why are you contacting us today? I'd like to make a compliment. I'd like to leave a complaint. I'd like to do this or do that.

P5: That would be information that might be useful for somebody to know upfront, so that they can direct the question, complaint, you know, compliment whatever. But it feels really awkward right here at the end. And I just you know, I went through all this stuff to get to my question. Then I'm having to do my demographic kind of information. Then I'm having to do my contact information. And now it's asking me why I contacted them. Hmm.

Tyler: Yeah, feels pretty out of a place. And it sounds like, you're thinking, this question might help route your inquiry to the right place right depending on if it's a complaint or whatever.

Tyler: Okay, well, let's choose I had a question. And we'll just continue.

P5: Yeah, also, it's just interesting to me that this is even a question, because it's Ask VA, so presumably I had a question. I wouldn't even expect any of the rest of these to necessarily be an option. So it's just very odd.

P5: But I'll go ahead...

Tyler: I can totally understand that.

Tyler: Awesome. So we've hit, continue, and then talk me through this page.

P5: So review and submit. So this kind of makes sense. You know, a review page. This I can understand, having, like right after the question. You're reviewing all your stuff. You wanna make sure that everything was right.

P5: You are only able to edit some answers on this page you may need to return to an earlier page in the form to edit some answers. I would assume that if I click edit and I need to go back to another page that it would automatically take me back to the previous page. Otherwise I'm like, how do I get there?

P5: But it looks like I should be able to click on the little plus sign to verify that my question is exactly what I wanna ask. Then I'm able to check my personal information here to make sure that this is all correct.

P5: And then my contact information. So, yeah, so this is, this screen seems relatively simple.

P5: I don't know if only one of them was expanded for any particular reason, I would have expected all of it to be expanded if I initially click over here, just so that I can verify everything all at once. And then I can, you know, minimize as I'm done. 

P5: But I don't have any particular concerns about this page, because this seems pretty standard as far as making sure that everything is is written out correctly, and then I can just fix anything that needs fixing before actually. And I assume, yes, down here it does have a submit button, and I can just click that and be done.

Tyler: Perfect. Okay, that makes sense. You described the page really well to me, and like kind of your expectations for it. It sounds like having both accordions open, would have made more sense for you, and it doesn't really make sense that one is closed. I totally understand that. So let's say you reviewed it, and now we're ready to submit your question, and you've already found that button, so you can go ahead and click on that.

Tyler: I'll give you a minute to read this, and and let me know what this page is telling you.

P5: Yeah, so, initially the green, your question was submitted successfully. That just warms my heart. I got it through.

P5: And then, you know. Thank you for submitting a question to the US Department of Veterans Affairs. That's pretty standard. I got it. Your reference number that's nice to have you know I can if I really want to write it down if I want to copy it down somewhere.

P5: I've got the reference number. I noticed at the beginning that there was a place to look up if I don't want to log in. Check the status of the question.

P5: As I would expect, there is an expectation for an email confirmation. Because typically, that would probably be how I would expect to get something is I would have the confirmation number, and maybe just a copy of the question I submitted in my email.

P5: And then it just reminds me that you should receive a reply by email within 7 business days. If we need more information, answer your question. We'll contact you. Okay, got it. So that, yeah, that that looks pretty much like what I would expect to see on this one.

Tyler: Yeah, that that's helpful. And it sounds like you understood, like you can use your reference number in that search that you found at the very beginning. Otherwise you could sign in and you'd see your question.

Tyler: It sounds like it's clear on like how the VA is gonna follow up with you next...

Tyler: So that's great. So we've reached the end of our prototype. So you can actually stop sharing your screen if you prefer, and then we still have a little bit of time to just kind of chat.

### Cool down

Tyler: So I'd love to spend a little bit of time just reflecting. What did you think of that process? Is there anything that you liked about it?

P5: Let's see anything, in particular...

P5: I appreciate that there is a place to be able to ask questions. And it seems like you're able to ask questions on a pretty broad range of topics there, which is cool.

P5: I'm able to sign in so I can get a more personalized answer, which, you know, seems relatively simple. So yeah, I think it's a cool tool, and as it's hopefully simplified, you know, it could prove to be a nice way to be able to contact without having to sit on the phone for an hour to try to call in and ask a question of somebody. That can be really tough.

Tyler: Yeah, totally. That makes sense. So you like, just in general like that, this tool could be available. And obviously, there's ways it could simplify but and we talked about some of those as we went along. How about like how long the process felt? So while you were filling up the form. Did you feel like you understood how much longer you had left?

P5: Kind of, but it went on longer than I expected.

Tyler: And that was based on kind of like, I remember at the beginning asking, you like, how long you think this would take. And you're like, probably about 5 min. And was that kind of what you were basing it on? You're like this is starting to take longer than what I thought.

P5: It had a lot more questions than I was expecting. And you know, I understand that there's probably, you know, sorting and things that will make it get to the right place and help it get to where it needs to be, but kind of the way that it's structured, especially as I mentioned earlier, the fact that they were like at least 3 or 4 more screens, after I have already put the question in just felt really odd.

Tyler: Yeah, yeah. The order of the form came up a few times between, like, where the question was and then why isn't, my personal information like all the way up front. And obviously that last question was a little kind of through us off to that makes a lot of sense. Do you feel like, while you were going through the form, there was anything that was showing you your progress?

P5: I mean. There was the little bar at the top at. But I'm not a huge fan of those. It kind of gives me a broad idea, but I don't know how much percent each page is. Sometimes it kind of really gives me an indication of where I'm at. But sometimes it really doesn't. I wonder if it might be more helpful to say page x of x. Or something like that, where it has a more concrete meaning as opposed to percentages which, you know, I was at 95% on that last question. I'm like, we just added a 5. Where did the 5 come from?

P5: Like, what in the world?

Tyler: Right. That makes sense. So because, like the percentages aren't, you know, one for one with each page, it doesn't mean a whole lot. Just kind of shows you moving forward. Do you feel like you need to know that you're moving forward in the form like is it? Is the the progress bar useful at all, or it's kind of like unnecessary?

P5: I think, having some indication of progress would be helpful, because I want the expectation of how long it's going to take, because I think if there's no indication, I'm going to get frustrated because it already is more screens than I was expecting to go through on this. So, having some way to know that all right, I've got X number of pages or something to go is gonna be helpful for me, because I know that I am moving towards the end, and I'm not just. Oh, my goodness, there's another page! Oh, my goodness! There's another page.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense, especially when you start to feel like you're not expecting the question. So it's hard for you to guess how much longer. It will be yeah, I get that. I'm curious like, what if something came up while you were filling out the form like you had to take a phone call, for example.

Tyler: Would you be able to save your question and come back to it later?

P5: It's a good question. And I feel like there was something on the bottom of the page, and I can't remember now but... For me if I'm just thinking about it without remembering exactly what it says on the page. For me it's like a 50/50, so I lean towards probably not.

Tyler: That makes sense. So you kind of remembered something at the bottom of the page that talked about saving your question. But without a clear like, without looking at the page, you would just be guessing. That makes sense.

Tyler: Let's say that you could save it. So it did say, you know, you can finish this question later. Where would you come back like in your next time, sitting down at your computer? Where would you go back to find that unfinished question?

P5: Yeah, I would hope that I would be able to go to that initial page sign in, and then I should be able to find questions in progress, or something simple that allows me to see, hey, you know you have this one that is unfinished if you'd like to complete it.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: Well, I think you've answered all my questions, it's been such a helpful conversation.

Tyler: I do wanna, leave some space in case you have any questions for me. It might be about like what we've been talking about in this session, or kind of what our team's working on, or whatever.

P5: I don't think I have any in particular.

Tyler: Okay, awesome.

Tyler: Well, thank you so much for your time. We really appreciate it. It's really helpful to get feedback from folks who will use these tools, and I think you give us a lot to think about. So I really appreciate it.

Tyler: Perigean, they're the folks who set up this session. They're gonna send you a thank you not afterwards, and with some information you can pass on to other Veterans if you'd like and if you have any questions you can just reach out to them.

Tyler: But I think that's it for me. I hope you have a lovely rest of your day.

P5: Likewise I appreciate it.

Tyler: Awesome. See you later.

P5: Alright! Take care! Bye, bye.

Tyler: Bye!
