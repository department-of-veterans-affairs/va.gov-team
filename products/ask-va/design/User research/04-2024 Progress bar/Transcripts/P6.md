### Warm up

Tyler: So are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio today?

> P6: Absolutely.

Tyler: Perfect. Thank you. So we've went through all that information. At this point, do you have any questions for me?

> P6: Nope.

Tyler: Okay. And have you done one of these research sessions with the VA before?

> P6: No, I haven't.

Tyler: Okay, awesome. Well, welcome. We really appreciate you doing this. So before we get started and start looking at that prototype that I mentioned. I'd just love to learn a little bit more about your experience with the VA. I'm curious how long you've been a Veteran?

> P6: You mean completely out of the service?

Tyler: Yeah.

> P6: So that's been about 5 years now. Between active duty and reserves. I did a total of 28 years with the Navy.

Tyler: Wow, okay. And so, when you first got out of service, about 5 years ago, did you start interacting with the VA right away?

> P6: Yeah, yeah, I started, I got a general practitioner there. And actually, that's where I get all my care.

Tyler: Okay, awesome. When you started out, I'm sure you were getting information from the Navy, but did you ever ever contact the VA yourself?

> P6: No, other than to just get affiliated with the local VA here at the hospital. So other than that, no.

Tyler: Yeah, have you went on any VA websites?

> P6: Oh, yeah, VA.gov.

Tyler: Cool. And did you ever try contacting the VA online, or did you call up your local medical center? How'd you get in touch?

> P6: I went there initially to become active with them. But I've done the you know, the VA website to contact the VA. And also to contact my health provider with, you know my healthevet.

Tyler: Okay, cool.

Tyler: So when you're doing that through my healthevet, are you using secure messaging where you can chat to your doctor?

> P6: Yeah. Although I have to go to a different browser than I'm used to, because it doesn't seem that they use Firefox. Well, it just keeps re-looping. So I have to use Chrome.

Tyler: Oh, okay. Interesting. And have you ever heard of something called Ask VA or Ava?

> P6: It sounds familiar, but I can't speak specifically on it.

Tyler: Yeah, no worries. Well, we're gonna talk a little bit more about that today. But that's helpful to get an idea of your experience with the VA so far.

Tyler: So what we'll do now is we're gonna get you set up with a prototype. So it's always a little tricky on our phone. So we'll just have to be a little patient. But what I'm gonna do is send you a link in the chat on zoom. I'll send it right now and then it's gonna pop up on your screen, and if you can open that for me. Let me know once you've got that open.

> P6: Alright.

> P6: Slowly opening. Alright, that's open!

Tyler: Alright. So now that it's open, we're gonna have you share your screen on Zoom. Have you done that before on your phone?

> P6: Not necessarily.

Tyler: Yeah, that's okay. So what we'll do is come back to the Zoom window. So come back to where you can see my face. And then once you're there, usually at the top or at the bottom you're gonna see something that says share screen, or like start broadcasting. Are you seeing anything that looks like that?

> P6: At the bottom. Let me see. Here.

Tyler: Sure. Yeah, that might. That might be the one. And then what are you seeing when you click on that?

> P6: So start broadcasting.

Tyler: Okay, I think that's the one, perfect. So now I'm seeing your screen where it says screen broadcast. So if you can go back to that link that you just opened up that said Ask VA.

Tyler: Yeah, perfect, awesome.

Tyler: And then, if you want to, you can just, swipe my face away. Since it's kinda in the way. So yeah, you can put it up top or, yeah, that's perfect awesome.

Tyler: Alright. So now I'm not able to see your face, which is totally fine, but that might mean you have to be a little bit more verbal so I know you're there.

> P6: Yeah.

### Homepage to sign in

Tyler: So we're set up on here. We're not gonna click on anything yet, but you are welcome to scroll around. And as you're doing that I'd love for you to tell me what you're noticing first.

> P6: Well, I first thing I noticed, obviously, is that they're requiring you to sign in if you want the best experience.

> P6: And then it looks pretty much the same as the other ones.

> P6: I see it's not urgent. So it's obviously not anything that you have to expect an answer for right away.

> P6: I see that you have the 911. Did you guys ever think about putting the 988 there as well? Unless I missed it.

Tyler: That's a good thought.

> P6: Especially, because the first one you call out, I see, is the suicide. So, other than that, looks like your standard VA website, same colors, same kind of bold and not bold.

Tyler: Yeah. So when you said like, this, looks like the other ones, are you talking about other VA websites?

> P6: Yeah, yeah, it looks like where I go to sign in for, like my healthevet, or if you have to do anything like check your payments, or you know anything like that.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. And what's this page about specifically. Like it's saying that you can sign in...

> P6: It sounds like it. Well, looks like it's just if you want to get more information about just general VA benefits. And maybe education benefits or just general questions that you may have about the VA.

Tyler: Yeah. Cool that that makes sense to me.

Tyler: And if you were gonna ask the VA a question using this website, how long would you expect it to take for you to ask your question, and then for the VA to reply to you.

> P6: Well I see that it takes 7 days. But I know that varies. If I compare it to like the my healthevet I usually get answers within, you know, 2 or 3 days depending on, you know, if it's an urgent one or not. So I'm assuming that it would be the 7 days. But I also have read many places how the VA is under staffed. So I would say that, just my personal opinion, if that's a if that's a valid 7 business days, then that then that's good.

> P6: I think I think sometimes people don't key in on the business days. And I think sometimes that frustrates people or could frustrate people.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense

Tyler: Awesome. So for the rest of our conversation today, we're gonna pretend like, you need to ask the VA a question.

Tyler: So we're gonna pretend, like, you want to learn whether you're eligible for post 9 11 GI Bill benefits. Are you familiar with the GI bill?

> P6: Yes, I'm actually using it now.

Tyler: Okay, awesome. So you'll be a little bit hypothetical with me. But we're gonna pretend like you have not applied yet. And so you don't know if you're eligible yet, and that's why you've come here today. You wanna figure out if you're eligible. Okay.

> P6: Gotcha.

Tyler: And I'll remind you this scenario as we go along. So without clicking anything yet can you just tell me what you would do first if you wanted to ask the VA if you were eligible.

> P6: Well I know from my experience it's usually better if you have an account. So I would actually sign into an account or create account if I didn't have one because I know that way, you're gonna get more specific response usually. And that way you have a place that you can go to, should you wanna see that same response again.

Tyler: Okay, yeah, that's really helpful. So you'll get a more specific response and be able to kind of like track or keep that response somewhere saved.

> P6: Right. So you don't have to try to save a screenshot, or something of that nature to refer back to it.

Tyler: Right. Totally. Okay, cool. So let's go ahead and click on sign in cause it sounds like that's what you'd probably do.

> P6: Okay.

Tyler: And then on this screen, we're not gonna click anything yet. Does this look familiar to you?

> P6: Yup, the usual yeah.

Tyler:  Okay, cool. So what we're gonna do is we're not actually gonna have you sign in we're just gonna pretend like you're signing in. So we're gonna click on login.gov, and just imagine that we put in your username and your password. And now we're signed in.

### Through to submission

Tyler: So tell me what we're looking at now.

> P6: This looks like where you would ask your question.

> P6: And again, I like that it's called out that it's for non urgent.

> P6: And again, dropdown.

Tyler: Cool so pretty quickly. You realize, like this is where you can start to ask your question. It's not for urgent questions... If you scroll down a little bit further. What is that section there? What's that for?

> P6: Well, this would be if I've submitted a question looking for a response.

Tyler: Okay. Cool. So we'll pretend, like you're ready to start your question. You've got this question about the GI bill and go ahead and show me what you would do next.

> P6: So I would click, ask a new question.

> P6: Search through. Yeah, I'm a scanner. So I would check the whole thing just in case. I see that it's up there on the top, but I always like to try to check and see if there's something else. Maybe something that said 9/11 GI Bill... The education benefits.

Tyler: Okay, perfect. So you'd have a scan. Make sure you weren't missing anything else. And then you would pretty quickly figure out which one. Well, we can continue on to the next page. And then tell me about this page.

> P6: Now I think this – without selecting it – I'm sure that it breaks down again different levels of the GI bill and other benefits like, you know, the licensing that they have or different career paths that you can do. I see work study, and I see the Montgomery GI Bill and the post-9/11 GI Bill there.

Tyler: cool. Okay, so you have some familiar familiarity, obviously with the VA so you kinda know what you're looking for and you found that post 9/11 GI bill benefits.

Tyler: Awesome. Anything else you want to tell me about this page?

> P6: No, it looks like it does save your progress, which I see there, and that you, if something happens or I wanted to check further about something, I could always come back and finish the question, which is a nice feature.

Tyler: Yeah, if you were, gonna do that. Let's say you like, we're gonna finish the question later. When you went, you know, you went off for the day, and you came back at night, and you're like, I'm ready to finish my question. How would you find that unfinished question? Where would it be?

> P6: It looked like If I remember right, it would be on that same first page where I logged in. Or after I logged in.

Tyler: Yeah... Where it said your questions?

> P6: Right, your questions.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, let's go ahead and continue.

Tyler: Alright. And what are we seeing here.

> P6: This is describing who you are. Are you the veteran? Are you family member, or are you a school? I would be I'm the Veteran.

Tyler: Yeah, that seems pretty straightforward. So go ahead and continue when you're ready.

> P6: Alright. And then again, it's asking me if I'm a Veteran of what on the previous screen... 

> P6: Then it also asked me am I a beneficiary of it. I guess this is where, if I'm trying to find out whether I am a beneficiary, if we're going with the scenario I would be putting, I'm not sure.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So in this scenario, where you are trying to figure out, if you're eligible, you would say, I'm not sure, yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: So forgive me, but we're gonna click on no. That's what the prototype wants us to do, and then we'll go ahead and click continue.

Tyler: Okay. And then on this screen, you're not actually going to be able to click on everything. So just describe to me what you would be thinking and doing.

> P6: Gotcha. So again, it's pretty straightforward it ask me what state the school I want to go into is, and what state I actually live in.

> P6: Again the option. If I want to finish it later.

Tyler: Okay, cool. And so when it asks for your school state in this scenario. Does that feel kind of straightforward?

> P6: Yeah.

Tyler: And then do you feel like you have to give school state and residency state?

> P6: Well, actually, when I first looked at, I thought you had to have both. But I see up above it says, provide one of the following, so you could always put a big "or" in the middle of them. Because, sometimes I'll go right to the opposite of the what the instructions say.

Tyler: Awesome. So at first it seemed like you'd probably have to give both. So it took a second even notice that, yeah, that that makes a lot of sense. Okay, well, let's pretend like we put in, like, you know, Virginia, for one of them. And then we clicked continue.

Tyler: Now, tell me about this page.

> P6: Yeah, very specific, very self explanatory wants to know what subject I have, what the subject is and what the question is. Both of them are required to fill out, and I see it also gives me option to upload information by dragging it or choosing from the folder, either on my phone or computer.

Tyler: Cool. And so you know, when we started this process, and we were talking about, how like you can use this to ask the VA a question, does this feel like what you were expecting? Or does this feel different.

> P6: No, no, I think it's right along. It's right along the lines. I mean, it gives me the different options of what I want to ask them about. And then it actually lets me tell the subject, which I think is important, too, because, you know, it could be 10,000 questions about the 9/11 GI Bill. But here I've got the option to actually spell out here. Here's a brief thing of what it, what it is, and then I explain it.

Tyler: Yeah, cool. So this feels pretty straightforward for you to fill out and obviously in this scenario, you'd be writing something about the post 9 11 Gi. Bill, and then about whether you're eligible. And you also mentioned you can upload a document. Do you have to upload a document?

> P6: It says you can.

Tyler: Well, let's go ahead and continue on to the next page. We're just gonna pretend, like we filled that in.

Tyler: And then, on this page, what we're gonna do is pretend like that first name is actually your first name. So this is all filled in with your information.

Tyler: So, why is this filled in already?

> P6: If I'm not mistaken, it would be from the information, since I logged in or create account, all my information would be in that account. That's my assumption.

Tyler: Okay, so it has to do with the fact that you signed in.

> P6: Right.

Tyler: That makes sense.

Tyler: And is there anything else on this page that stands out to you?

> P6: It does require social security number days of date of birth, but the first few numbers are blacked out.

> P6: That's about it, and I also see preferred name so obviously like my name, full name's [name]. I go by [nickname], so.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So it's feeling pretty straightforward.

Tyler: And we'll say, that we checked all your information and it looked right and you can click, continue when you're ready.

> P6: Alright. Same thing, phone number and email address which I'm assuming they pulled from the same sign in information.

> P6: And I'm assuming these numbers and address I could change if I needed to.

Tyler: Yeah, do you feel like you could?

> P6: I think so. Because it says, required. So my assumption looking at is, like, if I needed to put a different phone number or a different email address then I could. That's my assumption by looking at the way it's set up.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. And you would just go in there and change it?

> P6: Right.

Tyler: Yeah, okay, let's say you did that. So you went and changed your phone number. You realize like you wanna put in a different phone number. Would you feel like your information was being updated just on this page or anywhere else with the VA?

> P6: So my assumption doing that would be... Well let me stop myself, because I see it says you can edit the form. So. But yeah, my assumption would be, it would be just on this page, not my profile. That's my assumption.

Tyler: Okay, cool. That makes sense.

Tyler: Alright. Well, I think that's all my questions on this page. So we'll go ahead and pretend like you updated your phone number on this page, and then we'll click continue. And tell me about what we're seeing now.

> P6: I guess this is just like I would say, a follow up with the initial one. Again it asks you why you're contacting us.

Tyler: Okay, what would you put in this scenario?

> P6: I had a question.

Tyler: Okay, let's click on I had a question. And then we can continue.

Tyler: You're breezing through this.

Tyler: What are we looking at now?

> P6: This looks like it's an opportunity to me to review everything that I put in. And if I need to edit it, and it says... Yeah, if you can edit, I can edit it.

Tyler Okay, cool. So you're reviewing information. And let's say that this was all your information in here.

> P6: Good. Edit buttons for both.

Tyler: Cool. Okay, that that feels pretty straightforward it. It feels like it makes sense that this pages here, then we can go ahead and submit your question.

Tyler: And then I'll give you a second to read this.

Tyler: I'd love for you to tell me what it's telling you.

> P6: Alright. So basically, it says that it confirms that I submitted the question successfully, gives me a reference number that I could either write down or take a screenshot.

> P6: It also says I'm going to get a email confirmation and that I should receive apply within some business days. And if they need more information they will contact me. And then on the bottom, it's obviously got the information. I need help numbers and also for hearing loss.

Tyler: Cool. Okay, do you think at this point, you'd have any questions like is any information missing for you?

> P6: No, no, the only thing. If it hadn't said that I would get email confirmation. That's the only thing that I would be looking for specifically so. But it's got that.

Tyler: Yeah. Okay, perfect. Well, you've reached the end of the prototype. So we can. Actually, you can stop sharing your screen if we want to come back and just have a chat for a couple of minutes. So since I'm not seeing your screen, I'm not exactly. Oh, that you got it cool. So there you are, perfect.

### Cool down

Tyler: So what did you think of that process? Is there anything that you liked about it?

> P6: That it was straightforward. Everything was spelled out. I mean, that's the one thing that I do notice that the VA does pretty well. Kind of makes it 7 year old easy. You know, which I think everybody needs.

Tyler: For sure. Yeah. So it felt pretty straightforward, and maybe kind of like simple enough to get through it. Did you feel like there was anything that could have been easier?

> P6: No. The only thing that I thought was odd I don't know if you're gonna get to it but that was the one section was, what was I trying to do today. In that spot? Because in the start I said I was asking a question. It took me all through and then asked me what am I doing? And it's like, well, I'm asking a question. So that was an odd placement. But that's just me.

Tyler: Yeah, well, it's not just you. Because, I do think other people are feeling that, too, so it felt kind of redundant, and also like probably a weird time, to ask that question. That that totally makes sense.

Tyler: I'd love to like, learn about how you felt, about how long the process was – Let me just pause for a second. Is the street cleaning really loud for you right now? On my street?

> P6:  No.

Tyler: Oh good. So I'd love to just talk a little bit about how long the process felt while you were filling out the form. Did you feel like you knew how much longer you had left?

> P6: Not, really because I've noticed that, like any place that has a form like this that you fill out, you never really know when you're getting to the end. I do know it did have a progress bar. But sometimes those really don't mean anything because you could do something, and it moves a minuscule amount. So.

> P6: I didn't think I knew where I was other than having done it before and knowing kind of what the flow of it is. But I didn't think it was arduous, either. I didn't think it was like, you know, wasting my time to do whatever. There's nothing that I clicked there that I didn't think I needed to be there.

Tyler: That makes sense. So it didn't feel like it was like annoyingly long. But also you did mention the progress bar... Is it kind of a little bit meaningless because you're like, I'm not sure if it's gonna go one on this page or 20.

> P6: Right. Right.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. Do you feel like it's important to you to know that you are progressing through the form? Or do you think that that's like kind of unnecessary.

> P6: No, I think it's good for me. I'm gonna do what I have to do regardless. But I think other people they like that, so I wouldn't take it away. Let's put it that way, because I think it does hold value, just not for everybody.

Tyler: Yeah. Do you think there's a way that it could be more helpful for someone, like, you?

> P6: I didn't notice if it said Page X of X. That might be... But again, I wasn't looking for that because that's not something that I track. Like for me, if I'm on a mission, I gotta find something out about something, I'm gonna do it regardless. But if it didn't have that, that might be helpful, like, you know. Page 5 of 13.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. So you're kind of like I have to do it anyways. So I might as well just keep going rather than worrying too much. Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: This is even more hypothetical. But what if it said like this is page 2 of 5. And then you went to the next page, and it said, this is page 3 of 7.

> P6: That would be annoying. That would be annoying.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P6: Yeah. But and then and again, I guess, depending on the certain scenario of why I'm contacting them. Those that could change and that might not be programmable. And as such.

Tyler: Yeah. That makes sense. And we talked a little bit during the session about like, if you had to, for whatever reason, put down your question and come back to it later, you would be able to save your progress, and you'd be able to refine your question and kind of keep going. Can you picture something like that happening for you?

> P6: Yeah, I've done that. I know one of the times that I had to submit a claim. I had to do that. So, and it was very helpful to be able to go back and go back in. And I have to start all the way from the beginning, but also having the ability to go back if I needed to change something.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense, especially for like submitting a claim where it might be a little bit more involved of a process.

Tyler: Earlier, we talked about how you use my healthyevet, secure messaging to talk to your healthcare team?

> P6: Yeah.

Tyler: I'm curious like, how you feel like these experiences compare to one another. Do you feel like there's anything that's similar about them? Do you feel like they're very different?

> P6: No, it's pretty similar, because you have to sign in, you know. And then you have to find the place on on the website, you know, even if you go, my healthyevet, you still have to find secure messaging, or you have to find prescription refill. So I do say that's the one thing that the VA seems to do pretty good at their websites is they're very straightforward, for where things are they're not like hidden.

> P6: And I also noticed, if you've had to go to pages and you go to the wrong page, there'll be options. Were you looking for this? And that's again also very helpful and less frustrating.

Tyler: Okay, so like, you feel like, it's pretty easy to find the place that you're trying to go. Which makes sense.

> P6: Yes.

Tyler: When you talk to your like doctor, for example, you don't have to like, tell them who you are every time. You just sign in, and then, you know, it's assumed that they have your information, whereas in this case you did have to review your first name and your last name and your date of birth, Does that make sense that that's different in those different contexts?

> P6: Oh, yeah, yeah, I can. I can see that it is [different] because again, when I'm signed in for the secure messaging they have everything about me, and they know it's coming from me. This is I'm signing in. But I wanna find out something. So again. I've signed in and everything. But it's also a good review, because addresses change, phone numbers change, things like that, whereas that's not as important with my provider other than a prescription, because it'll get mailed to me, or I gotta go pick it up so.

Tyler: Right that makes sense. So it's you can see, kind of like how it's different a little bit different. And for both of these we're talking about like needing to sign in. Do you ever do anything on VA websites where you don't need to sign in?

> P6: If I'm just getting general information, yeah, there are times that I don't sign in. But again, it's really just an information thing more than trying to do something.

Tyler: Yeah, awesome.

Tyler: I think you've answered all my questions. We went really quickly and I think it's been really, really helpful to hear from you. I could see that there was... it was easy for you to click through the form like there wasn't big hurdles that would have stopped you. But I did, I did notice, at the beginning. there was a little bit more like reading involved. So, it's been really useful. And we really appreciate you taking the time to do this for us.

> P6: Yeah. And then, like, I said, the only thing that that stood out to me that is, there wasn't a 988 there. That's pretty much the only thing.

Tyler: Yeah, that's helpful. Yeah. And we've noted that down. So, yeah, I appreciate it. Well, in terms of next steps. The folks who set up this research session. They're gonna get in touch with you. They'll send you a thank you note. They'll give you information that you can pass on to other Veterans in case they want to do something like this. And if you have any questions you can just reach out to them. But I think that's all for me. I hope you have a lovely rest of the day.

> P6: Yes, you as well. Thank you.

Tyler: Awesome. See ya.

> P6: Alright, bye.

Tyler: Bye.
