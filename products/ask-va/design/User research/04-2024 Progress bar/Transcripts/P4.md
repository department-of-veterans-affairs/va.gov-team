### Warm up

Tyler: Okay. So the recording has started, I just wanna confirm that you're comfortable. If I record my screen and audio today.

Tyler: Awesome. At this point. Do you have any questions for me?

> P4: Not so far.

Tyler: Okay, cool. Well, before we get into looking at the prototype and getting some of your feedback, I'd love to just learn a little bit more about your experience with the VA. How long have you been a Veteran?

> P4: So I got out in 2002.

Tyler: Okay, did you start interacting with the VA right when you got out of service? Or after a while?

> P4: I did. And so recently, like the last 2 years I kind of been reapplying for disability and stuff like that. So I've been reaching out, and they've been sending me to like tons of specialists. So I've worked with like messaging different doctors, and we had issues with like my prescriptions and then sending them. They just kept sending prescriptions so like they would send 3 months at a time, but they incorrectly were charging me, and so I've had the whole, the whole thing of dealing with the incorrect billing and reaching into the phone and then trying to reach out to the doctors and saying you didn't put over service connected.

> P4: So it was a big issue like it went, like they tried to put on my credit report. And then we finally found someone like called. I have like 16 pages of notes of people I spoke to, and as I've been rerouted so many times and hung up on like the system. I don't know. It's just crazy. The experience that I have is, it looks like it's declined. Compared to when I first came in. Which should be improving, but so.

Tyler: Right.

> P4: My experience hasn't been the greatest, but I have seen them. When I reached out to like the developers, they did make changes like I did see that they did fix it. But then sometimes it breaks. But you know, I understand that's technology, too. So.

Tyler: Yeah, well, that makes sense. But I'm also sorry to hear you're having a tough time and being rerouted and sent to a lot of different places. I'm sure that that's unfortunately not an uncommon experience. But we can talk a little bit more about that today. And that's all mostly related to healthcare that you're talking about, right?

> P4: Right

Tyler: And then getting in touch with the VA, like, when you wanted to for example re, address your disability rating like around 2 years ago. How did you get in touch? In the first place, where did you begin that process.

> P4: I went through like all of my medical records and started pulling out. So I have like an auto condition that was never diagnosed. I was pretty much misdiagnosed my whole life, and so I got really sick and found an integrated doctor. That's when. But I actually reached out to company because I was like I couldn't do the whole process. So I was trying to do it, and I had stats of paperwork and stuff like that, and then I was just too sick.

> P4:  My husband. You know, he's trying to help and still do his job and take care of me. And so we just decided to, you know, not let someone help us with that stuff because it's like it was just too much to be able to do.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. And I'm really sorry that it isn't easier.

Tyler: So you talk to your providers and  I think you mentioned messaging them and things like that. Do you ever just call like the general VA phone line? Or have you ever tried the chat or anything else like that?

> P4: Yeah. I've done. I've been on the phone for like ever. Really the messaging system kind of only gets you to like send a message to your doctor, and so.

> P4: Sometimes, like my doctors like I'll have specialty doctors that I'll have appointments with, and I'll try to reach out to them because they live about hour and a half away from any of the you know VA centers and the doctors will also disappear from my list. So like, if I have messaged them before. I can't get them back. So if I follow up  what that message on there so like, we're not having the providers, but the messaging system, once you get logged in, has been pretty good.

> P4: Sometimes getting logged in is really the challenge, like it's just. There's been times dealing with the travel agency and stuff like that like you cannot get a hold of them.

Tyler: Yeah part. That makes sense and you mentioned earlier, the login is a hurdle too.

Tyler: Have you ever heard of Ask VA? Or sometimes it's called AVA?

> P4: Is that the app?

Tyler: It's not the app. It's different to the mobile app. And it's okay if you haven't heard of it.

> P4: Don't think so...

Tyler: Okay. Awesome. Well, what we're gonna do now we're gonna shift gears. And I'm gonna share something with you. That we can walk through together, and I'll get your feedback. Okay. So I'm gonna send you a link in the zoom chat.

Tyler: And when you see the link show up in the chat, if you can just open that for me on your screen, and then let me know once that's loaded for you.

> P4: Okay. Yup. Oh, yeah, I've been on this. I just didn't know it was Ask VA. But this is where I go usually to.

> P4: We're almost like it's the same login, like the same sign in screen.

Tyler: Yeah, okay, so it's looking familiar. So what I'm gonna have you do is I'm gonna ask you to share your screen with me. Have you shared your screen on zoom before?

> P4: Yeah, let me get some things for arranged, because I got.

Tyler: Yes, take your time.

> P4: And I can't see. Am I still on video?

Tyler: You're still on video. Yeah. But I'm not seeing your screen.

> P4: Yeah, I lost my video.

> P4: Sorry about this really quick. We don't use...

Tyler: Oh, don't worry.

> P4: Now I can see. Let me see if I can share screen it must have reduced. Let me share this one. So you should just be able to see that one?

### Homepage to sign in

Tyler: Yep, that's perfect. Okay. So we're all set here up here so I can see the same thing that you're seeing and I'm just gonna give you a moment. We're not gonna click on anything yet, but you're welcome to scroll around, and I'd love for you to tell me what you're noticing first.

> P4: The sign in on the top right, and then the create your sign in.

Tyler: Awesome. And what is this page specifically about?

> P4: This would be like. I would guess that you get signed in to see, like all of the main VA things like the main VA that you can click. Maybe possibly like where you can click and go into like the travel, or where you can sign into the healthcare. You can kind of see, like the other things that VA provides.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, so it's kind of like, maybe a starting point for a lot of different VA services.

> P4: Right.

Tyler: I'm gonna give you a second to read the page a little more closely now. And tell me what's jumping out at you.

> P4: That you only use it for non VA needs. That they can ask personal questions. Yeah, education work study debts. Communicate about your benefits. If you need communication urgently, you would go to veterans crisis line.

> P4: You can use secure messaging there, which I like that they put that there, because sometimes that may be kind of hard for people to find and then if you need to contact them. Other things.

Tyler: Awesome. It's really helpful when you speak out loud like that.

> P4: Oh, okay.

Tyler: What is that, what is check the status of your question? What is that talking about?

> P4: I would think that you would type or like your the reference number. Maybe if you file for something, have like a reference. I don't know. I'm never. I don't think I have reference numbers at this time. I don't know where the reference number would be like.

> P4: You know what I mean, like I don't know where.

> P4: If that's on like, where you print your VA information, I don't know. I don't know what the reference number would be.

Tyler: That's okay, that makes sense.

> P4: What is the reference number?

Tyler: Well, I'm going to wait to answer that. If it's okay. But that's helpful to understand that that's not clear. I can see why that's not clear.

> P4: So that box to me would be like if I had a question I would type in like you know how to get to travel or go search, you know, like that would be like what I would think it would be. But I don't think that's what it is.

Tyler: That makes sense.

Tyler: So if we sit here at the top for a second... for the rest of our conversation today, we're we're gonna do is we're gonna pretend, like, you need to ask the VA a question. Okay? So let's say that you'd like to learn whether you're eligible for Post 9/11 GI Bill benefits.

Tyler: Okay. Are you familiar with the GI bill?

> P4: I am. Yep.

Tyler: Okay.

> P4: Haven't used it for like a long time. But yeah.

Tyler: Okay. No worries. So for the benefit of everyone on this call, the post 9/11 GI Bill helps you pay for school or job training. And so people who served on active duty after September 10th 2001 might qualify for these education benefits.

Tyler: So, [P4], I'll remind you of this scenario as we go along as needed.

Tyler: But without clicking anything. Yet can you tell me what you would do first to ask the VA if you're eligible for Post 911 GI Bill benefits?

> P4: I would probably go to be benefits and healthcare, and to see. Because I would think that would lead me to everything like burial, and you know what I mean, like everything that we would have, or I would go to the search.

Tyler: Right. Okay, that makes sense.

> P4: Usually I try to sign in first and see if it lets me sign in, because, like one of my challenges have been where I'll find where I need to go and then sign in, and then it brings me back to the main page and then I have to start all over again. So usually I try to sign in.

> P4: Sometimes even when you sign in it will still take you out when you get to the page you're on, and then it'll have you sign in again. But because it's a different site. Sometimes you have to go incognito, because it'll keep like that cache in the system, and then not like you log into like, I know. That's my login. I just log in. So that's one of the things that I've kind of noticed is that I try to log in first. Usually that makes a little bit easier. But there's some days where you're not going to get logged in at all.

Tyler: Totally okay, that's really helpful. So you prefer to just sign in right away.

> P4: And with travel when you can't get signed in, you only have 30 days, and like for me when I'm so sick I would have like appointments and everything. And I would have like a day where I'm like, okay, I feel good. I can get logged in. I'm not, you know. I can kinda navigate the system, and then it wouldn't work. I would trying it all day and then try it the next day, and then, you know, then I would be sick. And then, like, you know, it's you're kinda getting past the 30 days, because every time try to log in it doesn't let you all get.

> P4: So it's like, either they need to like expand the 30 days if they're gonna have issues like that. Cause it was, it wasn't so bad because, Covid, they extended it out, and now they move down to 30 days. And it's like, if you're not diligently about going in and having to keep trying to log in and just kind of have, you know, that's kind of difficult, because I don't think a lot of people are going to be like I have to file it by this day.

Tyler: Yeah, that's a really good consideration. That makes sense.

Tyler: So I'm gonna just give us a little bit more context now that we've asked some questions about this page. So we're gonna say that you were searching around Va.gov, so you were on this website and you were trying to figure out if you were eligible for these education benefits right?

Tyler: And you landed on this page, and it says, Ask VA get answers to your questions about VA benefits and services. Okay, it sounds like you're someone who would very likely want to sign in because you think that the Va. Probably wants you to sign in, and you don't wanna have to go halfway through your thing and then sign in right.

> P4: Right.

Tyler: Yeah, yeah.

> P4: When you're just doing kind of like the main page like my benefits are, gonna be something different than somebody else's cause. You know, I've already used my education benefits, or something like that.

> P4: Then what you know, we each have our own benefits and level like that. So I think that's why it would be better to sign in because I don't wanna know what someone else may get. I wanna know what I'm gonna get. You know, I'm not have to be like. Oh, well, can I get that.

Tyler: Yeah. That makes sense like it, especially with the VA and with disability rating. You want specific advice for yourself. That makes a lot of sense. So why don't we pretend like we're on this page. Now, you've decided you're gonna sign in. So you can get that more specific experience.

Tyler: I see that your mouse is moving towards that sign in button at the top of the page right?

Tyler: That makes sense.

> P4: Supposed to be here... [Tries to click.]

Tyler: Well for today, this prototype won't actually let you click on the sign in. But normally, that would make a ton of sense. But let's scroll down a little bit, and we'll just click the other sign in button that you mentioned. Yeah, we'll click on that, and then we'll stop here for a second.

Tyler: So we're not actually gonna sign in for this research session. But we'll pretend like we signed in. So we'll pretend like you use login.gov, and you put in your username and password. You did the whole thing.

Tyler: And it worked and we'll go ahead and click on the red button at the top. The Login.gov button.

> P4: Oh, right here.

Tyler: Yeah, we'll click on that. So we'll just pretend like we've done the whole sign in. I know we didn't do it, but I'll save some time at the end, so we can talk a little bit more about sign in, because I know we kind of breezed past that, and you have some thoughts there.

### Through to submission

Tyler: But let's say we're here now we've signed in. Can you tell me what page we're on. Can you describe this to me?

> P4: Yeah, if you're gonna have, if you're gonna ask a question for non emergency use.

Tyler: Okay and if you have a question, you've decided, you're gonna ask the VA, can you show me how you would start that?

Tyler: Okay. Awesome. And now we're here. So you go ahead and and keep clicking and tell me what you're thinking as you do that.

> P4: And are we doing the education benefits still?

Tyler: We are, yeah.

> P4: Okay. So you would do that education and benefit work study.

Tyler: Okay. Awesome.

> P4: Do you just want me to keep clicking.

Tyler: Yeah, and I'll stop you as needed. But for now just keep doing what you'd do if I wasn't here.

Tyler: So for this one, it looks like you're opening up the select menu again, and then tell me what you're looking for here.

> P4: It would be, are we doing the post 911 GI Bill?

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense.

> P4: And then continue, and then I would say, I'm the Veteran.

Tyler: And for this one [GI Bill beneficiary] what would you be putting? What would you think here? It looks like you're trying to click yes, right?

> P4: Well, yeah, like, if I thought I was gonna be looking into GI benefits, I would click on that one. And if I'm qualified.

Tyler: Right.

> P4: I guess, but not sure. I wasn't sure.

Tyler: If you hadn't yet figured out, if you were eligible for GI Bill benefits, but you thought you were eligible, would you click yes?

> P4: I would click yes.

Tyler: Okay, cool. That's really helpful.

> P4: So I would figure if they could tell me yes, then they would be like no, you don't, you know. I'm sure some people would click on that. Sure, you know.

> P4: I think, usually dealing with technology. Yes, will probably be the more direct. If I tell you no. Instead of going here, then they'll probably ask you more questions. Then maybe like I would think that if I'm signed in and I click yes, so say, Oh, yeah, you are eligible for GI benefits, and maybe we miss not having to answer extra questions.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense. Well, for today, let's just click on no.

Tyler: But that but that's really helpful to better understand how you'd answer this.

Tyler: For this page, we're not gonna be able to click on this. So just let me know. What would you do on this page? Can you describe to me?

> P4: I would I would click on the dropdown, find. Then I would find that residency state like, I would think it's the like the school state, like I'm in [State], and I wanted to go to the [State] school. I would pick [State]. This was not like they're residing...

> P4: It would be the state that I'm currently living in. But it may be like, you may put like current residency, because I know a lot of people like Veterans, like they think the residency is kind of like where you were born and raised where you came from in the military. So I would say, like current resident state, that makes it maybe a little bit more clear.

> P4: And then school state desired.

> P4: The residency state would be maybe a little unclear, but I mean I would think that it would be [State], you know, like where I am on there. But the Residency I did kind of think would I be [other State]? Is that mine? Kind of go through the hometown out there, for, like the military...

Tyler: Yeah, that's really helpful feedback. And then, before we click, continue, would you put in both your school state and your residency state?

> P4: Yeah. Even though, some people may think just the school state cause that's required. Because I don't see an asterisk. But I would do both. But some people may just say I'm just gonna do what's required, and not answer the rest.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, well, we'll pretend like you put in [State], probably for both of those. And we'll click continue.

Tyler: And now we aren't gonna be able to type in the prototype. But walk me through what you would be thinking when you saw this page.

> P4: I would normally be like, this is kind of like we're gonna send like a secure message. It looks like you're gonna provide like a message or like an email format. So I would put like, Post 911 GI Bill benefits eligibility. And the subject, and I would put like... I don't know I would normally when I give them. I got up the State, and I haven't used my education benefits, or I have, and I just want to know, you know. Am I still eligible? Or do I have anything left on my education benefits?

> P4: And then I may submit something like my DD214 here. Or if I have something paperwork that I think that may be helpful. I would attach it, and then I would do continue.

Tyler: Awesome. You're very good at being a research participant, cause you've answered all my questions as you've described what you would do.

> P4: That's all I did for 10 years for Apple. Recording questions and everything has to be very direct, because you get people who are very mad and listen. If you listen like I would literally we would be screen sharing. I would have it here. I'm like, click here, click here. And they wouldn't even. And I'm like, it's gonna be a really long day. So I learned to be very efficient. So I was like. That's why they would be okay. I think it's gonna be good for everybody.

Tyler: Yeah, awesome. Okay. Well, that was really helpful. Let's go ahead and continue like you said.

Tyler: Okay, so now we're on this page. So we're gonna pretend like instead of it saying, Hector it, said, [P4], so this is all your information. Yep.

> P4: And then the name and middle name so mandatory...

> P4: Social security number. I wonder what my service number was? I think they may have service numbers now instead of social security. But I'm not sure. I think my ID card may have a service number. But we really didn't have service numbers when I was in.

> P4: And then just date of birth, and then continue.

Tyler: Okay. And why do you feel like this has all been pre-filled?

> P4: Well, maybe if you logged in already before, it would be nice if it was phone if you logged in.

> P4: That's like, normally, why, I would like login, because hopefully, it would do things like this for them and be like, oh, it's already done, and you could just click, you know, next, I like that. It does auto fill, and you can change it like if you can click and change it. If something's wrong that would be good, too, on there. 

Tyler: Awesome that that makes a lot of sense. So we'll click continue, we'll go to the next screen. And similarly, like, let's pretend like it had your email address and your phone number. And you mentioned just now, like, if something was wrong, hopefully, I'd be able to just click in and change it. So let's say you got a new email address. So you'd be expecting to be able to like click, where your mouse is right now, and you'd be able to type in there?

> P4: Yep.

Tyler: That makes sense. And then if you did that, so let's say you changed your email address here, would you expect your email address to be updated anywhere else, or would it just be on this page?

> P4: I would think just this page, because, like, I know I have separate emails, like, if I'm going to use one for military, or if I use one for personal, but, like. I noticed I was using everything it was like a [type of] email.

> P4: But when I was sick I wanted everything at the Gmail one because, my husband, it was easier just able to check that one. We didn't have to check multiple email. So I would think it would just be for this one and not for all communication. 

> P4: That's how I would prefer to have it done.

Tyler: Okay, cool. That makes a lot of sense.

Tyler: We can go ahead and click continue.

Tyler: Okay. And now we're on this screen. So we'll just pause here for a second. How much longer do you feel like this process is gonna be?

> P4: I would think maybe like 5 min, I mean, not even I would hope that would be like 2 min of that. That's like the longest process, I would think to me we should be pretty close to an answer. I would think.

> P4: My dog was snoring. Oh, no.

Tyler: No worries.

> P4: No, she's gonna hear her.

Tyler: I can't hear her, but that's no problem.

> P4: I'm sorry.

Tyler: No worries! Okay, cool. So why don't you show me what you do on this page?

> P4: I would say I have the question and then continue.

Tyler: Okay, let's continue.

Tyler: And then on this page you're not gonna be able to click anything. But tell me what this, what's the purpose of this page?

> P4: I would think I would be able to expand and see like my question. And then maybe if I decided like, I submitted something and I'm like, oh, I forgot to say, when I got out that I could add something to the question and make sure I try to give as much information as the person on the other side's gonna need to give me my answer.

> P4: So sometimes I'll be like, Oh, maybe I should, said, you know, when I got out, or you know that I use partial benefits. I think I still have some, but I'm not sure.

> P4: And then I'm just checking my personal information and then click edit if I needed to change something, and then that lets me change it, and then I would just hit submit.

Tyler: Right. Okay, awesome. That makes sense. So you would probably err on the side of like over sharing almost so that they would have all the information they need

Tyler: That makes sense.

> P4: Because it's so hard to get to somebody to begin with. And then when someone doesn't give you all that information, then it takes extra time for that person to go back and need to go back. It's just easier to get everybody – the information I know a lot of people don't. But like, if you do give them all the information, it should be nice and easy for everybody. They should be able to go in and say, okay, we got everything you need and get the answer without having to go back and forth. So.

Tyler: Totally. Yeah, I get that. And then you've quickly found the submit button. I can see your mouse. So let's go ahead and click submit.

Tyler: And I'll give you a minute to read this, and then tell me what this page is telling you?

> P4: Well you have the reference number on there. So that's I would save the reference number. Probably a lot of people won't. Hopefully that they would send an email and saying, hey, thanks for reaching out to the VA. Here's your reference number in case you need to have follow up communication, and that way you had a reference number, nice and easy, like.

> P4: I'm never gonna remember memorize that. So it says you will receive an email so that's that. You can receive reply by emails in 7 days.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P4: If we need more information, then we'll contact you, and it'll be another 7 days, you know, possibly for them to go back and give them more information on there and then, like you could call if you're having an issue.

> P4: Then I've submitted feedback before, like you, just like when I logged in. Kind of tell the developers, hey? You know, it won't let me change my email address. I wouldn't use a different one, or my phone numbers wrong. It won't let me change. And so like, that's when I would usually reach out and say, Hey, can we? It isn't working right or something like that on there.

Tyler: Awesome that that all makes a lot of sense. I'm curious... when we started the form, when you first started to put your category, and you said education benefits and so on. What did you think was gonna happen at the end? Does this match your expectation, that you're gonna get a reply in 7 business days?

> P4: I would be pretty bummed. I would think that like, initially, I thought it would let you log in, and then, you see, like your post 911 page. You've exhausted everything, or you haven't used it. Here's how you can apply. Here's how you get to your first steps. It would direct me somewhere else than just giving me a reference number. And I'm like, I have to wait 7 days to find out if it's a yes or no? Because if it's a yes, I'm gonna start researching, ya know, schools. But I'd be kind of bummed that I had to waste 7 days. Like you asked me all of that, and then I don't have an answer after all of that.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

Tyler: I think we've reached the end of the prototype. So you can actually stop sharing your screen if you prefer, and then we can come back and just chat.

### Cool down

Tyler: Perfect. So that was really helpful. What did you think of the process? Was there anything that you liked about it?

> P4: I like that. It does auto fill the things in.

> P4: [I like that] it is a pretty basic layout, cause, I know, like a lot of elderly and, even if you're not elderly, if you're not very good, like my husband would be like, I don't know where to go for something. He's more mechanical than technological and stuff. So I think it's pretty easy like to go in and to navigate.

> P4: It's just whether or not – if the system's going to work or not, it has been my main challenges. And I'm not getting to submit my travel. One is kind of confusing, too, on how to get to like the travel, but once you figure it out, I kinda know.

> P4: I like that it's pretty basic. It's not too much. I mean, I would think it would be too confusing for people. I mean, we always say, reading is fundamental, like, if you can read the screen, if it's a good laid out screen, you should be able to get it if it's basic.

> P4: But a lot of people read. They're just like, I don't know where to go. It's like, are you reading things.

> P4: Laid out pretty easy and it's not busy, and things like that on there. It's pretty basic.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. It was it felt like it was pretty quick for you to go through it. And I imagine if we weren't talking you would have done it even faster. So I think that that's probably a good sign. And you mentioned the Pre. Filled information was good, and you sound like you would have signed in. You tend to sign in, so that would have worked out well for you.

Tyler: I'm curious. I wanna talk a little bit about like kind of the length of the form. And as you were filling it out, did you feel like you knew how much longer you had left?

> P4: Maybe I mean, I would think maybe the longest that the process should take is like 5 min, you know. That would be a long time to go through.

> P4: But it may take people who are like reading things slower like I had a lot of brain fog and stuff, and I still do, so I take time to read things more, and it's not like overloaded to words like you have to read a whole page to get that's where you go.

> P4: It's pretty basic. It's pretty simple. Click here, you know. So I didn't find anything like really confusing or daunting about getting into that system the only thing at the end. It just didn't give me the any information like I feel like you should, after you log in, you should be able to get some information.

> P4: And at the end. In 7 days someone will contact me. Okay.

Tyler: Right. Yeah, it was a little bit of a letdown, but it felt like while you were doing it. It was straightforward enough, and you didn't feel like you were unsure, like, where you were, in the form or like why, a certain question was coming up.

> P4: No.

Tyler: I'm curious.

> P4: The only thing was like the current residency like, if they put 'current' because a lot of people think you're residency state is like your hometown, for, like registration for the military.

> P4: That's the only thing I found kind of confusing. Sometimes they still want like [your hometown state] from your DD214 to make sure it matches. That's the only thing it's kind of like confusing. Which one you wanted on there.

Tyler: For sure. No, that was a really good call out.

Tyler: So in this form compared to maybe other forms there wasn't any way of you figuring out how far along you were like. It never said you're on step one of 10, and never kind of gave you any sort of idea of your progress. And it wasn't. That wasn't an issue that you pointed out to me. So I'm curious, like your thoughts there. Do you think that something like that is helpful for you? Did you feel like you noticed anything wasn't there?

> P4: It's helpful when you do that because it's like if just have a little bit of time, like, if you're on your break at work, you're like, let me see, when you get logged in real quick, it's something. And then I'm like, do I have 20 more things they have to do? Or am I gonna have to stop because I don't want to be late? Or you know what I mean, like your kid needs help or something, you know. Do I have to start all over? So I think that would be really helpful to find you have 5 more steps, you have 2 more questions, or something like I think that would be helpful.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. And you just brought up another question for me, which is like let's say, like, you were going to help your kid for a moment. And you were kind of halfway through the process. Would you be able to save your question and come back to it later, or what would happen in that scenario?

> P4: I would hope so. I would hope that it would have like, you know, maybe like where your progress is say, step 5 out of 10, and then it can be like, you know, if you need to save your progress, push save right there.

> P4: And then you wouldn't be like, okay, I'll have to start all over again. And I can't stop or like, you know, if I maybe I can hurry up, and if I have to get back to work, maybe I can hurry up and do 3 more pages if I can't see it, you know. So I think that would be helpful. I think a lot of people that are busy and things happen, or they get a phone call. And then if it times out you're back.

Tyler: Yeah, for sure. I can see that, and if you like, if it saved your question, and it was something you could come back to and finish later. Like, where would you find that question that you left off on to start again? Do you have any idea where that'd be?

> P4: Like when I go to the main page. I would hope that when I go to the main login page that I would log in, and then it would like say, Oh, are you asking about your post 911 benefits? Continue here.

> P4: That would be helpful. Be like, oh, it's right there we can start from, you know, not start from scratch. That would be nice and easy instead of going, like a lot of people are honestly are not gonna remember how they did that. 10 clicks before. Take it to the page that they were on.

Tyler: I think you've answered all of my questions, that was really helpful, I think we sort of sped through it. Which is always, which is always great. Do you have any questions for me? We can talk a little bit about the thing we just we just looked through. If that's interesting to you. We can talk about sign in if that's helpful.

> P4: I think the sign in is like, out of all of the things I've ever had. The issue is like when it reroutes you, or when you click and you get to the page, and then it sends you to the sign in page, and then you lose where you're at like it does. That will travel all the time with the travel page, or like, if you are signed in to the VA medical and you try to go send a message. It'll resend you to the Login, and then it does not let you log in.

> P4: Maybe something helpful would be like if you can't log in and you're using this browser click on here if you can't log in click here and click here, then that page when they click safari or chrome, or you know. Whatever browser they're gonna use. Then it would get give them instructions go to click on that upper right, click here to clear cache. Or here's how, if you want to go to incognito tab, that's usually the easiest way for most people as just to do it. But it's not gonna save like your login information on an incognito page.

> P4: That's like the only thing frustrating is really getting in. And then, like being on the login, you finally get to that page, and then the person you need to message isn't there? And it's like I've just done all that for nothing. And you know it's like – that's what I find like frustrating is the login like, oh, I have.

> P4: I can log in every single way. And usually I have to try 2 or 3 times for each login to see which one's gonna work again. If I go on roxy.com, I use the login id the government login and id the exact same one I can. It gives me my code, and there it is, like, I don't have problem on any other sites. So I don't know. I'm sure it's probably for security, and then they probably. But if they could not keep it off the cache that would work a lot better, at least let people know cause.

> P4: I mean a lot of times people will, you know, like my husband would click on it. And then, like, Okay, I probably can click here here and here here, and be able to do very simple steps. And then maybe have like support. Like, if you haven't found your answer, click here, you can call here, or something like that would be helpful.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. So it was like just to make sure, I'm following is a lot of that login struggle or like issue with getting sent back to where you were, is that a lot of the issue?

> P4: It's that plus it doesn't log you in. Like you go and you log in, and it just doesn't work. And there, you know, you just keep trying throughout the day. And it does it even through like the VA app. Like it's great when Face ID works. But then the Face ID doesn't work all the time. And then you're like, Okay.

> P4: I can't even see them. I see I got a message. I can't get logged in. The login is really a big issue, like log in the Login, Gov is usually the top 2 choices that we have, because the healthy benefits that used to work. And now they're like that. One doesn't work to get to every place. So I'm like, why? Well, why am I going to use that one?

> P4: I don't know. It's weird. But I'm glad they do have multiple options, because I have used every single one to see if one will just give me a hit to log in.

Tyler: Yeah, no. That makes sense.

> P4: I think a lot of like working with customers a lot of times like I know. I know my login. On my computer. I have a database like I know, that's my login. And a lot of times people be like. I don't know. I that may not be my login, and they'll re keep changing their passwords. And they're like, I don't know why I can't get logged in, and they're probably gonna get locked out, you know. Extra frustration there. 

Tyler: Totally. Yeah. So are you hitting like an error page in those scenarios where it's just like not signing you in or is it getting stuck at one point?

> P4: They don't give you like a login error. And then if you do get logged in, then it doesn't let you get to where you were before.

> P4: And when you do get to where you were before, then you have to re-log in. So you're like you've already logged in. And now you get to have the page, and they're like, well, you need to log in again, and it's just a vicious cycle.

> P4: Where it just doesn't let you log in, and you're like I don't understand. But then sometimes they'll let you log in. And then when you go to where you are, then I'll say, oh, your login is invalid. And it's like, I know it's valid. I just won't be, you know, so I don't know why. I don't know what has what their challenges are, and why? That is...

> P4: Definitely, I think, like the biggest challenge that I have. But like, I love the messaging system because it's the easiest way to get to your doctor and get you know what I mean to place this and like the Travel Agency, I think you can only do it by phone with them, which is pretty difficult sometimes to get someone to answer the phone.

> P4: Even the Pharmacy department, just like hours sometime of me just sitting on the phone stick trying to like contact someone to get an inhaler. You know, like that's I had to go find some going healthcare. It was like, I can't really breathe. You know. That was something I realized I never had like that delay in the behavior. I did finally experience them like, you know, I thought usually because we're in [city] and stuff like that, like we have pretty good health here, but we see that how we're having issues with, you know, being able to get care and be seen.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P4: Like I can't breathe. It's like, you know, it's like, I'm just gonna go do what I need to do. But you know, luckily I had the means, and I had my own insurance, but I'm like I shouldn't have to go through my own insurance, or a lot of people don't have that option.

Tyler: Totally. Yeah.

Tyler: Yeah, that's quite scary, especially when you need something urgently.

> P4: Yeah.

Tyler: Well, like, I said at the beginning I'll be upfront and say, I don't personally have a good way of fixing a lot of these problems. But I do think for peace of mind like, I know, people are very aware of the issues with the sign in. And there's more people than one might guess who are trying to fix it. So I think maybe we're all a little bit hopeful that it's gonna get better, but I know that in the meantime it's it's roughest and toughest for Veterans who are just trying to get access to to their healthcare, or whatever it may be. So we appreciate you like giving feedback, and I think continuing to do these sessions will also be helpful.

Tyler: Hopefully, we're moving in the right direction. But in the meantime I'm I hope you're managing to get through it. And, yeah, I hear you.

Tyler: Do you have any other questions for me?

> P4: Not too many other questions. So all good.

Tyler: Awesome.

Tyler: Well, thank you so much for your time. This has been really, really helpful. We are excited to read back through the feedback you've given us, and we could not do this work without talking to Veterans like yourself, so I hope you continue to sign up for sessions like this.

Tyler: And you'll get a thank you note from Perigean. They're the folks who set up the session. And if you have any questions you can. You can let them know. But I think that's it. I hope you have a lovely rest of your day.

> P4: Thank you. And thanks for like, you know, this, you know, does is gonna help a lot of Veterans and stuff being able to be able to get in and stuff like that. So it's nice to know that they're at least trying to attempt. You know, I know, software issues and things are gonna you know. You fix one thing and you break 10, you know, but that they already at least trying to move a step in the right direction, and they told her the beginning, I have allergies – I'm not crying. It's nice to know that they can. You know, they're trying. And that's all you can kinda ask for.

> P4: But I think one of them things until everything's fixed would be an easy fix. Is them to put to go in an incognito tab, because, like. A lot of things, and I don't think a lot of people will know to kind of know how to do that. So maybe if they can put a link in there, instead of like redoing the whole system. They do like it's, I think, dealing with software companies. And you know, sometimes they take the system that they have, and they're like, Oh, it doesn't work, and they throw it all out, and then we'll start all over with a new system. And then everybody has to learn the new system, and then the system is more broke than it was on the first one. So, like. The system that they kind of have going. Now. Yeah, that's better than trashing everything and starting over so hopefully they don't have to go that extreme that they could just fix a few things on it. But I think the system is good overall, like it is nice to be able to just to go online and do what you need to do instead of having to call center and get routed stuff like that. So it's good to hear they're yeah trying to make changes.

Tyler: For sure. Awesome.

Tyler: Well, thank you so much, [P4]. I hope you have a lovely rest of your Tuesday. I'll see you later.

> P4: Alright, thanks so much. I hope I can do something to help.

Tyler: Good, good to hear. Alright, take care bye.
