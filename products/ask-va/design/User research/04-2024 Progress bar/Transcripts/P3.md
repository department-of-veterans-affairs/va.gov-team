### Warm up

Tyler: Alright, so I'd like to confirm. Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio?

> P3: Yes.

Tyler: Awesome. At this point, do you have any questions for me?

> P3: No.

Tyler: Okay, well, let's go ahead and get started.

Tyler: you started talking to me a little bit about your experience with my healthevet secure messaging and your primary care provider, which you said was mostly positive.

Tyler: How long have you been interacting with the VA? Or using VA healthcare?

> P3: So I originally got my final rating... Let's see, so I retired in 2008. So I got my final rating, probably in early [year]. And I would say ever since then I've been affiliated with the VA of some sorts.

Tyler: Okay. Great. And it sounds like you get in touch with the VA over secure messaging, do you ever get in touch with the VA another way, like, maybe over the phone?

> P3: Yeah. I do. I call whenever I have like questions, like appointments outside of my normal provider. I think I have an appointment coming up at some point, and it got cancelled, and there was some confusion. The doctor was, gonna be out of town or whatever. And so, yeah, no, I do phone them, actually, quite often.

Tyler: Okay, gotcha. And what about outside of healthcare. I can tell, you're interacting with the VA for your healthcare. But what about like, maybe when you're getting your disability rating, or any other sorts of contact with the VA...

> P3: Yeah, so I am involved in a lot of community stuff where I live at. And so I often come across Veterans who may, let's say, are seeking, you know, help trying to find different type of information. Medical records, some of filing for disability claims. I'm affiliated with the DAV. So I had buddies that I refer people to that to try to help them get their VA claims. So I mean it is, it's different kind of stuff that I contact the VA about. And actually, I mean, unfortunately, I have a rotary. A friend of mine who had a son just committed suicide. He was a vet and so I connected him with the social worker that I know here in our local outpatient clinic.

Tyler: Okay. So it sounds like, you're a connector for a lot of different people, and probably have a lot of knowledge about how to get in touch with different parts of the VA.

> P3: Yeah.

Tyler: Have you ever heard of Ask VA? Or AVA?

> P3: No.

Tyler: Well, that's all good. We're gonna be talking a little bit about that today.

Tyler: Let's go ahead and get set up now with the prototype. Okay? And if there's anything you want to share about your experience as we go along, we can continue to chat through that.

Tyler: So since you're on your phone. This sometimes takes a moment, so you'll have to bear with me. But I'm gonna send a link in the chat on Zoom. When I do that, it's gonna pop up on your screen. And if you can click on that link... Let me know when you've done that.

> P3: Alright figma.com.

Tyler: Okay, so you're seeing Figma now. Perfect. So now we're gonna have to come back to the Zoom window. And what we're going to do is we're going to share your screen. So, depending on your phone, you might see a button at the top or the bottom that says share screen. And if you're not seeing that, then let me know what you're seeing.

Tyler: How's that going?

Tyler: [P3]? Can you hear me?

Tyler: Hmm. I just want to check if you can hear me still. Oh, okay. All right.

[P3 drops from the call]

[P3 rejoins the call]

Tyler: Hello [P3]! Can you hear me?

Tyler: Oh, no. This time I can't hear you. I think maybe you've joined. Maybe you can nod...

Tyler: Okay, perfect.

> P3: Somehow. I yeah. Somehow, I got disconnected.

Tyler: Yeah, I noticed that as well.

Tyler: That's not a problem. You're back now, and you can hear me right?

> P3: Yes.

Tyler: Okay, I can hear you, and I can see you as well.

Tyler: So what we can do is we can try this again where I can have you open the Figma link on your phone and share it on Zoom, or I can share it on my screen. What do you prefer? Do you want to try and give it a go? One more time.

> P3: Yeah, I'm doing share now.

Tyler: Okay let's try that.

> P3: Gonna just go back to the chat and do it again.

Tyler: Okay. Do you want me to send it again, or you've got it there?

> P3: Yeah. Send it again.

Tyler: Okay. That should pop up again now.

> P3: I got it.

Tyler: Perfect. All right.

> P3: Are you seeing it?

Tyler: I'm not seeing it yet.

Tyler: It seems like maybe it's open on your screen, but it's not sharing yet. S it's now open and you're back on. Are you back on Zoom now?

> P3: Yep.

Tyler: Okay. So either on the top or the bottom of your screen, there's probably going to be something that says share screen. It depends.

Tyler: You see that? Okay. And then if you click on that, it's probably gonna ask you to to choose a window. What is it showing you now?

> P3: The different Microsoft One Drive Sharepoint Google drive.

> P3: It's looking for what I wanna share.

Tyler: Okay. Hmm. That's not ringing a bell for me. But let's see. Yeah, I'm not seeing your screen now.

> P3: Are you seeing it now?

Tyler: I'm not.

Tyler: Why don't we do this? Why don't I share my screen?

> P3: Okay.

Tyler: Is that okay with you? So if you come back to the zoom.

> P3: Yep, I'm back.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So you're gonna just look at the screen. And basically, as we go along, I'm gonna ask you, like things like, where would you click and I'll click where you want me to? Okay, alright. So let's pull this up.

> P3: Yeah.

Tyler: You can see that on your end. Now.

> P3: Yes, yeah, I had that on my end as well.

Tyler: Yeah, yeah. Sorry about that. It's always tricky with phones, and it's hard, because I can't see exactly what you're seeing. But this will do exactly what we need it to do this way.

> P3: Okay.

### Homepage to sign in

Tyler: Okay. Awesome. So now we're all set up and for the rest of our conversation. Actually let me pause. I'm gonna give you a moment to look at this page. Okay, and tell me if you want me to scroll down or anything, and what I'd love for you to do is tell me what you're noticing first.

> P3: I mean, that seems kind of self-explanatory. For someone who's used to navigating. I mean, I know there's a lot of old Veteran guys that are kind of forced to use technology these days.

Tyler: Yeah. So what do you feel like this page is about?

> P3: I think it kind of gives you an overview of what you may find on this site. Education benefits, work and debt. And here's how to sign in.

> P3: An older person... I mean, I would continue to probably just navigate, navigate, navigate until I find out what I'm looking for. But someone older may be looking for something different. And they will probably think that this is not it, or get frustrated.

> P3: I mean, I would just keep clicking, clicking until I find what I'm looking for. So I don't know if there's any other bullet to add about any other possible services they may be able to get from this site. I mean, I know you're limited at you just can't put a bunch of bullets. But I mean, it seems to be centered around benefits.

Tyler: Okay, it's centered around benefits. It might take a bit of thinking, especially for an older person to figure out what this is about. That's helpful.

Tyler: Okay, yep.

Tyler: So for the rest of our conversation today.

Tyler: We're gonna pretend, like, you need to ask the VA a question. Okay?

Tyler: So let's say, you'd like to learn whether you're eligible for Post 9/11 GI Bill benefits.

Tyler: Are you familiar with the GI bill?

> P3: Yes.

Tyler: Okay, cool. Well, for the benefit of everybody on the call, the Post 9/11 GI Bill helps you pay for school or job training. So people who served on active duty after September 10th, 2001 might qualify for these education benefits.

Tyler: And so, [P3], I'm gonna remind you of this scenario as we go along. But that's what we're here to do today. Okay, we're putting ourselves in that in that scenario.

Tyler: Can you tell me what you would do first on this page if you wanted to ask the VA a question?

> P3: I would continue to scroll down to see how I actually could reach someone about my specific question. Probably I would go through probably the entire scope of the entire page, just to gauge on where I would need to go to ask my question.

> P3: And then I, if I, then I would probably come back to signing in or creating an account, if I didn't find my answer readily available.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: So you're looking right now. You're looking for a place where you could ask your question. And you're not seeing it yet?

> P3: No.

Tyler: Right. And then so...

> P3: Hey, what about faqs?

> P3: Can you scroll down a little bit more?

Tyler: Yeah. Let's see.

> P3: See there's no... I don't see an FAQ. Or is there?

Tyler: Yeah, I'm not seeing an FAQ either.

Tyler: So this is helpful. It feels like we're not exactly sure to where to begin.

> P3: Yeah, kind of having to figure out, okay, what do I do next? And you gonna just start clicking on stuff. And then someone's gonna get frustrated.

Tyler: Yeah, okay, so not super clear. And you said you'd come back up to this sign in or create an account. Would you choose to sign in this scenario, or would you choose to continue without signing in?

> P3: Honestly, I probably would choose to continue to look around for a while and hope that I found something. And at some point maybe go ahead and sign in or create an account. But again, that would probably be frustrating. You're looking for a quick answer.

Tyler: Yeah, okay.

> P3: And so everything with the VA seems to not be quick.

Tyler: Yeah, so immediately this doesn't feel like, I'm gonna get a quick answer, and you almost want to avoid having to sign in, right?

> P3: Yeah, yeah.

Tyler: Why do you feel like you want to avoid signing in?

> P3: It just adds another layer of doing something, you know, when you're when you're looking for something, you want an answer pretty quick. And most of the folks I know, they're looking for. Okay, and they think it's eat. Now don't get me wrong. I know that the VA can only do so much to make it easy for everybody generically. But a lot of the guys. I know they would have issues or difficulties, maybe signing in or creating. They'll have to get someone to do it for them. That's what a lot of people do now.

> P3: But at some point, after looking and seeing and not getting that. Okay, here's really what I'm looking for. I would sign in or create an account. If I really need to find out what I'm find, what I'm looking for.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense.

Tyler: So it's like, not immediately clear where to start. And signing in is not always easy, especially for different people.

> P3: It's not gonna be my first thing that I want to do. I'm not gonna just go to the middle and sign in and create an account. Because what am I creating it for?

Tyler: That makes a lot of sense. What about this link that says, continue without signing in?

> P3: I would probably do that.

Tyler: Yeah. Did you notice that link before?

> P3: I did, and I probably would click on that. Just see where it takes me before I create an account.

Tyler: Okay, well, let's start there. And we'll say we're not exactly sure what to do. We're just gonna start clicking things. And at least this way, we don't have to sign in.

Tyler: Okay, I'll click on continue without signing in.

Tyler: Alright, and then describe what we're looking at here.

> P3: What is the 5% complete?

Tyler: I'm gonna do the annoying thing and not answer your question. But, so you notice that right away, and you...

> P3: And feel like it...

Tyler: And you're not really sure what it's about?

> P3: Yes, like, is that gonna hamper me from finding out what I need to? If it's not 100% complete?

Tyler: Okay, so it's not clear what what it's there for and it's, maybe a little bit worrisome that it's only 5%.

> P3: Yes, like do I have to have it totally completed before I eventually get to my answer?

Tyler: Right that makes sense.

Tyler: And what else are we seeing on this page?

> P3: Yeah. So we're back to the sign in. So at some point, I'm thinking that, yeah, I'm gonna have to do a sign in by now.

Tyler: Okay. So in this scenario where you're here to ask whether you're eligible for Post 9/11 GI Bill benefits, do you think you need to sign in?

> P3: Yeah.

Tyler: Do you know exactly why? Or are you just getting a sense?

> P3: Just getting a sense that what I'm reading I mean, this is the second page that I've seen now, and it's talking about signing in. So in my mind, I'm thinking, yeah, at some point, I'm gonna have to create an account.

Tyler: Yeah, well, let's go ahead and pretend like, you were gonna fill us in knowing that, you might have to sign in at some point. Okay. So I'm gonna open this so that you can see what we're looking at here.

Tyler: So in this scenario, can you tell me what you would choose here?

> P3: For information about the post 9/11? Probably the first one.

Tyler: The first one.

> P3: Yeah.

Tyler: Okay, we'll choose that one.

Tyler: So we'll say we chose education benefits, and then we'll click continue.

Tyler: Okay. And then what are we seeing here?

> P3: Yeah. So yeah, you're gonna have to sign in you, you're pretty much forcing someone to sign in.

Tyler: Yeah. So you kind of guessed that before we clicked, continue, you kind of felt, like, this would happen.

> P3: Yeah, yeah, I've seen it twice now. And it's right kind of in your face.

Tyler: Yeah. Why do you think the VA wants you to sign in?

> P3: I'm sure to collect data. And identify who you are.

Tyler: Yeah, so collect data, identify who you are.

> P3: And maybe personalize your service. I don't, you know, I don't know if for me, if I signed in, it would tell me if I'm eligible or not for post 9/11 GI Bill benefits? Or is it gonna give me the generic definition of what you have to be to be eligible? Is it gonna be personal enough for [P3]?

> P3: You understand what I'm saying.

Tyler: I do. Yeah.

Tyler: So you're not totally sure if you signed in, if it would say, You know, [P3] is eligible for GI Bill benefits, or if you'd have to go do something else. What signing in would actually offer. Yeah, that makes sense. When you, when you use my healthevet secure messaging do you have to sign in?

> P3: Yes.

Tyler: Why do you have to sign in for that? Why do you think?

> P3: As a means of tracking my communications. And again, for data.

Tyler: Okay.

> P3: And I'm fine with that. I mean, I'm comfortable, you know, with the whole my healthevet signing in thing I mean, I know that's what I have to do. So I'm okay with that.

Tyler: Yeah, well, that's super helpful. So what we're gonna do here is we're gonna pretend like you said, Okay fine. You know, I'm gonna sign in. Okay. And so you clicked on sign in.

Tyler: So now we're seeing this screen. Does this look familiar to you?

> P3: Yes.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: And so we're not gonna actually sign in for this research session. But what we'll do is we'll pretend like you signed in. Okay, so we'll pretend like you clicked on login.gov, and then you put in your email address and your password. And you did the whole thing. Okay? And we'll click login. Okay? So now we're seeing this screen. So we've signed in and we're back at this screen.

Tyler: Tell me what we're seeing here.

### Through to submission

> P3: It looks like, okay. So I'm here now. I can ask my question. And so I would probably start, you know, clicking on some of these. But I'm not sure again how generic these are. Is it to me, or is it in general?

Tyler: Right, okay. So you don't know if it's going to be like an FAQ kind of page for example.

> P3: Yeah.

Tyler: Right. That's helpful. So why don't we click on, Ask a new question. Let's say that was what you were gonna try out first.

Tyler: Does that feel like what you might click on?

> P3: Yeah, yeah.

Tyler: Alright, we'll click on that. And then describe this page to me. What are we seeing here?

> P3: So again, that 5% catches my eye. I'm a little worried about okay, so what does this 5% mean? Am I not going to get my question in if I'm not at a hundred percent?

> P3: I would probably just go down to the category and see what the options are there. And that's where we were before. So it kind of takes you back.

Tyler: Yeah. Why do you think you have to go back?

> P3: I don't know. I thought what we did before to the Login.gov was taking me closer to what I was looking for.

Tyler: Yeah. So it's surprising that you have to do this question again, yeah.

Tyler: And you notice that 5% again, okay, well. We'll click on education benefits. Okay?

> P3: Yep.

Tyler: And then we'll click continue.

Tyler: And now we're on a new page. So tell me about this page.

> P3: So the 5 moved. I'm working towards something, whatever that might be.

> P3: I would probably, yeah, I would just jump down and select topic. See what that offered.

> P3: And Montgomery... post 9/11 chapter 33. It's probably where I would go now.

Tyler: Okay. I'll go ahead and click on that one.

Tyler: Okay, so we chose a category. We chose a topic. And now we'll click continue.

Tyler: And as we go through these screens, just tell me what you would click on these page and I'll click for you. Okay.

> P3: I would do I'm the veteran.

Tyler: Okay. Should I click continue?

> P3: Yes.

Tyler: Okay.

> P3: Yes [I'm a GI Bill beneficiary].

Tyler: GI bill beneficiary. And what makes you feel like you're a GI bill beneficiary in this scenario?

> P3: Well, the timeframe that I came in. I feel like I would be... Myself, I've exhausted mine. I was a professional student for a long time. But yeah, I would just knowing that I was enlisted during that timeframe. I would be eligible.

Tyler: Okay. So even if you're eligible and you hadn't use your benefits, you would know you're eligible. So you'd say, Yes. Okay that's helpful.

Tyler: So just ignore me as I click. No, okay, pretend like this isn't happening, and we'll pretend like you clicked. Yes, okay. And now we're on this screen. Tell me about this screen.

> P3: So 45% complete. Now, I'm getting somewhere.

> P3: I probably would wonder. So to me this is saying, okay, so do you have a school in mind? Or I would have a school in mind. But it's still doing a lot of stuff just for someone to see if they're eligible. You got to go through all of this to see if they're eligible? You know what I mean. You gotta go through a lot of stuff that may not even be relevant.

Tyler: Yeah. So it's surprising how many questions you're having to answer.

> P3: Yeah. It's going through a lot. I just wanna know, based on my name, my social security number. Am I eligible?

Tyler: Right. That's all you'd kind of expect to need to give. That makes sense.

Tyler: And on this page you mentioned, like the school you were thinking, okay, maybe that means it's because you have a school in mind.

> P3: Yeah.

Tyler: Do you have to give your school on this page?

> P3: It seems so. I mean it seems so. What if you don't have a school? What if you don't... What if you just again just calling in to see, am I eligible? Because a friend told me I was.

Tyler: Right.

> P3: Now you're gonna have to go in and put in these hypothetical situations.

Tyler: Right.

Tyler: So would you kind of just guess. Let's say you were gonna push through. You wanted to get to the end. You might just guess.

> P3: Well get frustrated. One or the other.

Tyler: Yeah that makes sense. Well, let's pretend like you put in. You know, Virginia, you just said, okay, I'm just gonna put something in here.

> P3: Okay.

Tyler: And then we'll click continue.

Tyler: And now tell me about this page.

> P3: So now I'm thinking alright. So finally, am I able to ask the specific question that I wanna ask. Is what I see here.

Tyler: Yeah. And you said finally.

> P3: Yeah.

Tyler: Yeah. Did it feel like it took a while for you to get to this?

> P3: Yeah, I mean I me. I probably would have, you know, I would have clicked my way through quicker. But, like said, a lot of lot of folks. You know, they may not be technically savvy. Get frustrated, maybe. Try to call the 827100 number and that takes like forever.

> P3: But at this point I'm thinking, like, okay, I finally get to ask my question. It gives you, it's free text. So I get to ask my question, centered around me. It's not a drop down.

Tyler: And, is that a good thing or a bad thing?

> P3: That's a good thing.

Tyler: Yeah. Why is that a good thing?

> P3: Cause I need to know about me. And each, you know most people have, you know, in to a certain degree, it falls into the same category of questions that people ask generically. But I wanted it to be about me, about my question.

Tyler: Right. Yeah, that makes sense. So you don't wanna know, like, generally speaking, who's eligible for this, you wanna know, am I, [P3] eligible for this? Yeah.

> P3: Yeah, yeah.

Tyler: I get that. That makes sense.

Tyler: And so we're seeing subject. And it says, What's your question? And then we've got select files to upload. Do you feel like you have to upload a file?

> P3: No. I'm curious what I would upload with. It didn't prompt me before. Anyway. I don't remember seeing that I may have to upload anything. So I'm curious to know. What would I upload? My DD214? Yeah, I'm just curious. What? And why would I have to upload something?

> P3: My natural thought says it would be my DD214, only because I know that they use that to qualify you, for you know stuff.

Tyler: Yeah, but without them explaining to you what to upload, you would be a little bit guessing?

> P3: Yeah, like. What am I supposed uploading? Why would I upload something?

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: Alright. Well, let's pretend, like you wrote in a subject you wrote in a little bit of a question, and then. And then you continued, okay?

> P3: Yeah.

Tyler: Alright. And now we're on this page.

Tyler: And so we're gonna pretend like this page is filled in with your information. So let's pretend like, instead of saying, Hector, it, said, [P3], okay?

Tyler: And for the rest of the page, same sort of thing. So why is the information filled in already.

> P3: I guess at some point it just transferred from when I signed in?

Tyler: Yeah. Has that happened before for you using VA.gov?

> P3: Not that I can remember. No.

Tyler: Yeah. So you think your information is probably here cause you signed in?

> P3: Yep.

Tyler: And then if you wanted to change your information here. Let's say, like your preferred name, you know you used to go by James, and now you go by [P3]. So you actually wanna remove your preferred name.

Tyler: How would you do that? Can you tell me how you do that?

> P3: Well. I mean, first thing I probably would do is to maybe put the cursor in that box. And if that didn't work I would look for some type of edit option.

Tyler: Okay. Yeah.

Tyler: Well, let's say you edited it. So you put the cursor there and you could change it.

Tyler: Would that change your information anywhere else for the VA?

> P3: I would think it would. That things are connected. I would think so.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense.

Tyler: So I'm going to keep scrolling down. Let me know, if anything else stands out to you

Tyler: And then otherwise, I'm going to go ahead and continue.

Tyler: Okay. So we'll continue onto the next page.

Tyler: And what are we seeing on this page?

> P3: Now I'm at 80%. So now I'm thinking that it's again leading to something. I mean, it's verified my personal information. And I got to ask the specific question I wanted to.

Tyler: So we're feeling a little bit better now?

> P3: Yeah.

Tyler: A little bit better. And do you still, do you feel like you know what's gonna happen at the end of this?

> P3: No.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: Okay so we're at 80%. We've got contact information here. It looks like this has already been filled in.

Tyler: Do you have any questions about this page?

> P3: No, I mean, finish this question later. Does that mean that I could do that on all of them, and just get to the end and submit my question? IS that what finish this question later means?

Tyler: Hmm. That's a good question.

> P3: That you could blow through these if you didn't want to take the time? Just finish the question, this was on the previous screen. I'm pretty sure it was.

Tyler: Yeah, we can go back and have a look.

Tyler: So we've got finished this question, yeah.

> P3: So a lot of people probably just blow through these with that.

Tyler: Hmm, okay. So you're thinking, maybe you can click on this, and you just do that on every page, and you get straight through to the end. Faster. Yeah.

> P3: Yeah.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense.

Tyler: What about this green right here. What is this showing? It says we've saved your progress.

> P3: Yeah, I saw that a couple of screens ago. So again, someone's tracking what I'm doing. For whatever reason.

Tyler: Okay. So not super clear, like kind of why or who or how that's happening?

> P3: Yeah.

Tyler: Yeah, okay. We'll click continue on this one. Okay, so we're on this screen. Tell me what you're seeing here.

> P3: I mean. Seems to me again someone's taken some... This attempt to get some demographic information of why I contacted them.

> P3: And does this question even matter? I mean. If you just had a question, I mean, does any of these other bullets, or do they make sense of adding? And why is this? Why is this page here, anyway?

Tyler: Yeah, I think that's a good question. So this feels a little bit out of place especially cause it's about asking a question.

> P3: Right.

Tyler: Yeah, I can totally see that.

Tyler: All right, let's click. I had a question.

Tyler: And we'll just get ourselves through that one. And now what are we seeing on this page.

> P3: So if you click on your question the positive, that give that will take me to my actual question. Is what I'm thinking. Is that true?

Tyler: Yeah, okay. So I'm not gonna answer your question just yet. But does it feel a little bit unsure?

> P3: I'm thinking that this is the final review, probably to make sure that this is I do. Have I said, and asked what I wanted to add. And it gives me a chance to correct any, you know, just to double check my question is what I'm guessing.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: So do you feel like when you get to this point, you're reviewing your information. You would want to review your question. You'd wanna make sure you wrote your question in right?

> P3: Yeah.

Tyler: Yeah. That makes sense.

Tyler: Well, just for your understanding. If you clicked the plus. It would open up so you could see your question.

> P3: Okay.

Tyler: Okay. But the purpose of this page felt clear. It felt like it was to review your information. It sounds like.

> P3: Yeah.

Tyler: Well, let's go ahead and scroll. We'll say you were reviewing your information. Everything was looking good, and you're ready to submit. Okay.

Tyler: so I'm gonna click submit question.

Tyler: And now it looks like we're here. I'll give you a couple of minutes to read this and then let me know what this page is telling you.

> P3: Well, it's saying that. Okay, so now they have my... it's giving me confirmation that my question was submitted.

> P3: And a reference number. So where's this reference number gonna be? Am I supposed to write this down? Is it gonna be sent to a profile? My Yahoo?

Tyler: Right. So throughout this process it's been a little unclear what to expect at the end. Do you feel like you're more clear on what to expect now, or you still have questions?

> P3:So I asked my question. But 7 business days. Like, historically, nothing seems to work really fast with the VA. But 7 business days is long. Most people are more desperate than that.

Tyler: Right. Did you have an idea that it might take 7 business days, or what were you hoping for?

> P3: Kind of. No, I was. I was honestly hoping for some interactive – in the best case scenario – interactive question and answer. In the best case scenario.

Tyler: Yeah. What would an interactive question and answer kind of feel like? Can you talk me through that?

> P3: Like, you know, when you go to different sites, they have these, you can type in, and they give, you know, generic answers, but at least you can get an idea of the question you're asking. The little pop-ups. It's automated. It's not a live person, but it's automated. And sometimes they put you in a ballpark of what you're looking for.

Tyler: Okay. So a little bit of...

> P3: That would have been ideal, because in my mind I now can kind of figure out if I am, or am not eligible for something.

Tyler: Right. So you're kind of like having a back and forth quote unquote conversation, learning a little bit more. Versus this.

> P3: I'm still in limbo now. I'm still in limbo now. For 7 days.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. That feels like a let down, especially when you weren't really sure what to expect at the end. And then you were like, Oh, it's this.

> P3: Yeah. And I go through all these clicks, these different information gathering sessions. It's more like they were trying to find out about me.

Tyler: Versus you trying to learn something.

> P3: Yeah.

Tyler: Yeah, I can totally see that. Yeah.

Tyler: That makes a lot of sense. So what I'm gonna do, [P3], we've reached the end of the prototype. So I'm gonna stop sharing my screen.

Tyler: And then we'll just chat for the last we got about 15 min or so.

### Cool down

Tyler: We've already started reflecting on the process. We talked about some of the things that were pretty confusing just overall. I'm curious if there was anything about the process that you liked, or you'd want to keep?

> P3: I like the free text. I can ask the specific question about my situation.

> P3: What I don't like again is kind of going around the world to come back and then when I get there, it's telling me I got 7 days to get an answer.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: That makes a lot of sense. And the free text is more like what you described when you talked about an interactive Q and A yeah. I get that.

Tyler: Is this tool something that you feel like you would use?

> P3: Probably not. In hindsight? Probably not. I feel like most of the people I know, that's kind of they want an answer quick. People want like right away. And I know that is not always possible. I get it. I totally understand that. But again, is there a better way to give me something than 7 days. Can I get something quicker?

Tyler: Yeah. that makes sense. Like, it was interesting to me that you might even prefer more generic information if it was immediate versus waiting 7 business days.

> P3: Yeah. So in my mind, let me kind of figure my scenario based on these generic guidelines. For me to continue doing what I'm trying to do or not.

Tyler: I think that makes a lot of sense.

Tyler: And we talked a little bit about sign in and how it was like kind of confusing, because you didn't think you had to sign in. But you might have to sign in, and then you definitely had to.

Tyler: Why did you think any of that happened? Did it make sense? Why you had to sign in?

Tyler: Does that make any sense in hindsight?

> P3: I would suspect that it is tracking who I am and the questions I have. And I'll be able to get, at some point, reference what I was asking. But I wasn't thinking about that when I was having to do that.

Tyler: Yeah, when you started that wasn't as clear.

> P3: Yeah.

Tyler: What about if we compare this to secure messaging? Does this feel at all similar to secure messaging?

> P3: Not really. I mean secure messaging, I'm click, click, 2 clicks, 3 clicks. And I'm there. I mean, this okay, this is different. You're asking a question. But it was like we had to click 6 7 times.

Tyler: Right. You have to give more information up front?

> P3: Yeah.

Tyler: Let's talk about one specific thing that we saw on the form. So you noticed that 5% pretty quickly, and then you saw you mentioned it a few times as it change throughout the form.

Tyler: Do you feel like that was helpful, or did you feel like that was unhelpful? How did you feel about that?

> P3: I felt kind of unknown. I mean, I knew it had to be taking me up to 100%. And so, I'm figuring that. Okay, how many more of these? So now every time I click continue, I'm looking at. How far did it advance me?  Oh, I saw 45%. I think once it jumped to 80% or something. So I'm wondering, at what point am I coming to the end of this?

Tyler: Right. So you're trying to kind of like learn like, oh, it moves pretty quickly, or it moves pretty slowly to give yourself a better idea?

> P3: Yeah.

Tyler: Do you think it's helpful to know your percentage? Or how far you are along in the process or unhelpful?

> P3: In hindsight, I think I do. I think I wanna know how close I'm am. Like, how long is this actually gonna take me. It was just in the beginning, I was like wow. Okay. There is a percentage that's leading up to something. So it's kind of surprising in the beginning, but in hindsight I guess it's good to know how far, how far along you are.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. Like at the beginning it was a little bit more... you had a little bit of worry about like being only 5%. And then, as you got as you got further on, you were like, alright, this seems like it will end at some point.

> P3: Yeah, yeah.

Tyler: That makes sense.

Tyler: I'm curious like, what if, as you were filling this out as you were working through the form, something came up like you had to take a phone call.

Tyler: Would you be able to save your progress like save your question and come back to it later? What do you? What's your impression?

> P3: Well the green tab said auto saved. And so I'll, you know my eyes navigate, you know, up and down, and I would think that it was saved somehow, automatically for me.

Tyler: Yeah. How would get back?

> P3: I don't know, because I mean we didn't go through that. If I had to leave, would it prompt me? How would it prompt me... your session had expired? You know I don't know what the next steps of next prompts would be. But it appeared that it did auto save after 2 or 3 min or so.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense. So you remember that little green blurb that we read. But it's not totally clear how to get back to that unfinished question. Yeah.

Tyler: Well, [P3], I think you've answered all my questions. You've been super helpful in explaining what was confusing and what was helpful and how you would change things. I do want to leave a little bit of time in case you have questions for me. They could be questions about what we just looked at or what we talked about, or you know what we're doing in terms of doing research.

> P3: Yeah, no, I think I'm good. I mean, I'm, you know, optimistic that the VA is spending time to see how they can make things easier for that. It's just seems that things, you know don't always go as, and I know that you just can't... Everything just cannot be like readily at your disposal. I mean, I just think as Americans, that's what we expect. But I'm okay with it.

Tyler: Yeah. Well, I think you gave us a lot of good things to think about and ways we could probably make this a little more efficient as you said. So I appreciate it. And we really appreciate your time. Everybody on the call, I'm sure, would agree.

Tyler: And so I think that's the end of our session. The folks who set up the session from Perigean, they're gonna send you a thank you note. It should look familiar to you because you've worked with them before. And they'll be the ones that if you have any questions about payment or participating in the future, you can reach out to them.

Tyler: But otherwise I hope you have a lovely rest of your day.

> P3: All right. Thank you likewise.

Tyler: Thank you. Bye.

> P3: Bye.
