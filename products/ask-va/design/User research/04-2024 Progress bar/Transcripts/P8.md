### Warm up

Tyler: Okay. So now that the recording has started, I just wanna confirm that you're okay. If I record my screen and audio today?

> P8: Yes, confirm. It's okay.

Tyler: Awesome. Well, thank you. That was a lot of information. I wanna check in and make sure you don't have any questions for me at this point?

> P8: Cracking so far.

Tyler: Okay, awesome.

Tyler: Well, before we get some of your feedback on what we're working on, I'd love to just learn a little bit more about you and your experience with the Va. I'm curious how long you've been a Veteran.

> P8: I got out of the military in 2014. So trying to do the math, oh, 10 years

> P8: And I previously worked at the VA. In [City], [State], and then here in [City], [State], I use the VA for my healthcare and benefits. I used to go get the post 911 GI Bill. So I use them for a lot.

Tyler: Awesome. Okay, cool. So you've got experience with healthcare benefits, but also with education benefits. That that's really helpful. And it also sounds like you worked for the VA. What kind of area were you working? Were you working in person at a center?

> P8: Yes, in [City]. I was a what did they call it? A work study student. So doing a lot of what they needed. But here in [City] I was a clinical psychologist.

Tyler: Awesome. Well, that's very cool. I think that's an awesome perspective to have to help give us some feedback. When you've kind of been in touch with the VA over the years, setting up healthcare and getting your Gi bill benefits. Are you usually contacting the VA like by going in person? Or were you ever calling the VA or going online?

> P8: Most often calling and going online. If it's VA medical things I know I'll need then I'll go in in person. But for the vast majority of stuff I use the website.

Tyler: On the website. Do you ever use like the chatbot, or do any sort of type of messaging?

> P8: I recently did messaging you know the chatbot but I'm struggling to remember what it was, for. It might have been something with retirement benefits. So. But most often, if I can't figure it out, then I'll call because I struggle with the website.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. Well, it'll be helpful for me to hear ways that maybe you're struggling with the website, or that it's not working well for you. But let's shift gears and we'll start to get you set up with this prototype so we can get your feedback. So I think you're on your computer. Is that alright?

> P8: Yes.

Tyler: Okay, awesome. So I'm gonna send you a link to a prototype. It's gonna come through the zoom chat. And then once you get that if you can, if you can open the link on your side and just let me know once it's loaded. So I just sent the link in the chat.

> P8: It's loading. Okay, here we go. It's up.

Tyler: Okay, perfect. And then I'm gonna have you share your screen on. Zoom. Have you done that before?

> P8: Yes, it's been updated since I've used it last, but I got it.

Tyler: Awesome. If you need a reminder, you need any help. Just let me know.

> P8: Should I share the full screen or just the window?

### Homepage to sign in

Tyler: You can just share the window... Perfect. Okay, cool. So now I'm seeing this tab that says, Ask VA.

Tyler: Awesome. So we're not going to click on anything yet.

Tyler: But I'm gonna give you a moment to look around. You're welcome to scroll on the page, and as you're doing this, I'd love for you to tell me what you're noticing first.

> P8: Alright.

> P8: I see that in order to get answers to almost anything I have to sign in in my account, which is understandable, but that in and of itself can be frustrating.

> P8: I've tried to log into my ID.me to get into the VA and I wasn't able to. It had me. I prove that I'm a human using video. And it said that I'm not a human.

> P8: And it wouldn't let me log in so instantly. Seeing the sign in or created an account makes me. It's very easy. But that's how I have to what I have to do to access the answers.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense so immediately. You're noticing that for most any question you need to sign in. And your experience with signing into VA websites hasn't been easy.

Tyler: Are there other questions that you can ask on this website without signing in?

> P8: I see down here, it says, continue without signing in.

> P8: So I don't know what... Do I click?

Tyler: Let's hold off clicking. Yeah. But yes, we will click eventually.

Tyler: Yeah. So do you think that's something that you would try if you don't want to sign in or?

> P8: Yes, I would try it. Although I'm – based on the screen – I don't know what it will be able to answer without me signing in. I see that I have to sign in to ask a lot of these things, so I don't know what I would be able to access.

Tyler: Right. So it feels like, even if you don't really want to sign in, you're also thinking that you might actually have to sign in to do a lot of the stuff you want to do. Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: If you were, gonna ask a question through this website, how long would you expect it to take to ask your question, and then receive your reply from the VA?

> P8: Okay, I would go to find other ways to contact us... I don't know, if I would just looking at this website. I don't think I would go into it ask a question online when... Just in this format, I would most likely go to find other ways to contact us.

> P8: I wouldn't know what a reference number, what reference, what number would be considered a reference number on anything, so I would most likely call.

Tyler: Okay, so to make, sure, I'm understanding, does it feel like you don't know where to start, if you wanted to ask your question online. And that's why you would give them a call?

> P8: Yes. Yeah. [I don't know where to start to I would call.]

Tyler: That's really helpful. I can see why it feels that way.

Tyler: So for the rest of our conversation today, what we're gonna do is, we're gonna pretend, like you need to ask the VA a question. And we're gonna say, I know you mentioned your post 9 11 GI bill benefits. We're gonna say that you want to figure out if you're eligible for Post 911 GI bill benefits. So I know you're familiar with the GI Bill just for the purpose of other folks on the call, the post 911 GI Bill helps you pay for school or job training, and people who served on active duty after September 10th, 2001 might qualify for these education benefits.

Tyler: So, I'm gonna remind you of this scenario as needed as we go along. But for today, let's just continue to think that's what we're here to do. We're here to ask a question about whether or not we're eligible. So if that was the case, it sounds like you might try and call for the purpose of this session. Let's say that you had to try and ask a question on this page. Do you know where else you might try and click.

> P8: That's not. That's your question... Get answers.

> P8: I think I would go to the continue without signing in. To see if I could type it in question. There.

Tyler: Okay, well, let's go ahead and do that. Let's click on. Continue without signing in.

> P8: And see it might be required. Your question is about education benefits. Then you need to sign in. So okay, based on that, I would, admittedly [be] pretty frustrated.

Tyler: Because knowing you'd have to sign in and kind of thinking about that? Yeah.

> P8: Yes, yes, if I wanted to just understand basics of what makes someone eligible, or what the eligibility criteria is, I would want to be able to see that. But I understand. If I want to know whether I, as an individual, still have any education benefits left, I would have to give them my info.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense. So you're kind of feeling like, if i'm not gonna sign in, i should still be able to get general information about this? And yeah, that makes sense. And if you did sign in, then, yeah, it could be more personalized. Okay, so if you got to this point, and you saw this thing that said, you know sign in might be required, because your questions about education. Where? What would you do now?

> P8: See, I would see if it... I would. I can scroll. There we go.

> P8: I would go here to education benefits, and I would see what they do have available.

Tyler: Okay. You can go ahead and continue to... perfect.

Tyler: Okay.

> P8: It says you need to sign in.

> P8: I see that I need to sign in so that they can address my individual benefits, and what I've got left.

Tyler: Right. So you're kind of expecting this basically from the first page you've been like, they probably want me to sign in. But I really would prefer not to. And it just kinda keeps telling you, okay, cool. So it's frustrating to have to sign in. But you are feeling clear that. That's it wasn't surprising to you that they said you need to sign.

> P8: Correct. Yeah, yeah.

Tyler: That makes sense. Okay. Well, let's say that you decided, okay, I'm gonna keep going with this. I'm gonna sign in, because that's what they want me to do so we'll go ahead and click on sign in.

### Through to submission

Tyler: And then we're not gonna actually sign in today, so you can take a sigh of relief. But we're gonna pretend like we're typing in your username, we're putting in your password. We're doing the whole thing. So if you click on login.gov. Perfect. And then just imagine that we've signed in now. Okay, so now, what are we seeing?

> P8: Now I see, ask a new question.

Tyler: Okay. And you found that pretty quickly immediately clicked on it. So that felt like it was, it was clear, okay, now. Now where are we?

> P8: Now it looks like we're back here choosing the category. So again I would go. Education benefits.

Tyler: So why don't you go ahead and click that? And then we'll stay on this page for a second, why do you feel like you had to answer that question again?

> P8: Inefficient system. I don't. I don't know other than that. Just that it didn't keep it in its memory.

Tyler: I don't know is always a good answer. But that makes sense it feels like probably it's inefficient and it's the system not remembering your previous response.

Tyler: cool. Let's go ahead and continue on.

Tyler: And then can you show me what you would do on this page?

> P8: I would look for specific topic and see if they have anything. There we go. There's the post 9 11 Gi. Bill.

Tyler: so you found that pretty quickly... And let's go ahead and click on that option.

Tyler: perfect. and yeah, you can continue on.

Tyler: And now tell me about this page.

> P8: This one I see a lot on the different VA websites and it's confirming whether I'm the veteran.

> P8: The final option, I'm surprised by that it is an option if someone logs into the VA, I'm assuming that they would most likely be the Veteran or someone connected to the Veteran, not, someone who's working as a school certifying official.

Tyler: okay, that makes sense. And you mentioned like working in work study when you're in [State]? And would in that case would you feel like you might use? I'm connected to the veteran through my work, or would this not be applicable?

> P8: If I were still currently working at the VA, that one would throw me off. Yet, for me it's easy, not working at the Medical Center the VA right now. But if I were, I would be unsure, whether to choose one or 3.

Tyler: That makes sense.

Tyler: Okay, well, let's choose number one, like you, said, in the first place, so we'll choose i'm the veteran. and then we'll go ahead and continue on to the next page.

Tyler: Okay, and in this scenario we are imagining that you're trying to figure out whether you're eligible for GI Bill benefits. So what do you think you would choose in that scenario?

> P8: If I wanted to see if I was eligible, I think I would choose, I'm not sure.

Tyler: Yeah, okay, cool. So that that makes sense. And I think a lot of people are agreeing with you. But for the prototype, we're gonna just have you click on no. But I can see why you would choose I'm not sure.

Tyler: So you can click on No. And then we'll continue.

Tyler: And on this next screen we're not actually going to click on anything. So maybe you can describe to me what you would do on this page.

> P8: Here I would choose Residency State, where I'm living in [State], and then for School State, I would, assuming that there is a a specific university or college that I have chosen already. And assuming that that school is not online, I would put that. But if I didn't have one already in mind, I would be frustrated by having to put something there for school State.

Tyler: Right. And it does it feel like that's required to put your school state.

> P8: Yes, it feels like school state is required. But Residency state is not.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. I can see why it's confusing to have to put a school state. So let's say, you just sort of like, put it in. You just said, Okay, [State], and then you and you went on to the next page. So you don't actually have to choose when you can just click continue.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: I think it's still loading. Right? Okay.

Tyler: Oh, there we go.

Tyler: So on this page, similar to the last page. Just describe to me what you would be doing if you landed on this.

> P8: If I came to here I would do... GI Bill eligibility. And for the question.

> P8: If I wanted to know if I am eligible, I would ask where I can find eligibility information? I might ask, can you just tell me if I'm eligible? But I wouldn't expect them to answer that that specifically.

Tyler: Just based on your experience with the VA in the past?

> P8: Yes, yes.

Tyler: Yeah. That makes sense.

Tyler: So we've gotten to this point where you're asking your question... Is this where you expected to ask your question at this point in the process?

> P8: No, I was expecting like a further narrowing down something that was a step in between the last step in this something that makes me feel more confident that my message would be getting to the right department.

Tyler: Okay, so you're feeling, like, you're, you're wanting to make sure that it's getting sent to the right person and that hasn't been clear.

> P8: Hasn't been clear.

Tyler: Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: Okay, well, let's pretend like we typed in that information just the way you described it to me. And then we'll go ahead and continue.

Tyler: And then for this page, we're going to pretend like it, says [P8], instead of Hector. And this is all your information. Okay.

Tyler: so why do you think this information is filled in already?

> P8: I'm assuming it's filled in because it pulled it from my profile when I logged in.

> P8: I was not expecting this at all. To come to this page with my information. I might have expected that before writing a question, but right now I'm confused, and I'm not certain whether my question was submitted when I just hit continue.

Tyler: That makes sense. So it's surprising that you are seeing this page at all and definitely surprising it's coming after you typed in your question. And that's helpful to understand that it's like, almost, it's very unreassuring. Because you're like, Well, where'd my question go? Yeah.

> P8: Yeah.

Tyler: That makes sense. And you said it was clear to you that this information was filled in cause, you signed in. Okay, well, I hear you on the confusion there. So let's click continue.

Tyler: And then, now we're on this page. Similarly, let's pretend like, it's your information. Let's say that you realize, like, you know, that's actually my old phone number. And I need to update my phone number on this page. Can you just describe to me how you would do that?

> P8: I would click in the phone number box, highlight it, delete it and type in my new phone number. Then hit continue.

Tyler: Cool. And then, if you did that, do you feel like your phone number would be updated anywhere else with the VA.

> P8: You know, I would like that, but I would not expect that.

Tyler: That makes sense.

Tyler: what if on this page, instead of being able to update your phone number here there was a link, and it said, You can go update your profile and you can change your phone number there and then you can come back to this page in the form. How would that make you feel?

> P8: I would prefer that. I would feel more confident that it was being updated across the VA's systems, across their platforms, rather than just updating in my healthevet, or whatever, the benefit site.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: Okay, cool. Well, let's say, you updated your phone number on this page and you can go ahead and continue.

Tyler: Okay. And now we're here. So tell me about this page.

> P8: To be honest. The first thing that comes to mind is what the f*ck. Like, to me that seems like something that would be at the very, very beginning. And if I had something anything other than a question I wouldn't have gone through here if I had something nice to say, I would not have thought, oh, let me log into my profile, go through select education benefits, and then go through all these other steps, type in a question, and then it's saying, I had a question after attending a town hall. That is a big surprise.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. This was surprising. And like, I'll paraphrase. But you described it quite well.

Tyler: Awesome. Okay. So this is confusing and surprising and out of place. So for now we'll just click on I had a question. And then we'll continue.

Tyler: So without clicking anything, can you describe this page to me?

> P8: I'm assuming this is where I actually submit the question. And I would have assumed that that was what would have happened right after I hit submit the question – or continue – after typing the question.

> P8: So I would be congratulating myself on actually following through and clicking all of the buttons afterwards. Otherwise I likely wouldn't have submitted it, [but would have] thought that I submitted it.

Tyler: so it was, it was like confusing to you that after you typed in your question, you kept going and you're like, well, then, was it submitted, or am I doing something extra? Now, what's going on? Yeah.

Tyler: yeah, that makes sense. And now you're reviewing your personal information on this page.

Tyler: do you feel like you would review your personal information.

> P8: Yes, yes.

Tyler: Awesome. Okay. Well, let's pretend like you did, and everything looked good, and we'll go ahead and submit the question.

> P8: And that's what a reference number is.

Tyler: Yes, there you go, and you brought that up early on. You were like I'm not sure what that is. When it was on that first page. Which totally makes sense.

Tyler: I'll give you a second to read this, and then let me know if anything else jumps out at you.

> P8: Glad that I'll receive an email confirmation. I would hope that that also has the reference number, and maybe a copy of the question.

> P8: Receiving a reply within 7 days seems standard for the VA. I would prefer sooner, of course, as would everyone. But I would think, like, okay, that's within expectations.

Tyler: that makes sense.

Tyler: So it's not surprising. But obviously, it would be it would be nice if it was quicker.

Tyler: Okay, well let's go ahead. You can stop sharing your screen now, and we have a bit of time to just kind of reflect on that process. Perfect so we went through this whole process, and I'm curious to hear kind of what you thought about it. Was there anything that you liked.

### Cool down

> P8: I love that that was in one place that I can ask about any VA question. I receive disability benefits as well. It's doing my healthcare and education and some other things through the VA. So, knowing that there is one centralized place, instead of having to go to the VBA or my healthevet site, that's something that I like. I'm glad that they have that grateful for that.

> P8: I still, I'm very curious about what types of answers they give. If the answers are, if you could get something like, Yes, you are eligible or no, you aren't eligible for this, but you are eligible for XYZ.

Tyler: Yeah, you're wondering, kinda like, how personalized it could be. And we talked about how your past experience with the VA would make you guess that it wouldn't be. That wouldn't be the answer you'd kinda end up with. What do you think you might expect to end up with.

> P8: [But] I would expect a like a templated email that says, if you'd like more information, go to this VA website and put in all of your service information. Put in your education information, and then we will tell you if you're eligible.

Tyler: Right. Okay, that makes sense.

Tyler: and besides, kind of like your expectation for the response you would get is there anything else about the process kind of from start to finish that could have felt easier?

> P8: I am surprised I haven't noticed this. Is this already something that's live? The Ask VA feature?

Tyler: This is not on VA.gov right now, but it does exist. It's on a different website. So I can send you the link in the chat before we finish. If you want to check it out.

> P8: Okay, I yeah. I was surprised because I've never seen that before.

> P8: I think that it'll be a lot easier to use one this is more prominent on the websites that you can just ask a question online. That's something that I like. It's much more efficient than spending a couple of hours on the phone with the VA. Getting routed all of the different numbers.

> P8: I would prefer to be able to ask questions online then do it over the phone. But if it is slower...

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. I'm curious. Have you ever seen the contact page on va.gov?

> P8: Yes, I have seen the Contact page. And I recall lots of phone numbers. I usually go to my local VA website, my Va Medical center website instead of big Va, because, as I recall, it's a lot of the the national stuff. And you have to do a lot of dialing down to get to where you need.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. So it's easier for you to go to your local va and and maybe they're more responsive too.

Tyler: awesome. So we talked a little bit about the process. But you didn't really mention, while we were going through it, that it felt like long you did mention that you were surprised, that question, that there was any information after you put in your question. How how did the process feel in terms of how long it took, or how many questions there were.

> P8: It seems like there were many more steps than I would have anticipated, and the flow of information seemed clunky and out of place to me. It was not just long. It seemed like a lot of it was ordered differently than what I would have expected.

Tyler: Yeah, it was a little bit like out of order. And and yeah, that makes sense did you ever get a sense like that you knew how much longer you ha?

> P8: No, no, yeah.

> P8: I thought that I would be done after clicking [next] after [typing in] my question. That's something that would also be very useful to know.

> P8: I've seen some websites where they have a little bar. You are this percent close to getting to the question. That would be very useful, especially in the days when I'm pressed for time, and might not be able to finish an application all at once.

Tyler: Yeah, I can see how that would be really useful. And kind of on that note like, let's say it was the day where you were pressed for time. But you'd started doing it. Is there a way? Was there a way for you to save what you were doing and come back to it later. Did you ever get a sense for that?

> P8: I saw the draft saved and it was very specific with the date and time. My assumption would be that if I logged back into the VA.gov and went to the ask a question page, it would have it listed there. And that I would be able to continue.

> P8: That's what I would expect.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: I think you've answered all my questions.

Tyler: I'm, curious, if you have any other questions for me, I guess, about the product. I can send you a link to the current version of this and I'll send it in the chat so you can have a look when you feel like it.

> P8: Yeah, no, I don't have any questions. I do appreciate that this looks attractive as well. The messaging thing. It's aesthetically pleasing, but most importantly easy for me to read.

Tyler: Yeah, thank you.

Tyler: Yeah. Well, that's good. That's a win. Yeah.

Tyler: I can definitely see areas where like things didn't make sense where they were, or like a question just shouldn't have been in the form and then there was also moments when it felt very clear, and you could just go and click the thing. And you could say, I'm a Veteran. So I think I think that's really helpful feedback. So I really appreciate. You spending the time with us today.

Tyler: I loved having a look at your wall as we were chatting. Cause, that's quite fun and yeah, I think, that's all from me. So the the folks who send up this research session they're gonna send you a thank you note with some information that you can pass on to other veterans if they would like to to do this in the future as well. And if you have any questions for them. You can just reach out to them over email, but yeah, I hope you have a lovely rest of your day.

> P8: Thanks so much, Tyler, and thank you all for doing this. It's a really important mission. Veterans appreciate it.

Tyler: Awesome. Well, thanks so much. We appreciate your time.

Tyler: Yeah. Have a good take care.

> P8: Thanks, alright! Bye.

Tyler: Bye.
