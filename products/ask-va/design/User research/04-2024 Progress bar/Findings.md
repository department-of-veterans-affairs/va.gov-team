## Research goals

The key goals of this study are to:

* Compare whether it’s more effective to describe percentage complete or not describe progress at all
* Review whether submitters understand when to sign in or not
* Review whether submitters are clear on when to use Ask VA and how to start

## Research questions

Compare whether it’s more effective to describe percentage complete or not describe progress at all:
* Do submitters notice the progress indicator?
* Is this progress indicator effective in describing how far along you are and how much is left?
* Do submitters notice when there's no progress indicator?
* In both scenarios, are submitters missing information (sections, chapters, etc.) to orient them?

Review whether submitters understand when to sign in or not:
* Is it clear when you need to sign in and why?
* If submitters decide not to sign in, why?
* If submitters are interrupted to sign in, do they understand why and what to do?
* Is it clear why information is pre-filled in the form?

Review whether submitters are clear on when to use Ask VA and how to start:
* Can submitters successfully start a new question from the authenticated dashboard?
* Do submitters understand not to use Ask VA in an emergency?
* Do submitters understand what to do in an emergency (instead of using Ask VA)?
* Do submitters notice any overlap between Ask VA and other VA tools?

## Methodology 

This will be a moderated usability study conducted remotely over Zoom. We will use Figma prototypes with limited interactivity. We will present a scenario where the submitter has a question about their **education benefits**.

In half of the sessions, participants will use a prototype that includes a **new** progress indicator. In the other half, participants will use a prototype that **does not include** any progress indicator. We will compare both approaches.

We will let submitters **choose whether to sign in or not without guidance**. If they don't choose to sign in up front, they'll be prompted by a modal or alert to sign in after they choose their category and topic. In this scenario, they will need to sign in to continue. We will pre-fill certain parts of the form with mock data.

These are the main components and/or pages, we're testing:
- Progress bar
- Homepage (Unauthenticated)
- Dashboard without cards
- Sign in interruption

## Hypotheses and conclusions

|Hypothesis|Conclusion|Explanation|
|:--|:--|:--|
|Participants won't notice or point out the progress indicator without prompting.|Definitely False|Many participants noticed and pointed out the progress bar from the first page in the form, without prompting.|
|Participants won't notice or point out the lack of a progress indicator without prompting.|Likely False|2 of 3 participants who didn't see the progress indicator mentioned that something showing your progress would have helped.|
|Percentage will be enough information to motivate participants that they're making progress.|Likely True|At the beginning, percentage was daunting but later on, it was motivating. It helped people, at least, know they were progressing.|
|Participants will be able to start a new question from the authenticated dashboard without issue.|Definitely True|All participants were able to start a new question from the dashboard.|
|Participants will understand not to use Ask VA in emergencies.|Definitely True|Many participants noticed and appreciated content about emergencies. It's clear Ask VA is for non-urgent questions.|
|If participants don't understand that they need to sign in at first, it will be clear once they're prompted to sign in.|Definitely True|Even though some participants chose not to sign in at first, they could tell the VA may ask them to. They weren't surprised by the modal.|

## Key findings

1. It's not clear what you can ask about and how to start asking, until after you sign in.
2. People are motivated to sign in for a more personalized response, not necessarily because it's more secure.
3. Although the percentage is daunting at first, it's later motivating and helps you know when you're done.
4. School information fields are interpreted inconsistently without more details.
5. It's clear why information is pre-filled, but there's uncertainty about what's impacted if you edit pre-fill.
6. Most people notice their progress being saved and expect to find their unfinished question in their dashboard.

## Details of findings 

### Finding 1: It's not clear what you can ask about and how to start asking, until after you sign in.

_Labels: `AUD: Veterans`, `PRDT: AVA`_

People expect a quick way to ask a question, so they look for an input field right away.

They also look for information about what to use the tool for. So, content about emergencies is noticed and appreciated.

After sign in, they will click on the 'Ask a new question' link which is a clear call-to-action.

When they read the list of category options, they're more clear on what subjects you can ask about. Still, some people reach the end of the form surprised to not have an answer yet.

> "So first, I would definitely read through this to find out if this is where I should submit my question."

> "It says all questions about education benefits, work study and debt [...] Would this be a venue that I would be asking questions about disability as well?"

> "I do wonder whether it might be beneficial to [describe] the types of information that you might be able to get from this type of platform."

> "That is the most important thing [...] Because, it's gonna take a while to get an answer. And if you're in an emergency situation, you need help immediately."

### Finding 2: People are motivated to sign in for a more personalized response, not necessarily because it's more secure.

_Labels: `AUD: Veterans`, `PRDT: AVA`, `PRDT: Login`, `PRDT: VA.gov Profile`_

People are unlikely to read the details about why to sign in, and no one mentions security.

Instead, most people are motivated to sign in because they believe they'll get a more personalized response. Some mention pre-fill.

Those who choose not to sign in are aware VA recommends they do. They want to avoid the hurdle, or, are unclear that Ask VA isn't a list of FAQs or search function.

So, although it's not surprising being told to sign in later on,  it still feels like a "gotcha." Why'd you let me not sign in, in the first place?

> "[In] my experience, it's usually better if you have an account [...] you're going to get more specific response usually. And that way you have a place that you can go to, should you wanna see that same response again."

> "[It] notes personal questions about your benefits or someone else's benefits. And to me, that indicates that it's going to be a response more tailored to my experience."

> "I would probably come back to signing in or creating an account, if I didn't find my answer readily available."

> "I feel like it was a little bit of trickery going on [...] I knew I had to sign in, it was just a matter of time."

### Finding 3: Although the percentage is daunting at first, it's later motivating and helps you know when you're done.

_Labels: `AUD: Veterans`, `PRDT: AVA`, `DSC: Progress bars`_

Excluding a progress indicator ensures people won't be frustrated or distracted by it.

However, without it, people are unsure of when they're finished submitting their question. Particularly, if the number of questions feels surprising.

Those who were initially deterred by the progress indicator found it motivating as they progressed in the form. The orange seemed to help it stand out. And it became less noticeable as people went along.

And, although they didn't get a perfect idea of how long they had left, it showed them they were making progress.

> "My first reaction to this [is], 'Oh my god! I'm only 5% complete with this process.' [...] I have a long way to get an answer to this question."

> "[At the end] I would be congratulating myself on actually following through and clicking all of the buttons afterwards. Otherwise I likely wouldn't have submitted it, [but would have] thought that I submitted it."

> "It's kind of surprising in the beginning, but in hindsight I guess it's good to know how far along you are."

> "I think if there's no indication, I'm going to get frustrated, because it was already more screens than I was expecting to go through. [... I need to] know that I'm moving towards the end."

### Finding 4: School information fields are interpreted inconsistently without more details.

_Labels: `AUD: Veterans`, `PRDT: AVA`_

There's various ways to interpret whether you're a GI bill beneficiary. 'Yes' could mean you're receiving benefits, you're eligible, or, you think you may be eligible.

People think school state is required and residency state isn't.

School state is confusing if you're not already in school. And residency state is complex for many Veterans who think it needs to match their DD24.

Although people know files aren't required, they try to think of things that could be helpful, but may not be necessary.

> "I'm not sure how to answer this, because beneficiary, to me, means I'm taking advantage of it. [But] another meaning could be, I can potentially receive it."

> "I guess the school state is required and residency state is not necessarily. But I feel like I should give it, even if it's not required."

> "Sometimes they still want [your hometown state] from your DD214 to make sure it matches."

> "What am I supposed to upload? Why would I upload something? My natural thought says it would be my DD214."

### Finding 5: It's clear why information is pre-filled, but there's uncertainty about what's impacted if you edit pre-fill.

_Labels: `AUD: Veterans`, `PRDT: AVA`_

It's clear that personal information is pre-filled because you signed in.

People expect to edit pre-filled details by clicking into the field and making changes.

But, there's uncertainty about whether those changes will be reflected across VA.gov or just the form they're working on.

Many people continue to expect personal information to be come first after they sign in, before they get into the bulk of the form.

> "That's pretty helpful that I wouldn't have to go through and input all this stuff, especially since I had already logged in.

> "That's my assumption. That if I fix it here, it's gonna reflect [everywhere]."

> "I would honestly have no idea what to think [...] There's nothing indicating to me that if I update my information here, it will update anywhere else."

> "This would have been good after I signed in. So I signed in and VA says, okay, this is who we think you are. Are we right? [...] You're [Hector James], right? And you were born on [...] That's all accurate, and then go into the process of asking the question."

### Finding 6: Most people notice their progress being saved and expect to find their unfinished question in their dashboard.

_Labels: `AUD: Veterans`, `PRDT: AVA`_

People tend to notice their question being saved and find it reassuring.

However, the text, 'Finish this question later' is confusing if you interpret 'question' as the page, rather than the entire submission.

Most people expect to find their unfinished question under 'Your questions' when they sign in to their dashboard.

But some people expect a prompt or aren't sure how to get back to an unfinished question, if they leave the form.

> "So if you get disconnected and you'll sign back in [and] it will allow you to start where you stopped."

> "Finish this question later – does that mean that I could [click] that on all of them, and just get to the end and submit my question?"

> "I would hope that I would be able to go to that initial page sign in, and then I should be able to find questions in progress..."

> "I guess you would click that green box there, we saved your progress [...] I don't know if you can click on that part and it would bring you back [here]?"

## Additional insights

- Overall, the process was simple enough that people consistently get themselves through each question.
- People could find the category and topic in this scenario, despite mention of the number of options to choose from.
- 'I'm the Veteran' is a very clear choice, but it may not be the case if you're also in a business role.
- 'Reason you contacted us' is consistently redundant, confusing and unrelated.
- People want to review their question on the review page, not just their personal information.
- It's expected that the form start at 0% and end at 100% upon submission.
- The difference between My HealtheVet Secure Messaging and Ask VA is more clear after you finish.
- Being able to ask about all different subjects in one place, may be Ask VA's unique selling point.
- When people aren't sure what to expect from Ask VA, they hope for a way to ask their question in free-text and receive an immediate response. They describe tools similar to chatbots, or "interactive FAQ's."
- One person's experience was shaped by their feeling that VA websites  come off unfriendly and monotone.

## Recommendations

1. Make the call-to-action on the home page more clear and focus on type of response.
2. Include the progress bar and set general expectations for length of time to complete the form.
3. Ask submitters to review non-editable personal information up front when authenticated.
4. Let people make temporary, local updates to their contact information.
5. Revisit saved progress feature in future.
6. Review school information fields to assess need and add clarifying content.
7. Move 'Your question' to be the last page and make it easy to review before you submit.

## Details of recommendations 

### Recommendation 1: Make the call-to-action on the home page more clear and focus on type of response.

How Ask VA works and which topics it covers should be more clear from the homepage. Also, we should reframe the difference between general and personal questions.

This recommendation involves:
- explaining which topics Ask VA covers, instead of only naming those that always require sign in
- reframing the difference between a personal and general question, so it's about personalized or general information
- strongly encouraging people to use the chatbot, FAQ or elsewhere if they need general information
- making it more clear what Ask VA is and how it works, eg. "We will get information from you, review and send back a response."

### Recommendation 2: Include the progress bar and set general expectations for length of time to complete the form.

Percentage motivates people and offers clarity about whether they're finished yet. Still, it may not give the full picture on how much longer you have left.

This recommendation involves:
- setting expectations for how long it should take to fill out the form
- making it clear that the percentage complete is how much of the form you've completed
- adjusting the percentage so it starts at 0% on the category page and finishes at 100% (without showing the progress bar) on the confirmation page

### Recommendation 3: Ask submitters to review non-editable personal information up front when authenticated.

When people authenticate, it should be easy for them to review and submit information we already know and that they can't change, such as their legal name, DOB and SSN. People expect this to happen after they sign in, rather than in the middle of the form.

This recommendation involves:
- letting people review their personal information at the start of the form
- making it quick to review information that you can't edit
- making it clear when you can't edit information that you're reviewing

### Recommendation 4: Let people make temporary, local updates to their contact information.

If people update their pre-filled information in the form, it's unclear whether it will impact their profile information. We should make it clear which information they can edit, such as, their contact information. And how it doesn't impact their profile.

This recommendation involves:
- letting people edit their contact information in the form, without it impacting their profile
- making it clear how your profile will not change if you edit a field in the form
- adding a flag so the CRM team knows not to update their database when information has been 'manipulated'

### Recommendation 5: Revisit saved progress feature in future.

If people don't finish their question, they could have the option to come back and submit it later. We assessed the feasibility, effort and purpose of this feature. We also discussed how submitters are prompted to return to their unfinished question.

This feature will be put on hold right now, because it's not a current feature on ask.va.gov and is not in scope for Phase 1.

### Recommendation 6: Review school information fields to assess need and add clarifying content.

Some school information fields are not consistently clear. We need to review and refine these, so they make sense.

This recommendation involves:
- reviewing fields with GI Bill team
- checking our assumption that most people have a residency state and not everyone has a school state
- understanding why we ask for school or residency state and how to describe both more clearly
- understanding what GI Bill beneficiary means and how to describe it more clearly
- understanding current issues with and needs for file uploads and how to describe these clearly
- changing required label behavior

### Recommendation 7: Move 'Your question' to be the last page and make it easy to review before you submit.

We've consistently found that people expect 'Your question' to be the last question in the form. Or, it should be closely connected to category and topic. 

This recommendation involves:
- making 'Your question' the last page in the form, across the board
- removing 'Reason you contacted us' from the form
- defaulting all accordions 'open' on the review page

## Underserved groups we haven’t talked to 

We have completed the [VA Recruitment Checker for marginalized Veteran groups](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit#gid=1221033726).

We had 2 no shows. We recruited specifically for LGBTQ+ participants, since our last study didn't meet our targets. This study did not recruit for other than honorable, immigrant origin, expat or AT users.

In our next study we plan to prioritize Asian and Hispanic participants, as well as Veterans without degrees and with cognitive disabilities.
