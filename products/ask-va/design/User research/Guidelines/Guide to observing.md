## Before the session

* Read the research plan to remind yourself of the research objectives.
* Clear your space, find your headphones and mute distractions, like Slack notifications. Be prepared to have your camera on.
* Sign in to Zoom and change the display name to your first or preferred name (your name shouldn't be "Observer").
* Open (or join) `#feedback-backchannel` on DSVA Slack. Find the thread for your session.
* Open the Mural board (you can find a link in the meeting invitation or `#feedback-backchannel` thread). Find your session.

## At the start of the session

* Join the Zoom waiting room. Before you're admitted, the moderator will ask for the participant's consent to have you and other observers join the session.
    * If they say no, the moderator will message on `#feedback-backchannel` and you can leave the call.
    * If they say yes, the moderator will admit you to the meeting.
* Join the meeting with your **camera on** and **microphone off**.
* The moderator will verbally introduce you and the other observers. If there's time, the moderator will ask you to say hello. Otherwise you can keep your **microphone off**.
* After introductions, the moderator will ask you to turn your **camera off** and **microphone off** for the rest of the session.

## Throughout the session

* Instead of using Zoom chat, use the session ðŸ§µ in `#feedback-backchannel` to communicate with your team. You can write reflections, or even a question you'd like the researcher to try and add in.

### If something goes wrong

* The moderator's number one priority is to **keep the participant safe** or **avoid doing additional harm**.
* If a participant appears distressed, they will take a moment to check in with them, offer to move on and skip the question or topic, or they'll suggest taking a short break.
* If a participant continues to give signs of distress, the researcher will follow an emergency exit strategy that they have prepared for.
* If a participant experiences a medical or psychological emergency, then the researcher will follow [a protocol](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-safety-and-emergency-exit-strategies#Researchsafetyandemergencyexitstrategies-Requestingemergencyassistance) to request assistance.
* As a notetaker, it's also important to look after yourself during research. If you no longer feel safe or capable to continue taking notes, you should feel empowered to exit the call quietly. You can message the moderator (personally or in `#feedback-backchannel` and let them know you left). They will check in with you after the session finishes.

## At the end of the session

* Continue to keep your **camera off** and **microphone muted** even at the end of the session.

## After the session

* After each session, we will have an optional 10 minute debrief. Please leave and rejoin the same meeting link.
* Write your top 3 key takeaways in Mural.
* If you have further questions or comments for the moderator, reach out to them directly.
