## Background

Ask VA (AVA) is an online portal that allows Veterans, caregivers and others to submit questions to VA and receive a secure response. Currently, AVA resides within a stand-alone Microsoft portal that is inconsistent with VA design standards, is not mobile-friendly, and has accessibility issues. 

We need to move AVA to VA.gov. It should be mobile friendly, accessible and easy to submit an issue and receive updates and information that results in a final resolution. Ultimately, we want AVA to feel part of a cohesive and user-centered approach to support. This [product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/products/ask-va-phase-1-product-outline.md) includes more details about the scope of Phase 1 of our work.

### OCTO priorities

This research supports the following OCTO FY24 priority:

* Better experiences: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.

### Veteran journey

Ask VA can support Veterans, their family members, and other submitters at many stages of the Veteran journey. They may use Ask VA when they’re separating up until aging.

## Research goals

The key goal of this study is to:

* Identify any barriers that could prevent Veterans who use assistive technology from reviewing past questions, reading a reply from VA or replying to VA through Ask VA

### Outcome

This research will help us document and prioritize any bugs or usability issues before we launch on VA.gov.

### Research questions

* Are any headers, labels or links lacking description or clarity?
* Can Veterans interact with all elements using only their keyboards?
* Are click targets, hover states and labels of controls always available and clear?
* Are Veterans still oriented and able to use the dashboard when magnified?
* Are there any inconsistencies during the journey that present confusion?
* Do Veterans who use assistive technology feel they can read a reply from VA or reply to VA without the support of another person?
* Does Ask VA need to change or evolve to offer an equitable experience? If so, how?
* Are statuses clear, do they require more description? If so, just for screen reader users or for everyone?
* Do accordions adding unnecessary complexity? Would plain text be better for the conversation?

### Hypotheses

1. Veterans will think headers, labels and links are descriptive and clear.
2. Veterans will be able to interact with all elements using only their keyboards or other devices.
3. Veterans will be oriented and still able to use the dashboard when magnified.
4. Veteran's who use screen readers will find it difficult to know how many cards are under the "Your question" section, including when they filter by category and/or status.
5. Veterans will not have difficulty navigating between pages of cards on the dashboard with their assistive technology.
6. Veterans will find it difficult to understand what each status means without more description, regardless of which assistive technology they use.

## Methodology

We will run a moderated usability study remotely on Zoom. We will mock the sign in process, so participants don't have to sign in but we can test the authenticated experience.

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach

We will work with Perigean to recruit Veterans for this research.

We request that Perigean:
- shares a link or screenshot of the recruitment survey for this study, so we can review it before it goes out to participants
- if we're facing issues with no-shows or cancellations, we'll ask that you call remaining participant to remind them about the session, one day in advance.

### Recruitment criteria

We will recruit 12 Veterans for:
- **minimum** of 3 sessions with screen reader users
- **minimum** of 2 sessions with alternative navigation users
- **minimum** of 1 session with a screen magnification user
