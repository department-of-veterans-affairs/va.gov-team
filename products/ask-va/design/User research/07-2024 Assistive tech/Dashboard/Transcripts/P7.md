### Warm up

Tyler: All right. So the recording has started. And I just want to confirm that you're comfortable. If I record my screen and audio today.

> P7: My name is [P7], and I'm perfectly comfortable having this conversation recorded and used  for development to the Va programs, and you may use it in any way that's helpful to the Va.

Tyler: Awesome. I appreciate that. Do you have any questions for me? At this point.

> P7: No, no, I mean let's go.

Tyler: Awesome. Well, before we get started testing the website, I'd just love to learn a little bit more about your experience. As a veteran, and with the Va how long have you been a veteran?

> P7: I guess I became a veteran the day I entered the Air Force, so, [1960's], I retired in [1980's]. So I became associated with the Veterans Administration in [1980's]. And very long story, I'm now consider 100% disabled.

10
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:06.220
Tyler: Okay.

11
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:16.580
Tyler: great. So you've got experience with the Va for quite a few years now. And how are you interacting with the Va these days. Do you receive healthcare through the Va.

12
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.750
> P7: I use the Va A lot, but in particular

13
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:36.399
> P7: the Audiology department with the hearing aids and the ophthalmology department with eyeglasses, and so on. Mental health.

14
00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.370
> P7: and I see my Va. General practitioner once a year, and she coordinates

15
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.169
> P7: lots of medicines and other things for me.

16
00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.439
> P7: because I'm completely retired. I have

17
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.140
> P7: tricare.

18
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.440
> P7: and I see a lot of civilian doctors. And so.

19
00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:05.559
> P7: for example, my medical blood tests are done in the civilian hospital, and then I send them to the Va. To go into the records system. There.

20
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:13.239
> P7: But I have the advantage of having 2 medical systems looking after me, so I have sort of the best of both worlds.

21
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.150
Tyler: Yeah, that's good, that that sounds comprehensive, which is really good to hear.

22
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.040
Tyler: when you're interacting with your Va doctors, how do you usually get in touch with them.

23
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.130
> P7: By banging my head on the wall.

24
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.820
Tyler: Yes.

25
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.900
> P7: Okay.

26
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.860
> P7: there is a new system out, called the Portal.

27
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.389
> P7: Don't know the right name, but I need to make sure that you guys know what I'm talking about.

28
00:02:39.265 --> 00:02:45.950
> P7: Captain James, the Lowell Medical Center in North Chicago, Illinois, is using the new system.

29
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.789
> P7: and one of the methods is secure messaging.

30
00:02:51.070 --> 00:03:01.599
> P7: So blah blah blah blah I've logged in. I click send a message. I pick my doctor's name and say, dear doctor, I need to talk to you or, dear doctor, would you please do that?

31
00:03:02.435 --> 00:03:03.080
Tyler: Okay.

32
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.090
> P7: Damn thing! Don't work!

33
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:06.130
Tyler: Okay.

34
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.620
> P7: Me repeat that damn thing. Don't work.

35
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.070
Tyler: Yeah, tell me more about that. Why are you? Why are you finding it doesn't work.

36
00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:23.580
> P7: All my doctors have very long foreign names, and I have trouble with names. So Doctor A is a

37
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.329
> P7: Md. Psychologist.

38
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.870
> P7: and because I get psychiatrists and psychologists mixed up. He's the one that can write a prescription.

39
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:41.499
> P7: I am supposed to send secure messages to him. I cannot, because his name is not on the list.

40
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.120
Tyler: Oh, okay.

41
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:53.380
> P7: I have been told stories like well, you didn't. You haven't seen him yet. I've been told stories like he's an intern or a resident and blah blah blah blah!

42
00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.129
> P7: None of that is correct. He is a long-term

43
00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:06.239
> P7: person. His fifties, who's fully qualified, have been with Va for a million years, and there's no reason why it doesn't work.

44
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.920
> P7: Is another doctor

45
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:14.859
> P7: in the same office with him, who is a co-worker, and I'll call her Dr. L.

46
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.560
> P7: I can send messages to Dr. L.

47
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.860
> P7: And

48
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.910
> P7: she can't open them.

49
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:35.930
> P7: I can send them, but they sit in the waiting to be opened forever, because she is not my doctor, and is not linked to me, and whatever security systems are in there say that she can't open them.

50
00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.290
> P7: and so she asked me to stop sending her messages because they just sit in her

51
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:42.870
> P7: inbox.

52
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.380
Tyler: Right? Okay.

53
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.909
> P7: When I talked to everybody about it. Everybody gave me long boring

54
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.859
> P7: excuses. You have to do this. They have to do that. Blah blah blah!

55
00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.200
> P7: As near as I can figure out.

56
00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:02.309
> P7: the company that wrote the software and the company that installed it at the hospital

57
00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.780
> P7: are blaming each other, and they won't do anything until the lawsuit is settled.

58
00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.569
Tyler: Oh, gosh, okay, so it sounds.

59
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:11.740
> P7: Stupid world.

60
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.429
> P7: 2,024.

61
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:31.580
Tyler: Okay, so that sounds pretty frustrating. One is, you can't actually message one of your doctors. Because they're not in the system. And the other one. Your other doctor can't open the messages. So that's really frustrating. Do you call your doctors instead? Or what do you end up doing.

62
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.800
> P7: When I really need to talk to him.

63
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:41.590
> P7: I call the hospital, get a hold of their receptionist in the Mental Health Department.

64
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:56.579
> P7: explain the situation and ask him to call back. And usually a nurse or a senior technician calls me back and is able to take care of what I do. I've never actually talked to him on the phone.

65
00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.920
Tyler: Okay.

66
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.089
> P7: That's not to imply that they didn't get my situation taken care of.

67
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.300
> P7: Luckily nothing.

68
00:06:05.776 --> 00:06:09.700
> P7: It wasn't none, none of it was 9 1 1, i mean.

69
00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.129
> P7: Annoying. Yes, no one's dying. That's good news.

70
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:24.607
Tyler: That's true. Yeah, but still that makes that does make it a little bit more difficult for you. If maybe what you'd prefer is to just get it done online.

71
00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:33.010
Tyler: so I'm curious. If you've ever heard of something called ask Va. It's so it's a bit different to secure messaging, which is what we're talking about.

72
00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.570
> P7: I've used Ask VA a couple of times.

73
00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.890
> P7: I'm glad it's there. It's not practical for me.

74
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:49.529
> P7: I can't remember any of the details of what it was, but I ended up being told to go see a

75
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:52.960
> P7: real person in in live situation.

76
00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:56.490
> P7: and got everything taken care of, and then

77
00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:00.489
> P7: a week or a month later they called to find out if I was okay.

78
00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:02.100
> P7: which I thought was

79
00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:08.460
> P7: a waste of time, because if it's a month later. Then either I'm dead or it's taken care of. But.

80
00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:10.640
> P7: Why are you calling now? But anyway.

81
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:18.269
Tyler: Right? Yeah, okay. And do you? I know you said it might be difficult to remember. Do you remember if it was about healthcare when you used ask Va.

82
00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:25.430
> P7: Yes, I'm I'm making this up. This is not a real medical situation.

83
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:39.639
> P7: Yesterday my left arm really hurt, and I couldn't figure out what was wrong, and I realized that it's been hurting for the last 2 weeks, and I went to ask Va and blah blah blah blah, they said, go to an urgent Care Office.

84
00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:41.460
Tyler: Gotcha. Okay?

85
00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:55.250
Tyler: Yeah. So that I can see how that's frustrating. And and and knowing a little bit about how Asva works, I'm not that surprised that that happened, even though that maybe shouldn't happen So

86
00:07:55.764 --> 00:08:06.390
Tyler: I'm curious. Why you decided to use. Ask Va for that situation. What kind of made you think maybe this is a good thing to use. Ask Va. For.

87
00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:14.860
> P7: I do not filter my incoming emails. So I get approximately a hundred 50 emails a day.

88
00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:24.110
> P7: And many of them are things from the Va that say, Hi, we're here to help. Did you know about this program, or did you know about that program.

89
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:26.420
> P7: And it said.

90
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:30.129
> P7: told me something about Sva. And I said, Oh.

91
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:35.309
> P7: Well, since I'm trying to figure out what to do with my shoulder, I think I'll just ask them.

92
00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:37.959
> P7: With a text messaging

93
00:08:38.369 --> 00:08:39.829
> P7: situation.

94
00:08:40.229 --> 00:08:43.339
> P7: and I already described it so, you know. But.

95
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:50.609
> P7: That's why I called ask Va. Because they advertised it, and it sounded interesting, and I thought I'd try it.

96
00:08:50.910 --> 00:09:00.996
Tyler: That makes sense, and I can see how that's frustrating. If the Va. Is telling you, here's this tool you can use, and then you use it, and you're like that wasn't helpful.

97
00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:08.139
> P7: I want. I want to defend them, because.

98
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:13.489
> P7: The Va. Has 10 million tools, and I only need 27 of them.

99
00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:15.230
> P7: So right?

100
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:21.699
> P7: Just because they tell me about a tool, and I try and use it, and it's not helpful to me. I don't think they did a bad job.

101
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:32.729
> P7: I don't know the career field of advertising, and I don't know the career field of medicine, but trying to reach out to all of us.

102
00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:42.962
> P7: There's people like me that really think highly of the Va. And there's others that would like to burn the whole place down you're dealing with a wide range. And so I'm

103
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:49.909
> P7: I'm not annoyed or frustrated that it didn't work out for me. It's just that. Yes, I used it, and it didn't work out.

104
00:09:50.980 --> 00:10:03.040
Tyler: yeah, and that's such a good point that there are a lot of different tools. So maybe in your from your perspective, it's about finding the right tool for you. And and I can totally understand that.

105
00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:14.659
Tyler: I do want to transition to talk a little bit more about how you've been using assistive technology? So we talked about how you use dragon? How long have you been using dragon.

106
00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:17.489
> P7: Least 5 years.

107
00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:17.820
Tyler: Camera.

108
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:19.860
> P7: Quite sure, but somewhere around, then.

109
00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:22.580
Tyler: Okay. And how often do you use it?

110
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:23.790
> P7: Daily.

111
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:28.799
Tyler: do you use? Do you ever use the computer and not use dragon.

112
00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.120
> P7: Well, my life I mean.

113
00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:31.820
Tyler: Right.

114
00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:38.009
> P7: It only came into existence a few years ago. I okay, I have dyslexia.

115
00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:41.760
> P7: And so I'm lucky if I can spell

116
00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:45.560
> P7: any word over 5 letters twice in a row.

117
00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:52.009
> P7: And so right now, if we were in a chat session.

118
00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:53.790
> P7: I would

119
00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:59.649
> P7: switch to windows, open up, Microsoft word.

120
00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.610
> P7: Open up, dragon, and I would dictate.

121
00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:12.129
> P7: I'm really wondering what to do next. Please give me some directions. I'd run that through the spell checker that I'd cup and paste it into my

122
00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:14.919
> P7: chat

123
00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:20.610
> P7: session with you, and then hit enter, and then you would come back and tell me what to do.

124
00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:25.379
> P7: and then I would decide whether to type. Oh, okay, which I can spell.

125
00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:27.339
> P7: Or go back to

126
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:31.739
> P7: windows word dragon, and dictate another message.

127
00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:41.050
> P7: So lots of times I can type things. For example, if you ask me my address right now. I can do my address 6, 10, Robert York Avenue.

128
00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:43.609
> P7: and I can just type that on the keyboard.

129
00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:53.689
> P7: But, on the other hand, other hand, one of the words I have trouble with is, wait. I can never remember how to spell. Wait, so I would go to word and

130
00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.732
> P7: tell the machine.

131
00:11:56.310 --> 00:12:00.059
> P7: Wait a minute, and then it would produce the word wait, and I could

132
00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.990
> P7: cut that word out and send it to you.

133
00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:04.609
Tyler: Gotcha.

134
00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:13.429
Tyler: that that's really helpful. Just to better understand like some of that detail of how you're using it, do you use it sounds obviously helpful for you.

135
00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:24.920
Tyler: for dictation and and spelling and and writing things. Do you also use dragon to navigate so to click through a website, or when you're filling out a form.

136
00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:30.990
> P7: I do not use dragon for navigation. I know that that can be done.

137
00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.234
> P7: And I don't use those features.

138
00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:37.180
> P7: filling out a form.

139
00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:40.542
> P7: I use the keyboard

140
00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.310
> P7: tab button to move from square to square.

141
00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:47.300
> P7: Okay? And then, once I'm in a square.

142
00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:50.679
> P7: I decide what to enter. So I go back and forth.

143
00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:56.140
> P7: get to the right square, go to Dragon, say

144
00:12:56.270 --> 00:13:02.519
> P7: June 20, th Vietnam, and then come back. Put it in, go to the next square

145
00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:09.989
> P7: and type in my social security number, because I don't need dragon for that, and then go to the next square, and so on, and so forth.

146
00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:26.267
Tyler: Gotcha. Okay, that's really helpful. So you're using your keyboard to navigate by like tabbing through the right box. In the form that's super helpful. And you we also talked about your device you're using. You're on a Mac right now.

147
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:32.270
Tyler: And you use a couple of different browsers. What browser do you think you want to use today?

148
00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:33.620
> P7: Alright.

149
00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:41.170
> P7: my browser choice is safari SAFA. RI.

150
00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:42.290
Tyler: Okay. Cool.

151
00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:43.420
> P7: Google

152
00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:44.950
> P7: Chrome

153
00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:47.070
> P7: is the other one.

154
00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:48.470
> P7: and

155
00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:57.070
> P7: the Va. And va.gov. Both say they don't support safari.

156
00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:08.660
> P7: And I have to use Google Chrome, and that is the only reason it's loaded on my machine. The only thing I use Google Chrome for is to go to the Va. And and the

157
00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:10.690
> P7: patient portal.

158
00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:19.220
> P7: because then I'm assured that it will work right. I should correct myself because Air Force pay whatever that is also

159
00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:21.770
> P7: pushes me to use chrome.

160
00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:22.840
Tyler: Okay?

161
00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:29.670
Tyler: So your preference is safari. But you, you use chrome for these scenarios where you kind of have to. Yeah.

162
00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:30.250
> P7: Good!

163
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:32.569
> P7: I'm sorry. His story of

164
00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:36.349
> P7: I have my opinion, and I lost the war, and I do it their way.

165
00:14:38.157 --> 00:14:58.859
Tyler: yeah, that's fair. Okay? Well, today you are welcome to to try using safari, although we're going to be on a Va website. But I think it might work. You, it's up to you. Before we do that, we're gonna have you share your screen on zoom so I just want to check. Have you shared your screen on zoom before.

166
00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:00.789
> P7: I have. Yes.

167
00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:10.240
Tyler: Okay, so let's go ahead and do that. There'll be a share screen button at the bottom of your zoom window. And it's towards the middle.

168
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:11.830
Tyler: so it should be.

169
00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:14.269
> P7: Green click on it. There we go!

170
00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:21.719
Tyler: Perfect. Yeah. So now it'll open up another window, and you can just choose to share your your whole screen.

171
00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:32.020
Tyler: Perfect. So it's loading for me. Okay, awesome. So now I can see something that says Zoom. So I should be seeing exactly what you're seeing.

172
00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:37.795
> P7: Can you? Whoops just a minute.

173
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:50.560
> P7: Don't need that.

174
00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:54.259
> P7: Can you see my screen now?

175
00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.280
Tyler: Yes, yeah, that's perfect.

176
00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:02.420
Tyler: So now that we're here, what we can do is open up your browser. So do you want to open up safari.

177
00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:05.540
> P7: Safari.

178
00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:07.000
> P7: Okay?

179
00:16:07.917 --> 00:16:20.060
Tyler: And actually sorry, [P7], I just realized another way of doing this might be that might be easier. If you navigate back to zoom. So the zoom application on that lower

180
00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:23.770
Tyler: part of your screen over towards the right

181
00:16:24.597 --> 00:16:27.240
Tyler: and we'll just come back to find

182
00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:32.819
Tyler: you. You were close there. If we go all the way to the lower right.

183
00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:34.190
> P7: The settings.

184
00:16:34.479 --> 00:16:43.749
Tyler: A little bit below that, so we'll go to that toolbar where we can see different boxes perfect, and then over to the left, where it says, zoom! One more awesome.

185
00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:47.219
Tyler: and let's see if that opens.

186
00:16:47.868 --> 00:16:51.811
Tyler: The zoom window where you can see my face.

187
00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:54.820
> P7: Your face on the right side of my gotcha.

188
00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:55.140
Tyler: Yeah.

189
00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:56.200
> P7: List of people.

190
00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:08.799
Tyler: Okay, cool. So you've got another screen that I can't see. Okay, perfect. So when you're on that zoom window, where you can see my face. If you just navigate to something that says chat on the zoom window. Do you see that.

191
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.760
> P7: Say the word again, chat.

192
00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:11.510
Tyler: Chat.

193
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:12.230
> P7: Chat.

194
00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:16.559
> P7: That what you wanted.

195
00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:21.230
Tyler: Yep, perfect. Yeah, chat. So in the chat I just sent you a link. Do you see that link? Now.

196
00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:22.839
> P7: This.

197
00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:24.910
> P7: That's right.

198
00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:27.689
> P7: Oh, there, okay.

199
00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:33.949
Tyler: Okay, perfect, awesome. So now I'm seeing your screen, and it looks like it says, Ask Va.

200
00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:40.610
> P7: Alright your chat window is still above that. How do I get rid of it?

201
00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:47.209
Tyler: Okay, so the chat window there might be an an X in the upper right corner. Do you see something that says an X,

202
00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:51.079
Tyler: and that might let you close the chat window.

203
00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:57.730
Tyler: We're not seeing an X.

204
00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:01.559
> P7: No, it's my.

205
00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:17.520
Tyler: Another thing we could try, [P7], is if you go and click on safari. So we go to that bottom toolbar. We were on earlier all the way to the left side. Yeah, let's try and click on safari and just see if did that jump in front of the tool, the the chat now.

206
00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:18.370
> P7: Nope.

207
00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:19.470
Tyler: No, okay.

208
00:18:20.082 --> 00:18:23.629
Tyler: What about dragging the chat? Is that something we could try?

209
00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:29.530
Tyler: Could we try and drag like click on the chat and then just move it over to to the left.

210
00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:31.089
Tyler: That does that work.

211
00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:33.539
> P7: Okay. I found a way to get out there. The.

212
00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:33.960
Tyler: Okay.

213
00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.420
> P7: Windows. Gone. Now. Okay.

214
00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:40.020
Tyler: Awesome. Okay, cool. So now you're on a website that says, Ask Va, right?

215
00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:40.890
> P7: Okay.

216
00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:49.030
Tyler: Okay, cool. So we're just gonna scroll down a little bit and we are gonna find that that blue bar that says research study.

217
00:18:49.965 --> 00:18:50.890
Tyler: And

218
00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:52.180
Tyler: I

219
00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:54.080
Tyler: just sort of

220
00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:59.950
Tyler: yeah. So if we scroll up a little bit, I'll try and help us find it. And there's 2 blue buttons.

221
00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:01.080
> P7: Right, yeah.

222
00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:03.869
Tyler: Perfect. And so let's click on that blue button.

### Dashboard

Tyler: Okay, awesome. So here we are. We're just going to stay here for a minute now, and so we're all ready to to kind of start testing this website. And I'm going to give you a little bit of context before we start. Okay.

224
00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:16.995
Tyler: so

225
00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:23.850
Tyler: this is a tool called, ask Va, it sounds like you have a bit of familiarity with it.

226
00:19:24.281 --> 00:19:47.780
Tyler: But just to remind everybody on the call. Ask, Va is a way for veterans to contact the Va and ask the question, sorry and ask a question online. In today's session. We're gonna pretend like you just signed in. So now you're in your account. You're on Va. Gov, you're all signed in. And you've done this because you want to read a reply that the Va has sent you

227
00:19:48.323 --> 00:20:05.897
Tyler: and so we're gonna go through a couple of different tasks today. And I'm gonna explain them as we go and as you navigate I'd really like to understand what's going through your mind. How you're navigating. So if you're using your keyboard. Maybe you can let me know. Okay, I'm using my keyboard now.

228
00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:12.099
Tyler: if you're using your mouse that that'll probably be quite obvious to me. And

229
00:20:12.522 --> 00:20:16.387
Tyler: while you're focused on a task, I'm gonna try and stay quiet.

230
00:20:17.269 --> 00:20:26.360
Tyler: but once you've finished or when you're ready to chat. Just let's pause, and we'll talk for a couple of minutes about what you just did. How does how does that all sound.

231
00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:30.910
> P7: That's all fine. I don't know where we're going, but I'm ready to go there.

232
00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:48.289
Tyler: Okay, perfect. And I just want to confirm. We talked about this earlier and it sounds like you would use dragon when you're ready to dictate because you need to type something and so right now it makes sense. But I just want to confirm you wouldn't use dragon at this moment right?

233
00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:48.750
> P7: And have like.

234
00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:49.310
Tyler: Turned on.

235
00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:51.580
> P7: Not using dragon, and they don't need it.

236
00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:52.870
Tyler: Okay, gotcha.

237
00:20:52.880 --> 00:21:22.180
Tyler: alright cool. So let's start with the the 1st task. So we're just gonna say you've arrived at. Ask Va. And the 1st thing I'd like you to do is orient yourself on this page. So I'm gonna give you a couple of minutes, and I just want you to navigate around and after you finish I'd like you to explain the page to me. The one thing I'll say is, if you want to click on something like if you if you find a link or a button that you want to click on, let me know before you click on it. Okay.

238
00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:22.760
> P7: Okay.

239
00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:43.150
> P7: I'm on a web screen called, Ask Va, and I'm trying to understand it. And it says your questions. And that seems interesting. And there seems to be all kinds of filters and stuff. So in progress back on the 17, th I asked them, and apparently that's in

240
00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:46.290
> P7: in progress. They're doing something about it.

241
00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:51.080
> P7: the reopen submitted on August 26.th

242
00:21:51.759 --> 00:21:56.160
> P7: How to get my Va. My wife's Va. Card?

243
00:21:57.590 --> 00:22:14.965
> P7: I I think that's what I want to do so. I'm going to click on details. Not really. I'm I'm going down and seeing ones that said reply, Oh, yeah, I remember I already did all that, and I don't care anymore. And

244
00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:21.470
> P7: back in last year that was all sorted out

245
00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:26.500
> P7: going. Oh, I have a second page. I'm going to click on the number 2. I'm really going to do that.

246
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:29.120
> P7: And

247
00:22:30.496 --> 00:22:36.890
> P7: oh, there's 1 more. Oh, yeah, I remember that one. I don't care anymore. I'm going back to page one. I'm really going to click on that.

248
00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:43.290
> P7: And now I come down all the way to the bottom need help. Oh, there's the oh, that's the 1,000 number.

249
00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:52.960
> P7: The 1,000 number is great. They're very good people, but they're useless because they're not allowed to do a lot of things.

250
00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:56.070
> P7: complete size subject.

251
00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:10.319
> P7: I have a disagreement with a group that keep telling me what to do, and I want to contact them and talk to them. The 1,000 people are the interface, and I'm not allowed to talk to this particular group

252
00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:15.270
> P7: of Va technicians and the 1,000 group. People

253
00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:22.840
> P7: write a message for me, saying, dear, dumb people, why won't you help this guy? And then they never reply.

254
00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:28.839
> P7: And so the the 1,000 people are very nice, but they can't really always do much.

255
00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:29.670
Tyler: Yeah.

256
00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:30.859
Tyler: so, okay.

257
00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:33.530
> P7: I'm done looking at this page. What do you want me to do.

258
00:23:34.191 --> 00:23:52.050
Tyler: That was really helpful. I I really appreciate you speaking aloud as you as you went around the page, because that's helpful for me to know what you're thinking about? So when you 1st got to this page, you were like your questions, that's interesting. What? What made that interesting for you?

259
00:23:53.810 --> 00:24:00.690
> P7: Ask Va. I went here because I had something, or at least I thought I had something

260
00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:03.729
> P7: that maybe the Va. Could help me with.

261
00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:06.340
> P7: and so oh.

262
00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:09.910
> P7: they keep a record of all my old questions, apparently.

263
00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:22.730
> P7: And this one that submitted on August 24.th I'm very interested in that, and I still haven't got my spouse's Va. Card. So I think I really want to do something about that.

264
00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:25.710
> P7: And here it is, right in front of me, easy to open.

265
00:24:26.067 --> 00:24:43.600
Tyler: Okay, awesome. That makes sense. So you're like, you're noticing that there's some sort of record of your questions, which is nice and and makes you almost a bit curious. About using askpa. That that makes sense. Is there anything you found confusing about this page so far.

266
00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:44.080
> P7: Okay.

267
00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:57.559
> P7: displaying information on a computer screen is always an interesting combination of getting as much information you can and organizing it.

268
00:24:57.590 --> 00:25:02.910
> P7: So lots of times. You'll see a list, for example, when you get emails. It just tells you

269
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:06.009
> P7: the emails and maybe 2 or 3 lines.

270
00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:13.559
> P7: And you can't really tell whether you want to open an email or not. Sometimes this has taken a different approach, saying.

271
00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:19.180
> P7: we're going to eat. Treat each one separately and put a little square that's large enough to give

272
00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:21.320
> P7: quite a bit of information.

273
00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:33.900
> P7: The dates, so that I know what's going on, and the category which I don't really care about my personally. And then a summary, with a clear.

274
00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:40.760
> P7: large font. Click here. Yes, Dummy, this place is where you're supposed to click

275
00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:44.269
> P7: icon to go to the next step.

276
00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:48.350
> P7: and I personally like this layout.

277
00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:50.959
> P7: I'm not sure what the rest of the world

278
00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:52.430
> P7: thinks. But

279
00:25:52.773 --> 00:25:59.330
> P7: there's 2 groups of people in the world, those that agree with me and the rest of you guys. So I like this layout.

280
00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:05.909
Tyler: Okay, what do you? What do you like about this layout? You described it to me. But what do you like about that?

281
00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:16.290
> P7: It's simple, straightforward. It doesn't try to be clever. It's not wasting. Bandwidth. Got with lots of Logos and signs.

282
00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:19.860
> P7: The fonts are large enough that I can read them.

283
00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:20.540
Tyler: Okay.

284
00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:21.859
> P7: And again

285
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:25.960
> P7: click for details is very

286
00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:28.220
> P7: obvious to me.

287
00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:30.600
> P7: And

288
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:38.740
> P7: it! It's a it's a different color. It's a different font. It's underlined.

289
00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:42.410
> P7: It stands out so I can find it.

290
00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:43.400
Tyler: Okay.

291
00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:46.530
> P7: I have lots of emails that come in.

292
00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:54.009
> P7: and it will have a sentence like, if you want information. Click here. And the word here is the the hyperlink.

293
00:26:54.220 --> 00:27:02.770
> P7: and it's in the middle of a sentence, and it's not highlighted enough, and you've got to go find the word here. I know, to book for the word here, but this is much.

294
00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:06.900
> P7: Why make me work? You know.

295
00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:12.679
> P7: This is obviously what they want me to do, so why not make it easy for me to do it?

296
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:27.529
Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, I have a couple more questions about things you you mentioned. So one thing you mentioned was that the category. Is not that helpful for you, or you don't really care about the Ca category, which is totally fine? Why do you think that is.

297
00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:32.800
> P7: I think my mind works different from the rest of the world.

298
00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:40.410
> P7: Categories usually are something that comes from a pop-down menu.

299
00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:42.910
> P7: And so

300
00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:44.610
> P7: I want

301
00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:51.619
> P7: this. This is just an example. But I send lots of messages, doctors, and I have a choice of categories.

302
00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:54.470
> P7: I want a refill.

303
00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:57.810
> P7: I want to make an appointment.

304
00:27:58.370 --> 00:28:02.819
> P7: I have an emergency. I have a non urgent question.

305
00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:09.750
> P7: Everything falls into non-urgent questions, because if it was an emergency, I'd be dialing 911.

306
00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:10.860
Tyler: Right.

307
00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:18.119
> P7: It's not really a refill. I need them to change the prescription or something, because if I click on refill, it just takes me to another.

308
00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:23.869
> P7: computer driven menu where I never get to leave my message.

309
00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:27.420
> P7: Everything is non-urgent question.

310
00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:29.060
> P7: and

311
00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:42.029
> P7: it happens on this particular one that after you get to the non urgent question, it asks you for a sub second subcategory, which is very similar to the first.st So it's a non urgent question about non urgent questions.

312
00:28:42.342 --> 00:28:46.720
Tyler: Okay, that makes that makes a lot of sense. That's a great point that

313
00:28:47.161 --> 00:29:05.858
Tyler: folks should really only be using secure messaging when it's non urgent. And so that that's a really good point. And so your experience with categories obviously has come from using secure messaging and so you're kind of thinking of that in your head. And you're seeing these categories and feeling like they're not really that useful for me.

314
00:29:06.482 --> 00:29:22.949
Tyler: That that makes a lot of sense to me. At 1 point in the form you went to the second page, and you noticed that you had another question, did you have any difficulty getting to the second page, understanding what that Number 2 meant, or anything like that?

315
00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:23.520
> P7: No

316
00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:24.760
Tyler: Okay.

317
00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:30.070
> P7: I? I do have a question. If I had 20 pages, how would you display that.

318
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:38.560
> P7: Because some of them would just display the 1st 2, and you wouldn't know that there's a 3rd until you clicked over there.

319
00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:41.730
> P7: Some of them allow you to

320
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:46.300
> P7: say, display a certain number of messages per page.

321
00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:59.509
> P7: and I like that because I display a hundred messages per page, and scroll down as opposed to having you. You seem to choose just 4 pages or 4 messages per page.

322
00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:05.519
> P7: And then go to the next and 6, 1 of the half dozen the other but

323
00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:07.970
> P7: this

324
00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:10.680
> P7: is not standardized

325
00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:14.159
> P7: in the computer world, and I think it should be

326
00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:19.799
> P7: There might be a little space here or here that says

327
00:30:20.346 --> 00:30:23.889
> P7: of 2,000 or of 27,

328
00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:26.030
> P7: telling you how many pages there are.

329
00:30:26.348 --> 00:30:40.050
Tyler: Okay, gotcha. And I just wanna make sure, I'm understanding you correctly, so your your preference is that there's only a couple of things displayed, and then you go to a new page versus everything being on one long page. Is that right?

330
00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:47.190
> P7: Right. My preference is more on one page and a message saying, Scroll down. And there's another thing here.

331
00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:58.859
> P7: I want to make sure that you're seeing the same thing. The very bottom line on my computer screen says Category sign in and technical Issues Category sign in technical issues.

332
00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:00.799
Tyler: Yes. Yeah. Same for me.

333
00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:03.910
> P7: That's obvious that I need to scroll down.

334
00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:06.599
> P7: But if it happened to be

335
00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:08.430
> P7: like this.

336
00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:17.360
> P7: I wouldn't realize that I could scroll down. And my computer screen doesn't have a little sidebar that says Scroll down

337
00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:19.679
> P7: so I might not realize.

338
00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:21.599
> P7: I need to scroll down.

339
00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:22.980
Tyler: Yeah.

340
00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:25.429
> P7: Over here

341
00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:26.970
> P7: or over here.

342
00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:28.219
> P7: you might

343
00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:29.580
> P7: have

344
00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:32.930
> P7: something. I don't know how to phrase it.

345
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:35.810
> P7: Hey, Dummy, don't forget that you can scroll down.

346
00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:45.170
Tyler: Yeah, that's a good point. It's not always obvious, especially depending on where you land on the page. So you made a good point that

347
00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:54.930
Tyler: when when the text is cut off, you can tell, you need to scroll down but when it's when it's at a different part of the page. It's not as obvious. So, [P7].

348
00:31:55.010 --> 00:32:09.860
Tyler: the next thing that I'd like us to do is obviously there's a couple of questions in your account. So we're pretending like you've asked the Va. These questions, and I'd like for you to find a question that has a reply from the Va. So once you find that. Just let me know.

349
00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:15.690
> P7: reply, okay, here's a reply.

350
00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:18.760
> P7: You want to click on it.

351
00:32:19.203 --> 00:32:24.279
Tyler: Let's stay on this page for right now. But that's helpful. Is there any other question that has a reply?

352
00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:30.920
> P7: Well, there's 2 of them here that say reply, and I don't remember what was on the 3rd page. I I mean the second page.

353
00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:31.840
Tyler: Okay.

354
00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:33.920
Tyler: Perfect.

355
00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:44.469
Tyler: Okay, so that was pretty quick for you to find those questions. And I'm making an assumption. But it might be obvious you found that? Because it says replied at the top right.

356
00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:45.090
> P7: Yes.

357
00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:51.090
Tyler: Okay. And you're just like looking visually scanning the page and reading, replied.

358
00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:54.839
> P7: You know, just because we're talking.

359
00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:57.269
> P7: Does reply mean that they

360
00:32:57.570 --> 00:33:05.889
> P7: gave an initial answer, or they gave me an initial answer, and I was satisfied in the cases closed.

361
00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:10.240
Tyler: Well, that's a good question. What do you think? What would you hope that it means.

362
00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:18.504
> P7: Well, I'm gonna assume that reply means it could be either one. And so when I look into reply,

363
00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:25.239
> P7: one, okay, let's choose the one. How can I view my dependents information?

364
00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:38.960
> P7: And when I click on reply, they're going to say, you go to this web page and you click this, but don't forget you have to have it set up so that your dependents are linked to you, and you have a right to look at them.

365
00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:47.419
> P7: or it might say, we have gotten that fixed, and you can now go ahead and the case is closed. I don't know what it's gonna say.

366
00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:48.739
Tyler: Okay.

367
00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:57.184
Tyler: that makes sense. So you're assuming it could mean either one, either they sent you a reply and you go do this thing, or

368
00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:01.530
Tyler: or there's like something has been closed.

369
00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:03.230
Tyler: Okay.

370
00:34:03.842 --> 00:34:07.010
Tyler: that makes sense. And I can see how

371
00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:12.470
Tyler: maybe the one word is left to a little bit of interpretation. Right?

372
00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.590
> P7: If you have.

373
00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:25.459
> P7: and and I'm on my screen right now. It says in progress. Reopened reply, replied, replied.

374
00:34:25.659 --> 00:34:26.500
> P7: Okay.

375
00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:38.830
> P7: if you have 10,000 different words that could show up there, you might be very able to specifically tell me what's going on. But if these are just category words.

376
00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:42.259
> P7: then you're never going to be able to

377
00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:45.060
> P7: cover every situation.

378
00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:45.820
Tyler: Yeah.

379
00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:50.570
> P7: the the one that I would not like to see.

380
00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:51.340
Tyler: Here.

381
00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:52.610
> P7: In progress.

382
00:34:52.982 --> 00:34:54.469
Tyler: And why? Is that?

383
00:34:57.690 --> 00:34:58.400
> P7: Okay.

384
00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:00.280
> P7: real world, situation.

385
00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:03.959
> P7: The Air Force audited my account

386
00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:08.159
> P7: and decided the Va. Owes me $9,000.

387
00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:12.379
> P7: Not surprisingly, I'd really like that. $9,000.

388
00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:13.270
Tyler: Right.

389
00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:19.069
> P7: We're now into the second month, almost into the 3rd month. It's in progress.

390
00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:20.090
Tyler: Oh!

391
00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:27.860
> P7: The Va. Does not know, cannot tell me what is going on or how long it's going to take them to make up their mind.

392
00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:30.530
> P7: I want my money.

393
00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:33.899
> P7: and in progress is not very helpful.

394
00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:35.300
Tyler: Gotcha.

395
00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:48.479
> P7: On the other side of that same coin. I don't know that they can tell me any more than that, because obviously an amount $9,000. They're going to look at it carefully, and I don't know what bureaucracy has to deal with it.

396
00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:51.420
> P7: but I hate the word in progress.

397
00:35:51.420 --> 00:36:10.289
Tyler: Yeah, totally. That makes a lot of sense. So you're thinking about other experiences with the Va. Where you've submitted something, or the Va is meant to do something for you, and it could take months. So when you see in progress, it's like, Well, is this, gonna take months like the other things I've done. So it's not specific enough. Right?

398
00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:14.379
Tyler: What about reopened? What does that mean?

399
00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:23.009
> P7: Apparently it didn't get solved, and they reopened it because I wasn't satisfied with the 1st answer.

400
00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:23.540
Tyler: Okay.

401
00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:24.540
> P7: And

402
00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:30.350
> P7: I'm very interested. That's my highest priority on this screen, because

403
00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:40.880
> P7: I asked what I thought was a simple, straightforward question, and got what I think was not a simple, straightforward answer.

404
00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:42.650
> P7: And

405
00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:57.379
> P7: Whether it's my fault for not being able to communicate or their fault for not being able to communicate, we're trying to. We're trying to be nice to each other. But we're not solving the problem. And that's I'm really interested in that one.

406
00:36:57.380 --> 00:37:07.154
Tyler: Okay, yeah, that makes sense. So your description of it makes sense to me. And also it's helpful to know that you're particularly interested in in reading about that question.

407
00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:12.789
Tyler: before we do that, we're gonna do that in a minute. Before we do that.

408
00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:18.180
Tyler: The next thing I'd like you to do is is to try and find a question that's related to home loans.

409
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:20.000
> P7: Home. Well.

410
00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:22.609
> P7: Okay, well, that must be the other page.

411
00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:28.010
> P7: Okay, so there's the homo. I'm trying to get a

412
00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:30.059
> P7: what is COEI don't know

413
00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:33.989
> P7: from my Va.

414
00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:34.990
Tyler: And.

415
00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:36.370
> P7: Office assists me.

416
00:37:36.370 --> 00:37:37.170
Tyler: Okay.

417
00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:40.169
Tyler: So you found that, how'd you find that question?

418
00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:43.389
> P7: Well, I went to page 2, because I just

419
00:37:43.450 --> 00:37:45.660
> P7: scrolling down to look at all my

420
00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:51.450
> P7: questions, and again going back. Now I know that I have? 5.

421
00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:59.259
> P7: What is what is the proper word for this square? 5.

422
00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:03.729
> P7: The documents? 5. Categories, 5.

423
00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:07.730
> P7: Applications, 5. Records in my system.

424
00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:10.160
> P7: And this 5th record

425
00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:14.620
> P7: is the one that I was looking for, because I want to talk to you about my Va loan.

426
00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:28.590
Tyler: okay, cool. So you you scan through your questions looking for something that had to do with housing or or, home, loans. And that's how you found this question, which is on the second page.

427
00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:30.569
> P7: Not look at this.

428
00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:33.330
> P7: I looked at this.

429
00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:39.470
Tyler: Gotcha. Okay, that's really helpful. So you're reading the question as opposed to the category.

430
00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:42.620
Tyler: Yeah, that's super helpful.

431
00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:49.180
Tyler: is there any other way to find this question. Besides scanning

432
00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:50.880
Tyler: these cards.

433
00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:52.240
> P7: Well

434
00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:55.140
> P7: up here. I guess you're talking about these.

435
00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:59.260
> P7: Let's see, I'm going to click on filter by status. All.

436
00:38:59.260 --> 00:38:59.960
Tyler: Okay.

437
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:01.430
> P7: Oh.

438
00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:13.370
> P7: reply! Oh, well, those are the 3 things, and and I already know they're not going to be useful to me. So if I clicked on reply. I'd get this one, but I wouldn't have found it that way.

439
00:39:14.126 --> 00:39:16.970
> P7: Now I want to use the category.

440
00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:18.920
> P7: Okay, I could see

441
00:39:20.050 --> 00:39:23.819
> P7: being owned. Of of these 4 choices

442
00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:25.729
> P7: via loans has to

443
00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:27.779
> P7: do with the word housing.

444
00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:31.269
> P7: Va loan does not have to do with the

445
00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:32.810
> P7: veterans. Id card.

446
00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:46.719
> P7: And this is also I like this veterans. Id card Vic. I did not know that was an acronym, and now I know it, and if later on I see a Vic comment, someplace, I might even remember

447
00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:54.409
> P7: that you told me what that stands for. I do not know what Coe stands for, because I don't remember ever seeing that before today.

448
00:39:55.180 --> 00:40:00.864
Tyler: Yeah. Okay. Well, just so, you know, Coe, I think it stands for certificate of eligibility.

449
00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:02.090
> P7: Oh!

450
00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:02.700
Tyler: Yeah.

451
00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:03.550
> P7: Ideas.

452
00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:22.290
Tyler: Yeah, okay, that was really helpful. So we weren't using the filters. And then once you opened the filter by status, you were like. I still wouldn't be able to find my question about housing this way. But you open the category filter and you realize that that might actually be useful for you.

453
00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:24.180
Tyler: Right? Okay.

454
00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:31.830
Tyler: yeah, that's really helpful. And it's felt really quite obvious to on like how to use them or how they work. Right.

455
00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:32.590
> P7: Okay.

456
00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:33.430
Tyler: Okay.

457
00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:34.870
> P7: Look at this for a moment. Here.

458
00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:35.760
Tyler: Yeah.

459
00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:36.440
> P7: Okay.

460
00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:39.540
> P7: there's only 2 choices, but it's

461
00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:45.140
> P7: whoever decided to make newest to oldest. The default was very smart.

462
00:40:46.266 --> 00:40:54.109
> P7: I'm assuming that over the years. I'm going to have dozens of these, because I'm the kind of guy that complains all the time.

463
00:40:54.520 --> 00:41:02.470
> P7: I'm going to have more and more. But most of the old ones are resolved, and they're just on there for historical reasons.

464
00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:06.659
> P7: What I really care about is these 1st couple that

465
00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:10.929
> P7: I'm dealing with this month and last month? Right?

466
00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:14.049
> P7: This is the date.

467
00:41:14.310 --> 00:41:16.100
> P7: This is what

468
00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:19.489
> P7: I'm going to home in on, because

469
00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:21.309
> P7: if I

470
00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:23.960
> P7: send you a request.

471
00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:26.329
> P7: I deal with it by date.

472
00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:31.630
> P7: I set up this appointment this morning with you. You set up this appointment with me

473
00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:35.169
> P7: by date and time, not your name, not my name.

474
00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:43.780
> P7: When I was looking for the link, and all to make sure that I was ready this morning I went into my email and found it by date.

475
00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:47.429
> P7: Change the subject and show you something

476
00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:48.909
> P7: just a moment where.

477
00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:49.470
Tyler: Okay.

478
00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:50.070
> P7: There!

479
00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:53.619
> P7: Can you see my calendar?

480
00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:54.700
Tyler: I can. Yeah.

481
00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:58.590
Tyler: to your calendar person.

482
00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:00.788
> P7: Alright, just a moment.

483
00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:05.650
> P7: okay.

484
00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:09.179
> P7: read this, please.

485
00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:19.470
Tyler: This is an interview about how I use the various veterans, websites. The link to the interview can be found in an email that was sent to me September 13, th at 9 0. 7.

486
00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:21.240
Tyler: Okay.

487
00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:25.949
> P7: I was mad at myself because I didn't put in 9 0. 7 Pm.

488
00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:29.169
> P7: I had to look for it in 2 places, but.

489
00:42:29.170 --> 00:42:30.649
Tyler: Oh, okay.

490
00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:33.749
> P7: Okay, let me get rid of. Let me get rid of Calendar.

491
00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:35.420
> P7: and that's.

492
00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:43.120
Tyler: That's super helpful, though. That shows me how you think about things. And you're you're saying the date is a good anchor for you.

493
00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:51.879
> P7: And it's it's a subject that we all pretty much agree on. Earlier. We were talking about time and time zones.

494
00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:58.000
> P7: 9 o'clock is 9 o'clock, but 9 o'clock, New York, and 9 o'clock. La, is not the same thing.

495
00:42:58.753 --> 00:43:00.260
Tyler: Yeah, totally.

496
00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:18.550
Tyler: Okay, so that makes a lot of sense. And I think this is really helpful because i'm starting to see what is most useful to you on these cards, and maybe what's less useful? You mentioned that it's really useful that these cards are sorted in order of newest to oldest.

497
00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:23.470
Tyler: Is there a scenario where you'd ever want them to be sorted oldest to newest.

498
00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:36.260
> P7: I vaguely remember that about 2 years ago I asked the Va. A question about something, and it's the same thing has come up again. I want to go back and find it.

499
00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:36.820
Tyler: Okay.

500
00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:40.239
> P7: And so it would be helpful if I go back to the Ops. But

501
00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:44.240
> P7: I doubt if it's going to make any difference, because if I have

502
00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:57.889
> P7: 5 things on here, I can read through them in either direction. If I have a hundred things on here, then definitely, item number 57 is the one I'm looking for, and it's a long ways down, no matter which way I do it.

503
00:43:58.221 --> 00:44:00.540
Tyler: Right. I think that's a good point.

504
00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:06.040
> P7: The filter by category or status, hoping that it would shorten the list. But

505
00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:12.000
> P7: I don't think you can fix that. I think I would just have to scroll through until I found it.

506
00:44:12.130 --> 00:44:15.100
> P7: Just like I scroll through my emails to find it.

507
00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:26.649
Tyler: Awesome. Okay, that makes sense. And so in that situation, like, we're saying, there's a hundred questions. And I'm trying to find, like Number 57. And so it's gonna be a lot of like

508
00:44:26.951 --> 00:44:38.889
Tyler: scrolling through, or maybe using the filter is there anything else that could be helpful? And maybe it's not on this page right now. But is there anything else that could help you to find a question in that situation?

509
00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:42.689
> P7: Well, I know that the question was asked in

510
00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:44.370
> P7: 2022.

511
00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:47.680
> P7: And since you have it in date order.

512
00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:50.209
> P7: I can certainly scroll down

513
00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:59.090
> P7: and find either January or December of 2022, and then start looking, reading carefully. So that's gonna help me save a little time.

514
00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:06.420
> P7: And I'm going to again take a side subject. Here. I'm opening my email now.

515
00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:07.170
Tyler: Okay.

516
00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:14.350
> P7: Can you see that there are lots of emails.

517
00:45:14.350 --> 00:45:15.210
Tyler: Yes. Yeah.

518
00:45:15.210 --> 00:45:16.010
> P7: My bread.

519
00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:18.690
> P7: There's 28,000.

520
00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:19.995
Tyler: Okay.

521
00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:24.090
> P7: I don't delete anything. In fact, Google

522
00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:30.149
> P7: has a limitation, and they delete things off. So this only goes back about 6 years.

523
00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:32.100
Tyler: gotcha.

524
00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:35.450
> P7: When I want something, I flag it. This is your

525
00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:39.229
> P7: case. Okay? Notice. I have 44 flag

526
00:45:39.690 --> 00:45:41.070
> P7: down here.

527
00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:45.989
> P7: these bottom ones. Those are my life directives, and I keep them forever.

528
00:45:46.350 --> 00:45:50.879
> P7: others like oh, this is a book that I want to read.

529
00:45:51.010 --> 00:45:58.159
> P7: so I flagged it, and I can find it here, because I only have to go through 44 items to find it. And eventually I'll get rid of that.

530
00:45:58.270 --> 00:46:02.120
> P7: This is the tech support. Item, that I'm waiting for them to help me on

531
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:11.449
> P7: and then up here. This is a Zoom Meeting that's going to happen tomorrow tonight. As a matter of fact, and then I'll get rid of that.

532
00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:12.070
Tyler: Okay.

533
00:46:12.070 --> 00:46:14.499
> P7: But the point being that

534
00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:19.810
Tyler: Do you ever search on your email? Do you ever use that search bar.

535
00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:24.949
> P7: Yes, I do, and it works great if I can figure out what I'm searching for.

536
00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:26.689
> P7: So, for example.

537
00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:29.499
> P7: my daughter's name is [name].

538
00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:36.920
> P7: If I type in [first two letters]. It shows up lots of [name]s, and I don't really need to remember how to spell her name.

539
00:46:38.050 --> 00:46:41.140
> P7: But if I was trying to find you.

540
00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:48.080
> P7: I apologize. I don't remember your name on your screen. It, says Tyler, but that's the only reason I know.

541
00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:53.379
> P7: And even something as simple as Joe. I see his name there.

542
00:46:54.130 --> 00:46:56.496
> P7: I can't remember those things.

543
00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:57.530
Tyler: Yeah.

544
00:46:57.530 --> 00:47:03.190
> P7: It's my dyslexia, and part of it is, I have a traumatic brain injury, but I can keep about 200 to 300 words clear in my memory at any given time, and everything else gets lost, and I have to go get help.

546
00:47:13.362 --> 00:47:14.599
Tyler: That makes sense.

547
00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:16.950
> P7: Search is real great but it's not that great for me. Unless I have a really good idea of what I'm looking for.

550
00:47:24.010 --> 00:47:41.845
Tyler: Right. That's such a helpful description, and it makes a lot of sense to me. That for you search is actually like relying too much on your memory, and it's easier for you to read things in front of you and have it like sort of jog your memory, or like you're looking for a certain thing, and then when you see it, you're like, Oh, there it is!

551
00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:45.519
> P7: You use the word jog your memory, and that's a perfect description of what.

552
00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:45.870
Tyler: Andrew.

553
00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:46.720
> P7: Explain.

554
00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:48.220
Tyler: Awesome.

555
00:47:48.350 --> 00:48:04.199
Tyler: That makes a lot of sense, that that was super helpful for me [P7], so we've talked about a couple of things on this page. We're also coming up on 1 hour together. So I feel like in a in a moment, you're gonna need to take your medication right.

556
00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:06.769
> P7: At 9, 50.

557
00:48:06.770 --> 00:48:07.220
Tyler: 9, 6.

558
00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:09.420
> P7: I mean 5 0.

560
00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:12.079
> P7: Is when the alarm goes off.

561
00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:14.460
Tyler: So you've got some time. Okay, cool.

562
00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:17.709
Tyler: Do you want to take a break and grab some water or anything? Are you.

563
00:48:17.710 --> 00:48:21.662
> P7: I have water. I'm cheating, and I'm fine. Do you need to take a break? I.

564
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:22.959
Tyler: No, I'm all good.

565
00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:26.459
> P7: I want to be considered courteous to all 4 of you.

566
00:48:27.110 --> 00:48:42.269
Tyler: Oh, well, if anyone else on the call besides us needs to take a break, they can totally do that and come rejoin us. But perfect. Let's keep going. So the next thing that I'm hoping we can do is try and find a question that you submitted on August 24th.

567
00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:46.180
Tyler: it looks like you might have highlighted it already.

568
00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:47.852
> P7: Okay, so that then

569
00:48:49.110 --> 00:48:53.260
> P7: the way you laid it out was just perfect for me to find it.

570
00:48:54.010 --> 00:49:00.310
> P7: Because I remember today is September 20, th and I remember that about a month ago.

571
00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:02.719
> P7: so August 20, th

572
00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:04.790
> P7: I asked the question.

573
00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:08.880
> P7: 24th is close enough to 20th that. I think that's the one I asked.

### Details page

> P7: So I'm very anxious to click this. Can I click it now?

575
00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:18.409
Tyler: Before we click that we're going to click it in just a second. What do you think is gonna happen when we click that.

577
00:49:28.620 --> 00:49:30.279
> P7: And what their answer

578
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:35.139
> P7: was, and then something explaining why it was reopened.

579
00:49:35.310 --> 00:49:39.680
Tyler: Okay, gotcha. Okay, perfect. Let's go ahead and click on that when you're ready.

580
00:49:43.210 --> 00:49:53.250
> P7: Okay, so there it is. It took them from 24 to to 2 to get my answer, and since I don't know what it is, that may may not be we

581
00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:56.720

582
00:49:57.130 --> 00:50:02.770

583
00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:03.640
Tyler: Okay.

584
00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:10.629
Tyler: Gotcha. So immediately, looking at the dates which makes sense with what we've already talked about. What else is on this page?

585
00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:13.120
> P7: Okay, the plus mark is important.

586
00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:15.160
> P7: Because I can open it.

587
00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:17.880
> P7: Okay? Well.

588
00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:23.765
> P7: that was actually on the Virgil screen. So there was no new information. But it might have been longer here.

589
00:50:25.650 --> 00:50:43.759
> P7: My assumption of the way this system works is the 1st screen. Had the 1st 25 or 50 words, and this one would have up to 400 words, or whatever of my question. Your your system usually limits me to a few 100 words at maximum.

590
00:50:44.170 --> 00:50:44.860
> P7: And

591
00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:48.549

00:52:25.290 --> 00:52:26.180
> P7: Oh.

615
00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:31.269
> P7: apparently I haven't, Re. I haven't replied yet.

616
00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:53.275
Tyler: Okay. So there's a couple of things we're noticing on this page. And I wanna make sure we talk about all of them. So the 1st one, was. Obviously this reply is not good enough. And you explained exactly why that is, which is was really helpful. I completely hear that. It's a pretty general response to your question.

617
00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:56.529
Tyler: And in particular, you pointed out like

618
00:52:56.680 --> 00:53:14.399
Tyler: the link is a very general link. It's not like a very specific link. And that's frustrating. That makes sense. And then the next thing you just noticed was, it says, Send a reply. And so you said, Okay, I haven't sent a reply back to the Va. Yet. Is that right?

619
00:53:17.530 --> 00:53:19.940
> P7: I thought this, said

620
00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:22.319
> P7: your reply.

621
00:53:22.750 --> 00:53:25.500
> P7: which meant I had typed something.

622
00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:33.979
> P7: It doesn't say, you may reply. Do you wish to reply? This is where you send a message back to us.

623
00:53:34.730 --> 00:53:36.200
> P7: This is

624
00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:39.990
> P7: this is your question, and

625
00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:41.999
> P7: that is my question.

626
00:53:42.370 --> 00:53:42.800
Tyler: Right.

627
00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:47.850
> P7: This is the response from the Va, and that's the response from the Va.

628
00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:50.970
> P7: So using the same logic.

629
00:53:51.610 --> 00:53:54.290
> P7: what what does that mean?

630
00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:57.024
> P7: And

631
00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:01.760
> P7: now I see I can come down here and say

632
00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:07.119
> P7: whatever I want, but.

633
00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:11.850
> P7: I would say something like.

634
00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:20.370
> P7: what part of va.gov. What is

635
00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:24.229
> P7: only available to veterans? I'm a veteran, obviously.

636
00:54:26.470 --> 00:54:27.280
> P7: What

637
00:54:27.550 --> 00:54:29.550
> P7: what are you talking about? I?

638
00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:32.810
> P7: Let's let's go back and try English, you know.

639
00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:38.490
Tyler: Right? Okay. So for me, I'm picking up on like it was.

640
00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:46.480
Tyler: It's kind of hard to tell that you've already sent the Va. A reply back to their response. Because of this big send a reply

641
00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:48.190
Tyler: that comes next.

642
00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:49.560
Tyler: Is that right?

643
00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:54.210
> P7: Right have I have I already replied to them or not?

644
00:54:54.210 --> 00:54:58.439
Tyler: Yeah, what? What is this message? On September 12.th

645
00:55:01.930 --> 00:55:12.900
> P7: Well, I thought it was the message that I sent to them on September 12, th saying your answer wasn't helpful. Please tell me what part of va.gov to go to.

646
00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:15.550
> P7: But I don't know.

647
00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:19.019
> P7: Especially since we're in a hypothetical situation.

648
00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:20.920
> P7: Know what I did.

649
00:55:21.370 --> 00:55:27.560
> P7: But I know that on September 12 I did something, and they won't tell me what I did.

650
00:55:28.670 --> 00:55:31.870
Tyler: Okay. So you don't know what actually happened on September 12.th

651
00:55:32.050 --> 00:55:38.989
> P7: I may have replied to them, Thank you very much. I've now got my wife's Id cards, and the whole system is done.

652
00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:42.140
> P7: but then we go back to. Why was this reopened.

653
00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:51.100
Tyler: Okay, Gotcha. So it's not clear what happened on September 12.th Right? Now, yeah, okay, that makes sense.

654
00:55:53.470 --> 00:56:01.740
Tyler: is that you know how you went through. And you said, Oh, this plus sign is very important, and you opened it, and then you got to see some more information.

655
00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:05.140
Tyler: is.

656
00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:08.349
Tyler: if we click that plus sign on September 12.th

657
00:56:09.830 --> 00:56:11.579
Tyler: Is there any more information.

658
00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:15.640
> P7: No, I'm more fresher than I was.

659
00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:33.960
Tyler: Okay, yeah, that makes sense. I can see how that's that's not clear. And when we go through these different like headings on this page. So it says, August 24, th your question, September second. Response from Va. September 12.th Your reply to Va.

660
00:56:34.010 --> 00:56:36.730
Tyler: Is there anything confusing about that part.

661
00:56:37.890 --> 00:56:41.190
> P7: At 1st it looks perfectly logical.

662
00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:46.390
> P7: But now I realize that

663
00:56:46.590 --> 00:56:52.260
> P7: the person who wrote this program is using 2 different languages.

664
00:56:52.930 --> 00:56:57.200
> P7: The word your question is English, and I know what it means.

665
00:56:57.790 --> 00:57:01.939
> P7: The word response from Va is English, and I know what it means.

666
00:57:01.970 --> 00:57:06.790
> P7: Your reply to Va is Hungarian, and I don't know what it means.

667
00:57:08.030 --> 00:57:09.700
Tyler: Right? Okay.

668
00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:13.779
Tyler: that's that makes sense. So

669
00:57:14.130 --> 00:57:21.670
Tyler: your question makes sense response from Va makes sense. And then your reply to Va is not clear.

670
00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:27.520
Tyler: What do you think would be more clear? Let's say you had sent the Va. A message on September 12.th

671
00:57:28.386 --> 00:57:32.299
Tyler: That was replying back to what they sent you on September second.

672
00:57:32.370 --> 00:57:34.460
Tyler: How how might we describe that.

673
00:57:35.110 --> 00:57:35.740
> P7: Okay.

674
00:57:37.090 --> 00:57:39.270
> P7: I want you to watch my screen.

675
00:57:39.930 --> 00:57:44.249
> P7: I'm looking at response from Va, I click on plus.

676
00:57:44.580 --> 00:57:47.249
> P7: And I'm going to call that 25 words.

677
00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:51.360
> P7: I read it. Oh, now I know what their reply was.

678
00:57:52.070 --> 00:57:57.739
> P7: And I I didn't like that, and it doesn't surprise me because I do not like that.

679
00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:00.000
> P7: And I click here.

680
00:58:00.010 --> 00:58:01.020
> P7: and

681
00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:08.319
> P7: oh, that is my reply. I did not catch it. The fact.

682
00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:09.210
Tyler: Yeah.

683
00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:12.680
> P7: Okay, I I back up

684
00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:15.719
> P7: my mistake, my misreading.

685
00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:17.199
Tyler: Well, that's not a mistake.

686
00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:20.989
> P7: Would not have chosen. I would not have chosen those words.

687
00:58:22.350 --> 00:58:30.750
Tyler: That. That's totally not a mistake, I think. Part of what I'm noticing is that it's hard to to notice the

688
00:58:30.850 --> 00:58:33.558
Tyler: the content in this last

689
00:58:34.170 --> 00:58:35.194
Tyler: box?

690
00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:37.740
Tyler: so

691
00:58:37.970 --> 00:58:56.189
Tyler: I think there might be a couple of different reasons why that is. And so it was kind of helpful for me to just watch you go through. And I understood what you were waiting to see, and you weren't noticing it. So you didn't make a mistake. You actually have given us some good information. And I can see some ideas for how we might make that a little bit easier.

692
00:58:56.390 --> 00:58:59.639
> P7: Let me go back. And this is for the programmers.

693

698
00:59:11.170 --> 00:59:21.219

699
00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:25.920

700
00:59:26.030 --> 00:59:32.110

702
00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:42.959

703
00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:44.920
Tyler: Well.

704
00:59:45.704 --> 01:00:05.495
Tyler: I hear you, but I will say that. My philosophy, and that's why I have this role on my team is that you can't really be wrong. And usually we've done something that didn't work super well for you. So I think that was really helpful to watch you go through the page. I totally understand how you came to that sort of conclusion.

### Reply sent

Tyler: the next thing I want to do because we've talked about this page a little bit now is actually try and write the Va a message. So you started to type that I saw you type in help. You don't need to type a long message here. You're welcome to just type a short message. If you wanted to to turn on Dragon and show us how you might use that. You're welcome to do that as well.

01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:50.199
> P7: what you're telling me to do.

727
01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:54.220
> P7: My wife

728
01:01:55.630 --> 01:01:56.520
> P7: is

729
01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:58.610
> P7: still my dependent.

730
01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:00.930
> P7: and

731
01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:04.159
> P7: she needs an Id card.

732
01:02:05.590 --> 01:02:07.970
> P7: How do I go about getting it?

733
01:02:09.230 --> 01:02:15.840
> P7: If you're going to send me to a website, be specific as to where I go inside the website.

734
01:02:18.190 --> 01:02:19.190
> P7: Thank you.

735
01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:25.019
> P7: And now I go up here to the word review, go to spell checker.

736
01:02:25.170 --> 01:02:27.119
> P7: Oh, I got everything right.

737
01:02:27.350 --> 01:02:29.430
> P7: Whoops forgot to turn that off.

738
01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:34.520
> P7: Yeah.

739
01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:44.680
> P7: I reread it because, even though it was spelled correctly, it may not be what I want. I really don't understand what you're telling me to do. My wife is still my dependent.

740
01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:47.459
> P7: I want a comma there.

741
01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:51.299
> P7: She needs an id card. How do I get it?

742
01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:55.969
> P7: The same room

743
01:03:03.650 --> 01:03:04.570
> P7: oops

744
01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:06.910
> P7: hit the wrong button

745
01:03:17.070 --> 01:03:19.310
> P7: site. S, I'm T.

746
01:03:19.570 --> 01:03:20.320
> P7: E.

747
01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:40.019
> P7: Okay. Now, that's what I want to say to you. So I go here. I right click, I choose copy. And now I go back over here

748
01:03:40.170 --> 01:03:41.590
> P7: and I

749
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:42.899
> P7: paste it.

750
01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:44.110
> P7: and

751
01:03:44.990 --> 01:03:53.929
> P7: that may seem a long, complicated process to you. But considering what I had to do before I had dragon, this is absolutely marvelous.

752
01:03:54.229 --> 01:04:12.769
Tyler: Yeah, that was great to see, it seems like, it worked really well for you and it obviously does a pretty good job with the dictation. So that was awesome. Okay, cool. So we've got a message in here. And you feel happy with it. So let's go ahead and and send it when you feel ready to.

753
01:04:16.010 --> 01:04:26.180
> P7: Okay, I like that. It was submitted successfully. I don't know what it means specifically, but at least it got to the inbox of somebody.

754
01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:40.590
Tyler: Okay, cool. So you liked the success message, and it seemed pretty obvious right away to you that it had been submitted successfully. Okay, cool, and you don't know who it sent to you, said, how do you feel about not knowing that.

755
01:04:41.770 --> 01:04:46.609
> P7: Well, I'm I'm dealing with an office. I you know.

756
01:04:47.110 --> 01:04:47.800
> P7: Yeah.

757
01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:49.750
> P7: you.

758
01:04:50.250 --> 01:04:55.229
> P7: Tyler, are a person. But you, Tyler, are a team, a representative.

759
01:04:55.310 --> 01:05:01.380
> P7: and I'm really talking to your office, and you know you and I are trying to have a personal conversation. But

760
01:05:02.010 --> 01:05:06.590
> P7: you you are talking to me as a subject that tests

761
01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:14.640
> P7: person. And I'm talking to you as a teacher, a test giver, and we really don't care

762
01:05:14.730 --> 01:05:25.310
> P7: that much about the personalities of each other. I don't know whether what you had for breakfast, and I don't know how many kids you have, and you don't care whether I had breakfast yet or not.

763
01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:27.319
Tyler: Right? Okay.

764
01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:28.850
> P7: So

765
01:05:29.170 --> 01:05:45.850
> P7: this is, in my opinion, appropriate. It was submitted, it might be submit, say, submitted to Department XYZ. Of the da da da, and since I wouldn't know what any of those words mean, they'd probably be useful to me. Useless to me. Excuse me.

766
01:05:48.090 --> 01:05:49.319
Tyler: okay, that makes sense.

767
01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:54.280
> P7: Then it says it will within 7 business days. I like that.

768
01:05:54.507 --> 01:05:56.100
Tyler: Okay, what do you like about that?

769
01:05:56.840 --> 01:05:58.370
> P7: You should.

770
01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:02.689
> P7: ie. Don't count on it. Sometimes we get backlogged

771
01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:12.440
> P7: 7 business days. If you haven't heard from us by last. By next week you might want to contact us again to make sure it didn't get lost in the bureaucracy.

772
01:06:14.130 --> 01:06:17.040
> P7: Oftentimes I go someplace.

773
01:06:17.270 --> 01:06:20.209
> P7: and they say you need to be patient and wait.

774
01:06:21.570 --> 01:06:27.520
> P7: I'm willing to be patient. I'm also willing to call you every 5 min until it gets resolved.

775
01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:31.100
> P7: If you want me to be patient. Tell me how long.

776
01:06:31.630 --> 01:06:39.210
> P7: when I order a prescription? It's supposed to be here within 10 days, and on the 9th day I call you to say, where is it?

777
01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:43.489
> P7: If you don't tell me to wait 10 days, I call you on the second day.

778
01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:52.810
> P7: All that does is make me spend more time, which I have plenty of, and you waste time, which you don't have plenty of.

779
01:06:53.390 --> 01:06:57.609
> P7: Answering my phone call, saying, 2 days is not long enough. Be patient.

780
01:06:58.120 --> 01:06:58.540
Tyler: Yeah.

781
01:06:58.540 --> 01:07:03.250
> P7: 7 business days is a very nice rephrased word.

782
01:07:03.250 --> 01:07:15.250
Tyler: Oh, good. Okay. So that makes sense that you, as long as you're given a timeframe you're not really bothered. If it's 6 days or 7 days, but you just want to be sure how long you should wait before you get back in touch.

783
01:07:15.250 --> 01:07:19.870
> P7: Right, I mean, I don't know what's going on behind the scenes, so it might say

784
01:07:20.020 --> 01:07:21.360
> P7: 30 days.

785
01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:25.380
> P7: And be justified because

786
01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:27.719
> P7: I don't know what you're doing.

787
01:07:29.490 --> 01:07:33.759
> P7: an interesting thing to me. I had a a medical test.

788
01:07:34.110 --> 01:07:35.300
> P7: and

789
01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:42.500
> P7: the way it's done is the test is done, and then I see the doctor. About 2 h later.

790
01:07:43.170 --> 01:07:50.049
> P7: And a couple of months ago something went wrong, and the test results were ready for the doctor.

791
01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:51.270
> P7: So

792
01:07:51.640 --> 01:08:03.299
> P7: he talked to me about the half of the tests that he had the information on, and explained to me that he would get back to me with the rest of the information as soon as he could.

793
01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:20.310
> P7: And then, a couple of days ago, I got a phone call from his office, explaining to me what the rest of the test was, and what would the results were? And if you care, it was all good news. I'm healthy, but it took them a whole month to sort out whatever went wrong with the procedure that usually only takes 2 h.

795
01:08:24.510 --> 01:08:25.270
Tyler: Right.

796
01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:26.100
Tyler: but.

797
01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:28.110
> P7: They told me the truth.

798
01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:31.540
> P7: and that makes me so much happier than

799
01:08:32.050 --> 01:08:33.570
> P7: Don't worry about it.

800
01:08:33.850 --> 01:08:38.010
Tyler: Right. I think that makes a lot of sense. One thing I'm curious about is.

801
01:08:38.050 --> 01:08:43.280
Tyler: let's say that you you started to use this. Ask Va. Tool quite a lot.

802
01:08:43.370 --> 01:09:01.789
Tyler: And sometimes when you send the Va. A message, it tells you that you should receive a reply within 7 business days, and then other times when you send the Va. Message, it says you should receive a reply within 3 business days, or sometimes it'll say 10 business days. How would you feel if it was

803
01:09:01.830 --> 01:09:04.730
Tyler: changing, depending on your what you've sent.

804
01:09:04.950 --> 01:09:05.540
> P7: Okay.

805
01:09:06.189 --> 01:09:08.490
> P7: I would be very curious.

806
01:09:08.930 --> 01:09:14.380
> P7: is the reply. Time? Because I asked a different question.

807
01:09:14.750 --> 01:09:18.460
> P7: Or is the reply time? Because they're getting backlogged.

808
01:09:18.810 --> 01:09:19.540
Tyler: Okay.

809
01:09:19.870 --> 01:09:20.840
Tyler: Yeah.

810
01:09:21.029 --> 01:09:23.579
> P7: The Va disability. Right now.

811
01:09:24.109 --> 01:09:27.449
> P7: if you put in a Va disability request.

812
01:09:27.539 --> 01:09:31.109
> P7: you're supposed to get an answer within a hundred 20 days.

813
01:09:31.469 --> 01:09:34.599
> P7: The actual backlog is almost 3 years.

814
01:09:35.359 --> 01:09:36.829
> P7: That's a problem.

815
01:09:38.050 --> 01:09:38.560
Tyler: Everybody.

816
01:09:38.569 --> 01:09:42.839
> P7: Knows it's a problem, and they're trying to do something about. But

817
01:09:42.939 --> 01:09:49.749
> P7: the 120 days in that case is a joke, and they shouldn't put it up on the screen.

818
01:09:50.550 --> 01:09:57.070
> P7: They should tell you the truth, we are really backlogged. We're working as fast as we can. We are sorry

819
01:09:57.430 --> 01:10:01.899
> P7: calling us and yelling at us will not speed the process up.

820
01:10:03.540 --> 01:10:08.809
> P7: And in case you're wondering, I've tried calling, yelling at them, and it does not speed the process up.

821
01:10:09.030 --> 01:10:10.730
Tyler: Yeah.

822
01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:27.180
Tyler: okay, that makes sense. So your thought would be, is this actually because it's backlogged and if it is can you tell me what's going on. So it sounds like in general telling the truth and being transparent is what's most important to you versus like a certain specific number of days. You're expecting.

823
01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:30.279
> P7: Telling the truth, and being transparent.

824
01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:40.359
> P7: Is the exact thing. Way back. At the beginning of this conversation we talked about me sending secure messages to my mental health, doctor, and it doesn't work.

825
01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:44.930
> P7: The 27 different answers

826
01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:49.149
> P7: that were out and out lies really pissed me off.

827
01:10:49.260 --> 01:10:52.539
> P7: and I called the Vaig office about it.

828
01:10:54.070 --> 01:10:55.250
> P7: The truth

829
01:10:55.660 --> 01:11:01.139
> P7: that there's a lawsuit, and they're arguing about it annoys me. But at least it's the truth.

830
01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:02.750
Tyler: Yeah.

831
01:11:03.850 --> 01:11:05.420
Tyler: that makes sense to me.

### Cool down

Tyler: I'm seeing the time we've got about like 9 min left together,

833
01:11:13.410 --> 01:11:18.940
Tyler: so is there anything else you want to comment on for this specific page.

834
01:11:20.030 --> 01:11:21.449
> P7: Not really. I mean.

835
01:11:21.790 --> 01:11:25.909
> P7: I'm pleasantly surprised. What you walked me through here.

836
01:11:26.490 --> 01:11:29.319
> P7: Was 99% outstanding.

837
01:11:29.950 --> 01:11:35.460
> P7: And I hope my comments will help you make it that much better. But.

838
01:11:35.460 --> 01:11:36.230
Tyler: For sure.

839
01:11:36.230 --> 01:11:38.980
> P7: I'm going to click on this just to see what happens.

840
01:11:41.490 --> 01:11:42.050
> P7: And.

841
01:11:42.050 --> 01:11:49.240
Tyler: I think that link is a bit funny right now, just with this prototype. But yeah, if you click that you will, you will be back to where we started.

842
01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:51.840
> P7: Okay, so that you know it works real good.

843
01:11:53.830 --> 01:11:56.679
> P7: I wish you could have a different phone number.

844
01:11:57.390 --> 01:12:06.189
> P7: I don't know that you can, because it may be that complicated a system that it really has to go to the general practitioner type thing.

845
01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:14.260
> P7: Okay, I want to change the subject for a moment. You can see my computer screen right?

846
01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:14.900
Tyler: Right.

847
01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:17.980
> P7: And I I want your programmers to watch something.

848
01:12:18.050 --> 01:12:20.570
> P7: I'm clicking on Google Chrome.

849
01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:27.769
> P7: And instantaneously, as you can see.

850
01:12:28.420 --> 01:12:33.470
Tyler: So just so, you know, [P7], I think Chrome might have opened on your other screen.

851
01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:36.020
Tyler: Oh, there it is. Okay, just slow. Okay.

852
01:12:36.020 --> 01:12:36.770
> P7: Now

853
01:12:37.830 --> 01:12:42.970
> P7: I'm choosing this one, because that's the name I gave to what I want to go to.

854
01:12:47.250 --> 01:12:51.590
> P7: I'm choosing this because I know that's the only way this works.

855
01:12:58.910 --> 01:13:04.289
> P7: I'm going to choose sign in, but I'm going down because I know

856
01:13:04.650 --> 01:13:07.059
> P7: it already has my name in here.

857
01:13:07.710 --> 01:13:11.049
> P7: It already has my password. So I'm not typing anything.

858
01:13:14.950 --> 01:13:17.150
> P7: I'm going to click on this.

859
01:13:18.250 --> 01:13:22.050
> P7: I'm waiting. There's the message coming through.

860
01:13:24.490 --> 01:13:28.809
> P7: Wait for it. Wait for it right up here. Come on.

861
01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:39.350
> P7: Okay. It didn't come through. So I'm going to go to. Where is messaging?

862
01:13:45.130 --> 01:13:46.839
> P7: That's the one I want.

863
01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:51.319
> P7: I'm going to highlight this number. Oops didn't get it right

864
01:13:57.630 --> 01:13:58.340
> P7: neat.

865
01:14:06.030 --> 01:14:07.530
> P7: Copy the code.

866
01:14:07.580 --> 01:14:09.210
> P7: Go back over here.

867
01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:11.480
> P7: put the code in

868
01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:13.480
> P7: submit.

869
01:14:27.150 --> 01:14:30.609
> P7: are we there? No, it's it's redirecting again.

870
01:14:30.610 --> 01:14:32.170
Tyler: Yeah. It's just loading.

871
01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:33.480
> P7: Okay.

872
01:14:34.730 --> 01:14:37.690
> P7: everything's instantaneous. Okay?

873
01:14:44.730 --> 01:14:51.119
> P7: And I have an appointment with a doctor on October 21.st That's what I wanted.

874
01:14:51.950 --> 01:14:54.869
> P7: What I want your programmers to see is.

875
01:14:54.910 --> 01:14:59.299
> P7: I am a computer using a mouse I never

876
01:14:59.450 --> 01:15:05.710
> P7: typed in a password. I do not know what the password is. It's been so long. I can't remember it.

877
01:15:06.330 --> 01:15:10.239
> P7: The code comes through to the computer, not to my

878
01:15:11.230 --> 01:15:16.090
> P7: cell phone. So I don't need my cell phone and all of your security.

879
01:15:16.590 --> 01:15:18.850
> P7: BS. Is useless

880
01:15:19.450 --> 01:15:20.940
> P7: because

881
01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:22.980
> P7: the technology

882
01:15:23.590 --> 01:15:25.310
> P7: has bypassed it all.

883
01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:27.100
> P7: So.

884
01:15:28.630 --> 01:15:35.770
Tyler: And when you say that, what do you mean? Exactly, you're concerned about the security because of how you could get in through your computer alone.

885
01:15:35.770 --> 01:15:36.260
> P7: Okay.

886
01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:42.889
> P7: I'm not concerned, but I am annoyed that the the world is lying to itself.

887
01:15:44.420 --> 01:15:45.130
> P7: Okay.

888
01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:47.470
> P7: in the Va.

889
01:15:47.690 --> 01:15:50.230
> P7: There is a system you can share

890
01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:53.920
> P7: your medical records with civilian doctors.

891
01:15:56.060 --> 01:15:58.799
> P7: The choice is opt in or opt out.

892
01:15:59.970 --> 01:16:04.129
> P7: If you opt out. No civilian doctors can see your records.

893
01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:15.630
> P7: If you opt in, there are 250 hospitals across the United States, and any qualified doctor at any one of those 250 hospitals can see your records.

894
01:16:16.900 --> 01:16:18.530
> P7: They're not supposed to.

895
01:16:19.250 --> 01:16:22.990
> P7: and I assume they don't care. I mean, I'm not that interesting a person.

896
01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:24.070
> P7: but

897
01:16:24.390 --> 01:16:25.510
> P7: that's

898
01:16:25.530 --> 01:16:28.313
> P7: a lawsuit waiting to happen

899
01:16:29.020 --> 01:16:40.049
> P7: because my ex wife. My ex-wife works in San Francisco at the hospital, and she's going to look at my medical records and sue me. And I'm going to blame the va.

900
01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:45.460
> P7: okay, that's a very easy example to give. But this one here

901
01:16:46.310 --> 01:16:53.500
> P7: secure messaging, secure portal, secure. Blah blah implies a lot of things that don't exist.

902
01:16:54.320 --> 01:17:00.599
> P7: Why do they do the double authentication? And I have to get that code word. You saw that I had trouble doing that.

903
01:17:02.020 --> 01:17:09.389
> P7: It's all bypassed. I don't even know how I set it up. It just all happened, and suddenly I discovered

904
01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:11.220
> P7: that I don't have to

905
01:17:11.470 --> 01:17:14.510
> P7: type in my password. I don't have to remember it.

906
01:17:15.450 --> 01:17:20.310
> P7: If you could come to my house and sit in front of this computer, you can get into my system.

907
01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:21.190
Tyler: Right?

908
01:17:21.790 --> 01:17:40.419
Tyler: Yeah, I can see how that's concerning for you. And there's different reasons why that's happening. One of them is your your Browser is saving your password and your and your username and so that's why it's coming up. And it's just automatically filled in. And there are ways you can turn that off if you don't want it.

909
01:17:40.540 --> 01:17:54.917
Tyler: I will say, given that you aren't remembering your password. That will make it more difficult for you to sign in. So it's a very difficult b[P7]ce in general between security. And then also needing to get into your own system.

910
01:17:55.410 --> 01:18:09.460
Tyler: there's other Mfa options or multi factor, authentication options. So one option you're using is getting a text message with a code. There are other options, some of which can make it.

911
01:18:10.596 --> 01:18:20.119
Tyler: potentially more secure because it's not all through your computer but again, that's a b[P7]ce, because some of them are more difficult to use. So.

912
01:18:20.371 --> 01:18:24.080
Tyler: If it's something that you you want to learn about, I can send you a link.

913
01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:28.640
> P7: No, I I'm perfectly happy because it sympathize my life.

914
01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:30.230
> P7: My

915
01:18:30.350 --> 01:18:32.570
> P7: my desire is

916
01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:36.249
> P7: you, as a programmer.

917
01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:38.010
> P7: should know

918
01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:40.570
> P7: that this happens.

919
01:18:41.050 --> 01:18:43.539
> P7: Because maybe you care.

920
01:18:44.255 --> 01:18:44.750
Tyler: Yeah.

921
01:18:44.750 --> 01:18:50.789
> P7: Maybe maybe you in your big meeting and talked it over with all the other programmers, decided

922
01:18:50.860 --> 01:18:54.670
> P7: we're going to let the lazy people get away with this

923
01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:58.869
> P7: because we're trying not to drive people crazy.

924
01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:04.569
> P7: and we'll just have it possible that we can have extra security for the people that care about it.

925
01:19:05.285 --> 01:19:06.000
Tyler: Yeah.

926
01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:10.410
> P7: But don't think that the website is secure

927
01:19:11.650 --> 01:19:12.790
> P7: when

928
01:19:13.260 --> 01:19:15.710
> P7: you let me get away with this.

929
01:19:16.450 --> 01:19:23.360
> P7: I'm not telling you how to do your job. I'm telling you this is a question you have to consider in your job.

930
01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:36.428
Tyler: Yeah, for sure. I think that makes a lot of sense. And it's a good thing for us to think closely about and obviously, the Va like security is really high priority. So that that makes a lot of sense.

931
01:19:36.740 --> 01:20:00.710
Tyler: I also just noticed the time we've just come up on an hour and a half, and I don't want to take too much of anybody's time. But before we wrap up, is there anything else that you want to comment on about using this website today, it sounded like overall. It worked fairly well for you. We definitely noticed some things that we can. We can try and fix or think about a little bit more but anything else you wanna you wanna close with.

932
01:20:04.570 --> 01:20:08.889
> P7: I was very impressed with your layout and what we did today.

933
01:20:10.330 --> 01:20:11.940
> P7: maybe

934
01:20:11.980 --> 01:20:15.830
> P7: up in the top here on. Ask Va. You.

935
01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:16.180
Tyler: And so.

936
01:20:16.180 --> 01:20:21.030
> P7: Something like, if it's a medical question, we're not really set up to

937
01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:22.869
> P7: answer that

938
01:20:24.300 --> 01:20:25.450
> P7: and

939
01:20:26.030 --> 01:20:30.219
> P7: so this little thing here, this is the kind of thing I'm talking about.

940
01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:33.779
> P7: It's helpful to me.

941
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:46.079
> P7: I know that I can back up to this level. I don't have to go all the way back to Va. Home to try and figure out where I missed my steps. So May. There's maybe there's more than one

942
01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:52.980
> P7: area under contact us. And so contact us says, if you have a medical pro question.

943
01:20:53.330 --> 01:20:58.320
> P7: go here. If you have a technical question, go there. And so.

944
01:20:58.320 --> 01:20:58.700
Tyler: Yeah.

945
01:20:59.290 --> 01:21:05.880
> P7: I liked this layout. I'm sure that there are better ones. I can't think of any but

946
01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:07.580
> P7: the

947
01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:10.930
> P7: sort filtering thing I've already told you

948
01:21:11.050 --> 01:21:16.129
> P7: I am going to home in on dates, because that's a

949
01:21:17.430 --> 01:21:21.869
> P7: finite, universal, defined word.

950
01:21:23.190 --> 01:21:23.840
Tyler: Right.

951
01:21:24.370 --> 01:21:31.670
> P7: And I like that. You have submitted. And then the date that it was changed, or something was done about it.

952
01:21:33.570 --> 01:21:39.959
> P7: I don't understand the reopened yet. I don't know what that really means, but it doesn't matter, because I now know

953
01:21:40.030 --> 01:21:43.620
> P7: that I don't have an answer, and I got to ask the question again.

954
01:21:43.750 --> 01:21:44.800
> P7: Yeah.

955
01:21:45.980 --> 01:21:46.570
> P7: again

956
01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:51.549
> P7: you. In my opinion, you're b[P7]cing this

957
01:21:51.630 --> 01:21:53.440
> P7: trying to address.

958
01:21:54.105 --> 01:22:01.140
> P7: It's it's 2 million veterans, and they're not all like me, I mean I'm perfect, but some of them are not.

959
01:22:02.090 --> 01:22:04.139
> P7: They deal with them.

960
01:22:04.330 --> 01:22:07.830
> P7: And so, writing a website that can deal with a

961
01:22:07.940 --> 01:22:15.409
> P7: high school dropout and a Phd. At the same time is hard, and I think your people did a pretty good job. And I

962
01:22:15.590 --> 01:22:25.100
> P7: I'm impressed with this thing. Little things like telling you how many extra, how many questions there are, and how it's archived.

963
01:22:27.550 --> 01:22:38.730
> P7: you might add something where you where I can delete old messages. I would never do that. But people, some people like to delete things that are off, and they just have the open subjects

964
01:22:38.900 --> 01:22:40.050
> P7: listed.

965
01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:41.030
Tyler: Yeah.

966
01:22:43.010 --> 01:22:48.790
Tyler: Awesome. That was all really helpful. Recap and I think there's a lot of things in there

967
01:22:49.106 --> 01:22:54.913
Tyler: for us to think about, but also a lot of a lot of positive things. I think your comment about

968
01:22:55.330 --> 01:23:18.930
Tyler: you know. Maybe you should use this tool for these questions, but not for medical questions is a really great point. Because I think that is an issue with ask Va, it's not necessarily clear when it's best to use this tool or another tool? So I really appreciate that. [P7], I think I think that's all of my questions. For today. I did want to give you a chance. Did you have any questions for me?

969
01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:21.430
> P7: No, I I

970
01:23:21.660 --> 01:23:26.110
> P7: I am very happy, excited, and pleased to personally be able

971
01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:30.149
> P7: to participate and help you do this because

972
01:23:32.300 --> 01:23:49.739
> P7: way back, when I was programming I would write a program, and what we did then was what's called walk down the hall. We would walk down the hall to someone that we didn't know and knew nothing about us, and said, Here's a program. Try this and stand over their shoulder to see what would happen.

973
01:23:49.740 --> 01:23:50.250
Tyler: Yeah.

974
01:23:50.250 --> 01:23:54.739
> P7: And quite often we say, oh, didn't expect you to do that.

975
01:23:54.940 --> 01:23:59.900
> P7: and then go back and rewrite the program. And that's sort of what you're doing, and

976
01:24:00.210 --> 01:24:04.580
> P7: it's a necessary, and I'm happy that you're doing it. Step.

977
01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:06.890
Tyler: That's awesome.

978
01:24:06.890 --> 01:24:13.790
> P7: I'm glad to be your guinea pig, and I have. No, I have no sensitivity about being the word guinea pig. I think

979
01:24:14.260 --> 01:24:18.579
> P7: you guys need guinea pigs, and I'm happy to help you

980
01:24:18.940 --> 01:24:21.530
> P7: do your job by being.

981
01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:29.650
> P7: And again, if if some of my ideas were stupid, I don't take offense. You're not required to do anything.

982
01:24:29.730 --> 01:24:38.179
> P7: but except for give it legitimate consideration. And if your legitimate consideration decides that I'm wrong, I'm not offended.

983
01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:52.819
Tyler: Yeah, well, I appreciate that. And I love that that context, and and what you called it walking down the hall. So we really appreciate your time? Obviously, you're not a stranger to why, we think this is really important

984
01:24:53.290 --> 01:24:54.420
Tyler: to chat

985
01:24:54.610 --> 01:25:14.599
Tyler: to folks like you. And this has been really awesome. I hope you keep taking part in research with the Va. And if you have any questions, you're gonna get an email after the study. And you can ask them any questions you have, and I will pass along your feedback about the time zone thing, because I think that's an easy thing for us to fix but yeah, I hope you have a lovely rest of your day, [P7].

986
01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:23.129
> P7: I do thank you very much for letting me participate, and good luck on your projects. And look forward to the next time you choose me.

987
01:25:23.420 --> 01:25:27.259
> P7: Okay? So I'm gonna click on. Stop sharing. Now, is that okay?

988
01:25:27.260 --> 01:25:33.360
Tyler: Yeah, that's perfectly fine. And then I'm gonna end the call. So we'll we'll all jump out of the zoom room in a second. Okay.

989
01:25:33.540 --> 01:25:34.280
> P7: Okay.

990
01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:35.550
Tyler: Awesome bye.

991
01:25:35.550 --> 01:25:36.270
> P7: Bye.
