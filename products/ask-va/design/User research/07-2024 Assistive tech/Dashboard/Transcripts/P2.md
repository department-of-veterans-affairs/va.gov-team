### Warm up

Thomas: Okay. So as you've heard, I've started the recording. And again, I'd like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today.

> P2: Yes, I am.

Thomas: Thank you.

Thomas: Alright.

Thomas: now, to begin with, we'd like to learn a little bit more about your experience with the with the Va. And our online services. I'm curious, [P2], how long have you been a Veteran.

> P2: since 2005. 

Thomas: Okay? And during this time have you ever contacted the Va online or over the phone.

> P2: Yes, several times.

Thomas: Okay? And

Thomas: when you contact them, what is your preferred method of contacting such as like going online, preferring to call? Or is there another way that you.

> P2: I I used to use the phone calls

> P2: and you leave voice mails, and I've never got a response. So I got to the point where I went to my appointments and

> P2: assisted to see, insisted to see that doctor make that appointment that I needed so.

Thomas: can you? Can you tell me about a time, maybe, where you contacted the Va and you you mentioned here with regards to using the phone call, not receiving responses. When you, when you ended up getting

Thomas: responses from the Va. How was the support that you received.

> P2: When I left phone calls it was maybe

> P2: 4 to 5 days later.

> P2: You know, but and when I was in person I would get an instant response there. So.

Thomas: Right

Thomas: When have you ever heard of? Ask Va before?

> P2: No.

Thomas: Okay?

Thomas: So

Thomas: with what we're gonna be kind of looking at today is a a section that is already live on on va, it's a sub domain ask.va.gov but what we're gonna be looking at today is a way that we're trying to

Thomas: improve the overall experience for folks who are on mobile devices using assistive technology and so forth. And so one of the things is that in this.

Thomas: in in these sessions, that as we're looking with folks for using assistive technology, you had mentioned that you're using voice over and and being a veteran since 2,005, how long have you been using voice over as an assistive device? Technology.

> P2: Was 2,005.

Thomas: Since 2,005. Okay, and it it. And is it primarily been voice over on on the Mac?

Thomas: that you've used.

> P2: No actually

> P2: I went from zoom text to jaws

> P2: to what do they call it? the dragon program? and I I just liked it voice over better.

Thomas: Okay.

> P2: Oh, sorry!

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: And

Thomas: it's really amazing that you've used all of these different technologies and settled on voice over so is voice over something you've used like ever since 2,005 on on Mac. Or is this something that, like voice over has been more of a recent past, few years.

> P2: Actually, I played with it a little bit.

> P2: I think when I found out apple syncs all of his products together.

> P2: It actually made me jump back to voice over because if I want to start on a project on my phone I can finish it through my computer. You see what I'm saying. So I don't have to have my computer with me all the time. I could actually dig stuff up from my phone

> P2: through my computer. So.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: right. cool.

Thomas: the I. So as I as we talked before, before we started this you, you said that you're familiar using zoom and sharing your screen while using voice over correct.

> P2: That is correct.

Thomas: Okay. Alright. So one of the things that we're going to look at today like I said as a as a website. So if you want to start sharing your screen, and then I can provide a link.

Thomas: I can either say it to you or share it within the chat.

> P2: So you just share a Google chat.

Thomas: Share it in the chat.

Thomas: Okay, I've placed it within the chat.

> P2: Okay, hold on. We gotta stop our bracket.

Thomas: Okay, so.

> P2: Delete the chat box and open this.

Thomas: I'm sorry that cut out just a little bit the last words that you said there, [P2].

Thomas: of course.

> P2: Give me a second.

Thomas: Okay.

> P2: It's open.

> P2: Course.

> P2: Boardroom.

> P2: Yes.

> P2: yeah. She gets correct

> P2: time.

Thomas: Yep.

> P2: You see what's on my screen? Correct.

Thomas: Right now I see a black screen. I see little orange dot.

> P2: Okay, there you go. Yeah, perfect. That green card was up. I'm sorry.

Thomas: All right. Talk to.

> P2: I like to do.

Thomas: That's alright. Well, thank you so much for that. That's great that you got that all up and running so I can see where you're at on. Ask Va.

> P2: Right.

Thomas: Alrighty. So let's see here, alright. So today, before we kind of

Thomas: go through the website, I'm just gonna give you a little context for you on this. Okay.

> P2: Well.

Thomas: Alright. So this is a tool called Ask Va, it's a way for veterans to contact the Va and ask a question online. So for today's session, we're going to pretend, like you're asking the Va. A question about a recent experience that you had.

Thomas: Oh, you know what I have the wrong.

Thomas: Some reason

Thomas: my script changed on me. Sorry.

Thomas: Know how that

Thomas: one second

Thomas: Whoa! Don't know what happened.

Thomas: Alright! Let me run back down to

Thomas: the beginning of this again, right?

> P2: Okay.

Thomas: Alright let's see.

### Dashboard

Thomas: Alright. So

Thomas: before. So going back to my script, the the correct script so we're going to pretend that you've recently asked the Va. Question, and today you just signed into your account on va.gov to read Va's reply to your question. We're gonna go through a couple of different tasks. And and I'll explain it as we as we go now, as we want to understand as you navigate. We wanna understand kind of like what's going through your mind

Thomas: and how your assistive technology is supporting you. And I'll try to stay quiet while you're focusing on the task. And what your screen reader is announcing. And cause right now, I I don't believe on with the mobile device and voice over that we can hear, hear the screen, reader.

> P2: Okay, can y'all hear my screen, reader?

Thomas: No, not right now.

> P2: Did you hear that.

Thomas: No.

> P2: Oh, oh, well, that's weird!

Thomas: That's and that's okay. But we, you know, as you're kind of going through this, you're getting the information from your screen, reader, and as you're kind of going through it, you know. Just kind of talk aloud about, you know, like what you're hearing, and kind of.

> P2: 50.

Thomas: As we kind of go through this, we want to make sure that you're kind of oriented to the site as well. Okay.

> P2: Okay.

Thomas: Alright.

Thomas: Oh.

Thomas: so

Thomas: but again, if there's if there's ever a time where you need to make sure that I'm paused. you know, if there's a or while we're paused. If there's anything surprising or confusing or helpful, just call that out. Okay.

> P2: I gotcha.

Thomas: Alright!

> P2: Okay. So I'm at the every time where it says, Sba.

> P2: And they said, I can get answers with.

> P2: I should receive answer in about 7 business days.

> P2: okay. Gives me

> P2: basically what I'm

> P2: how to start.

> P2: and it gives me what I can ask questions about.

> P2: Look at that.

> P2: Oh, okay.

> P2: I don't think you can.

> P2: I don't think we were asked, of course, compared

> P2: better, but up there.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: Now, [P2], when you get down to a section and it looks like

Thomas: what's interesting here is, I'm not sure if I see the button or not. That you're gonna be looking for

Thomas: I might need to actually bring up my screen here

Thomas: for staging.

> P2: Okay.

Thomas: Is. Do you see a button on there? Within an area about a research study sign in to ask a question.

> P2: What

> P2: I got a starter question without signing in. I have a link for that one.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: it might.

Thomas: okay, it would have been above the information that you're seeing right now, actually.

Thomas: And I didn't see.

> P2: I'm sorry I'm getting over a summer call, so.

Thomas: Oh, that's right.

> P2: No, I don't have a hyperlink on that one.

Thomas: Yeah.

Thomas: Okay. No.

> P2: You know what I've been studies where it both been a hyperlink there, but it wasn't so.

> P2: Yeah.

Thomas: Alright. So what I'm gonna do. [P2] is back in the chat

Thomas: I'm going to provide.

Thomas: I'm going to see if I can provide another link.

> P2: Okay.

Thomas: That should get us into the dashboard.

> P2: Oh, gosh!

Thomas: [P2], let me ask you this on your

Thomas: browser. You have open. This is I. It does. It looks like it looks like it's safari.

> P2: Correct.

Thomas: Is it in?

Thomas: Do you know if it is in a like a reader, mode.

> P2: Yes.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: And that might be the reason

Thomas: why those buttons are not showing up.

Thomas: Okay.

> P2: No, it's just saying it doesn't have any heading that doesn't have any hyperlinks.

Thomas: Yeah. Do you know, if is so like, when I turn on my reader mode, it actually takes away a lot of those buttons. Is there a way for you to

Thomas: exit out of the reader mode.

> P2: I don't believe so.

Thomas: Hmm

Thomas: so normally down in the the URL bar, which is down at the bottom, there's a little upper and lowercase a

Thomas: I didn't know if there was anything down there.

> P2: All I got is Tabs bookmark.

> P2: They're

> P2: forward that

> P2: and refresh.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: [P2], let me ask you this. Would it be possible to open up this page in a different browser?

> P2: Oh!

Thomas: Or, Evan said.

Thomas: if you do one more swipe, maybe that might get you to the

Thomas: The reader mode out of the reader, mode.

> P2: Page settings.

Thomas: Not the page settings that's so that might just deal with increased text size, color things like that. And so there might be just one.

Thomas: Hmm

Thomas: so go back to that. try try doing that settings again

Thomas: right there. Whoop!

> P2: This one.

Thomas: One more.

Thomas: Nope. Oh, sorry. Go back

Thomas: right about

Thomas: there. There. Okay.

> P2: Website, setting.

Thomas: It might be within the website settings.

Thomas: Listen to Page. Oh, see?

Thomas: Hide, reader, that's yeah that it. That's it. Right there. Yep.

> P2: Okay.

Thomas: Yeah, perfect. Yay, we got it.

> P2: Okay. Yep.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: So now, navigating back down

Thomas: to a section where you're going to see

Thomas: or I'm sorry you're gonna hear research study sign in to ask a question.

> P2: Okay.

Thomas: And then one more. There you go. You're right in the you're in the section now and then. The next button you come to will be what we need.

Thomas: Okay, right there. Oh.

Thomas: up back one. There you go.

> P2: But there is no hyperlink here.

Thomas: Yeah, it's kind of strange in how that particular button is basically just set up to to get us into this page right here.

> P2: Oh, gotcha! Okay.

Thomas: Okay. But I was like.

> P2: Cause. That's why I was struggling. I'm like, okay, because if I hear a link, there's a whole link right there. So.

Thomas: Okay. So when you hit that button, or when you landed on that button, it did it not give you any information? Or did it. Just say sign in

Thomas: oh, don't! And you know what. Don't worry about it. I I didn't know if you just remembered or not.

> P2: Yeah.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: Alright. Well, that's good to know. So now we're on the page that we need to be on, and I'm gonna try to head back over to my script here again.

Thomas: Let's see here.

> P2: Yeah.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: all right.

Thomas: So what I'd like for you to do is just take a moment and orient yourself on this page. Okay, so and then once you finish, I'd like you to explain to me

Thomas: what this page is about.

> P2: Okay.

> P2: What? I got this scrolling through real quick. You can ask pretty much questions on anything and everything.

> P2: You know, it was a guy that asked, you know about his wife's Id or his disability compensation claim? Logging on to the app and stuff like that, and it gives you a link oldest and newest

> P2: and it actually categorizes the answers

> P2: from newest to oldest. That's pretty neat. Didn't know that actually existed. But

> P2: yeah.

Thomas: Cool so did you? So you found the information sounds like pretty useful on the page.

> P2: Yeah, you know it. It was very self explanatory, and it was

> P2: you don't have to go through all the questions to

> P2: figure out. You know what question that you did? Because it was like, okay, this question was a conversation and picture question. This was an id question. This was an app question, so it was very decisive. And you don't have to go through every question that you asked the Da about, you know. So I think that's very handy. That's like,

> P2: basically a balanced system for questions, you know. So

Thomas: Okay, so it's a filing system for questions. And you said that. So when we when we got into this page we're basically pretending like you signed in. So whose questions are we looking at?

> P2: I guess we're looking at my questions.

Thomas: Okay. Great is there anything that you found confusing as you navigated around the page at all?

> P2: No, not at all.

> P2: I just. I looked at the questions. I really didn't get. The answers to the questions. Cause, I basically scroll through.

Thomas: And you you'd mentioned that there's a link what is the link for.

> P2: What do you mean?

Thomas: I was trying to see if one of my colleagues had

Thomas: maybe ask this. Was there any with regards to the links. Did you find any links on the page.

> P2: I think I've created.

> P2: Yeah.

> P2: I asked a new question. I had a link on it.

> P2: Yeah, I believe.

Thomas: Okay, was there any other links on the page that you found.

> P2: Huh!

Thomas: Were. Were there any other links on the page that you had found? Besides, ask a new question.

> P2: Yeah. Every answer.

> P2: Add a link on it.

> P2: Well, every question. After the question the answer had a hyperlink on it, as well.

Thomas: Okay.

> P2: Yeah.

Thomas: Alright! Great!

Thomas: Alright! So you'll notice there's a few questions on this page. Now, what I'd like for you to do is find a question that has a reply from the Va.

Thomas: And I'll give you a couple of minutes to navigate around. And after you finish, explain to me which question that you found.

> P2: Okay. I don't.

Thomas: Oh, sorry we didn't want to go into a question details. Page just yet. Sorry it was. We just wanted to try to stay on that page.

> P2: Oh!

Thomas: I'm sorry

Thomas: you might.

Thomas: and I know that it's gonna if you hit the back button. We're gonna go back out to that initial landing page. And so just scroll back down to that

Thomas: one button to log in.

> P2: I've got to go do all the

> P2: go back there.

Thomas: Yeah, sorry about that.

> P2: Okay.

Thomas: And that button right there. Whoop! Sorry.

Thomas: Go back. Yeah, just a little bit.

Thomas: When it says sign in or create an account.

Thomas: There you go.

> P2: Okay.

Thomas: Alright. So now we're back on this page, and just look going through the cards just seeing if you can find a way to find any one of the cards. That's that helps you to know that. Maybe the Va. Has, replied.

> P2: Gotcha? Okay? Gotcha. Okay,

Thomas: So have you been able to identify anything that might have a reply from the Va.

> P2: Not really

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: Is there anything that might help that

Thomas: would let you know that there is a reply from the Va.

Thomas: Would there be anything on the page that would help you? That you can think of? That might help you to know that there's a reply from the Va.

> P2: You know it's it. It kind of kept saying replied, but.

> P2: It doesn't

> P2: guest one.

> P2: That one had no reply on it.

Thomas: Okay.

> P2: It was this was replied with, so I'm thinking the Va. Got in contact with them.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: So when you landed on that

Thomas: little tag there, what did it tell you? What did it say to you? What? What did your screen, reader say.

> P2: If they replied.

Thomas: Okay

Thomas: is with regards to what you hear like replied in progress. Does that help you to know anything about your questions?

> P2: What do you mean?

Thomas: Does that give? Wait when you hear things like in progress? Or replied, does it? Trying to think of maybe how to ask this question, does that give you like a is that mentioning like a status for the card? Or what.

> P2: Replied. Mean they got back with you in progress means

> P2: they haven't got the specifics, the specifics down for your question. But yeah,

> P2: because, like, I say, I think 2 replies. But I was okay.

> P2: What questions were those 4? That's why I had to scroll back up to the top. So.

Thomas: Yeah. Okay.

Thomas: would there be another way aside from that little tag there.

Thomas: do you think that there would be another way to find if any of the questions that you had submitted had a reply, or would that be the only way.

> P2: Filter by status.

Thomas: Okay. What? What would that do?

> P2: with me, I think.

> P2: talk about status to let you know what's been replied to, and what's due at farmers.

> P2: Oh!

Thomas: So the next thing I'd like for you to do is to find a question that is related to home loans.

> P2: Looks.

Thomas: Not sure why that brought you all the way down to the bottom of the page when you you clicked on the pagination right.

> P2: So.

Thomas: Little number 2.

Thomas: Yeah.

Thomas: For some reason it brought you to the bottom of the page. I'm not sure why.

> P2: Yeah, okay.

> P2: okay, I got, I'm there.

Thomas: Alright! Great so a couple of questions here is that, did you have any difficulty navigating to this second page of questions?

> P2: Actually what I did was, is that where? That question?

> P2: The last question on that page was it? Said page one and page 2. So I clicked on page 2, and it put me all the way at the bottom of page 2. So I had to swipe back up. So that that was

> P2: That was probably the weirdest thing that ever happened to me. Yeah, going to another page. But yeah, it was

> P2: no big deal. Okay.

Thomas: would there have been another way to also have found this question a question related to home loans.

> P2: Not as of yet.

Thomas: Okay, so

Thomas: when you had looked at the different types of things back.

> P2: Well, yeah, I could. I coulda did

> P2: newest. What was it

> P2: most recent?

> P2: Give me one second.

Thomas: Okay.

> P2: Your court.

> P2: I've done that.

Thomas: Okay, newest to oldest.

> P2: Right.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: is there anything else within? Those options up there that might help.

> P2: How could I do it? Filter by category?

> P2: Okay.

> P2: yeah.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: do all of those things. Make sense. In terms of those filters.

> P2: It does, because I could like you said I could have got there a whole lot sooner.

Thomas: Okay.

> P2: And getting discombobulated by being at the end of second page. So, yeah.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: Alright. Now, the next thing that we're gonna do is that this is the last task on this page is that I'd like you to find a question that you submitted that you submitted on August 24.th

> P2: I used to workman.

Thomas: Well, you're gonna find a question that you submitted on August 24.th

> P2: I don't know.

Thomas: Alright! Great! Did you have any problems finding that question.

> P2: No. I just went from newest to oldest.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: Alright

### Details page

Thomas: now, what we're gonna do is we're gonna read the reply from the Va. Now, what I'd like for you to do is show me how you would navigate to read what the Va. Replied to your question. That you submitted on August 24.th

> P2: Info.

> P2: Okay, I will go

> P2: like the details on this.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: And you can go ahead and.

> P2: Link.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: alright. So before we talk about this page,

Thomas: one of the things is, is that it seemed like you were able to get to this page fairly easily is, did you have any problems.

> P2: Not at all.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: So the 1st thing I'd like you to do on for this is to find the reply the Va. Sent to you.

> P2: Wow!

> P2: I'm sorry.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: great so can you talk to me a little bit? Talk to me a little bit about how you navigated? To the reply on the page.

> P2: 1st I found a question.

> P2: you know you can't have a question without an answer, so I was

> P2: pretty much looking for if I ask if I if I, if I ask you a question.

> P2: The next thing would probably be the answer that you know

> P2: I asked you the question for so that was

> P2: pretty much self explanatory. Okay.

Thomas: Cool.

Thomas: Alright, so I'm gonna give you some time to read the reply from the Va. And then I'd like you to kind of summarize their reply to me.

> P2: Okay?

> P2: Hmm.

> P2: so it told him, well, told me that the digital

> P2: good.

> P2: This digital Federal IP call is just for me.

> P2: But they did give me a a email address

> P2: to get my spouse. A medical id card. So

> P2: okay.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: So I

Thomas: with regards to this message, would you have any follow up questions? After reading this message.

> P2: I would.

Thomas: You said you would.

> P2: I would not.

Thomas: Not okay.

> P2: It. It gave me the information I needed. I just have to go keep the link they provided, and go from there and give my spouse id card. So.

Thomas: Okay, alright.

Thomas: So next, there's a message that was sent on September 12.th

Thomas: We're still staying on this page. So there's a message that was sent on September 12, th and I'd like you to find that message and let me know when you found it.

> P2: Okay?

> P2: Oh, got it? You want me to open it.

Thomas: Sure.

Thomas: I think it might already have been open. But

Thomas: okay.

> P2: What?

> P2: Oh.

> P2: yeah.

Thomas: So in the in this scenario. Who's who sent this question.

> P2: Well, I mean, since we're making this about me, it will be me. But I wasn't interested in stupid question.

Thomas: Okay.

> P2: You know, because of

> P2: it. It was pretty much self explanatory. But you know, to reciprocate an answer like that. Oh, well, you know if it's gonna be no, because they gave you the link to

> P2: get your spouse id card. So

> P2: you know, and I get it because I I work with a bunch of blind admits. So

> P2: you know, they they can be troublesome and

> P2: self-entitled, you know, like, okay. So

> P2: you know. So I did you know that question? But

> P2: I don't get that question. See what I'm saying? It's not. Oh, well.

> P2: my wife needs to get this car because I got this car, but if she has a military id, she has a military id. It shouldn't have to match your military id, you know. So

> P2: you know, because

> P2: so

> P2: not to jump in and throw things out, because, you know, we do adaptive sports. And we have blind people that have service animals.

> P2: and they're so fussy about their service animals. Well.

> P2: why can't I go skiing? And my dog can't go because your dog can't ski who's going to watch your dog, but you know it's that entitlement

> P2: issue.

> P2: That some veterans have, you know.

> P2: I get like I said. I get the question, but I really don't get the question, because it was kind of.

> P2: let's say simple question. You see what I'm saying, like, yeah.

> P2: some things did not

> P2: actually just cause you thought about it should come at you. Now, how about that?

> P2: Okay, so, yeah.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: that's that makes sense.

Thomas: So the

Thomas: But

Thomas: with with regards to this question, about getting the spouse a va card. Their response was that

Thomas: it's only available for veterans, and that they gave you kind of like a general link to go to va.gov

Thomas: so.

> P2: Right to get okay. So

> P2: if you ask the question, yeah, you say, Oh, this id is just for you.

> P2: He worked for you.

> P2: Why would you ask another question? Well, where will it be available for my wife? But they gave you a link.

> P2: or your wife? You see what I'm saying?

Thomas: Okay. Alright!

> P2: So alright.

Thomas: Alright.

Thomas: So let's say that. You would ask this question. Does that mean? At some point it will be available for spouses of veterans. Let's say that you've waited over a week. To getting a response from the the Va. Tell me what you would do next if you felt. You've waited long enough for them to reply back.

Thomas: Is there anything else on this page that would help you to do that?

> P2: You can send a reply.

> P2: you know I I'm I'm not trying to be redundant, but you know.

> P2: you know. Why would you be trying to

> P2: pursue something that was already answered, asked, did you see what I'm saying?

Thomas: Yeah, yeah.

> P2: You know that that's that's that's like,

> P2: it's like working full time and not being paid but once. You know what I'm saying just

> P2: it doesn't make sense. So anyway.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: so let's

Thomas: for hypothetical sake, on on this particular instance, that there was a question, that you that you had, and maybe the Va. Didn't give you all of the the necessary information. You would ask them a question, hoping to to getting a follow up, and you had to send a reply. They felt like you needed to, at least, maybe get one more bit of information

Thomas: to move forward and to let's say, if you you needed to send a reply in in this next section.

Thomas: what let's say, if you were just wanting to know if there was a website

Thomas: specifically

Thomas: for the Vic card

Thomas: that they can send.

Thomas: So how might you do that? Within this section.

> P2: I'm just alright.

> P2: Send a new message. Okay?

> P2: Look.

Thomas: And let's just go ahead and say that you put in a message. In there for that. A question.

> P2: Okay.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: how would you? How would you put in that that question?

> P2: Just hit this.

> P2: That's it. Yeah. Do. Do you want me to touch it? Or.

Thomas: Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, you can go and do that.

> P2: Oh, gee.

> P2: what was that? Id card? It would be.

Thomas: Yeah. Yeah. VIC,

Thomas: What would your next step be?

> P2: It's asked me.

> P2: It asked me, Do I got optional files? I want to upload. Okay?

> P2: Oh, wow, okay.

Thomas: Can you ever think of a time where you might need to upload a file.

> P2: Well.

Thomas: Yeah.

> P2: Say that again.

Thomas: I get

Thomas: can you think of there? If there would ever be a time that you might need to upload a file when you're asking a question.

> P2: Depending like, if you're doing disability and compensation.

> P2: if they're asking you for information that you have, like Dd, 214 or purpose.

> P2: denial letters or appeal letters. That you already have on your computer, or whatever. Actually, yeah, I could see you uploading and attaching those documents to send them in.

Thomas: Okay for this question, do you feel like you need to upload a file.

> P2: No. Okay.

> P2: Right?

Thomas: All right, let's go ahead and send this message. Then.

> P2: And I'll go. Okay.

Thomas: Okay. Now, before we kind of go through this page. I just want to. Let you know that. We're just gonna take a moment. Have you read through this? And then I just kinda wanna get your understanding of what

Thomas: is is on this page.

> P2: Okay.

> P2: England.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: So how was, you know, like in in terms of sending a reply back to the Va. How was that process for you?

> P2: That was very simple, and you know I I think

> P2: right after that it gives you the 800 number. So if you felt like you didn't get arrest.

> P2: They didn't get it. You have a number to directly call them back about okay.

> P2: yeah.

Thomas: What would be the next step? After replying back to the Va. Again? What do you? What do you think the next step would be.

> P2: Oh, waiting on a response. You got up to 7 days. So

> P2: It's pretty much a waiting area.

Thomas: Okay.

### Cool down

Thomas: so basically, at this, at this moment, [P2], we've gone through the all of the tasks that we wanted to look at today.

> P2: Well.

Thomas: Okay so if you if you want, you can stop sharing your screen. Now, if you'd like to.

> P2: Like that

> P2: alright.

Thomas: Great so we're gonna spend just some time here. Kind of reflecting upon the experience that you had with the dashboard and the and the question details overall 1st off. How was that for you?

> P2: That was pretty simple.

> P2: well, I'm a i'm a techie. So anyway, that was, you know, pretty simple to me. So.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: Now being a techie. And because you you've had looks like a a great deal of experience using voiceover, was there anything particularly challenging about, using voice over to find or review past questions.

> P2: No but what was the gentleman that just

> P2: show me through safari how to take my my thing off the screen, reader. Mode. Yeah, I didn't know that. So I I want to thank him for offering that a bit of information. So yeah.

Thomas: Thank you, Evan, for doing that.

> P2: Thanks Evan.

Thomas: Did you have any difficulty scrolling between the different questions on that 1st page.

Thomas: like losing like, what track? Of which question you were on at all?

> P2: Not really

> P2: I think I was scrolling real fast.

> P2: because I you know.

> P2: I kind of.

> P2: I guess speed-read a little bit So

> P2: I was kind of juggling the questions, trying to get

> P2: to the answer before reading the question, so I don't think so.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: how about replying to the Va. Any issues? With replying to the Va.

> P2: No, that was pretty simple.

> P2: the only thing that I think would probably be better like

> P2: the 7 days.

Thomas: You know that.

> P2: That's a whole week

> P2: if they can kind of break that down a little bit, you know.

> P2: But, like you said, there's the 800 number, so they can actually call and see if they get that action a little bit quicker. But yeah.

Thomas: Yeah.

Thomas: no, that makes sense.

Thomas: one of the things that. Because what what I really appreciated about today's test was you using the screen, reader in

Thomas: like checking the details that that link of checking details.

Thomas: Did that link provide kind of context information about what you were going to be getting. Can you talk to me a little bit about that link.

> P2: With that.

Thomas: So like when you were back on the on the dashboard, and you saw you had all of the the questions, and there was a link that said, check details. What? What information did your screen, reader, give you?

> P2: It. It gave me. So it was.

> P2: It was all the

> P2: the questions and answers

> P2: that pertain to that specific category. There was like,

> P2: It was like, if I asked the question.

> P2: You know, I had to click on the question to open the question.

> P2: And then I had to go to the response. Now I have to click and open the response. So it was categorized. Very well.

Thomas: Okay.

> P2: You know I liked it. The the the hide boxes, because it made it

> P2: that much

> P2: easier to read because it was, okay, cool, fine. I asked the question. They answer the question. I asked the question. They ask the question, so really don't have to go down the whole page. Okay, cool.

Thomas: Okay.

> P2: If I ask this question, is the response. And if I ask this question, this is the response. So lot easier to.

Thomas: Okay? So when you were on the question details page going through your question, Va's reply, your response.

Thomas: That was.

> P2: Like, what.

Thomas: Right? Okay, that's great to know. Alright.

Thomas: is there anything else that you have feedback for us, or anything that

Thomas: would help us to learn.

> P2: Like, I said, other than that time. Spot? No.

> P2: no, I I think this is a very productive meeting, and like I said, y'all gave some information. I gave some information, and I appreciate it, so.

Thomas: Okay, great. I was just gonna look back over to my colleagues, seeing if they had any additional questions at this moment. Looks like every everybody's good to go. [P2], I just want to thank you so much for the the feedback that you gave for us today was super helpful. And do you have any questions for me about ask Va. Or this research at all?

> P2: You know what?

> P2: question. So I got the Va app on my phone. So

> P2: I don't know if this on that app or do I have to go to actually the website? But.

Thomas: Yeah, this would be on the website. And currently, it's not live. What? What we've kind of gone through today is not currently live there is. The older version of Ask Va, which is, ask.va.gov.

> P2: Right. I've seen that correct.

Thomas: Yeah, so that that's just on the website this, this will all be within va.gov under contact. Us? But we're hoping, maybe before the end of this year that we get this the site updated and live.
