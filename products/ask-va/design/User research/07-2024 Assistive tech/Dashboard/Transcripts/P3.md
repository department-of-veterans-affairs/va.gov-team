### Warm up

Tyler: All right. So I've started the recording. And I just want to confirm if you're comfortable. If I record my screen and audio today.

> P3: Yes, I'm okay.

Tyler: All right. So that was a lot of information and a lot of different people. Do you have any questions before we start.

> P3: No.

> P3: Okay.

Tyler: Well, before we get into testing the website. I'd just love to learn a little bit more about you and your experience with the Va. how long have you been a veteran?

> P3: Since [around 1980] but I haven't used the Va. That long now.

Tyler: Yeah, when did you start interacting with the Va.

> P3: About 2,000. Well.

> P3: I did for a short period in the eighties, and then I started 99,

13
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:54.890
> P3: or too many.

14
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:55.210
Tyler: Okay.

15
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.540
> P3: I've been using the Va. For a long time.

16
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:04.040
Tyler: Yeah, in in 99. Did you go into a Va medical center to get set up with the Va. Or how'd you get.

17
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.179
> P3: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Everything was in person.

18
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:13.289
Tyler: Okay. And how has that changed? Or maybe not changed at all over the last 20 years?

19
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:21.809
> P3: It's changed a lot makes my life easier. I don't have to go into. Do everything in the office, you know. You can do it now

20
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:31.110
> P3: online. So I go to va.gov and change address, change this change that, or read this or download this. So yeah, life is a lot easier.

21
00:01:31.669 --> 00:01:38.120
Tyler: Okay, so it sounds like, you're pretty familiar with using va websites to get some of the stuff

22
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.136
Tyler: that you need to get done online.

23
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.830
Tyler: Do you use? Do you use the app?

24
00:01:45.630 --> 00:02:01.369
> P3: I use the Va app. I did use the my healthy vet, and now we've switched it to the Va app. va.gov and I, you know, on my phone and on my computer, too, I use the website on my computer. So.

25
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:15.350
Tyler: Okay? Gotcha, yeah, that sounds like a lot of different experiences. When you when you need to get something done. And you need to actually like talk to someone at the Va. How might you do that? What would you think to do first? st

26
00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.835
> P3: If it's a medical, I always send a message

27
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.650
> P3: messages

28
00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.189
> P3: on the on health.

29
00:02:26.755 --> 00:02:35.270
> P3: If it's anything benefits or anything like that you should try to find the email, or I will contact the local

30
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.689
> P3: eligibility office, and they will send me in the right direction.

31
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.240
Tyler: Okay.

32
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:46.079
Tyler: when you're looking for an email address for someone, let's say it's about benefits. How does that? How does that work.

33
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:47.729
> P3: It's a nightmare.

34
00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:52.400
> P3: So yeah, we don't have that you know

35
00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.310
> P3: where we could just go ask AI, hey, where's this? At.

36
00:02:57.585 --> 00:02:58.860
Tyler: Right?

37
00:02:59.238 --> 00:03:13.959
Tyler: But it sounds like your ideal scenario is to try and get in touch with someone, maybe more directly, like you're using my healthy bet to get in touch with your direct care team, or you want to get in touch with somebody directly using their email address. Is that right?

38
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:24.979
> P3: Yes, I'd rather do it all through online, because one of the big things is when you send it through email or on my message. Help it's documented.

39
00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:35.825
> P3: So I like things documented. So if I'm asking a question about medical cause, maybe I didn't grasp at all, you know, and so I need it then. I haven't come back in writing.

40
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.845
Tyler: Yeah, I can see how that's helpful.

41
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.850
Tyler: do you? Have you ever heard of? Ask? Va.

42
00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:53.990
> P3: Well, I've been hearing about that, and I've went on several times to try to find it, is it not? Is it there, or is it still? Just, I mean, because there's a lot of other

43
00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:03.379
> P3: websites that you use, you know it says ask or chat or something. And so I've been hearing about it. But I went on, and I can't find it.

44
00:04:04.135 --> 00:04:18.199
> P3: You know. So that's where I'm at, right there. With that I'd love to be able to use it because it would make life so much easier. I don't know if it's going to be a bot, I mean, like an AI, or if it's going to be real people out there, I haven't heard.

45
00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:21.289
Tyler: Okay, Gotcha. So

46
00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:34.149
Tyler: that's that's really helpful. So basically, you're looking for it. You don't know where it is. And it's not been easy to find, and it also sounds like it's not super clear what exactly it is, cause you're saying it could be like an AI. It could be a bot

47
00:04:34.394 --> 00:04:39.309
Tyler: what are you hoping it is? If it was like this really useful tool for you, how would that work?

48
00:04:40.145 --> 00:04:56.220
> P3: Well, I mean, I don't mind using the AI. I mean, I'm I'm for, you know, being visually impaired. Of course I'm all for AI, because it makes my life easier, because, you know, they'll ask you because it can send you to a document like right off. You can ask it something. And oh, yeah. And then you get it right back.

49
00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:02.009
> P3: Now, if you're talking to a person sometimes, they don't know things as well. So

50
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:17.259
> P3: it takes a while for them. They gotta, you know. Look at their computer, go research something. And then you're sitting there sitting there sitting there. And then they finally come back. So yeah, I'd love. I hope it starts out with AI, so I could just go like, Hey, I need form 10 something, you know, whatever.

51
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:32.687
Tyler: Right? Okay, that's helpful. So you would prefer to have the information more quickly. And if that means using AI or some other sort of like automated tool. You'd prefer that because you don't have to wait as long. Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense.

52
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:53.199
Tyler: that's really helpful background. And we're going to still continue to talk about this and your past experiences with the Va. But, I do want to ask you a couple of questions about using your assistive technology. So we talked about how you're using voice over on your phone. And then when you're on your computer, you use fusion. How long have you been using these tools?

53
00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.210
> P3: I'll say 5 or more years now.

54
00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:05.089
> P3: You know, I've used zoom text because we've you know, we've also advanced.

55
00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.870
> P3: We didn't have a lot of this So

56
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.320
> P3: we started out with zoom text, reader.

57
00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.579
> P3: and then zoom text because I could just zoom it in.

58
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.380
Tyler: And.

59
00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:23.689
> P3: And then switch over to Reader a little little then. Now they combine fusion with jaws, and so it's like

60
00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.970
> P3: way easier

61
00:06:25.398 --> 00:06:30.330
> P3: it. It is a big animal. So I'm still taking bites and learning it so.

62
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.545
> P3: But you can always Google, whatever you're doing, it'll tell you what to do.

63
00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:39.990
Tyler: Yeah, that that's helpful. So you've had experience with a lot of different

64
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:45.190
Tyler: tools. And like you said, the tools change. Things have progressed. Maybe

65
00:06:45.603 --> 00:06:56.419
Tyler: and there's a lot there's a lot of to learn about them. How often are you using screen readers or screen magnification when you're using a device.

66
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.739
> P3: I guess not a hundred percent of the time.

67
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:02.670
Tyler: Okay?

68
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:08.739
Tyler: And you use your your phone. And you said, you also use a like a desktop, computer,

69
00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:10.400
> P3: I use my laptop so.

70
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.659
Tyler: Okay, yeah.

71
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:13.410
Tyler: Awesome.

72
00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:16.150
> P3: And I have an ipad. But I'm usually I mean now, it's

73
00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:17.840
> P3: we just do everything on the phone.

74
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:19.960
Tyler: Yeah,

75
00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.324
Tyler: yeah, it's a blessing and a curse.

76
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.470
> P3: Right it is.

77
00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:26.670
Tyler: Do you have great.

78
00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:27.719
> P3: They screw it up.

79
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:29.530
> P3: down.

80
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:37.109
Tyler: Do you switch between using screen magnification and screen readers? Or are you mostly relying on screen readers these days?

81
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:47.379
> P3: I am. I mostly rely on screen readers. I can. I still have the ability to read like 2 letters at a time when it's white on black.

82
00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:52.910
> P3: Be the correct font. So you know. But that just kind of drains your what little vision you have.

83
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:58.180
> P3: So I it's just easier and a lot less stress to use the screen. Reader.

84
00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:08.049
Tyler: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Well, perfect. Evan, did you have any other questions about tech setup? Anything like that before we move on.

85
00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:20.949
Evan: I don't believe so. If you have any, you know issues or concerns with sharing your screen on your phone or mobile device that you're using. Let me know. I'll be happy to jump in.

86
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:22.170
> P3: Okay.

87
00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:23.410
Tyler: Thanks, Evan

88
00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.940
Tyler: and [P3]. What browser do you usually use on your phone?

89
00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:33.590
> P3: On my phone. I have safari. But I also have Google on here. But I usually it's most of the time. Safari.

90
00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:34.740
> P3: Okay.

91
00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:42.650
Tyler: Okay, awesome. And I know you've done research with the Va. Before. Have you shared your screen? On zoom before.

92
00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:45.279
> P3: Oh, yeah, yeah, that's no problem.

93
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.279
Tyler: All right. Well, I'll I'm gonna give you a minute to do that, and if you need any help, you just let us know.

94
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.100
> P3: Okay.

95
00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:57.169
> P3: Now, you want to send me a link and what I think. But oh, maybe that was this on the computer.

96
00:08:57.877 --> 00:09:05.940
Tyler: I will send you a link. I was gonna send it after you screen share just in case you hit any trouble sharing your screen. But do you prefer I send it now.

97
00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:10.440
> P3: I think that's how we've done it in the past is able to

98
00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:16.970
Tyler: Yeah, that totally works. I'm gonna send it on the on the chat on zoom. Does that work for you?

99
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.179
> P3: Yeah, I can find, too.

100
00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.499
Tyler: Oh, wait! That one didn't work.

101
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.539
Tyler: You can ignore that one.

102
00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:26.610
Tyler: Yeah.

103
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:37.060
Tyler: all right. I just sent you a link, and I'm going to be quiet while you're using your screen, reader, for a minute.

104
00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:47.660
Tyler: Huh!

105
00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:48.920
> P3: Not long.

106
00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:02.170
> P3: huh?

107
00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:05.340
> P3: Might need to get Evan on there.

108
00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:12.099
Evan: Alright! What's going on are you? Are you seeing the the link in the chat?

109
00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.179
> P3: Well, I can't even get

110
00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.149
> P3: the chat's not coming up.

111
00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:17.790
Evan: Really.

112
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:18.629
> P3: Here we go.

113
00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:20.569
> P3: I think I just got it.

114
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:23.890
> P3: Sorry.

115
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.119
Tyler: [P3]. I don't want to interrupt your.

116
00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.140
> P3: Yeah. Go ahead.

117
00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:53.899
Tyler: If it's easier. What we can do is navigate to share your screen, and then that way we can help you find the chat.

118
00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.390
> P3: I well, I had the chat. I went.

119
00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:58.400
Tyler: Got the chat.

120
00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:01.270
> P3: And I'm at ask,

121
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.409
> P3: yeah. Sba.

122
00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:06.190
Tyler: Okay, perfect. Okay?

123
00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:09.769
Tyler: So then, yeah, if you just come back to Zoom, you'll be able to

124
00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:11.809
Tyler: share your screen. Now.

125
00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:23.080
> P3: Oops.

126
00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:32.710
> P3: Yes.

127
00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:36.389
> P3: Doesn't show.

128
00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:40.350
> P3: Wow!

129
00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.360
Evan: You doing? Okay? [P3].

130
00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.630
> P3: I'm working on him. Okay, we're share. Let's see.

131
00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:01.459
> P3: There we go.

132
00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:14.639
Tyler: So we're not seeing anything yet.

133
00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:19.409
Tyler: Oh, there we go!

134
00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:23.720
> P3: Okay, so.

135
00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.959
Tyler: Yeah, that's perfect. Awesome. So

136
00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:32.150
Tyler: it looks like, now you're on zoom perfect, and you're navigating back.

137
00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.010
> P3: Yeah.

138
00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:34.640
Tyler: Awesome.

139
00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:36.770
Tyler: All right.

140
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:43.370
Tyler: so now we're all set up. This is the website that we're going to be looking at together today.

141
00:12:44.017 --> 00:12:52.009
Tyler: Like, I said. If I interrupt your screen, reader, or vice versa. You just let me know, because I can't actually hear the screen, reader.

142
00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:52.800
> P3: Okay.

143
00:12:53.333 --> 00:13:07.560
Tyler: So now that we're on this page, what we're gonna do is navigate down to where it says research study. So there's going to be a heading that says research study. And then under that it's going to be a sign in button. And if you can just click on that sign in Link.

144
00:13:07.817 --> 00:13:09.639
Tyler: I'll give you a minute to do that.

145
00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:10.340
> P3: Okay.

146
00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:20.710
> P3: okay, we're sign in login.gov, or.

147
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:24.270
Tyler: Okay? So that's actually a different sign in button. And that's.

148
00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:25.050
> P3: Tenfold, yeah.

149
00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:25.470
Tyler: So

150
00:13:26.407 --> 00:13:32.160
Tyler: hopefully, you're able to navigate up and close this. Yeah, or you can click back. I think that should work.

151
00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:38.509
Tyler: Okay, perfect. So now we're at the ask Va. Heading, and if you navigate down the page.

152
00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:39.300
> P3: Okay.

153
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:55.769
Tyler: And we'll keep going past this sign in.

154
00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:56.480
> P3: Okay.

155
00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:05.190
> P3: Fair.

156
00:14:06.304 --> 00:14:11.330
Tyler: So keep going. This is a little funny because it's set up for the research study.

157
00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:12.270
> P3: Okay, guys.

158
00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:18.400
Tyler: Okay. Perfect.

159
00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:20.910
Tyler: Awesome.

160
00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:21.630
> P3: Okay.

161
00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:23.469
Tyler: Alright, so

162
00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:27.510
Tyler: Hopefully it's silent on your end now.

### Dashboard

Tyler: Okay, great. So we're all set up now. I'm going to tell you a little bit about this page before we get started. So this is a tool called Ask Va, we started talking about it a little earlier. It's a way for veterans to contact the Va and ask a question online.

164
00:14:44.395 --> 00:15:03.099
Tyler: for today's session. We're gonna pretend, like you've recently asked the Va a question through this tool. And now you've signed into your account. So you're in your account on Vagov. Because you're hoping to read a reply to your question. Okay? So

165
00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:23.660
Tyler: we're gonna go through a couple of different tasks, which I'll explain as we go. But the important thing here is we want to understand what's going through your mind as you navigate. And as your assistive technology is supporting you, so if, like a heading is confusing or a link is not like making sense. Those are all things that are really helpful for us to understand.

166
00:15:23.939 --> 00:15:35.939
Tyler: While you're focused on a task, I'm gonna try and be quiet, and it's helpful if you pause, and you kind of let me know when you're when you're ready to start talking again. Do you have any questions for me?

167
00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:36.910
> P3: No.

168
00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:46.179
Tyler: Okay, awesome. So we'll get started. Again. Like I said, instead of making you sign in today, we're gonna pretend like you've signed in, and you're in your account.

169
00:15:46.458 --> 00:15:58.390
Tyler: And so you've arrived at this page, and the 1st thing I'd like you to do is orient yourself on the page. So I'm going to give you a couple of minutes to navigate around. And after you finish I just want you to explain this page to me.

170
00:18:58.630 --> 00:18:59.600
> P3: Okay.

171
00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:06.989
Tyler: Alright, so it looks like you went through the the entirety of the page. So tell me what's what information is on this page.

172
00:19:08.326 --> 00:19:12.459
> P3: It looks like that you can submit.

173
00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:19.529
> P3: I mean, it's got the information telling you what ask Va is about, and then where you can

174
00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:27.289
> P3: submit a question, and also, and then it gives you a list of questions, and

175
00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:30.009
> P3: that you have previously submitted.

176
00:19:30.929 --> 00:19:31.529
Tyler: Okay.

177
00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:38.269
> P3: And of course you know at the bottom all the details about who contact and all of that, and that dreaded number. Everybody hates.

178
00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:58.789
Tyler: Yeah, okay, awesome. So it tells you about what this tool is. It lets you ask a question, and it also has your previous questions on the page. That's really helpful. As you navigated through. This page, and particularly through the previous questions, did you find anything confusing.

179
00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:17.619
> P3: I guess when I've got down to the questions I was trying to figure out, there were the answers. And okay, you know, is, do we? Can I delete these? Do these stay here automatically, is there? Edit? Is there?

180
00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:23.479
> P3: Reply. All of this stuff? Yeah, I didn't go into all of it didn't include any

181
00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:24.889
> P3: anything, sir.

182
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:38.600
Tyler: okay, that makes sense. So you notice that the questions are on this page and so automatically, you're, like okay, where's the answer, but you also haven't clicked, clicked anything yet. Yeah. Did you notice any links on this page?

183
00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:47.789
> P3: I didn't hear a signal, come to think which I did go through. It kind of fast. As I said, I didn't linger on the things, but.

184
00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:49.850
Tyler: Let's see.

185
00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:50.919
> P3: Hold on! Just a second.

186
00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:51.710
Tyler: Okay.

187
00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:57.819
> P3: There. We got a link there on asking you questions, so that should take me to where I can.

188
00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:00.679
> P3: I'm assuming a form.

189
00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:04.069
> P3: That I can type in my question and send.

190
00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:07.849
> P3: So they're probably same thing with the

191
00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:08.620
> P3: see.

192
00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:10.170
> P3: No.

193
00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:11.560
> P3: I see

194
00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:18.239
> P3: this has a button, so it must tell me what kind of questions that you can ask.

195
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:23.220
> P3: Okay.

196
00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:43.520
> P3: okay.

197
00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:46.869
> P3: so that was a link.

198
00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:50.610
> P3: added ...

199
00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:53.590
> P3: Let's go back to this.

200
00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:08.980
> P3: Right? Listen.

201
00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:15.290
> P3: I'm thinking of

202
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:17.390
> P3: people

203
00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:20.039
> P3: other people that use

204
00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:22.290
> P3: va.gov, and

205
00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:24.529
> P3: and some of their struggles, too.

206
00:22:25.094 --> 00:22:27.940
> P3: So when we get here to

207
00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.020
> P3: it, just says.

208
00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:34.611
> P3: Yeah, I mean it. It does, thank goodness, it says

209
00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:39.639
> P3: double tap to expand. That's a lot of them, don't it? Just says Button.

210
00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:43.380
> P3: So that's good that you put that in there, so we'll go down.

211
00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:01.969
> P3: So you do have a way to go back to an older

212
00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:06.749
> P3: question that you've had. So you don't have to just keep going through messages.

213
00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.640
> P3: That's a good thing that's really good.

214
00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:09.470
Tyler: Yeah.

215
00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:10.800
Tyler: So [P3]

216
00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:28.309
Tyler: I'm gonna I'm gonna propose another task. So same as you're doing right now, just going through the page telling me what you're doing. It's perfect. So there's a couple of questions on this page that you've already asked right? And I want you to find a question that has a reply from the Va.

217
00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:32.389
Tyler: So you can navigate around and tell me what you're finding as you go.

218
00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.539
> P3: Okay, that's good. Then.

219
00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:18.633
Tyler: So, [P3], when you have a moment.

220
00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:23.790
Tyler: Okay, so tell me what you've just what you just did walk me through that.

221
00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:31.579
> P3: Well, I didn't really know what it was going to do for me, so I just clicked on it. I'm 1 that will click, because I'm curious.

222
00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:35.559
> P3: it was kind of a guessing thing.

223
00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:38.250
> P3: For me, because I you know.

224
00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:41.340
> P3: a lot of screen readers would kind of fly through these.

225
00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:48.689
> P3: so I just wanted to see, you know. Okay, is there more information under? This is just. But

226
00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:51.360
> P3: instead of what was a little

227
00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:55.049
> P3: whip that you had on the 1st page on it.

228
00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:55.400
Tyler: Okay.

229
00:24:55.400 --> 00:25:05.290
> P3: I wanted to find out more. So that's the question details. I didn't know if it was just going to take me to a screen and say, Hey, here's what you wrote, you know. Blah blah.

230
00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:06.050
Tyler: Yeah.

231
00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:16.300
> P3: Is it? Says Progress. So that's good that it I mean it said it in on the other page. But for me, I would want to find out more, you know. Has anyone looked at this? You know it's it's still

232
00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:24.019
> P3: just hanging out there, I mean, because you look at the dates. How many? How long has it been since I submitted? This does

233
00:25:24.884 --> 00:25:29.440
> P3: when you worked with the Va. You know things get lost.

234
00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:30.290
Tyler: Okay.

235
00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.590
> P3: So

236
00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:35.915
> P3: I would definitely want this more details.

237
00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:37.140
Tyler: Yeah.

238
00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:48.319
Tyler: this is really helpful. So you're kind of saying that although this ended up having kind of the same information that was on the last page. You weren't really sure

239
00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:57.993
Tyler: you kind of wanted some more details, and you felt like you were guessing a little bit. And so we went into this link to see what we would find which was really helpful.

240
00:25:58.310 --> 00:26:14.440
Tyler: let's let's navigate back. We're gonna come back to this page in a little bit. But let's go back to the page we were just on. Unfortunately, I think we're gonna have to go all the way back to the 1st page. So if you just click the back button, or you can even navigate up. Yeah, right there

241
00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:22.550
Tyler: and then. Now we're back on this 1st page. So you'll navigate down to the second sign in button.

242
00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:31.500
Tyler: Perfect.

243
00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:34.360
Tyler: Okay.

244
00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:35.950
Tyler: so we're back here.

245
00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:42.260
Tyler: And that that question was for you to find a question that has a reply from the Va.

246
00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:48.139
Tyler: And we went into the the details to try and figure out if that would help us

247
00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:54.830
Tyler: just staying on this page. Now, can you tell me if there's anything on this page that would let you know if there's a reply from the Va.

248
00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:58.120
> P3: I will find out.

249
00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:19.300
> P3: Reopen.

250
00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:38.800
> P3: Oh.

251
00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:48.279
> P3: I would not know what reopen is.

252
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:51.109
> P3: Thing I've ever seen on the

253
00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:54.060
> P3: I mean, that would be a case. But.

254
00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:55.330
Tyler: Okay.

255
00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:58.560
> P3: I wouldn't know asking a question.

256
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:59.930
> P3: Okay, just

257
00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:01.610
> P3: just saying that. Okay.

258
00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:03.110
Tyler: No, that's helpful.

259
00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:09.900
> P3: Okay.

260
00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:42.010
Tyler: So let's pause here for a minute.

261
00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:42.900
> P3: Yeah.

262
00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:44.960
> P3: Oh, okay, go ahead.

263
00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:46.130
Tyler: So

264
00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:55.489
Tyler: we're, you know, the task is for you to find a question that has a reply. And I'm kind of getting this sense that it's not that simple to figure out which questions have a reply.

265
00:28:56.010 --> 00:28:56.630
> P3: No.

266
00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:57.550
Tyler: Okay.

267
00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:15.053
> P3: No, I think the reply should be at the top. I think that's my opinion, because I mean, that's how yeah, we we should have a way to be able to click, you know all replies, or instead of just kind of moving ourselves around in here, I feel like I'm

268
00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:19.589
> P3: spending a lot of time that I shouldn't have to be spending.

269
00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:21.370
Tyler: Yes, you know. Yeah. So.

270
00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:25.020
> P3: To see if you've if it has. And then that

271
00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:32.400
> P3: reopened. I know a lot of veterans would like reopen. Oh, my gosh! They are reopening my claim, or case, or what.

272
00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:32.839
Tyler: That's fine!

273
00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:36.039
> P3: I could see that happening a lot sorry. But that's I don't.

274
00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:40.654
> P3: Veterans react. I work in the Va, so I know how they react. So.

275
00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:42.609
Tyler: No, that's really helpful. So.

276
00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:43.030
> P3: That's.

277
00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:49.640
Tyler: There's a couple of things you're there's a couple of things you're noticing. One is just the language like reopened.

278
00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:49.980
> P3: So.

279
00:29:49.980 --> 00:30:02.149
Tyler: Clear. And you associate that with a case. One of the things you noticed is like you're having to kind of like dig and jump around to try and figure out if there's a reply. I'm curious. If.

280
00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:17.820
Tyler: because you said like, I would expect the the reply to be at the top. I'm curious if you're expecting it, to say something like you have a reply, or if you're expecting it, to say what the actual reply is from the Va.

281
00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:29.340
> P3: Well to me, because sometimes you might get a double reply, you know, might get a reply, because you're if you're asking different questions, you know, especially if you're a new veteran and you're asking different questions. You might have multiple questions. So if it said.

282
00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:31.240
> P3: you have

283
00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:37.150
> P3: 2 replies, click here and it'll take you to the 1st one. Then it'll take you to the second one.

284
00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:41.789
> P3: You know, I mean, then you can click on. I mean, it would list, you know.

285
00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:42.140
Tyler: Okay.

286
00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:46.230
> P3: Blah blah reply, blah blah! And you just click on those, and then then you're done.

287
00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:47.010
Tyler: Gotcha.

288
00:30:47.298 --> 00:30:55.669
> P3: But here I got to go all the way through all of this, just to find a reply, and then I listen to the in progress, you know, reopen.

289
00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:56.930
Tyler: Yeah.

290
00:30:56.930 --> 00:31:01.820
> P3: I think I should have a better way of just click finding this stuff.

291
00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:10.469
Tyler: Yeah, I can totally understand that. So we talked about the reopened status being a bit confusing. What does in progress mean?

292
00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:20.279
> P3: In progress. I mean, I would assume that, you know, we're still waiting for somebody to answer it. But okay, so if it's in progress.

293
00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.310
> P3: and it's been a month.

294
00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:24.329
> P3: Do I resubmit it?

295
00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:30.550
> P3: I'm at this like I said. We're dealing with the Va. We're dealing with a big animal, and it's like.

296
00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.089
> P3: Oh, okay, in progress.

297
00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:39.350
> P3: How long, or I mean, I don't know how they're gonna set this up, like.

298
00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:47.749
> P3: you know, with the when you message your medical facility. I mean, you know, they have so many days to.

299
00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:52.219
> P3: I mean, they've added more days to it used to be like 24 h, but it used to be awful

300
00:31:52.250 --> 00:32:00.439
> P3: because nobody can. You just have too many cases. But if it says, you know, if you've not with heard from us within

301
00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:08.860
> P3: 7 business days or 10 business days. Please resubmit. So I don't know I didn't see anything like that.

302
00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:10.420
Tyler: Yeah. Okay.

303
00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:11.480
Tyler: So

304
00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:21.229
Tyler: reopened, we don't like. And even in progress is not great. If it's not clear whether, like I need to do something because it's in progress.

305
00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:33.439
Tyler: what I'd like to do now. We're back in this details, Page. I want to go back to the page we were just on which, unfortunately, like you did before you're going to go all the way to the start. So I'll give you a moment to do that.

306
00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:34.380
> P3: Why?

307
00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:05.200
Tyler: Yes.

308
00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:06.929
Tyler: yeah. Perfect.

309
00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:14.330
> P3: Oops.

310
00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:17.660
> P3: Oh.

311
00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:21.849
> P3: oh, I went and signed Dan. Sorry. That's okay. We go back.

312
00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:25.309
Tyler: Yeah, if you exit this, I think you just need to.

313
00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:28.200
> P3: I think I just went back before.

314
00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:37.900
> P3: Listen for research.

315
00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:48.100
Tyler: Yeah, perfect.

316
00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:52.470
Tyler: Okay, awesome. So we're back here.

317
00:33:54.113 --> 00:33:56.729
Tyler: Sorry about the jump around.

318
00:33:58.050 --> 00:34:08.339
Tyler: and we've talked about how it's not clear which questions have a reply. The next thing I'd like you to try and do is find a question that's related to home loans.

319
00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:13.030
Tyler: And so as you're navigating before you

320
00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:19.870
Tyler: click on a link or a button just let me know, and we can chat about it before you click on it. Okay.

321
00:34:19.870 --> 00:34:20.520
> P3: Okay.

322
00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:15.240
> P3: I didn't find one.

323
00:35:15.690 --> 00:35:19.290
Tyler: Okay, yeah, that makes sense. And what were you listening for?

324
00:35:20.732 --> 00:35:22.000
> P3: In the category.

325
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.210
Tyler: Okay, you're listening for the cat.

326
00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:33.519
> P3: So, yeah, and that's something that you know. You have 2 replies, and then you click. 2 replies. It says, replied, and if it would say the category on the other side of it. Wow! That would say a lot of time.

327
00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:37.710
Tyler: So in the sense that let me make sure I'm understanding. So.

328
00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:38.160
> P3: Okay.

329
00:35:38.445 --> 00:35:42.439
Tyler: It's saying, replied. And then, if it said the category right after that that.

330
00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:43.340
> P3: Right.

331
00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:46.049
Tyler: Yeah. So that's because you're jumping down. Yeah.

332
00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:48.780
> P3: Yeah, because I mean with the screen, reader, you you know

333
00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:52.239
> P3: I mean some of them go really fast, I mean, but

334
00:35:52.500 --> 00:36:07.510
> P3: I mean, you're trying to get through here. You're trying, especially if you need to know something. Now, if you're like the id thing. Okay, I have to get this id this week, you know. Okay, where's my reply? Where's my reply? But if it just said at the top.

335
00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:10.309
> P3: you know, replies, and then

336
00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:14.299
> P3: reply, One category, oh, to me it would be like

337
00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:15.880
> P3: you just saved me

338
00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:19.589
> P3: a lot of time. I wouldn't have to go scrolling all through those.

339
00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:26.989
Tyler: yeah, that makes sense. And what what element on the page are you currently on right? Now.

340
00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:32.669
> P3: we're at page 2.

341
00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:33.410
Tyler: Okay.

342
00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:37.389
Tyler: And when you say that, are we on page 2, are we on page one.

343
00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:38.250
> P3: Items

344
00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:43.590
> P3: that's current. Page page one is for. So where we have another page.

345
00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:44.270
Tyler: Okay.

346
00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:45.640
> P3: Yeah.

347
00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:47.149
> P3: let's go ahead and.

348
00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:48.730
Tyler: Yeah, let's try that.

349
00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:58.720
Tyler: And [P3].

350
00:36:59.100 --> 00:36:59.700
> P3: Huh!

351
00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:09.999
Tyler: This is, I should have warned you before this happened. But this is an issue that we're aware of. Where, when you clicked on page 2. It dropped you all the way down to the footer of the page.

352
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:10.969
> P3: Oh, okay.

353
00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:17.270
Tyler: So if you I think, swipe up you'll end up back at the bulk of the page. Yeah, there you go.

354
00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:19.490
> P3: Oh, yeah.

355
00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:20.400
Tyler: Oh.

356
00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:25.169
Tyler: yeah, I think you should be. Oh, oh, no.

357
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:34.449
Tyler: that's not. That's not your fault. That's I think. The page reloaded. And now we're kicked out.

358
00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:36.560
> P3: Okay.

359
00:37:43.930 --> 00:37:45.000
> P3: research.

360
00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:54.090
> P3: Perfect.

361
00:37:54.340 --> 00:38:05.699
Tyler: Alright sorry about that. So let's try and find ourselves on page 2 one more time. And what's gonna happen is you're gonna drop down to the footer, and you'll just have to navigate back up.

362
00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:07.140
> P3: Back. Up. Okay.

363
00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:28.440
Tyler: Perfect.

364
00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:31.390
Tyler: Okay.

365
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:37.569
> P3: Do you want me to go find it?

366
00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:39.760
> P3: Question.

367
00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:51.609
Tyler: No, you're good. So now, we're on page 2, and I just want you to have a look at the questions on this page. Can you navigate to where the questions are on this page?

368
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:05.499
> P3: Okay. We got the home lawns.

369
00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:06.290
Tyler: Okay?

370
00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:23.839
Tyler: So obviously, that was a little bit of a process. So so, is there any other way that we could have found a question about home loans, and maybe there's not. But I'm curious. If there's any other way we could have found a question about home loans.

371
00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:34.209
> P3: Well, a lot of times you go to the menu and it'll tell you the home loans so. I don't. You know. If it was a reply, and it was in reapply thing.

372
00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:35.190
> P3: I

373
00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:42.459
> P3: I mean cause. Basically, I had to go through

374
00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:44.370
> P3: all this up here.

375
00:39:44.970 --> 00:39:50.379
> P3: all this Assier. And all this answer this, all this answer, this. Okay, where is this question?

376
00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:53.399
> P3: Here we go. Finally questions.

377
00:39:55.069 --> 00:39:55.769
> P3: Yeah.

378
00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:56.630
Tyler: Yeah. Totally.

379
00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:57.355
> P3: This.

380
00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:02.444
Tyler: So what and what comes after your questions? What comes after that? Heading.

381
00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:07.550
> P3: Is this telling me when it's update? Is that what you're talking about? Or let me?

382
00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:09.730
> P3: Let's see.

383
00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:19.210
> P3: So this has reply. So it should have been at the very. I would even have to go rushing over here tracking this down if you had it up there at the top.

384
00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:23.339
> P3: You would have just saved me a lot of time.

385
00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:38.630
> P3: Yeah, but you're gonna have some people, and you gotta remember you're dealing with all ages. So you're gonna have some older beds because everybody's finding out. Now, you're always, always gonna have your people that have to talk to somebody that cannot do technology.

386
00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:45.139
> P3: But the blind rehabs really push technology. You know, that's what they train all of us in technology.

387
00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:53.330
> P3: So even your older veterans, you know, they teach them on the computer. Most of them use it on the computer.

388
00:40:53.720 --> 00:41:04.240
> P3: I'm I'm older, too. But I'm I still of technology. But I'm not. I mean, we have some that are 80 and 90 years old, and some of them are just amazing at technology.

389
00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:07.640
> P3: But then some of them aren't. But they want to be able to. And

390
00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:12.140
> P3: you know, if you've ever called that 1 800 number. You're very frustrated.

391
00:41:12.330 --> 00:41:14.786
> P3: cause nobody ever answers.

392
00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:22.909
> P3: you know, and then you're sent from here to here. Well, you know, and it's frustrating so that life would be much easier if we just asked them a question.

393
00:41:25.010 --> 00:41:27.699
> P3: And but I think there needs to be.

394
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:31.830
> P3: I think the Va. Needs to put a timestamp on this.

395
00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:33.200
Tyler: Okay.

396
00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:40.119
> P3: They don't need to let it, because some questions like I said, can get lost out here. And

397
00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:43.589
> P3: you know, Internet land.

398
00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:44.680
Tyler: Yeah.

399
00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:49.539
> P3: Would have been great. Yeah, I mean, if

400
00:41:50.570 --> 00:42:01.359
> P3: I mean, I don't know. I mean right? I mean, I I really think you need to have something at the beginning, so we don't have to sit here and go through every one of these questions to find out if it's been replied or in progress, or.

401
00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:02.540
Tyler: Right.

402
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:06.860
Tyler: So let me make sure I'm understanding everything. So

403
00:42:07.807 --> 00:42:19.009
Tyler: and I totally hear you on all the like. The kind of past experience with Va. And not getting a reply on time, and everything is all bubbling to the surface for you as it would for other veterans.

404
00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:19.560
> P3: Yeah.

405
00:42:19.835 --> 00:42:28.360
Tyler: And I wanna make sure I'm understanding now, when you are on this label that Says replied. And you're saying like this would have been good to have at the beginning.

406
00:42:28.811 --> 00:42:34.559
Tyler: Is this the sort of thing you were looking for earlier when I asked you to find a question with a reply.

407
00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:35.590
Tyler: Yeah, something.

408
00:42:35.590 --> 00:42:36.139
> P3: I thought it was.

409
00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:36.510
Tyler: Okay.

410
00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:39.229
> P3: Up and say, you know you have blank reply.

411
00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:43.570
> P3: you know, if you click on that

412
00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:45.460
> P3: click here to

413
00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:49.540
> P3: for replies and then click on the correct one.

414
00:42:49.995 --> 00:42:50.450
Tyler: Yeah.

415
00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:53.959
> P3: I mean, it would have been so much easier at the very beginning.

416
00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:56.119
Tyler: Yeah, for sure

417
00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:59.630
Tyler: I can. I can totally understand that.

418
00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:11.519
> P3: I mean, we like things faster, I mean, that's the thing. And well, that's and you know, I mean, that's my pet peeve with things when you have to go through so many websites. Just to get to one thing.

419
00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:22.120
Tyler: Yeah, no. I, I hear you and obviously, you know, I'm observing you do this so I can see how it feels a bit like silly how long it's taking

420
00:43:22.881 --> 00:43:38.780
Tyler: and so I totally get that I want to talk about something that we haven't talked about very much yet. That's on on this page. So why don't we? Why don't we navigate back to the 1st page? Of questions? So let's do that first.st

421
00:43:39.330 --> 00:43:40.650
> P3: See if it'll take me back.

422
00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:50.149
Tyler: Okay, perfect.

423
00:43:51.985 --> 00:43:57.760
Tyler: So now we're on this page, and I want to talk about some of the filters that are on this page.

424
00:43:58.197 --> 00:44:00.909
Tyler: So can you navigate to the filters?

425
00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:14.579
Tyler: Okay. Awesome. So what? What are the different options for ways that you can organize your questions? Can you tell me what those are.

426
00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:16.450
> P3: It's got it quicker.

427
00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:33.313
> P3: So I guess it's letting you. You have to go to here to

428
00:44:35.470 --> 00:44:42.670
> P3: Okay, I can go to that question which I would when I saw filters, I would thought, Huh, filter, okay.

429
00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:44.771
> P3: this is how I apply

430
00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:48.629
Tyler: Yeah, when you.

431
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:51.219
Tyler: when you heard the word filter, what did you think.

432
00:44:54.760 --> 00:45:00.290
> P3: that those categories, I guess, were filtered, you know, because it has. The Va has all these different categories.

433
00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:04.759
> P3: And I don't. I don't know. I don't know why it threw me off, but

434
00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:07.429
> P3: I mean I'll eventually figure it out and play with it.

435
00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:10.799
Tyler: Yeah, totally. Okay. So

436
00:45:10.830 --> 00:45:14.279
Tyler: this is a way for you to filter by different categories.

437
00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:15.000
> P3: Rice.

438
00:45:15.615 --> 00:45:22.320
Tyler: Okay, perfect. That that makes sense. And then if we just navigate out of this filter, can you tell me.

439
00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:22.790
> P3: It's.

440
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:24.589
Tyler: Any other way? Yeah.

441
00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:30.820
> P3: Okay. It says it just gives me the filter, but I don't know if that's been replied or

442
00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:32.559
> P3: okay with me.

443
00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:43.930
Tyler: Yes, got it. So although you can like highlight sign in and technical issues questions, you won't know if there's reply questions or not okay, Gotcha.

444
00:45:44.130 --> 00:45:46.149
Tyler: Is there any other way to organize

445
00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:49.130
Tyler: or questions besides doing that by category?

446
00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:58.709
> P3: I mean in progress, and then replied.

447
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:05.600
> P3: If we're looking for questions that I submitted. So I've submitted several different questions.

448
00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:09.220
> P3: Okay, what do they reply to what is in progress?

449
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:14.529
> P3: I mean, I don't know how many categories the Va. Is going to have.

450
00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:17.849
> P3: And so.

451
00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:19.340
> P3: yeah, we

452
00:46:19.788 --> 00:46:22.300
> P3: I don't know. This kind of destroys me. I don't know.

453
00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:23.000
Tyler: Yeah.

454
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:31.186
> P3: I gotta think about this with this one just like filters. Yeah, I mean, I use filters on a lot of stuff. But usually it's newest, oldest

455
00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:37.860
> P3: You know, or your replies, or.

456
00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:41.300
> P3: Things like that. I'm just trying to think of some that's

457
00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:49.660
> P3: listed all these different categories. So so it's got all these different categories which is cool. If you

458
00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:57.559
> P3: say maybe a year ago I see any other question, it's still there. I want to go back and reread it, you know. That would be cool.

459
00:46:58.110 --> 00:47:01.079
> P3: That would be good. Sorry would be good.

460
00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:06.809
> P3: I'm still going back to those replies, though I don't want to have to do all this stuff.

461
00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:27.440
Tyler: For sure, that makes sense. So the filter by category, there's something about it that's kind of like throwing you off. And maybe it's because it's it's not a common filter like you wouldn't go on any old website, and it might say filter by category. But you did mention like newest to oldest, and using things like that like a way of sorting

462
00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:28.460
Tyler: cards.

463
00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:35.710
Tyler: Is there any way to sort the cards by newest to oldest or oldest to newest on this page.

464
00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:37.190
> P3: I think I heard it

465
00:47:38.170 --> 00:47:40.540
> P3: the last updated you as to hold us the secrets.

466
00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:43.600
> P3: So yeah, I could go here

467
00:47:45.090 --> 00:47:47.610
> P3: and then have the oldest ones put in there.

468
00:47:47.610 --> 00:47:48.320
Tyler: Okay.

469
00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:49.910
Tyler: So now

470
00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:52.669
Tyler: it's gonna change the order of the questions.

471
00:47:53.015 --> 00:47:55.089
> P3: So it should have the loans.

472
00:47:55.130 --> 00:47:56.440
> P3: Let's see if it does

473
00:47:59.150 --> 00:48:03.830
> P3: right there. So that's the last one or the 1st one that I would have sent in so.

474
00:48:03.830 --> 00:48:04.200
Tyler: Okay.

475
00:48:04.591 --> 00:48:06.159
> P3: That would be useful.

476
00:48:06.727 --> 00:48:12.629
> P3: If I want to go back, you know. Say, oh, I submitted this a long time ago.

477
00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:13.840
> P3: maybe

478
00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:18.729
> P3: date months. I don't know. Dates year. I don't know business.

479
00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:29.560
> P3: Here we go.

480
00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:36.490
> P3: So

481
00:48:37.490 --> 00:48:38.750
> P3: what's about the Zoo?

482
00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:51.060
> P3: Oh, just go ahead. Have some training

483
00:48:52.570 --> 00:48:56.700
> P3: to stop and play with everything you got it in there. It's just not that.

484
00:48:57.050 --> 00:49:01.970
Tyler: Yeah, well, that's that's why we wanna do things like this. Because it's

485
00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:05.507
Tyler: obviously we think about this a lot because it's our job.

486
00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:06.680
> P3: Yeah.

487
00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:27.606
Tyler: And it's it's not as obvious, like, what things other people are going to notice, or what things aren't gonna work well for people, and what I feel like I'm I'm noticing is what you really wanted through a lot of the questions I was asking you was to have a way of figuring out which questions how to reply and which questions didn't. And that wasn't obvious enough.

488
00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:42.840
Tyler: and that's not a problem with you. That's a problem with the website. So do you think that you know there's a there's a few options here. There's like sorting by oldest to newest. There's sorting by category. There's this filtering by status.

489
00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:47.769
Tyler: How do you feel about those 3 options?

490
00:49:47.770 --> 00:49:57.630
> P3: Well, I mean they are. They're all good options. You know, the oldest to the newest, the newest it's, you know, is that the newest reply. Or is that just the newest

491
00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:13.279
> P3: I mean, I know I would. Once I figured it out I would be using the

492
00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:29.749
> P3: you know filter by status. Also, I don't know. With the, with the met with the medical like. If you send a message to your doctor, we get an email. And so, you know, there's been a reply.

493
00:50:31.090 --> 00:50:41.359
> P3: So you get. I mean, I don't know if they want to do that with this. Is there going to be an alert that's sent to you via email or text that you've received a a reply.

494
00:50:41.913 --> 00:50:43.020
Tyler: Right, okay.

495
00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:45.769
> P3: And if there is, it needs to be on here that you'll

496
00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:48.339
> P3: something to let you know that

497
00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:52.220
> P3: you will receive a, an alert, an email, or something.

498
00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:53.180
Tyler: Right? Okay.

499
00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:55.590
> P3: I mean, that's how it makes it so much easier with

500
00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:57.510
> P3: My healthy bit so.

501
00:50:58.110 --> 00:51:07.960
Tyler: For sure, I can totally understand that. So if you're gonna ask the Va a question, you would hope that they're also gonna send you an email telling you that they're they have a reply for you.

502
00:51:08.275 --> 00:51:22.029
Tyler: and that they would let you know that. So that makes a lot of sense, I think. What we'll do now I'm just having a look at the time. We've got about 30 more minutes together. Do you need to take a break. How are you doing.

503
00:51:22.030 --> 00:51:24.940
> P3: I just I got some water here. I don't know if you can hear me drinking so.

504
00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:28.936
Tyler: Perfect. No, I can't hear you, but that's perfect. Okay, well, this has been really helpful to look at this page. What I'd like us to do next is to find a question that you submitted on August 24.th

506
00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:44.223
Tyler: And when once we find that question on August 24th I'd like for you to figure out how we're going to read the reply from the Va.

508
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.589
Tyler: So the question you submitted on August 24.th

509
00:51:52.190 --> 00:51:52.840
> P3: Now

510
00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:56.140
> P3: how to go there.

511
00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:05.290
> P3: I'm not just going straight to it. It's just

512
00:52:08.290 --> 00:52:09.490
> P3: wow! Wait a minute.

513
00:52:21.820 --> 00:52:29.969
> P3: I mean, this one is you said this look fine. The dates I went to the oldest. I stayed in the oldest, and it took me straight to this one. On August.

514
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.110
> P3: Mistaken.

515
00:52:33.050 --> 00:52:34.989
Tyler: And what day was this submitted? Oh.

516
00:52:37.830 --> 00:52:39.044
> P3: Oh, April! Sorry!

517
00:52:39.450 --> 00:52:41.660
Tyler: That's okay. That's really similar.

518
00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:43.769
> P3: Okay. So April, then I know that.

519
00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:55.169
> P3: Oh, wait a minute. This is November. Should have had August.

520
00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:58.190
> P3: I don't remember.

521
00:53:10.830 --> 00:53:11.620
Tyler: Okay.

522
00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:14.000
Tyler: I'm just gonna have us pause here. So.

523
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:14.910
> P3: Yeah.

524
00:53:14.910 --> 00:53:20.920
Tyler: I can see you're going through all the questions, and we're not finding one that was submitted on August 24th

525
00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:24.139
Tyler: is that because there's a filter on the page.

526
00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:27.530
> P3: There could be.

527
00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:28.540
Tyler: Okay.

528
00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:33.020
Tyler: but if it if there is a filter it's not clear right then it's

529
00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:34.420
Tyler: but it's on.

530
00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:42.129
> P3: So I guess we need to do that.

531
00:53:48.350 --> 00:53:49.210
> P3: Hmm.

532
00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:16.020
Tyler: So.

533
00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:17.060
> P3: Yeah.

534
00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:20.730
Tyler: Were you trying to change this? The filter right now? And it wasn't changing.

535
00:54:20.730 --> 00:54:22.150
> P3: Yeah, it won't change. I can't get.

536
00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:24.100
Tyler: Yeah, I noticed that

537
00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:26.759
Tyler: I was on the.

538
00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:29.490
> P3: I was wanting to find out if it said.

539
00:54:30.775 --> 00:54:32.080
> P3: You know either

540
00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:35.807
> P3: month or something something to give me.

541
00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:41.600
Tyler: Why don't we try and open.

542
00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:42.910
> P3: Okay, go ahead.

543
00:54:42.910 --> 00:54:50.810
Tyler: Let's try and open that filter one more time, because I did notice you opened it, and then it was like jumping you out of the filter which is making it hard for you.

544
00:54:50.810 --> 00:54:51.660
> P3: You know. Yes.

545
00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:04.720
> P3: just reopened.

546
00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:06.170
> P3: replied

547
00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:07.910
> P3: in progress.

548
00:55:09.450 --> 00:55:10.799
> P3: And then I can do all.

549
00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:18.141
> P3: Can they have a filter by date.

550
00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:22.889
> P3: Just don't make life easier.

551
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:29.060
> P3: Okay.

552
00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:34.879
> P3: okay. Here we go.

553
00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:35.630
Tyler: Okay.

554
00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:38.549
> P3: And this is once been reopened. I don't know what that means, but.

555
00:55:38.550 --> 00:55:59.549
Tyler: Right. Okay, awesome. So obviously, that took a bit of time to find. And that was mostly because the filter was on. But that wasn't clear, and then it wasn't also that easy to switch the filter off. I did see that once. Once you could get into the filter it was pretty easy for you to go through the different options. So I think there was something funny that might have happened.

556
00:56:00.674 --> 00:56:02.210
Tyler: With the website. So

### Details page

Tyler: we're on this question now, and let's go ahead and navigate. To the Va's reply to this question that you asked on August 24.th

558
00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:26.478
> P3: I was thinking I would click that I would. Why is it not working.

559
00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:29.290
Tyler: Okay, let's pause there, because that's really.

560
00:56:29.290 --> 00:56:30.080
> P3: Sorry. Really helped.

561
00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:31.560
Tyler: No, you're good. Let's stay. We can stay on this.

562
00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:32.420
> P3: Yeah.

563
00:56:32.420 --> 00:56:57.883
Tyler: That was really helpful. It made a lot of sense. I wanna actually say it out loud. So I can remember it, too. So you were searching for the A. Way to read the Va's reply, and you navigated to something that said replied, so you thought, Okay, that's what I'll click on. But actually, that wasn't a link which is confusing. So that makes total sense. And it was the link above which we've now clicked on. And now we're on this page.

564
00:56:58.180 --> 00:57:01.061
> P3: So can't you put check? I mean, have you got?

565
00:57:01.690 --> 00:57:04.600
> P3: I think you said the check details?

566
00:57:07.460 --> 00:57:15.869
> P3: I don't know. It's something that might to me it seems like that needs to be worded, for, you know that's where you can also go. For the reply.

567
00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:21.969
Tyler: Yeah. So I mean you. You heard the.

568
00:57:21.970 --> 00:57:22.930
> P3: The wording.

569
00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:24.030
Tyler: Yeah.

570
00:57:24.030 --> 00:57:26.449
> P3: Quick. Do you think details? Okay? But

571
00:57:28.660 --> 00:57:32.769
> P3: check group details and replies, I don't know. It's something that would make it

572
00:57:33.540 --> 00:57:35.010
> P3: very

573
00:57:40.750 --> 00:57:41.500
Tyler: Obvious.

574
00:57:41.890 --> 00:57:47.747
> P3: Mindset. Yeah. Well, there's a reply. The replies in my details.

575
00:57:48.460 --> 00:57:55.749
> P3: I don't know, but we were always told that we needed to write our things at 6th grade level.

576
00:57:57.280 --> 00:58:03.910
Tyler: yeah, and check details. Maybe that sounds less like something. You would actually say, to someone is that

577
00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:05.500
Tyler: kind of what you mean.

578
00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:07.270
> P3: Yeah, yeah.

579
00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:07.980
Tyler: So.

580
00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:16.909
> P3: I just think it needs to add something in there that they know. Okay, check details, including replies. Or I don't know. Okay.

581
00:58:17.430 --> 00:58:18.020
> P3: Still.

582
00:58:18.410 --> 00:58:20.790
> P3: that's just me. But you know, as you.

583
00:58:20.790 --> 00:58:21.190
Tyler: Yeah.

584
00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:25.720
> P3: Test other people. You can gather that up. Maybe other people won't pay attention to it, but I do.

585
00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:27.569
Tyler: Yeah, no, I I like it.

586
00:58:27.570 --> 00:58:28.890
> P3: And be straightforward.

587
00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:32.240
> P3: Send these details? Why am I gonna click here.

588
00:58:33.090 --> 00:58:44.829
Tyler: Yeah, right? I can. I can totally understand that. Well, speaking of that now, we're on this page. And the 1st thing I'd like you to do on this page is to find the reply that the Va sent to you.

589
00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:46.230
Tyler: Yeah.

590
00:59:44.650 --> 00:59:46.020
Tyler: okay, so.

591
00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:48.859
> P3: Okay. I just wanted to say what all it said down through there. So sorry.

592
00:59:48.860 --> 00:59:51.268
Tyler: Yeah, that's totally fine. So

593
00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:56.730
Tyler: let's go back up to the Va's reply, and then we'll talk about that for for a minute.

594
01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:07.549
Tyler: All right. So

595
01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:12.069
Tyler: how did you navigate to find this reply on the page.

596
01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:17.840
> P3: Well, that expand.

597
01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:53.130
Tyler: hmm.

598
01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:56.679
> P3: I mean, I went there, and that was just

599
01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:01.203
> P3: because usually when I hear a collapse button, I go there. But

600
01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:10.500
Tyler: okay. So when I 1st asked for you to find the Va's reply, I sort of watched, you go through the page.

601
01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:10.830
> P3: No.

602
01:01:10.830 --> 01:01:23.250
Tyler: You went past your question, and then you you found something that you decided to open. And that was the reply from the Va. What? What made you realize that that was the reply. From the Va. What did you hear.

603
01:01:32.690 --> 01:01:35.109
> P3: This is response from Va, so that would.

604
01:01:35.110 --> 01:01:35.930
Tyler: Present.

605
01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:37.110
Tyler: Okay.

606
01:01:37.470 --> 01:01:42.050
Tyler: And how was that? How was that for you? Finding the the response from the Va.

607
01:01:48.510 --> 01:01:50.460
> P3: I still have to go through a lot of.

608
01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:53.089
> P3: Mumbo Jumbo, just to find it.

609
01:01:54.810 --> 01:01:55.140
Tyler: yeah.

610
01:01:55.435 --> 01:02:01.649
> P3: Yeah, I gotta leave. I gotta read all this. Listen to all this. Okay, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Where's my response?

611
01:02:01.650 --> 01:02:03.500
Tyler: Yeah.

612
01:02:03.830 --> 01:02:06.680
Tyler: what could make it easier for you if we could change.

613
01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:07.640
> P3: Change something.

614
01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:16.430
> P3: up here. Click! This reply to read reply, click! Instead of having to go through

615
01:02:16.450 --> 01:02:17.790
> P3: everything.

616
01:02:17.790 --> 01:02:18.610
Tyler: Yeah.

617
01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:19.680
Tyler: yeah.

618
01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:25.910
> P3: You can go back and read this, I mean, but if you want to find it out fast, or if you in a hurry or.

619
01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:27.150
> P3: yeah.

620
01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:36.020
> P3: I mean a lot of times when you're working, you gotta go check something that the Va is in because you got an email or a text and say, Hey, you got a response.

621
01:02:36.290 --> 01:02:36.690
Tyler: Yeah.

622
01:02:36.690 --> 01:02:42.119
> P3: You want to do it, you want to do it fast. That's why I said at the very beginning, if it has something you can click on.

623
01:02:42.630 --> 01:02:45.389
> P3: And having to go, set this filter, that filter, and

624
01:02:46.010 --> 01:02:48.980
> P3: I just want to click and say, Hey, you know.

625
01:02:49.770 --> 01:02:50.150
Tyler: Yeah.

626
01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:52.850
> P3: Replies and click on it. And it's gonna list and.

627
01:02:53.010 --> 01:02:53.800
Tyler: Yeah.

628
01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:54.630
Tyler: I'm in.

629
01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:55.450
> P3: Easy.

630
01:02:55.450 --> 01:02:56.330
Tyler: Yeah.

631
01:02:56.610 --> 01:03:05.149
Tyler: and you're are you kind of thinking of your email inbox when you say, like, I'm expecting it to say, this has a reply, and this has a reply, and I don't need to focus on the other stuff.

632
01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:06.150
Tyler: Right? Yeah.

633
01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:07.799
> P3: I don't want to. Yeah.

634
01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:08.610
Tyler: Yeah.

635
01:03:08.730 --> 01:03:17.839
Tyler: And and from the very beginning you've been like expecting, like a link upfront that could let you read the reply from the Va, so you're like this is just taking longer than.

636
01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:25.189
> P3: Right. I gotta go through, you know, especially with I mean, you know, sighted people can go through it a lot faster. But when you're using.

637
01:03:25.330 --> 01:03:30.039
> P3: You know, technology, you you can go through a fast. But then you miss something.

638
01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:30.840
Tyler: Companion.

639
01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:32.509
> P3: Go back. Go back. Go back. Back. Okay.

640
01:03:32.510 --> 01:03:34.529
Tyler: Totally. Yeah. You have to stay.

641
01:03:34.530 --> 01:03:37.720
> P3: All over everywhere. And then by the time you get to the reply, you're like.

642
01:03:38.330 --> 01:03:39.020
> P3: Yeah.

643
01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:40.070
Tyler: For sure.

644
01:03:40.070 --> 01:03:41.352
> P3: In, on, this.

645
01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:44.283
Tyler: Right that makes sense.

646
01:03:45.230 --> 01:03:50.709
Tyler: do you think this is something that you would use on your phone or on your computer, or either one.

647
01:03:51.516 --> 01:04:09.580
> P3: Both of them. It's according to what I'm going to ask if it's something simple, like a quick question. I would do it on my phone. But if it's something that I really need a lot more details in, I like to do it in on my computer. Sometimes I'll write out my question in word, and then copy and paste it into.

648
01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:10.690
Tyler: Yeah.

649
01:04:10.690 --> 01:04:14.800
> P3: So that's when I get on the computer, especially if it's a

650
01:04:15.290 --> 01:04:18.929
> P3: question I need, you know, really exact answer. So.

651
01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:20.379
Tyler: That makes sense.

652
01:04:21.017 --> 01:04:22.689
Tyler: Okay, so let's

653
01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:32.779
Tyler: let's go read what the Va. Said to you. So we'll read that reply. I'll give you a minute to do that, and then let me know what the Va. Is telling you in their message.

654
01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:56.190
> P3: Okay, this says, this is really confusing.

655
01:04:56.560 --> 01:05:03.760
> P3: In which maybe it's just questions you guys typed up. But they're just asking for a Va id card. Okay?

656
01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:05.810
> P3: You know.

657
01:05:10.350 --> 01:05:13.110
> P3: I mean, okay, is this

658
01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:25.770
> P3: is this card? I mean, I know all about this. But is this card? I'm just throwing this out there to you guys, is this card. Okay, I can only get this card digitally. Or can I go to the Va. And get it.

659
01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:27.160
> P3: You know.

660
01:05:29.770 --> 01:05:32.959
Tyler: That makes sense. So it's not very clear whether it's a.

661
01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:33.310
> P3: Did you want.

662
01:05:33.310 --> 01:05:35.560
Tyler: Thing, or you can go in person is.

663
01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:35.880
> P3: Right.

664
01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:40.480
Tyler: Hear whether you can get a Va. Card for a spouse. That's not a veteran.

665
01:05:43.810 --> 01:05:47.640
> P3: Yeah, it's just it does tell you that it's only available to

666
01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:48.640
Tyler: Okay.

667
01:05:49.116 --> 01:05:55.310
> P3: Now, there are some situations that the dependents can get va cards, if

668
01:05:55.340 --> 01:05:56.763
> P3: you know, with certain

669
01:05:57.620 --> 01:05:58.929
> P3: status of zoom.

670
01:05:59.400 --> 01:05:59.870
Tyler: Okay.

671
01:06:01.340 --> 01:06:03.965
> P3: that they're using the Va. For release.

672
01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:08.300
> P3: but that they would be talking to eligibility. They would be coming on here.

673
01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:10.530
Tyler: Right? Gotcha. Okay?

674
01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:17.359
Tyler: So it, the part where it says digital is a bit confusing, which makes sense to me as well. So

675
01:06:17.660 --> 01:06:21.420
Tyler: there's also a message that was sent on September 12.th

676
01:06:21.846 --> 01:06:26.889
Tyler: Can you find that message for me and tell me who sent the message on September 12? th

677
01:06:32.805 --> 01:06:35.330
> P3: It's the reply. So I

678
01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:38.719
> P3: replied to him because I didn't understand him. I guess.

679
01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:49.750
Tyler: Got it. Okay? So let's imagine that you replied like something like you just said to me, you said something like, Okay, if it's if you say digital does that mean I can't go in person to get.

680
01:06:50.830 --> 01:06:55.520
Tyler: A veteran id card? So let's pretend like you replied that.

681
01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:57.090
Tyler: And

682
01:06:57.861 --> 01:07:04.680
Tyler: you've been waiting like over a week. You've got no reply from the Va. At this point.

683
01:07:06.050 --> 01:07:08.299
Tyler: What would you do at that point?

684
01:07:10.890 --> 01:07:21.051
> P3: I would probably call the Eligibility Office, which I always hate to, because they're so backed up there. I mean that your local I would call a local eligibility office.

685
01:07:21.530 --> 01:07:24.949
> P3: you know. And that's why we're trying to do all of this, because

686
01:07:25.770 --> 01:07:29.490
> P3: in some of these offices there's not enough staff.

687
01:07:30.690 --> 01:07:36.739
> P3: And so here I am, tying up a staff. That this would have been easily answered with.

688
01:07:36.890 --> 01:07:38.130
> P3: you know

689
01:07:38.430 --> 01:07:47.610
> P3: this is not for dependence, but you can get your own, you know the veteran can get their va digitally, or they can get it in person

690
01:07:47.830 --> 01:07:49.780
> P3: at their local Va.

691
01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:50.510
Tyler: Gotcha.

692
01:07:50.510 --> 01:07:54.949
> P3: And then I would have a link that said, Here's how you can find your local Va.

693
01:07:55.740 --> 01:08:00.030
Tyler: Right. That's super helpful. It's like it's really useful to hear you.

694
01:08:00.030 --> 01:08:00.590
> P3: Huh!

695
01:08:00.923 --> 01:08:11.942
Tyler: Tell me in your words what kind of response you're expecting cause. I can see how different that is from what the Va. Has responded here. So that's that's super useful. So

### Reply sent

Tyler: I know that it's unlikely this would actually happen. But let's pretend, like you wanted to send the Va. Another reply at this point, so like you had another question, and you decided you were just going to send another reply.

697
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:31.049
Tyler: Can you show me how you can reply back to the Va. Again.

698
01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:38.710
> P3: My bear.

699
01:08:39.330 --> 01:08:39.810
Tyler: Okay.

700
01:08:39.819 --> 01:08:41.099
> P3: What's the other reply?

701
01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:42.149
Tyler: Okay.

702
01:08:42.806 --> 01:08:52.919
Tyler: let's go ahead and send a message. You don't need to write out a whole reply, but maybe just like a couple of of pretend words. And then we'll go ahead and send that to the Va.

703
01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:04.149
> P3: Yeah, well.

704
01:09:04.359 --> 01:09:05.750
> P3: you're going to get anything.

705
01:09:17.470 --> 01:09:18.880
> P3: Now, here, see.

706
01:09:19.069 --> 01:09:20.980
> P3: oh, I can't dictate because I got it

707
01:09:21.069 --> 01:09:24.220
> P3: headset on, okay, I'm just gonna write this. Okay, I'm gonna send you.

708
01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:29.409
Tyler: That's perfect. Yeah, so, but you're saying you normally would try and use the dictation rather.

709
01:09:29.410 --> 01:09:32.061
> P3: I do. I use dictation a lot.

710
01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:35.190
> P3: If I'm not using dictation

711
01:09:35.410 --> 01:09:41.910
> P3: I'm using, you know, like I said, I'll write it in notes, copy and paste it into there. If it's something I really want. Okay.

712
01:09:42.010 --> 01:09:45.129
> P3: I want to make sure they get this very clear.

713
01:09:45.436 --> 01:09:53.723
Tyler: For sure, that makes a lot of sense. And obviously right now, you're on a zoom call, so you can't use that but that's helpful to know

714
01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:58.480
Tyler: Anything else that you need to do before you send your reply.

715
01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:10.650
> P3: I mean, I don't have anything to upload if I did, you know, because I have. I've uploaded stuff to the doctors and dustin

716
01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:11.810
Tyler: Right.

717
01:10:11.810 --> 01:10:14.640
> P3: And to the Va. You know. But

718
01:10:15.410 --> 01:10:19.859
> P3: and that's something else I mean is this, I'm assuming this is going to be secure.

719
01:10:22.230 --> 01:10:26.008
> P3: That's something that people's going to want to make sure when you're doing this select

720
01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:28.850
Tyler: yeah.

721
01:10:29.570 --> 01:10:32.010
Tyler: And do you have to upload a file.

722
01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:35.460
> P3: No, you don't have to.

723
01:10:35.660 --> 01:10:36.320
Tyler: Okay.

724
01:10:37.630 --> 01:10:39.189
Tyler: Alright, let's go ahead and send that.

725
01:10:39.190 --> 01:10:40.020
> P3: Optional.

726
01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:40.840
Tyler: Okay.

727
01:10:47.090 --> 01:10:50.240
> P3: Okay. So I know. My response was submitted successfully.

728
01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:54.810
> P3: Yup.

729
01:10:57.810 --> 01:10:58.630
> P3: okay.

730
01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:03.010
> P3: okay, so it does. 7 business days.

731
01:11:03.010 --> 01:11:03.750
Tyler: Okay.

732
01:11:05.700 --> 01:11:15.370
Tyler: At this point it's obviously given you some information after you sent your response. Would you have any more follow up questions? Or would you just be like, Okay, I've got to go. Wait now.

733
01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:20.659
> P3: Just wait, I mean, that's all I all you ever do.

734
01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:21.620
Tyler: Yeah.

735
01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:35.710
> P3: I wonder, you know, back at the back, when you were given it gives a description of ask a question. If you I I don't remember reading that at all, because I did question about it. If it was in there that, just like it is right here.

736
01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:42.519
> P3: you should receive a reply. Within 7 days, 7 business days, and you always have 6 business days

737
01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:51.100
> P3: because you didn't tell me that up there. And so if I you know, I wouldn't know that until I have to send reply. And it's like, Oh, yeah.

738
01:11:51.130 --> 01:11:55.239
> P3: it doesn't say how long it's gonna take. So I might as well call the other. Va.

739
01:11:55.450 --> 01:11:56.310
> P3: yeah.

740
01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:00.160
Tyler: That makes sense so.

741
01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:16.339
> P3: I don't know. I just feel like you. You don't have enough details on what? Because ask questions is going to be. There's going to be a lot of questions. 1st of all, is going to be security around. Okay, I'm gonna upload these. Is it going to be? Is this secure? Is this a secure place to upload my documents? There's a lot of private stuff.

742
01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:23.220
> P3: and then, you know, at the very beginning, I need to know, cause if it's going to.

743
01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:28.660
> P3: you know, if it's not, gonna tell me if it's going to say 7 business days.

744
01:12:29.190 --> 01:12:32.379
> P3: But I'm gonna need this a little bit earlier. I better go ahead and.

745
01:12:32.810 --> 01:12:34.770
Tyler: Right, yeah.

746
01:12:34.770 --> 01:12:38.259
> P3: I think it should say 7 business days up front, right up front.

747
01:12:38.450 --> 01:12:39.220
Tyler: Yeah.

748
01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:46.209
Tyler: for sure. So you maybe wouldn't have sent a reply if you knew it was 7 business days. So that should be more clear.

749
01:12:46.310 --> 01:12:47.900
Tyler: Yeah, for sure.

750
01:12:48.430 --> 01:12:56.440
> P3: And I don't know I haven't written. I haven't done a question. So, sending a question, I don't know if it's going to say that one system

751
01:12:56.580 --> 01:13:03.290
> P3: which I would like to know it up front. How long is it going to take for me to get this question answered? Is this something I need this week.

752
01:13:04.050 --> 01:13:05.089
> P3: or can I.

### Cool down

Tyler: yeah, I mean, if we think back to the very beginning of our conversation, when you said, I haven't been able to find, ask Va. And I'm also not sure if it's like a chat bot or an AI thing.

754
01:13:16.470 --> 01:13:17.080
> P3: And.

755
01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:34.070
Tyler: Obviously this is quite different to some of the things you were imagining about. Ask Va, so I can see how it's really important for us to set expectations upfront about the tool you're using, because, you might be unfamiliar with it, or you might have other ideas for for how it works.

756
01:13:34.589 --> 01:13:39.229
Tyler: So that I think that's really helpful. I can totally understand why 7 business days

757
01:13:39.575 --> 01:13:44.150
Tyler: is a pretty like defining part of whether you should use this tool or not.

758
01:13:45.450 --> 01:13:55.059
Tyler: and there's another thing on this page that I wanted to just chat about. It's it says your question has now been reopened. And we talked about how reopened is confusing.

759
01:13:55.530 --> 01:13:59.190
Tyler: What do you think they're trying to say when they say your question has now been reopened?

760
01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:02.570
> P3: I mean.

761
01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:12.940
> P3: I'm assuming that they're they're going to not close my, my.

762
01:14:15.210 --> 01:14:16.570
> P3: you know, like, with

763
01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:21.760
> P3: a lot of them, it'll say we are closing your your chat, or whatever

764
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:25.369
> P3: I'm assuming now that they're not going to close this. They're going to reopen it.

765
01:14:30.270 --> 01:14:31.110
> P3: But

766
01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:35.780
> P3: I don't know. I.

767
01:14:35.780 --> 01:14:37.550
Tyler: There's something about it that still.

768
01:14:37.550 --> 01:14:40.800
> P3: It just doesn't right. It doesn't. It doesn't feel

769
01:14:41.431 --> 01:14:45.299
> P3: that reopened. I mean, as always, this company with the Va.

770
01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:47.059
> P3: You hear a lot. I don't know.

771
01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:48.080
Tyler: Yeah.

772
01:14:48.970 --> 01:14:49.550
> P3: When.

773
01:14:49.550 --> 01:14:58.690
Tyler: When a case is reopened with the Va. I I assume. But I'd like you to let me know is that like a positive thing that the case has been reopened.

774
01:14:59.290 --> 01:15:01.049
> P3: It can make the veteran nervous.

775
01:15:01.050 --> 01:15:04.050
Tyler: It can make a veteran nervous. Okay? So when you hear it.

776
01:15:04.050 --> 01:15:05.120
> P3: Context.

777
01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:16.508
> P3: right? Because, oh, yeah, especially if you're working well. I mean, like, I've been working with a veteran that is trying to apply for disability. He's got a lot of things going on, you know. He's

778
01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:23.621
> P3: so and and then he gets this response. So you're you know, you're

779
01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:27.669
> P3: yeah, you know, it's been reopened, it's like.

780
01:15:27.810 --> 01:15:39.890
> P3: you know. Then everything's going through their heel. Then the anxiety sets in, and then they start calling everybody in the Va. The doctor and the everybody, you know. Well, why? Why are they reopening my case?

781
01:15:40.170 --> 01:15:42.100
> P3: So they're gonna just say the word

782
01:15:42.430 --> 01:15:43.580
> P3: reopened.

783
01:15:44.660 --> 01:16:05.590
Tyler: Okay, that's really helpful. And we've done research on this in the past. And we know that veterans tend to think of case statuses when they read these statuses. And so I can see how what you're saying could be a problem. So that's helpful. What if it said, your question is now in progress. What would your reaction be?

784
01:16:05.980 --> 01:16:12.130
> P3: That that would be better. So I know, okay, there's still okay. We're still continuing with this conversation.

785
01:16:12.130 --> 01:16:13.900
Tyler: Okay. And that would.

786
01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:15.569
> P3: Reopen a claim so.

787
01:16:15.570 --> 01:16:16.770
Tyler: Right? Okay?

788
01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:24.290
Tyler: And that would mean that a question could be, it could say replied. And then it could move back to being in progress.

789
01:16:24.290 --> 01:16:24.940
> P3: Program.

790
01:16:24.940 --> 01:16:27.150
Tyler: Is that okay? Or is that confusing.

791
01:16:27.410 --> 01:16:29.539
> P3: I think that's that's way. Better. I mean.

792
01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:29.890
Tyler: A 100.

793
01:16:29.890 --> 01:16:33.120
> P3: Times better. You're not going to get a veteran, all

794
01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:34.530
> P3: anxious.

795
01:16:35.730 --> 01:16:36.080
Tyler: Yeah.

796
01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:37.010
> P3: Relax.

797
01:16:37.010 --> 01:16:44.783
Tyler: That makes sense. Okay, that's really helpful. I see we've got like a couple of minutes left. And I think,

798
01:16:45.560 --> 01:17:08.720
Tyler: you you're welcome to just keep sharing your screen here if you if you don't want to like fuss with it. But we're all done testing the website. And I kind of want to just reflect on how all of that was for you. We've talked a lot throughout the process. Is there anything that you found particularly challenging. Especially with using your screen, reader, through this process.

799
01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:13.760
> P3: just the

800
01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:15.049
> P3: I felt like

801
01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:19.300
> P3: I was having to jump through too many loops to do what I wanted to do.

802
01:17:20.540 --> 01:17:21.210
Tyler: yeah.

803
01:17:23.370 --> 01:17:36.620
> P3: it, and I felt like it wasn't as straightforward as I thought it would be. Now, I mean, would I learn it? Yeah, I would learn and figure it out. How would I use it? I don't know, because if I have to go through all of these different loops

804
01:17:36.710 --> 01:17:42.810
> P3: jumps. Just to get to what I want to do is ask the question, okay, am I gonna bother with this.

805
01:17:44.295 --> 01:17:45.780
Tyler: yeah, definitely.

806
01:17:45.780 --> 01:17:46.559
> P3: Yeah.

807
01:17:48.420 --> 01:18:03.210
Tyler: And I think you made a really good point when we were talking about some of those loops that we were ending up in, and you said for a sighted person this might be a little bit quicker to move between these screens, but for me, I'm going through all of these different pieces of content, in order to find.

808
01:18:03.210 --> 01:18:03.690
> P3: That.

809
01:18:03.690 --> 01:18:10.159
Tyler: I'm looking for and that's that's super helpful to to kind of better understand.

810
01:18:11.564 --> 01:18:25.599
Tyler: Was there any kind of moment when like, for example, when we clicked on that page 2, we got sent down to the footer of the page, which was unexpected. Was there any other time when something unexpected like that happened.

811
01:18:26.919 --> 01:18:31.109
> P3: When we came back from when we went from page 2, back

812
01:18:31.180 --> 01:18:41.330
> P3: didn't take me to the top of the page. It took me into the middle of a question which that could have been the last place I was. That might be what it's doing. Instead of taking you back to the top.

813
01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:42.650
> P3: He's taking you back

814
01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:47.629
> P3: to a question. So then you got to go back all the way up to the top to then you find whatever you want to do.

815
01:18:47.870 --> 01:18:48.990
Tyler: Right? Okay.

816
01:18:48.990 --> 01:18:51.610
> P3: Cause most of the time. It brings you back to the top of the page.

817
01:18:51.610 --> 01:18:53.000
Tyler: Right? Yeah.

818
01:18:53.260 --> 01:18:54.280
Tyler: totally.

819
01:18:54.730 --> 01:18:57.020
Tyler: Is there anything else you can remember?

820
01:18:58.610 --> 01:18:59.670
> P3: no

821
01:19:00.167 --> 01:19:05.782
> P3: I mean, there's I mean, we need this desperately, you know.

822
01:19:06.540 --> 01:19:10.450
> P3: I I can see now it's going to be a person responding

823
01:19:10.630 --> 01:19:16.949
> P3: which is great. But you know, when you just need a form or something, or where's where can I find this form?

824
01:19:17.110 --> 01:19:22.040
> P3: And I guess the categories that they're going to have like tech.

825
01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:32.762
> P3: you know, if you need assistance for the app, or if you need disability, Id, that's going to be good. That will be a positive to this. Be able to go to that, because that's how we have it on the

826
01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:34.539
> P3: messaging online.

827
01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:35.280
Tyler: Yeah.

828
01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:36.700
> P3: I help you with it. But yeah.

829
01:19:36.700 --> 01:19:37.300
Tyler: Sure.

830
01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:40.989
> P3: I mean, I can see positives. And I can see negatives right now.

831
01:19:41.470 --> 01:19:42.030
> P3: Yeah.

832
01:19:42.030 --> 01:19:42.600
Tyler: Yeah.

833
01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:43.750
> P3: Screen readers, yeah.

834
01:19:45.230 --> 01:19:47.229
> P3: We're going to get more aggravated.

835
01:19:47.550 --> 01:19:56.086
> P3: Yeah. And then, well, and you know, when you've got veterans that they really need to get a question answered, how long is it gonna take? Is it going? Are they really? Gonna you know.

836
01:19:57.070 --> 01:19:58.270
> P3: I can see it.

837
01:19:58.570 --> 01:20:04.960
Tyler: Is the is the reason that you can tell. It's now going to be a person replying to you, because it's going to take 7 business days.

838
01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:05.960
> P3: Yes.

839
01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:08.840
Tyler: Okay, yeah. And

840
01:20:09.010 --> 01:20:15.339
Tyler: at the start, we talked about how you know, you were okay with things like AI or like an automated

841
01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:19.800
Tyler: system. If it got you information more quickly. So

842
01:20:19.830 --> 01:20:21.309
Tyler: let's say,

843
01:20:22.660 --> 01:20:27.510
Tyler: like, how how might this tool that we looked at together today?

844
01:20:28.970 --> 01:20:29.960
Tyler: work

845
01:20:30.580 --> 01:20:36.360
Tyler: with AI, if you can imagine, like, what could be automated about what's happening in this tool.

846
01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:56.909
> P3: But just like that id question that could have popped right up. It could have, I mean, AI would have pulled out the information. You know, independence cannot get this, but veterans can get theirs digitally at this link, or they can go to their local Va. And this is where you can find your local Va.

847
01:20:57.190 --> 01:20:58.240
> P3: With a link.

848
01:20:58.745 --> 01:20:59.250
Tyler: Okay.

849
01:20:59.250 --> 01:21:08.709
> P3: AI will do that. It will pull out all that stuff, you know. It will put it all together. But now, when you're getting into this where you need to upload information.

850
01:21:09.971 --> 01:21:20.559
> P3: That's where you're gonna have veterans questioning that, you know, is this secure? So there's certain some things that. But and but usually when it you you're I mean work with

851
01:21:20.730 --> 01:21:21.930
> P3: AI,

852
01:21:22.090 --> 01:21:24.140
> P3: I mean, usually, if you get to a

853
01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:32.960
> P3: something like that with the bank or anything like that, it'll say, well, let me connect you with an agent or something.

854
01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:33.360
Tyler: Okay.

855
01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:35.900
> P3: And then you're connected with a live agent.

856
01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:36.880
Tyler: Yeah.

857
01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:44.619
Tyler: that makes a lot of sense. So simple questions, things where you can receive information. You are okay working with AI, and maybe

858
01:21:45.020 --> 01:22:14.940
Tyler: once it gets to the point of you needing to like share more information, or you want to make sure it's definitely secure, or it's more complex than you would expect to be able to to speak to a person. I I can totally see a world where that would improve a tool like this. So. That that's really helpful. We we've we're kind of at the end of our session. So I do want to give you a second in case you have any questions for me or our team or about this research.

859
01:22:15.650 --> 01:22:22.527
> P3: No, I mean, I'm I'm glad they're working on all of this. I mean, there's things that I've seen already change on

860
01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:25.160
> P3: my healthy vet that.

861
01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:25.500
Tyler: I hear.

862
01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:29.310
> P3: You guys worked on and improved. I now can, because, like

863
01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:39.230
> P3: it was where? When you would go and you needed to put in like General, or whatever, or to the what doctor. It wouldn't even read it. A guy would, I mean,

864
01:22:40.770 --> 01:22:43.989
> P3: I mean, our accessible software wouldn't even read it.

865
01:22:44.620 --> 01:22:46.545
> P3: So we're making improvements. Yay.

866
01:22:46.930 --> 01:22:52.110
Tyler: Yeah, well, we're making improvements because we get to meet with folks like you. So I really.

867
01:22:52.110 --> 01:22:54.319
> P3: Really appreciate it. Well.

868
01:22:54.340 --> 01:22:59.960
> P3: I mean, this helps my life. This helps me have my life better. So that's why I do it.

869
01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:03.060
Tyler: Good. Yeah. Well, you're doing it for you and other veterans.

870
01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:03.900
> P3: And.

871
01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:05.140
Tyler: Us. So

872
01:23:05.820 --> 01:23:11.989
Tyler: I appreciate it. Well, [P3], it's been a pleasure. I really appreciate the the time. Have a good rest of your day. Okay.

873
01:23:11.990 --> 01:23:13.480
