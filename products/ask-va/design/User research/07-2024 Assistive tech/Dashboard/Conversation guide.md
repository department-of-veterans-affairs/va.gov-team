## Intro (5 minutes)

> Start transcript: `LIVE TRANSCRIPT` > `ENABLE`.

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Tyler]. How are you?

I’m a researcher from VA. I work on improving VA.gov so it's easier for Veterans to contact VA online if they have a question.

My colleague is also here. They're an accessibility specialist and they're here to support you and I during this conversation.

> Accessibility specialist says hello.

**What I hope to do today** is get a sense of how we can make this process better.

**What I don't want to do** is add to any frustration that you've had with contacting VA in the past. I want to be up front and say that I don't have a way of fixing those past experiences. But, I do want to know about your frustration in case there's things we can improve in the future.

Before we get started, I just want to confirm a few things.

- Do you use a [tool] to access websites or applications?
- Which tool are you going to use today?

### Troubleshooting: If they're not using assistive tech
- We'll politely end the session. Refer to [pause and exit strategies](#pause-or-exit-strategies).

Okay great. Moving along, we have a few other people in the waiting room who might observe this session. They'd like to join to listen in, learn and take notes.

**I want to confirm now, are you okay with a couple of my teammates joining us to quietly observe?**

- `IF NO` Use Slack to let observers know.
- `IF YES` They're in the waiting room, so I'm going to let them into the meeting now.

> Let in observers from the waiting room.

Welcome. This is [participant].

Let's go around and say hello, starting with ____.

**Thanks everyone, now I’ll ask you to turn off your cameras and mute yourselves for the rest of the session.**

There are a few other things I want to mention before we start:

- **This session could take up to...**
   - Screen reader or alt navigation –– an hour and a half
   - Screen magnification –– an hour
   - I’ll make sure we finish on time, so I may occasionally move us along during the session, so we can cover everything.
- **We’re here to learn your honest opinions.** Negative feedback is helpful too, because it helps us learn how we can improve.
- **I also want to make it clear that we’re not testing your ability.** So, for example, if I ask if you understand something, it’s because I want to make sure the description is clear.
- **I’m going to share a prototype with you today.** This is like a test version of VA.gov. You're also going to sign in using a test account. This means, that we'll be using pretend information today. So the prototype won't have any of your actual data, like your name or Social security number.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, you just have to let me know.** And that might be a pause to get some water or to stop the session completely. You'll be paid even if we don't complete the full session.
- The last thing is about recordings. We can record the session to help us confirm we captured your opinions accurately and sometimes share video clips with our colleagues at VA. If we do this, we don’t link anything you share in the session to any information that could identify you. We remove your face and your name from the videos. **Knowing this, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
  - `IF NO` Don't record
  - `IF YES` Once I start recording, I’ll confirm again.

> Start recording: `RECORD TO CLOUD`.

I’ve started recording. I'd like to confirm again: **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?**

## Warm up (5 minutes)

It seems like we’re ready to get started. I'd like to begin by learning more about your experience with the VA and our online services.

- I'm curious, how long have you been a Veteran?
- Have you ever contacted the VA online or over the phone?
  - `IF NO`
    - Why might you contact the VA?
    - If you were going to contact the VA, would you prefer to call, go online or get in touch another way?
  - `IF YES`
    - Can you tell me about a time when you contacted the VA?
    - How do you usually contact the VA? Why?
    - How was the support you received?
- Have you ever heard of Ask VA?

Okay, great. Thanks for sharing that with me. It's helpful to know a little bit about how you've contacted the VA in past.

I'd also like to know a little more about how you're using your assistive tech.

- How long have you been using [tool]?
- How often do you use [tool]?
- What device are you using today? [Desktop, mobile, tablet, Mac, Windows, Android?]
- Why do you use [this tool]?

<details>
  <summary>Key things to notice</summary>

- Why do they choose to contact VA (instead of going elsewhere or doing another task)?
- How do they decide which channel to use when they contact the VA?
- Are they familiar with Ask VA?
- How do they rate their experience level with their assistive tech?
- How often do they use their assistive tech?

</details>

## Set up (10 minutes)

- Have you ever shared your screen on Zoom while using [tool]?

Okay, great. We're going to do that now. 

- [Have they shared before?]
  - `IF YES` Please share your screen when you're ready.
  - `IF NO` I’ll help guide you through how to share your screen...

### Troubleshooting: Screen share issues
- If testing with TTS software, like Dragon, ask the participant to share their **full screen** this way we can see the flags, grid, etc.
- If testing on VoiceOver (Mac), tell participants to navigate to "Share" (tab or they can do shift + command + S). Then, once they choose "Share," they need to share sound. They should tab until they hear "Share sound" and then check on. Then, choose, "Share" again to finish.
- Refer to [Screen reader instructions: Setting up screen share](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/screen-reader-instructions-and-troubleshooting-dur#Screenreaderinstructionsandtroubleshootingduringresearch-Settingupthescreenshare).
- Ask the accessibility specialist to come off mute and assist.
- Be patient. Reassure the participant that this can be confusing and we're here to work through it together.
- If after trying everything, screen share still isn't working: We'll politely end the session. Refer to [pause and exit strategies](#pause-or-exit-strategies).

> Screen sharing starts.

Thanks! Now I’m able to see your screen. I see [describe window].

Next, I'm going to share a link to the test website.

- Would you prefer that I send a link in the Zoom chat or dictate it to you?

> Dictate or send link in chat: [https://bit.ly/ask-va](https://bit.ly/ask-va).

<details>

  <summary>Suggestions for link sharing</summary>

- On JAWs, (Windows), dictate or email may be best.
- On TalkBack, (Android), share in the chat if typing is blocked.
- On TTS/Voice Command (Mac iOS), chat may be best. Or, if they aren't sure how to switch between applications, dictate.
   
</details>

> Opens staging. On the homepage.

Okay, great. Now, if you'll navigate to where it says Research Study. Then we're going to click on the sign in button under Research Study.

## Dashboard (30 minutes)

> Screen: Dashboard page

So, today we're going to observe as you navigate this website. 

Before you start, I'm going to share some context with you.

This is a tool called Ask VA. It's a way for Veterans to contact the VA and ask a question online. For today's session, we're going to pretend like you recently asked the VA a question and today you've just signed into your account on VA.gov to read the VA's reply to your question. We're going to go through a couple different tasks which I'll explain as we go.

And as you navigate, we want to understand what's going through your mind and how your assistive technology is supporting you. I'll try and stay quiet while you're focused on a task [and what your screen reader is announcing]. [If we can't hear their screen reader eg. on mobile, tell them that.]

It's helpful if you pause every once and a while and call out things that are surprising, confusing or helpful. 

- How does that all of that sound for you?

Okay, great.

So, let's get started. Instead of making you sign in today, we're going to imagine that you signed in and pretend like this is your account.

### Task 1

So, you've just arrived at Ask VA and the first thing I'd like you to do is orient yourself on this page.

I'll give you a couple minutes to navigate around. And after you finish, I'd like you explain this page to me.

`When they've finished...`

- What information is available on this page?
- What's the purpose of this page?
- Is there anything you found confusing as you navigated around this page?

### Task 2

Okay, great. There are a few questions on this page, and I'd like you to find a question that has a reply from the VA.

I'll give you a couple of minutes to navigate around. After you finish, I'd like you to explain which question you found.

`When they've finished...`

- Which question has a reply from VA?
- How do you know when there's a reply from VA?
- [Ask about statuses, if they mention them.]
- Is there more than one question that have a reply from VA?
- If you weren't sure how to find it, what would you do?

### Task 3

Next, I'd like you to find a question that's related to home loans.

`When they've finished...`

- Which question is related to home loans?
- How did you find the question that's related to housing assistance?
- If you weren't sure how to find it, what would you do?
- Did you have any difficulty navigating to the second page of questions?

### Task 4

Okay, this is the last task on this page. I'd like you to find the question that you submitted on August 24th.

`When they've finished...`

- Which question did you submit on August 24th?
- What is the question about?
- How did you find the question that you submitted on August 24th?
- If you weren't sure how to find it, what would you do?

### Task 5

Now, we're going to read the reply from the VA. I'd like you to show me how you would navigate to read what the VA replied to your question that you submitted on August 24th.

> Navigates to question details page.

<details>
  <summary>Key things to notice</summary>

- How do they navigate through the page elements?
- Are there any areas or components they struggle to interact with?
- Are all interactive elements properly labeled and announced?
- Is the tab order logical and easy to follow?
- Where did they pause, if at all?
- Is there any assistive tech behaviour you need them to explain, for example, what their screen reader announced on a particular element?
- Are statuses clear? Do they require more description? If so, just for screen reader users or for everyone?
- Do people have any difficulty navigating to the second page of questions?
- Do people, especially screen reader users, have any difficulty navigating to the correct Check details link?

</details>

## Details (20 minutes)

> Screen: Question details page

Okay, great.

- Before we talk about this page, did you have any difficulty finding the link to this page?

Great.

### Task 1

The first thing I'd like you to do is find the reply that the VA sent you.

`When they've finished...`

- What day did the VA reply to you?
- How did you navigate to the reply on this page?

### Task 2

Next, I'm going to give you some time to read the reply from the VA. And then I'd like you summarize their reply.

`When they've finished...`

- What did the VA say to you in this message?
- Would you have any follow up questions after reading this message?
- Is anything missing from their reply?

### Task 3

Next, there's a message that was sent on September 12th. I'd like you to find that message and let me know when you've found it.

`When they've finished...`

- In this scenario, who sent this message?

### Task 4

Okay, now, let's say that you have waited over a week now after sending this follow up question. Tell me what you would do next, if you felt you had waited long enough for the VA to reply back.

- Is there anything else on this page that could help?

[If they don't already suggest or notice it.] One thing you could do is send the VA another reply. Next, can you send the VA a reply?

`When they've finished...`

- [If they haven't already] You can hit send when you're ready.

## Reply (10 minutes)

> Screen: Reply confirmation page.

Okay, great.

- Before we talk about this page, how was that processing of sending a reply to the VA?

Next, I'll give you a minute to read through this page and I'd like to know if you have any questions about it.

`When they've finished...`

## Cool down (10 minutes)

[You can stop sharing your screen now if you'd like to.]

Awesome. We've finished reviewing the prototype.

Let's spend the last 10 minutes reflecting on that experience.

- First off, how was that for you?
- Was there anything particularly challenging about using your assistive technology to find or review past questions?
- What about replying to the VA?
- Did you encounter any unexpected behaviour at any point?
- Did you feel unsure at any moment about what to do next?
- Is there anything you would change about the experience?

Well, I think you've answered all of our questions.

Thanks again for sharing your time with us. It’s been so helpful to learn from you.

**Do you have any questions for me about Ask VA or this research?**

Okay, well thank you so much for the time.

Perigean will send you a thank you note with some information that you can pass along to other Veterans if they’d like to participate in future research sessions. 

I hope you have a lovely rest of the day.

## Pause or exit strategies

We can use this strategies to prepare for difficult situations.

### If the participant isn't using assistive technology

Thanks for letting me know. Unfortunately, this particular research study is focused on assistive technology. Since you don't use assistive technology, we'll have to end the session now. We'll hopefully see you back here again for another study. Thanks for your time!

### If the participant can't screen share after troubleshooting

I really appreciate your patience through this. I'm sure you know, it can be really frustrating when technology is not our friend. Since we're not able to set up screen share, we're going to end the session now. You're still going to be compensated for the full session. Thanks again for joining us and we'll hopefully see you back here again for another study.

### If the participant isn't feeling well

I'm sorry you're [not feeling well]. Do you feel up for continuing? You'll be paid even if we stop early.

> If they choose to continue...

Okay, just let me know if you change your mind.

### If the participant is showing signs of upset or distress

This sounds so hard. Would you like to take a break or stop?

> If they choose to take a break and come back...

Welcome back. I'm interested to hear more about [topic you left off on]. Are you up for continuing or would you prefer we move to the next topic?

### If the participant decides to stop

Thank you for your time today, I completely understand your decision to stop.

> If they seem distressed...

Before you go, the VA Hotline number is 988, it's a confidential helpline, and it's 24/7. It's up to you whether you call.

### If the participant is fine to continue, but you aren't

I hear that you're okay to continue. Before we do, I realized that I need a minute. I'm going to turn off my camera and microphone, and get a glass of water. Is that okay with you? I'll be back in 3 minutes.

> If you're still not able to continue, after you pause...

Thanks for letting me take a break. You didn't do anything wrong, but I'm realizing that I'm not going to be able to continue this session. You will still be paid for the full time. I really appreciate you sharing with me today. Is it okay with you if we stop? Thanks very much.
