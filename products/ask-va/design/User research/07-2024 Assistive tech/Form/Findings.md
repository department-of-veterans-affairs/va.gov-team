## Research goals

The key goal of this study is to:

* Identify any barriers that could prevent Veterans who use assistive technology from asking a question through Ask VA

## Research questions

* Are any headers, labels or links lacking description or clarity?
* Can Veterans interact with all elements using only their keyboards?
* Are click targets, hover states and labels of controls always available and clear?
* Are Veterans still oriented and able to use the form when magnified?
* Is it clear that information is pre-filled? Is it clear how to update pre-filled information?
* Can Veterans understand their progress through the form without visual cues?
* Should the progress bar heading be the first element in focus within the form?
* Are there any inconsistencies during the journey that present confusion?
* Do Veterans who use assistive technology feel they can ask a question without the support of another person?
* Does Ask VA need to change or evolve to offer an equitable experience? If so, how?

## Methodology 

We will run a moderated usability study remotely on Zoom. We will mock the sign in process, so participants don't have to sign in but we can test the authenticated experience.

## Hypotheses and conclusions

|Hypothesis|Conclusion|Explanation|
|:--|:--|:--|
|Veterans will think headers, labels and links are descriptive and clear.|Mostly True|Most headers, labels and links were descriptive and clear. But, there was some confusion between next and continue, to provide one example.|
|Veterans will be able to interact with all elements using only their keyboards or other devices.|True|Veterans were able to interact with all elements using their assistive technology.|
|Veterans will be oriented and still able to use the form when magnified.|Mostly True|Mostly, Veterans did not face any issues due to magnification. However, one person clicked continue instead of search due to magnification.|
|Veterans will understand that information has been pre-filled from 'their' account and know how to update it.|Sometimes True|Veterans were slightly confused by prefilled contact information, but this is also due to testing with mock data. We also didn't include a prefill alert, letting them know the information has been filled in already. People were sometimes not sure whether a field was filled already or not.|
|Veterans will understand their progress in the form with or without visual cues.|Mostly True|The visual aspect of the progress bar didn't provide any more description as to where you are in the form, so screen reader users had a very similar experience with the progress bar. There were mixed feelins on whether it was necessary but it didn't deter or confuse nearly anyone.|
|Sign in will be a barrier for some Veterans using a screen reader or magnification.|Not Enough Information|We mocked sign in for testing.|

## Key findings

1. Most Veterans can easily complete the form without help, but struggle to imagine using Ask VA over another tool.
2. The progress bar can be useful as a consistent anchor on each page.
3. People seek a specific category and topic, and they would find it easier to choose from shorter lists.
4. Some people click continue instead of search or next (page of results) instead of continue.
5. Veterans consistently misinterpret the military postal code checkbox and the additional info doesn't help clarify.
6. It's not always clear to screen reader users when information is prefilled in the form.
7. The review and submit page is repetitive, particularly for screen reader users.

## Details of findings 

### Finding 1: Most Veterans can easily complete the form without help, but struggle to imagine using Ask VA over another tool.

_Labels: `PRDT: AVA`, `AUD: Veterans`_

While most people can easily get through the form unassisted, a shorter form would be easier to complete.

Generally, Veterans are less frustrated by the length of the form now, but they consistently comment when they have to input their post code twice. 

They feel they may use Ask VA if they, "have more time" to wait for a reply or need to ask a simple question.

But for more specific and important questions, Veterans need to know who will be reviewing their question and rely on a quick reply.

> "I don't think [this would be usable on my phone]. There's too many questions to answer. [...] It's more practical [on] desktop."

> "Kinda tedious. There was an awful lot of steps to go through. [...] I don't have to go through a half a dozen pages to finally get my question submitted [through secure messaging]. I can just go in and click on, respiratory or whatever. I find that a lot easier."

> "I don't know who's answering on the other end [...] so the fact that I would [be] waiting 7 days for an answer that may not be right, would be very bothersome. [...] I'm struggling to see when I would actually use this."

### Finding 2: The progress bar can be useful as a consistent anchor on each page.

_Labels: `PRDT: AVA`, `AUD: Veterans`_

Screen reader users can use the progress bar as a landmark to figure out where they're starting on each page.

Most people don't have strong feelings about the progress bar and it may be unnecessary for a shorter form like the scenario we tested.

Slow incremental progress, followed by a large (specific) jump forward can be confusing.

It's helpful to be specific about number of questions or pages, but the percentage being so specific can actually be distracting.

In addition to sharing progress in the form, a time estimate helps set  expectations before you start.

> "It lets me know where I'm at. I'm at the beginning of that specific page and where I'm at in this process. That's because I'm blind, it gives me that anchor point."

> "I saw it jump from like one to 22 and that made me go, gosh! But that might hve been [...] a bug. I did pay attention to it [but] because of the jumps, I kind of dismissed it."

> "If there was something to say, like, this process [...] takes 1 to 2 minutes to complete, that would be good."

### Finding 3: People seek a specific category and topic, and they would find it easier to choose from shorter lists.

_Labels: `PRDT: AVA`, `AUD: Veterans`_

Many people are concerned they will choose the wrong category and topic for their question – and there's no validation.

Although people can choose a category and topic that works 'well enough', they're expecting options that aren't in the list, like, 'Durable medical equipment' instead of 'Prosthetics.'

It's usually easier to choose from broader options and shorter lists.

Screen reader users may not listen beyond the first 4 or so words in an option.

One person heard, 'death' when their screen reader announced 'debt.'

> "I'm not really seeing anything that pertains to me going to the VA and having an issue and needing to follow up. None of this is applicable."

> "If there's a list of options, how do I know I'm selecting the right option? For just the small percentage of us who are totally blind, I cannot read I gotta depend on my hearing. So, for me personally, that's the biggest, call it hindrance or frustration. It becomes overwhelming if you have a dozen items to choose from. If there's more than 6."

> "If you could say indebtedness or something like that, because I heard 'death' [instead of 'debt']."

### Finding 4: Some people click continue instead of search or next (page of results) instead of continue.

_Labels: `PRDT: AVA`, `AUD: Veterans`_

While magnified, one Veteran clicked 'continue' instead of 'search.'

This should trigger an error message asking you to search for your health facility, however, due to a bug they continued without picking a facility.

Similarly, a few Veterans confused 'next' and 'continue." This meant they navigated to the next page of results rather than the next page in the form. 

The words have a similar meaning and the actions are close together.

> "I tried clicking on [next] and it didn't do anything [...] Oh, it already selected what I needed, but it's just different options on this page..."

### Finding 5: Veterans consistently misinterpret the military postal code checkbox and the additional info doesn't help clarify.

_Labels: `PRDT: AVA`, `AUD: Veterans`_

The military postal code checkbox makes many people think they only need to provide their postal code if they live on a military base overseas. 

Which is especially confusing because the field is required.

The additional info component is very rarely expanded, and when it was, it didn't help clarify the confusion.

> "Veteran receives mail outside the US on a military base. That wouldn't be applicable to me, so, if something is not applicable but it's required, how do I continue?"

> "I don't receive anything outside the US [clicks continue] but yet they want a zip code."

> "Move this [Veteran receives mail] and this [Learn more about military base address] below [Postal code]. Because that gets confusing."

> "I would click on 'Learn more about military base addresses.' [Expands additional information component.] So, that does me no justice."

### Finding 6: It's not always clear to screen reader users when information is prefilled in the form.

_Labels: `PRDT: AVA`, `AUD: Veterans`_

Pre-filled form fields should announce that they've already been filled.

Otherwise, people assume they're not filled, attempt to fill them in and add to what's already there.

This is compared to showing the pre-fill pattern up front (before the form starts), which people consistently understand.

We plan to include an alert on pages that have been pre-filled, but it wasn't included during this testing.

> "I would just be like, this is the contact information we have for you. Would you like to make any changes?"

### Finding 7: The review and submit page is repetitive, particularly for screen reader users.

_Labels: `PRDT: AVA`, `AUD: Veterans`_

The review and submit page is repetitive for multiple reasons.

Firstly, people have already reviewed information that was prefilled in the form, like their phone number.

The headings can be labels redundant too, for example, 'Your relationship to the Veteran,' is followed by, 'What is your relationship to the Veteran?'

In other cases, people were confused by how long it takes for them to hear their question read aloud, after hearing the heading, 'Your question.'

Also, the edit alert sometimes announces itself over and over.

> "It's really repetitive at this point. It's absolute redundancy of lunacy right now. I'd be frustrated to no end at this point."

> "It was prefilled. I reviewed it once. Why am I reviewing it again?"

## Additional insights

- There's a known bug where updates on the review page are triggering success messages on multiple, unrelated fields.
- Error messages are triggering early on radio buttons when using keyboard navigation.
- Focus behavior for groups should be consistent, and it should be clear when something is a group of radio buttons or checkboxes.
- It may not be clear to people that when they want to read the reply, they should sign back into VA.gov.

## Recommendations

- Remove postal code when we collect health facility
- Make it easier to distinguish between 'next' and 'continue'
- Remove US military postal code option if there's not impact on routing
- Move question to it's own accordion at the end of the review page
- Fix success message on the review page
- Add content to the confirmation page that explains signing back in if you're authenticated
- Add general time estimate before you start a new question
- Investigate error messages triggering early with keyboard navigation

In the future:
- Make the progress bar less specific and/or jump less at a time
- Plan discovery to better understand how Ask VA fits in with other VA tools
- Limit number of categories and topics allowed, add word counts and descriptions
- Plan card sorting and/or tree test exercise to re-design category and topic lists
- Design a short version of form and test

## Underserved groups we haven’t talked to 

We have completed the [VA Recruitment Checker for Equality](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?gid=1967698004#gid=1967698004).

This study focused on AT. We had 1 session cancelled due to no AT and one no-show. We exceeded our target of 6 complete sessions and finished with 10 complete sessions. I've noted AT use above based on which AT participants said they use, however, we had 4 participants who did not go through the test on their AT. 1 participant couldn't share their screen and we switched to a QA session due to too many technical difficulties. 3 other participants did not use the AT during the test. All 3 stated that they didn't feel the need to use it, but would be more likely to use their AT if the form was more text-heavy and/or longer.
