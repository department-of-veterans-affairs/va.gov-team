## Intro (5 minutes)

> Start transcript: `LIVE TRANSCRIPT` > `ENABLE`.

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Tyler]. How are you?

I’m a researcher from VA. I work on improving VA.gov so it's easier for Veterans to contact VA online if they have a question.

My colleague is also here. They're an accessibility specialist and they're here to support you and I during this conversation.

> Accessibility specialist says hello.

**What I hope to do today** is get a sense of how we can make this process better.

**What I don't want to do** is add to any frustration that you've had with contacting VA in the past. I want to be up front and say that I don't have a way of fixing those past experiences. But, I do want to know about your frustration in case there's things we can improve in the future.

Before we get started, I just want to confirm a few things.

- Do you use a [tool] to access websites or applications?
- Which tool are you going to use today?

### Troubleshooting: If they're not using assistive tech
- We'll politely end the session. Refer to [pause and exit strategies](#pause-or-exit-strategies).

Okay great. Moving along, we have a few other people in the waiting room who might observe this session. They'd like to join to listen in, learn and take notes.

**I want to confirm now, are you okay with a couple of my teammates joining us to quietly observe?**

- `IF NO` Use Slack to let observers know.
- `IF YES` They're in the waiting room, so I'm going to let them into the meeting now.

> Let in observers from the waiting room.

Welcome. This is [participant].

Let's go around and say hello, starting with ____.

**Thanks everyone, now I’ll ask you to turn off your cameras and mute yourselves for the rest of the session.**

There are a few other things I want to mention before we start:

- **This session could take up to...**
   - Screen reader or alt navigation –– an hour and a half
   - Screen magnification –– an hour
   - I’ll make sure we finish on time, so I may occasionally move us along during the session, so we can cover everything.
- **We’re here to learn your honest opinions.** Negative feedback is helpful too, because it helps us learn how we can improve.
- **I also want to make it clear that we’re not testing your ability.** So, for example, if I ask if you understand something, it’s because I want to make sure the description is clear.
- **I’m going to share a prototype with you today.** This is like a test version of VA.gov. You're also going to sign in using a test account. This means, that we'll be using pretend information today. So the prototype won't have any of your actual data, like your name or Social security number.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, you just have to let me know.** And that might be a pause to get some water or to stop the session completely. You'll be paid even if we don't complete the full session.
- The last thing is about recordings. We can record the session to help us confirm we captured your opinions accurately and sometimes share video clips with our colleagues at VA. If we do this, we don’t link anything you share in the session to any information that could identify you. We remove your face and your name from the videos. **Knowing this, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
  - `IF NO` Don't record
  - `IF YES` Once I start recording, I’ll confirm again.

> Start recording: `RECORD TO CLOUD`.

I’ve started recording. I'd like to confirm again: **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?**

## Warm up (5 minutes)

It seems like we’re ready to get started. I'd like to begin by learning more about your experience with the VA and our online services.

- I'm curious, how long have you been a Veteran?
- Have you ever contacted the VA online or over the phone?
  - `IF NO`
    - Why might you contact the VA?
    - If you were going to contact the VA, would you prefer to call, go online or get in touch another way?
  - `IF YES`
    - Can you tell me about a time when you contacted the VA?
    - How do you usually contact the VA? Why?
    - How was the support you received?
- Have you ever heard of Ask VA?

Okay, great. Thanks for sharing that with me. It's helpful to know a little bit about how you've contacted the VA in past.

I'd also like to know a little more about how you're using your assistive tech.

- How long have you been using [tool]?
- How often do you use [tool]?
- What device are you using today? [Desktop, mobile, tablet, Mac, Windows, Android?]

<details>
  <summary>Key things to notice</summary>

- Why do they choose to contact VA (instead of going elsewhere or doing another task)?
- How do they decide which channel to use when they contact the VA?
- Are they familiar with Ask VA?
- How do they rate their experience level with their assistive tech?
- How often do they use their assistive tech?

</details>

## Set up (10 minutes)

- Have you ever shared your screen on Zoom while using [tool]?

Okay, great. We're going to do that now. 

- [Have they shared before?]
  - `IF YES` Please share your screen when you're ready.
  - `IF NO` I’ll help guide you through how to share your screen...

### Troubleshooting: Screen share issues
- If testing on VoiceOver (Mac), tell participants to navigate to "Share" (tab or they can do shift + command + S). Then, once they choose "Share," they need to share sound. They should tab until they hear "Share sound" and then check on. Then, choose, "Share" again to finish.
- Refer to [Screen reader instructions: Setting up screen share](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/screen-reader-instructions-and-troubleshooting-dur#Screenreaderinstructionsandtroubleshootingduringresearch-Settingupthescreenshare).
- Ask the accessibility specialist to come off mute and assist.
- Be patient. Reassure the participant that this can be confusing and we're here to work through it together.
- If after trying everything, screen share still isn't working: We'll politely end the session. Refer to [pause and exit strategies](#pause-or-exit-strategies).

> Screen sharing starts.

Thanks! Now I’m able to see your screen. I see [describe window].

Next, I'm going to share a link to the test website.

- Would you prefer that I email you the link, send it in the Zoom chat or dictate it to you?

> Dictate, email or send link in chat: [https://bit.ly/ask-va](https://bit.ly/ask-va).

<details>

  <summary>Suggestions for link sharing</summary>

- On JAWs, (Windows), dictate or email may be best.
- On TalkBack, (Android), share in the chat if typing is blocked.
- On TTS/Voice Command (Mac iOS), chat may be best. Or, if they aren't sure how to switch between applications, dictate.
   
</details>

> Opens staging. On the dashboard.

## Dashboard (10 minutes)

So, today we're going to observe as you navigate this website. 

Before you start, I'm going to share some context with you.

This is a tool called Ask VA. It's a way for Veterans to contact the VA and ask a question online. For today's session, we're going to pretend like you're asking the VA a question about a recent experience you had a VA medical center. I can remind you of the scenario whenever you need me to.

And as you navigate, we want to understand what's going through your mind and how your assistive technology is supporting you. When you start the form, I'm going to stay quiet, so you can focus on the task [and what your screen reader is announcing]. [If we can't hear their screen reader eg. on mobile, tell them that.]

It's helpful if you pause every once and a while and call out things that are surprising, confusing or helpful. 

- How does that all of that sound for you?

Okay, great.

So, let's get started. Instead of making you sign in today, we're going to imagine that you signed in and pretend like this is your account.

And when you're, please navigate to submit your question to the VA.

> Screen: Dashboard (Authenticated)

> Starts a new question...

<details>
  <summary>Key things to notice</summary>

- How do they navigate through the page elements?
- Are there any areas or components they struggle to interact with?
- Are all interactive elements properly labeled and announced?
- Is the tab order logical and easy to follow?
- Where did they pause, if at all?
- Was their next step clear?
- Is there any assistive tech behaviour you need them to explain, for example, what their screen reader announced on a particular element?

</details>

- How do they navigate through the page elements?
- Are there any areas or components they struggle to interact with?
- Are all interactive elements properly labeled and announced?
- Is the tab order logical and easy to follow?
- Is it useful to have the first element in focus be the progress bar, or, should it be the page title?
- Can they edit on the `Review and submit` page without issue?
- Where did they pause, if at all?
- Was their next step always clear?
- Is there any assistive tech behaviour you need them to explain, for example, what their screen reader announced on a particular element?

</details>

## Cool down (10 minutes)

[You can stop sharing your screen now if you'd like to.]

Awesome. We've completed the form [or we're getting close to the end of our session, so let's stop here].

Let's spend the last 10 minutes reflecting on that experience.

- First off, how was that for you?
- Was there anything particularly challening about using your assistive technology to submit this form?
- Did you encounter any unexpected behaviour at any point in the form?
- Did you feel unsure at any moment about what to do next?
- Is there anything you would change about the experience?

(If it's not covered yet) I have a specific question about the first element in focus on each page. Every time you navigated to a new page, the first element in focus is the heading that tells you what percentage complete you are with the form. For example, 20% complete with form.

- Did you find this helpful?
- Is there another heading that you think could be a better first element in focus as you enter a new page?

<details>
  <summary>Key things to notice</summary>

- How was their experience completing this form with assistive tech?
- How, if it all, does Ask VA need to evolve to provide a more equitable experience?
- Were there any areas or components they struggle to interact with?
- Were all interactive elements properly labeled and announced?
- Was the tab order logical and easy to follow?
- Is it useful to have the first element in focus be the progress bar, or, should it be the page title?
- Was their next step always clear?
- Is there any assistive tech behaviour you need them to explain, for example, what their screen reader announced on a particular element?

Well, I think you've answered all of our questions.

Thanks again for sharing your time with us. It’s been so helpful to learn from you.

**Do you have any questions for me about Ask VA or this research?**

Okay, well thank you so much for the time.

Perigean will send you a thank you note with some information that you can pass along to other Veterans if they’d like to participate in future research sessions. 

I hope you have a lovely rest of the day.

## Pause or exit strategies

We can use this strategies to prepare for difficult situations.

### If the participant isn't using assistive technology

Thanks for letting me know. Unfortunately, this particular research study is focused on assistive technology. Since you don't use assistive technology, we'll have to end the session now. We'll hopefully see you back here again for another study. Thanks for your time!

### If the participant can't screen share after troubleshooting

I really appreciate your patience through this. I'm sure you know, it can be really frustrating when technology is not our friend. Since we're not able to set up screen share, we're going to end the session now. You're still going to be compensated for the full session. Thanks again for joining us and we'll hopefully see you back here again for another study.

### If the participant isn't feeling well

I'm sorry you're [not feeling well]. Do you feel up for continuing? You'll be paid even if we stop early.

> If they choose to continue...

Okay, just let me know if you change your mind.

### If the participant is showing signs of upset or distress

This sounds so hard. Would you like to take a break or stop?

> If they choose to take a break and come back...

Welcome back. I'm interested to hear more about [topic you left off on]. Are you up for continuing or would you prefer we move to the next topic?

### If the participant decides to stop

Thank you for your time today, I completely understand your decision to stop.

> If they seem distressed...

Before you go, the VA Hotline number is 988, it's a confidential helpline, and it's 24/7. It's up to you whether you call.

### If the participant is fine to continue, but you aren't

I hear that you're okay to continue. Before we do, I realized that I need a minute. I'm going to turn off my camera and microphone, and get a glass of water. Is that okay with you? I'll be back in 3 minutes.

> If you're still not able to continue, after you pause...

Thanks for letting me take a break. You didn't do anything wrong, but I'm realizing that I'm not going to be able to continue this session. You will still be paid for the full time. I really appreciate you sharing with me today. Is it okay with you if we stop? Thanks very much.
