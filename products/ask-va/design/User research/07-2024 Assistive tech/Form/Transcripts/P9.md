Tyler: Thank you, [P9].

4
00:00:13.876 --> 00:00:20.759
Tyler: Okay, that was a lot of information and a lot of different people. Do you have any questions for me? At this point.

5
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.530
> P9: No, ma'am.

6
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:23.390
Tyler: Okay.

7
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.892
Tyler: I think we're ready to get started.

8
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:35.410
Tyler: I'd love to learn just like a little bit more about your experience. As a veteran and interacting with the Va. How long have you been a veteran.

9
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.420
> P9: 2,006.

10
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.259
> P9: It was 18 years.

11
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.590
> P9: Okay.

12
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.150
> P9: yeah.

13
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.289
Tyler: And did you start interacting with the Va right away, right when you got out of service.

14
00:00:50.020 --> 00:01:02.760
> P9: I did. Well, I've been interacting with the Va. While I was in service, or I had a break in service back in the eighties, and I used the Va. Back then. For educational purposes.

15
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.820
Tyler: Okay.

16
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.599
> P9: And

17
00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:08.969
> P9: and then I use the Va. As soon as I get out in 2,006.

18
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.740
Tyler: and when you.

19
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.150
> P9: For my.

20
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.730
Tyler: The

21
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.270
Tyler: for your health, care.

22
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.980
> P9: And education. Yeah.

23
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:16.590
Tyler: Okay.

24
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:17.560
Tyler: got it

25
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.159
Tyler: when you contact the Va, how do you usually get in touch

26
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.370
Tyler: with the Va.

27
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:30.260
> P9: I either call or send secure messaging or work on my healthy vet. I do a lot of my healthy vet work.

28
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:31.160
Tyler: Okay?

29
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.839
Tyler: And on my healthy vet, what sorts of things are you? What sorts of like tasks are you doing.

30
00:01:40.376 --> 00:01:46.786
> P9: the medication I ask for medication. I ask for renewals of medication.

31
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.660
> P9: I

32
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:55.023
> P9: ask my doctors for referrals if I need to or just questions.

33
00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.469
> P9: I just spent almost 2 years

34
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.730
> P9: with the patient advocate.

35
00:02:01.274 --> 00:02:06.735
> P9: And my doctor is trying to get a treadmill, and that was mostly done through

36
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.039
> P9: secure messaging.

37
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.889
Tyler: Okay.

38
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.240
Tyler: got it, and how.

39
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.710
> P9: And I.

40
00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.449
Tyler: Are you finding secure, messaging.

41
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.679
> P9: Well, I love the the concept

42
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:26.819
> P9: of it that I can send emails in my records and documents, and they can send me documents that way.

43
00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:48.123
> P9: it's a little cumbersome, because you can only send it to one person. You can't send an EI can't send an email to my primary care, my patient advocate, my, this coordinator, you know, or 2 doctors that I'm asking to confer on. I can't. I can't do that. I can only send it to one person at a time.

44
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.940
> P9: and it's just yeah, it's

45
00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:01.880
> P9: it's hard and you can't. And if even if you know somebody's email, you can't really send it. You have to be their team, and things like that.

46
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.929
Tyler: Yeah, that's a really good point. I never thought about that. How you can't send things to multiple the same thing to multiple people

47
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.669
Tyler: very easily.

48
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:24.410
Tyler: That makes sense. When you're using secure messaging. I know you said you're kind of swapping between. You know, you have some vision. Sometimes you're using voice over what do you feel like you're usually doing when you're on secure messaging?

49
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.559
Tyler: If you can remember.

50
00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:27.339
> P9: I

51
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.380
> P9: I navigate it with my mouse, because

52
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.590
> P9: still isn't easy to get to.

53
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:45.769
> P9: the screen. And if I'm on my phone. It's even harder to get to compose a message or read a message. And sometimes you hit secure messaging.

54
00:03:46.960 --> 00:04:01.960
> P9: And it says, Okay, this is what secure messaging is about. It doesn't take you to your inbox or anything else, and you've got to navigate all over the place to find that stuff. So it isn't very intuitive. There isn't an easy way to write the email quickly, and

55
00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:07.650
> P9: there it. And it's hard also to understand the

56
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.560
> P9: the addresses.

57
00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.260
> P9: because I work with 4 different vas right now.

58
00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:16.640
> P9: I,

59
00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:40.169
> P9: I did a class, an online class with [location], so they're now listed in my emails and my [location] and [location], and then [location], and all of these different people are there, and the acronyms they use make it really hard to find your doctor or your social worker, or you know your this coordinator. So.

60
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.710
Tyler: Yeah. Oh, yeah, I could definitely see that and it's interesting the way you brought up

61
00:04:45.196 --> 00:04:53.279
Tyler: sometimes you arrive. And it's just a page that's about secure messaging. It's not actually the place where you're going to send a message.

62
00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:54.110
> P9: Right.

63
00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.749
Tyler: Which makes sense, and also.

64
00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:03.530
> P9: Often getting back home, and I and I often hit the home button just to be able to find secure messaging again.

65
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:12.549
> P9: or my lab results or my cause. I have a I'm on a medical study. So I'm constantly sharing results.

66
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:18.070
> P9: And I need the results. And that's hard to find, too, in the blue button report.

67
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.070
> P9: Try just trying to navigate to

68
00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.220
> P9: Make sure that the date is right

69
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.910
> P9: on

70
00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:33.280
> P9: when you're getting your blue button messaging. You know your reports.

71
00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.949
> P9: It's just difficult.

72
00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:43.659
> P9: because they have a custom option, and then you have to go into the calendar and you have to change the year and this and that, or try to type it in properly.

73
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:45.390
> P9: So.

74
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.889
> P9: yeah. And then you have to make sure, even though you've changed the date.

75
00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.920
> P9: You have to press the custom button.

76
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.109
> P9: because it'll ignore the dates if you don't press the custom button so.

77
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.479
Tyler: Right? Okay, interesting.

78
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.349
Tyler: I'm curious. Have you? Have you ever used a tool called? Ask Va.

79
00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.230
> P9: Is that inside of my healthy vet, or on what? On the website.

80
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.610
Tyler: It's actually separate. It's a separate Va website.

81
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.180
Tyler: Right now. No, okay.

82
00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:30.189
Tyler: that's no problem. So that's what we're going to be talking about today. So I'll share a little bit more about what ask? Va is, once we get set up on the website. But that's really helpful background just to know how you're contacting the Va right now.

83
00:06:30.541 --> 00:06:43.779
Tyler: And we already kind of started talking about this about your assistive technology setup and kind of how long you've been using the tool. And you said, I think in the last about 4 years you've been starting to rely on voice over a little bit more.

84
00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:46.149
Tyler: Yeah. And we talked about your.

85
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:51.019
> P9: I learned it. Yeah, I learned it 4 years ago. I took a class, but

86
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:56.880
> P9: you know I didn't. I didn't use it constantly. So you keep forgetting, and I keep going back to

87
00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:59.839
> P9: my guides and things like that.

88
00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.779
Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

89
00:07:02.274 --> 00:07:09.220
Tyler: And you're on a desktop with a monitor. What? What browser do you usually use.

90
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.879
> P9: I usually use chrome.

91
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:12.640
Tyler: Chrome. Okay, cool.

92
00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:19.679
Tyler: Maria. Did you have any other questions about the the tech setup that [P9]'s using right now?

93
00:07:21.515 --> 00:07:27.619
Maria: Yes. So to confirm. It's Mac. Sorry it's voice over on Mac on chrome.

94
00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:29.000
> P9: Yes.

95
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:30.569
Maria: Sounds good.

96
00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.839
> P9: And I have a track pad.

97
00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.490
> P9: you know, a separate track pad and a

98
00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:46.089
> P9: and I can use the keys also, but I find them a little bit

99
00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.300
> P9: more difficult to use, so.

100
00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:50.350
Maria: Understandable, understandable

101
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:53.369
Maria: right. I've got all of that down.

102
00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.224
Tyler: Awesome. Thanks, Maria.

103
00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:13.719
> P9: You don't have a good. They're constantly going. Well, try this one. Try this one. Try this one, you know. Keep trying it until it works, and then, after 5 of those sessions, or 5 of those things where you know they go. Well, try the the voice over, shift

104
00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:17.389
> P9: down, try the voiceover. Shift space bar. Try this.

105
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:21.301
> P9: You've you completely. You can't learn that way. So.

106
00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:29.090
Maria: I completely feel that. If you ever get into like using braille keyboards. Oh, my gosh! That's the one that I really like using.

107
00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.309
Maria: I can't remember the.

108
00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:30.830
> P9: Oh, okay.

109
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:32.429
Maria: I would highly recommend that.

110
00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:34.159
> P9: Okay.

111
00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:37.980
> P9: I have to learn the brown language

112
00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:43.150
> P9: target once, okay.

113
00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:52.019
Tyler: Alright, so let's go ahead and get ourselves set up. Sharing your screen on Zoom. Have you done that before, [P9].

114
00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:53.075
> P9: Yes.

115
00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:59.199
Tyler: Okay, so we'll give you a moment to share your screen, and if you need any help, just let me know.

116
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:05.820
> P9: Okay, it's there we go. The green button in the middle. Boom, my

117
00:09:07.175 --> 00:09:08.220
> P9: screen.

118
00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:11.470
> P9: Okay.

119
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.620
Tyler: Okay, perfect. So now I can see your screen. It looks like it says, Zoom.

120
00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:34.829
Tyler: So the next thing we're gonna do is go on to this test website. So I can either send you a link to the website in the chat on Zoom, or if you want to just open a new tab. I can see you're already on chrome. Then we can type it in.

121
00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.229
Tyler: and it's a short link.

122
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:39.040
> P9: Can. Okay,

123
00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:42.040
> P9: not going to use my voice over now

124
00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.170
> P9: just yet. I'm gonna

125
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:46.930
> P9: you'll see me moving my head closer

126
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.909

131
00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:01.690
Tyler: Okay, so it's bit BIT.

Tyler: Dot.

135
00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:11.960

> P9: LY.

138
00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.400
Tyler: Forward! Slash!

139
00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:20.120
> P9: Flash.

140
00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:23.159
Tyler: Ask like a S. And K.

141
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:23.820
> P9: Okay.

Tyler: Dash

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:27.509
Tyler: like a hyphen.

144
00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.210
> P9: Hyphen.

145
00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:30.929
Tyler: VA.

146
00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:33.089

> P9: perfect.

148
00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:40.440
> P9: No idea Bitly was still around. Okay.

### Form

149
00:10:40.730 --> 00:11:03.679
Tyler: Yeah, it's very helpful. To have a shorter link. So there we go. We're set up. We're on the test website. So I'll tell you more about what we're doing today before we start going. So I said we were going to be looking at a tool called, ask Va, so that's where we are now. And ask, Va is a way for veterans to contact the Va online. If they have a question.

150
00:11:04.188 --> 00:11:10.880
Tyler: Okay in today's session. We're going to be pretending like you have a question that you need to ask the Va

151
00:11:11.199 --> 00:11:15.099
Tyler: we're gonna say, it's a question that's related to your health care. Okay?

152
00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:15.800

349
00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:42.929
Tyler: So just then was the issue like it was difficult to get into the radio button group.

350
00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:43.920
> P9: Yes, it was.

351
00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.449
Tyler: Stuck about that yet.

352
00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:53.399
> P9: It was. It was, yeah. I was kind of getting stuck in that search bar. I got there, but getting out of it was a little bit difficult.

353
00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:53.850
Tyler: Yeah.

354
00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:54.340
> P9: So.

355
00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:54.760

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:56.079

358
00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:04.069

360
00:27:07.936 --> 00:27:11.639

361
00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:14.749
> P9: It's not kicking you back 5 pages.

362
00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:19.529
> P9: But this is kind of complicated. Just to ask a question. Okay.

363
00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:24.140
> P9: it's a lot easier to go. Okay.

364
00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:26.239
> P9: option. Yeah.

365
00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:27.370
Tyler: Yeah, so

366
00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:42.137
Tyler: that makes sense. You're you're finding the form. I think you mentioned it earlier already. You said this question feels unnecessary. And now you're in this field where you're having to search for a health facility, and that feels like a lot to ask a question. Which makes sense.

367
00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:51.510
Tyler: It felt straightforward for you to know that you should put in your postcode here and to search. It was just getting down to the results right.

368
00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:54.380
> P9: Well, I heard it. I I did hears

369
00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:57.939
> P9: postal code. So I knew to, you know, type that.

370
00:27:58.330 --> 00:28:02.750
> P9: Okay, I've heard postal code. So I just started typing postal code.

371
00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:08.910
> P9: I don't even think I could see. You know, it wasn't even on my screen, because it was being hidden by some other buttons. So I just

372
00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:13.040
> P9: you know I'm using voiceover. I can't see it. So

373

> P9: Can you? Heading level your contact information?

380
00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:48.940
> P9: Yes, yes, ma'am.

381
00:28:49.240 --> 00:29:00.110
Tyler: Yeah, sorry. Can we pause just for a second here? You am. I correct in thinking, like you heard how far along you are on the form, and then you were like, Oh, my gosh! This is a lot to ask a question.

382
00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:01.460
> P9: Yes.

383
00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:02.310
Tyler: Okay?

384
00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:11.409
Tyler: And were you reacting specifically to realizing how far along you are in the form or just the fact that it's like you've went through all these pages.

385
00:29:12.743 --> 00:29:16.800
> P9: I was reacting to the fact that I wasn't far along in the form at all.

386
00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:19.360
> P9: That it was only 21%.

387
00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:21.049
Tyler: Gotcha. Okay. Cool.

388
00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:25.189
> P9: I can see that in the corner of my eye there's a red bar.

389
00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:25.990
Tyler: Okay.

390
00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:27.910
> P9: I don't know what that means.

391
00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:28.410
Tyler: Got it.

392
00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:41.430
> P9: You know it does. Is it going to turn green at the end? Does it turn yellow? You know that kind of thing? So? But yeah, it's like 21%. And I'm thinking also 21 is an odd number to have.

393
00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:50.819
Tyler: Yeah, yeah. So it wasn't just like your experience of going through the pages. It was also hearing 21%. And you're like, Oh, my gosh.

394
00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:55.150
> P9: Yeah, the numbers. The numbers are very odd. It's not 5, 1020. It's

395
00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:57.729
> P9: they're very specific numbers. So.

396
00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:01.270
Tyler: Gotcha. And then that's also interesting. The way you pointed out, like

397
00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:04.970
Tyler: out of the corner of your eye you can see this red bar

398
00:30:05.342 --> 00:30:08.158
Tyler: and you're not exactly sure what that means.

399
00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:15.449
> P9: I know I would. I would have quit this already. I would I would have quit. I picked up the phone and called the Va.

400
00:30:16.004 --> 00:30:19.745

401

> P9: tech photography, a number.

407
00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:57.680
Tyler: So I see now. It's it typed in what you said to me out loud.

408
00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:00.909
> P9: You are currently on a tech control. I'm sorry. What was that.

409
00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:03.079
Tyler: That's okay. I can just see. Now.

410
00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:05.119
> P9: I think what happened was

411
00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:09.240
> P9: I hit my my my button to

412

> P9: You guys from talking.

414
00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:29.539
Tyler: No, that's okay, and don't worry about. I know it's like inevitable that we might interrupt each other and or the screen, reader. So I'm trying my best not to do that. But it's oh, totally fine! If you interrupt me or can't hear me. It sounds like.

415
00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:30.040
> P9: Orthodox.

416
00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:31.259
> P9: My girl.

417
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:46.300
Tyler: It. It seems like you expected to put in text or put in your phone number, I should say. And then you said aloud, oh, is it already in there? So was it not clear that there was already a phone number in the field?

418
00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:47.600
> P9: No.

419
00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:48.010
Tyler: Okay.

420
00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:53.669
> P9: Because the phone number. And then I I just knew that I had to start typing

421
00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:55.870
> P9: the next one.

422
00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:56.960
Tyler: Right?

423
00:31:57.540 --> 00:31:58.860
Tyler: That makes sense.

424
00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:25.367
Tyler: So yeah, that's not clear. It should normally announce to you that it was pre filled. But it wasn't announced. So to you it was just blank. And you put in your phone number. And I'll give you a little more context. That's because, in theory, you're signed into your account right now. So it's pulling in your phone number. But obviously, if you, if it didn't announce that, how would you know that it's pulled in your phone number. So that makes sense.

425
00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:36.080
Tyler: I think it's gonna it might get confused now, because there's such different like characters in that field, and it won't let us continue.

426
00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:36.900
> P9: I mean, I need to do.

427
00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:38.120

> P9: Okay.

433
00:32:49.210 --> 00:32:52.239
> P9: yeah. I don't think it did announce that it was there. Did it.

434
00:32:52.240 --> 00:33:08.439
Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. That's also, I think Maria also noticed that it wasn't announced. So that makes sense. That's good for us to know. Go ahead and and continue on this page. There's another field below phone number, and that's also Pre filled. And then after that, you can keep going.

475
00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:24.459
Tyler: Right? Okay? So there's 2 things that are confusing. One is that you've started to learn like, okay, fields are pre filled. So I should expect my postcode to be here. But then it's not here. And you're like, Okay, now, I just really don't know what's pre filled.

476
00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:25.650

482
00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:40.190
Tyler: Right.

483
00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:41.540
Tyler: I would. So that's.

484
00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:47.250
> P9: I guess my own one, because it says it's required. So something has to go in there.

485
00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:48.790
Tyler: Right? Okay?

486
00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:50.530

00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:51.380

490
00:36:54.700 --> 00:37:15.549
Tyler: That's okay. I was just reiterating because there's a checkbox that says veteran receives mail outside of United States on a Us. Military base. It's making you feel like this is for people to put in a postcode if they live outside the Us. On a military base which you don't. Yeah. But then you also were like it's required. So I guess I'll put in my own postcode.

491
00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:24.020
> P9: Yeah, yeah, if that were switched around, it might be better, because I don't think it's going to change the answer, because they're all 5 digit codes. Anyway.

492
00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:25.190

00:44:39.130 --> 00:44:47.039
> P9: read the last thing that I put, and you know, if I'm not comfortable with my navigation, I'm thinking. Oh, I've jumped back.

589
00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:57.700
> P9: you know. Let me keep moving forward, and then I'm not listening, cause I'm trying to get to where it was before option, and I haven't heard these before. So option. Edit your contact information, button.

590
00:44:57.700 --> 00:44:58.430
Tyler: Yeah.

591
00:44:58.430 --> 00:45:00.390
> P9: You are currently on a button to

00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:05.850
> P9: definition list, 16 items option. You are currently in a definition list.

594
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:25.340
> P9: you are cutting the level 4, your postal code.

595
00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:27.710

596

> P9: Option

597
00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:33.090
> P9: option.

598
00:45:33.090 --> 00:45:33.790
Tyler: Okay.

599
00:45:33.790 --> 00:45:41.189
> P9: Button. Okay, you are currently on a button definition list. One item, definition list, 2, postal code control. Oh, did you have something to say.

600
00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:53.460
Tyler: Oh, no! I was just wondering. So going through that page that was really helpful feedback. 1st off the bat, which was, you expect this to be in the order of the questions. Is there anything else you were noticing, as you were navigating through this.

601
00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:55.539
> P9: It was just

602
00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:59.588
> P9: very familiar for the things that

603
00:46:01.776 --> 00:46:05.150
> P9: you know that, I put in. And again, if they're pre-filled.

604
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:06.540
> P9: it just

605
00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:11.240
> P9: seems silly at this point, but you could change the number that you want.

606
00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:13.300
> P9: you know. Yeah, I guess

607
00:46:13.310 --> 00:46:14.690
> P9: you're asking it.

608
00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:15.870
Tyler: Yeah, yeah.

609
00:46:17.162 --> 00:46:19.840
> P9: But yeah, it's just. It's just odd

610
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.950
> P9: and disorienting

611
00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:23.760
> P9: when they change the order.

612
00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:29.290
Tyler: Yeah, I totally get that. And then the other thing you pointed out, I just want to make sure that was captured is like

613
00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:33.209
Tyler: you've already reviewed this pre-filled information.

614
00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:37.349
Tyler: And now you're reviewing it again, which yeah, seems a little bit silly.

615
00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:44.789
> P9: That's what I yes, that's what I was trying to say, is I? It was pre filled. I reviewed it once. Why am I reviewing it again?

616
00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:47.470
Tyler: Right totally, that makes sense.

617
00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:57.889
> P9: And it would [postal code] end of definition. Lit end of definition. List back, button group. Submit question. Button. Okay, am I ready? You are currently on a button.

618
00:46:57.890 --> 00:46:59.170
Tyler: Yeah, to, just.

619
00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:04.779
> P9: Hep Main. Your question was submitted successfully. Group control.

620
00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:06.050
> P9: Okay.

621
00:47:06.050 --> 00:47:06.530
Tyler: Awesome.

622
00:47:06.530 --> 00:47:08.920
> P9: Your question end of your your

623
00:47:09.370 --> 00:47:12.680
> P9: now, what I don't know at this point is.

624
00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:16.200
> P9: I think I think I asked for a phone call?

625
00:47:17.476 --> 00:47:19.050
> P9: Okay? So

626
00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:37.450
> P9: option. And of your question, your confirmation number is a 123,456, 7,890. We'll also send you an email confirmation. You should receive a reply by phone call within 7 business days. If we need more information to answer your question. We'll contact you. Link, return to ask. Va.

627
00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:42.330
> P9: you are currently on Link. I have to tell you. I would be so disappointed at that point.

628
00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:47.689
> P9: It's only just a question that you would take a whole week to get back to me.

629
00:47:47.690 --> 00:47:48.430
Tyler: Yeah.

630
00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:49.190
> P9: So.

631
00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:54.820
> P9: But that's me. I'm I'm used to, you know, getting on the Internet Googling. I've downloaded

632
00:47:55.050 --> 00:47:58.410
> P9: the whole the Va

633
00:47:59.528 --> 00:48:10.050
> P9: guide for educational benefits that the Va counselors used. I mean, I downloaded that, and that's how I get my questions and answered. So

634
00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:12.040
> P9: I

635
00:48:12.810 --> 00:48:14.310
> P9: I'm somebody who's.

636
00:48:14.350 --> 00:48:18.060
> P9: you know, looks for regulations and laws and things.

637
00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:18.890
Tyler: Yeah.

### Cool down

00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:36.909
Tyler: well, I mean, I I think that's really understandable. And it was very obvious, almost from the beginning, that you were gonna find this process like a bit annoying because you expected it to be so quick like you thought I'm gonna get to this 1st page. And the 1st thing you said to me was, Okay, cool. I'm just gonna look for the place to type in my question.

639
00:48:36.930 --> 00:48:46.750
Tyler: And then it was all these pages, so it didn't meet your expectation, which makes sense, and you're not the only one who feels that way. So we totally recognize that

640
00:48:47.035 --> 00:48:55.249
Tyler: and I know you get to this point. And then you find out it's been. It's gonna take 7 business days, and that probably just adds to sort of the frustration.

641
00:48:55.250 --> 00:48:57.839
> P9: And what happens if I don't answer the phone.

642
00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:01.430
> P9: Call, because I don't know what number they're calling from.

643
00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:02.810
Tyler: Right, yeah.

644
00:49:03.383 --> 00:49:06.249
> P9: You know. So yeah, it's

645
00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:12.989
> P9: it just seems very silly. And I could go on bard or chat Gpt, and probably.

646
00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:14.030
Tyler: Yeah.

647
00:49:14.170 --> 00:49:17.690
> P9: Let's ask AI and get a quicker answer.

648
00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:36.409
Tyler: Yeah, yeah, I get that. And I think, I think at 1 point you noted that like, Google was a bit easier than this so that makes sense. I think like, especially when we think about general questions like, if we wanted to ask the Va like

649
00:49:36.973 --> 00:49:54.359
Tyler: you know what like date? Do I need to have left service in order to be eligible for Gi. Bill benefits? That's probably something that chat. Gbt. Google, all these other things could answer for us pretty quickly. Right? But

650
00:49:54.680 --> 00:50:03.340
Tyler: what if it was like a really specific question for your situation? So you were like, I am [P9], and I've had this specific thing happen. And I need to ask

651
00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:07.970
Tyler: this specific person a question about it like, what would you do in that case.

652
00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:10.340
Tyler: and it might not be used. This.

653
00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:16.770
> P9: Well, I like. I wanted to know who the service dog champion was for a Va.

654
00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:20.500
> P9: And a service dog. Champion is the person who's

655
00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:23.090
> P9: like the main person responsible for.

656
00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:27.230
> P9: Accessibility for service dogs in the A. Building.

657
00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:28.810
> P9: and I just

658
00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:32.880
> P9: got a hold of that building, and I asked the operator.

659
00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:35.799
> P9: And you know they had no clue.

660
00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:38.810
> P9: and they had no clue and no clue. And I ended up

661
00:50:42.590 --> 00:50:44.440
> P9: emailing the patient advocate.

662
00:50:45.330 --> 00:50:46.120
Tyler: My health.

663
00:50:46.330 --> 00:50:50.270
> P9: And I got an answer back. I I would usually call

664
00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:54.299
> P9: or send emails.

665
00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:54.950
Tyler: Yeah.

666
00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:56.439
> P9: I I

667
00:50:56.900 --> 00:51:06.240
> P9: can't imagine that this I I don't know who's answering. I don't know who's on the other end. Looking at these questions and trying to figure out the answer.

668
00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:07.370
> P9: And

669
00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:13.869
> P9: you know it took them, and they had to go through 4 different people inside the Va.

670
00:51:14.190 --> 00:51:18.860
> P9: Just to find me the answer because one person answered it, and it wasn't right.

671
00:51:19.390 --> 00:51:23.140
> P9: and so I can't imagine. If they give me the wrong answer.

672
00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:27.560
> P9: Am I going to go through this process again.

673
00:51:29.048 --> 00:51:39.200
> P9: You know, asking the Va. Because somebody gets it and they go. Oh, that would be, you know, this person. They sent me to prosthetics, and I'm going. No, that's not the right person.

674
00:51:39.370 --> 00:51:43.490
> P9: and you know those people wouldn't even call me back because they didn't know what I was talking about

675
00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:45.590
Tyler: Right.

676
00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:50.650
> P9: So I I would find this waiting 7 days for an answer.

677
00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:52.310
> P9: That may not be right

678
00:51:52.770 --> 00:51:55.429
> P9: would be very bothersome to me.

679
00:51:56.070 --> 00:52:12.799
Tyler: Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense, especially cause I say, like, Okay, what if you had a really specific question? And your 1st instinct is to find, like a specific person to talk to. And this isn't specific. You've just submitted a form, and you don't know who's gonna answer it.

680
00:52:13.110 --> 00:52:13.530
> P9: Right.

681
00:52:13.530 --> 00:52:16.920
Tyler: I can see how that would be like. It's not the best option for you.

682
00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:19.350
> P9: And I waited 7 days for an answer.

683
00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:26.750
> P9: And I call, you know, and they give me the a point of contact. And it's not the right point of contact, because.

684
00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:27.280
Tyler: Yeah.

685
00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:33.339
> P9: I don't understand how the Va. Is really organized, or something like that, and I may not be asking the right question.

686
00:52:34.250 --> 00:52:36.229
> P9: You know you. You have to

687
00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:40.049
> P9: learn to ask the right question in order to get the right answer.

688
00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:47.600
Tyler: Right? Yeah, that's a really good point. I mean overall that that all makes a lot of sense to me.

689
00:52:48.570 --> 00:52:53.839
Tyler: I wonder like going through the form, thinking maybe less about, like

690
00:52:54.260 --> 00:53:06.029
Tyler: the purpose of this tool, and how useful it is. Cause I think we've kind of determined that. But but more so thinking like just filling out a form, using voice over, how was that experience for you?

691
00:53:09.850 --> 00:53:10.610
> P9: it.

692
00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:15.689
> P9: I think again, as we discussed it, was longer than it

693
00:53:16.250 --> 00:53:17.590
> P9: needed to be.

694
00:53:18.279 --> 00:53:21.149
> P9: There was a little bit of redundancy.

695
00:53:22.410 --> 00:53:23.299
> P9: The

696
00:53:24.690 --> 00:53:26.760
> P9: and then the toolbar at the top.

697
00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:38.329
> P9: you know, going. You're thinking that every time there's a new thing on a new question on here the toolbar is only going to go up by increments of 3 or 4%,

698
00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:41.249
> P9: and then from 24 to 90

699
00:53:41.695 --> 00:53:47.794
> P9: girls like, Wait, this is this is just too much. I'm gonna quit already.

700
00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:57.340
Tyler: Yeah, you really, you really noticed that because you were even, you were noticing it enough that you could even tell me like, Oh, I've only went 3% on this page.

701
00:53:57.570 --> 00:53:59.310
> P9: Yeah, right? And yeah, so

702
00:53:59.330 --> 00:54:00.125
> P9: the

703
00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:02.250
> P9: the

704
00:54:04.100 --> 00:54:07.570
> P9: you did all of that work to type in

705
00:54:08.070 --> 00:54:11.150
> P9: 10 words, you know, is my question.

706
00:54:11.410 --> 00:54:14.570
> P9: And now I have to wait 7 days for an answer.

707
00:54:15.086 --> 00:54:20.660
> P9: and I'm wondering why my information is so important to them.

708
00:54:21.664 --> 00:54:24.980
> P9: I mean, I'm already signed into my account.

709
00:54:27.070 --> 00:54:33.989
> P9: So why would I be? Why? Why are they asking all these other questions?

710
00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:35.450
Tyler: Yeah.

711
00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:37.510
Tyler: It's almost.

712
00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:41.300
> P9: Generic question, then it shouldn't matter who I am.

713
00:54:42.050 --> 00:54:42.740
Tyler: Yeah.

714
00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:44.730
Tyler: so

715
00:54:45.310 --> 00:54:51.905
Tyler: go ahead. That makes that makes total sense. To me, it almost feels like there's 2 problems like, one problem is

716
00:54:52.690 --> 00:54:57.909
Tyler: like going through the form and having to give more information than you expected to.

717
00:54:57.960 --> 00:54:59.809
Tyler: And the other problem is

718
00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:01.440
Tyler: how long you have to wait.

719
00:55:01.770 --> 00:55:10.709
Tyler: So like if we had to say, You know, in this world? We are only able to fix one of these problems like, we can make this form shorter

720
00:55:11.322 --> 00:55:17.970
Tyler: and we ask you less questions upfront, or we can make the waiting period shorter. What do you think you would choose.

721
00:55:19.660 --> 00:55:21.490
> P9: Make the waiting period shorter.

722
00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:22.500
Tyler: Yeah.

723
00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:29.789
> P9: I mean, because when you compare the 2 times I mean.

724
00:55:30.130 --> 00:55:36.359
> P9: you know, let's say that I got used to this and in I could fill it out in 6 min.

725
00:55:36.510 --> 00:55:39.070
> P9: I'm still waiting 7 days for an answer.

726
00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:39.920
Tyler: Yeah.

727
00:55:40.185 --> 00:55:50.519
> P9: Well, how much are you gonna shorten it? If it takes me? If it takes me 15 min to fill it out, you're just gonna shorten it to 5 min. I'm only saving 10 min. But if you can

728
00:55:50.670 --> 00:55:54.019
> P9: shorten the answer, I'm saving days. Yeah.

729
00:55:54.380 --> 00:55:55.060
Tyler: Yeah.

730
00:55:55.190 --> 00:56:07.039
Tyler: I think that's a really helpful point, because it's really easy to say, like, let's just make this form shorter. But if you have to wait 7 days. It didn't really help you as much as making that waiting period shorter.

731
00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:09.980Maria
Tyler: So that's that's really helpful.

732
00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:27.250
Tyler: I think. I think you've answered all of my questions at this point. It's been really, really helpful. I'm going to give Maria a chance in case there's anything else that she wanted to touch on. Maria, did you want to share anything, or or ask any other questions?

733
00:56:28.550 --> 00:56:42.029
Maria: No questions. I just wanted to make a comment. I completely understand your frustration with this form. As a native user of technology as someone who has to use. Like, you know, screen readers like 24, 7. It's quite

734
00:56:42.660 --> 00:57:12.120
Maria: cumbersome having to run through like a bunch of like, you know, content and form fields, and you know there's a page before. But you know the continue button, or whatever it might the component was called, is at the end of the contents. If you want to go back, that means that you're running through the form fields and the headings just to go back through that page, and while you could like Alt left arrow back, or try to do that sometimes, if you do that on a specific form, it'll take you to the previous page and not to the page of that form. Do you know what I mean?

735
00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:18.589
Maria: Yes, exactly. Yeah. I completely understand your frustration. And the waiting period.

736
00:57:18.890 --> 00:57:28.160
> P9: Yeah. And the screen, reader is, you know, you can only take so much verbal information in a day. You can't.

737
00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:34.239
> P9: you know it's it's not the same as as visual. You have to stop with the noise at some point so.

738
00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:34.610
Tyler: Yeah.

739
00:57:34.610 --> 00:57:35.730
Maria: Absolutely

740
00:57:36.107 --> 00:57:43.834
Maria: that's why I am, or whenever it is that you want to pick up braille, which I which I highly recommend, I think just because I used to teach it.

741
00:57:45.180 --> 00:57:48.550
> P9: Oh, I will, because I can't take the noise all the time. I.

742
00:57:48.810 --> 00:57:49.500
Maria: No either.

743
00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:53.598
> P9: Quiet, so eventually, when I stop working, I'll I'll pick up brow.

744
00:57:54.850 --> 00:57:57.540
Maria: Agreed. Agree that would that would be quite nice.

745
00:57:57.860 --> 00:58:02.580
Maria: It's so much easier to read something from a braille display when it comes to like really specific

746
00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:09.379
Maria: like questions like that. And like, really specific inputs instead of like listening to it. Because when you listen to it, you know, that can be like a jump of anything.

747
00:58:09.530 --> 00:58:10.130
> P9: Yes.

748
00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:16.760
> P9: and I'm a i'm a big, you know. I used to be a big scanner where it's like, no, no, you know, I just needed to see one word, or

749
00:58:17.070 --> 00:58:21.440
> P9: you know, you could look at the page upside down and know what it was saying. So

750
00:58:21.630 --> 00:58:22.650
> P9: now it's

751
00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:34.413
> P9: and then, you know, because there's so many headers, and this and that, it just becomes a little bit cumbersome, and and the sections of the forms

752
00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:40.060
> P9: just add to the length of it. When you have to navigate through each one of them.

753
00:58:41.070 --> 00:59:04.960
Maria: Absolutely. And sometimes, if you're like, not only just going through the form, but say, you have like like, I don't know what could be universal, like Whatsapp or telegram or whatnot. Sometimes, if a message comes in, it'll like your voice or voice over will just pop the like, focus over there. And you. That means you have to go back and get the focus back in the form that's not guaranteed that you're gonna be sent back to the exact form field that you're in.

754
00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:06.190
> P9: Exactly.

755
00:59:07.570 --> 00:59:12.435
Tyler: Can I ask a quick question to to [P9] or Maria? You're both welcome to comment.

756
00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:23.950
Tyler: Have you ever used things like Chat bot, or like a little like live chat. Where you talk to someone back and forth on a website and like, have any thoughts on that experience.

757
00:59:25.483 --> 00:59:26.270
> P9: I have

758
00:59:27.223 --> 00:59:39.920
> P9: and it depends on on what it is, you know. Sometimes I think they're just being intrusive, and I don't need it. I'm just looking for one specific piece of information. But I've

759
00:59:40.250 --> 00:59:42.189
> P9: I've used the chat bots before.

760
00:59:43.770 --> 00:59:48.300
> P9: Sometimes they're good and easy, but as AI improves it gets better.

761
00:59:50.650 --> 00:59:58.330
Maria: Likewise, I was gonna say, I try not to use chat bots just because there can usually be like really weird focus behavior, like.

762
00:59:58.330 --> 00:59:58.840
Tyler: Say.

763
00:59:58.840 --> 01:00:08.340
Maria: Like, say, like something comes from the chat box, but from the chat. But but I'm not aware of it, because I have to like go back like visually backwards, to go.

764
01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:08.740
Tyler: Hmm.

765
01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:12.550
Maria: And the focus. Sorry. Just go have the focus be on their message.

766
01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:19.580
Maria: and then I have to go navigate forwards to get back to whatever message I want to edit and send over to them.

767
01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:22.719
> P9: Be typing another message

768
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:28.819
> P9: as they're typing their message. And so you're constantly yeah, the focus just keeps shifting.

769
01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:38.309
Maria: And then if there's a loading indicator sometimes it won't tell you like one if it's there or 2 when it's completed. Like loading.

770
01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:45.581
Maria: So you're just kind of sitting there blissfully unaware that something has occurred, and then Chat bot goes, and

771
01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:47.210
> P9: Anybody there? Yeah.

772
01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:49.593
Maria: Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, basically.

773
01:00:50.070 --> 01:00:57.760
> P9: Waiting 5 min, and you get up to do something else. And then you don't realize that they said something to you. And they, you know they're already gone.

774
01:00:58.530 --> 01:01:02.959
Maria: Yeah, it just completely expires the session on its own, and then you have to go through it again. That's.

775
01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:03.840
Tyler: To.

776
01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:08.509
Maria: I just honestly, I just as a blind person I like to just call.

777
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:15.440
Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. I hadn't thought about the focus behavior, but that makes so much sense the way you both described it.

778
01:01:15.690 --> 01:01:22.459
> P9: And and I have to tell you the Va operators are. They're multitasking people. They're not.

779
01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:22.820
Tyler: Not just.

780
01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:25.520
> P9: Operator to find a phone number for you.

781
01:01:25.810 --> 01:01:26.860
> P9: They can.

782
01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:33.279
> P9: They can make appointments and cancel appointments right there. So I

783
01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:36.810
> P9: I oftentimes just call the Va. Operator.

784
01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:38.010
Tyler: Yeah.

785
01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:49.379
Tyler: that makes sense. I can like completely understand why calling would be easier, especially when you're not exactly sure how well the tech is going to work with. With your assistive technology, it makes complete sense.

786
01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:50.060
Tyler: And

787
01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.629
> P9: And the other thing. This is that.

788
01:01:53.880 --> 01:02:00.710
> P9: for for example, when I was going, it wasn't healthcare. But when I was going through the educational process.

789
01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:03.479
> P9: With the Va.

790
01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:11.770
> P9: I I signed up for one program because I thought, that's what I wanted to do. And then I get the counselor, and he's like.

791
01:02:12.430 --> 01:02:20.250
> P9: no, this is a different program. So I'm I'm you don't even know what questions to ask. Somehow.

792
01:02:21.350 --> 01:02:24.189
> P9: You know, I'm interested in educational benefits.

793
01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:31.760
> P9: Well, okay, there's all different kinds of educational benefits. And if you're not asking the right question.

794
01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:33.190
Tyler: Yeah.

795
01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:39.690
> P9: It. You just end up wasting everybody's time. Yeah, wasting 7 days for an answer

796
01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:41.005
> P9: is.

797
01:02:42.510 --> 01:02:46.279
Tyler: Yeah, you mentioned that earlier, too. That idea of like.

798
01:02:46.490 --> 01:03:07.330
Tyler: it's on the user or yourself in that scenario. To make sure you're asking a good question in order to get good answers. Do you think on a phone it's just different, because it's more conversational like, someone can say, but what about. Have you thought about this? Versus like, when you're using something online.

799
01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:09.450
Tyler: like, what makes it different

800
01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:10.829
Tyler: in terms of

801
01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:14.119
Tyler: worrying less about asking the right question.

802
01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:19.819
> P9: In terms of the phone versus.

803
01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:22.700
> P9: Versus this or.

804
01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:23.540
Tyler: Yeah.

805
01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:30.599
> P9: well, with the phone, you're you're usually going to get resolved within minutes.

806
01:03:32.010 --> 01:03:34.589
> P9: And they can often help you

807
01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:36.719
> P9: with the right language.

808
01:03:37.530 --> 01:03:47.379
> P9: So I'm looking for the service dog things. Oh, well, prosthetics does that? I said, no, that's not the right program, you know. It's this or that, and

809
01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:52.540
> P9: and you can usually, you know, negotiate with the person to find the right words.

810
01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:59.240
> P9: The other thing about this, and I was just noticing the confirmation number.

811
01:03:59.790 --> 01:04:05.330
> P9: What do I do with the Confirmation number? If it's been 7 days, and I don't have an answer. What do I do?

812
01:04:06.430 --> 01:04:07.310
Tyler: yeah.

813
01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:10.316
> P9: What do I do?

814
01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:25.369
Tyler: Yeah, I'm gonna do the annoying thing I did earlier and not answer your question yet. But where? Where would you think like at this point. You're on the success, you know. You've successfully submitted your question, Page, and it gave you a confirmation number.

815
01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:31.309
Tyler: Where would you expect to come back and find your response. In 7 days.

816
01:04:32.248 --> 01:04:39.590
> P9: Obviously, in my email emailed to me. But maybe there's some place in my account

817
01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:43.720
> P9: okay, and exists with an answer. But I wouldn't know that.

818
01:04:43.950 --> 01:04:44.270
Tyler: Okay.

819
01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:47.489
> P9: And maybe there is a place in my account

820
01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:48.840
> P9: to.

821
01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:50.969
> P9: But I don't. I I

822
01:04:51.010 --> 01:04:58.519
> P9: I don't know to go back and take my confirmation number and go back and ask the Va. Hey? I put this in. Where's my answer?

823
01:04:58.930 --> 01:04:59.750
Tyler: Yeah, from.

824
01:04:59.750 --> 01:05:03.420
> P9: Days ago, and then waiting another 7 days for

825
01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:05.570
> P9: a response.

826
01:05:05.570 --> 01:05:06.310
Tyler: Yeah.

827
01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:13.099
Tyler: that makes sense. And since we're getting to the end of our session, I'll I'll kind of explain how it would work. So

828
01:05:13.665 --> 01:05:30.580
Tyler: you'd get to this page. It would give you a confirmation number, and then you'd get sent an email confirmation as well, which would pretty much say what this page says, it would say. You submitted a question. Thanks. Here's your confirmation number, and in 7 days, or or hopefully, less than

829
01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:46.759
Tyler: someone would get back to you with a reply, and you would receive an email from the Va. Saying, we've replied to your question, and you would have to sign into va.gov, and then read their reply. So you wouldn't actually get it through email.

830
01:05:47.894 --> 01:05:50.939
Tyler: so that's how it would actually work. But I think.

831
01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:53.959
> P9: Are you serious? Are you serious?

832
01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:59.170
> P9: Oh, my God! Oh, my God! And so they're asking me, how do I wanna

833
01:05:59.290 --> 01:06:02.369
> P9: be notified? Is it notified, or get my answer?

834
01:06:02.815 --> 01:06:04.410
> P9: It's how should we call it?

835
01:06:04.410 --> 01:06:05.250
Tyler: Talk to you,

836
01:06:05.530 --> 01:06:18.039
> P9: How should we? Yeah, that's right. So in my head, I'm thinking they're contacting me with the answer by phone or by email. But in reality. Somebody is either going to text me or call me and say

837
01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:22.200
> P9: your answer. We've answered you log back in to find it.

838
01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:22.950
> P9: Yeah.

839
01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:23.560
Tyler: So, if the.

840
01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:25.150
> P9: That makes me angry.

841
01:06:25.410 --> 01:06:35.969
Tyler: Yeah, yeah, no, I'm I mean, I'm I. I can see how it doesn't meet what you expected. And if if I had chosen to be.

842
01:06:35.970 --> 01:06:37.000
> P9: Call me.

843
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:37.570
Tyler: Yeah.

844
01:06:37.570 --> 01:06:38.200
> P9: Absolutely.

845
01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:49.480
Tyler: If you chose to be called to be fair, they would tell you over the phone. They would say, this is your reply, or whatever. But you also could come back into Vagov and see the written reply.

846
01:06:49.690 --> 01:06:50.180
> P9: Oh! So!

847
01:06:50.180 --> 01:06:51.770
Tyler: So it's a little different.

848
01:06:51.770 --> 01:06:54.950
> P9: Carson, it would. Would it be a machine reading the answer to me.

849
01:06:54.950 --> 01:06:56.529
Tyler: Oh, no! It would be a person.

850
01:06:56.890 --> 01:06:57.710
> P9: Oh, okay.

851
01:06:57.710 --> 01:07:09.440
Tyler: Yeah, phone call would be a little bit different. But email, like the Va wants to keep everything secure. So they want to be able to keep all the messaging on va.gov. But I think, regardless. What we've noticed here is like.

852
01:07:09.540 --> 01:07:25.430
Tyler: maybe we should make it more clear to people that on this page. When you get a reply from the Va. You're going to sign back into Vagov to read the reply. So you know, I know that that might still be annoying, but at least in that case you would be aware.

853
01:07:25.430 --> 01:07:27.769
> P9: Okay? And you know, there's also, like

854
01:07:27.990 --> 01:07:31.540
> P9: they have a 24 h hotline, where you can just call a nurse and ask them.

855
01:07:32.186 --> 01:07:33.479
Tyler: Oh, yeah.

856
01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:36.680
> P9: You know I'm I'm struggling to see when I would actually

857
01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:38.160
> P9: use this.

858
01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:38.930
Tyler: Yeah.

859
01:07:39.070 --> 01:07:46.219
Tyler: which is really helpful feedback. That's why we said at the beginning, like negative feedback is helpful, because we want to better understand, like.

860
01:07:46.240 --> 01:08:00.745
Tyler: what is the use of this tool? And like, why would people use it? And how well would it work if they used it? And things like that. So it's been a really really helpful almost hour and a half. I think you've answered all of my questions.

861
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:03.470
Tyler: and I really appreciate you.

862
01:08:03.470 --> 01:08:04.080
> P9: What is overall.

863
01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:05.095
Tyler: Us.

864
01:08:06.190 --> 01:08:17.499
Tyler: I also really appreciate Maria jumping in to help when we need it, and and asking good questions as well. And everyone else on the call, I'm sure. Echoes my! My gratitude to you.

865
01:08:17.987 --> 01:08:21.559
Tyler: Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up [P9]?

866
01:08:21.779 --> 01:08:23.079
> P9: No, ma'am, I'm good.
