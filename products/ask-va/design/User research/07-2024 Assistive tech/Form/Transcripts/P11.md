### Warm up

Thomas: Okay. So I've started the recording. And just one last time I'd like to confirm again, are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio. As we talk today.

> P11: Yes.

3
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:14.370
Thomas: Fantastic.

4
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.486
Thomas: Alright. So

5
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:28.139
Thomas: Just as a a little bit of background information. We'd like to learn a little more about you before we begin. I'm curious. How long have you been a veteran?

6
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:29.780
> P11: Oh, well.

7
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.710
> P11: I did 23 years between active duty and Navy reserves.

8
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.300
> P11: so I guess I'm a veteran. Since the time I joined.

9
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.690
> P11: which been [date] 1985.

10
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:42.080
Thomas: Okay.

11
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.449
> P11: And I retired in 2008, officially.

12
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.070
Thomas: So you started in 1,985 and retired in 2008.

13
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.820
> P11: Correct.

14
00:00:51.820 --> 00:01:01.979
Thomas: Okay, fantastic. And have you like, since you've retired? Have you ever contacted the Va online or over the phone?

15
00:01:02.586 --> 00:01:03.800
> P11: Daily, Daily.

16
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.780
Thomas: Okay. Well.

17
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:19.270
> P11: I was big daily. But I I checked the website daily. And in the past 4 years I've more. I've gone through quite a bit my disability. I've had several disabilities while I was in the service, but

18
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:30.770
> P11: I I never applied for disability. I was didn't know about it, and and you know I it's starting to affect me a lot. And so I got a really good Va. Rep here in [location], where I go to

19
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.010
> P11: this got me from 20 to 60. Now, up to 70%.

20
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.180
Thomas: Oh, wow!

21
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:42.253
> P11: 2 pending claims as well, and one just got denied for the second time. So we're seeing how it goes.

22
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.290
> P11: and so. But yeah, so I'm constantly checking my

23
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:54.289
> P11: disability status. And I I go to Va for my health care and everything else. So mostly with the with the Va. For everything.

24
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.189
Thomas: Okay? So with

25
00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:09.689
Thomas: the the way that you contact the Va through like with regards to your status in your healthcare. What is it through my healthy vet that you normally contact the Va.

26
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.620
> P11: Yes, that. And the Va website, just the main website.

27
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.220
Thomas: Okay.

28
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:24.910
> P11: Health bet just strictly for my appointments and things like that. But if I go through the Va website, I can access the health that as well.

29
00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:25.695
Thomas: Okay.

30
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:34.829
Thomas: could you tell me a little bit about your experience about how? How was the support that you received.

31
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.629
> P11: From the Va. Health care, or.

32
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.110
Thomas: Yeah, yeah, sure like that. That might be an example. That would be a great example.

33
00:02:41.433 --> 00:03:06.006
> P11: It was great. It's great! I mean. And and fortunate here in the city of [location], where I live. It's got a brand new Va health clinic. I mean, it's 5 times the size of the older one, and it's it's massive. And the you know, I'll get treated respectfully there, and once once I got from went from 20 to 60%, I no longer have a copay and anything, and

34
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:13.650
> P11: they always take good care of me. The only problem is, typically, when I got something major done, I always got to go to [location].

35
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.360
> P11: and it's not an hour drive to [location].

36
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:26.169
> P11: but with the new Va. Health Center that just opened here in July, I think for some minor surgeries and things like that, I won't have to go to temp anymore. So I'm kind of excited about that.

37
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.310
> P11: We have, like some monstrous new Va health clinic here in [location], [location], where I live.

38
00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:48.069
Thomas: Oh, that's fantastic to hear. It's it's always wonderful to hear when somebody says that they've received a great support, and especially for all the improvements that are that are in your area to where you don't have to drive as far. That's that's fantastic.

39
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.749
> P11: I got a I got a I'm really thankful that I got a very good.

40
00:03:51.860 --> 00:04:01.829
> P11: a Va. Rep that's in [location]. He is just outstanding. He just really takes care of us. He always prepares me, you know, for the C. And P. Exams, I always have to go to.

41
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.200
> P11: and

42
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.770
> P11: he's he's he's been. He's been tremendous. He's fantastic. He's an army reserves, retired.

43
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:09.410
Thomas: Maybe.

44
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.409
> P11: He knows this stuff, and I've been thankful for that as well. So I've been blessed that.

45
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:41.890
Thomas: That sounds like it. That's that's great. So I thank you for sharing that bit of information for with us. And so I also want to know, because as you're going online checking the website, little, I'd like to know a little bit more about the assistive tech that you're using. How long have you been using the screen magnification tool.

46
00:04:42.445 --> 00:04:44.665
> P11: Probably since 2020,

47
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.419
> P11: 2020 had stopped work.

48
00:04:50.200 --> 00:05:00.249
> P11: I had detached retina surgery. I attached retina marina. I actually had it twice, and and the second time put me out of work forever. I haven't been in work since then.

49
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:01.284
> P11: and

50
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.209
> P11: and it really had a hard time for the longest time.

51
00:05:06.123 --> 00:05:07.490
> P11: Seeing anything

52
00:05:08.111 --> 00:05:12.680
> P11: and and so pretty much since then

53
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.749
> P11: had I've had 8 eye surgery since 2020

54
00:05:16.305 --> 00:05:20.189
> P11: with their financial crisis for a long time.

55
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:24.370
> P11: or finally got. It took me 2 years to get social security disability approved.

56
00:05:24.911 --> 00:05:30.150
> P11: So it it's been a struggle, but I've been doing fine the last couple of years. That's a

57
00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.960
> P11: got va disability in tupa

58
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:50.259
> P11: up top of my social security disability. So I'm doing okay. Now. Luckily, it's just me and my cat. So I ain't got a wife or kids anymore. So we're good, but pretty much since then, I just and but I I don't need it as so much as I used to. I had cataract surgery in my left eye.

59
00:05:50.280 --> 00:06:03.590
> P11: and that helped that problem. So I got pretty good size side of my left eye. For the most part I'm 2025, 2020 sometimes that left eye, so I have pretty good vision. At least one good eye for the most part.

60
00:06:04.122 --> 00:06:07.779
> P11: And so but yeah, the screen magnification helps you with focus.

61
00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:14.499
> P11: I don't have a problem so much on my cell phone. If I could read my cell phone with reading glasses pretty well.

62
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:20.129
> P11: It's some. It's the staring at a computer screen for extended period of time it gets to be very difficult.

63
00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.580
Thomas: Okay, that makes sense. Yeah.

64
00:06:24.822 --> 00:06:35.149
Thomas: So for today, we're gonna be looking as I'd mentioned, we're gonna be looking at a prototype. And will you be so are you gonna be using your desktop computer? Then.

65
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.149
> P11: I am right now. I'm talking to you on it. So obviously so. Yeah, that's

66
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.100
> P11: his little laptop.

67
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:44.570
Thomas: And if you don't mind me asking what browser do, do you normally use.

68
00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:45.490
> P11: Just

69
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.360
> P11: Microsoft edge. I guess it is. Now.

70
00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.130
Thomas: Okay.

71
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:50.850
> P11: Moving forward. So yeah.

72
00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:57.160
Thomas: All right. So I'm going to have you start sharing your screen? Have you done that before?

73
00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.056
> P11: I've done it. Yeah,

74
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:11.120
Thomas: Okay. So what I'm gonna have you do is start sharing your screen. And if you could bring up your your web browser. And I'm gonna give you, then, a a website address.

75
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.709
> P11: Okay, I gotta figure out how to minimize this screen here.

76
00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:14.450
Thomas: Okay.

77
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:16.180
> P11: Let me see here.

78
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.620
> P11: Exit full screen.

79
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.989
> P11: Okay, I guess we're getting there.

80
00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.929
Thomas: Should be a green button down towards the bottom.

81
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:31.999
> P11: Oh, okay. Share. Yeah.

82
00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:39.240
> P11: Okay.

83
00:07:40.166 --> 00:07:41.079

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:48.879
> P11: You're still there.

86
00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.320
Thomas: Yep. Still here. Yep.

87
00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.400
> P11: Can't see anymore.

88
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:52.360
Thomas: Oh, it's okay.

89
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:53.850
> P11: What I did here.

90
00:07:59.919 --> 00:08:02.439
> P11: I'm I'm not sure when we're sharing or not.

91
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:08.070
Thomas: Not yet. I still see you so it it might oh, looks like we're starting

92
00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.460
Thomas: started to share the screen.

93
00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:14.930
> P11: Okay.

94
00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:20.251
Thomas: Yep, there we go! I see it. Fantastic.

95
00:08:21.993 --> 00:08:28.230
Thomas: Shane! Would you want me to dictate the website address? Or do you want me to put it in the zoom, chat.

96
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:37.990
> P11: that would probably be good. I I got my browser up. What's the website?

97
00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:40.029
Thomas: Okay. You want me to say it to you.

98
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.660
> P11: Yeah, that's fine. Let me get my sight. My glasses on.

99
00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:50.729
Thomas: Okay, yeah, perfect. It's very. It's it's very short. Okay? So BIT, as in bit.

100
00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:52.770
Thomas: Period

101
00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:56.110
Thomas: LY,

102
00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:00.490
Thomas: and then slash forward, slash!

103
00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.730
Thomas: There you go, and then ask

104
00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.500
Thomas: hyphen or dash

105
00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:10.200
Thomas: VA

106
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.860
Thomas: perfect and go and hit, return.

107
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:25.280
> P11: I have a very. This is like an 8 year old computer. So I apologize. It's slow.

108
00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.639
Thomas: That's okay. That's not a problem at all.

109
00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:32.790
> P11: And now you're garbled.

110
00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:46.859
Thomas: I will kind of wait until things on your end kind of like, load up, and then hopefully, that won't garble my speech.

111
00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:49.010
> P11: Yeah, okay.

112
00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:54.819
Thomas: Alright perfect we are where we need to be to begin the prototype.

113
00:09:55.170 --> 00:10:01.380
Thomas: Okay, so I'm going to give you a little bit of context about what we're what we're seeing here. Okay?

114
00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:11.059
Thomas: So today we're gonna observe. And you, as you navigate through, ask, Va, have you ever heard of? Ask Va before?

115
00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:12.550
> P11: I have. I've heard of it.

116
00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:13.580
Thomas: Have you? Okay?

117
00:10:14.172 --> 00:10:18.607
Thomas: So right now. There's a sub domain of

118
00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.099
Thomas: is all of a sudden I can never read.

119
00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:27.629
Thomas: I'm always trying to remember what the actual website is on the current site.

120
00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:31.480
Thomas: and

121
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:51.200
Thomas: I think it's ask.va.gov, so that's normally where folks might go to for ask. Va, so this one is, we're working to rework. Ask Va. And to making it hopefully more friendly usable especially for folks who are using assessive technology as well.

122
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.080
> P11: Okay.

### Form

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:56.489
Thomas: So. It's a it's a way for for vet. Have you ever used Ask VA before?

124
00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:58.050
> P11: I don't believe I have.

125
00:10:58.050 --> 00:10:59.939
Thomas: Okay, so.

126
00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:01.430
> P11: I don't think I ever used it.

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:18.805
Thomas: Okay, alright. So it's a way for veterans to contact the Va and ask a question online. Now for today's session, we're gonna pretend, like you're asking the Va. A question about a recent experience that you've had at a Va medical center.

128
00:11:19.515 --> 00:11:31.520
Thomas: And I can remind you, as we as we kind of go through this about the scenario whenever you need me to. But as you navigate through, just if if you can remember to like talk aloud.

129
00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:46.609
Thomas: like to hear what you're thinking about, as you see the pages, but mostly what I am going to be doing is just kind of like being quiet in the background, and observing how you ask your question. If you don't mind.

130
00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:47.270
> P11: Sure.

131
00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:47.775
Thomas: Okay.

132
00:11:48.360 --> 00:12:10.420
Thomas: alright. So let's so let's go ahead and get started. And so instead of making you sign in we're just imagining that you've signed in. And now pretend like this is your account going forward and and as you're thinking through this, you're just looking to navigate, to submit a question on ask Va, so go ahead and start.

133
00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:13.380
> P11: Okay? So okay.

134
00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:17.850
> P11: ask a question right on. See? I can't see the White Arrow too. Well.

135
00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:18.420
Thomas: Oh, okay.

136
00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:19.070
> P11: Really.

137
00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:22.229
> P11: But hold on, hold on! I think I got it now.

138
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:28.200
> P11: because it's the same size as a screen. I I have to really work the mouse to try to find it.

139
00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:28.940
Thomas: Okay.

140
00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:34.489
Thomas: So so just to let you know Shane.

141
00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:57.910
Thomas: for some sometimes in our zoom, it will show us exactly how you see it, even if it's zoomed in. So what's interesting for us is that we don't see how zoomed in you are so as much as you tell us that that feedback right there about the Arrow was really fantastic. So anytime that you can let us know how you're seeing the screen really will help us out.

142
00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:05.709
> P11: Right? Right? It's bright white in the background. So like, I said, it matches the screen color. So I have to search for sometimes, you know. Okay.

143
00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:13.029
> P11: okay? And good. Yeah, I guess. Okay, I'm I'm pretending. That's my account. Obviously, sex academy.

144
00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:16.610
> P11: Okay, maybe something like,

145
00:13:19.156 --> 00:13:20.529
> P11: see? Here.

146
00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:28.319
> P11: decision reviews and appeals. I've got 2 pending, so maybe it's something like that. Oh, you said healthcare.

147
00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:34.159
Thomas: Yeah, go ahead. And I, yeah, go ahead. Because in our prototype

148
00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.530
Thomas: some of the categories may not

149
00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.470
Thomas: show up correctly.

150
00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:41.260
> P11: That's fine!

151
00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:42.660
Thomas: Okay. Great.

152
00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:47.910
> P11: And I guess I would be interested in

153
00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:49.290
> P11: yeah

154
00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:52.050
> P11: current meds.

155
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:58.709
> P11: actually, none of these categories were.

156
00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:00.219
> P11: I'm looking for

157
00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:06.979
Thomas: Tell me a little bit about that, as far as what? What are you looking for?

158
00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:15.899
> P11: Well, I'm not sure exactly, but I was thinking, I see a local podiatrist at the Va. Health. You know. There's a problem last 3 months.

159
00:14:16.285 --> 00:14:34.299
> P11: See, I was seeing a Podiatrist at the [location] Center, and they had mold issues, and they shut down the [location] Va. Center because of that, and said we we had to wait, you know, 3 months till the New [location] Va. Center opened, or go to [location].

160
00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:52.700
> P11: and my problem with my foot wasn't so bad that I was going to drive back and forth to [location]. So I just dealt with the last several months, you know. So that was kind of an issue was an issue. But but now they gotta be dangerous again. That's fine.

161
00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.620
> P11: See what else they got here. Healthcare

162
00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:04.600
> P11: circle back to that.

163
00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.230
Thomas: Okay.

164
00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:12.420
Thomas: And even if you didn't see a topic that may not fit specifically.

165
00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:18.570
Thomas: you can let me know why, you know you choose it, and it's it's perfectly fine on the topic. So.

166
00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.210
> P11: Okay.

167
00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.880
> P11: looking up, health care benefits for myself and family.

168
00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:31.892
> P11: Of course I am my family.

169
00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:39.550
> P11: And yeah, [location], v, 8, West Clinic. Yeah, that's the one that used to be.

170
00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:40.490
Thomas: Okay.

171
00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:43.709
> P11: This is the one it is now. So there we go.

172
00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:54.170
> P11: So we just got a brand new clinic. It just opened July 26, th this last month.

173
00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:54.710
Thomas: Okay.

174
00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:55.950
> P11: That's it.

175
00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:58.639
> P11: This is all dummy information.

176
00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:00.320
Thomas: Exactly. Yep.

177
00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:05.369
> P11: That's fine.

178
00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.070
> P11: Okay? Blah, blah, blah.

179
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:08.290
> P11: Anywhere.

180
00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:10.000
> P11: Okay

181
00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:12.700
> P11: for name whatever.

182
00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.580
> P11: This is not a live website. Right? It's just.

183
00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:18.210
Thomas: Correct.

184
00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:18.780
> P11: So the

185
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:21.319
> P11: so I can type in whatever

186
00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:25.890
> P11: pronouns, what a politically

187
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:28.109
> P11: correct world we live in. Oh, my lord.

188
00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:30.769
> P11: I don't know what.

189
00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:34.920
> P11: Oh, okay, incorrect phone number, okay, check out the one.

190
00:16:36.846 --> 00:16:42.480
> P11: But yeah, I I could see me using this website for for things like this to get additional information.

191
00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.050
Thomas: Okay.

192
00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:47.560
> P11: The better mail outside. No, I do not, because it's okay. Need help

193
00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.170
> P11: required.

Thomas: Shane, one of the questions that we kind of have with this. So we can kind of get a better understanding of how, how zoomed in do you have like a setting like a percentage setting at all.

195
00:17:07.124 --> 00:17:14.509
> P11: I just go up to. Was it 20% or whatever? Actually, I'm not on that right now. I'm just using my one good eye, that

196
00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:15.939
> P11: server thing. Now.

197
00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:17.020
Thomas: Oh, really.

198
00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:25.210
> P11: I look at forms like, you know, Microsoft word and stuff like that. Then I hit the zoom for the most part. You know. Yeah.

199
00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.520
> P11: I probably should do it right now. But

200
00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:40.929
> P11: I'm doing going with them one good eye and Michael glasses. And so I'm still having a little stare screen like this, too, so probably would be to enact that right now. But I haven't done that yet.

201
00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:48.300
> P11: But definitely for word documents. Things like that. Yeah, I need it to zoom most of the time.

202
00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:49.660
Thomas: Okay.

203
00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:55.149
> P11: Got a screen for extended period of time like typing a letter, or, you know, anything like, you know.

204
00:17:55.460 --> 00:18:00.300
> P11: a word document or long email or something like that. I'll sometimes hit the zoom.

205
00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:01.400
> P11: Yeah.

206
00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.070
> P11: like I said, I, I

207
00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:10.719
> P11: I try not to use a laptop very often. I don't use it. I only pay one or 2 bills on it, and for the most part you can do the whole world on your phone and

208
00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:12.610
> P11: for good.

209
00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:18.630
> P11: My phone, I can actually see very well on my phone. For whatever reason, my phone, just smaller print and.

210
00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:25.609
> P11: With my eyeglasses, I do, and so I avoid my laptop as much as possible.

211
00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:26.000
Thomas: Okay.

212
00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:35.320
> P11: Yeah. So luckily, the V is a very good app and the health net app, that's also I can use on the

213
00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:38.370
> P11: yeah. I guess the only thing that they don't have on the

214
00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:40.569
> P11: is you can't check your labs.

215
00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:44.781
> P11: your Va labs on the on the Va.

216
00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:54.880
> P11: on your phone. That's where I have to go online. Go on the laptop computer to look at our lab results and things like that. So.

217
00:18:56.020 --> 00:19:04.620
Thomas: So right now, just kind of doing a quick summary of not using the zoom, because right now, the website

218
00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:09.370
Thomas: kind of is readable enough that. You don't have to.

219
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:13.678
> P11: Right right right between my my glasses, and

220
00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:20.269
> P11: I said, my one good eye, I can easily make ship make care of most of it, for the most part.

221
00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:21.270
Thomas: Gotcha.

222
00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:24.460
Thomas: so.

223
00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:25.660
> P11: Okay.

224
00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:30.610
> P11: what is

225
00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:35.070
> P11: Well.

226
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:36.600
> P11: okay.

227
00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:39.480
> P11: or

228
00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:42.309
> P11: hip surgery, just whatever.

229
00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:46.470
> P11: There you go. Something like that, you know.

230
00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.010
> P11: before I tell you, you know.

231
00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:54.979
> P11: it's a question about

232
00:19:56.020 --> 00:20:02.379
> P11: okay. And I guess the you fill this out. And they respond to you in the form of an email which would be great. You know.

233
00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:03.010
Thomas: Okay?

234
00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:11.110
Thomas: So as you're looking through this does that? Did that review and submit help you at all? Do you normally look at those types of pages.

235
00:20:12.165 --> 00:20:26.330
> P11: I I constantly look at at the said, the Va. Health site, the Va. Benefit healthcare and the Va. Healthnet, and this is good to have this. I've never. I've heard this, Sba, but I've never used it, but I can see it's a very good tool.

236
00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:28.939
> P11: and I could see me using it in the future.

237
00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:29.759
Thomas: When you.

238
00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:30.790
> P11: Last weekend.

239
00:20:31.187 --> 00:20:33.970
Thomas: When you click out through forms.

240
00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:34.970
> P11: Hello! Oh.

241
00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:35.770
Thomas: Oh! Can you hear me?

242
00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:36.549
> P11: Hold on!

243
00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:37.140
Thomas: Okay.

244
00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:44.929
> P11: I could, you know. Okay, is the Verizon's commercial use.

245
00:20:45.563 --> 00:21:02.033
Thomas: Just as a you went through all that super quick so one of the things that I just wanted to kind of go back in and and talk about for a moment on that where it kind of gave you a summary of everything, of all the information that you supplied.

246
00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:10.660
Thomas: Do you like go through those review and submits like, do you check your stuff, or do you just kind of like, read it through real quick.

247
00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:27.019
> P11: I I kind of with it a little quicker than I should. I apologize for that. But yeah, I would actually, if it was. Of course, if it's a live website and I'm looking, I want to make sure that everything is correct before I hit submit, because I definitely want a good answer. You know what the hell's going on. Basically.

248
00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:38.289
Thomas: Okay, has there ever been a time where you've gone back to? Maybe like edit like it could have been your question or personal information or anything. Have you ever edited anything?

249
00:21:39.275 --> 00:21:41.098
> P11: I don't believe so.

250
00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:46.320
> P11: not on the Va. Website. Of course I've done that with, you know.

251
00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:51.829
> P11: civilian complaints about products I've ordered from Walmart or Amazon, or something like that. But.

252
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:52.520
Thomas: Okay.

253
00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:55.746
> P11: As far as the Va. Website. No, I don't believe so.

254
00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:57.170
> P11: so.

255
00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:58.909
Thomas: Okay,

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:08.359
Thomas: and Shane, I'm not sure if you click on the back button in the browser, if we'll be able to go back to that Confirmation page.

257
00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:11.500
> P11: I could try that. Oh, there we go!

258
00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:18.749
Thomas: Yeah, so on this page. Is it giving you the information that you're expecting after you submit your question.

259
00:22:19.369 --> 00:22:22.330
> P11: I would lease that we got a confirmation number.

260
00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:25.800
> P11: probably print that off for saving it, or whatever.

261
00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:28.720
> P11: And then, if I had any questions I could.

262
00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:33.440
> P11: Course, I can call the Va. I got a confirmation number, and hopefully, I get an answer from somebody.

> P11: You know, they're in Washington, or wherever the Va. Is at that, give me an answer. What's going on with my with my question, or my claim, or

264
00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:48.820
> P11: whatever's going on? So I have that confirmation over, say, okay. So that would be that would thinking, Yeah.

265
00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:52.630
Thomas: When it says in in terms of

266
00:22:52.650 --> 00:23:03.929
Thomas: you should recite, receive a reply by email within 7 business days. What kind of what kind of feedback are you expecting from the Va. In that email?

267
00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:16.799
> P11: course, it's a government operation. So hopefully, it's within 7 days. So, but I would expect something back an email with a confirmation number listed, saying.

> P11: Dear, you know, chief bishop or Saint Bishop blah blah blah that in response to your question about hip surgery, or whatever.

> P11: we have the following options for you contact your local Va or your local Va health center. We've got scheduled appointment to do such and such and such. Yeah, I expect something like that from the Va. I would anticipate something.

> P11: semi friendly, so to speak. You know what I'm saying an answer for from the Va. About how to proceed with to get the

271
00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:58.200
> P11: the question that I had asked, you know.

272
00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:02.589
> P11: and get the care that I needed for whatever question I submitted.

273
00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:03.600
> P11: So.

274
00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:09.609
Thomas: Besides the email, is there any other place that you might expect that response

275
00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:11.990
Thomas: in using this form.

276
00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.239
> P11: hopefully, I'd get

277
00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:22.620
> P11: well. Here's something the Va. I say this about the Va. Health care system.

278
00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:31.320
> P11: They are very, very good about sending reminders about your appointments coming up, you get an email.

279
00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:33.449
> P11: You'll get one to 2

280
00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:38.160
> P11: text messages and you get a text message like an hour before your appointment.

281
00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:47.359
> P11: saying, Have you signed in yet as Ea for your appointment? So as far as that goes, that's fantastic. So I would expect something like that as well, maybe.

282
00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:49.569
> P11: especially if it's health related

283
00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:52.440
> P11: in the form of a text message. Possibly.

284
00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:53.260
Thomas: Oh, text, message.

285
00:24:53.260 --> 00:25:03.429
> P11: A reminder or something like that. Yeah, okay, really good. You. You missed your appointment with the Va. It's your own fault, because about a dozen times of your appointments coming up.

286
00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:04.180
Thomas: Okay.

287
00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:11.449
> P11: They ask you confirm your appointment constantly. I confirm on the line and confirm it over the phone because they call you. They actually call you.

288
00:25:12.156 --> 00:25:17.593
> P11: Remind you of your appointment with the Va. Health clinic in [location]. And so, like, okay, I'll be there.

289
00:25:20.066 --> 00:25:21.239
Thomas: Oh, good!

290
00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:24.440
> P11: Lawyer at the Va. Health Center as well, too. So.

291
00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:29.690
> P11: but that's part of the protocol. They want to give wrong systems the wrong vet, so.

292
00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:49.540
Thomas: Yeah. One of the things that I noticed when you got to this Confirmation page that you some people they might just like close the browser window you clicked on return to ask Va. When you clicked on that link. Was there anything that you expected? When you returned to the homepage on. Ask Va.

293
00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:53.799
> P11: Oh, not particularly. Just go back to what we began, and

294
00:25:53.930 --> 00:26:03.609
> P11: you know I might. I might want to go ask another question. That's why hit that as well, maybe look at the website again. So okay, maybe there's some forgot to ask. And

295
00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:06.740
> P11: yeah, go back to that. So yeah.

### Cool down

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:22.010
Thomas: Okay, that makes sense. The other things I just kinda wanna hear from you overall like from beginning to end, like I said, you went through this pretty quickly. How was, you know, like going through this form for you? Was there anything particularly challenging.

297
00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:30.862
> P11: Not at all. Actually, I think it was very well laid out user. Friendly, I guess, is the computer word for it.

298
00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:36.119
> P11: and it's error proof. That means if you didn't fill something out you couldn't go forward. I don't think

299
00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:39.390
> P11: you had to make sure you fill out your Zip code, your post.

300
00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:53.799
> P11: You're correct matter of fact, I didn't put the correct phone number in there. So it corrected me, says, with the correct phone number in there. So that, that's good. That's good. So you don't submit false information or incorrect information or incomplete information.

301
00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:54.130
Thomas: Okay.

302
00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:56.009
> P11: And that's good.

303
00:26:56.460 --> 00:27:03.640
Thomas: So. The in terms of unexpected behavior from the form. Did you encounter that at any time.

304
00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:05.500
> P11: Not at all.

305
00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:09.659
Thomas: Okay. Alright. As you were going through the form.

306
00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:11.689
Thomas: did you kind of know

307
00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:22.389
Thomas: how long the form, or like, maybe even at the beginning or or throughout the form. Did you know how long the form might take to fill out, or how far along you were within the form.

308
00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:27.880
> P11: yeah, I felt like I knew, and that we're coming along pretty good with it.

309
00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:29.849
> P11: I think they ask you just

310
00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:39.279
> P11: basic information that you. They need to have to process your question or your claim, or whatever's going on. They got to know what's going on with a veteran. And what is your exact question?

311
00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:58.780
> P11: I don't think that was too much to ask. So normally, I wouldn't give up my social security number. This is a Va website. So I'd have no problem with that. I don't think that, anyway. But you know that type of stuff, you know. You gotta make sure it's correct. I think they're asking straight for questions, and it's stuff that they needed to

312
00:27:59.336 --> 00:28:02.899
> P11: process your question and give you an answer. So.

313
00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:26.020
Thomas: So on onto the subject of like knowing how far along you were. One of the specific questions that I that I have is that there was a time, as you were going through the form, and I'm not sure, if you noticed it or not, that on each page that there was something that said that you might be like 20% complete with the form, or 42% complete. Did you notice that at all.

314
00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:29.999
> P11: I did see that 5%, 10%, 30% correct.

315
00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:33.239
Thomas: Does that? Do you find that helpful at all?

316
00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:37.860
> P11: I? Yeah, sure. Sure. Let me. I've got a couple more questions to ask.

317
00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:38.710
> P11: Okay,

318
00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:40.880
> P11: it, this

319
00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:49.120
> P11: you you got a complicated question, something that you. They need a good answer for you. You're not going to fill it out in one page, and so I understand the need to

320
00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:52.990
> P11: answer all the questions correctly, you know. That's you know

321
00:28:53.400 --> 00:29:01.150
> P11: I'm a little impatient sometimes, but that that's necessary information. They that the V is going to need. And so I find that helpful.

322
00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:01.955
Thomas: Okay.

323
00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:05.850
Thomas: and

324
00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:08.429
Thomas: is there anything?

325
00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:10.690
Thomas: Yeah, throughout the form that you would

326
00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:14.579
Thomas: change or expect, or or do differently?

327
00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:17.680
> P11: I not that I come aware of.

328
00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:18.060
Thomas: Okay.

329
00:29:18.317 --> 00:29:25.020
> P11: I'm sure I I'm sure I went through that too quick. I wish I could go back. I did kind of zip through. I apologize.

330
00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:31.099
Thomas: That's okay. You can always hit the back button if you want to see any pages in particular. If you have any questions about a page.

331
00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:36.010
> P11: Okay, okay, yeah. We're still here. There we go. There. We go.

332
00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:40.170
Thomas: The nice thing. It's a prototype, and we're not actually like sending anything off.

333
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:41.120
> P11: That's right.

334
00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:45.299
Thomas: Joe's, probably about the only person that would would read through any of it.

335
00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:47.260
> P11: 98, 4. But

336
00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:48.599
> P11: I see that

337
00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:51.090
> P11: 90% of the form. What's your question?

338
00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:55.399
> P11: Okay? Very good. 93%.

339
00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:58.949
> P11: These are straightforward, simple questions. You know.

340
00:29:58.950 --> 00:29:59.700
Thomas: On this.

341
00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:00.709
> P11: They need to.

342
00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:01.490
Thomas: Okay.

343
00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:07.339
> P11: That's fine!

344
00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:07.900
Thomas: Okay?

345
00:30:11.301 --> 00:30:18.300
Thomas: When it asks you for your postal code? And the information that was on that page, did you find that confusing at all?

346
00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:28.209
> P11: not the 1st time, but it seemed like it was redundant, because they asked for it more than once.

347
00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:28.710
Thomas: Okay.

348
00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:30.750
> P11: I think again, my postal cord, like

349
00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:33.989
> P11: 2 or 3 times like, here's 1 yeah.

350
00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:36.239
> P11: hit search and then

351
00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:39.630
> P11: and say, Here, get the clinic, or whatever it was.

352
00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:41.050
> P11: And I think

353
00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:42.959
> P11: and here let me see here.

354
00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:44.739
> P11: Zip code.

355
00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:50.149
> P11: can you? There it is again. Say, you put your poster code in

356
00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:53.689
> P11: so. But that's fine. It's just. It's not a big deal. It's just

357
00:30:54.050 --> 00:30:56.620
> P11: maybe a little redundant. But that's not a big deal.

358
00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:57.240
Thomas: Yeah.

359
00:30:57.920 --> 00:30:58.680
Thomas: alright.

360
00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:03.835
Thomas: Well, I like I said, Shane. You

361
00:31:05.493 --> 00:31:11.513
Thomas: do let me ask you this. Do you have any additional questions for us. We don't have any other questions.

362
00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:16.130
> P11: Okay, no, I I don't. I think this is a great tool that the vas put out

363
00:31:16.553 --> 00:31:24.460
> P11: I see myself, maybe using this in the future. I've got like I said, several crimes. I got a lot of medical problems.

364
00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:28.429
> P11: I'm recently diagnosed with chronic kidney disease. So that's not good

365
00:31:28.994 --> 00:31:37.669
> P11: from my civilian doctor. So I'm on the website every day the website. And of course, my civilian website as well.

366
00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:50.200
> P11: My doctors, I have got 2, 3 dots points every single week. So I got a lot of medical issues right now, including these and everything else. And so. But I can see myself using this in the future to ask a simple question like we did today.

367
00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:50.930
Thomas: Okay.

368
00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:53.399
> P11: For you know, maybe something that the

369
00:31:55.120 --> 00:32:01.920
> P11: I wish there was a way they could pro. I don't think they have this information. Sba on on the phone or on the app. I don't believe it.

370
00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:09.869
> P11: and I can see why, cause it's it's, you know, it's a lot of questions to fill out on on your, on your cell phone, right? So.

371
00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:10.460
Thomas: Yeah.

372
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:23.570
> P11: But but I'm a phone person on my cell phone. And that's pretty much by my side. 24, 7. Okay, like, I said, what? Once or twice a week I'll do. Get up. I come in my office here and

373
00:32:23.850 --> 00:32:35.740
> P11: and get him a laptop to to go to the Va website, because I can get a little more full complete information about my claim status and what's going on with certain things like that with Va, I can't see all that information

374
00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:39.069
> P11: on my cell phone, you understand? So, okay.

375
00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:40.290
> P11: yeah.

376
00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:44.020
Thomas: But overall. Do you think

377
00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:47.479
Thomas: this form would be usable on a on on your phone?

378
00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:48.860
> P11: I don't think so.

379
00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:49.470
Thomas: Okay.

380
00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:51.771
> P11: There's too many questions to ask, and

381
00:32:52.531 --> 00:33:00.940
> P11: it, it'd be be hard to answer all these, but it wouldn't be hard to answer at all. But it's more practical, I think, for desktop application.

382
00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:01.480
Thomas: Okay.

383
00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:02.420
Thomas: yeah.

384
00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:27.679
Thomas: Well, Shane, thank you so much for all your feedback. You can stop sharing your your screen now, if you'd like and I just wanted to say, you know, we we thank you so much for your time today. Para, Jean is gonna send you a thank you note with some information that you can pass along to other veterans? If they'd like to participate in the future for future research sessions.

385
00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:29.120
> P11: Fantastic, fantastic.

386
00:33:29.938 --> 00:33:38.900
Thomas: Shane, thank you so much, and I hope you have a great rest of the day, and sounds hopefully, everything is, is

387
00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:41.459
Thomas: nice and and beautiful down there in [location] today.

388
00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:43.219
> P11: Well hot, but other than that.

389
00:33:45.045 --> 00:33:49.779
Thomas: I hear that I'm in Tennessee, so it's the same thing with the humidity here. So.

390
00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:50.970
> P11: You vols. Fan.

391
00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:55.079
Thomas: I? Well, I went to the University of Kansas.

392
00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:55.900
> P11: Oh, okay.

393
00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:57.000
Thomas: So I'm a Jayhawk.

394
00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.229
> P11: Yeah, they're my game.

395
00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:11.531
Thomas: Absolutely so. [location] gators have always been one of my favorites of the of the of the South. So yeah. But I I definitely know a lot of Vols fans around here, that's for sure, and especially Alabama fans.

396
00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:13.560
> P11: Football season starts next week. So.

397
00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:22.149
Thomas: Oh, right? Yeah. Looking forward to it. Well, well, good luck with the season, and have a have a wonderful rest of the day.

398
00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:25.719
> P11: I sure appreciate it. Thanks so much. Guys.
