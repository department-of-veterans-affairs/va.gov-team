### Warm up

> P4: Hi, Thomas, computer, audio.

Thomas: Okay. So I've started the recording. And I'd like to confirm again, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

> P4: Yes, you can record to make recordings.

Thomas: Okay. Thanks. [P4].

> P4: You're welcome. Alright.

Thomas: So again, if we happen to share this, names will be scrubbed, and there there won't be anything that would be specifically identifying you.

Thomas: Alright. So as we begin here, I'd like to just warm up a little bit, asking a few questions.

Thomas: 1st thing is, I'm curious. How long have you been a veteran.

> P4: 24 years.

Thomas: Wow. Okay.

> P4: I'm retired. Air Force.

Thomas: And have you ever contacted the Va online or over the phone.

> P4: Yes.

Thomas: And can you tell me about a time when you contacted them, and how you know that that contact went.

> P4: Well, I'm also a veteran service officer with the Blinded Veterans Association.

> P4: So depending on

> P4: what is going on, typically the most contact I've had on the phone

> P4: is with veterans in my office that need to. We need to get information

> P4: about their particular claims, issues, concerns

> P4: from the Va. And in most instances that's the quickest, easiest way to get there

> P4: is to call the 800 number go through the process

> P4: they authorize to have a 3rd party, and then we can speak and discuss it that way. Typically, it's been

> P4: quite productive. And we've gotten everything we've needed.

> P4: I have on my own

> P4: had to contact. Va.

> P4: now, this is going back a while now a couple of years.

> P4: and it was to update my marriage

> P4: status because it had been wrong, and I didn't realize it until one day. So I called them up. I said, Okay, can I do this? And that one wasn't as efficient as it could have been, simply because they said, You just need to go to va.gov and update it. Which

> P4: which was in fact. True.

> P4: Ish.

> P4: okay? What what would have helped was, you know, you have to have

> P4: any marriage divorces, dates, times, all that stuff.

> P4: and I did not know that. So that that level of frustration was kinda

> P4: very, very high up there, because, you know, you're trying to get into it. You're trying to do it, and you couldn't get there. So sometimes, when there's things like that, it needs to get a little better clarification. But other than that, the only other issue with the phone in

> P4: that I've had is consistently every time I've ever called it says that there are extremely long waiting times. And you you're

> P4: can be expected to wait 20 min, and that 20 min may be either 20 seconds or 20 h.

Thomas: Wow!

> P4: Okay cause. I've been literally on hold for hours on end at some point

> P4: and like, say, all times, it's literally 20 seconds and they answer the phone. So

> P4: I, you know the if you have any input at all into the management of that system can can get them to fully understand, because I know commercially there's organizations out there, companies, etc, that will give you your next in line, or give the callback option. That's always another great option. If they could do that callback option where you know.

> P4: leave your number, and they'll call you when they when they get done. That would be a great benefit, I think.

Thomas: Okay. Now, that makes that makes total sense. Yeah. Well, thank you for sharing that with me. And it's very helpful for us to know and to document these things, of how your experiences with contacting the Va in the past. So in this assistive tool that you're using voice over for the Mac. How long have you been using voice over.

> P4: Since 16, I think it was.

Thomas: Okay.

> P4: But I got it initially. I had windows, and then I lost my ability to use the zoom.

> P4: and

> P4: that's when I

> P4: converted over to the Mac and started using Voiceover.

Thomas: Okay. Alright.

Thomas: alright. So in just for our transcript, I was just gonna mention that you're gonna be on the desktop today. But you also have the tablet and the phone.

> P4: Yes, and a Macbook so.

Thomas: Okay.

> P4: I've got the full spectrum there.

Thomas: Okay, fantastic.

Thomas: So you're gonna be on a like a desktop rather than like a.

> P4: 7 inch 27 inch desktop.

> P4: It's a 4 year old model. I'm on the latest version of Mac. I forget what it is Ventura.

> P4: Think is what it is. So

> P4: we're already up there. And it was

> P4: I did the update. Most recent update was a couple of weeks ago. I do have

> P4: Microsoft office suite on here, Microsoft. 3, 65,

> P4: and teams. So because I'm with the VBA. I'm [role] with Blind Veterans Association. So therefore, those have to work there with it.

> P4: so yeah.

Thomas: So some additional questions that I have number one, have you you? What have you gone on to? va.gov, and and used assistive technology.

> P4: It's been a while.

Thomas: Okay. Alright. And have you ever heard of? Ask Va before?

> P4: Yes.

Thomas: You have. Okay? Have you used it online?

> P4: I truly couldn't answer that, because I don't know. I know I typically will do a search which

> P4: you know, for example,

> P4: presumptives of agent orange, you know. Go in there, and because it's a continually changing product

> P4: and different presumptives.

> P4: I don't even try to. I don't even try to store that information anymore, because it changes too often.

> P4: So I'll do a new search which

> P4: can be a bit cumbersome sometimes. Sometimes you gotta really get that

> P4: to the granular level of exactly what you want. So you get the Va site and not some other site. And all this other stuff.

> P4: and that's 1 of the issues is

> P4: the granular. Specificity is sometimes veterans will come in. So I found this on the web. Well, yes, you did, and Jim bob@lunacy.com.

> P4: you know. He created this, and if it was correct, that'd be awesome. But it's you know it's not correct. So getting people to understand that there's a difference between va.gov versus va.com. If there is a va.com. I don't know but they're saying, you know, a lot of times they'll they'll get into that

> P4: into those rabbit holes which will give them what they want to hear, which is not what they need to hear. Yeah, so.

Thomas: Okay.

Thomas: and you know it. It, you know, thinking back. And and maybe this is something that might have been a little bit too long to to recall. Have.

Thomas: Could you rate your experience with assistive technology with va.gov or any of the associated websites with va.gov.

> P4: About 8 trillion times better than what it was.

Thomas: Okay.

> P4: Okay, yeah.

> P4: Martha Wilkes. dan diddle oh, I forget his name now. He just retired with the 508 folks.

Thomas: Okay.

> P4: Those folks have just been, and y'all, too, have been working just so hard to make it work so much better.

> P4: One of my biggest

> P4: issues

> P4: with longer term veterans

> P4: is the

> P4: my healthy vet. When that 1st launched

> P4: back 10 years ago, it was a disaster. Okay, it was actually impossible to use now it's actually usable.

> P4: but it left such a sour taste in so many mouths that they don't want to go back to that Martha and Team have come up with the

> P4: health and benefits app on the phone, which I am a major proponent of that I'm always going into that

> P4: I gotta get with Brie, actually, because they got the

> P4: the

> P4: test site. You can actually do that for teaching and everything. And I've been having issues getting that working. But that's something I can work with. Bree. But the health and benefits app is a major major boom

> P4: to the Va. And to the veterans and getting them the information they need

> P4: that fast.

> P4: The problem. And Martha, I know, is working on this, and Dan is working on. This is the whole creating the account

> P4: and the credentialing

> P4: credentialing to login.gov is not bad

> P4: doing the credentialing process to get the app up and running

> P4: is absolute lunacy.

> P4: Okay?

Thomas: Okay.

> P4: Because it requires either a state issued driver's license or state, issued Id. Card.

> P4: and it's been causing a lot of problems where it's not accepting the scanned images. It's just not grabbing it, not using it. And their answer is to talk to the mailman.

> P4: you know, and that's just not good, and I, I

> P4: and I know Martha and Team have been working on trying to clear that up

> P4: again. I go into the same thing

> P4: with my health event with the Va. If we're in the Va. We're trying to get a Va app, we should be able to have the Va. Id card either work or just

> P4: lock into those specific records. A way to do that. And that's that's 1 of the

> P4: issues that we're having the Va security

> P4: and everything getting that sorted out

> P4: hopefully, they'll get that sort out. But other than that, once that's done, the health and benefits app is an absolute game changer. When it comes to stuff.

> P4: va.gov, where they're going on. va.gov, with the

> P4: updating and changing things and and

> P4: making that app more accessible and easier to use. Instead of having to fill out all these crazy forms. And in crazy ways.

> P4: they're making a real game changer there, too. It's really working very good. So.

Thomas: Well, hopefully, with what we're doing today will help us improve. Ask Vagov online. And so have you shared your screen on Zoom, okay.

> P4: Start doing it now.

Thomas: Yeah, that'd be great.

> P4: Okay, give me one second. I gotta zoom in really big to get those little buttons. Okay.

> P4: Zoom Meeting open chat panel, summary share screen, share, screen, share, screen, window. Oh, crap! Don't tell me this is gonna bust me, I think.

> P4: Hang on. We may have to reconnect here. Okay, pause. I just thought about this

> P4: share. Desktop, one application zoom, share, toolbar, window mute, you are screen share. You have started screen share. Oh, is it taking? It? Has new window.

Thomas: Looks like.

> P4: Oh, you know what it was yesterday at the office that it wouldn't allow me to share. I gotta. I gotta do the settings in in the one in

> P4: at the office, on my other. Mac.

> P4: I couldn't remember where it was at. Yeah, yesterday. It said, I gotta do that. I want screen share yesterday, and I couldn't get it done. So.

Thomas: Okay? Well, we've gotten to this point, which is fantastic. So the next thing is, we're gonna go to a a web, URL. And would you prefer that I dictate that to you, or share that within the chat in zoom.

> P4: Let's see if you shared in chat. I'll see if I can get to it.

Thomas: Okay, cause a a lot of times. It's a very short URL, yeah.

> P4: Let me just do this. Then, okay, go ahead.

Thomas: Okay, so it's BIT.

> P4: Oh, bid completion selected.

Thomas: Period.

Thomas: Yeah. Completion. LY.

> P4: You know, bigly completion select.

Thomas: Then forward, slash!

> P4: Forward! Slash!

Thomas: And then the word, ask

Thomas: a SK,

Thomas: yeah, and then dash.

> P4: Ivan.

Thomas: VA,

Thomas: that's it.

> P4: Why slash as far.

Thomas: See this one

Thomas: perfect. Wow! That was super simple to get there. So the next thing here is that

3## Form

Thomas: one of the things I'd like for you to do is as we're kind of going through this website a lot of times each page. I'm going to just kind of let you get the information on the page, and then, once you're ready, you let me know, kind of, you know. Explain to me what it is that we're kind of experiencing on this page for me.

> P4: Okay, you just brought up a very good point.

> P4: Do you know what quick nav is on a Mac?

Thomas: Quick! Nav!

> P4: Choosing the arrow keys.

Thomas: Yes, yes.

> P4: Okay, so quick. Nav

> P4: will not always work now because they didn't update with Mac, which will cause issues. So I may be bouncing between quick nav.

> P4: Tabbing!

> P4: Oh, I I may do all sorts of weird things to get there, because quick nav is not allowing necessarily the navigation function to continue on, so I'll try to let you know what I'm doing as far as keystrokes again. A lot of this won't be the Va. Side of the house. It's going to be the apple side of the house, and I spent

172
00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:09.049
> P4: honestly about 8 h one day making recordings with with Apple, trying to get them to figure out what's going on, and that's it's been a while, but there's been no update to that that I know of. So.

173
00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:09.860
Thomas: Okay.

174
00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:11.270
Thomas: So

175
00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:16.099
Thomas: so I'm just gonna give you a little context of what we're going to be looking at today. Okay.

176
00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:16.820
> P4: Okay.

177
00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:20.609
Thomas: So this, what we're going to be looking at is a tool called ask Va.

178
00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:27.851
Thomas: and so right now it it's there. It's like, ask Va dot go ask va

179
00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:41.890
Thomas: All of a sudden I've forgotten the URL that it's a sub domain of the Va. Yeah. And so what it is is that it's a way for veterans to contact the Va. To ask questions online.

180
00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:42.950
> P4: Okay.

181
00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:44.970
Thomas: So for today's session

182
00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:55.910
Thomas: is that this is the scenario that I'm going to pretend is like you're asking the Va. A question about a recent experience that you had at a Va medical center.

183
00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:57.440
Thomas: Okay.

184
00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:58.370
> P4: Okay.

185
00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:07.640
Thomas: So I can remind you about this scenario whenever you need me to. But again, it's about you're gonna be asking a question about a recent experience that you had at a Va. Medical Center.

186
00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:08.365
> P4: Okay.

187
00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:24.889
Thomas: So now, as you navigate, we just want to kind of understand what you're going through. You know, at you know what you're thinking about as you kind of experience each page and how you're using your assistive technology to support you in gathering the information.

188
00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:44.580
Thomas: So when you start the form. I'm gonna pretty much stay quiet. So you can focus on the task what your screen reader is announcing. And quite often, right now I can hear what your screen reader is saying. So I'm gonna really try to be quiet, as you know, all that's being read to you. Okay.

189
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:45.510
> P4: Sure.

190
00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:45.915
Thomas: Alright.

191
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:47.255
Thomas: So

192
00:15:48.230 --> 00:16:02.150
Thomas: as we get started here in in. So like, I said, instead of making you sign in, we have just landed on the basically the the homepage for ask Va, that if you've signed in, okay, so we're gonna pretend like, this is your account.

193
00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:08.848
Thomas: So when you're ready, go ahead and what? What I'm gonna have you do is

322

> P4: Center for Women Veterans Center for Women's Veterans.

324

326
00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:15.449

327
00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:17.080
> P4: There. But again, that's

328
00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:21.280
> P4: that's from my perspective as a Vso. Looking at it that way.

329
00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:21.820
Thomas: Okay.

330
00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:26.580

331
00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:27.370
Thomas: Gotcha.

332
00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:35.399
Thomas: So and you're talking in regards to. If you were going to ask a question about a recent experience that you had at a Va medical center, right.

333
00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:36.200
> P4: Yeah.

334
00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.400
Thomas: Yeah, okay.

335
00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:39.992
Thomas: no, that makes that makes sense.

336
00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:47.160
Thomas: So if you kind of narrowed some of this down out of maybe one or 2 choices.

337
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:53.550
Thomas: Do you feel like that? There might be one or 2 that would kind of stand out as a potential category.

338
00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:58.370
> P4: I don't understand your question on.

339
00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:15.450
Thomas: Oh, sorry. Yeah. So if you're going to proceed on from here, if they're asking you, you know, choose a category. That's gonna best describe your question as you start out, what category would you potentially select to to asking a question about a recent experience? You had a V at a Va medical center.

340
00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:27.170
> P4: Alright. Let me do this. Let me go. I'll give you a real world here. Okay. Veteran affairs. Death. Okay.

341
00:27:27.976 --> 00:27:29.310
> P4: Just yesterday

342
00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:34.050

344

345
00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:45.539
> P4: which I actually got to research and find that pamphlet.

346
00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:46.790
> P4: So

347
00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:49.960
> P4: let me select this. Okay.

348
00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:56.559
> P4: and let's see if this is going to bring, because theoret, and I haven't seen this pamphlet, but I was told this pamphlet will contain

349
00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:58.945
> P4: all the things to set up.

350
00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:09.749
> P4: you know, pre death settings and and all that stuff, all the all the information forms that you could possibly need, and all the questions. So it sounds like a very good pamphlet.

351
00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:11.200
> P4: So

352
00:28:12.395 --> 00:28:18.460
> P4: that's that's why I I this is actually a good thing here. Hopefully, this will shoot me and get me there. Okay.

355
00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:29.789
Thomas: So real, quick. [P4].

356
00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:30.380
> P4: Yeah.

357
00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:37.909
Thomas: On this one. Did you hear veterans affairs, DEBT, or DEAT h.

358
00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.789
> P4: DEAT h.

359
00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:42.339
Thomas: Okay, this one actually says, debt, DE.

360
00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:44.110
> P4: Oh, okay.

361
00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:44.720
Thomas: Yeah.

362
00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:47.492
> P4: Okay. Alright!

363
00:28:48.360 --> 00:29:00.679
Thomas: So. No. So that that's really interesting, because because they're so similar in sounding when it says it that fast, I can see why that that would be a a challenge to to hear the difference between the 2.

364
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:10.420
Thomas: So before you hit, continue for this particular scenario, what we're just going to go ahead and do is select healthcare on this one for the category.

365
00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:11.230
> P4: Okay.

366
00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:12.520

370
00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:23.990

371
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.360
Thomas: Okay.

372
00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:27.699
> P4: Yeah, if if you could say indebtedness or something like that.

373
00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:28.840
Thomas: Okay.

374
00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:32.599
> P4: Cause I did. I heard death, and I thought we were talking about death all the way through. There.

375
00:29:33.053 --> 00:29:34.869
Thomas: You know, that's yeah.

376
00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:35.849

377
00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:38.119

378
00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:45.689
> P4: a lot of veterans, you know, and spouses and things like that. That's that's a lot of question I get asked is is death benefit.

379
00:29:45.690 --> 00:30:02.869
Thomas: Okay, if if that label was also changed so it it some of these labels we are going to be changing. And in that particular case where it says death or or vet death veterans, affairs, debt would end up actually saying

380
00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:07.239
Thomas: debt for benefit over payments and healthcare

381
00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:08.820
Thomas: copay bills.

382
00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:15.229
Thomas: not sure if that would help or not. But if that would still be a challenge to hear that word at the beginning.

383
00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:20.249
> P4: Say, if you did that just just overpayments debt, slash overpayments.

384
00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:21.310
Thomas: Gotcha. Okay.

385
00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:24.550
> P4: Cause. Then, you know, it's dealing with finances and overpayments.

386
00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:26.358

It's a question of not being able to dress yourself and make sure you've got a brown, 2 brown shoes instead of a brown shoe and a black shoe.

485
00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:43.580

> P4: I don't know the best answer for that.

583
00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:56.190
Thomas: Right? Okay? So your range would at least need to be within 50 miles or or more.

584
00:43:58.480 --> 00:43:59.580
> P4: I would say

585

590
00:44:48.590 --> 00:45:06.199

607
00:46:19.350 --> 00:46:22.739

609
00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:37.790

610
00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:41.890

937
01:09:05.089 --> 01:09:12.949

938
01:09:13.119 --> 01:09:15.919
> P4: And that's okay. Why it keeps repeating that I don't know.

939
01:09:16.370 --> 01:09:19.490
> P4: I would just have you know, the main

940
01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:28.169
> P4: the contact information and the question. Instead of having all those different variables in there.

941

Thomas: Okay.

942
01:09:29.450 --> 01:09:33.060

944

945

946
01:09:49.279 --> 01:09:49.849
Thomas: Okay.

947
01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:05.130
> P4: You know just I I guess it should just be a confirmation of the

948
01:10:05.390 --> 01:10:06.989
> P4: answers that you chose.

949
01:10:06.990 --> 01:10:08.840
Thomas: Right? Oh, that makes sense. Yeah.

950
01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:09.709
> P4: Yeah, so.

951
01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:11.140
> P4: Of the options.

952
01:10:11.896 --> 01:10:32.069
Thomas: Yeah, that that I can see how that gets so very repetitive. And this is probably one of the the things I know that we are still looking quite a bit at this page in terms of the design and your experience on this is super helpful on on this. And.

953
01:10:32.820 --> 01:10:54.340
Thomas: [P4], I think that we have about 10 min left, and one of the things here, let's just say just as a 1 last little test for you here on the test of this design and see if it makes sense. Let's say, if you needed to update your phone number your email address, for whatever reason

954
01:10:55.790 --> 01:11:06.800
Thomas: would would you do that here, or could you do that here, or would you just like, say, Oh, I'll just go back in the form, or or does it? Is it helpful that you could do this here.

955
01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:11.480
> P4: Well, you know. Okay, so edit your contact information.

956
01:11:11.610 --> 01:11:14.990
> P4: So there, you got edit. I guess if you put a list

957
01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:16.590
> P4: phone email address

958
01:11:16.710 --> 01:11:35.059
> P4: phone number, your contact. I mean, this works the edit button. But instead of having all these things there, okay, just if this was the one was chosen. Okay, I think I chose phone number just because if it just had the phone number and that and that edit button.

959
01:11:35.510 --> 01:11:38.730
> P4: You know, if I click that edit button right now.

960
01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:45.659
> P4: Okay. E. Slash, name slash his uncheck scroll down. Share this entire? Should we contact editing answer, E. Slash, name, slash his uncheck phone call.

961
01:11:45.690 --> 01:11:46.555
> P4: Okay,

962
01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:54.790
> P4: 44,445,551,200. So I can't tell. I don't think it put me automatically in that box.

963
01:11:55.490 --> 01:12:01.440
> P4: But if it went right to that box, yeah, okay, because these are these options here also

964
01:12:01.450 --> 01:12:02.920
> P4: would be, I mean.

965
01:12:05.330 --> 01:12:14.119
> P4: okay, I can't go forward there, editing answers. You are only able to edit some answers on this page. You may need to return to an earlier page. Move forward.

966
01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:16.300
> P4: I think, or did it? No.

967
01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:16.880
Thomas: Hmm.

968
01:12:17.450 --> 01:12:18.110
> P4: You know. Let me

969
01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:19.800
> P4: let me hit.

970
01:12:20.170 --> 01:12:21.100

975
01:12:37.250 --> 01:12:44.750
> P4: does this have everything on there from the other one, though? Yeah, there we go. Yeah, she would have did it kind of

976
01:12:45.450 --> 01:12:48.649
> P4: brought that page forward to this page. Here.

977
01:12:50.010 --> 01:12:52.770
> P4: Okay? So we would change that and then

978
01:12:53.490 --> 01:12:59.979
> P4: update your contact and cancel. If your pronoun, if your pronouns aren't listed editing and update your contact information. So

979
01:13:01.730 --> 01:13:08.819
> P4: yeah, to me, it's it's like, really repetitive at this point. I mean, it's just it's going to absolute redundancy of lunacy here.

980
01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:09.470
Thomas: Yeah.

981
01:13:09.470 --> 01:13:13.319
> P4: And that would be, you know. I'm cheating right now, using a mouse honestly.

982
01:13:14.056 --> 01:13:17.779
> P4: But if I was using the quick nav oh, I'd be frustrated to no end at this point.

983
01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:30.370
Thomas: Okay, that's really good to know. Let's go ahead, and we can either hit, save, or cancel out of this. And that's perfectly fine. And what we're just gonna do is just kind of like, have a a bit of reflection here to to wind down.

984
01:13:30.370 --> 01:13:32.970
> P4: Okay, where's save or cancel? Where do you see that.

985
01:13:32.970 --> 01:13:38.513
Thomas: Oh, sorry! You'd actually even moused over it just a little bit ago. It's

986
01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:39.570
> P4: This one.

987
01:13:40.090 --> 01:13:44.569
Thomas: No, it's up a little bit further. Just right about there. Yep.

988
01:13:44.570 --> 01:13:46.140
> P4: This one, yeah.

989
01:13:46.300 --> 01:13:47.100
> P4: okay.

990
01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:47.700
Thomas: Yeah.

991
01:13:47.970 --> 01:13:49.320
> P4: Okay. Alright!

### Cool down

01:13:49.670 --> 01:13:57.759
Thomas: So at at this moment, [P4], you can stop sharing and we'll just kind of do a a little bit of a reflection to kind of

993
01:13:58.210 --> 01:13:59.750
Thomas: end our session here today.

994
01:13:59.750 --> 01:14:01.729
> P4: Languages at the fligger link.

995
01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:10.159
> P4: Forget how to get out of damn thing when I'm here now. It don't matter to me, man. I don't want. I don't want to just hit quick on you. So.

996
01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:11.386
Thomas: Okay, so

997
01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:23.979
Thomas: I I'll tell you. This is probably one of the most informative sessions that we've had over the past day and a half. So what I'd like to hear from you is overall.

998
01:14:24.553 --> 01:14:25.520
Thomas: You know.

999
01:14:26.121 --> 01:14:29.489
Thomas: How has this experience overall been for you?

1000
01:14:30.950 --> 01:14:36.919
> P4: This has been good, if you know, this is this is really a long, long major leap.

1001
01:14:37.670 --> 01:14:40.390
> P4: Getting the information out in an easier way.

1002
01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:41.760
> P4: Oh.

1003
01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:44.540
> P4: I'm gonna be using it a hell of a lot more.

1004
01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:44.930
Thomas: Okay.

1005
01:14:44.930 --> 01:14:45.780
> P4: Honestly.

1006
01:14:46.050 --> 01:14:49.810
> P4: I'm gonna be pushing this one out there. My question is now.

1007
01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:55.610
> P4: the big thing is because we we didn't really get into this, and and from my own knowledge base.

1008
01:14:55.910 --> 01:15:03.499
> P4: If I have a veteran and we have this, what's the website we go to? Is it va.gov slash, ask, or is it ask Va or.

1009
01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:20.299
Thomas: So in something like this, I believe it would be something where, if you were going to use this, it'd be like va.gov, maybe going into? Ask? Va. I'm sorry, like contact contact us. And then there would be a link on that page for ask Va.

1010
01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:27.479
> P4: Okay. So my thing would be, make that easy to get va.gov, and and put a banner up there as v. 8 or something.

1011
01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:28.190
Thomas: Right.

1012
01:15:28.537 --> 01:15:32.359
> P4: Cause this is this can be a really really helpful tool.

1013
01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:32.700
Thomas: Okay.

1014
01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:36.320
> P4: To get through there, and quite honestly, you know.

1015
01:15:37.140 --> 01:15:45.640
> P4: my neighbor just passed away. He was a veteran, and a lot of the questions I was going to ask literally in this was based on that situation. There, that's good to know.

1016
01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:51.879
> P4: Death. Death benefits all these things because it that is.

1017
01:15:52.150 --> 01:15:59.780
> P4: pointing in the right directions for a lot of these questions. The only other thing I would add, and we didn't get into it there.

1018
01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:01.500
> P4: But on the phone number.

1019
01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:06.439
> P4: put a note or caveat, or something that

1020
01:16:07.085 --> 01:16:10.740
> P4: roughly, how long it would take to have the phone

1021
01:16:10.910 --> 01:16:12.450
> P4: call come in.

1022
01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:21.543
> P4: you know a day, 2 days within 3 days whatever, if you, if you can narrow that down to a rough timeframe. Yeah. And then

1023
01:16:21.980 --> 01:16:24.650
> P4: and I know this is going to be on your capability.

1024
01:16:24.790 --> 01:16:25.630
> P4: But

1025
01:16:27.456 --> 01:16:31.010
> P4: if it's coming from an 800 number or 2 0, 2, or

1026
01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:36.069
> P4: because people typically won't answer the phone, even though you've asked them to call.

1027
01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:36.680
Thomas: Right.

1028
01:16:36.970 --> 01:16:38.989
> P4: They won't answer the phone because of the.

1029
01:16:38.990 --> 01:16:40.440
Thomas: An unrecognized number.

1030
01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:51.699
> P4: Unrecognized number. Yeah, so. And and I know putting out the thing there is, you know, in mind, because I got to save my contacts. It comes up as Va. But if they could make it go out as a caller, id

1031
01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:56.620
> P4: va, ask Va. Or something like that, they would know. That's the phone call.

1032
01:16:56.620 --> 01:16:57.220
Thomas: Okay.

1033
01:16:57.670 --> 01:17:02.360
> P4: And and I don't know how to make that happen if it's in your purview or capabilities, or

1034
01:17:02.390 --> 01:17:05.260
> P4: you know where that lies. Yeah.

1035
01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:19.360
Thomas: We can definitely check on that. That's really great feedback cause we've heard that from other folks of like, if if I select a phone call. I may not know who it is that's calling and and ignore the call. And so.

1036
01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:22.129
> P4: And that's it.

1037
01:17:22.170 --> 01:17:25.060
> P4: And I can tell you from my experience as a Vso.

1038
01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:34.399
> P4: With the Blinded Veterans Association ours crossed, we're trying to figure out how to get that fixed for a while now crosses a 2 0 2 area code. So people call

1039
01:17:34.540 --> 01:17:38.159
> P4: they leave a message. We try calling back. They won't answer because they don't recognize it.

1040
01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:38.720
Thomas: Okay.

1041
01:17:40.390 --> 01:18:04.790
Thomas: you. You pointed out a a number of good unexpected behaviors. Sometimes it's it's because of what apple and the the quick nav does in in you also mentioned like, with regards to the the postal code and the order being flipped, is there anything else that you'd want to give us feedback on where you felt like, maybe unsure at any moment. What what to do next.

1042
01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:13.490
> P4: no, the only thing like I say, I I would just put at the honestly at the 1st page where it said, personal information. Yeah.

1043
01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:23.710
> P4: put put the phone number email and address in in there. Okay? And then, later on, you know, how do you want to be contacted? You know that that stuff that should be.

1044
01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:27.239
> P4: you know, pretty quick and easy. There, you know. Okay, alright.

1045
01:18:27.900 --> 01:18:47.750
Thomas: And one of the things that we didn't have in the design that that is actually supposed to be there is. When you do get into that contact information with the email and the phone number. There is an alert that's supposed to state that we've pre filled information there. But I do get. Why, you would want that at the very beginning to know that we already have that information. Okay.

1046
01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:48.310
> P4: Yeah.

1047
01:18:48.310 --> 01:18:49.359
Thomas: That makes sense.

1048
01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:51.080
> P4: Well, and and that's

1049
01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:53.180
> P4: that's thing also is.

1050
01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:58.629
> P4: you know, cause you were saying, and I and I like it, you know. Am I calling about myself as the veteran.

1051
01:18:59.090 --> 01:19:08.510
> P4: Am I calling about somebody else, you know. Who? Who's who's checking? Is it? Is it my neighbor's case, the the my neighbor's son? Try and get the information, you know.

1052
01:19:08.510 --> 01:19:09.270
Thomas: Right.

1053
01:19:09.570 --> 01:19:12.679
> P4: Because he's not a veteran, but I am a veteran. So yeah, there's

1054
01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:15.549
> P4: 100 different angles and things on that. So.

1055
01:19:15.550 --> 01:19:36.490
Thomas: Okay. So one one last question that I have, it's very kind of more specific about the 1st element that was that came into focus in on each page. Now, every time you navigated to a new page. That 1st element, you know normally said, what percentage you're complete with the form. Did you find that helpful.

1056
01:19:36.490 --> 01:19:39.820
> P4: Yes, okay. Alright. Yes, yes.

1057
01:19:39.870 --> 01:19:51.270
> P4: because that's a very good anchor. When, like I was saying, where do I start at? I I don't. I have no idea where I'm at on this page. To me this is just a giant white screen, unless I zoom in super huge.

1058
01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:52.000
Thomas: Okay.

1059
01:19:52.000 --> 01:20:03.650
> P4: So getting to that point, even a even though it's a left arrow going back one step, it lets me know where I'm at. Okay, I'm at the beginning of that specific page. And what percentage I'm done

1060
01:20:03.870 --> 01:20:08.549
> P4: with the process. So I think that's a very good thing.

1061
01:20:09.940 --> 01:20:11.550
> P4: you know, again.

1062
01:20:11.780 --> 01:20:22.459
> P4: That's because I'm blind. It gives me that anchor point in it and it. And you know it's it's getting me there visually. I I don't know visually, whether it's worth worth it or not. But I know, for the blind.

1063
01:20:23.540 --> 01:20:30.513
> P4: Getting that like. I say, we gotta have that starting point. You know. Where where are we going from, you know. Yep,

1064
01:20:30.850 --> 01:20:36.909
> P4: sometimes, just for your own knowledge base. You know, you go to a new website. You don't know where you're going to start on that page.

1065
01:20:36.910 --> 01:20:37.970
Thomas: Right, yeah.

1066
01:20:38.130 --> 01:20:42.280
> P4: And this I think I heard on this, which was very good. It said

1067
01:20:42.310 --> 01:20:58.029
> P4: at 1 point it said, Go to Content, or, you know. Click here to go to content, or something like that. Yeah. And that's a great thing, because you don't have to read through all the menus at the top. And you know, Logos and all that stuff right? Yep. So that capability is

1068
01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:59.150
> P4: really good.

1069
01:21:00.340 --> 01:21:11.209
Thomas: Nope, thank you so much for all this feedback. We we've almost reached here at the end of our time. Do you have any additional questions for me about ask Va. Or this research.

1070
01:21:11.340 --> 01:21:26.239
> P4: No, no. And just so, you know, if you wanna keep asking questions that I can help you with, I'm not a I am not on a time constraint, so make sure you get all the information you need. Don't worry about me. I'm I'm golden.

1071
01:21:26.812 --> 01:21:51.190
Thomas: So just to let you know wanted to reiterate, this isn't live yet. So we're still working through the research on this. And all of this feedback is gonna help us to improve what we're doing before it does go live so and and honestly, [P4], if if if we can have you back again, we we still have some additional assistive tech research that we have to do for

1072
01:21:51.190 --> 01:22:07.792
Thomas: another area of this. And I'm really hoping that we can get you back again. We we unfortunately do have a a couple of other things that we have to do today. But I wanna say. And and speaking on behalf of everybody here, we thank you so much for your time.

1073
01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:19.319
Thomas: Perigian will, of course, send you a thank you. Note, with some information to to pass along, and even potentially to other veterans, to participate in future research sessions.

1074
01:22:19.450 --> 01:22:26.690
> P4: Yeah, yeah, I get them. And I try to get involved in all of them. And I I can't remember her name from perigee. And

1075
01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:31.050
> P4: she was very good. Yeah, if you want, if you want me to continue on this specific

1076
01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:36.129
> P4: one, yeah, just ask her to pump it out to me directly, and I will definitely get involved.

1077
01:22:36.130 --> 01:22:41.949
Thomas: Okay, thank you so much, [P4], for for all your time, and I hope you have a a really lovely rest of the day.

1078
01:22:41.950 --> 01:22:46.720
> P4: Thank you guys, I appreciate it so much, all of you folks, for the job you're doing. Cause this is

1079
01:22:46.780 --> 01:22:48.770
> P4: this is really making a change. So.

1080
01:22:48.770 --> 01:22:49.240
Thomas: Yeah.

1081
01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:55.047
> P4: Nobody else ever tells you. It's not easy. I know that it's sometimes a hard road to hoe.

1082
01:22:55.450 --> 01:22:58.780
> P4: But you guys are doing a great job you you truly are, and

1083
01:22:58.830 --> 01:22:59.900
> P4: for all the

1084
01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:05.340
> P4: smacks in the face you get from the wet fishes out there. And you guys are doing awesome. You truly are.

1085
01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:06.500
> P4: Yeah.

1086
01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:08.250
Thomas: Thank you so much. I appreciate it, [P4].

1087
01:23:08.250 --> 01:23:08.840
> P4: Thank you.

1088
01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:10.290
Thomas: Alright, bye-bye.

1089
01:23:10.290 --> 01:23:10.990
> P4: Bye-bye.
