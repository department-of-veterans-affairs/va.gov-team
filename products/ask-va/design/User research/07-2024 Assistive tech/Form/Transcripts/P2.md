### Warm up

Tyler: Okay. So the recording has started, I just want to confirm you're comfortable. If I record my screen and audio today.

> P2: Yes, I am.


Tyler: Okay, awesome. Do you have any questions for me? At this point.


> P2: Just to know why I'm double tapping. And it's not activating at this point. It's not saying like.

> P2: Okay, there you go.

> P2: Okay.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: awesome. And then another thing that's important here is when your screen reader is announcing to you. We can't actually hear what it's announcing. So sometimes I might talk over it, or I might not know that it's saying something to you. And if that happens like, I'm gonna try my best to be quiet as we go through things, but just let me know and it'll probably take a little bit of patience on on both of our parts. And I might ask, you know, more questions. So just so, you know.

> P2: Okay. Thank you.

Tyler: Yeah, no worries. So we're almost done with kind of getting all set up. We have 2 other teammates who are on the line. They're in the waiting room, and they're hoping to just join us to observe. Is it okay if Thomas and Hemesh join the call?

> P2: Yes, that's fine.

Tyler: Okay, awesome. So I'm gonna let them in. They're just gonna say, like a quick verbal, Hello, and then we can get started, so we'll see if Thomas and Hemesh are here awesome. So, Thomas, do you want to just say a quick hello to [P2]?

Thomas: Hello, [P2]! This is Thomas.

> P2: Hello, Thomas! How are you?

Thomas: Good. How are you doing today.

> P2: I'm doing, okay.

Thomas: Great nice to meet you.

> P2: Nice to meet you as well.

Tyler: And then we also have Hemesh here.

Hemesh: Hi, [P2]. I'm Hemesh. I'm a developer on the Ask VA team.

> P2: Nice to meet you.

Hemesh: Nice to meet you, too.

Tyler: Awesome. Okay, that was a lot of information. We've got everybody on the call. I think we're kind of ready to get started.

Tyler: [P2], how long have you been a Veteran?

> P2: I have been a veteran since 2000. I always forget which is unfortunate. Between the [exact date] 2002.

Tyler: Okay.

> P2: 2002. Yes, ma'am.

Tyler: Okay. And did you start interacting with the VA right away in in 2002?

> P2: I would have to say, yes, I was interacting with him while I was in the military still, and then, after the fact, initially afterwards, yes, ma'am.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: These days, when you need to get in touch with the VA, how do you usually get in contact with them?

> P2: I usually go through my healthy vet. I think that's the quickest way for me to access them, because, calling on the phone, you never get through.

Tyler: Right. Okay, that makes sense. So that's an easy way to contact your doctor.

> P2: For me. Yes, ma'am.

Tyler: Have you ever heard of something called Ask Va.

> P2: I literally just was looking that up the other day when I was on there, cause they're saying you have to change your profile. But I didn't go into it too much, but it's something to do with something changing in 2025, or something they were saying. So I'm not too familiar. No, ma'am.

Tyler: Okay, that's no problem at all. Well, today we're gonna talk a little bit more about ask Va, so I'll tell you a little bit about how that works. In a minute.

> P2: Okay.

Tyler: We'd also really love to learn a little bit more about how you're using your assistive technology. How long have you been using a screen Reader?

> P2: I want to say, for, like the last one to 2, between 2 to 3 years, really, because my vision just seemed like it keeps getting bad like to see? Like, so, yeah.

> P2: And I use the voice over [correction: magnification] like a like a lot more than the screen reader. Just so I can, you know, hear in a vision, the magnifying technology, or whatever to make to see. I use that probably more so than the screen reader. The screen Reader becomes annoying when I'm trying to, you know. Yeah. So it's frustrating. But I try.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense. So kind of using the screen magnification more often. And maybe you prefer it. And you said about 2 to 3 years using a screen Reader.

> P2: I have.

Tyler: Okay. And you're on an android today. Right?

> P2: Yes.

Tyler: Okay. Awesome, Jamie, did you have any other questions about tech setup before we continue.

Jamie: I guess I was wondering. Do you know what browser you use? I'm guessing chrome.

> P2: Chrome. The chrome is the one that I use.

Jamie: Alright, cool.

Jamie: Thank you.

> P2: You're welcome.

Tyler: Awesome. So, [P2], now we're all set up where we can see your screen.

> P2: Okay.

Tyler: And what we're gonna do next is we're gonna get you set up with the test website that I mentioned. So there's different ways. I could give you the link for this. I could send it in the chat on zoom or I could just dictate the link to you, and you can type it chrome. Do you have a preference?

Tyler: Sorry, I think I missed that.

> P2: I didn't hear you either. I apologize. You said you to dictate or send it to. Now, my computer want to talk nothing, because

> P2: okay, cause I was trying to get on here. But anyway, you said you was going to dictate it or do what I didn't get the letter of what you said.

> P2: yeah, or send me the link.

Tyler: Yeah, I can send you the link in the zoom chat, or I can dictate it.

> P2: Okay

> P2: again, I'm not familiar with Zoom. So if you want to send the link, we can try it that way.

> P2: Either, or.

Tyler: Okay. Why don't we try opening up, Chrome? Let's try that first.

> P2: Okay.

> P2: I don't know.

> P2: Okay.

> P2: ... on my fingers. Now.

> P2: I'm getting very confused right now.

Tyler: Okay. It seems like it's bouncing around different applications.

Tyler: Do you know how to get to all of your applications? Or do you know how to get to chrome?

> P2: Again. This is my 1st time on here with this. So I don't.

> P2: I thought I clicked on Google Chrome. But it's going to pictures.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: That's okay.

Tyler: If you go back to where you just were on the home screen.

> P2: I'm clicking on all the buttons. But why is it not letting me get back.

Tyler: Yeah, I can see that.

> P2: Am I doing something wrong?

Tyler: I highly doubt that, I think these things can just be very confusing. So why don't we try and get back to the home. I don't know. Maybe it's like the bottom of your screen if you can click the middle button, or maybe you can swipe up.

Tyler: Or if Jamie has other ideas, we can try that.

Jamie: Yeah, I think there's a gesture to go back to the home screen. I think if you swipe up the left kind of like an upside down L.

Jamie: I think that'll get you back.

> P2: I apologize. This is.

> P2: I am trying to get to the home button, Miss Jamie. I don't know why it's not. I mean, I'm tapping you, seeing what I'm doing. The 3 buttons

> P2: like. Why is it bringing me to all these places?

Jamie: I know.

Jamie: Could you just keep if you keep swiping down on this screen? What happens.

> P2: From top to bottom, swiping down.

Jamie: Yeah, yeah.

> P2: It's doing nothing, I mean.

Jamie: Huh! Huh!

> P2: Even from left to right. I tried that before even.

> P2: and that's why I was like even swiping up with 2 fingers, because it's not doing anything.

Jamie: Okay.

> P2: And I put on Narrator on, on my laptop to see cause I've never tried it. When I didn't think the phone wasn't working, and I was trying to do that as well. I don't know if it would help to.

> P2: I don't know cause I never used it on a laptop before, so I apologize like I don't know what what to do. At this point.

Jamie: That's totally okay. I'm gonna look something up real quick.

Tyler: [P2], just to kind of set expectations here it's no stress for us that this might be a little bit tricky to set up. It's not your fault, and it happens most of the time, so I I wouldn't worry.

> P2: Excellent.

> P2: I totally appreciate you all. It's just frustrating, because I'm trying to do both. I wanna help myself and help if it'll make a difference for somebody else. You know what I mean. So.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P2: Don't know why it's doing what it want to do.

Tyler: Yeah, no, I can see how. That's very confusing. The only thing I can really think while Jamie's looking this up is, maybe we can try and just cause. It seems like, whatever you're doing, we are switching between applications. So it seems like, if we could continue doing that, we might end up on a different application that we want to be at.

Tyler: or wait, are we on chrome right now?

> P2: We are my...

Jamie: Yeah, yeah, this is

Jamie: I'm pretty sure this is like your photos App, and there's a way to.

Jamie: To one to like onedrive.

> P2: Right and.

Jamie: Yeah.

> P2: And I don't even know what that thing's trying to do literally, cause I I don't know what. I just not take photos, and

> P2: I don't know the one driving all that. I don't know if I use that. Be honest with you. I see it all the time, but

> P2: I'm just.

Jamie: Again. I understand.

Jamie: if you swipe right and like, keep swiping right?

Jamie: Oh, actually, yeah, do that.

Tyler: Let's do that. Yeah.

Jamie: Okay. And then I swipe left a couple of times to get to the URL bar. Let's do that.

> P2: I apologize. Okay.

> P2: okay, so keep swiping right?

Jamie: Yeah.

> P2: Is that what you are? Okay? Cause I, nothing moving like.

Jamie: Oh, oh, I'm sorry my bad swipe left. I'm so sorry.

> P2: Okay.

Jamie: Okay, try to get you to the top of the screen so you can put in the URL that we're going to give you.

> P2: Okay. Right? Here.

Jamie: Yeah, right there, where it's like login live.com. Okay? Great.

> P2: Okay.

Jamie: There we go! Yep!

Tyler: Okay.

> P2: Okay, so put it in.

Tyler: Yes.

> P2: Put it in.

Tyler: Yeah, perfect. So you're in the right place.

> P2: I apologize.

Tyler: That's okay.

> P2: What did? What do you need me to put in.

Tyler: So now we're gonna type in the URL you're in the right place. So it starts with BIT bit.

> P2: I have BIT.

Tyler: Perfect, and then a period.

> P2: Okay.

Tyler: LY.

> P2: LY.

Tyler: Slash!

> P2: Forward! Slash!

Tyler: Yes.

> P2: Oh, that's the wrong flash, then that's the backslash.

Tyler: Sorry. That's the one you did is right sorry. And then it's ask a SK.

> P2: Okay.

Tyler: Dash.

> P2: Okay.

Tyler: VA

Tyler: oh.

> P2: It was 2. So right, one dash and Va.

Tyler: Perfect. So then we'll try and hit go.

Tyler: Okay, awesome. So it's just loading.

> P2: I think it's delay for me that makes me think that it's not working. But I'm here.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: your feedback's really helpful, because, it's hard for me to tell when

Tyler: you can't hear me.

> P2: Yeah.

Tyler: Or if you're listening to the screen.

> P2: Totally listening. It's just that the screen readers overpowering you.

> P2: Keep. It's like a delay. So yes, ma'am.

Tyler: Yeah, no worries. Okay, is the screen reader talking now.

> P2: And no, ma'am, it is not.

Tyler: Okay, perfect. So let's sit here for a minute. This is awesome. We're all set up.

### Form

Tyler: So I mentioned this earlier. We're gonna pretend like you are signed in to va.gov and what we're gonna do today is observe, as you navigate the website, the good thing is as you get going, we are going to need to talk a lot less, and we're just going to be kind of watching you. And you're going to be telling us things that are confusing or things that are. The screen reader is telling you. So it should get easier as we go along.

> P2: Okay.

Tyler: Before we start. I want to tell you a little bit about this tool. So this is called, ask Va it's a way for veterans to contact the Va and ask a question online.

Tyler: For today's session. We're going to pretend, like you are going to ask the Va. A question about a recent experience you had at a Va medical center.

Tyler: Okay?

> P2: Okay.

Tyler: And I can remind you that scenario whenever you need me to. But essentially, you're asking the Va a question. While you're navigating. You can tell me things that you're thinking and we might ask you questions like, Oh, how did your screen, reader? Explain that that? You know part of the page to us.

> P2: Okay.

Tyler: Do you have any questions for me at this point.

> P2: One question. So you're gonna give me the question, or you literally want me to give you a question versus.

Tyler: Yeah, like.

> P2: And the experience that I had. So which one are we doing.

Tyler: Well, it's kind of up to you. But essentially we, the scenario, is. Your question is, you've recently went to a Va medical center, and you have a follow up question from that experience. So it's up to you. If you want to think of of your own question, or we can give you a question. When we get to that point. Okay.

> P2: Okay.

Tyler: Okay, you, awesome.

> P2: You're fine.

Tyler: Okay, well, let's go ahead and get started. So

Tyler: we're on this page and we're pretending like you're signed in, and you're ready to ask your question. So when you're ready, please navigate, to start submitting your question to the Va.

> P2: Okay? So I'm going to ask a new question, because again, I've never used x.va. This one before. So ask a new question.

> P2: Benefits.

Tyler: So, [P2], when there's a moment to pause, just let me know.

> P2: Okay. When you say, when there's a moment to pause before I proceed to the next screen.

Tyler: Yeah, yeah. Just whenever your screen reader has a has paused for a second.

> P2: Okay. Well, it paused. It's not talking anymore. It was just telling me how to navigate to the next.

Tyler: Okay, perfect. So tell me a little bit about what we just did on the last page. I saw you kind of go through the page, and then you clicked. Continue, what was that page telling you.

> P2: It was pretty. No, I forgot, just because you asked me. Oh, my goodness.

Tyler: That's okay. We can. Also, we can also go back if you want.

> P2: Fit.

> P2: but I think I am going to go back. But from what I gathered initially, it was asking me to pretty much what question did I have to, you know, ask just to go to that question.

> P2: and then it told me to proceed.

> P2: you know, next after I scroll down and read everything on the screen to include the phone number. Because I I do that, I went to continue.

> P2: and that was pretty much it.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: So you noticed the phone number? Was there other information about yourself?

> P2: I don't recall in all honesty I don't recall. Is it okay to go back or.

Tyler: Yes, yeah. You can go back.

> P2: There we go. Okay.

> P2: So now that I'm seeing that I totally missed the social security number to date. Well, I saw it, but I didn't recall when you asked me. So your social security number, your date of birth.

> P2: etc. And denote, if you need it, update your personal information, the number to call.

> P2: Gotcha.

Tyler: Did your screen, reader announce any of that information to you?

> P2: It did not.

> P2: I just read it. That's probably why I missed it. It did not.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. And then it did read the phone number to you. So maybe that's why you remembered that one.

> P2: Possibly.

Tyler: Yeah, cool.

> P2: And bloom.

Tyler: No worries

> P2: You know what you know, what? I apologize. I retract my statement because I scroll down like fast. It actually did read it.

> P2: Whatever you click on. It's reading it to me. I just move too fast because I'm still trying to. Yeah. But it read literally everything. This is your personal information, and when you, when I move floor, it tells me everything. So it is reading it aloud to me.

> P2: My apologies.

Tyler: Well, there's nothing to apologize for that's helpful. Do you think you generally do that when you're on websites kind of like scrolling past information, or you're just getting.

> P2: The hang of using.

> P2: I do because

> P2: I go to what I actually need to do.

> P2: Because I know what I'm going to, and I'm logged in as me. So I know that's all my information. So I just go because I already have a problem when I'm contacting Va. For something that wasn't, you know, taken care of usually, or I need to make an appointment, and thereby. I just go to what I need, and I don't too much, you know, maneuver anywhere else, unless

> P2: I hear about something that I need to investigate. If that makes sense.

Tyler: That totally makes sense. Yeah, I get that. So you're kind of you're task oriented. You're like, I'm here to ask my question. I know, this is my information, like, I'm just gonna kind of skip past this and get going.

> P2: Pretty much.

Tyler: Yeah. That makes a lot of.

> P2: Pretty much.

> P2: Yes, ma'am.

Tyler: Let's go ahead and continue. And maybe before we click, continue or back on any of the pages. We'll just pause for a minute, and then we can chat about it, and then we'll keep going. Does that sound good?

> P2: Sounds great. Yes, ma'am.

Tyler: All right. You go ahead.

> P2: Okay.

> P2: right now, it's saying, loading, loading, loading, heading to form. So it's telling me I was going to this form that I'm on the form.

> P2: So do you actually want me to input like information? We're just going through like a

> P2: pretty much a module like pretend

> P2: cause I'm literal. So it's hard to do. Pretend, if that makes any sense to you.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes.

> P2: Do you want me just to scroll down with the screen, reader, pretty much? Or am I inputting information in here?

Tyler: We're gonna actually input information in this pretend scenario. So your question is, you went to a local Va medical center and you have a question, so I'd love for you to go through the form with that in mind so like, which.

> P2: Okay.

Tyler: Option would you choose knowing that? That's what your question's about.

> P2: I'm sorry

> P2: to a silent technique for me.

> P2: Veteran and officers are very open soon.

> P2: Anthony.

> P2: I'm not really seeing anything that pertains to me going to the Va.

> P2: And having an issue.

> P2: And then to follow up to find out about it. Every none of this is applicable, in my opinion.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. I can totally see that. So we're we've went through the list of options, and we can't find the one that fits.

> P2: Correct.

Tyler: That makes sense?

Tyler: What are you expecting? What type of option are you expecting? What might it say.

> P2: I would really just expect something to be just general or other like follow up question, or, you know, like, or

> P2: some type of

> P2: something to just be really more in layman terms for you went to the Va. And you know you

> P2: reiterate the question once more, because now I'm trying. I'm sorry I have Adhd at the same time, so please reiterate it.

Tyler: Just on.

> P2: Something general.

Tyler: Yeah, no worries. I know it's always a little tricky, because this isn't your real question. So we're pretending like, your question is about getting care at a local Va medical center. So you were recently at a Va medical center. And now you have a question.

Tyler: And that's totally a fair response to say like, this list doesn't have something that I'm expecting.

Tyler: Why don't we choose? Oh, go ahead.

> P2: Health care other than just health care. That will be the only

> P2: the logical one that I would choose on here.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: that makes sense. Let's choose health care.

> P2: Okay.

> P2: okay, I did that mostly.

Tyler: Okay.

> P2: Okay, do you want to pause now? It literally still doing the same thing. The reader is telling me everything that I click on is highlighting and reiterating literally everything that you know. I highlight.

Tyler: Yeah, perfect.

> P2: Okay.

Tyler: We can go ahead and continue.

> P2: Okay.

> P2: at this point it's just telling me it's everything it's loading. So.

> P2: No, I didn't need help. I just was trying to scroll down. Maybe I was moving. I don't know. It wasn't allowing me to move to scroll up and down. So that's why I'm ended up way where I'm at right now.

Tyler: Got it. Okay.

> P2: And it's still doing the same.

> P2: The same thing, like the e-reader is not letting me scroll up.

Tyler: Right.

> P2: Down.

> P2: So I'm kind of stuck at this point. I don't wanna mess up and go out of it, or something.

Tyler: Yeah, no, that makes sense. So it's I'm noticing that you went straight from kind of the top of the page to the bottom of the page, so it wouldn't actually let you get into the to the question, which is a problem.

> P2: Correct cause, even after trying to.

> P2: Yeah, it wouldn't, you know, like, go down to the next one? It just it didn't scroll down it just I was stuck there. I couldn't see the

> P2: you know. The rest of the questions.

Tyler: Okay, got it. Yeah, I think this is an issue that we are aware of. Where your screen reader is not able to basically go and select one of these options.

> P2: Okay.

Tyler: So I'm just gonna check with my colleague real quick to see what we might do here. Okay.

> P2: Yes, ma'am.

Tyler: Okay, so it looks like it could be working again. But it I I'm noticing that for you. We did skip straight over the options, so should we try and scroll up again and see

Tyler: what happens.

> P2: Okay.

Tyler: Okay.

> P2: Okay

> P2: and see what it gives me anxiety, like when I'm trying to do something. I'm being completely honest on

> P2: these apps, because it's I'm I'm thinking it should be working, and you know, and when it doesn't I'll be

> P2: clicked a thousand times somewhere and led myself totally somewhere else that are confusing like, and thinking something wrong.

Tyler: And me.

> P2: Versus you know what I mean versus the app, like, it's just something, you know. So yeah.

Tyler: Yeah, that's like very frustrating, especially when you're trying to get something done.

> P2: Yes, ma'am, which is why I would constantly have this e-reader on. Then take it off and put it back on, because yeah, and try and deal with just seeing the best way I could.

> P2: Let's see. So audio billing co-pays, career.

> P2: family health benefits form up and no getting care at local.

> P2: At this point I'm scared to even scroll down, but.

> P2: I'm gonna try. But I'm looking for me. Based on the question.

> P2: It would be getting care at local VA Medical Center.

Tyler: Okay. So you found an option that works well for you. But you're a little bit apprehensive to like. Go and try and choose it cause it's not seeming like it's working. Is that right?

> P2: That's correct. I'm scared. It's gonna lead me somewhere else. So I don't know what. At this point

> P2: I probably would just click on that one, and then go back through and try again and see enough, and that my brain operate. But as of now.

> P2: I would choose getting to the local gay medical center, because that's pretty much what

> P2: you know. The question is about for me.

Tyler: Right that makes total sense. I'm wondering, Jamie, if if [P2] wanted to choose getting care at a local Va medical center

Tyler: How

Tyler: do would we need to turn? Talk back off

Tyler: in order to do that?

Jamie: It's interesting, because so so, [P2], we were aware of a problem on this page.

> P2: Okay.

Jamie: Then we were just trying it, like a couple of us were trying it on our desktop computers.

Jamie: and it seems to have been fixed

Jamie: in theory this should be working for you.

Jamie: so I'm wondering if you could

Jamie: tap or just double tap on the option getting care at a local Va medical center

Jamie: and see if that works

Jamie: rather than swiping it. Yeah. Okay, awesome. Okay. Great.

> P2: It did a

> P2: right.

Tyler: Okay.

Jamie: And now, if you scroll down to the bottom.

Jamie: does it stay there.

> P2: You see, that's the that's the issue that I'm having.

> P2: It's talking to me again.

> P2: When I do scroll down. It doesn't allow me to like. Go all the way down, like if you see.

> P2: still sharing the screen right? My fingers are here. I'm scrolling down.

> P2: Yeah, but it

> P2: it doesn't let me like go down. I don't even know what I did for it to actually

> P2: go all the way to the bottom of the initial topics.

Tyler: Right.

> P2: So I don't know. Is that me? Or is that a glitch? Because normally

> P2: it would just

> P2: go down.

Tyler: I, yeah, personally, I don't think this is your fault, because we're watching it happen. And it does seem like you're skipping past it, whereas on the other page you didn't have a problem scrolling down.

Tyler: right now, your your focus is on like a back button. So maybe we can swipe up.

Tyler: Yeah, okay. So we're back on the page.

> P2: So do you want me to click the back button is what you want me to do, and go back or.

Tyler: No, let's let's stay on this page.

> P2: Okay.

Tyler: But we want to try and get to the continue button.

> P2: Right.

Tyler: Which I know we're struggling to do, and it's not your fault.

Tyler: Should we try and scroll down once more.

Jamie: Yeah. If you if you do like a 2 like, take 2 fingers and drag like.

Jamie: take 2 fingers, put them on the screen and drag them up. In theory. That'll scroll you down the page.

> P2: That works.

Jamie: Perfect.

> P2: Okay. So and I still don't see any other options other than what I would have chose. So I'm going to go to continue.

Tyler: Okay, perfect.

> P2: I have a question, why is it? Sometimes I can click once on the option and it'll take it, and then sometime I'll click. Usually I have to click once and then double tap for it to highlight.

> P2: but this time it only allowed me one click.

> P2: So if you see me pressing one time and pressing twice it's cause I don't know. It just fluctuates between. Is that what it's supposed to do.

Tyler: you mean, because on this radio button, you just clicked it once and it and it selected myself, but on the last page you had to double tap.

> P2: Alright. I usually have to press it, and then double tap, like once the little box comes around highlighted.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P2: I double tap, and then allow it to, you know, show itself.

Tyler: Right? Okay, that does sound not consistent.

> P2: Okay. Well, I was just letting you know.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P2: So who. Question about myself.

Tyler: Cool.

> P2: Okay. And then I'm gonna proceed to continue. If that's okay.

Tyler: Yeah, that's perfect.

> P2: Okay, I'm the Veteran. It has to be a glitch cause. Yeah.

> P2: I'm the veteran

> P2: and I'm gonna continue again.

> P2: I literally had to tap, then the tap, double tap, then tap again, then double tap, and then it worked like on the 3rd time that I did it.

Tyler: Okay, got it.

> P2: So continue.

> P2: yeah, right?

> P2: Your VA facility. Okay.

Jamie: I have a question. So right now as you're navigating around, are you like swiping to the right to go like to the next thing to the next thing.

> P2: That's what I'm supposed to be doing, that where it works. But when I try and do it, it doesn't work for me. It just actually it. When it I click on. Continue, it'll bring me to the next page. It's not like, see? I'm swiping. I don't know if I it's not allowing me to go from right to left or left to right, so it usually brings me to the next screen. Once it goes to continue.

Jamie: Oh!

> P2: Yeah, I've I was trying to do that before. So I just it. It didn't let me with the screen reader.

Jamie: And when you're swiping left and right, are you using like one finger.

> P2: No, ma'am, I'm using 2 fingers.

Jamie: Okay.

> P2: Do I need to try using one finger?

Jamie: Try up with one.

> P2: Okay.

> P2: so do you want me to finish this part first to search or no, or.

Jamie: Yeah, yeah. Go go ahead. Try using one finger to go between.

> P2: Right.

Jamie: It's here. Okay, when you're swiping around.

Jamie: Okay. Good.

> P2: One finger is not letting me swipe either.

Jamie: All right. It's not.

> P2: Is it another option to do it? Because or is it another place that I'm on the screen like I, even I, I don't.

Jamie: Why is it so right now?

> P2: I'm listening.

Jamie: Oh, go ahead!

> P2: No, ma'am, I'm listening, and I was just gonna say it's always done that with me, though even on my other phone, that when I when I it would, it would go to highlight boxes, and the boxes would change shape and size, and it would never allow me to swipe to a different, to the next page like it's supposed to do.

Jamie: Okay.

> P2: Not just on, so. I don't. I don't know.

Jamie: Well, one thing you can do if you put one finger on the screen and hold it, you can like drag your finger around and it'll move the focus where you want and read it to you.

> P2: Right. It'll let like you said, put my finger cause I tried doing that and put it where I want on the screen, and it'll read it to me. Yes, ma'am, it does that. It just doesn't bring me out of the screen. You know what I mean, where I use 2 fingers or one. It'll do that.

> P2: but it's just not letting me get to the next screen by swiping. I even tried holding it like you said, and and moving it. But it's not letting me do moving.

Jamie: Oh, man! And you and you have had this problem on other websites, too. It sounds like it's not just this.

> P2: Not just no, ma'am.

Jamie: Alright.

Jamie: Well, one thing you can do is to scroll down. Yeah. Where did it go? There it is. If you want to scroll down. You could do 2 fingers and swipe up, and that will help. That'll scroll you down the page.

Jamie: Yeah.

> P2: Okay, so this is where you wanted me to be.

> P2: [Redacted] VA Clinic. That's the one.

Tyler: Yeah. So I just want to pause for a second.

Tyler: I might have misinterpreted some of that between Jamie and and yourself, [P2] so, I'm wondering, did you feel like, after you typed in your postcode, that you should continue to the next page?

> P2: Actually no, what I was trying to do was get to where Miss Jamie said. But when I try and get to it. It did not work for me until she said it and do it again, and then it worked, but I literally tried to use my 2 fingers and scroll up, and it didn't work. So that's what made me click on search. And it yeah, that part.

Tyler: Yeah, okay, that makes sense. I just wanted to make sure to clarify like, whether you were trying to get down the page, or you were wanting to go to the next page, but that makes sense.

> P2: Down, yes.

Tyler: Okay, perfect. And it looks like right away. The 1st option in the list is the one you were expecting to to find right.

> P2: Yes, that's correct.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: Awesome. Well, let's go ahead and and keep going.

> P2: Okay.

> P2: okay, so I'm assuming you can't just click on page 2, you have to click on. Continue, I try clicking on 2 and it didn't move to anything, and then I double tapped it.

> P2: And then it didn't accept it. So it's like ahh, no, I know what I'm doing my apologies.

> P2: It already selected what I needed thereby. I thought it was something different on that page for the different options. So I do need to go to continue that.

> P2: That's me, overthinking.

Tyler: No worries.

> P2: And I don't know why it did that, though. So maybe I do need to go back because I didn't want to click not. Whatever it clicks. I'm going to go back to one.

> P2: okay. So for phone number, just my number. And.

Tyler: What's the information that's filled in on this page already?

Tyler: Why is that.

> P2: My apologies. It's talking.

> P2: Okay. What did you say?

Tyler: No worries. So what what's your screen reader telling you right now?

> P2: It's asking me, it's it. It read out the phone number that's inside the phone number, the box that's highlighted for me to input, my phone number. It just read the number that was inside.

Tyler: okay, and why would there be a phone number already filled in here?

> P2: To show us an example, I'm assuming of how you need to put your phone number in with no dashes or anything to that degree.

> P2: Otherwise I'm not sure why it would be there.

Tyler: What if the obviously this is reading a random phone number right now? What if it read out your phone number? What would you think then?

> P2: Then I would think I've visited the site before that it's just remembered my information.

Tyler: Okay.

> P2: Normally, I wouldn't think it would, unless you would, you know, inform them that it's okay to do so. But if it's a security site, then yeah.

Tyler: Okay. So if it was your information, you'd be like, okay, somehow it's remembered me. This is my correct information. And it might be a little more clear than this random phone number here.

> P2: Yes.

Tyler: Okay, you go ahead and keep going through this page.

> P2: Okay. So leave this information in or put in information.

Tyler: You can leave this information. We're gonna pretend, like, basically, this was filled in because you signed in.

> P2: Okay.

Tyler: But it's just fake information.

> P2: Got you.

> P2: So I will put in, how should we contact you? Because normally, I prefer a phone call. So I could actually talk to a human. So I'm going to click on phone call.

> P2: Okay. Share this information. If you'd like to help us understand the best way to address you. So like all pronouns.

> P2: Okay, if your pronouns aren't listed, you can describe.

> P2: This is different. I've never seen nothing like this before, but I assume

> P2: it's normal now with today's she her her I usually would see Mr. Mrs. Or today. But

> P2: I'm assuming that's fine.

> P2: Otherwise I guess you could input mrs, or you know here. Yeah, for the pronoun, cause I prefer to be [mrs.]

> P2: Is it okay? To proceed.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P2: Okay.

> P2: emails have you understand? Veteran receives mail outside of the United States and military-based that, that wouldn't be applicable to me. So.

> P2: But that's if something is not applicable, but is showing required.

> P2: How do you go across? You know, on the other side of this? If cause yeah, I don't receive mail outside the United States. learn more about military addresses. There's no need for me unless I I would click on it. But I don't know.

> P2: I'm looking at the time, and don't want to keep.

> P2: I know what she said, so I'm trying to get through it at the same time. So. But I would go and read and learn about more military bases, addresses, just to make sure, so I don't know.

Tyler: Yeah, you can click on it. No problem.

> P2: Okay, let's the United States. I'm like children of this country. Okay? No. So that's that does me no justice.

Tyler: Okay.

> P2: So I'm gonna try. And okay, I'm listening.

Tyler: No, no, thank you. So this is helpful. Basically, you come to this page, and you're like, Well, I don't live on a military base. So this doesn't apply to me, but I can see that it's required.

Tyler: and then.

> P2: Right.

Tyler: Extra information didn't help you so you're a little bit unsure.

> P2: Baffled. Yes.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: Okay, so what would you do in this situation if you were like, I don't know what to do. But I want to continue.

> P2: First, I would try going to continue, even though it's required just to see what it would do. So I would click on, continue.

> P2: and once it bring me here.

> P2: the only thing that I would do

> P2: would input my postal code, because that will be the honest and the

> P2: you know the logical thing to do. I mean, I would put in my Zip code is in Mason.

> P2: and it's such a delay like I'm moving with. The reader is like, I'm pressing, and then it says the other thing, and it it is is. It moves very slow.

Tyler: And I thought.

> P2: Yeah.

> P2: And I know it's a way you can go in which I haven't figured on this phone. I know the other ones where you can.

> P2: Really, I don't know if it really you could speed it up

> P2: and make it speak fast, but I don't think that has nothing to do with the delay that that it actually, you know, is given on the app. If that makes sense, it could talk faster. But that's still not gonna resolve the problem again. I'm overthinking. So I'm gonna click on, continue.

> P2: So it did allow me to go to the next one after putting in my Zip code

> P2: the where I actually live, though, so it allowed me to come to this screen.

Tyler: Okay?

Tyler: So you're kind of your backup option in that scenario was. Well, I'll just put in my real postcode and hope that that works, and it did work. But that wasn't straightforward.

> P2: Yes.

> P2: It was not yeah, no, ma'am.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: Okay, go ahead and go through this page. Next.

> P2: To get answers to your question about Va. Benefits and services. 9% reform your question, what's your question?

> P2: My God.

> P2: I really feel like you are. Gonna think I'm slow. I know I went to the Va. Hospital. I'm laughing not to cry. So

> P2: please reiterate the question once more for me.

Tyler: It's totally fine you have to. And if we put it into perspective, I told you about an hour ago what the scenario was. So it's completely, okay.

> P2: You remember.

Tyler: Okay, the scenario is is that you've been to a medical facility recently and you have a follow up question

Tyler: for today. You don't. You can think of a question if you'd like, and we can talk about that. You also don't have to think of a question you could just put in here like test or question, and just put in one word,

Tyler: that's okay as well.

> P2: Okay.

> P2: not 2. I only I only want 1. 0, let's see.

> P2: You see what I mean. It's it's doing like I'm clicking on it and trying to highlight it in order for the reader.

> P2: Okay, but it.

> P2: It's still talking it. Just it's it's just moving slow. So when I'm anxious already, it makes it worse, cause it's it's doing. It's trying to catch up with what I'm trying to actually do.

Tyler: Right. Yeah, I can see how there's a delay.

> P2: Yes, ma'am, the edit. And there and I have no idea why.

> P2: Okay, I'm gonna click. Continue, which is what I'm trying.

> P2: Okay, which is what I'm trying to do.

> P2: Okay. Now it went. Yeah, it. It's a glitch.

> P2: You are only able to edit some answers to this page. You may need to return to an early page in this form to edit some answers, expand all

> P2: question, category, and topic. There was health care and getting care locally. Medical Center. Who's your question about myself?

> P2: What's your question of follow-up questions? Okay.

> P2: what was your relationship to the veteran? I am the veteran information contact.

> P2: Okay? Fake numbers phone call name.

> P2: Okay?

> P2: I clicked on. She her hers. Why, I don't know why it's still showing. Do I need to reiterate this part again?

> P2: If I already put she her hers, it's still showing all the different pronouns.

Tyler: Yeah, and this should be.

> P2: The edit page. So I would think it was. Just show what I actually, you know.

Tyler: I can see why that's very confusing. This page has some issues. That we're still working through. So things like that that you noticed? That is confusing. We agree. And and I think it's helpful to hear, like the behavior that you're expecting.

> P2: Okay.

Tyler: Go ahead and keep looking through the page and tell me if you're noticing anything else that kind of throws you off.

> P2: Okay. Using preferred name. I did say that. Okay.

> P2: if your pronouns aren't listed, you can write them here. Okay? But it was okay, so it pretty much just reiterate the options again. But it didn't put what I actually would, you know, want it to be.

Tyler: Right.

> P2: List, which is miss. Okay, I see that.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: no, but that makes sense. So you were like, you've already made a choice which was to put Ms.

Tyler: so you're surprised that it's showing the other options which makes sense.

> P2: Well, not not list, not even that. The fact that it was she, her and hers, that one, and then to still show all the other ones. It's just how my brain works. I don't see a problem with it, but it's just the way my brain works. If that makes sense, it makes sense.

Tyler: Makes sense. Yeah.

> P2: Yeah.

Tyler: And like, I said, I think we've noticed some of these issues, too. We're just still working on that page. So that's okay.

Tyler: why don't we go ahead? Is there anything else you want to talk about on this page?

> P2: No, ma'am.

Tyler: Okay, let's go ahead and submit your question.

> P2: Okay.

> P2: that's about the confirmation. So it gives you the confirmation number, and they'll also send the email you should receive or reply by phone call within 7 business days. If you need more information to answer your question, we'll contact you.

> P2: It's very accurate, though, when it's reading and highlighting. And it. It really says everything that I'm trying to see. You know what I mean. So that's helpful.

> P2: Okay. So at this point I would assume that it's over because I received the confirmation number. Then I would probably log out at this point.

Tyler: Okay. Awesome.

> P2: Wait for a response.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: So you said, you feel like it's really accurate. It's reading out to you kind of everything on the screen. You feel clear.

> P2: Yes, ma'am.

Tyler: Finish the process. And now you'd probably sign out.

> P2: Yes, ma'am, it's just the delay. That's yeah.

Tyler: Yeah, for sure. The delay with the typing was was kind of an obvious frustration which which makes total sense.

Tyler: we did really well with our time. We do have like about 10 min to just kind of reflect on that process.

> P2: Okay.

Tyler: It's up to you prefer to come back so you can see my face again. We can stop sharing your screen or you can leave it like this if you don't want to. Kind of mess with that.

> P2: I'd like to try.

Tyler: Okay.

> P2: See if it's gonna

> P2: yeah, allow me to... you see, now, it's allowing me to scroll. Do you see this.

> P2: Do you see what it's a let me get back to you guys now, before it wasn't let me go left or right.

> P2: It made me think again that I was doing something wrong. But it's highlighted, and I see you again. This is really awesome. But I really feel like you taught me how to use it on this phone now. So thank you for real. Thank you. I feel more comfortable.

> P2: I'm gonna have to call both of you back, though, when it start messing.

Tyler: Well, I'm glad that that was helpful, because, that's why we invite Jamie for the session. So hopefully, we both. We all get something out of it.

Tyler: Awesome. So now you can see my face right?

> P2: Yes, ma'am.

Tyler: Okay, perfect you can stop sharing your screen if you like, but you don't have to. I think maybe it would be if you if you swipe to the like right?

Tyler: it might let you like on my video.

> P2: So tap on your video.

Tyler: That that looks close. So sorry it's probably left. So try the same thing again and go left and then we'll go left again.

Tyler: No, okay.

Tyler: no, that's all right. Okay, we. I'm not exactly sure how we do it. There might be.

> P2: I'll stay looking at you. I'm not worried about the sharing as long as I can see you, and we can talk. We're fine.

Tyler: Okay.

> P2: I'll learn that on zoom...

Tyler: Yeah, another day. We've learned enough today.

> P2: Yes, ma'am!

### Cool down

Tyler: Okay, well, that was really helpful. We went through the whole form, which is awesome. So let's spend just a little bit of time reflecting on that.

Tyler: you know, right off the bat. How was that experience for you?

> P2: Initially.

> P2: I was nervous because I don't like being unprepared, and it's like everything wasn't working. But when I got into the swing of it. And you all started helping me with the phone on this phone. It was easy to navigate through. And

> P2: the application process. It wasn't. It wasn't bad, either, that the axe.gov. It's a new site, but

> P2: I hope that you know it. They actually respond. It's not even the site, the issue. The site was more so great then not if that makes any sense. It was just a few little glitches with the reader that was kind of frustrating, but for the most part I don't think I don't see it as a big issue.

> P2: It's just a response time from VA Would be the issue for me in all honesty.

Tyler: Yeah, okay, cool. So overall, using the website wasn't too bad. There was a couple of little bumps with the the screen. Reader. As you're kind of getting used to it on your new phone especially, but.

> P2: Yeah.

Tyler: It worked pretty well, and then it you kind of it kind of made you curious, maybe, to use this in the future and hear what the Va. Would would reply, and things like that.

> P2: It did.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P2: I would totally agree with what you're saying. Yes, ma'am.

Tyler: That's good, I think, overall that's like fairly good feedback.

Tyler: There was obviously some challenges with your screen reader, like we we talked about the delay with when you were typing, and there was, it was difficult to scroll down on a lot of the pages. Is there anything else that comes to mind when we think about what was difficult.

> P2: The swiping left swiping right. That wasn't working for me as well, until

> P2: again, I don't know if if it's a glitch in the the system or the delay with me moving too fast. But I know I know I tried it. Multiple times like you all were watching me, and I'm I'm swiping. It's like, what am I not doing right? Why isn't it not, you know. Isn't it moving so other than that? Then?

> P2: Yes, ma'am, I think it was. You know it was a smooth process for me. I didn't leave crying.

Tyler: Well, that's good. We try, and we try and keep it that way.

> P2: I'm just, yes, ma'am.

Tyler: That makes sense, though. I mean, I think one of the annoying or the kind of like the maybe frustrating things about using technology like this is that, it's not clear for you if you're doing something wrong, or if the the screen reader is doing something wrong, or the website is doing something wrong. So it's a lot of figuring out what's going on. Did I do something wrong? And and we saw that today which makes sense.

> P2: Yes, ma'am.

> P2: Actually my life. That's me!

Tyler: Need to know. I need to.

> P2: Sort of source I need to understand. So thank you both.

Tyler: I'm curious. Have you had any experience using talkback or or a screen reader in general that went really? Well? Maybe on a different website or application, or your old phone.

> P2: How can I answer that... hmmm if I had a really good experience, a good experience I would consider with talk back would be just no glitches. You know what I mean.

> P2: And for the for the it. It went smoothly. I didn't have to worry about it, and it it read back.

> P2: So it was easier. It's kind of like it kind of reminds me of the

> P2: E-read. I always forget what this thing is called with the e-reader. But the same difference is just that when I don't have any glitches, I'm okay.

Tyler: Is there any website that you frequent where that's the case?

> P2: School. The University of Phoenix. So it it helps for school. That I would normally be on to do my research, etc, like that. It helps back to read back to me.

Tyler: Okay. Okay. Awesome.

Tyler: Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: That's that's really helpful.

Tyler: when we were going through the form just in general, maybe thinking a little bit less about the assistive technology for a second. Did you encounter moments where you were like? I don't really know how to answer this question, like, for example, the postal code was one that we talked about. Was there any other?

> P2: Yes, ma'am.

> P2: I mean everything pretty much, was it went well, I kind of like had the question when we what was it when I couldn't?

> P2: It wasn't even about scrolling the scrolling down part. It was nothing about the question itself. Everything was pretty much easy, easy to understand. It wasn't difficult, so I would have to say, no, ma'am, I just thought too hard on the zip code ordeal with the United States other than that. No, I can't recall.

Tyler: Okay, yeah, that that makes sense. That kind of fits how it felt. Watching you go through the form. Like. Usually it was pretty quick for you to say I'm the veteran. Move on to the next page.

Tyler: Which is good.

Tyler: Did you feel like you had a sense of how long the form was going to be?

> P2: Honestly, no.

> P2: I really didn't, because I was. So. I was between trying to make the phone work for me.

> P2: That my mind wasn't really on the extent of how the duration of how long it would take me. I didn't balance it out normally, if it was just, you know, a smooth flow with the phone like I said, no hiccups.

> P2: I would say it would have took probably less than 10 min to complete the form, if that much depending on you know, your input too, and your question, etc. But for the most part no, ma'am, I didn't see it because I was too. Yeah.

Tyler: That's that's totally understandable. One, because obviously there's a lot going on right now. You're on a zoom call, and you're filling out a form and doing a lot of different things at one time. I have a specific question. So

Tyler: on each page, when we would get to a new page the screen reader would read what percentage complete you are with the form. So, for example, it would say, 20% complete with the form

Tyler: Did you? Did you find that helpful? Did you notice it? Did you not really.

> P2: Oh! I totally.

Tyler: Shame.

> P2: I noticed it I noticed it, but because again, how my brain works despite it, telling me for me it would be no need to reiterate it.

> P2: because I know where I'm at in the form by it, telling me and guide me through the steps of where I'm at. I'm already knowing I'm getting to the end. So I didn't really see it as immensely purposeful. You know what I mean, but it it would help if a person couldn't hear to that degree, you know as well I think it. It needs to be there, but for me it just it really was neither here nor there, if that makes sense.

Tyler: I think that makes sense. So you're saying like it wasn't really helpful or unhelpful.

> P2: Yes, ma'am.

Tyler: It's not very necessary. And is that because you weren't really like that bothered about how far you were in the form, or why, exactly was that not neccessay?

> P2: For me, because when I start something I'm upfront and honest with it, like I stated to you all before I came on, and I'm going to get the job done, because that's just how I'm programmed. So I'm going to get it done.

> P2: That's the best way I can explain it to you. I mean, I'm intentional about it, but I don't want to waste people time, and I don't like. I don't wanna be in the way. And I don't want. I just want to get it done. So I'm gonna finish it. If that makes sense. I'm just gonna get it done.

Tyler: That makes sense. So you're like, it doesn't really matter how long it is, because I'm just gonna do it.

> P2: Do it. Yeah, yes, ma'am.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: What about like when we got to each page. So you know, each page had kind of a focus, right? Like one was postingAnd one was, you know, who is your question about... Did it feel clear what the focus of each page was once you arrived.

> P2: Most definitely. It was very clear like, Who are you? I'm the veteran, are you not the vet? It was very to the point. I'm just using that particular page because it stands out to me, and it's easy to remember versus the question that was put out there I could not recall. But yes, ma'am, was very much. The focal points were all there.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P2: I think so.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. And then this is going to get really specific and very hypothetical. But let's just try it. So on each page we arrive, and the 1st thing the screen reader would say to you is 20 complete with form, right.

> P2: Yes.

Tyler: And what if on each page you arrive? And the screen reader would say to you the the kind of title of that page? So instead of 20% complete with form, it would say topic or it would say, You know, who is your question about. What would be more helpful?

> P2: There's a question about.

> P2: I'm thinking about, not just me, but my elders, Veterans as well. So

> P2: we know it's about us pretty much. It's like understood, because we're the one asking the questions unless it's a husband or wife.

> P2: But usually no one's supposed to sign into your healthy vet, or any type of thing other than yourself. So that should be understood, if that you know, in my opinion. So I think versus you understand to that degree like nobody should be handling nothing but you. So it's about you. So I would say that would be unnecessary.

> P2: but the topic

> P2: might help.

> P2: But I think the way you all have it set up is pretty much self explanatory, anyway, to where it's still a target.

> P2: who it's about and what it needs to be in the question, or whatever's involving, and you know where you need to go it. It's like you have a topic. Then you have the subtopic. So it all flows. I mean I have no.

> P2: Can't refute that. So the best thing that I would say it's just for those like, you know, some people just need to know where they are and just how long they have. I think that's the best option for me. I would think that, despite me not needing it neither. You know there, cause I'm the finisher. If I started.

> P2: I think I think it's good the way it is.

Tyler: Okay.

> P2: Like that? Starting with the yeah.

Tyler: That makes sense. So, even though that might not be something you're paying close attention to, you think it could guide people through the form.

> P2: Yes, ma'am.

Tyler: That makes sense.

> P2: You know, like, yeah, the people like multitask and like, especially when your elders, they just, you know they they need to know certain things you know to see, and you know I I still have not done yet, and it might alert them. You know what I mean. Okay, I still have this much, and no, I'm not finished yet, so.

Tyler: I think.

> P2: Be helpful, you know, like that.

> P2: Before. They just think that it's finalized. They submitted their question or anything, you know, like that. And they wonder why they never got help or return phone call or return email, whatever. But they didn't finish it. You know. It might help you have a button and be like, Oh, okay, we've completed. The job is in that sense, you know, even though it gives you the confirmation number, you know. But I think that would be helpful.

Tyler: Yeah, that's a really good scenario that you brought up where someone's like not sure, if they've finished the form without that information saying, like, you're only.

> P2: Right.

Tyler: Complete. So that that makes a lot of sense to me.

> P2: Yes, ma'am.

Tyler: I think you've answered all of my questions. Did you have any other things that you wanted to share about? You know this tool that we looked at today.

> P2: Now that I feel comfortable on this phone doing it was helpful. And I think I'm going to utilize it more. Now you know what I mean, because I got back from it got back, and it cause it was very frustrating.

> P2: But now I just thank you all. I have no further questions. I just thank you all for being patient. So you know, go through the process as well with me. So no, ma'am, no questions.

> P2: This was a great experience for me as well. I've learned now how to utilize the XI Gov. I'll be going to that site as well because I wasn't familiar with it.

Tyler: Yeah, awesome. Well, that's we love that cause we really appreciate you spending the time with us because we learn a lot from these conversations. Like you found things that we might need to pay closer attention to. That's really really helpful. But it's like a definitely an awesome bonus. If you also feel like you get something out of the conversation.

Tyler: So that's great.

> P2: Indeed.

Tyler: So let me just tell you, before we finish the website that we looked at is still in the works. So it's currently it's not on va.gov yet. But it will be on va.gov in the in the future. And it'll be a way for you to ask the Va questions online. It'll work very similarly to what we looked at today. So that's something to look forward to.

Tyler: If you wanted to use it right now. It's not. It's not great with screen readers at the minute, which is kind of why we're working on it. So it might not be the best option right now, but but hopefully, in the future it'll be something that you might be able to to enjoy using.

Tyler: We'll do

Tyler: awesome. Well, thanks so much for your time, [P2]. This was this was really useful, like I said, and we we made the most of our time together. So I appreciate that. The folks who set up the research session are going to send you a thank you. Note. It'll have information. You can pass on to other veterans if they want to participate. And and I think that's everything for me.

> P2: Well, thank you all kindly, and I hope you have a wonderful rest of your days.

Tyler: Yeah, you, too, have a lovely rest of your day.

> P2: Thank you.

Tyler: Thanks, bye.

> P2: Goodbye!
