Researcher: Okay. Now, now that I've started the recording, can you please again confirm that you're comfortable with us recording the session today?

P10: Yes.

Researcher: Okay. Great. Well, thank you for that, and we are still waiting for our observer here, so let me real quick check on that.

P10: I only have an hour, so I don't know, hopefully we can get started.

Researcher: Yeah, yeah, that's totally fair. Then I'll just say our observer will probably join us at some point, and yeah, we'll go ahead and get started. So, I guess before we do get started, though, do you have any questions for me?

P10: No.

Researcher: Okay. Okay, so in the initial survey, you indicated that you're using VA education or training benefits. Can you tell me more about how you've used those benefits?

P10: The VA educational benefits, I've used, some of those benefits to take some online courses. In the past.

Researcher: Okay. Did you experience any challenges receiving these benefits?

P10: No, I didn't have any issues.

Researcher: Okay. And have you contacted VA for any kind of support? So, not necessarily just about education, but any kind of support in maybe, say, like, the last 6 months or so?

P10: Yes.

Researcher: Can you describe, maybe, your most recent experience with contacting VA for support?

P10: I contacted my, primary care provider to get a, chair for my shower, so I could sit down.

Researcher: Okay. And what was your experience contacting support to help you with that?

P10: She… no problems. She complied with it and had it sent to me within a week.

Researcher: Hmm. And how did you contact them?

P10: online, through the VA, myVA Health, or the VA.gov now, but the VA.gov site.

Researcher: Okay. And so was that, like, through email, or… How did you… do you know.

P10: I know exactly.

Researcher: Like, how you contacted them?

P10: It's a messaging app through the VA. Okay. You go through the messages, you log in and go to your messages online, and you can send the message to a primary care manager, or anyone within the VA system you can send messages to. Yeah.

Researcher: Okay. Okay. And have you ever used a tool called AskVA?

P10: I've seen it, but I don't think I've ever actually used it, no.

Researcher: Okay. Okay. Great. Well, thank you for just giving me a little bit more context around, kind of, your experience with education benefits and support. That just helps me to, kind of, understand where you're coming from. I do see my observer has joined the waiting room, so I'm gonna go ahead and admit her and have her do just a quick introduction.

P10: Okay.

Researcher: And then we'll… we'll continue on with our session. Hi, Stephanie! I'll have you go ahead and come off, video and mute real quick, and just do a quick, kind of one-line introduction of yourself, if you can. You might not be able to hear us. Stephanie, can you hear us? Okay, I can do a quick introduction for her, Benny, just to make sure you know, kind of, who you're in the room with. Stephanie is the product owner on a digital support tool, so she's on my team, and she's going to be observing and taking notes for us today.

P10: Okay.

Researcher: Okay, so we'll go ahead and continue on now. I wanted to move into the next part of this session, Alright, she just put it in the chat that she's having some issues. So, I'm gonna be providing you with some different scenarios and tasks to walk through, and in order to kick us off with that, I wanted you to share your screen with us at this point. So, if you look at the Zoom window at the bottom, there's a green share button. It's like a green square with an arrow in it. So I'll have you share your screen with us, and then I'll be providing you with a link.

P10: I don't have a green button at the bottom of my screen.

Researcher: And it might be under more. There's, if you look at Zoom, there's sometimes, like a three dots in a circle with more options.

P10: Got it.

Researcher: Okay, and then share should be within there, if you can find that.

P10: I got it.

Researcher: Awesome. Okay, it looks like it is starting to share then. Okay, perfect. So, I… if you can navigate back to the Zoom window, I just posted a link in the chat. That you should be able to click on, and it should open up in the browser that you, are showing right now.

P10: You said navigate back to the Zoom window. Okay, how did I do that?

Researcher: Let's see… Yeah, so it should be, like, where we were video chatting, so I'm not sure if you… I think it might be underneath your browser?

P10: I got it. Okay. Okay.

Researcher: Yeah, so there's… yeah, there's a chat window, that has a link in it, and if you click on it, that should open up Think in your browser, right there. Or you can copy it and paste it into your… your web browser as well. Okay, great, it looks like it's coming up now. So I'll go ahead and kind of prompt you through the scenario. So, imagine that you've already logged in to your va.gov account. And you're having issues with a work-study benefit. You've been directed to ask VA to get help with this issue. Before you click on anything to complete this task, take a second to look around and talk out loud about what it is that you're seeing here.

P10: Saying it says, get answers to questions about the VA Benefit Services, and it tells you that, I will receive a reply within 7 business days. It takes about 2 to 5… 2 to 15 minutes to complete, and we can pre-fill some of the information. Since you're signed in, you know, that I can pre-fill some of the information based on my profile details. You can also save the information and come back later to finish filling it out if necessary, and it has a button to ask for… ask questions, or ask new questions. Okay, and answer your questions.

Researcher: What are your expectations with AskVA so far?

P10: So far, so good. Seems to be straightforward and clear about what's gonna happen, and when I should get responses, and the link is there for me to ask a new question if I have a question, so…

Researcher: And how long would you expect it to take to get help that you need through SBA?

P10: 7… at least, no more than 7 days.

Researcher: Okay. Now, go ahead and show us how you would use AskVA to get the help you need.

P10: Okay, I would click on the Ask New Question link, and… I would check my information, make sure that it's correct name, social security number, date of birth, if that is correct. Then I… I would continue. Then it says, I'll pick the category that I want to ask the question about, so I would click on the categories and pick one. You want me to pick one and just keep going, or what you like?

Researcher: So imagine you're having an issue with your work-study benefits. How would you go through and find help on that?

P10: So I would look for something that applies to work study, let me see… decision on appeal, veterans' employment, burial, pension. Benefits aside, defense. Okay. You said work-steady benefit. 8567… I don't see… I don't see anything dealing with, work-study benefits. Maybe it's under a different name?

Researcher: And what would you do here if you couldn't find something that related to your question?

P10: I would go back out and see if there's an option for me to put in my own. I can't… can't get back to that. I would try to get back to… Why is it… oh, come on.

Researcher: Yeah, I think I'll… hold on one second.

P10: Let me see if I can escape, maybe that's what it, what happened. Anyway, if I… if I could get the screen to work, I would.

Researcher: Yeah, I might actually have you go back to the Zoom window and click on the Zoom window.

P10: Okay.

Researcher: Something happens. Yeah.

P10: Mmm… Okay, I'm back in it now. It's working again. So, let me see… I'm gonna click on healthcare, see if that works. Did it lock up? Hello.

Researcher: I'm still here.

P10: Oh, oh, okay. Did something happen where it locked? It's not allowing me to do anything right now.

Researcher: Yeah, so I guess, I think I asked this a little bit, like, what might you do… you said you would try to go back?

P10: Yeah, I would get up. If you couldn't find an option. Right, I would go back and see if I could… Type in something on my own. If I couldn't, I would try to pick something as close as possible, too. my question that I have, let's see if I can freehand, you know, type in specifics once I got there.

Researcher: One of those two things, that's what I would try to do. Yeah, so maybe, I can give you kind of a slightly different scenario. So maybe imagining you had an a question about, like, your training, or your certification, or your, like, your online classes that I know you've, you've done. How might you go about, Getting help with that.

P10: Okay, let me see… Okay, here we go. I would click on the Education Benefits and Work Study. Then I would click continue. And then I would pick the topic that applies to what I want, education benefits, so… I will just check. if there's one specific to what I'm looking for, There it's work-study, and now it's there. But, okay.

Researcher: So how do you interpret this list that you're seeing?

P10: It's a lot to pick from. I mean, I would take… I mean, it would take me a minute or two to kind of go through it, and… to, determine which one applies to what I… what I need to get assistance with. So like you said, educational, so I see something that talks about educational, but benefits. Certificate of eligibility. I would have to know specifically what my issue is. I mean, what you're asking me is kind of general, but… If my issue was with, you know, getting my money, or if I'm eligible, I could click on Certificate Eligibility, if that was my issue. if I was looking at for, you know, the cost of fees, I would click on testing fees, Let me see…

Researcher: And how important do you think these questions are?

P10: They are… they're important, very important. I mean, I think these rely… I mean, relate to specific issues that someone may have. If they, you know… I think it's very… versus, well, no, not comprehensive is the word I'm looking for. It's very comprehensive as far as the different topics and things that it covers, dealing with educational benefits. Of all the different types, I think it's a good one. The list of, list of topics.

Researcher: Okay. And again, on this particular page, what would you do if you couldn't find an option that fit your needs?

P10: I would go back.

Researcher: anymore.

P10: I would see where it says… if I can… no, I'll take that back. If… if I couldn't find a… a topic that fit my needs. I see need help, call us now. I would… I would call that number.

Researcher: And, and, and ex…

P10: tell the person what I'm looking for, get some assistance, and go from there.

Researcher: Okay. So again, if we imagine that you were, trying to get help with your work-study benefits, how would you go about doing that?

P10: I would click on Work Study, and then I would click Continue. And… It says your category of topics. I read through education benefits work study. The topic is work-study, which is correct. Then it says subtopics. I would pick the one that applies to my issue, was application, general questions, position, description. Signing contract or time card. So, maybe mine would be a general question, then I would click on general question and type the specific issue that I'm having. And I would say, what it says, what is your relationship to the veteran? Of course, that would be, I'm the veteran. I would continue, then I would select… The state where my school is located. It wouldn't be… wouldn't be there, but Okay, I guess that's just the only option here, let me see. Yeah, so if it… my, you know, my state was California, of course, that would be where I would select. If it's not… I don't know if this is a demo or not, but… It's not selecting me… allowing me to select any other state. But I would pick the state that applies to me, and then I would pick the residence, the state school, excuse me, then the residency state, I would pick that, and… whatever it might be. I'm assuming this is a… I'm assuming this is a demo, so then I would click continue, because it's not allowing me to… Select a state where you currently live. Should he be doing that, or not? I guess.

Researcher: Yeah, what would you expect it to do there?

P10: It should have a drop-down for both of them. It should be a drop-down for me to select the appropriate The appropriate answers, like, where the school is located. Where I currently live, there should be a drop-down that allows me to pick the right Location for both, but it's…

Researcher: Okay.

P10: Yep, and if it's not doing that, then again, at the bottom, I would have to call to try to find out what's going on.

Researcher: Hmm. Okay.

P10: I can… well, then I just… I can continue. My contact information, phone number, email, then my preferred name. I would type that in, click continue. And then that's where I can type in my specific question that I might have. So, if it was dealing with workstatic payments, yes.

Researcher: Yeah, so here, yeah, in our prototype, we're not able to have you type into these fields, but I would be interested in understanding, for maybe your own perspective, what you would type into either of these fields here.

P10: Again, the subject would be what my issue is. So, if my issue is my payment, I think you said payments with the work study, I would say Issues with work-study payments. That's what I would type. I have issues, or issues with my work-study payments. And then my question would be, specific to Similar to what you see right here. I haven't been paid for X number of hours for my work study, V8 work-study, or it could be I didn't get the adequate amount based off the hours I worked. I need assistance with getting my correct pay. So, I would… I would write this specific question relating to my issue in there. Your questions. What are your questions?

Researcher: And how do you differentiate what to put in, each of these two boxes?

P10: about the titles, subject, and then what is… what's your question? I just follow the titles of the, boxes.

Researcher: Yeah, and how do you, maybe think about, like, what you would type into these two things differently? Like, how does it differ, what you would put into the subject versus the what's your question?

P10: Well, the subject is just a general statement about what my issue is. I'm not going into great detail in the subject. I'm just putting enough information in there so the person would know what I'm going to talk about in the next block, my specific questions. So I would not go in detail in this subject. It would be very similar to what we see on the screen. And then in my, my specific questions, where I would go into great detail about whatever my issue is. Ask for assistance based off that.

Researcher: Okay. And, you know, based on your previous experience, like, with getting questions answered, or working with the VA. Could you give me an example of what you might type in here? In both of those fields.

P10: I think I said it, but I'll go over it again. So, the first one I said I would type in, Need assistance with, work-steady payments.

Researcher: Issues with work-study payments, something to that effect.

P10: Then in my, what's your question? My question would be. I mean, I'm making this up, of course.

Researcher: Yeah, but that's what I was asking, is, like, maybe based on, like, a situation you've been dealing with that you would maybe want to ask a question on, could you kind of talk through what you would type in here for, like, a situation that you've experienced, as opposed to kind of what's in there as an example?

P10: Oh, okay, alright, I'm sorry, I got you. Let me think of one. my… I have an issue with, getting proper medical care, so… My subject would be requests. A specialty assistant with my medical condition. And then my question, my specific question would be. Not going into great detail, of course, it would be, I'm having… X number of symptoms, and I've been having these symptoms for over 8 weeks. I've contacted my primary care manager. And she or he is not able to assist me any further. I need to contact a patient advocate or somebody within the VA hospital to assist me, because… My symptoms are getting worse. Please provide guidance and direction on who I need to contact.

Researcher: Okay. And maybe in that instance, or any other instance, can you maybe describe a scenario where you might want to attach a file? To a question like that.

P10: And same one, I would say, based off my primary care manager, my labs are normal. However, I have attached my lab results, and… and note the 3 labs I have highlighted, they are not normal, so… Please use this as a reference to provide the additional support I'm requesting, or assistance I'm requesting.

Researcher: Okay. Okay. Thank you for providing, kind of, the context of… of this, like, for something that's directly relevant to you. That's… that's really helpful to just understand your… your overall, like, how you would use this. Yes. You can go ahead on, and if there's anything else you wanted to say about this page, but go ahead and continue on to get the help you need.

P10: Okay. Alright, you don't… You are only able to edit answers on this page. So, then it says you may need to return. to an earlier page in the form to edit some answers, okay? So it's allowing me to edit, if I need to, my… what I've written. Category topics and who your question… who your question is about. Excuse me. So those are the things that I've, I've, typed in previous pages, I'm going through it to make sure that everything is correct. School, of course, I'm checking all my data, information that I have inputted in this system to make sure it's accurate. If it's not accurate, I can click on the edit button and make changes. I could also check my attachment to make sure it's the correct attachment, and then if everything is accurate and correct, I would go submit questions. And… It lets me know my questions have been submitted successfully, which is what I want to see. It gives my reference number that I would write down or take a picture of, so I'll have it if I need to refer back to it at a later date. And I would wait 7 days, and hopefully I get an answer to my question. No issue.

Researcher: So, on a scale from 1 to 5, how easy or difficult was it to complete this task? 1 being very difficult, and 5 being very easy?

P10: 4.

Researcher: Okay, and on a scale from 1 to 5, how satisfied were you with this process? 1 being very unsatisfied, and 5 being very satisfied. Okay. Can you expand a little bit more on, the rating that you provided for both of those?

P10: I say 4, because of the issues I had with the screen, something happened with the screen that delayed me in figuring out what was going on, and it's kind of a little frustrating. And then the second question was… because… there's a lot of topics to go through, you know, and if I'm… If I'm frustrated about the issue, you know, it just adds a little bit more frustration, because there's so many different topics, which is good, but it's still… it takes some time to kind of figure out what… what applies to your issue. Since there's so many different things to cover, I mean, that's good and bad, but That's what I said a 4.

Researcher: Okay. And how do you feel about the length of the form that you just completed?

P10: Oh, it's fine. The length is fine. I think it's okay.

Researcher: And was there anything in particular that you liked about asking a question through Ask VA?

P10: Mmm… I did. Actually, I did like that it did have a drop-down, so… At least I can maybe… find what I'm looking for. Instead of trying to figure out, you know, instead of trying to having to call for help. Hopefully that my issue was within those topics.

Researcher: And was there anything in particular that you didn't like?

P10: No. Not at all.

Researcher: Okay. And what would you do next after submitting your question? You did start to talk through this when we got to this page, but I wanted to ask it more explicitly.

P10: Again, I would make sure it's submitted successfully, like it shows, and then I would make sure I have the reference number written down. And then I would make sure I have the number to call for help if I don't get a response within 7 days.

Researcher: And what would you expect AskBA to do next?

P10: To respond within 7 days to my… with an answer, you know, follow-up to my question.

Researcher: Okay. Did you have any other thoughts about, kind of walking through, this form that we just went through?

P10: No.

Researcher: Okay. I'm gonna go ahead and move us on to our second task. So if you are able to go back into Zoom. There's a second link that I have… Added to the chat, so you should be able to click on that.

P10: Okay. I do have an additional thing. I don't know why I gotta wait 7 days. I would think that's a little long. I mean, to me, it shouldn't take 7 days to get a response. That's… That's my only other issue.

Researcher: Yeah, how long would you expect to get a response here?

P10: Three to four days.

Researcher: Yeah, thanks for providing that additional feedback.

P10: Okay. You said go back, because I gotta figure that out.

Researcher: Yeah, if you can go back to… to your Zoom window, I think maybe… yeah, I can't… I don't see your whole screen, so…

P10: Oh my god.

Researcher: any issues.

P10: I just… just trying to figure out which button to push, that's all.

Researcher: I think you might be able to… because are you just still seeing this, our prototype, here?

P10: Yes.

Researcher: I think at the very top right, there's some arrows that are pointing to each other. I think that we are looking at this full screen, so yeah, if you minimize that… yeah, there we go. So, you can go ahead and exit out of that browser window if you want. All the way… yeah, all the way up at the top, though, I mean, you can… You can close out of this browser. And get back to Zoom, where I've got a second link in our Zoom chat.

P10: I'm just trying to make sure I don't shut down the Zoom itself. I don't want to click.

Researcher: Oh.

P10: buttons.

Researcher: you should be able to, the X at the top right, In the, kind of, blue bar there, you should be able to exit out of that.

P10: Got it.

Researcher: Yeah, okay.

P10: Okay, I'm back.

Researcher: Okay. So, there is a second link there. If you're back into Zoom. Perfect. Alright, so I'll kind of… as that logs in, I'll kind of prompt you with our next task. So, again, imagine that you've already logged in to your VA.gov account. And it's been maybe a month or so since you submitted that question. In that time, you may or may not have answered other… or submitted other questions through AskVA, but show us now how you would go back in order to see that specific question about your work-study benefits.

P10: Okay, so… I'm assuming they responded within the 7 days, is that what you're saying?

Researcher: Kind of walk through what you would expect and what you see here.

P10: Did you hear my question?

Researcher: Yeah.

P10: You didn't answer it.

Researcher: Yeah, I kind of want to, like, as you see, things here, kind of hear what you think, and maybe you might be able to answer your own question. So I'm curious, kind of, what you… what you think is the case with that.

P10: Okay, so I'm looking for a response to my question. So I'm going down to say… I'm looking at the, the different questions here, in progress or new. Submitted on January 15th. Reference, I haven't been paid for hours' work. Okay, I need a break from my… okay, so it wouldn't be that one. It'll be this new question. Education, I haven't been paid for hours work through the work-study program, reviewed conversation. So that's the one I would… I would reference. I'm assuming that would be my reference number, which, of course, I didn't write it down, but… That would be the reference number that would let me know that I'm in the right section. That lets me know that that's the issue that I had that was submitted on October the 20th. Updated on January 30th, 2024. Okay.

Researcher: What attributes of your previous question are you looking for here?

P10: I'm looking for my question that I wrote in there. You know, what my question was, and what my… what I wrote specifically to my issues. Which is what I haven't been paid. by the work-study, through the VA work-study Program. So that was my question. So that's what I'll be looking for. I'll be looking for the date I've submitted it. And then I'll be looking for my reference number. For me, the first thing I would look for is my reference number, just so I can make sure I got the right blog. And then once I find my reference number, then I would go through it and read through everything and see what… see what the status is. And it's…

Researcher: What information here is most important to you?

P10: reference number first. And…

Researcher: And is there any other information that you would want to see here that would be helpful?

P10: Yeah, the date I submitted, it makes sure that's the right date that I submitted the, my question. And then I can see the progress. If it's… if it's not updated, I mean, if it's not resolved or answered, then I can see last updated by… whatever team that's addressing this, I can see what the status of it is by the last updated. So if I… if I submitted it, which this makes no sense, if I submitted it on the 20th… on October the 20th. And it was updated on January 3rd of 2024, which, you know, that can't be right. So, I don't know. I mean, I don't know what to tell you on that.

Researcher: And what order are you seeing the questions here?

P10: new, in progress, solve, or reopen. So I'm seeing a new… I'm seeing the new ones, I'm seeing the one that's in progress, and I'm seeing the ones that were solved, and then I'm seeing something that was… question that was reopened. I'm assuming the reopen question would be something I resubmitted because I didn't get an answer within 7 days.

Researcher: And what order would you want to see these questions shown in?

P10: I would want to see in progress first. Yeah, I wanna see… I want to see in progress first, I want to see Saab. And then I won't want to see, reopen, and then I would want to see new.

Researcher: Okay. So, as you've kind of looked into a previous question here, is there anything in particular that you liked about trying to find a new question, or find a previous question?

P10: I don't like this. The way this is set up makes… it's confusing. I don't get it. This is confusing to me.

Researcher: Yeah, can you expand a little bit more on what, what in particular is confusing?

P10: Because while… I mean, you got the new question first, so… I wouldn't be looking for the new question first, I'd be looking for the question I submitted before that's in progress, the one that I'm trying to get an answer to first. Since if I didn't get an answer, it would be in progress, so that should be first. And then… if I had a question that… was… new, then it would be after in progress. The reopen question… I don't quite get what that means. I mean, I know what it means, but I don't… I don't really know what the purpose of that is. And then, yeah, solved is fine. I mean, you could have solved questions on here, just as a reference from… For, for note, you know, just for, personal information. That's okay. So, new and reopened. Why would it be reopened? It should be new. I don't know what the reopen kind of means, really.

Researcher: Yeah, what would you… what do you expect that to mean?

P10: what I would… I would reopen would be that the question that I didn't get resolved I had to resubmit it. And it had to, I guess, had to reopen. Again, I don't quite understand the purpose of that. Okay. Who… who reopened it?

Researcher: Yeah, how would you think that that might work, like, just using that terminology alone?

P10: That would be that… The VA closed it, and realized they did not complete it, and then they reopened it. That would be my assumption.

Researcher: M? Excuse me, sorry, I've got a little tickle in my throat. Okay, well, that was helpful to kind of understand what about this was confusing for you. Is there anything else that you would like to see here in reviewing a previous question?

P10: No, other than what I just addressed, that's it.

Researcher: Okay. So, at this time, we're actually going to go through and complete really similar tasks in a slightly different system. Some things may be similar, while other things are very different, and we really want to understand which experience you prefer. So, I am going to be going back into the Zoom link, where you should be able to click on a third link, and that will bring up in your browser again. So, if you can get back to the Zoom window. Let's see… Okay, yeah, you got it. Alright, so again, you're logged into your VA account, and just as we did before, I want to imagine that you're having issues with your work-study benefits. You've been directed to ask VA to get help with these issues. Show us how you would use Ask VA to get the help you need.

P10: Okay, again, I would, just start reading the information, get answers to your questions. Should receive reply within 7 business days. Some of the information is pre-filled based off your profile. And then you can come back and finish later if you needed to, then I would click on Ask a New Question. Alright, I will verify my personal information is accurate, you know, name, last four, birthdate. And then I would continue, But if I needed to make changes, just so you know, I would… I would check… I would see the note and say, okay. something isn't correct in that information, I had to call the number there between 8 and 8 and 9 p.m. to get it to correct it, if that was an issue. But if not, I would continue. Then they would say, what is your question? I would type in my question, which is… I have not been paid for my VA benefits. I need assistance with getting My payment. That's what I would type in my question. I guess, do I have to tell you something? Okay, here we go. Haven't been paid, yeah, same thing. Can I get status on when I might receive them? Perfect. I like that. Then I would continue. And we'll click on select a category that describes your… your issue, and… We're back to the same situation, but somehow it got to work-steady before a work-steady. Just… Not seeing it here. So, since I'm not seeing… Anything dealing with worksteadies, I would look for CBCC, make sure I'm not missing anything. Oh, first, Lord have mercy. First one, education and work-study. Same thing. I thought it was something different, my bad. Then I would click continue. We'll look at the topics. Again, I would go through works… click on work study, And continue. I would check to make sure my category topic is correct. Yes. Then I would click on the sub topic, which would be… None of these, so I would click on General Question again, so I could type it in. I will click continue. Wow. Says your attachment, you can… I can attach something, a form, if I need to.

Researcher: I can upload a document, if I had a document to upload.

P10: If I don't, I'm gonna continue.

Researcher: And on the attachments there. Oops, sorry, I think it went back. I did have one question on the if you go forward one, on the attachments. I'm curious, like, in filling out a question that you might have here, Like, how often would you be including an attachment, do you think?

P10: It… I would say not often. Probably not often, yeah. I wouldn't think it would be too often I would have an attachment.

Researcher: Okay. And I think the way to get through this, if you would click into, as if you were going to add an attachment.

P10: Okay.

Researcher: Yeah, that'll get us through.

P10: Okay. And then it says, what is your relationship? Same thing, I'm a veteran. Continue… Same situation with the school. Drop-down menu, hopefully, will let me know which… let me pick where the school is located, where I'm located. And then I would click on Continue. I will make sure my contact information is accurate. Preferred name, if I had one, then I click continue. And then it talks about you're only able to edit Some, someone answers on this page. And then you may return to an earlier page in the form to edit some answers. So if I had… I knew I had issues or questions or… something I needed to correct, it lets me know I can go back if I needed to. So now I'm just verifying that my question is accurate. categories are accurate, my relationship, everything on this page is correct. If it's not correct, I can click on edit. And make the necessary changes. Once everything is correct, I submit my question. And… see what happens… Okay, there we go. It's a little slow. Alright, it says my questions are, is submitted. Successfully, I got my reference number. And… again, wait 7 days to get a response.

Researcher: So, on a scale from 1 to 5, how easy or difficult was it to complete this task? 1 being very difficult, and 5 being very easy?

P10: Bye.

Researcher: Okay. And on a scale from 1 to 5, how satisfied were you with this process? 1 being very unsatisfied, and 5 being very satisfied.

P10: Five.

Researcher: Can you expand a little bit more on… Giving, this version. Fives for both.

P10: Well, this time, I didn't have a problem with the page. moving around with my cursor, so I could… I could select the, the topic I needed easier, so that was the main thing, and I was familiar with… the page since I went through it before, so it was a little easier to navigate because I was… my familiarity Familiarity with the previous walkthrough, so that made it easier, and it was straightforward, to the point.

Researcher: And was there anything in particular about this version that you especially liked?

P10: No, I mean, it was… it was good. No, nothing specific, no.

Researcher: Was there anything in particular that you didn't like about this version?

P10: No.

Researcher: Okay. At this point, I'm going to move us into our fourth and final task, so I am going to put our last link into the Zoom chat, so if you're able to navigate back out to that… Okay, and as that loads, again, I want you to imagine that you've already logged into your VA account, and it's been maybe a month or so since you submitted that question about your work-study benefits. Show us how you would go and check on that question.

P10: Okay, first of all, it says, get answers to your questions. And then, about VA benefits and services, and you can upload any additional documents. It's supposed to be 7 days. Of course, I'm not asking a new question, I'm getting her status. Oh, my question, so… now… I mean, if I needed… if I had a lot, I could filter them, but I wouldn't think I would need to do that. But, so now I can look at a category.

Researcher: When you, when you talk about filtering, though, how might you want to filter?

P10: I could search by my topic, like, if I had… if I saw a lot, I could search by education benefits, or work-study benefits. That's… that's probably… That's probably all I would search for, personally, because I don't want to… I don't want to eliminate something that I might need to see, so I would just search on my topic. For me, that's how I would do it. And then, I would go down and look for the category, so if I searched on education. That, of course, that would be the first one. It would show the date I submitted it. Then it shows my question, it shows status as new, Last updated. January 2024, then I can click on View Details. Okay, so… I'll continue to do that. Question details, of course, it has my reference number and my status, it's new. It shows a summary of my question. And it has some attachments, so… I would click on the attachments to see what they are, since I didn't load them. And then, once I find out what those attachments are, then I can go to response from the VA. So, let me see… response from the VA, September. I'll look at the dates. Find a date that corresponds to… you know, the date that I had on. the previous page. And I would… I would expand it. And the one that I… the one that is expanded would be the response from the VA. I would read what their response is. And I would say, looked at your records, found an option that might be better for one sent over previously. I'm happy to jump on a call to discuss and make it a… an appointment. Oh, we can make an appointment, okay. then I would send my reply. Whatever that means, so… based off their response, I don't know what it would be, but whatever their response would be, I would send a reply. or I would schedule a call. And then if I had a document that I needed to upload, I would upload the document. And then I would send… Send all that information back to the VA rep.

Researcher: Okay. If you go back one page, I had a couple more questions for you, in reviewing your questions, and I'll actually have you use the back button in the browser to go back.

P10: Okay? There, I'm there.

Researcher: So, as you're looking at things here, what information is most important from what you see here?

P10: The categories, you know, the whole layout of this, as far as… I like the way it's laid out, as far as the category would be. For me, it would be education. So, it lays them out in order. So, if I had more than one… I could look at them and just follow through on it, and then get the details on the far right. It lets you know the status straight up front. So I can know what's going on. Of course, it has my question. So I like the way it's laid out.

Researcher: And is there anything else here that would be helpful to finding a previous question?

P10: Nope.

Researcher: And what order are you seeing your questions in here?

P10: Well, for me, the first one would be the education. It's the one I'm seeing. I mean, you said questions, but I only had one question, so the first one would be my question, education. The other question would be… For whatever they are.

Researcher: Yeah, so imagine these are all questions that you've asked in the past. How are you seeing the order of all of these questions?

P10: Okay, I would, of course, look at… for me, I would look at the date I submitted them. Let's see, 25, 24, 23, September… yeah, it's in this chronological order, if that's right, we're, So it's in the order of the… Most recent to the least. by the date submitted. So, it allows me to go to the one that I feel that I need to check first, based off the date submitted.

Researcher: Is there any other order that you would want to see these in?

P10: I mean, I could see it going the other way, but I can go either way. I mean, I'm sure some may say it's better to have the older questions first, and work down to the newer questions. Yeah, I can see it going that way. Maybe a little easier to follow, since you want to address the older questions before you get to the new questions first, so… I would say switch it around, have the oldest The oldest questions at the top, and then work down to the newest ones at the bottom.

Researcher: Okay. And would you use any of the other, like, fields that you see here, any of the other information on this table that you might order your questions by?

P10: Yeah, I would make sure that, my status… that's the key one for me. What's the status? That's what I need to know. They can load their stuff in the car.

Researcher: Yeah, we're just… we're just about to wrap up, so I know you have to go. So I will… that was… that was the last question and the last task that I had for you. I've got a couple just kind of follow-up questions here, that I… and I'm actually going to take on the screen share from you.

P10: Okay.

Researcher: So, you should be able to see my screen, is that correct?

P10: Yes.

Researcher: Okay. So, you got to experience two different versions of AskVA today, and so on the left was kind of the first experience you went through in order to submit a question, and the image on the right is the second version that you experienced today. So, if you look at these two versions and think about your experiences with them, which one did you prefer?

P10: Oh, easy, the one on the right.

Researcher: Okay. And can you expand on that at all, as to why?

P10: Well, for one, it's less… less screens you gotta go through. it's a little bit more straightforward. You know, I can put everything on the first screen here. On the one on the right. The one on the left, you got to go through the first screen, then you get to the second screen, then go from there. So I like that. I… I don't have to have to go… I don't have to go through so many screens to get to the end.

Researcher: Hmm. And when you say the end, you mean your question, is that correct?

P10: Yes, correct.

Researcher: Okay. And then one more question here. So, we also went in and reviewed previous questions, and so the one on the left is the first experience you had, and then the one on the right is the one we were just looking at. So if you had to choose between those two, which one did you prefer?

P10: The one on the right.

Researcher: So, that's this one over here. Or no.

P10: Yes, the one that… Yes, yes, that one. The one on my right, yeah.

Researcher: Yeah, sorry. This table form, is that correct?

P10: Yes, table form is a lot better.

Researcher: Okay, and can you talk a little bit more about just kind of why you chose that one?

P10: But, I mean, visually, it's easier to see and understand. It lays it out. Clearer where you can… you can follow them. I can… I can follow it easier because of the way it's laid out. I can see… The categories by… you know, everything is laid out. In an orderly fashion categories. Submitted date, question, status. you know, updates and details. Instead of trying to go through one block versus another block. Trying to figure out what's going on there, so I can see everything. It's a little bit more easier on the eyes and easier to understand.

Researcher: Okay. Great. Well, thank you for… providing all the feedback and spending the last hour with us. Just one last thing to kind of close this out. I wanted to circle back and reconfirm whether or not you were comfortable if we were to share any video clips of this session with our VA partners, and we would be removing all identifiable information and just sharing, like, brief clips. Okay, amazing. Thank you for allowing us to… to do that. We really appreciate you taking the last hour with us. Really appreciate all your thoughts and your feedback on these experiences. They really help us to improve the experiences for veterans like yourself. So, just to… I guess we've got one more minute. I wanted to open it back up to you to see if you had any questions for me before we close out.

P10: No, I don't have any questions. I appreciate this. I mean, I enjoy doing these because it does… I see it does help, and I've seen some things that have changed over the past, so I… I appreciate what you guys do, because, you know, it can be… taxing and confusing, and it's good to know that you talk to veterans to try to make sure it's a little bit more easier to understand. I appreciate that.

Researcher: Yeah, well, I know Perigian will also be sending kind of a little thank you note to you after the session's been completed. They add a little blurb in there if you would feel comfortable sharing that with other veterans. They're continually adding people to their recruitment pool to just, like, help us continue doing research like this. It's really helpful to be able to speak directly to veterans who are using these services and these digital experiences. So feel free to share that with other veterans that, you know, that might be interested in participating.

P10: Will do.

Researcher: Awesome. Have a great day, Benny.

P10: Alright, bye-bye.

Researcher: Bye.
