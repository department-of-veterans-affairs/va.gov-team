Researcher: OK, once that now that that's started, can you go ahead and just confirm one more time that you're comfortable with us recording today?

P16: I am comfortable with the recording.

Researcher: OK, awesome. Thank you. So as I mentioned, I would love for you to just kind of reiterate some of what you talked about in your earlier intro. Exactly what you said we were interested in a little bit more about your school and kind of like how many students you're serving, what your. Current role is there and maybe your years of experience in doing this work.

P16: OK, so my name is <REDACTED - P16's name>. I am the manager of veteran services for Lone Star College system. So in addition to, of course, managing the VA work study my area. We process federal GI Bill benefits as well. Currently we have, I think about around 90, 000 students system wide. Of those 90, 000 we have over 3000 military affiliated students that are utilizing federal GI Bill benefits. And I think we have about 8 campuses, multiple centers. So we're a large institution. We have about 26 current VA work study students for fall 2025 and I have managed

Researcher: Yeah.

P16: the program. Since March of 2015. So right, you know, at a little bit over 10 years.

Researcher: OK, great. So as a work study site Supervisor, I was hoping you could just kind of describe your role a little bit more for me.

P16: OK, so my role and and to give a little bit of background to this. So Lone Star College because we are such a large system. We process the benefits and oversee the VA work study program at the system level. So although these these students may be stationed at individual campuses, I as the work site supervisor, do the you know the application process, the contracts, the time cards. But they report to our VA representative at that campus. So it's all kind of a dotted line structure.

Researcher: Hmm. Mention.

P16: So that's kind of how we were set up. So any and all things work. Study, you know, required by the VA work study program submissions requests. They're done by me.

Researcher: OK. And you said there's 26 work study students this semester. Is that like an average of about how many y'all would have each semester?

P16: That is the highest it's been since COVID. I would say we took a hit. So prior to COVID, I would say about 2526 was about our average numbers dipped and for the first time since about 2020. This Is Us back at that, that average of about 2526 VA work study students.

Researcher: OK. And maybe at a high level, could you kind of walk me through you've you've talked about some of the different pieces, but could you walk me through what the overall process is with a work study student from from your perspective specifically kind of pointing out some of? The engagement that you would have with VA in that process.

P16: So generally, however, this comes about, you know, a work study applicant is selected for hire and I guess my question is, do I do we need to? Do I need to explain processes that are not a part of like VA requirements? Because we have some internal processes that that OK. So what I'll do is I'll just limit it to what the VA requires.

Researcher: I think. Yeah, that's that's what I was gonna say is, like, maybe kind of at a high level and and

P16: Mm-hmm.

Researcher: focusing on some of the engagement with uh with EA, yeah.

P16: OK. So of course, before I submit an actual work study application to the Department of Veteran Affairs, I check the eligibility requirements. Are they certified three quarter time you know, is that information inputed into the VA system once that's complete? Once I verify that they actually are eligible, from my perspective, I submit the application through ask VA. I also keep paper backup files as well as electronic records of the submissions, and I wait on the processing once I receive the actual contract time card in the letter letting me know that the student is eligible, then that information is forwarded to the student for their sign. Once they sign because they have to have a signed contract in place before they can begin working. So once I have that signed contract in place,

Researcher: OK.

P16: I submit that to the VA work study program via ask VA in the work study is free to begin working. So that's the onboarding process for us.

Researcher: OK. And then I guess what's kind of part of the like ongoing need?

P16: For after the work studies, they're actually OK. So once they have their signed contract on on file then they can begin working from there. The only real the only documentation aspect of the program that's required by the VA is timecard submission. So the VA requires if the students working a regular standard contract that time cards are submitted, you know, as a reflection of the hours they work either every 50 hours. Or every two weeks, whichever comes first, I believe, and I hope I'm not wrong,

Researcher: Hmm.

P16: that the I guess the concept behind this is they won't pay. the VA won't pay over a Max of 50 hours at one time.

Researcher: Mm-hmm.

P16: So once they hit the 50 hour mark or the two week Mark, then the time card is, you know, they keep their log on the time card every single day. They initial each date entry I initial. There's a signature line for the worksite supervisor at the bottom. Scan it, upload it and submit it via ask VA.

Researcher: OK.

P16: So also one more thing that I do is. I in ask Virginia. There is a confirmation that you receive. So there's a pop-up confirmation in addition to that, I receive a confirmation e-mail that system generated for my own documentation.

Researcher: Hmm.

P16: I typically print that confirmation. So that I'll have the confirmation number in the event that and I don't think it's called a confirmation number, I can't remember. I keep it in the event that a payment is lost or a payment is not, you know, processed and I can call. I can call the VA and reference that

Researcher: Hmm.

P16: submission number.

Researcher: OK. So maybe either by like a week or a month time frame about how frequently are you using SBA.

P16: Oh gosh. At least every other day, at least.

Researcher: Like once a day.

P16: And that is exactly because that is an internal thing with me, because I don't have like time card submissions on a say, oh, we do this, I only submit them one day a week. You know what I mean?

Researcher: Hmm.

P16: So which means that it's a rolling process for me as far as time card

Researcher: Mm-hmm.

P16: submission. So since everyone is starting and working different dates and times then. They're continuously submitting time cards to me. As they reach the 50 hour two week Mark. Now that's just the thing that I do, but because of that, it could almost be daily that I'm, you know, utilizing the system just for timecard submissions alone.

Researcher: Hmm. Once. OK. OK. Yeah, that's really helpful to understand kind of your perspective, your process kind of the context within what you're doing and how you're using SBA. I'm gonna move us into the next part of our session and I'm gonna be providing you with some different scenarios. And I'm gonna have. You start off first by sharing your screen with us, and once you do that then I can provide a link.

P16: OK. So let's say entire screen. I don't know on this. Should I share?

Researcher: Oh yeah, so if you so there should be a share button on the top where we're gonna be in a browser, so.

P16: Yes.

Researcher: If you wanna share just a browser window or you could share your whole screen,

P16: OK.

Researcher: but whatever you're most comfortable with that will be in like any browser that

P16: I'm OK.

Researcher: you're using.

P16: Let me. I'll just share this particular tab.

Researcher: OK. Well, and I think we might need more than a tab because I'm gonna send you some new links to click into.

P16: OK.

Researcher: And so if you could share, maybe just like if you bring that tab into it like its own browser window, that might work better.

P16: OK. Let's see.

Researcher: But we'll have several links that we're going through in this session. So just maybe to make it a little bit easier for each time we click on one.

P16: I don't know if this is gonna work.

Researcher: Oh I can.

P16: What do you?

Researcher: I can see myself in this one.

P16: OK. It may be easier for me if can I get the link and click on it, then share the screen OK. That's that's kind of what I'm accustomed to.

Researcher: Sorry. Yeah, yeah. So I just shared the link with you and like I said, we will have multiple links. So if you end up needing to like reshare or something, yeah.

P16: OK. I'm waiting on the link to come up and then I will share my screen.

Researcher: It should be in the teams chat.

P16: I got it.

Researcher: OK, perfect. Oh, you're. Yeah, waiting for it to load or something. OK,

P16: Yes.

Researcher: perfect.

P16: OK. I think this is it.

Researcher: OK, perfect.

P16: OK.

Researcher: OK. So imagine you're here to submit documentation on behalf of a student. You've been directed to submit the documentation through askva before you click on anything to complete this task, take a second to look around and talk about what it is that you're seeing here. This is kinda gets us warmed up with talking out loud.

P16: OK. I see the standard ask VA. You know the initial screen. It it is a little to me. It's not always user-friendly. I was showing someone this, actually a colleague Valer yesterday because she doesn't log in as often and and she had difficulty figuring out like, OK, where do I start? So you know it's there's a little bit of, I don't know how to describe it.

Researcher: Hmm.

P16: There's it's a little wordy. But you know, but it it looks like the standard screen that I see and use every day, you know, with the option to begin my question.

Researcher: And for you in particular, how do you normally get here?

P16: I have the. I have the page saved as a favorite in my browser.

Researcher: OK. OK. So now go ahead and show us how you would use askva to submit your documentation.

P16: The first step is to click on the ask a new question button. Of course, the information pops up and I can't remember off the top of my head, but at some point of course I have to submit my login information. And when I click the the login tab or the the button for my that has my e-mail in

Researcher: Hmm.

P16: and password, I will receive a text message with a verification code. Have to pause. Make sure I get the message and then enter the code before I get to the actual screens to ask my question. So that's the only part that, of course is missing here. Next, when I get to the category section, I will select education benefits and work study. Then I'll select continue from here. I will scroll to the bottom. Click on work study because I'm only of course submitting work study items.

Researcher: And I think can I have you go back just one screen there?

P16: The next. Yes.

Researcher: Yeah, so here. Maybe you might go back in the browser bar, OK? Yeah. From there, maybe that. Would allow us to move forward. I'm curious like from the category and yeah, if you go forward one more, what these lists mean to you?

P16: What these? So I am aware that ask V as a system that's utilized by veterans and dependents and spouses. So I don't really pay attention to much of this, but I do know that these options are topics are for people that are utilizing the system for other reasons. So I really don't pay much attention.

Researcher: OK.

P16: I really just kind of come in scroll to work study which is the area that I. You know submitting a a question for.

Researcher: And what would you do if you couldn't find an option that fit your needs here?

P16: I would probably select the option that is closest to my need. I think I would question, you know, like, OK, am I in the right place? But if I know that OK, this is the system I'm supposed to be

Researcher: Hmm.

P16: using, I I don't know. I would do one of two things. Select the one that is is the closest to the fit you know of what I'm trying to submit, or I may even pause and call the work study align to make sure that there hasn't been a change that I'm unaware of. Of.

Researcher: OK. And how important do you think these this question in the in the previous list, how important are these lists?

P16: How important are the lists?

Researcher: Mm-hmm.

P16: I they're not OK. The list are. I mean, overall they're not. I I guess the issue for me is is that list is so long and I wish that I didn't

Researcher: Hmm.

P16: have to see all of this other you know, all the other information that is not that's not relevant to me other than that. I mean it's really just ins.

Researcher: Hmm.

P16: To me, other than the one option that I'm here to select.

Researcher: OK. OK. Thanks for letting me go a little bit deeper in your in your thought process here. So go ahead and continue as as you would.

P16: OK, so work study continue. What is your relationship to the veteran? Of course, my relationship to the veteran in this situation is or the dependent for that matter, is I'm connected to the veteran through my work, for example, as a school certifying officiary or fiduciary. So I will click continue, select that option and click continue.

Researcher: And one quick question I had, I don't think I asked this at the very

P16: Mm-hmm.

Researcher: beginning, but I wanted to maybe clarify are are you yourself a veteran at all in this instance either?

P16: I am not.

Researcher: You are not OK. Just wanted to like understand some of the different perspectives there, OK.

P16: No, it's OK. And what is your role? And I am for this purpose of this submission. I am a work study site supervisor.

Researcher: And when you say it like that, are there other roles that you might?

P16: Yes, yes. So in addition to the worksite supervisor

Researcher: Play in this, OK? Can you talk a little bit about that?

P16: study site supervisor, I'm also a school certifying official.

Researcher: OK. Can you talk a little bit more about kind of the the dual roles?

P16: Umm. Well, so I am the manager of essentially all of the school certifying so officials for our system. So that's just, that's actually my primary role is managing school certifying officials. So of course that requires that I am also a designated school certifying official

Researcher: OK.

P16: as well. So of course, the certifying officials responsible for

Researcher: Have fun.

P16: in short, submitting enrollment information to the Department of Veteran Affairs for students that are using federal benefit. So there could be a time where I would need to use this exact same system under the umbrella of a school certifying official. But for this purpose I am using it under the umbrella of a work study site supervisor.

Researcher: OK. And I guess we we talked a lot about the context earlier about like using it maybe once a day as a work study site supervisor in your other role as a school certifying official like how often would

P16: Mm-hmm.

Researcher: you be using it for that context?

P16: I actually don't use it that often. I can actually remember the last time I did because. We typically call the VA if there is a question that we have. So personally I do not use ask VA that often because I can get a faster response

Researcher: Hmm.

P16: by calling.

Researcher: OK. OK. Thanks for clarifying that. That's really helpful to understand kind of the differences in the roles and stuff.

P16: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

Researcher: OK.

P16: OK. So I've selected my role as work study site supervisor continue and then I have to select. I'm sorry, the state. I don't know what's happening here. Oops. Let me go back. So for whatever reason, I can't. So it's it's just like prompting. It's it's only allowing California to pop up. So it for the sake of, I guess the demonstration, can I just continue? I'm not able. It's not giving me the full drop down of all U.S. states.

Researcher: Yeah. Is that what you would expect there?

P16: No. So what typically happens is when I the the box is blank and then once I select the box I get a complete list of all states in the US and then I Scroll down to Texas because that's where I'm located and I would select Texas.

Researcher: OK.

P16: I'm sorry, any time I do this is just kinda so I'm just gonna continue. And then this screen is just and normally this screen is pre filled. There are times for whatever random reason that I may log in one day and it is not pre filled. So I'll have to, you know, enter that information in, but the of course my contact information was something that was entered at the time I created my account. So of course it normally has my phone number. So the phone number attached to this account is my work phone number, my office number, and then my work e-mail address as well. I do not have a preferred name listed. For my account.

Researcher: OK.

P16: So continue. And then review and submit now. One thing that, of course is missing is there's a step in between before I get to this screen where it is. A section to where I can actually upload the document that I am submitting, and there's also it's almost kind of like an e-mail structure, but there's a title where I normally put works WS Dash. The type of document that I'm selecting, which that reminds me there was a screen missing. So prior to this there's a screen that will ask you what type of document you're submitting. After you know after you've made the selection that you're submitting a work study item. So typically there's a screen that will ask you. What type of document or what? I'm sorry will allow you to select the type of work study Doc. Document that you're asking a question about, and so I just noticed that's missing. Once you select that document,

Researcher: OK.

P16: then you get to the screen where you can actually upload the document and include a narrative. So normally in the title I put WS for

Researcher: Hmm.

P16: work, study Dash and then. I enter the type of document, whether it's a time card application signed contract. In the narrative box or the notes box, I just say hello. So I've attached a time card for such and such. Thank you. And then I upload the item, click submit. And that takes us to this screen where we can finally submit the item.

Researcher: OK. Yeah, that's really helpful to kind of hear kind of what you would be, what you would be doing in some of these fields? I think we might. We might be able to. Quickly refresh your your screen. I think we might be able to go back 'cause you said you were missing some screens. I think we.

P16: Yes.

Researcher: Yeah, we might be able to. Fix that. So if you can refresh that browser. And then I think trying to think of the best way, yeah,

P16: I guess I'd have to go back.

Researcher: or you could potentially reopen the link that I shared and we can kinda try to

P16: OK.

Researcher: quickly walk through it again to to make sure the screens that you're expecting to see would be there or not.

P16: Are you able to see the the screen the same one from before?

Researcher: No, it looks like the the share stopped.

P16: OK. OK, let me fix that. OK. Do you see it now?

Researcher: I can see it now.

P16: Perfect. OK. So we'll go back through, ask a question and then of course my personal information, which is my name, last four of my social date of birth would normally be here. Continue then I select the category that I'm submitting a question under which is education benefits and work study. Continue. Then from this list I will select this, specifically the work study program. Continue. My relationship to the veteran I am selecting, I'm connected to the veteran through my work. Questions about VA benefits and services. I am my role in this instances work study site supervisor. The state facility is, of course it's only allowing me to select California. Typically, I would select Texas and continue. It just went back OK. Let's do this again. Let me try to refresh. I don't know what's happening.

Researcher: Yeah, we might be having a little bit of an issue with the with this prototype. So I think. I think for the sake of time, I think I am gonna go ahead and and move us on to a couple of questions I had for you.

P16: OK.

Researcher: So you kind of you walked through this flow and and got to the end of it on a scale from 1:00 to 5:00. How easy or difficult was it to complete that task? One, sorry one. Being very difficult and five being very easy.

P16: 5.

Researcher: And on a scale from 1:00 to 5:00, how satisfied were you with this process? One being very unsatisfied and five being very satisfied?

P16: From the perspective of using the prototype or just in general, when I submit via ask VA.

Researcher: I'm gonna say maybe a little bit of both. I know we had some some issues with the prototype,

P16: Yeah.

Researcher: but maybe you can speak to those a little bit more. So let's maybe focus on the experience you just had.

P16: Oh, I mean it was. It's a 5. It's not. I mean or four it. I mean the the issue is minor so.

Researcher: OK. And how do you feel overall about the length of the form that you completed?

P16: I feel like it's it's it's. It mirrors the process almost, but of course not identically because it didn't include everything. I mean, there were some some items or some screens missing. But overall, it's pretty close to what I would normally the process that I normally follow.

Researcher: OK. And at this point, after you've submitted something, what would you do next after submitting?

P16: So I make sure that I get the the pop-up screen that lets me know that that the submission went through, and then I wait. Make sure I get the the e-mail confirmation, print that for my records and then you know at this point I'm, you know depends on. What I'm submitting, but if it's a time card, I know it's done. And now we're just waiting on payment. If it's an application that I know that I'm waiting on a contract from the VA. Or you know. Know something like that. So it's it's, you know, either I'm closing it out an item that is submitted or I am waiting on you know something that I need to receive back based on the question I submitted.

Researcher: And what would you expect to ask Virginia to do next after you've submitted?

P16: I just expect the confirmation from the system itself, just the confirmation. And a follow up, once the item is completed.

Researcher: OK. And what might prompt you to return to ask VA related to a previous submission? So kind of what what might bring you back into the system to look at the submission?

P16: So. OK. If I notice that there has a significant amount of time has passed and I have not either a received a confirmation or BI haven't received the item, you know. So normally if something takes the VA 5 to 10 days and I'm on day 11, then I'm going to. Log in and and check as VA. This may be more information than you're asking. One of the biggest issues that I have is. The automatic response. That come that are system generated. Send me an e-mail but the only way for me to see what that says is if I go log back in to read it and that's very difficult to do with the number of work studies I have because it could just be.

Researcher: Hmm.

P16: A basic word processing or reviewing versus oh, there's a problem so.

Researcher: Hmm.

P16: But that's just kind of that part of the system.

Researcher: Hmm. Gotcha. So it sounds like you would maybe want to see the actual responses in your e-mail. Is that kind of what you're looking for? OK, OK.

P16: Absolutely, absolutely.

Researcher: Yeah, that's that's helpful to to understand kind of your expectation there.

P16: Mm-hmm.

Researcher: So I'm going to be providing a second link for us to dive into. So let me put that in the chat here and we'll move on to our second task.

P16: OK. Hmm.

Researcher: And I, yeah, I was gonna say I can't see your screen yet. OK, perfect. So again, imagine that similar to what we were just talking about, it's maybe been a couple of weeks since you submitted this and you wanted to review your previous submission. Show us how you would check on that using SVA.

P16: So first of all, I make sure so the two tabs at the bottom there's a business and a personal. So of course this section shows you every question you submitted and so and I do believe it, it goes back from however long you've been in the system. But I make sure that business is selected. There was a time when this was launched. Early on that I don't think there was a business tab. So there are some things for me under personal, but they have nothing to do with my personal life.

Researcher: Hmm.

P16: It's just it was. That's how the submissions were done at the time. So I make sure that the business tab is selected.

Researcher: Hmm.

P16: Now I don't know if this is just something I don't know or this is just how it is. I have to scroll through normally because I have multiple submissions. There are pages at the bottom you know, and I have to scroll through to find the person or the inquiry that I'm looking for. And and it it could be. Maybe I haven't played enough with the filter. Or something like that. Probably so, but normally I have to kind of scroll and flip through it to find whatever the submission is that I'm looking for.

Researcher: So what kinds of pieces of information are you using to look for your submission? Like what attributes of the question you asked? Are you looking for?

P16: I'm looking at the submission date. Sometimes I'm looking at the reference number, but also. So this is also why I keep a print out of the the submission the confirmation, right? Because all of that would be the information that I printed out from the submission would also appear here. So I can easily identify the date that I submitted the item and then come back here and look for items submitted on that day. 8 to narrow down my search and then also I have the reference number because that

Researcher: Hmm.

P16: is that's on the confirmation or included in the confirmation e-mail as well. Lastly, the narrative here where it says I need to submit, you know, forms for student of this John Smith. I also will put the person's name, so that's the third area that helps me narrow down what I'm looking for.

Researcher: OK. And what is the most important piece of information here to you?

P16: Probably the date, the submission date or submitted date, because that that gets me to where I need to be, followed by the name.

Researcher: OK. And is there any other information that would be helpful for you to see here?

P16: Maybe. I don't know if I have an answer for that one. And and the reason why. I don't know if I have an answer is because I don't think I've done my due diligence to see if there are better ways to search through this as opposed to flipping through screens, but. I don't know. Maybe keeping the submissions in date order? Possibly so that because what happens is is that when you navigate to this screen. It begins to move based on the action like the last updated date, so you know it's no longer just in the order of the the date order of which you ask the question. It's shifting around based off of when the the question was last updated as well.

Researcher: So what order would you want to see these in?

P16: I think the easiest thing for me would be the submitted date. You know, because that's something I can always reference and I can understand is that I can always quickly identify how to find

Researcher: Hmm.

P16: this based on the date that I submitted.

Researcher: OK. And I'm curious like from your own process you I know you said you're like printing these off. Is that something that like you're filing and like kind of going back to regularly

P16: Yes.

Researcher: to like go look at that piece of paper? Is that I'm just kind of curious like your own personal process there.

P16: Yes, and I don't. You know, there's probably a better way to do it, but I use paper for now. The easiest thing for me, but yeah, so each one of my work studies has an individual folder, so the left side are the IT starts with application their signed contract and then every new semester it builds until I have the most recent items on the left side on. The right side. I put the the time card submission. So for example, anytime I submit a timecard, I take cause.

Researcher: Hmm.

P16: Of course the time cards are paper.

Researcher: Hmm.

P16: I take the time card I want to submit it and then once I get the e-mail confirmation, I put it on top so I know that that confirmation corresponds with that time card submission and I just build on top in the most recent always goes on top.

Researcher: OK, OK, cool. Thanks for kind of walking me through like that,

P16: Mm-.

Researcher: that in person process that's not necessarily digital.

P16: OK, OK.

Researcher: It's good to understand kind of how that's working for you. OK. Is there anything else in particular here that you really liked or didn't like about reviewing a previous submission?

P16: No, I just. This is not really gonna be helpful. It's it's just not user-friendly. It's not easy on the eye. I just wish that there was an easier way to. I don't know if maybe like even tabs like resolved in progress new like something that is not just a series of submissions with various. Statuses I guess? But. You know, I I think a lot of my issues kind of live outside of this and how the communications come through.

Researcher: And that was what you were saying earlier about, like the responses in e-mail and such. OK. OK.

P16: Exactly.

Researcher: So I'm gonna move us on to our next task and we're actually going to be doing the same tasks in a slightly different system. So some things may be similar, while others may be different.

P16: OK.

Researcher: So we want to understand overall what your preference is between them. So I'm going to be putting a third link into our chat. And I'll have you. Open that link and share your screen again.

P16: Hey.

Researcher: OK. So again, just as we did before, I want you to imagine that you're submitting documentation on behalf of a student. In this case, I am going to prompt you to maybe kind of think about it from the SCO role. And show us how you would use ask VA to submit documentation here.

P16: OK. I would of course start with ask a new question. Continue past verifying my personal information.

Researcher: So you can't necessarily type in here, but I would love to think.

P16: Mm-hmm.

Researcher: Have you think through what you might want to put here?

P16: So. I can't say that. OK, well, it it could be a situation. So from the SEO perspective, normally it could be a question about. A payment, right? And we submitted so maybe I upload a copy of an enrollment that we submitted and I asked the question of we submitted this students enrollment and tuition and fee cost On this date. We have yet to receive the payment. Can someone research the matter? Something like that. That could be a question that we would ask from the SCO perspective.

Researcher: Hmm. OK.

P16: So of course, you know, if there was an option to upload, you know, upload the document and enter the question and click continue. Category would be. Now give me a second on this one. So I I haven't. The the options here I don't really see anything that would align with the scenario that I just gave.

Researcher: So what would you do if you didn't see an option that fits your scenario?

P16: In this instance, since there is nothing. I'm I'm looking through carefully since there's nothing remotely close to what I stated I would call.

Researcher: OK. And what would you be looking for in this

P16: Now this could be an issue. I'm sorry.

Researcher: field based on that scenario?

P16: I would probably be looking in again. I don't do that part very often as far as submitting a question, but I would be looking for payment issue missing payment. Something like that I would assume or or let me back up. Of course, they would need to know the benefit. So if if it's tuition fees, more than likely I'm asking based on a chapter 33 or post 911 student selecting the benefit and then of course a category associated with the issue. So tuition and fee or tuition and fee payment or something like that.

Researcher: OK, OK. So you said at this point you would probably call if you don't see something that that fit your scenario?

P16: Yes.

Researcher: OK. I think to to try and continue us on this path, I will help a little bit here and have you click on that first one. That's education benefits and work study.

P16: And I was there the whole time. Now that you say that, and I'm so used to disregarding the first half of the statement and only paying attention to work study. So that makes all the sense in the world to click on education benefits. Thank you.

Researcher: OK.

P16: There we go. So it's crazy how I get accustomed to doing something like a robot, and I don't even think about the other parts.

Researcher: Hmm.

P16: So here I would of course select post 911.

Researcher: OK.

P16: It's not letting me select anything. Let me try something else.

Researcher: Yeah. What did the other options mean to you here again?

P16: Oh, so of course. Exactly what I I just said. The benefits? So these are the benefits that.

Researcher: And.

P16: Primarily benefits that you know we process, but then there's other fields as well, like for example compliance surveys. So we do go through compliance surveys annually, so otherwise known as like an audit. We have the school certifying officials, so I'm gonna assume that that would be the option that we would. Select. If we hadn't a question from the perspective of school certifying official. Verifying school enrollment. Some of these fields are not things that I would need as a school certifying official so.

Researcher: Pen.

P16: But they're here, like licensing and testing fees. But you know, some of these veteran readiness and employment, I'm assuming we could ask a question about that, although typically those questions need to be asked directly to vrne as well.

Researcher: OK. Yeah. So go ahead and continue. With this process.

P16: OK. So this would be of course the area that I described earlier where if I am asking about a post 911 students like their tuition payment and I've already selected you know that particular benefit and I've selected that I'm getting other school asking a question from the PERS. Of a school certifying official. Then this is where I would upload any you know, supporting documentation that I might have. Regarding my question. In.

Researcher: OK.

P16: And then of course, continue. And our supporting documentation that was attached is here and we would select continue again and it is routing me back to well. So I guess I am now letting them know that I'm connected to the veteran through my work as the school certified official. Letting them know again, I'm a school certifying official. Enroll. And searching for my school. So of course I would search to find my particular school Lone Star College. So I will just select one of these for now. Continue. I saw the school certifying official. I'm sorry the school and facility code. And do you want this to be your saved school facility? This depends. We have multiple locations, so that part may, but we also do everything on their primary. So I probably would. Go ahead and save my school facility code. If it's not already there, I don't know. It's not letting me click. Yes, I'll just select no. And review my contact information again. Review my question attachments relationship. All of their information I've selected up to this point and now submit my question.

Researcher: So on a scale from 1:00 to 5:00, how easy. Or difficult. Was it to complete this task one? Being very difficult and five being very easy. OK. And on a scale from 1:00 to 5:00, how satisfied were you with this process, one being very unsatisfied and five being very satisfied?

P16: I'm going to say A3.

Researcher: OK. Can you expand a little bit more on that rating?

P16: I just. Yes, I think that there could be a few more. Details or options available to make it to where you you're for sure you know like I guess to make sure to confirm that you're submitting under the right topic.

Researcher: And what might that look like to you?

P16: So for example, there was we saw a screen in which I of course confirmed that I'm a school certifying official. Then there was a screen that I wanted to select. You know a post 911, but after that I want to make sure that

Researcher: Hmm.

P16: and and I guess this just requires a narrative, but it would be nice, I guess maybe on the other end, the receiving end. To understand the nature of the question whether it falls under. A debt a student debt in error and enrollment or you know, a missing payment. So to be able to select more specific options that are associated with why I'm submitting the question or the nature of the question.

Researcher: OK. Great. Thanks for providing that additional context. That's helpful. So because we we just have a couple minutes and I maybe I will ask you at

P16: Mm-hmm.

Researcher: this point, do you have maybe five extra minutes that we can we can spend a wrap up or do you have?

P16: So give me one moment.

Researcher: A.

P16: I am scheduled for an 11:00 AM meeting, but give me a second to let them know I

Researcher: OK.

P16: may be a few minutes late.

Researcher: OK. And I will try to finish this out here pretty quickly.

P16: OK.

Researcher: So yeah, once you do that, I do have another link that'll have us go

P16: OK.

Researcher: to and it'll be our our last task.

P16: OK, we can proceed.

Researcher: OK. Thank you so much for taking a few extra minutes.

P16: Oh no problem.

Researcher: I really appreciate it. You're giving us and just really valuable feedback, so I'm happy to be able to try to finish this as quickly as we can.

P16: Oh, link four. OK, got it.

Researcher: Yeah. So the last link there.

P16: OK.

Researcher: All right, so again, let's imagine that you need to come back in and review a previous submission. So go ahead and show us how you would check on that submission using SVA.

P16: So I don't. I have not submitted any questions under an SCO, so this looks like I mean in years, so this does look a little foreign to me, but of course I would. Let me see surge filter by so oh. The first thing is always making sure that the business tab is selected and. I am going to go with my same. Thought process as with on the work study side, I would probably look under the date submitted category. Now the only thing I have to say is and this is just I'm unsure I see that there's a category tab to the on the the first column so I Don. Know if I'm assuming that if I were to ask a question under the SL umbrella that it would probably show. Mixed in with my work study questions. But regardless, if I go back to the date submitted then I would be able to locate the information.

Researcher: And is there any information that you feel like is maybe missing here?

P16: No.

Researcher: OK. And what order are you seeing these questions? And then what order would you like to see them? In.

P16: As as it is, they're in order of the submission of the date that the question was submitted, and that's that's the the order that I prefer is based on the date they're submitted.

Researcher: OK.

P16: And that I do see the last updated, but I like the fact that in this screen the date submitted is is kind of one of the first things that I see if I'm reading from left to right.

Researcher: OK. Great, that's that's really helpful. So is there any other thoughts about we kind of just looked at the screen pretty quickly? Are there any other things that you like about reviewing a submission in this way?

P16: No, I mean it's it's pretty cut and dry. You know, I don't know if I can click on this, OK, but you still have to click here to see the details of it maybe. If it, you know expanded from that screen as opposed to taking you to another screen. But other than that, no.

Researcher: Hmm. OK. Anything in particular that you didn't like about reviewing submissions this way?

P16: No.

Researcher: OK. So with that, that was our last task. I'm going to actually take over the screen share myself and.

P16: OK.

Researcher: You should see my screen here in a second. Can you see my screen OK?

P16: Yes, ma'am.

Researcher: OK. So in our session today, you experienced two different versions of ask VA. We walked you through a task to submit. Some documentation. So on the left hand of the screen that was kind of our our first, the first version that you experienced and on the right was the second version you experienced. So thinking about these two experiences, which one did you prefer?

P16: Umm. OK. Just so I'm clear. OK. So I would say. Ah. I guess the one on the left.

Researcher: OK. And can you expand a little bit on that?

P16: I guess because it. I mean it it. It I guess let me go ahead and be honest about what I'm seeing on the left side. I just see how it starts and on the right hand side. It I guess it's just taking us directly to the question. So the the on the left hand side. I'm at least able to select the category that I want to start with. So I guess the one on the left, because I can make sure that I'm selecting. I mean that I'm in the right place based on the the category that I select.

Researcher: OK. And maybe can you expand a little bit on that sentiment of like feeling like you're in the right place? What does that mean to you in relation to submitting the documentation here?

P16: Because I don't want to. I wanna make sure that I'm submitting in the right place, because I mean time is of the essence. So generally at the point that I'm

Researcher: Hmm.

P16: submitting something, regardless of whether or not it's a work study item or I'm submitting from the perspective of an SCO, it time is. Of the essence, whether it's involving someone's pay or a debt or something like that. So. Anytime that something is incorrectly routed. Then that causes additional delays as well.

Researcher: Hmm. OK. OK. And just this last question here. Similarly, you saw two different experiences to review previous submission. So on the left we have the first version that you saw and on the right was the one we were just most recently looking at. Between these two, which did you prefer for reviewing previous submissions?

P16: My preference would be the one on the right is just cleaner. I like the list format as opposed to the blocks and it's just easier from left to right to see the category. The date that it was submitted. You know, I can see a preview of my question, if not the whole question and the status so much cleaner, cleaner and easier on the eye for me.

Researcher: OK, awesome. Well, that was my last question and I know since we are past time, I just wanna. I'm gonna gonna wrap us up. I guess. First, was there anything else that looking at all these different versions in this different experience? Was there any other thoughts that you had about? Ask VA that would be helpful for us.

P16: I OK, so one thing that would be easier for me is I primarily am submitting through on one area right work study.

Researcher: Mm-hmm.

P16: It would be helpful to have like a course. It has my my personal information saved right. So I can just look at it, glance, confirm and continue, but it's not that any of this is difficult, is tedious to do. Click, click. Click. Click, click when every single time it's the same thing. So what would be helpful for me? Because there's no way that in this position those things are going to change the state. The you know all that stuff. It would be nice to have that information either pre populated or just saved behind the screen so that I could just confirm.

Researcher: Hmm.

P16: So that I don't have to go through this whole, you know these categories each time that are not going to change considering that I've selected that I'm you know. I'm submitting under as a worksite supervisor, so let me kind of to to make that make a little bit more sense. If the option was there first for me to select what I'm submitting as or the role, then all the things associated with that role, it would be nice to have them. Kind of, you know, set up behind the scenes.

Researcher: Hmm.

P16: If I'm if I am selecting as a work. Supervisor then as a work site supervisor, I am currently with. Lone Star College in the state of Texas. You know that. I just think that there's some of that could be cut out.

Researcher: OK. Yeah, that's really great to hear your perspective. And just like to hear your whole flow and

P16: Mm-hmm.

Researcher: like how often you're doing these types of things. It was really great to understand your perspective on that.

P16: Mm-hmm.

Researcher: So that was all I had for us today.

P16: OK.

Researcher: Do you have any questions for me before I close this out?

P16: I don't again. My biggest things are the the communications. It it's with with someone like me that has so many.

Researcher: Hmm.

P16: When you're getting these emails, the confirmations are just an update. I can't decipher if it's just a generic. We're done with this. We process a time card versus which I don't necessarily. OK. It's processed versus there's a problem. There's a miscalculation. There's an issue. We couldn't process this. Because I can't. It is very difficult for me to stop every single time to log into the system, go back and find that reference number and figure out what's going on.

Researcher: Yeah.

P16: And I know this probably beyond your control. Mine and the next thing is how they send us the items back. There's it's now a situation in which every item has to be downloaded. Saved because the individual that's the recipient of that cannot access it is encrypted.

Researcher: Is that like through the responses you're saying? Like if they send you attachments?

P16: Well, so no, OK. So at the end of the day, once something is processed, say for instance I submit an application and they're sending me the that the the students is approved, then they're going to send me a time card for that student, a contract for them to sign, and then there. A. You know, kind of a summary of their eligibility for the program. So when I get that I used to be able to forward the e-mail along and say, here's your time card, here's your contract. Go ahead. Sign it. Send it back to me and I can't do that anymore. So for every person I have to download it, save it, then send it as an e-mail attachment. And I mean, I understand. You know, personal information, but I do believe there's not a full social on that. So I don't know.

Researcher: OK.

P16: That is probably my biggest thing.

Researcher: Yeah. No, that's that's really great to just again like kind of get a peek into your world.

P16: Mm-hmm.

Researcher: To to understand how you're interacting with with this system. So. Yeah. Thank you so much for spending more time than I had planned for.

P16: It's OK.

Researcher: I apologize for going over, but your your feedback was extremely valuable for us to just learn about how this works for you and how our tool really could be improved to to help you do your work better. In order to serve veterans. So thank you so much for your time again. Just like for the holiday and everything. Really appreciate it.

P16: Thank you.

Researcher: So I hope you have a great weekend and have a good holiday week next week.

P16: Alrighty, thank you so much. You guys have a great holiday as well.

Researcher: Thank you.

P16: Bye.
