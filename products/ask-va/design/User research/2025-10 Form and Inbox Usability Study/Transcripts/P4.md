Researcher: Okay. And so, now that I have officially started that recording, I did want to confirm one more time that you're comfortable with me recording today.

P4: Yes, I'm comfortable with recording.

Researcher: Great. Thank you so much. So, before we dive in, then, I wanted to open up, do you have any questions for me?

P4: None.

Researcher: Okay, all right. Now, before we look at the website, I just wanted to start with a couple of warm-up questions. In the initial survey that you filled out, you indicated that you use VA's education or training benefits. Can you tell me more about how you've used those benefits before?

P4: So, as far as, get into using education and training benefits, I get in, you try to go to the form. to apply for… I can't remember what was that form, I got it… And then you apply for the form, and then you get it all in there, and you submit it in. That's basically it. We're training.

Researcher: And… and yeah, so I guess, can you tell me a little bit more about, like, what you're using the benefits for? Like you said, maybe training versus…

P4: So…

Researcher: Education.

P4: For education, I was using it for my, My son's college. When I filled out all the forms. Submitted everything. I got a little frustrated myself, and I got the forms filled out, and then I took them to the VA, To a VSO up in Riverside County.

Researcher: And then he helped me with the rest of it. Okay. Yeah, can you maybe talk a little bit more about some of the frustrations you're experiencing with that process?

P4: So, I think the frustration of it was… so, my two sons both have, the name of William Frazier, so both of them, so there's 3 Williams in one house at the time. So, that particular piece of putting that in there, then once I got it all in, And then the school, so in California, it was… for CalVet. you could use the CalVet program, or you use Chapter 35, and then it's like, what is the other chapter number? So, just trying to get the different numbers of what they are. And that one, it was a headache. And then when I used it to take a… I took a computer course in Temecula, California. it was… and it was… that was my first time using it, and when I used it, Dan. It was just trying to make sure I got the school address in. And trying to understand So you have, say, 36 months of the program. And then how they measure it all the way down to the day, and I'm like, this is so crazy.

Researcher: Hmm. Okay. So, have you contacted the VA directly for any kind of support in, let's say, like, the last 6 months?

P4: Not in a… in the last 6 months, I just paid for the class that I'm currently taking now. I just paid for it out of my pocket. Because I went to a VSO, and they were like, well, it's only… it's a four-credit class. So I'm like, look, I don't really care about it, I'll just pay for it out of my pocket, and I didn't even do the form.

Researcher: Hmm.

P4: Nope. Okay.

Researcher: Now, have you… have you ever used a tool called AskVA?

P4: I can't remember using that one.

Researcher: Okay. Yeah, no problem. Well, thank you for just giving me some more context, for you and kind of what the education benefits have been like for you and your family. We're gonna move into the next part of this session, and I'm going to provide you with some different, like, scenarios and tasks to walk through, but I first wanted to start by having you share your screen with me, and then I'll be sending you a link here in the Zoom chat. So there should be a button at the bottom of the Zoom screen that's a green Like, square with an arrow in it, and that should enable you to share your screen with me. Okay, yep, I can see it now. So I just sent you a link in the Zoom chat. from our original Zoom window that you should be able to click on, and it should open up in the… that browser.

P4: It was just there, something popped up. What was, chat, okay. Got it. I just clicked on it. Okay.

Researcher: Okay, so as that pulls up, imagine that you've already logged into your VA account. and you're having an issue with, say, your work-study benefits, you've been directed to ask VA to get help with your issue. Before you click on anything here to kind of complete that task, take a second and look around and talk out loud about what it is that you're seeing.

P4: HPA get answers to your questions about the beneficial services. Well, when I look at it, I just say, I think within 7 business days is a long time to get an answer to a question, so… I think some people probably are looking… 48 hours probably wouldn't be too bad. about 7 days, if… I think if… yeah, if you filled it out on Friday. You're probably not… you're definitely not gonna get anything back until that next Monday, but… I think if I feel something, I'll ask a question on a Monday. The way that technology is today, I think. 7 days is just a long time. 15… 48 hours probably wouldn't be too bad. I think that would be okay. Swarm takes about 2 to 15 minutes to complete. Well, 15 minutes is a long time to complete a form. We can pre-fill some of the information, that's good. Since you've signed in, we can pre-fill part of your form based on your profile. Yep, that's good. You can also save your form in progress and come back. Later to finish it, that's a good thing. Ask a new question, Joe. When to use it. You submitted a question, yeah. Otherwise, that… I think that's pretty good. Besides the amount of time that's showing for. Response to our completion.

Researcher: Okay, so as you're seeing this for the first time, what are your expectations from AskVA?

P4: Basically when I go down and I click on that Ask New Question. It should just pop up, Maybe it'll probably just pop up to show my name. And then from my name, it'll probably just have something that shows… A block for me to put the question in.

Researcher: Okay.

P4: And then I put the precaution in, and… May… it may have my contact information. But being that I filled it out online, it should… the question… the answer should come right back to me online.

Researcher: Okay. Now, go ahead and show us how you would use ASBA to get help with a work-study issue.

P4: So basically, I'll just click on… Click on asking a question, deferring the personal information. John Smith, last four social… Date of birth, to protect your personal location. Yep. Oh, that's good. D. I guess being that I know it's gonna come back to me, all my personal information, I'm not… probably not gonna sweat that. Piece. Click continue. Yep, there's the block. 0%. Type in my question, want me to just type in something in here? Don't worry about it.

Researcher: Yeah, and, you won't be able to necessarily type, so maybe talk through what type of thing, especially based on your experience with, the different education benefits, what's something that you would want to type in here?

P4: So I say, let's say for education benefits, I would just type in, say, hey, look, I am applying for I have enrolled in a course at whatever the name of the college is. But I'm having problems trying to get in to access my benefits or whatever. To see… see if I wanted to see how much. How much more eligibility does I still have? Which I know I got, like, 9 days… 9 months in… so many days.

Researcher: I'll just type.

P4: Put that in there. It shows that I have 10,000 characters. I don't know if, as I'm typing the characters in there, if those numbers are going to… decrease. And then I go and I get finished with my question. And then I'll hit continue. It didn't do anything, but… So I'll go back. So, once I get finished with my question… I would hit continue.

Researcher: Yeah, I think you can go ahead and… yeah, go ahead and click on it.

P4: I'll just leave that right there. I clicked in there, that's in there. Haven't paid for my hours, I've worked through the VA's work-stay program. Can I get status of when I might receive them? That's good. I'll leave that in there and just hit continue. Carrier, select carrier that describes what your question is. No matter what. Okay. I guess this is here so you can go to the correct apartment. You know, so you pick whatever category you feel your question is in, So I'm gonna look… go down via that one talked about some work study and work hours. I'll look up and see each benefits position. Our benefits by integrating. Cousin assistance on loan funding and technical issue decision. I'm just gonna click, employment, put it in. I was still stuck. Okay, work-studied area. Said he was up there. Clicked on Work Study. I go down from work study. Now, I feel that this should go to the Work Study. Education and benefits and work study, whoever section who handles that? I'll click continue. get answers to your questions. Category Education and Work Study. Certificate of applicability… Career counseling. It's weird.

Researcher: Can you talk me through what you're thinking as you're reading this particular list?

P4: Yep, so my category topic, My question was in that, so I click, Education Benefits and Work Study, so I'm going down through here. And being that it's a work study, I'm thinking that… Education and career counseling, maybe? I don't know. One of these. So I'll click on one of these, I'll click on some… Oh, work study down at the bottom. Click on Work Study.

Researcher: So before you.

P4: Okay, go back.

Researcher: No, that's fine. I just had a couple of questions for you on some of these lists that you're seeing. What do they mean to you, and how important do you think that these questions are?

P4: License and testing, because… So I'll say, let's say, for instance, like now, there's a lot of courses that are out that basically people are just looking to get the money for license and testing fees. Say they may have a question on just testing the fees. And these are all in… In that area that… What are their questions? Transfer benefits, somebody may have a… but it seems like that should have been… once I clicked on that I'm going to work study, I don't know why all these… Continue to pop up. work study. Let's see if I go back… So, let's say, for instance, I've already collected my category, Educational Benefits and Work Study. I'm feeling that my question should go directly to that, instead of bringing me here again. And now I have the topic, and I have to go back down and find work-study again. And click on it. So let's say, for instance, if I think that… I feel that if I wanted some tuition assistance top-up, my question was on tuition assistance. Top-up, and… it came here, and… It was tuition assistant and top-up. And I clicked it here. When I come back here again. why am I still seeing it again? It's almost like double…

Researcher: I'm double-clicking myself.

P4: So now I click work-study. And go to work instead of you. double-clicking. You know, I don't know, could you see that, what just happened?

Researcher: Yeah, how important do you think these lists are?

P4: How do I… how important do I think the…

Researcher: These two lists are that you… this one and the previous one.

P4: I think it could be for reassurance. To make sure that, the veteran feels that they're… sees that they're in that… the spot that they initially clicked.

Researcher: Hmm.

P4: It could be for that. Just to make sure that they see that, hey, yup. So, in case they click back, they say, yep, okay, I'm going to Educational Benefits and Workshire. I click continue again, I'm going back through it. Oh, okay. Some may get frustrated and say, look, I know I just clicked it, so now I'm gonna have to go back there and click work-study again. And then that… you clicked it, and it brings you all the way back down again to it.

Researcher: Wonderful.

P4: I click it, I'm just thinking that, hey, once I click it, I can go to continue. So then I click continue there. And then I go to work-study, it just brings one… Okay.

Researcher: Can I ask one more question before, maybe we talk on this page? I'm curious what you would do if you couldn't find an option that fit your needs.

P4: If I go back here. Let's see if I go back and I don't find… one of these options that don't fit my need. I think I'll… I would go to something that's similar, or very close to it. I would probably go to Veterans Readiness and Employment, because.

Researcher: Hmm.

P4: The work study itself is somewhat getting me ready for employment. Huh? So I'll probably click here for Veterans Readiness and Employment.

Researcher: Okay.

P4: But that work-study was… yeah, I clicked work study. And then those are some of the problems, the application for work studies general questions. So my general question was, when am I actually gonna get paid? So… Could I go there? Because I've already submitted my time card. I already have a signed contract, so I'll just go general question. And click continue. Your attachment select options. Get into it. I don't have any attachments, because I've already, completed the, time card and submitted it, so I'm just waiting on… someone on the other end to the timecard person or whatever. But just in case if I had… I guess…

Researcher: Describe a time where you might want to attach something.

P4: Yep, let's say, for instance, I did, the work study, I was at a building, and they gave me in the timecarder, they gave me a receipt saying… a paper receipt while I had to volunteer, and I was actually… My work study dealt with volunteering, and I had to take a piece of paper around. And each… company had to sign off the number of hours that I did per per day at that company, and every Friday I turn it in. And, See, I had to take a picture of it, and then send a picture, so I would take a picture with my phone. send that… send that in through my email or whatever, and then attach it there as a PDF or JPEG or… pin foam. No, just attach it there.

Researcher: Okay.

P4: Can you? Why did it go back here?

Researcher: Yeah, I'll actually have you go ahead and kind of click into the attachment, as if you were attaching something.

P4: Okay, continue. Click and create attachment. So, let's say, for instance, That's the file. Change file, deleted, giant, an additional file. You can upload. Choose from a folder again, I click Another nation. So that's the file that's actually… You can upload, select a file. Let me go back to that. That didn't seem right. So let's say, for instance, what was that? Back. What's going on here? Back again. Okay, Walker, you're getting in trouble. If I could go back two screens. Go back one.

Researcher: And I think you could also use the back button in your browser.

P4: Nope. Won't work, it won't work, it won't work. What were you trying to… to do here? I'm trying… I'm trying to go back… So that way it'll, to the initial piece where it talked about. If I wanted to attach something… See, because on here, I can't… nothing highlights where I can do anything. One more.

Researcher: What were you… what were you trying to do when you went back?

P4: So… Can I go back one more stream?

Researcher: Yeah, it might not be working in that way right now.

P4: Yeah, it wouldn't work. So let's say, for instance, if I had a… if I had a folder. on my desktop, or whatever the photo was. So, I'm going back, and I want to do an attachment. That first… The one before… the screen before this showed something about an attachment, if I need to attach something. And then I click Attach, and then it's gonna bring me to this particular feature right here. And let's say there's a bunch of different folders where that particular, file set that I need to attach it from, so I'm gonna drag an additional… Click… choose a folder. So I'll choose a folder, and then I'll grab the file, grab that particular file, and then drag it over. or double-click on that file, now that file is attached, and then I hit… do an upload, and then I'll move forward from there.

Researcher: Okay.

P4: I'll click continue. What is your relationship to the veteran? I am the veteran. It's up here. Go to here, okay. Yep, here's all the stuff. You go to the state. The state is California, the residency state. This is the state where you currently live.

Researcher: Yeah, what do these questions mean to you here?

P4: So it's just trying to get them to fine-tune of where, that particular state is at, I guess, for… say, for, housing allowance, or the BAH, whatever, for the payment. So they'll know the payment amount to pay to the school for If you are applying for… To get the, the housing. Or there's different stipends. So this is the state where your school is located, so I click California, automatically popped there, but I'm, you know, all of the schools from A through You see what pop up, and I'll click on them. This is the state where you currently live. So, I guess this is less… just for instance, if I was applying for something, an online school, and that school was located in Arizona, or was Arizona State. The school's located in Arizona, I would collect Arizona. State where I live is California. So, just getting the disparity of where… where I'm at, or whatever. So, the residency state won't come up. I guess it's just… To me, it's tough, I could continue. My phone number, my email address. So that's… if it wasn't a va.gov, whatever my personal email address is, so that way it'll notify me there. Boom. Preferred name. That's new. If I had a preferred name. a nickname or whatever, I put it in there. Continue. Now, let's go back, it should, your being your question. It'll bring me back to my question, show me everything that I actually asked. If I wanted to change something, by the time I get to the end, if I wanted to change something. In words of what I wrote, I can go back in there and edit it. it's going to show me the file that I did attach, say, for instance, if it was that That time card that I had to take all those companies to get signed off, that time card will be here on the by attachments. You know, throw down the categories. of what I'm talking about, what I'm… that my question goes to. Education, benefits, and Work Study. The topic's gonna be work study. Subtopic, just a general question. Goes to… who's the person submitting it? Me, the veteran… My school information, where the school is at, San Diego City College. Phone number, in case my phone number was incorrect, or any of this information. was incorrect, I could edit it. Clark Andrews. Okay, Clark. Then I would submit my question. Okay, your question is submitted. It gives me a reference number. I know r- just… I was doing a… doing a… helping someone do a claim, and so it will send you an email to just say, hey. I would get an email that said, my claim was submitted, or my question was submitted to the VA. here's that, because once I close this out, all that's gonna go away, but an email, would be sent out to say, hey, you submitted a claim for VA benefits, here's your reference number, blah blah blah blah. That particular email will be sent to me, so that way I had that email also. You should receive an email within 7 business… 7 business days with a reply to reply. Okay.

Researcher: Yeah, you kind of talked about, like, what happens… what seems to happen next with that reference number. What would you do next after submitting your question here?

P4: It's… what I've been doing… I… I'll take a picture of it, so that way I still got a picture of it, so whenever, let's say, for instance, in… if this is Monday, within 7 business days, if… if I don't give the question… have an answer by Friday, I'll probably wait till Monday. call in on Monday, and say, hey, here's… I am such and such. I submitted this, if I got somebody on the phone. Here's my reference number. And this was my question.

Researcher: Just in case the person on the other end of the phone couldn't find.

P4: Couldn't see what I submitted. They could probably go back through and find it from my reference number, from that particular reference number.

Researcher: Yeah, and now that you've kind of completed the question, I just had a couple follow-up questions for you. So, on a scale from 1 to 5, how easy or difficult was it for you to complete this task? 1 being very difficult, and 5 being very easy.

P4: I would say 5, it was pretty easy.

Researcher: Okay. And on a scale from 1 to 5, how satisfied were you with the process? 1 being very unsatisfied, 5 being very satisfied.

P4: I'll say 5. I was, I mean, I was satisfied with it.

Researcher: Okay. And how did you feel overall with the length that it took you to complete the form?

P4: Overall, I was, I was good. I think… The number of drop-down items. there are a lot, especially once I first clicked on, work study, or whatever it was, and then I click that, and then it brings me to a bunch of other you know, drop-down menu of a whole bunch of other items in it I gotta look for it and find. I think it should… But that's just the way that system is built. It should clear-cut, go directly to it. I guess it's a double assurance to make sure the person is in the right place.

Researcher: Okay. Now, is there anything in particular that you liked or didn't like about the form that you filled out?

P4: Nope, it was… I mean, the form was simple. That someone answered, or gave your… if you had a question. It somewhat helped direct you in the… in the particular spot where you need it to be.

Researcher: Okay. And you talked a little bit about what you would do after you submitted. What would you expect AskBA to do next?

P4: So, like I said, you know. Wait, within 7 business days, somebody is going to email me back, and And answer the question. That's really it.

Researcher: Okay. Great. That wraps up our first task. I'm gonna… take us into our second task now. I have copied and pasted a new link into the Zoom chat. If you could get back to the Zoom window, and click on that link, it should pull up in your browser again. So as that opens, I'll kind of walk you through our scenario. I want you to imagine that maybe it's been a month since you submitted that original question. Maybe you've submitted other questions through AskVA, and you now want to go back and find that specific question that you asked about your work-study benefits. Show us how you would check on that question.

P4: So let's say, for instance, I go back to ask a new question, I will go in here. Search filter by… Okay, okay, it popped up. I've been on work hours, so it's gonna have a history of my particular question. It'd go through here. I could stroll over. I could go down, and I could… I basically would just go down and find that particular question that I sent in. So let's say, for instance. We're gonna say the one that I sent in is September 18th. So I go down enough, they said that they solved it, just to know that. Boom, I'll go back down and click on it. And I can view that.

Researcher: So what are some of the attributes you kind of talked about? You said, like, September 18th. What… what are you looking for, for your previous question?

P4: So I'm going to look for, say the category. That's good. They got the category over there of what that question was, so… I… if I see if I… I'm thinking back, and I'm like, whoa, what did I submit that question on? Oh, I submitted that question for my… My work study. Or I submitted that question for… physical therapy to request something on physical therapy, or I submitted a question, there was something on my pension. If it was on my attention, I'll click on… I could… there's somewhat… the category, how it's highlighted over here to the left. It helps me to narrow down, or to go directly to the area of the question that I submitted. But if I… let's say I submitted two questions on pension. Both of those questions were, say, pensions, so now instead of me trying to look at the education and disability. And then it somewhat gives me… And I'll use those two because they're in the… within the same month, and I'll just say they're categorized as pension. Something happened where… I have a question on pension, and then a week later, I have another question. And so I stroll over, and I say, hey, I need a breakdown of my pension payment. Because, see, let's say, for instance, I looked at something, and… I feel that they… the payment is off. And then I opened the question up, looked at it, read it. And then a week later, I come back and I says. my bank statement shows that I actually got paid for this, or whatever. So now I can go back in. Resent another question and just say, hey, look. My bank statement showed this on… 8th January, there was a deposit for… an overage. You know, hey, I'm getting… you know, $500 more than I normally get. And then… It shows that. on the 8th, and then on the 15th, I come back and I show that, hey, well… now I see that was corrected, and… the VA gave me whatever. And now I'm able to send in another question.

Researcher: Okay. So, thinking about some of those scenarios that you talked about, what information is the most important for what you see here?

P4: The date saying I submitted it, if it was… if it was solved. I'm sure I'll know if it was solved, because I'll come back and say, hey, look, I didn't get an answer to this particular question, or whatever. Is the question the same exact question that I submitted? The status of it is new. In progress, reopened, solved. That's good. The date that it was last updated, that'll let me know that. from the day it was submitted to the date it was last updated, where… it shows me the status of, say, a newly submitted question. I just submitted a question on Friday. Today is Wednesday. I can go in here on Wednesday if I haven't… received a phone call or gotten an answer, say, on Monday evening, I could go in and I can see, hey, okay, it's in progress. Where's it at? It's in progress. And it'll say… Whatever. Except there's 5 steps to it. This is a 5-step process. Misa, been the question is process one. Megan Answers Process 5. And I can look and I can see that, hey, oh, okay, it's in… it's at step 3 already. And then I'll know to say it. Within another 2 or 3 days, I can go back the next day. Okay, now it's in step 4, R.

Researcher: That's in step 5.

P4: If… let's… especially if it's… in case if it's something that the VA is going to mail out to me. And step 5 is that final step. The mail is in progress, and it's in the mail. So now I know where it's actually at.

Researcher: Now, is there anything else you would want, any other information you would want to see here? You just were talking through, like, a step 1 through 5 process, which is interesting. Is there anything else that you would expect to see here in order to see your previous questions?

P4: No, I think… I don't know what… I can't see what that… after the last update, but let me… Okay, view the details, gotcha. So I could actually view what the details are. Nope.

Researcher: And what order are you seeing your questions in here?

P4: We see, I see education, all the dates submitted. Are you saying what order? Timeframe-wise, or… Elena. Are you saying what order timeframe-wise am I seeing the questions?

Researcher: Yeah, what order are you seeing the questions in?

P4: From current date to past dates.

Researcher: And what order would you like to see the questions in?

P4: I think that's… that's good, because, I mean, I'll… not to say that… I basically want to know what… what am I currently looking at? Do I want to look at the questions? I don't want to see the ones that are… old and solved up top. Is there, you know, sometimes you can… ascending and descending? Latest and… Concurrent and latest. So that, that's a good order, I like that order.

Researcher: Okay. Is there anything else that would help you here to find a previous question?

P4: I mean, basically, the date submitted, the category that I submitted it on. That's somewhat it. I mean, it still… it shows the questions. You know. I think that's good.

Researcher: Okay. Okay. So, that wraps up our second task. We are actually going to… go ahead and complete some of these same tasks in a slightly different system. Some of these things you'll see are very similar, some are different. We kind of want to understand which experience you prefer. So, I am going to be copying and pasting some… There'll be a couple things that I'll be sharing with you in the Zoom chat again. There is a link to a website, and then our test email account, and a password. So, I'll have you click on the link first. And then if you can, copy and paste the email, to log in through ID.me. Yeah, and you'll kind of just, click through these prompts here, and I think you might have to remove the… yeah, you might have to select one on the bottom there. So yeah, you should just be able to continue through on these next couple of screens.

P4: What's the code they're gonna send me?

Researcher: Alright, so that is starting to log in again. And just as we did before, I want you to imagine that you're having an issue with your work-study benefits. You've been directed to AskVA to get help with your issue, so again, show us how you would use AskVA to get help.

P4: E. And we pre-filled some of the information. We can, yep, ask any questions. We got a question that was submitted, asked a question. It's gonna be a little noisy in the background, so I'm gonna have to mute at times here.

Researcher: No problem, no problem at all.

P4: 202… Just gonna check all my personal information. That's all correct, good. Go to continue. Start of the form. Category, so… which category did you want me to select?

Researcher: Yeah, so you're looking for help with, your work-study issue.

P4: Work study, work study. Premier. Understanding. Vineyard. Shake time. So, because it… I'm gonna say it was time-on, so…

Researcher: Okay.

P4: Being the veteran. Continue. But to the state that the school was in. I was gonna say the school is in Arizona, but my state of residence is California, just to… Change it up a little bit. Check my phone number, check my email address. There was a preferred name.

Researcher: So, on this page, how did you determine what to enter in the subject versus the question box?

P4: I just… in the subject box. I just stayed with what, what my question was going to pertain to. I just left my… left my subject with what my question was going to pertain to. You can figure out you went back off of… the previous slide, once I click what my area of my question was, I just… The subject wasn't there, so I just came in, put my subject in, work study slash timecard.

Researcher: Okay.

P4: Huh. The characters started out at 10,000, they'd get reduced down, and it did show me the number of characters I would have. Which is good. If there was something that I needed to attach, I would go here, choose a folder. Do you want me to do all that stuff? Don't worry.

Researcher: It's up to you. If you would… if this is something you would want to do, to submit a question, you can feel free to attach. If not, feel free to continue.

P4: I'm gonna pass it. I've already did it, and that's my only question. Thank you. Oversource. If there are any questions, I will come back here. You're only able to submit, that's just… able to edit some answers on this page. You will need to return to the early page to get sentences. Category, topic, education, benefits, and work studies. Buddy. So that way I can… time card for… I am the veteran. The school information, the state was Arizona, residency was California. Phone number, all that stuff. Checking over to make sure all of my information was correct. If I need to change anything, my mind shifted. There was a follow-up uploaded here. Come down to submit the question.

Researcher: Okay. So… Having gone through that process now, on a scale from 1 to 5, how easy or difficult was it to complete the task?

P4: straight 5, easy.

Researcher: And on a scale from 1 to 5, how satisfied were you with this process? 1 being very unsatisfied, 5 being very satisfied.

P4: Bye.

Researcher: Okay. Was there anything that you particularly liked or didn't like when going through the form this way?

P4: I mean, everything was there, and it was pretty easy.

Researcher: France? Anything that stood out that you didn't like? Okay. Great, we've got one more task to go through, and again, I'm going to… I'm gonna have you actually scroll up to the top, and then, under Frank's name, I'm gonna have you go ahead and sign out. And I'm gonna provide, some additional login information here. So I'll have you, again, click on the link in the Zoom chat, and there's a new email address and a new password that I'll have you log in on. And actually, I'll have you go back one, just looking at you pasting that in, I think there might have been a space at the beginning of that email address. We had some issues with this one yesterday, and I just wonder if there was an extra space there at the front.

P4: Nope.

Researcher: No? Okay, okay, I just wanted to double check before we tried to log in. All right, so as that logs you in, again, I want you to imagine that maybe it's been a month since you submitted that question, and you may or may not have submitted other questions through AskVA. Wanted to see… want you to go back and check on that specific question you asked about your work-study benefits. Show us how you would check on that question.

P4: I can hear, kind of pre-fill, ask a new question? Nope, it's not a new question, so I'll scroll down to all of my questions. So let's say, for instance, these are all of my questions, and this is… this is them, the questioner.

Researcher: Talk me through what you're seeing here, and how you're feeling about it.

P4: So, I'm looking at all of the questions that I recently submitted. It shows, you know, the ones that are in… all four in progress. So, let's say, for instance, I didn't… I know that wasn't my question, but I'm looking for the actual… the wording that I wrote, should I be looking… should I be finding that? I don't… I don't see the actual wording that I wrote, but… This is something different, right?

Researcher: So what would you… what would you be looking for? Like, what… what fields are you looking at, and what.

P4: I'm looking for…

Researcher: door.

P4: Let's say, for instance, if I copied or I took a picture of the reference number, I'll look there. I'll go to the particular category, and I'll look for what I submitted in. And then I'll look for my particular question. So I'll look for my question. Hold on for one second. Let me step away for a minute.

Researcher: No problem.

P4: Sorry about that.

Researcher: No, no problem.

P4: I'll be looking for my particular question, go to my question, I find it. Make sure everything is there, if everything is there, and I'll go and I'll click on… My particular question. Click on Review the Conversation. I'll go into the details of what my question was. That's good, it shows me… In progress, what my conversation was. Would be right here. And then I'll send a reply, if there was a reply. Say, for instance, if I'm asking, hey. If they sent something to me, It takes in a… an answer to my question, and if there wasn't… I needed to reply back to it, I would come back right in here, write in my reply to that. Let's say, for instance, they asked me for, now they ask me, hey, did the… Client give me a… a time card. That they wanted me to submit, and I forgot to submit it. So that was another question, and I was supposed to reply back to that. So then I would have to reply back in here, and then that gave me the opportunity to submit it in there.

Researcher: Okay.

P4: Yeah, I'll go back and out, okay. Go here, choose a file, click it, click on the file, choose it. Amen, I'll send it in.

Researcher: Okay.

P4: Respons to send.

Researcher: Yeah, if you go back to, Yeah, you might have to go back one more from there.

P4: One more.

Researcher: Yeah, kind of back to, where you were seeing multiple questions.

P4: Okay.

Researcher: Is there any… anything else on this page when you're reviewing or kind of looking for, a previous question that you might want to see here? Is there any other information you might be looking for?

P4: Question was submitted. In progress. Maybe, like I was saying earlier, if it has steps in it, if it's a 5-step system. That in progress, where it says in progress yet, if it could say… Step 2 of 5. Step 305. you know, okay, yeah, I know it's in progress, but what? How far along in the process is it? What's, you know, if there was a… that was a step system to it.

Researcher: Okay. And what order are you seeing your questions in here?

P4: descending. From previous to it. Concurrent to previous. So, October the 22nd, all the way the 17th, it's going… yep.

Researcher: And what order would you like to see them in here?

P4: I'll probably say the same. This order's good, because it brings me to the current date. And then it's going to the past, previous to past, current to past.

Researcher: Okay. So, we just have a couple more minutes, so I'm going to actually start to close this out. I've got a couple follow-up questions, because that was the end of our fourth and final task. So, I am actually going to go ahead and take over sharing screen really quick. To close us out with just a couple final questions. Okay. So, I'm gonna share my screen. Can you see my screen okay?

P4: Yes, I get my binoculars.

Researcher: These are kind of just representations. So, you experienced two different versions of Ask VA today, and… the… what you see on the picture on the left is kind of the first experience that you had, and the picture on the right was the second experience you had. So, I was wondering if you think back to Going through those forms in both times. Which one would you prefer for submitting a question?

P4: The second one. Because the first one, remember, it seemed like it just doubled up. It would go to the category, and it would ask me again. So I think they… The second were allowed me to type in Excuse me. would allow me to type in the area that I was able to… anywhere I typed in, work-study slash something, I was able to type it in.

Researcher: Hmm.

P4: That was… I was able to do that on the second one. That was good for me.

Researcher: Okay. And, one other question, a similar question. This is… We had to kind of walk through and look at a previous question in two different ways. So, the image on the left represents the first experience you saw, and the image on the right is the second experience that you just saw. So I'm curious, between those two, which one you preferred to viewing a question.

P4: I like the image on the left.

Researcher: On the left. Okay, so this one here.

P4: Yep.

Researcher: Okay. Can you talk me through a little bit why?

P4: Why? I guess because I read from left to right and now I don't… I've gotta go down the page to read up and down.

Researcher: I just…

P4: The brain is saying, hey, go left or right, not… Top to bottom, you know, I don't… That's… that's… For the day, it's… yeah, I could just… You know, because I'm looking from left to right real quick. Vice going up and down.

Researcher: Oops. Okay. Okay.

P4: And then I… and so… So you… I could see more of my questions there, vice me having to stroll up and down, let's say, for instance, there's two… only two blocks. But I still gotta go up and down my eyes just say, hey. From left to right for me was better.

Researcher: Okay. And if you think about the experiences you had with SBA, if you could change anything about the experience, what would that be?

P4: Not to say… I mean, it's simple, it was somewhat easy, It was good that it was, it was coming back to… Making sure it was me that was signing in, you know? But the two-way authentication, all that stuff was pretty good. So I can't say I… been in a… it's a test trial, I can't say I got… nothing really frustrated me or made me upset to… You know, smashed the computer, so… And that's early in the morning for me.

Researcher: All right, well, that was my last question, and I guess just thank you for your time. We really appreciate all of your insights today. I wanted to circle back and just kind of reconfirm that you're comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with any of our internal VA partners. We would remove any kind of identifiable information, and we just share these videos to just help others with improving VA.gov and those digital experiences. So, I wanted to confirm whether or not you'd be comfortable if we were to share this in our research findings.

P4: Yes.

Researcher: Okay.

P4: Yep, I'm comfortable.

Researcher: Thank you so much. Well, William, thank you so much for joining us early. I really appreciate all of the insight and the feedback. It was really helpful to kind of walk through this with you and understand your experiences. Lastly, I wanted to call out that Paragene will be sending you a thank you note, and they do provide, like, a little blurb that you can pass along to other veterans, that… to give them the opportunity to potentially, provide feedback in future research studies like this one. So if you feel so inclined to just continue helping us to create better experiences for you, we really appreciate that.

P4: Thank you.

Researcher: Before I close out, do you have any questions for me?

P4: None.

Researcher: Okay. Well, again, thank you so much. It was really great, kind of chatting with you today and walking through these experiences with you.

P4: Thank you. Have a great day.

Researcher: Great day. Bye.

P4: Okay. Take care, Walker.

walker: Bye-bye.
