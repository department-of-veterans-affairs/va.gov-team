Researcher: Should be getting started. Great. OK, so. Just I was wanted you one more time now that we've started the recording to go ahead and confirm that you were OK with us recording today.

P17: Yes, I'm OK with the recording today.

Researcher: Awesome. Thank you so much, Michelle. That was really kind of my last set of housekeeping and and getting us set up for for our session before we jump into some questions. Did you have any questions for me?

P17: No, I really don't.

Researcher: OK, awesome. I first just wanted. I kind of introduced myself a little bit. I would love to learn a little bit more about you. Can you tell us? Maybe just a little bit more about your role kind of your years of experience in the role. And I would also love to understand whether or not you yourself are also a veteran.

P17: I am actually. I retired after 24 years. So I am a Navy veteran. I've worked here for Columbia College for 15 to 16 years and when I started, I was the certifying Virginia official. Stenson, they've now centralized it back at the main campus. So while I don't do the certifications, I'm still on there for advising and I can go in and see what they're doing and stuff like that. That, but they wanted to centralized that position in Missouri. So, but I still do that. I use SBA almost every day, either for 'cause I'm a site supervisor for work studies and I run three different sites for that, so I'm in there all the time, timesheets, things like that. Any veterans that ask questions, I take them to ask Virginia so they can, you know, know that they can get the response that they're looking for. And I always tell people do it in writing. Because if you don't have anything in writing when it comes, push comes to shove. You know what do you have to prove? You know nothing. You can't prove that somebody told you that that was the way to do it, so. That's kind of the way I use it. You know, always ask, but and then you can always go back to ask VA and actually put it in writing and get somebody to Roger up to it.

Researcher: OK. Great. That was really helpful to kind of understand some context about your role. I was hoping you could, I guess. Thinking specifically about your role as a work study site supervisor. Kind of walk me through your overall process within that role specifically kind of noting how you're interacting with veteran affairs in that role.

P17: Oh, OK. Sure. I start from the application process. If I have a work study, either I have three different sites that I work for. If I have a new person applying for work study, I turn in their application form. I always review it with them, make sure it's all right. Then I I'll submit it. We'll get the contract and then I send it off. I'm always the middle man. I give it to the work study student. I get them to sign it, give it back to me. I upload it. So I am their on their point of contact for everything. Work. Study. I turn in their hours. Just today I turned in a request for. An audit on one of my students time cards. Because I don't believe they were paid properly. So we do all of that.

Researcher: OK. And I know you said that you do use SBA pretty frequently, I guess before thinking about the frequency there. I was also curious about how many students are I guess for the work study perspective, like how many students are you working with on a given semester?

P17: Oh well, I have two in Marysville. I usually have one here, but she just had a baby, so we're gonna have to hire a new person and I think 5 from the DAV office.

Researcher: OK. So I'm hearing like maybe like not quite 10/8.

P17: Eight. Oh, yeah. Not, yeah. Less than 10 usually.

Researcher: Less than 10. Is that like pretty much the average you would say per semester? OK.

P17: Yeah. And we run eight week semester, so we have to get.

Researcher: Oh.

P17: I mean, they could register for more than one term at a time. However, that messes with financial aid. So most of the time it's just eight weeks at a time, so I have to continually get extensions on their contracts every eight weeks, so.

Researcher: Wow, is that a new application every time then?

P17: No, you don't have to do a new application. You just you can get an extension for up to one year.

Researcher: Yeah. OK, OK. Yeah. And so you said, I think for for the work study site supervisor role, you are using SBA like daily like how many submissions would you say you're completing in a week or a month?

P17: Yes. Oh, maybe a week. Let's just say.

Researcher: Maybe a week maybe. Let's focus on a week.

P17: Five or six so far.

Researcher: OK.

P17: Something at least every day I have people that go to different schools,

Researcher: OK.

P17: so under the DAVI I'm a chapter adjutant for that, that group. So that's why I'm their site supervisor. So and most of them go to different

Researcher: Hmm. Hmm.

P17: institutions. And then for Columbia College, I'm the site supervisor for my location in the Marysville. Location. So those are all Columbia College students.

Researcher: Oh, interesting. OK. That's interesting to hear like that you're engaging with like you're the site supervisor for multiple locations, but not just your school even.

P17: Right, yeah. And that's because I work with the DAB also as a you know,

Researcher: Please.

P17: as a veteran I I am usually their chapter adjutant. So and I've just, I was their work study and I've just

Researcher: OK.

P17: stayed involved in it.

Researcher: Gotcha. OK, great. Well, that really helps. Just kind of set the stage for us here and understand your role and some of the context around those processes. I'm gonna move us into the next part of our session where we're gonna walk through a couple different scenarios and tasks,

P17: OK.

Researcher: and I wanted to start off by having you share your screen with us.

P17: OK.

Researcher: So within teams you should be able to do that for me. It's on the top right. It's a little square and arrow button.

P17: Mm-hmm.

Researcher: So once you share your screen, we're going to be in a browser and I just sent a link for you to. For you to click on and then I should be able to to see it once you open it.

P17: I clicked off the screen before I had time to click on it. Oh, it's a chat.

Researcher: Yeah, it should be in the teams chat. So if you can open teams back up, OK,

P17: I got it.

Researcher: perfect. And I am seeing your desktop. So if you've opened up the link, I do not see it yet on the screen that you are sharing. OK, perfect.

P17: Oh, hang on. It's went to another screen.

Researcher: Yep, no, I'm starting to see it now. It looks like you pulled it on to the right screen there.

P17: Yeah.

Researcher: Oh, I might have lost it again. I I think you had. OK.

P17: That's coming up. It's slow it loading all right. There it is.

Researcher: Yeah, I think I might still be seeing a different screen than you're sharing it on. You had pulled it over at one point, but.

P17: Are you seeing it on this one?

Researcher: I see like a, just like a red circle.

P17: Or this one.

Researcher: Oh Yep. OK there. I'm starting to see it, yes.

P17: This one. OK.

Researcher: Perfect. OK. So at this point I want you to imagine that you're needing to submit documentation on behalf of a student for some of their education benefits. You've been directed to ask VA to submit this documentation before you click on anything, take a second to look around and talk out loud about what it is that you're seeing here.

P17: OK. So what I'm seeing here is it's already logged me in. It says we can pre fill some of your information. I never do that. I just go right to ask a new question. Myself and then I'll click on ask a new question and then make sure it's here. It says John Smith. Whatever. OK, that's me. Continue and then.

Researcher: And I'll. I'll pause you just real quick for a second to go to go back just really quick. Just want to throw a little bit more about your thinking here.

P17: OK.

Researcher: I was curious when you're using the system, how are you getting to ask VA?

P17: ID me.

Researcher: OK.

P17: Through ID me, I go to VA Gov.

Researcher: OK.

P17: And then I click on. Training and education and I click on ***, Virginia. Then it asks me to log in and I have mostly ID me that I use a lot. So I'll click on ID me. I'll log into that and then it brings me to this page.

Researcher: OK. Great that. Yeah, I was just curious kind of your way of getting here normally, so that helps. OK, so you can go ahead and continue to show me what it would look like to submit some documentation through SBA.

P17: OK. So this is supposed to be me. Whoever go here your question, what's your question? Well, what would you want me to ask them for?

Researcher: Yeah. So maybe you could walk me through. Yeah, 'cause, you can't type in this particular demo

P17: Uh-huh.

Researcher: tool, but I'm curious. Kind of give me an example of what you might want to type in here.

P17: Usually when I go in here, I'm submitting. A. A time record. Or I'm asking for a new application or I'm in my question I'm typing. Can I get an extension for? One of my students with their ACN number and put that in there. But there's there seems to be a screen missing because there's something I usually do before this. So like it'll it'll ask me for the students information. It asked me. Well, I could pull the live one up over here and tell you the difference.

Researcher: Yeah, I think we want to.

P17: If you.

Researcher: We want to see how you'd walk through it here.

P17: OK.

Researcher: So go ahead and go ahead and continue as you might here and talk me through what you're thinking about it.

P17: Yeah, I would just write whatever my question would be. Attached please find an application for work study or attached as a timecard. Or so and so. Those are most of them. Or like today I had one, you know, requesting request an audit for a specific student with an ACN number of. And then I also put in the comments. You know what the issue is?

Researcher: Hmm. OK. You can go ahead and continue as you might again, as if I wasn't here.

P17: Oh, click it as continue, OK? Then I'm gonna do hang on. My mouse is crazy. OK, 5% complete. Alright, category then I'm gonna pick my category. Usually go with education and work study and then hit. Continue and I go down and it says, well, what is it that I'm looking for? For me, it's usually work study. So I come down to work, study, continue. It did not click.

Researcher: And I. Alright, hold on one second.

P17: It's not clicking.

Researcher: I think OK. Yeah. And I think I might have gotten the wrong link in there for you. So just hold on one second. Let me grab it. Sorry about that. I'm sorry.

P17: Is that it?

Researcher: OK, I'm gonna put a new link in the chat there. Have you kinda start over? OK. Yeah, let's try that link and then we should be able to go kind of walk through it exactly as you were talking about it here.

P17: OK.

Researcher: So that should come up in the teams chat.

P17: Yeah. You want me to close this original 1?

Researcher: Sure. Yeah.

P17: There it goes. Then I ask a new question. That would be my information and I would continue. What's your question? You know, would be a police processes timecard or. Attached as a time card for whatever student. From this day to this day term ending. So I put all that in there. Because I want them to know what I attached, so I always put that in as a comment. In case there's a problem, it's not letting me go.

Researcher: OK.

P17: What is your question? Do OK submitting OK. OK, category education benefits and work study. OK. Elected continue. Down at the bottom work study.

Researcher: And before you move on here.

P17: Can you, huh?

Researcher: I was curious. Those two lists that you were just looking at, and even this one as well, I guess I'm curious what these lists mean to you?

P17: Oh, OK. Let's go back. Now I just go back. On this, OK, so. Some of these benefits for survivors as chapter 35. If I had issues with the 35 certificate of eligibility or statement of benefits, I can probably request one, although they usually don't send those to me, or if there's an issue with one. Compliance survey I've done those. Whenever if there was an issue, you didn't go in there and say corrected based on compliance survey. Education and career counseling I would. I don't use that one. That's more of Chapter 31, licensing and testing fees. Actually I don't use that 'cause I don't really have anybody that wants to use that Montgomery GI Bill active duty. I do use that one. Montgomery GI Bill select reserves. I don't have any reserves. The Ojti don't have any of that. Post 911 but I don't. This this isn't the place where I would do my my documents for post 911. I would go in to the management system enrollment manager. So if I had a question about post 911, I would put it in here, but I don't.

Researcher: And.

P17: Reserve education. I don't use sixteen O 7 school certifying official. Yes, I can use that one like mine right now. My password is is not allowing me to get into enrollment manager so I can go in here and say hey I you know I'm AII have permissions to do this but my password's

Researcher: Hmm.

P17: not working. Please help me reset my password transfer benefits as toe. I can use that one, but mostly because I do have a lot of transfer benefits, but it'll usually be a question about. Maybe time or the student wants? To has a question about the transfer of benefits to their dependent or I have? A student who wants to. Resend their transfer of benefits. Usually when they're getting a divorce, and they usually forget to do that. So you know, we could say that or they can go.

Researcher: Hmm.

P17: Just go right into Mill Connect and resend their benefits. That's up to them. But I don't get a lot of questions on that.

Researcher: Hmm.

P17: Tuition assistance top up don't have a lot on that because it's also done through enrollment management. Verifying school enrollment. Am I going to enrollment management for that? Veterans readiness and employment have a lot of VR and E students, but I don't use this. They would use this if they had to talk to their counselor, I believe, but from my point, I don't. Do that. I don't reach out to the counselors that I work with using this system. It's usually mostly by e-mail. Chapter 32 don't really have it, and then work study. So mostly my stuff is work study.

Researcher: And I'm curious, you mentioned several times about like the enrollment manager. Is that a program that you're using

P17: Mm-hmm.

Researcher: specifically at your school or is that program that you're logging into?

P17: Oh, no, no, no. That's the V as. Website For enrollment manager. That's where we do all the certifications.

Researcher: Hmm.

P17: That's you, you. Everything goes through enrollment manager.

Researcher: OK.

P17: Is the right one.

Researcher: OK. And is there, I guess like any connection with that to like the questions you're asking here?

P17: Not usually. It's either one or the other. I mean, they're gonna go through enrollment manager or I'm gonna go through here. So. And that's why most of this I use is going to be for a work study. Now I can start using it if people have a question about. The Red Cell Act over transferring their benefits back, so I hear there's a 21 month backup on that process, but and they have to do it again through the VA form 22/19/95. Asking to have it switched. But if they had a question like, oh, I submitted this have what's going on with it, they could go in here and they could ask and they could. They're probably just going to get the same response. I get. Your application is being processed in the manner in which it was received, you know, or in the order of which it was received. But at least they get something in writing.

Researcher: Yeah. And what would you do if you couldn't find an option that fit your needs here?

P17: I just go to there used to be one that said question. I I would put. I don't know. Honestly, there isn't one that just says inquiry.

Researcher: Hmm.

P17: So I mean I get that they want it so they can, you know, this gets shot off to the right office for an answer, but. On the next screen you see just inquiry. So if if I'm not doing a timesheet, doing an application when I'm asking for an extension, I just click on that one like a general question. So.

Researcher: OK. And how important are these questions?

P17: Are these these topics?

Researcher: Yeah, the the previous question that you used and and this one, how important are these to you?

P17: They they help streamline it. I'm trying to get back to the last one before this one. Oh, the education benefits for work study. I I think they're pretty important because it does streamline the system.

Researcher: Can you expand a little bit on what you mean by streamline the system?

P17: Well, because this is gonna go to different different offices different. URLs I guess between them because who I talked to about Chapter 30 is not who I talked to about Chapter 31.

Researcher: Hmm.

P17: They're different. Totally different departments that that handle it. Tuition transfer benefits.

Researcher: Thank you.

P17: They really don't talk to me about Chapter 31, so it keeps everybody straight. If I have a question about specific topic. I can come here and find that topic and then it it goes right to the right office.

Researcher: OK. Great. Go ahead and continue as you would. Thanks for kind of letting me probe into your thought process around that a little

P17: Sure, sure.

Researcher: bit more.

P17: OK. So here's the application. A general question. That's the one I was telling you. If it doesn't fit these up here, these four, I go with general question. But usually it's timecard, you know, continue. And then I will after I I have to upload their time card in APDF into their file. Then I'll come in here and I will click here and I will choose a file to drag in or transfer over. And then I just continue because the file's there.

Researcher: And I'm curious just real quick on that with the attachments. Do you? I'm curious like how often you have attachments versus don't have attachments.

P17: The only one. I don't have an attachment for is an extension. Everything else has an attachment.

Researcher: Hmm. OK.

P17: If I'm just asking them to extend out their contract, that's all I put. You know the student's name. The student's ACN number request to extend their contract out to or. I'll say they they're certified full time from this date to this date request to extend their their contract out to this date. I can. I can do it. Up to a year, so I have to kind of keep that in mind and and sometimes it all miss the year and it'll be like oh. You can't extend it, so they have to go, then do a new application.

Researcher: OK. OK.

P17: And you can usually tell because usually you get 5 extensions. You have your your initial and five extensions, so when you get up to ext 5, that's when I start making sure that they're not passing their one year Mark.

Researcher: And when you said, you can usually tell like how are you just you personally. How are you managing like knowing whether or not there's five extensions for a person?

P17: Because I look at their time card and it's on their time card.

Researcher: Hmm.

P17: It's up in the corner. It's their ACN number. It'd be. In fact, I have one right here.

Researcher: She.

P17: So they'll put on there like, whatever the ACN number is the XT and then 12345.

Researcher: OK.

P17: That's based on number of times you ask, so you have to keep in mind that if there was a MIS.

Researcher: Michelle, are you there?

Researcher: OK. So the recording is started again. And yeah, there. I'm not sure if you can see OK do you

P17: It's good.

Researcher: have? Yes, I've not. I would need you to share your screen with me again.

P17: Sure. Sure. And I only I'm down to one screen now too, so I don't see what happened there.

Researcher: Oh. Oh my goodness. Sorry about that. That's.

P17: Does it show it's? Does it show it sharing?

Researcher: I do not see her scream yet, no.

P17: Share. The only screen I've got. So you got us.

Researcher: Alright, awesome. I do see your screen then OK. So yeah, we had gotten pretty far into this process. And so I think if we wanna, if you would go ahead and kind of just walk back through like just go through it pretty quickly.

P17: Chairman.

Researcher: And let me make sure.

P17: There is a question this was would have been my personal data. Whatever my question is, you're submitting documents for students to OK. Select the best that describes you. Work. Study. The general question is where I think we were.

Researcher: Yeah. I think the last one you had submitted was a time card.

P17: OK, time card.

Researcher: And I said you submit those up quite a bit.

P17: A lot, yeah.

Researcher: OK.

P17: Every 50 hours.

Researcher: Yes, that's right. OK.

P17: Or each one? So, OK. And then I would have drug a folder in. OK, then it adds up. Then it comes up and it comes up to. So this one is is out of order from where it usually is 'cause. This usually comes up before I submit any documents on them. It usually asks me this right after.

Researcher: Hmm.

P17: I do. Work study after I click on work it says how are you connected to this person?

Researcher: OK.

P17: So then I'm connected via veteran through my work.

Researcher: And what does? I guess when you talk about the order,

P17: SCO.

Researcher: what does that mean to you?

P17: The order of the screens that that so this screen should have been about four

Researcher: What does the order mean?

P17: screens back on the on what it looks like right now when you go in to ask VA. This one comes right after it says you know where I click on work study. It says. Why are you doing this? Are you the veteran? Are you the family member? No, I'm the school certifying official or work site supervisor.

Researcher: Gotcha. OK.

P17: OK, what is your role work site supervisor? OK, my state's Washington. You got California. OK, my contact information. Yeah, my e-mail usually pops up in there and then I always type in my person or my middle name, Michelle, because that's what I go by.

Researcher: Hmm.

P17: And then 98% OK then. So usually after I upload my file, this is the screen that pops up next. That says editing your answers and you can go in and make sure everything's in there. My questions are answered. My attachment is there, which is really important and then I click submit the question. That once it comes back and says it's submitted submitted successfully.

Researcher: OK.

P17: This comes to me as an e-mail about 3 or 4 minutes after the fact. That comes right into my work e-mail, but I usually just copy this because that's the reference number and I say, ah, timecard submitted. Here is the reference number, just so people know. That I took care of it for him.

Researcher: And when you, when you're talking about it that that way can is that like an e-mail or like what and where? Where are you copying and pasting that, OK.

P17: Yes, I sent him an e-mail e-mail from my personal work e-mail that just said, you know, they'll send me their time cards to my work e-mail, and then I'll just respond to them. I took care of this. I submitted this.

Researcher: Hmm.

P17: Here's your reference number, because then they don't get paid on time.

Researcher: Gotcha.

P17: We at least you know they. They can see that I submitted it on time. They can see that the day they sent it to me was either I sent it back for a fix or I submitted it.

Researcher: OK. OK. So on a scale from 1:00 to 5:00, how easy or difficult was it to complete this task and one being very difficult and five being very easy?

P17: Oh, it's it's a 5. It's very easy as long as you know the subject matter. It's very easy, but again, we're just doing work study. So it's very,

Researcher: Yeah.

P17: very easy.

Researcher: And on a scale from 1:00 to 5:00, how satisfied were you with this process? One being very unsatisfied and five being very satisfied?

P17: I think it's it works good. I mean it's changed over the years, but you know 'cause I've been here for so long, but this is a good system. I would. I'd give it like 4.5 you know.

Researcher: OK. Can you talk a little bit about maybe the difference between a 4.5 and A5 for you?

P17: Umm. Well, there's not a whole lot of difference there, but there's always room for improvement. And so if you think you've got it perfect, there's no such thing as perfect. There's perfection, but you know there's always room for improvement.

Researcher: Can you speak a little bit about what you might see as being improved here?

P17: I would say. Can I back up on it? I would make like this state state of facility. I think I would make that like a. You said it and then that's it because I'm never going to another state. So every time I have to pick Washington, drill down through it, pick, it's going to be Washington. That's that's my I need to be able to set that, maybe as a default. Maybe set my user name where it says what name preferred name? Maybe set that as a default?

Researcher: OK. And I guess, oh, go on.

P17: Because I really think each individual that uses this uses it from their own computer. So it's not like you're you're using a centralized computer where Dave might use it, and then Mike might use it, so might not let it set as a default.

Researcher: OK. And overall, how do you feel about the length of the form? Kind of what you were talking about a little bit, but I'm curious if you have more thoughts on it.

P17: No, I think it's good. I just, you know, it's a little bit out of order from what I'm used to seeing every day, but it's fine. It doesn't normally ask me right now as it's set up for about a question. It doesn't give me all that room for a question. It just asks what are you submitting? Who are you? You know, and then you can put a little note in there that. Says just, you know attachment included is. And then so it doesn't really. I like the question because if it is a question, I'll be able to actually have some space to write about it.

Researcher: And I guess, yeah, you've talked about the order. What would be overall like your preferred order?

P17: Well, I'm. I'm like a creature of habit, so I kind of like the way it was already set up. Where who am I goes to right behind. What? What is this about? Who are you? Are you the veteran? Are you the work study supervisor? So I like that screen backed up a little bit.

Researcher: OK. OK. And you talked about what you would do next after making a submission like this. What would you expect to ask VA to do next?

P17: They do it. They send me an e-mail that confirms that they have it. And they'll send me an answer in five to seven work days. So I mean they pretty much it. I don't think they need to do anything different other than you know, they acknowledge they received it. And and that's really it, I would like to be able to go further

Researcher: OK.

P17: back in all the questions that I asked because I do ask a lot. I do put different so everything gets a different serial number on it every time I ask something. So I tried to go back and I only go back like 8 pages.

Researcher: Yeah.

P17: But there's only two. So the way they have it set up now, when you first go in where it says, you know, do you want us to help you fill in your information or when you go back through there and you're you're looking for things that you've already submitted, you can only? Go back so far and like I needed something that was even a little bit

Researcher: Hmm.

P17: further back the other day. And I I just couldn't get to it because it only lets you go back like 8 to 10 pages.

Researcher: OK. I'll come back to that sentiment. I think I have some more questions along along that line here. In just a second.

P17: OK.

Researcher: I'm curious, I guess to I guess to maybe get us there though what might prompt you to return to ask Virginia whether it's for a question within those last 8 pages or something you would want to see like further back besides those eight, eight to 10 pages?

P17: I always go back into it because I'll get an e-mail that pops up in my regular e-mail from VA that says, you know, this inquiry has been answered. So I always go back in to see what the answer was.

Researcher: Hmm.

P17: Sometimes. I I think it would be better if they could. Maybe put a warning like something didn't have. There's there's something wrong with your submission or we didn't get the information we needed with your submission because and all they say is this. This answer has. This question has been answered. OK, so I don't know if there's something wrong with it or not. Wrong with it, I. Just go in. Sometimes it'll say attachment did not come through. Sometimes it'll say. You know, you forgot to sign it. Something like that. At which would be nice if it said that that there was an error, so that because if there's no error, there's no urgency to go right back into it, you know, but it the only way you can know that is if you go right back into it and. Read what the VA said. And it does happen. Sometimes things do get missed and you do need to go in and make a correction, and then the person saw like, yeah, I still haven't got paid and I don't know what's going on. So you go back in and it's like, oh, well, you forgot. To sign it. So.

Researcher: OK. And I guess along the lines of what you were saying before of like wanting to go further back, what might be an instance that you've experienced where you would want to go further back into the history that you've submitted?

P17: No, I just, it was on this one I just did today about the request for an audit. I want to be able to pull up every e-mail that I send on a person. So that I can show why I'm requesting an audit or why I'm requesting special consideration.

Researcher: Mm-hmm. OK. Any other instances that you've needed to look at things further back?

P17: I think it would be nice if if I could go in there and do it by an individual. So instead of just by the number, they assign it like. If once I get into mine, the things that I've submitted, if there was a way that I could search all of one person's name, everything I've ever said in on that person.

Researcher: OK.

P17: And I think that that would really help us.

Researcher: OK. OK, for the sake of time, I'm gonna move us into our next task. That kinda goes along with with the thinking here,

P17: OK.

Researcher: so I am putting a second link into our chat, our teams chat and I'll have you open up that that new link.

P17: OK. I'm gonna close this one, OK?

Researcher: Sure. Yep.

P17: The there so I can see what's going on.

Researcher: And I guess I do want to call out time. I know we kind of missed a little bit of

P17: With.

Researcher: time. So I'm curious if like how much time you might have to go a little bit beyond the hour, OK.

P17: I got as much time as you need. I have as much time as you need.

Researcher: OK. Great. I appreciate that. I will try to keep it to hopefully, maybe just like 15 minutes or so, 15 to 15 minutes past the hour is what I was hoping for.

P17: I'm just trying to. Blow it up so I can see the chat.

Researcher: OK.

P17: Show me more people. Maximize meeting window, OK. There we go. All right, so now you want me to go into this link here.

Researcher: Yep. OK, as that comes up? Imagine that you know, you were prompted to come back to ask Virginia to review a previous submission. You kind of just talked to me through a couple different examples that that might take.

P17: Right.

Researcher: Go ahead and show me how you would check on that submission using SBA here.

P17: Well, usually it comes in the e-mail. It'll give you a link to click on and then you can just click on it. But if you do it this way, you can just sign yourself in. Mine. Do not look like this. They're little square boxes. For each one, let's see. I haven't been paid for hours. I've worked through the VA OK details. Go to my details. Here's my question. I haven't been worked for the hours, OK and that should go through. You know. A supervisor, not just from the student because we have faster access to responses than a than just a student. And it usually comes down here into the inbox. Here's what the VA said. Response from the VA. Oh, it doesn't let me click on it. Oh, hello again. It looks at your records and found an option that might be better than the ones I sent over previously. Question I'm happy to jump. OK. I'm not sure what that's about. I want to know. I can get update about OK.

Researcher: And I'll actually, I'll actually have us go back one page

P17: So usually I'll come in.

Researcher: and uh kinda just land on on that page and focus a little bit again just for the sake of time to kind of focus on.

P17: OK.

Researcher: What attributes of your previous submission are you looking for when you come in here?

P17: I am looking for the number that was assigned. None of this.

Researcher: And what number? Make sure I just wanna make sure I understand which number.

P17: It's it's the number assigned to it. Well, I can't even go to one. It'll have the date and then it'll have the number assigned through SBA and it

Researcher: OK.

P17: shows you that. So it's basically it's the submission date and probably the job number that it gave you. But we aren't personal. Or are we on business? Oh, we're on personal, that's why. If we were on business, it would look a little different.

Researcher: OK. OK. And how would it look different or how would you expect it to look different?

P17: Because that's where it shows me. So this is a personal account. This is only about this one person. This this is as if I, the veteran, was asking a question about myself. I wouldn't use the business under the business. Now the business one I use for all of my work study students for anything that deals with work goes under the business. That you know that account for business.

Researcher: OK.

P17: Because then it lists each one out, has a person's name,

Researcher: And.

P17: has a person's account, it has the the tasking number that was assigned to it. So then when it pops in in my e-mail and says. Ask BBA has responded. Here's the number they responded to. Click here to get to it. Then you just click there. It takes you right to it. You still have to log in, but it brings it to the top.

Researcher: OK. That's good to know. Kind of just your flow is like usually from an e-mail directly into like the details that you were just looking at. Is that right?

P17: Right.

Researcher: OK. When you are looking for things like more broadly here on this page. It sounds like and maybe I'm, let me just reiterate what I heard is that maybe the reference number was the most important information that you're using to look for a previous submission here. Is that accurate?

P17: Yes, yes, the date and it's usually like the last three reference numbers 'cause it'll be, you know it'll be 123 or 649 or you know

Researcher: OK.

P17: you wanna make sure you're matching them up.

Researcher: OK. And so based on what you see here, is there any other information that would be helpful to see to finding a previous question?

P17: Yeah, if you could search by name. That that's not an option in what we use right now.

Researcher: OK.

P17: These filters that are across the top here as a personal issue as a as a

Researcher: And if.

P17: personal account don't don't show up in the business side.

Researcher: Hmm. Is this something you would wanna see?

P17: Yeah. So it it would definitely 'cause that again then I could search for all of the questions on just one person.

Researcher: OK. And what order are you seeing the questions in here?

P17: Oldest one first. No. Well, I got a January 30th, a January 31st, January 12th of January 8th. So they're not actually in order. They're in order of date submitted. They're not even that October 25th, January 24th. That's the oldest. OK, January 24th, September 23. OK. So they're in here under date submitted. Not not last updated.

Researcher: And what order would you want to see your questions in?

P17: No, I I do like the date submitted, but I don't think you need. Both dates to show actually. Or just, you know, have have him that I'm not quite sure. Are you tie them together? I like the way it does it now based off the number that was assigned to it as a reference.

Researcher: OK.

P17: The status under the status as new. That's new. That's nice.

Researcher: Is there any?

P17: In progress, reopened solid. See now that we can't reopen things, they say this is this ticket has been closed. Submit a new request if you want to continue on with this conversation,

Researcher: Hello.

P17: which drives me crazy 'cause, you should be able to keep it open. Go back and forth between you and the VA as much as you need to till you resolve the issue.

Researcher: OK. And what differences might you expect when reviewing questions as a veteran rather than as a work study site supervisor?

P17: But I don't. There shouldn't be any difference. The differences in the timeliness because ours as a site supervisor get bumped to the front.

Researcher: Hmm. Hmm.

P17: And and I mean, I have a student that will ask the very same question and three weeks later they're waiting on an answer and I've already got an answer. So it's just a timely response to the individuals that slows down.

Researcher: Hello. Interesting. OK.

P17: Just it's the same thing with the V as hotline number. You know, I can pick up the hotline number and call and get an answer right away as a certifying official where a veteran is going to stay on hold for a couple hours sometimes.

Researcher: Hmm. And as, but the veterans can use the hotline as well.

P17: Not my hotline number. No, they have to use just the one 800 number.

Researcher: Oh, OK. Oh, I see.

P17: And it's kind of how this is and that's how this is business is the ones that

Researcher: So there is a separate, OK.

P17: fall under business or answered differently than the ones that fall under personal.

Researcher: OK. OK. So we're actually that was the end of the second task. I do have two more tasks for us to complete.

P17: OK.

Researcher: You're actually gonna be completing the same tasks in a slightly different system, so some may be similar while others are different.

P17: OK.

Researcher: We really want to understand your overall preference of which experience. Which experience you prefer? So I'm gonna put a third link into our chat here.

P17: OK.

Researcher: And so you should see that coming in and you should be able to click on that one again.

P17: OK.

Researcher: All right. So as that comes up, just as we did before, I want you to imagine that you need to submit some documentation on behalf of a student for their benefits. You're doing that using askva. Show us again how you would use askva to submit this documentation.

P17: OK, this is where it brings me to. After I do my ID me. Let's see. Ask a new question. Questions. You haven't submitted any questions, so I ask a new question. The personal information, that's me. Or supposedly. All right, get answers to your questions about OK, select A category. Education. Select the topic. Work. Study. Sub topic time card. Here it is. See now this is in the right order. OK. What are your work site supervisor? Here again, this is the one that never changes. I'm still in Washington state. Continue. My phone number preferred. There's your e-mail, so preferred name. I would like I said make it where you set it and leave it. Alright, your questions. This is the one that's in there. Now this is exactly the one that's in there. Now subject. What's your question? That's usually where I put in there, you know? Well, put their name up here, whether it's a time card application, whatever it is. And then down here, I'll just say, you know, see attachment this or or time card attached. Ending this date, whatever it's going to be then. I drag in my folder.

Researcher: And how do you choose between what goes into the subject versus what goes in the question here?

P17: Depends on what I'm turning in. So if I'm turning in a time card, I'm gonna put in a timeline or in the subject last name, first name, time card, and then down in the question. I'm gonna say something like attached is Jasmine time card ending On this date so that they know if it. Not that one ending on that date, there's a problem. Or the time you know running from. Oh, you know, the 8th of the month through,

Researcher: OK.

P17: you know, the 20th of the month. Whatever it's going to be, just so they have a clear indication of what it is I'm actually trying to give them. And then choose and drag your folder in which will be that timecard and then I'll

Researcher: OK.

P17: continue and then it usually pops up with.

Researcher: I think you can click on this on this example.

P17: The oh I have to click on it.

Researcher: Yeah, go ahead and click on it and it'll. Yeah, just kind of move us forward.

P17: OK. Yeah. And then. 98% complete. OK, then this is where this is the exact one that's on there now. And then all of this pops up and then you just submit your question and then it pops up right here. So your reference number is, so this is a date. This is 2023 June 22nd of 2023, and here's the number that they assign it.

Researcher: Hmm.

P17: And that's what I was talking about. So I can go back and find that date and and 4:58 will be there.

Researcher: OK.

P17: It usually pops up at the front.

Researcher: OK.

P17: So when this e-mail comes into my when this comes in, this is the one that's kind of outgoing. And then when the VA has responded, I get an e-mail in that says we've responded to this question and it'll have that number. And then I can just there's like a click here to go right into Virginia once or I just go into Virginia. Gov. And navigate my way to that question and that number and that's my answer. But what? I don't like is like if they did say they refused to accept it. They just say. You know, time card declined, missing signature instead of saying timecard declined and then allowing me to respond to it with the signed time card.

Researcher: Hmm.

P17: I have to start a whole new question because I don't want to go back to the

Researcher: Ah.

P17: old question. So I usually have to say this is the second submission of this time card based

Researcher: OK.

P17: off reference number. Whatever you guys said it needed to be signed and here it is signed. So I would. I think it would be easier if they would allow you to use the respond. I mean it's there. Why not use it?

Researcher: Yeah. OK. So going through this process similar questions before on a scale from 1:00 to

P17: Mm-hmm.

Researcher: 5:00, how easy or difficult was it to complete this task? One is very difficult and five is very easy.

P17: It's very easy.

Researcher: OK.

P17: It is exactly like the other one other than the screens are being in a different order. This is exactly what I just looked at. I don't think anything really changed

Researcher: OK.

P17: other than the order of the screens.

Researcher: OK. And on a scale from 1:00 to 5:00, how satisfied were you with this process, one being very unsatisfied and five being very satisfied?

P17: No, I'd say it's still the 4.5. It's still got the two errors that that I mentioned before, not errors, but they could. They could be streamlined to allow you to put in your name and let it keep it in there and pick your state 'cause you're not changing states either.

Researcher: OK.

P17: Or maybe give you an option to have it set permanently. Like, do you want this permanent? Like yes or no, you know and then if you want to go back and forth, you can, but you don't have to it. It's not much of A time saver, but every second helps.

Researcher: OK. So I've got one more task and again just to kind of be mindful of your times, as I know we're already over. I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna go ahead

P17: Oh, we're good. We're good.

Researcher: and put that last link in the chat for us to open up.

P17: Mm-hmm.

Researcher: So as we're as that's opening up, I want you to again imagine that you know, someone else prompted you for additional support with a time card issue or similar to this most recent one. You were doing that you talked about of, like going in for an audit and. Maybe going to review some past questions for for that person.

P17: Mm-hmm.

Researcher: Use askva here to review some of your previous submissions.

P17: OK. So again, you get all signed in and then I come here ask a new question. Oh, I want to just go review. See how this one is set up? This is a business, or maybe it's just a way this the screen's set up, but this is the way I see mine. Just like this in progress new open review conversation. So. I went back and I tried to find everything on one person but this. Let's see. Status. I don't. I don't know if that won't let me play with it. But this is more of what my business one looks like.

Researcher: Yeah. So how might you wanna use this status field to like go in and search for

P17: I.

Researcher: something that you're looking for here?

P17: I would like to be able to search it by last name. Or you could search it by date or a range of dates.

Researcher: OK.

P17: The category I mean all of mine are going to be work study, but I've never used that. So I don't know how it filters. It probably does filter under all those different topics, but the only one I ever use is work study.

Researcher: OK. And what information is the most important from what you see here?

P17: Well, here's the newest submission. Let's see. I haven't been paid. For the hours I've worked to the VA's work study program, OK. So review the conversation. I want to know what now the response from the VA was. And then your reply to the VA you can't do this because they say in here. This this question has been closed. Submit a new question to open another conversation.

Researcher: Hmm.

P17: So I don't get to. Use this your reply to the VA very often.

Researcher: OK.

P17: So I think it it, it's worth it. I like it that way 'cause it's easier for me to. Just keep the chain of conversation going on that one person.

Researcher: OK. So you're saying that you are not able to submit a reply here?

P17: Right, because usually it'll come back and say this question has been closed or you know, timesheet denied for no signature this this request has been closed. If you want to discuss it again start a

Researcher: No.

P17: new one.

Researcher: OK. And if we go back one page, is there anything else? Yeah, I can go back in browser. Is there anything else here that might be helpful to you to find a previous question that you're looking for?

P17: Review submitted on the 18th. There's a reference, a last name. There it is. Nancy Drew. OK, David Jones. No, I don't think so. I think this is pretty good. I mean you can either search it by reference number or by if you could search it by last name.

Researcher: OK.

P17: That would work either. One subject matter works.

Researcher: OK.

P17: But I think you're going to get more with last name and reference number than anything.

Researcher: OK. Great. Let's see. Think that. That was my last question there. I do have some kind of overall close out questions that I would love to just get your input on and in order to do that I am going to actually take over the share myself.

P17: OK.

Researcher: And let me just. OK. So let me take on the share screen.

P17: So I got to stop sharing. So you can share, right?

Researcher: You. Yeah, you. I can. I think I can take over the share. So can you see my screen?

P17: Yeah. Yes.

Researcher: OK, so you got to experience two different versions of Askva today. So we've got a representation on the left of the first version you experienced, and a representation on the right of the second experience that you just had.

P17: Right.

Researcher: For submitting documentation, do you think back to both of those experiences? Which one did you prefer for submitting your documentation? For a work study.

P17: I like the one on the right, the way it's already set up, because I've already learned it. Honestly, I mean I. And really there's not a lot of difference between the two other than moving around the question.

Researcher: And can you talk a little bit more maybe about why you preferred the one on the right and and even just thinking about it like you said why you prefer the one that you're using currently?

P17: I I think that the questions flow a little bit. More succinctly, as far as who, who, why, what, where. OK. Now. Now tell me. So you you you have The Who? The why? The what? Who are you? You know, as far as in putting this information, I think all that should be towards the front. And then in the end is where you say you know. Here's the subject. And here's the attachments.

Researcher: OK. And can you expand a little bit on on that from your perspective? Like what's maybe the benefit of that to you?

P17: That's familiarity, but. I I you know, I don't think anybody. Would have an issue either way I it's just the way I like to do things. Personally, I think it flows better when you get The Who, what, why, where, when. All done and then elaborate.

Researcher: OK. Yeah. And I guess I think we're probably taught referring to like those the category and the topic as the what like you are The Who answering those types of questions and then answering the questions about the what maybe is there anything that you can expand upon about the? Importance of the what? So like the category and the topic.

P17: Well, you see this on the on the one on the left. The very first thing it asks you is what's your question, OK.

Researcher: Uh-huh.

P17: Well, who are you to be asking this question? I want to know that before I answer any questions for you. So that's why I like to see it the other way. That you're the work site supervisor. You know you're submitting this on behalf of the student. All of that type of information verify who I am before you ask. Let me ask you a question.

Researcher: OK. And can you explain it?

P17: And that this might be the military stuff in me. But you know,

Researcher: Hmm.

P17: who are you and why do you need to know? Always is the first thing you always ask.

Researcher: OK. OK. Is there anything else in particular? So if you focused on the one on the right that you preferred, can you tell me anything else that you really liked about that system or didn't like about that version?

P17: Again, the only thing I don't like is that we have to keep filling in the state and our preferred name. I think those are fields that can just be fill it in once and lock it down.

Researcher: Yes. OK. OK.

P17: Everybody has a different login to ID ME or ask BA when nobody uses anybody else's login. So there shouldn't be any reason not to be able to lock down those values.

Researcher: OK. So I have one last question here. You also had two you got to experience two different versions of ask Virginia as far as going and reviewing a previous submission. So you can see the two versions here. Of that, there's one on the left. That kind of is a representation of the first experience that you got to do to review a submission, and the one on the right is that last one. We were just looking at. Do you had to choose between these two

P17: Mm-hmm.

Researcher: for reviewing a previous submission? Which did you prefer?

P17: Well, honestly, you can get more on the one on the left so you can get more references because it's just a drop down on the one on the right with the boxes. It's nice, but you can only get 4 on a page. So that's where you have to start paging through.

Researcher: And how many would you expect to see on a page here?

P17: On the right or the left?

Researcher: Well, I guess in general, how many would you want to see on an individual page regardless of either one?

P17: Oh well, I would like a scroll button so I could just scroll to the bottom. All all of them. You know what I mean? You can. You can go page by page or you can just show me every page and let me scroll through without having to hit next page. Next page next page. And let me work it that way.

Researcher: OK, OK. So I heard that you you preferred the one on the left. Can you expand anymore on anything else that you specifically liked about the one on the left?

P17: Well, the one on the left though, does it well because it's a personal one, doesn't have the reference numbers on it. I do like the reference number. At least I can't see it. It's kind of small. I don't have my glasses on.

Researcher: Sorry about that. Yeah, I can. Maybe I don't know if I can zoom in here very well.

P17: It's OK. Do you see reference numbers on the left?

Researcher: OK.

P17: I don't. I see topic I see date. But the one on the right.

Researcher: Yeah.

P17: The one on the right has your reference number, which is what they always go back to.

Researcher: Gotcha. OK. Yep.

P17: So and submitted date reference number and then what the category was. I like that set up, but I like to be able. To have more on a page than just those four little boxes.

Researcher: Gotcha. OK. Is there anything else overall? Just like looking at either of these that you that you really liked or really disliked to review a previous submission?

P17: Hello. No other than what I told you about when you do review a submission and then they tell you that they canceled this number. And they don't allow you to respond. They're not just not letting you use the respond box. And I think that's just the way that they prefer it. Like they closed it out. This number's been closed out. Start a new number. If you wanna talk about it again. I think that's more for their their work habits,

Researcher: Read it.

P17: rather than having to go back and review open cases. But I imagine that they could have a queue that kept all the open cases in one queue. Thank you. And again, it's also accounts. You know, they try and close things out as fast as they can, and I know why they do it. They're doing it because it's. It tracks their progress. And so that, you know, it's kind of like how many did you get through today? Well, I closed out 42, but did you answer 42 or did you, you know what I'm saying? Did you really close out 42 or were 30 of

Researcher: Yeah.

P17: em like you needed more information?

Researcher: Yeah. So is it like you think?

P17: Let's close it out just to say you closed it out and that counts towards production.

Researcher: Hello. Yeah, but in reality you might have had to resubmit 30 out of those 42 like for you kind of thing?

P17: Exactly. Exactly.

Researcher: OK, OK. No, that's. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Just hearing your perspective on it and and kind of what we think is happening on the back end, that's really helpful.

P17: Mm-hmm.

Researcher: Alright, I'm gonna go ahead and stop sharing. That was, I think really the last line of

P17: Thank you.

Researcher: questioning that I had for you.

P17: OK.

Researcher: Just want to go ahead and close this out. Thank you so much for taking some time with us today. Michelle. It was, yeah.

P17: Absolutely. Thanks for asking me. Thanks for asking for my opinion.

Researcher: I'm yeah. It was just great to see the context of the work that you're doing and kind of your process and and how how it interacts with what we're doing here at VA. So yeah, I just really appreciate all your open and honest feedback. Talk about everything and coming back on after whatever happened with with the Internet there. So I appreciate you staying long.

P17: Yeah, I was trying. I was like, oh, I hope they're still there and like.

Researcher: Yeah, I dropped for a little while. Then I saw you come back up.

P17: Yeah.

Researcher: So I'm glad that teams told me you were back on.

P17: Yeah, yeah.

Researcher: So that that was all I had for today.

P17: Well, good.

Researcher: Do you have any questions for me before we go ahead and close out?

P17: So you were asking me about enrollment manager. Do you guys not work with enrollment manager at all from this SBA side of the House and?

Researcher: Yeah, I will. I will say personally I was not familiar with it. I focus mainly on the things that are kind of like veteran and SEO and work site work site supervisor facing like kind of outward facing. There is a whole bunch of other things that go on internally and so I am not as familiar with those parts of the process. And so you definitely. Highlighted some things that I need to go and figure out to see how these are. Interacting with each other.

P17: I would think that because it is an SCO who does the enrollment manager and they're the ones that usually come question. Here's the one of the biggest ones that we come up with and I know because I did it for so many years was we have two different school codes. Just because, say, somebody has a parent school and and secondary school, OK, when you go to certify them. Sometimes a VA only processes 1. Even though we send them in on two different days, they think they're looking at the same thing again. One is an online class, so one is an in seat class or one is an in seat class at one school and one is an in seat class.

Researcher: Oh.

P17: They just process it as one and that person then doesn't get paid properly because they don't have enough credits. Their work study gets messed up.

Researcher: Yeah.

P17: Not not certified for enough credits.

Researcher: Uh.

P17: That is a problem that happens a lot, especially with work study.

Researcher: Hmm. And is that happening though, like within the enrollment management system, as you're you're saying like that kind of

P17: Yes, it happens in both. It happens in both.

Researcher: OK.

P17: Enrollment management may process it right, but work studies reading it wrong. It's like but 6 credits is full time. And here's the one for one facility code.

Researcher: Yeah.

P17: And here's the one for the other facility code for the same date, so that equals whatever number it equals. So that is a problem, but I would have thought that.

Researcher: Yeah.

P17: These two systems maybe would talk to each other a little more.

Researcher: And and honestly, that's something that I'm glad you brought it up because that's something I'm gonna go dig into a little bit more and understand. And there might be there might be communication for like the folks that are answering these questions and seeing the enrollment management system but. As far as like this front end that generally veterans are seeing and like submitters like yourself there, there's not like a direct connection.

P17: Right. They don't see the SCO side.

Researcher: Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly.

P17: Yeah, they they don't see that side unless I e-mail it to them. So and sometimes you know, but that that that is just a little point

Researcher: Yeah.

P17: of contention that happens quite often. And when it look I'm a veteran, I got it. I lived off my Bah and everything else and my work study money and when that

Researcher: Yeah.

P17: gets messed up. You start having a crisis. You know, some of these people live payday to

Researcher: Yeah.
