Researcher: And now that I've started that recording, I'm gonna once again ask you, can you confirm that you're okay with me recording this session?

P13: Yes, I'm okay with it.

Researcher: Alright. Awesome. Well, that was kind of all I had to set expectations for our session today. Before we dive in, did you have any questions for me?

P13: Nope.

Researcher: Okay. So, let me just get us started with a couple of questions. In the initial survey that you filled out, you indicated that you've leveraged VA's education or training benefits. Can you tell me more about how you've used those benefits?

P13: Well, I've been in the military a long time, and when I first got out of the military back in the 80s. I use the VA educational benefits, I think it was called the Montgomery GI Bill, but it's been a while.

Researcher: Okay.

P13: Later, I was in college, and in the… reserves are guard, I'm not sure which, at that time, but I also… oh, Guard. I… I can't remember. And I use the… what was it called? The Garden Reserve GI Bill.

Researcher: Hmm.

P13: And… I think I used… Did I use any post-9-11? No, I don't think I did use any post-9-11.

Researcher: Okay And if you can remember back, did you have any challenges, receiving those specific benefits, those education benefits?

P13: Not… not that I recall. I just remember it was my first… You know. interaction with VA, having just come out of the military, and I remember like I guess I expected, you had to manage your own… process. You couldn't expect it to just happen for you. You had to reach out and ask questions and make sure you Manage it from your end to get it what you were expecting in a timely manner. It wouldn't just happen to you, necessarily.

Researcher: Okay.

P13: But I expected that, and that's the way I approached it.

Researcher: Okay. Now, thinking back over maybe the last 6 months to a year, have you contacted VA for any kind of support?

P13: Oh, yes, a whole host of support, yeah.

Researcher: Can you maybe describe for me maybe your most recent experience of looking to VA for some support?

P13: Probably most recently, most of that was medical-related. I'm, 100% of my medical is through the VA. So, whether it's… ongoing… Care and tracking of… healthcare issues, or something that might have cropped up healthcare-wise, I would have contacted the VA, or… Started an interaction to address an issue or answer a question.

Researcher: Okay. So, can you think of an example of when you might have done that, and, like, how you went about contacting them, or getting, like, the help that you need, or ask a question that you had?

P13: Involving… the medical interaction, probably… mostly what I do is I first either attempt a… whatever it's called, the… the VA Sort of email… messaging process on.

Researcher: Oh, no.

P13: Mine. But in some cases, that may have evolved into a phone call, or it may have… a separate issue may have involved a direct phone call to my primary care provider team, or… or maybe a specialty team. At the local, yeah.

Researcher: Okay. So it sounds like mostly in contact through, like, through the messaging application, or, over the phone, is that right?

P13: Yeah, most likely.

Researcher: Okay, and have you ever used a tool called AskVA?

P13: I'm aware of it, but I… I don't know if I've actually used it, or I may have, but it was way in the past, I don't recall.

Researcher: Yeah, no problem. Well, thank you for giving me just some context to, your experience with education and with support with VA. That helps me to just understand kind of where you're coming from as we talk through some of these tasks going forward. So we're gonna move into the next part of our session. And I'm going to be providing you with some scenarios and tasks, and I wanted you to start by sharing your screen with us. So, you should be able to do that within the Zoom window. There should be a green button at the bottom with an arrow in it. And that should enable you to share either, like, your browser or, your whole screen, and then I'll be sending you a link, once you've gotten your screen shared.

P13: Okay… I clicked the various buttons, now I got Screen recordings, window up, but…

Researcher: It shouldn't be screen recording, it should… the button at the bottom of the Zoom should be share.

P13: I click that.

Researcher: Okay.

P13: when I clicked that, I got this window that says… The meeting is, there's a white window, application window, entire screen.

Researcher: Yeah.

P13: And then it says share at the bottom of the blue button.

Researcher: Yeah, so pick which one. I'm not sure, kind of, what your setup is, but if you're comfortable sharing your entire screen, then we'll be pulling up a browser, and that's what we'll be doing all of our tasks in today.

P13: Well, there's some… several options, and let me look at this for a second. Google, Unknown. Desktop. Okay, desktop is highlighted, Google Chrome Mail… okay, so desktop is highlighted, but then off to the right it says Presenter Layout. That would be you, right? Or is that me?

Researcher: Yeah, and I think that you… you probably don't have to change anything on the presenter layout.

P13: only is selected, so I'll hit share again.

Researcher: Perfect.

P13: Allow Zoom Workplace to share your screen. Open System Settings. Privacy and security to grant access. Open System Settings, click. Okay… Now I'm back to your screen, okay? Now I got the screen recording window up. shows my menu on the left with me and various functions, and then on the right, it says Cisco Web Meetings, Google Chrome, and Zoom. So maybe I should…

Researcher: Yeah, so for Zoom, if there's, like, a checkbox to turn it on and off, I think that's what you're looking for, yeah.

P13: Now it's asking for a password.

Researcher: It should just be, like, your computer password, I think.

P13: We'll see.

Researcher: Whenever you log in to the computer.

P13: Speak a couple of times.

Researcher: No worries.

P13: Oh, "… Okay, no, okay, let me try another one. I don't do this that often, so I don't have any… okay…

Researcher: Yeah, I think… Trying to think if that password… that should be, like, your… kind of your admin password of whatever password you might use to log into the computer.

P13: Yeah, but… I don't ever do that.

Researcher: Oh.

P13: Because I don't… you know, I mean, I do it so infrequently, I don't really recall that stuff.

Researcher: Yeah.

P13: See if I can find something here… I'll get it, just takes a minute.

Researcher: Yeah, no worries.

P13: I didn't know I was gonna have to study.

Researcher: Sorry about that.

P13: No problem. I tried a common one… Okay.

Researcher: And I'm wondering if we can't get that working… let me see if I can… We'll give that, like, one more minute to see if you can… are able to.

P13: sucked.

Researcher: that. Otherwise, I might be able to share my screen and have you control it remotely.

P13: Okay. Yeah, I've done this so infrequently, I really don't know what I'm dealing with here.

Researcher: Okay. Well, yeah, then let me try… yeah, if you can't remember it, let me try to share my screen.

P13: Should I hit cancel on this?

Researcher: Yeah, I think you can… why don't you go ahead and… we'll at least try this. I've done this a little bit before, so you should be able to see my screen, is that correct?

P13: All right, should I close this screen recording? Yeah, okay.

Researcher: Yeah.

P13: Blue screen, yeah?

Researcher: Okay, you can see my screen, great, and you can just see… can you just see, like, the browser open?

P13: It says, ask VA, and I see you up top.

Researcher: Okay, great. So, what I'm gonna do here is I'm going to give you remote control.

P13: Okay?

Researcher: And so now, if you use your mouse, you should be able to… you should see my mouse cursor here. Yeah, you should be able to move things. Okay. Okay, great. So, I might have to take back the mouse a little bit every once in a while, but, okay, so I wanted to walk you through a scenario. So, you've already logged into your VA account, and you're having an issue with your work-study benefits. So, imagine that that was the case, and you've been directed to ask VA to get help with your issue. Before you click on anything to complete this task, take a second to look around and talk out loud about what it is that you're seeing.

P13: Is it possible to make this larger by… let me see if I can do this this way. Okay, there we go, now it's larger. Okay.

Researcher: Great.

P13: Picture questions, you can just form, there's two things when you can…

Researcher: So, talk out loud to me about what it is that you're reading, and what.

P13: here.

Researcher: Thinking about what you're reading.

P13: Just scanning for relevant information and trying to Push away the… what I'll call the nonsense that may not be important for what I'm trying to do. When you ask me your question, if you haven't… Okay, so, got it. So, now I understand the screen, what… where I am and what I'm doing.

Researcher: Okay. Okay, so talk me through what you're seeing here, then.

P13: I see the SBA screen, get answers to your questions, and then it gives you a comment about pre-filling. It says you can ask a question. A comment about it will pre-fill some things. It says there's a link where you can ask a question. Then there's notes about, you know, for data about when you ask VA some more further information, which I don't need. And then your question, you haven't submitted one yet, so… It's ready for me to ask a question. Then there's a need help on the bottom. Is it…

Researcher: Okay. And what are your expectations from AskVA so far?

P13: Well, I… I'm assuming that I'm stuck on something needing some information, so I would click the link to ask the questions. As is typical with the VA, there's a lot of information, most of it not really relevant to what I'm trying to do. I see the Ask a Question link, so I would go right to it without really doing any more than scanning it, as I've already done the rest of the screen.

Researcher: Okay, and how long would you expect it to take to get the help you need through AskVA?

P13: Well, I'm… from this point on, I'm anticipating a couple more screens with similar kinds of clogged screens full of information, very little of which would concern my direct issue.

Researcher: Okay. And again, just think about, like, how long would you expect it to get the help you need? From VA. Cool.

P13: You know, probably 3 to 5 minutes from here.

Researcher: Okay. Go ahead and show us how you would use AskVA to get help.

P13: So, you click on the Ask New Question, click that. okay, there's some personal information about me, supposedly, then it would continue. I wouldn't read anything, I'd click continue. Then, 9% complete, that's good to know. Category. Now I would select what I'm asking the question about. You know, because it's obviously very broad and very… You know, there's a whole lot… we'll say healthcare, for argument's sake.

Researcher: And this scenario is kind of given you in a scenario to imagine that you're having an issue with your work-study benefits.

P13: Okay, so I'm looking for education and work study. Okay, yeah, so there's the selection. Oh, it's already selected. Okay, now I would click continue. Okay, your category and topic. Now, what are the details? Work, study, certificate of eligibility… So I'd scroll through these, and then I'd… Fine. any one, and I'm trying to look if you can click one or more than one, I can't quickly see it, but I would click one or more than one that are relevant to the question I'm asking. Work-study, bang. Okay.

Researcher: And how… how do you interpret these lists? Like, what do they mean to you, this list and the previous list?

P13: Well, these are some options available related to the topic that I just clicked on in the previous screen, or the screen I was on last time. So. This was a work study… work… the education options came up here. I was… went on work study last time, so I'm looking for something relevant here. I scrolled down, I… not really that familiar with work study per se, so I'm reading these a little bit to see what they are. I'm familiar with a lot of them, and when I scanned to the bottom, I saw work study, so that must be what I'm looking for, and I clicked it, and I would click continue.

Researcher: And how important do you see these questions? So, this one here and the previous list, how important are these questions?

P13: Well… It depends on… Okay, it's important in that I'm looking for specific information, and what I have is a whole lot of information. in this screen, roughly related to VA education. Much of it is irrelevant, because, as you posed to me already, I'm looking for work study. So the entire list is almost completely irrelevant, but it's nice to know I'm in the correct area, and I'm looking for details that might apply to me, and when I got to the bottom, I saw word study. It happened to be at the bottom because of the alphabetical list. no surprises.

Researcher: Okay. And what would you do if you couldn't find an option that fit your needs here?

P13: Well, I might tend to go to the back button to make sure, because I'm… Pushing through these screens rather than really studying them.

Researcher: Not to the relevant point.

P13: This is not for me so far, if I were using these screens. This is to get to what I'm looking for, so I'm not really reading the screens in any detail, and if I couldn't find what I'm looking for, I'm gonna assume I missed something on the last screen. I'd go back button and try to study that a little more. Little more detail.

Researcher: Okay, and you said something, that I was hoping you can expand on. You kind of said, these screens aren't for me. Can you expand a little bit more on what you're… what you were thinking about with that?

P13: Well, I'm assuming I got on this Ask VA for assistance in a particular issue. when I go to VA, as is typical, I'm getting… a very broad range of options, and I have to go through this process to pinpoint the issue or subject matter. First, it starts with the subject, like education, then it'll scroll, you know, it'll focus in more till I get to, like, here with work-study. So I'm expecting a lot of options, most of which won't apply to me, I'm looking for what's relevant to me. without spending a lot of time, because I'm not… you know, there's a lot of information on the screen, and I'm assuming… I'm making the assumption, with my degree of familiarity with VA processes, that much of it will not apply. I'm looking for specifically what I'm looking for, in this case, work study.

Researcher: Bye. Okay.

P13: My only comment about all that is there's always seems to be a lot of options. Not a few, not… 3, 4, or 5. But 20, as this example shows.

Researcher: And I guess, maybe, could you talk a little bit about the impact of that?

P13: Well, it, it, it… I don't know if it's… I don't want to say it's frustrating yet, but I'm trying to get to something, and this is… The arduous way of getting there. And I use the term arduous because I would rather just have 3 options, click the one I wanted, but I understand… That we're narrowing down a subject matter as I focus in, and it's gonna take some processing to do that.

Researcher: Okay. Yeah.

P13: It's not… it's not… The computer can't read my mind, unfortunately, and I wish it could.

Researcher: Okay. So, those are all the questions I had for here. Go ahead and just kind of continue on as you would as you were kind of trying to get help with your work-study benefits issue.

P13: I'll click continue. Notice I'm 25% complete. That's… Encouraging subtopics, what kind of work study, application general question, position details. signed contract and time card. Now, I'm reading these more carefully, because I'm personally not familiar with.

Researcher: too much to go in the area of work study, so I'm reading these carefully to figure out what might apply.

P13: To me, or what these topics might be. Because we're getting down to greater detail. And so what subtopic am I looking at? I… I… In your scenario, because you're giving it to me, I have no idea. So I might say application, or… you know, it depends on… I need more information.

Researcher: Yeah, and I guess if you didn't… if you didn't have a lot more information, what would you go ahead and do to continue?

P13: Well, I'm not sure where I am in the process, so I would probably first check to see position description, maybe I'm signing up for a work study, then I might go to sign contract, kind of get where I am through the process. Have I already signed a work study contract? I might then flip up to application. to see if I've done the application, I wouldn't go to general question, because I don't know what I'm asking yet, so I don't have a question. And time card is meaningless to me, so… I would select one of those and probably click continue, I wouldn't tend to go to… the need help link at the bottom, the phone number, because I guess I would imagine that I would have more information about what it is I'm looking for if I had gotten this far to this screen.

Researcher: Okay. So, I'll go ahead and kind of, just kind of help us along here, and at this point, I will have you select General Question.

P13: Okay.

Researcher: And… and continue from there.

P13: Okay? There we go. What… now I'm 75, and that's reassuring. What is your relationship to the veteran? I am the veteran. Boom. And then I would click continue. I didn't read anything else, just click continue. School, state, or resident required? schools… state, so the state of the school, I would… Select… And then… residency state, I would select whether I'm in the same state as the school or the state I'm residing in, you know, my permanent residence. So I would select those and click continue. Again, without reading much detail. And now I see 80% full, so now I would tend to rush. Because I want to get through this and get to the point of why I logged in.

Researcher: Hmm.

P13: But having the 80% complete is very reassuring. I'm nearing the end.

Researcher: Okay. So how would you continue at this point?

P13: Well, I would pick, the state of the school where it may be, and then my state of residency, which is New York. I would select those two things and hit continue. The school is listed as in California here. Residency doesn't let me pick anything. But I assume it would on the… Real screen, and then I'd click continue.

Researcher: So go ahead and, as you would, again, if I wasn't here, go ahead and continue on.

P13: Okay, so I can't click the state of residency. I mean, I click that down caret, and it doesn't give me an option, so I just click continue. There we go. Now… 85%, your contact information, I would review it to make sure it's, correct. preferred name, let us know. I would type in my name that I'd like to be called, and I would click continue. Again, without reading in great detail. Now, your question. So I'd go to the subject, and I'd pick a… what I'll call a topic heading. What am I… it's a general information screen, so what am I looking for? Using, work study to pay for a secondary college education, because I already have one, for example. And then I would list a specific question, That they have…

Researcher: Sweat.

P13: Here for me.

Researcher: Can you… yeah, you can't type into this particular prototype, so you were kind of walking me through what you might… put into the subject. So similarly, I wonder if you can talk me through, and you can even use your own personal example of a time where maybe you've wanted to ask a question of VA. What might you put in the subject and in the question here?

P13: Well, because I hadn't used work-study, I'm not really that familiar with it, but this is work-study payments. Okay, so I'm in work-study to help me pay for school, so I want to know about my payments, that's what's listed there, or I would type there, and then I would ask a specific question about my payments, like, how often do I get paid, or when does my payment start, and how often do I get paid, in as much detail as I could muster. Again, without spending too much time and noting. once again, that I'm 90% complete, and I want the answers, I don't really want to spend any time, asking specific questions. So I'd get as detailed as I could without Beating a dead horse. Then if I needed to attach information, I would go down and attach a PDF, and click continue.

Researcher: And can you think of an instance, like, in your own experience, where you would want to attach something to get the help you needed?

P13: Well, like, if I had received a document regarding, in this case, work-study payments, like, that I hadn't received a payment, it showed no payment paid, if I had a document to that effect, or it showed that I had gotten payments, I would attach that for clarity to show that I had gotten payment, or that I got something that said I had no payment, and then I would attach it for clarity in helping the computer answer my questions, or the people that are receiving this, and I would click continue.

Researcher: Okay. And I wanted to probe a little bit more, again, if you were to maybe think of… and this could even be, like, something… you talked about healthcare earlier on when we first started chatting, about an area that you've needed support in, so I wonder if you were asking a question about something like healthcare, what might be your subject and your question in that instance?

P13: Subject might be something like, Maybe, results of recent blood work, and then said we did, we did recent blood work concerning my anemia. What, what does, what's the relationship between.

Researcher: my anemia that you've told me about, and these hemoglobin numbers I see on the blood test.

P13: Or, to the degree I know it, because that's one thing I know is an issue, and I'm a little confused about.

Researcher: And how do you go about forming the question that you might ask in a system like this?

P13: I would use the… VA parlance, meaning I would either do what the… System is… assisting me in generating, I would ask the questions or make the comments in that sort of language, or I would use language that, if I'm referring to something that I talked about with my doctor, to the language, like I just used in the example that I spoke about with my doctor, as specific as I could. to cut out the wheat from the chaff, you know, make it as clear as I possibly could.

Researcher: Yeah. But I wouldn't…

P13: A great deal of time on it.

Researcher: Okay. Any other thoughts on this page?

P13: No, it's just that, you know, the work-study category is probably one of category in the VA… systems that I'm not familiar with.

Researcher: So it's much more uncomfortable than almost any other category.

P13: Category we could have chosen.

Researcher: Okay. Yeah, and we can kind of, like I said, kind of talk in this scenario, as well as maybe a scenario like healthcare that you're maybe more familiar with, so I'm good with kind of talking through both as we go.

P13: Yeah, I, you know, if it was, if it was, healthcare-related or, or, or, you know, benefits related, I could… Attach a, benefits notification letter or a benefits decision letter. Ask a question about what the benefit It's confusing me about the benefits.

Researcher: Hmm.

P13: information I just received, and let them know, you know.

Researcher: Okay. Yeah, that gives some additional context, so I appreciate that. Okay, at this point, you can continue on, again, as if I wasn't here to kind of continue getting the help you need.

P13: I asked to put the subject in, I asked the question, or… and then I attach the file as relevant, and I click continue. Now, I'm 98% very reassured. Editing my answers. Now, I… would look at this and say, okay, I'm not gonna spend a… hardly any time on this, because I already know what I put in. I would just scan to make sure I didn't miss something, like, I'm not the veteran, for example, but it says I'm the veteran, so I'm good, so I'm scanning up and down, or down, I should say, checking all this data. If I needed to edit it, I would. I'd check my email address, I'd check the question again, but I wouldn't really read it in great detail, and then I'd submit question. See if there's an attachment there, and then I'd submit questions. Boom. Your question was submitted successfully, I'm happy.

Researcher: Okay. So, on a scale from 1 to 5, how easy or difficult was it for you to complete this task? 1 being very difficult, and 5 being very easy.

P13: I would say 5.

Researcher: Okay. And on a scale from 1 to 5, how satisfied are you with the process? 1 being very unsatisfied, and 5 being very satisfied.

P13: I would say 4.

Researcher: Can you expand on that a little bit for me?

P13: Again, as I mentioned before, it's exactly what I expected. The process is exactly what I expected, what I would call a typical VA process.

Researcher: It's not the most user-friendly process.

P13: with interaction on the computer that I've ever seen in my experience across The civilian world, for example. But it's exactly what I expect from the VA, and I understand the language, and it helps me speed through it, because I do understand it better.

Researcher: Okay. You talked a little bit about its user-friendliness. What's something in particular that you didn't like, or that you would improve in the process you saw?

P13: again, to the degree I could, I would want to see less, what I'll call irrelevant information. less altogether on the screen that isn't helpful to the reason I logged in in the first place. There's a lot of… for lack of a better word, there's a lot of ancillary garbage on the screen that just distracts and takes time from the reason I came in here. I'm not coming on this… this… site to impress anybody. I'm here for an answer for me. I'm being perfectly selfish, and I want to get through it.

Researcher: And is there… can you, like, describe specific examples of the things that you thought were ancillary?

P13: There's a lot of… border information and all that nonsense on the bottom of the screen, there's just a lot of information that isn't relevant to me, the question I ask, or how I get to the answer. There's one or two lines relevant to that on most screens, sometimes in the review section, more relevant lines, and I quickly scan those, but even those have a lot of other nonsense on the data section 2 that isn't relevant to me. I'm looking for the data that I'm looking for that I either inputted or want to know.

Researcher: Hmm.

P13: And I see a lot of other white noise on there.

Researcher: Okay. Yeah, thank you for that. I guess at this point in the process, what would you plan to do next?

P13: So… My question was submitted.

Researcher: I would probably jot down the reference number, because I…

P13: have a 100 degree… 100% degree of trust, and I have a feeling like I might have to go back and go through an arduous process of trying to figure out the status of my question. So I'd jot down the reference number, and then I would figure out where I go to… or how long it would take to get an answer.

Researcher: Okay.

P13: Either funding, or how long it would take.

Researcher: And how… what would you expect AskVA to do next?

P13: Well, I see my options here. The question was successfully submitted. I can return to ask VA, which I don't really have a reason to, because I've asked the question back to the top, which I don't have a really… have a relevant reason to do, and feedback. So I would see nothing I have left to do, except wait to figure out how I'm gonna get a response. So I would probably just click out.

Researcher: Okay. Off the screen. And I do think you kind of already answered this, but I'll ask it explicitly. How did you feel overall about the length of the form?

P13: It was a bit arduous, but not unexpected.

Researcher: Okay. Okay. Anything else about… that you wanted to chat about with this process?

P13: No, I, I, I… feel like I could do it and get The answer… eventually get the answer that I was looking for.

Researcher: time.

P13: I… I'm not surprised I don't have it right in front of me on the screen, right here, right now.

Researcher: Okay. I'm gonna move us into our next… task, and since you're on my screen, I'm gonna pull it over here. Get to see a little behind the scenes.

P13: Okay?

Researcher: Okay, so I'm gonna… yeah, let me… Set myself up here… okay. And then you should still have control of the mouse there. So, I want you to imagine it's maybe been a month since you submitted that question, and in that time, you may or may not have submitted other questions, but you want to go back and see that specific question about your work-study benefits. Show us how you would check on that question.

P13: Okay, so I got… I'm at this screen, ask a new question. No, your question, filter by, and I would click filter by, I would go to work study. Filter by category, one of those will have work-study, one will… all is probably education. So I would go there, no, can't do it. Okay, then all… then, filter by status, I'd look for education, filter by category, I'd look for work study, and then I'd click apply filters, and I probably wouldn't spend any much time reading, though, I would note, probably, that I submitted something, and I would look to see if that was the thing I was looking for, right there on the… on the submitted October… 20th, 2025, just see if that's what I'm look… looking about, assuming I, you know, because it shows I have other options here.

Researcher: Yeah, so what attributes, you've talked through it a little bit, but maybe more explicitly, what attributes of your previous question are you looking for?

P13: Well, I want to get a status of my work study question. I'm looking for the answer to the work study question I had previously asked, either a day or a week before, and the first thing I noticed up top was that, you know, or maybe it was the previous screen, but it said something about, 2 to 20 minutes, or something like that, and I'm looking to make it 2. So I'm starting this process, whether it's one day or a week later. Some degree of frustration already. It should come to me, and I gotta go search for it.

Researcher: Okay. And of the information you see here, what is the most important?

P13: I see 4… sections about issues in front of me. One is news, so that's probably the last one I asked. The other in progress. Or one's in progress. I don't know what the bottom… one is solved and one is reopened. I'm only concerned with the reason I came back on the screen today, probably the new question I just asked and haven't heard about. So I'm seeking an answer.

Researcher: Okay. Is there anything else that you don't see here that would be helpful to you to find a previous question that you asked?

P13: I would say probably not, because I'm not looking for any of that. I'm looking for one thing and one thing only, and that's the answer to my question.

Researcher: And…

P13: That's where my… what I'm drilling towards.

Researcher: And so, in looking for that, is there something you're seeing here that's helping you understand, what the answer is, or if there is an answer yet?

P13: Well, I see the new here, which is my question here about education. Down at the bottom, it says review conversation. I'm dreading doing that, because that's going to tell me about what I've done, not necessarily about what I've… what, what the current status is, but since I have no other options, I'd probably click on Review Conversation.

Researcher: H. And what order are you seeing the questions here?

P13: I'm not, because of the format. I would prefer them listed, rather than in 4 boxes stacked. Because it took me a wa… and the… and the… the, the, The banners up top are hard to read. When new, in progress, reopened and solved. They're hard to read, hard to see, and not at all… capturing me, so I had the whole… those four boxes, when I was on the screen as is now, scrolled down like this, I didn't even really care about those 4 boxes. They were just more data that the VA puts on the screen, not kosher. not… not… I'm not looking… I'm looking for an answer, and that's just…

Researcher: Hmm.

P13: white noise.

Researcher: Gotcha.

P13: focused and saw that this is a new one, now I gotta focus on that a little more. But I'm not looking at those other boxes at all. And I wish they were stacked rather than… You know, in… in order, where new was one line up top, and the others were below it in some manner, maybe by date.

Researcher: Yeah, I was just gonna ask that, like, what order would you expect to see them in?

P13: Probably in the order I get it. You know?

Researcher: Can you expand on that, just to make sure I understand?

P13: The oldest one is at the bottom, the newest one is at the top, and they're in order.

Researcher: And when you say oldest, is that by what you've submitted? Is that what you're saying?

P13: The only thing I care about when I submit a new question.

Researcher: Okay.

P13: And the status, of course. Like, I see the ones resolved, I'm assuming, or solved. I'm assuming I don't care about that, and I wouldn't even read that box.

Researcher: Okay. Okay. Is there anything else that you particularly liked or didn't like about this view?

P13: Again, the… the… what I'll call the banner new, in progress that need to be bold and easy to see and read. So I knew the new box was important to me. And right now, it isn't. I couldn't even see those. banners on this screen. Now, that's partly because I'm looking at a screenshot of your screen. I get that, but it's not a bright color, it's a gray, it's hard to read, it's not bold.

Researcher: Hmm.

P13: So that doesn't work for me.

Researcher: Okay. Okay, great. Well, that closes out our second task. We do have a couple more tasks, and we're actually going to be going through and completing the same tasks that you just did, but in a slightly different system. So, some things may feel very similar, while others are different. We really want to understand your overall preference, for the two different experiences. So, I am going to, again, copy… Another link over here. Okay, so again, and let me get myself set up over here, just as you did before, imagine that you're having an issue with your work-study benefits, and you've been directed to Ask VA to get help. Show us again how you would use Ask VA to get help.

P13: Seeing this screen before, I would go right to ask a new question and click on that. now I would… see my data there. Without even reading, I'd click continue. then I would… Click on the box and ask my question, and click continue again without reading. Seeing the 0% complete and already getting frustrated. Now, 9% complete, select a category. Again, I would choose the category, such as work study, whoa. No, education… where am I? Now, I don't like there's too many options, hard to distinguish one from the other. They're using language I'm not comfortable with, because I'm not seeing what… immediately seeing what I'm looking for. Veterans Readiness Survivor… Now I'm forced to focus in more, that doesn't make me happy. And I don't see what I'm looking for. I try to scroll… No, then I would click back, and… Healthcare… go through… oh, education, right there, duh! It's in blue already. Then I click continue… Then I look for work study, and I know it's at the bottom, I click that, don't read anything, click it, make sure it highlights, and then click continue. And then, what am I looking for here? A general question… And continue, again, not reading, and then… your attachment, I'm not gonna attach anything, because I'm… already submitted, and I'm looking for an answer. Then your attachment, no, okay. So, it's asking me for an attachment, now I'm frustrated. Now I'm pissed. So I would go to back. I'm a veteran, Continue… then I would check. did those… put that information in as the school, state of the school, the state I reside in, and click continue. Again, not caring that I haven't seen this data before, but I must have missed something, and I don't care, because I'm looking for an answer, not caring about the questions. I would skip right to continue on this screen, and then I'd look for my question, there it is. I don't care about any of this, and I would scroll down, and I would say, submit question. No, it's already… I already submitted it. So now I don't know what to do, so I'd immediately quick click submit question, because I'm just not happy.

Researcher: Can you talk through a little bit about how you're feeling at the end of this?

P13: I don't know what I'm doing or why I'm doing it, I thought I was trying to get a status.

Researcher: Bye.

P13: I'm a little confused now.

Researcher: Yeah, so we were kind of repeating the…

P13: Oh, the same process.

Researcher: Yeah, it was to kind of… if you… yeah, we kind of had to get back in that mental state again of…

P13: Yes, sorry.

Researcher: realized you had some work-study benefit questions. So for this process, on a scale from 1 to 5, how easy or difficult was it to complete this task? Again, 1 being very difficult, and 5 being very easy.

P13: Probably 5.

Researcher: Okay, and on a scale from 1 to 5, how satisfied were you with this process? 1 being very unsatisfied, and 5 being very satisfied. Can you explain that 4 a little bit more for me?

P13: Again, a little bit of frustration with the screens, not caring to read all the data. I'm trying to get through it, not… Pay attention to it.

Researcher: Okay. Is there anything in particular that you liked about the process?

P13: No. It seemed to be pretty much the same. I'm not surprised by anything I saw, except for my own confusion about what I was doing. So, yeah, we just continue on. I wouldn't give it another thought.

Researcher: Okay.

P13: Again, I'm looking for a solution, not a process.

Researcher: Yeah. No, I think that… that makes sense. We have one final task, so I'm going to go ahead and copy and paste this last link in here.

P13: Okay.

Researcher: And… again, kind of, you just submitted your first question, say, and it's been a little bit since you asked that question. You're coming back into AskVA to check on the status of your work-study benefits question. So go ahead and show us how you would check on that question here.

P13: Okay, now you said first question. I'm assuming you mean the last question I submitted.

Researcher: Yes, the, yeah, the question you just asked.

P13: I would immediately go to here, where it says Education, and look at the top to make sure it was Work Study. Only look at what I needed. There, I see Work Study. I would… you see that it's new, I would click View Details. I might scroll down, but I can't, so I just click View Details. And I wouldn't pay attention to anything else.

Researcher: And again, what attributes of the question that you asked are you looking for here?

P13: I'm not sure what you mean by attributes, but I'm… Again, I'm a… I'm… I'm assuming I'm… I'm dealing with status. I'm trying to find the answer to my question, not all… there's all kinds of options and relevant things here, or irrelevant things here, according to what I'm attempting to do. So I would shoot right to what I'm trying to get to, and I would find a way to get to it and get into it. It gets you killed.

Researcher: And what are some of the specific things that are feeling irrelevant to you here?

P13: Again, I have a screen full of information. I see there's many other options that presumably I entered… asked questions about, but I don't care about any of that, because I logged on to ask my work… to get a status of my work study question.

Researcher: Okay. And… what information is most important to you here?

P13: Seeing the new identifies, and then work study down here identifies what I'm looking for. View details seems to be the only option, because all this stuff up top. And all this stuff at the bottom is just minutiae related to the screen itself, not to me. So I'd go right to view details and click, because it's the only option I can see that seems relevant.

Researcher: Okay. Is there any other… Oops, sorry, go ahead.

P13: I'm not paying particular attention to the rest of the details on the screen.

Researcher: Okay. Is there any other information that you would like to see here?

P13: I would say no, if anything, less information, but what I would like to see is And I don't know how you're supposed to know this, but the last thing, the new clean… the new, section up here on top, I would like it to be bolder and bigger so I can find it faster.

Researcher: Okay. And I guess I'm curious, so you've talked about, like, the new status. What does that new status mean to you?

P13: The last one I submitted, N. I'm trying to find the current Where am I in that process? Like, am I done? Which is really what I'm looking… I don't really care about anything else.

Researcher: Okay. And what order are you seeing these items in?

P13: I'm assuming newest thing, last thing up front, or up top. I… I could look to verify that by looking at the date submitted, but again, or last updated, but I'm not… particularly paying any attention to that, unless I had to, she knew I'd go right to that without even paying attention.

Researcher: Okay.

P13: Which is why I want that section bigger.

Researcher: Gotcha.

P13: More relevant to me.

Researcher: Yeah, so you've mentioned that. Is there anything else that you didn't like about, viewing things this way?

P13: Again, I'm repeating the screen I see. All the blue up top is a waste of space. The ask VA and the verbiage underneath it, up to ask new question, is irrelevant to me. Including the Your Question section with those search boxes. The only thing that's important to me is the list, where it starts with category and down, and even the bottom section would need help. It's not. Pertinent to me. So I see it, I'm aware of it, and it's just in my way, visually and mentally.

Researcher: And is there anything in particular that you liked about this view?

P13: It's hierarchically ordered, so I know the new one is up top, which I am pleased to see, so I don't have to pay any… you know, I don't have to pay a lot of attention to the details within the list. I see new, I see a star, that's very relevant, I see view details, that's where I'd go.

Researcher: Okay. Great. Any other thoughts on… on this one?

P13: Just, you know, now that I'm looking at the screen, there's other information available to me if I needed it. For example, I have a reply on an earlier one, but right now, I don't care about that, because I'm relating to my work-study question. I also see there's Next button at the bottom, tab 1 and 2, so there's more information below, which frustrates me, because why can't it all be right here instead of all this other debris? you know.

Researcher: Okay. Great. Well, that was the last task. I do have… and I will go ahead and… I'm gonna keep the screen share, but I'm going to… oops. I think I will, yeah, I think I will try to… yeah. Stop remote control, so you should still, still be able to see my screen, is that correct?

P13: Yes, I do. It's the application, yep.

Researcher: Yeah, okay, so you experienced two different versions of Ask VA today. And I've got, kind of an image here to represent each one. The image on the left is the first experience you went through for submitting a question, and the one on the right is the second experience that you went through. And so I'm curious When it comes to submitting a question, which of these two versions did you prefer?

P13: The one on the right.

Researcher: The one on the right. This one.

P13: Though I didn't really realize before there was much difference.

Researcher: Okay. Yeah, can you expand then on your preference for that?

P13: Sure, the one on the right, even in this small print, the way it is with both images on the screen, I can easily see the yellow box that says 0% complete. That's very valuable to me. And here's a Your Question box, is relevant to me. The other one has a lot of what I'll call nonsense on it that I really have to pay attention to to get the details of of what information I need to input. to get where I want to go, because I don't want to be here on either one of these screens. I want to get…

Researcher: Okay. Thanks for providing some more context there. The second question is, we also had you look at a previous question, and so on the left is that first experience that you had, and on the right is the one we were just looking at. So which one did you prefer, for looking for a previous question?

P13: I much prefer the one on the right for a whole host of reasons.

Researcher: Okay, can you talk me through those a little bit?

P13: the hierarchically ordered questions down below, with the new one up top. On the one on the right is very valuable to me. I see the list of the ones underneath in some particular order by date, in this example, including status, which is easy to find, and I can go to details if I needed it. I have no use for the left screen at all.

Researcher: Okay. Now… If you could change anything else about the Ask VA experience, What would it be?

P13: Well… when you say anything else, I would reiterate what I was saying. For example, this right screen that I prefer. I really only prefer the bottom half of the right screen, the top half is just white noise.

Researcher: Yeah.

P13: So, if it had to be there for whatever reason, I'd like it to be much smaller and pushed up way up to the top. The bottom half should be two-thirds of the screen or more.

Researcher: Okay. Any other, kind of, final thoughts that you have about the experiences that you saw today?

P13: The only other comment I would make about it, and this is based on my using these VA… similar VA screens before is. I have the data, it's a lot of… information coming at me, I'm only looking for what I'm looking for, so I'm just trying to find that, and I see all this other white noise, but one of the things that adds to frustration for me when I go to these screens is upload time, and time after I click a link. To process that request. Whole thing should happen quicker. In the civilian world, it's a much more streamlined process.

Researcher: Okay. Yeah, so just, uploading things you're saying, like uploading documentation, and then.

P13: Yeah, when the screen comes up, it takes longer to load than I would expect in the civilian world.

Researcher: Gotcha.

P13: When I make a selection like View Details on a particular part of this screen on the right. I would expect a delay after I click View Detail.

Researcher: Gotcha. Okay. Oh, that's really good. That's really good feedback. That was the last set of questions that I had for us today, and because I know we're right about the 60-minute mark, I think, from when we joined, I want to be respectful of that time. I wanted to quickly circle back and reconfirm, now that we've gone through this session, whether or not you're comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session at all with our VA partners. We would remove any identifiable information, but it really helps to create improved experiences for VA.gov and just our digital experiences overall. So, I wanted to Get confirmation of whether or not you're comfortable with that.

P13: I'm perfectly comfortable with it, I don't even need names removed or anything. It's fine, you can say who I am and what I… my comments were and why, because that's important. The user experience is important, otherwise the whole thing's irrelevant. In mine.

Researcher: Yeah. Well, thank you so much for that, and just thank you so much for your time today. I really appreciate all of the honest and open feedback that you gave us. You gave us some really great, insights about your experience, and just, like, your previous experience and how you bring it to interacting with some newer VA tools. Last thing I wanted to mention was, Paragian, they'll be sending you a thank you note, and it has a little blurb if you would be willing to pass that along to other veterans in your life that might be interested in participating in research like this, just so that we can continue to talk to folks like yourselves, and continue improving VA.gov and those digital experiences for veterans like yourself.

P13: So I could, like… you're saying I could email that link to other veterans I know?

Researcher: Yeah, exactly.

P13: Absolutely, because this is how it's better in the process. That's why I was excited about getting involved in this.

Researcher: Well, we are so excited to have you today, Brennan. I really appreciate, all of your time. I guess before we close out, though, I'll just ask, do you have any additional questions for me?

P13: No, I don't, thank you.

Researcher: Alright, well, I hope you have a really great day. We'll talk. Talk to you later. Bye. Thank you.
