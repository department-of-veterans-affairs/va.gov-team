Researcher: Okay. So, now that I have started the recording, I would like you to go ahead and confirm one more time that you're okay with recording this session.

P3: Yes, that's fine.

Researcher: Okay. Awesome. Well, thank you for, kind of, letting me walk through all of those expectations. Before we jump into a couple of warm-up questions, I would love to, see if you had any questions first.

P3: No, I'm good to go.

Researcher: Okay. Awesome. Alright, so in the initial survey, you indicated that you've used VA's education or training benefits. Can you tell me a little bit more about how you're currently using those benefits?

P3: Currently, well, I've used a GI… Montgomery GI Bill and the post-9-11. in the past, currently, two things. I was… I was, going through the whole VR&E process and got ex… got that going, but I didn't get my, Oh, what do you call it? They didn't… they didn't get me into a program. So, right now, all's I'm doing is, like, the Red Skill thing. I've, requested that, and now I'm waiting to hear back so I can get back in. And use the rest of my benefits.

Researcher: Okay. Have you experienced… oh, sorry, go ahead.

P3: No, they said it could take some time. It could take up, you know, to a year, I guess, I don't know, but hopefully not.

Researcher: Yeah, my next question was going to be if you've experienced any challenges related to receiving these education or training benefits.

P3: Yeah, The 9-11 and the Montgomery, that was all good to go, that was smooth, until I ran out of that. And then, the VR&E has been… I don't know if you're part of that? Is that connected?

Researcher: Yeah, I would love to hear about your experiences.

P3: It's horrible. It's absolutely horrible. Because, you know, I submit everything they request, and then they'll say, requested again, it was, I think. Personally, I think it's the counselor, but… It was just… it seemed like they were finding excuses to keep pushing it and pushing it. They asked me for more information, more information, could I do this again? Could I redo this? And I did everything he did, and finally they said, well, we're gonna, you know, basically kick you out of the program because you didn't submit this. I said, I did submit it, like, 3 times, and… You know, it wasn't what they wanted, it wasn't, you know, quite to exactly their standards, and everything was on Zoom, so I couldn't just walk in and, you know, have a sit-down and see, what do you really want me to do? It was very, very frustrating, so that whole thing's messed up. I've tried to get into it twice. I did it once before. And then, so, that didn't go, and I resubmitted and started the whole process again, and it takes, like… You know what Mike takes? I don't know. 6 months to whatever, however long it takes before you can even get a meeting with them. And then the whole process, and it just… it was very frustrating. I'll try it again, but actually, I wanted to actually, do one of the, file one of the, -Oh. Denial things, or whatever. Flames? see if I can just… Absolutely don't want to go to the same counselor, because that was… seemed to be the problem.

Researcher: Okay. So, have you contacted VA for any kind of support for any of these challenges? Maybe specifically in the last, like, 6 months to a year?

P3: Yeah, this has been pretty recent. So it's too hard.

Researcher: How did you go about contacting support?

P3: Boom. F-the-phone… over the phone.

Researcher: Okay. Now, have you ever used a tool called AskVA?

P3: I believe so. Okay. I'm not sure, so I'm not… not sure. I'd have to go into… If it's in the e… if it shows up on eBenefits, it's possible, but I'm not sure.

Researcher: Okay. Okay. Well, thank you for just describing some of the experiences that you've had, related to these, kind of, education and training benefits. It's really good to understand, kind of, where you're coming from, as we continue to talk through, through the support tool. So, I'm going to, at this point, move us into the next part of this test session, and I'm going to be walking you through some different scenarios and tasks. So, I wanted to start by having you share your screen with us, and so that should be, at the bottom of the Zoom window, a green square with an arrow inside of it.

P3: Got it.

Researcher: And so, yeah, you can… if you can share your screen with us, then I will be sending you, in the chat. Some login information. So, I've sent you a link, and an email address, and a password. So you'll need to log in through id.me. And then I'll kind of prompt you with a scenario to… to move forward. So I see your screen. Are you able to get the link from the Zoom chat?

P3: I don't even see the Zoom chat anymore. Show meeting, there we go. Maybe… I don't see it.

Researcher: Yeah, I think at the top of the window, there should be something that says chat. Maybe at the top or the bottom, actually.

P3: Yeah, okay. There's a chat right there. Okay.

Researcher: Yeah, if you see that, then it should pop up, like, on the right, And, yeah, I've copied… if you can copy the link, Into your browser, perfect. Is that it? Yep. And then I've provided a test email address, so if you're able to copy that, to, like, by logging in here.

P3: I'd like to chat. We'll tell him it'd be quiet. It's not letting me code and paste. No time. I told it before.

Researcher: You're not able to cut and paste it?

P3: You know, I'm trying.

Researcher: Send that one by itself, if you can…

P3: I'll just write it down.

Researcher: Okay.

P3: See you now. Go tell them to be quiet in there. Lord. Yeah, this is gonna be difficult. Okay, now I gotta get back to the other window. Where do you want me to put the, for login?

Researcher: If you scroll…

P3: to sign in.

Researcher: Yeah, you can sign in there.

P3: I'm having pop-ups, this is wrong with your head. Oh, my girl. I'm gonna find… Thank you, who?

Researcher: Yeah, so if you log in through ID.me, yep.

P3: Mine's already set up to be, like… You know, I just click on it, it already has my information. I'm gonna paste… Password…

Researcher: Yeah, and you should just be able to kind of click through the remainder of the login to get us to, I think if you scroll down, you should be able to kind of just continue through.

P3: Okay. This ain't gonna mess up my other ID.me, is it?

Researcher: No, it isn't.

P3: Like that.

Researcher: Alright, so I'm gonna go ahead and kind of give you the scenario once you're fully logged in here. So, I want you to imagine that you're having an issue with your work-study benefits. You've been directed to ask VA to get help with your issue. Before you click on anything to complete this task, take a second to look around and talk out loud about what it is that you're seeing here.

P3: First of all, I can confirm I've not used SVA. And how did we get to this in the first place? Because it's not going to come up when I just log in to… e-benefits or whatever. So, this… this isn't, like, the first screen I'm gonna see when I log in. Okay, VA.gov.

Researcher: So talk out loud about, kind of what you're reading and what you're seeing here.

P3: Yeah, I've never made it to this… this page. So, I've been to this page, the homepage… I've never filled out nothing here, because normally, like, if I have a question, I'll try to, Asked directly to, like, the, maybe the education, I'll call that number.

Researcher: Hmm.

P3: to talk to them, but I've never used this right here. Okay. And is this for all types of questions, like medical benefits and… Or is this just… For certain lawns. I guess it could be. It seems like a more generalized, page.

Researcher: Yeah, what.

P3: And then probably…

Researcher: from SBA so far.

P3: Yeah, well, I would assume if I ask them a question, they're gonna redirect me to somebody else. Okay. Because it seems like a more generalized page. They're not going to have the answer, so they're going to say, okay, contact. Your educational, whatever, or you contact, you know, The clinic, or whatever.

Researcher: Okay. Now, show us how you would use FBA to get help.

P3: Alright. It's like… it says I have a form to fill out. Right here. It's…

Researcher: Remember to talk me through, kind of, what you're seeing, and as you're seeing it.

P3: I guess my personal information will show up automatically. And I'm gonna continue… And figure out what I want to ask. Category Say, educational benefits, continue. I'm gonna look for whatever my question's about. See if I can find anything that'll match up to it. Let's do this one, since I was talking about it. Chapter 31. Continue. You could accidentally, maybe, I would think. That's where I've ran into problems, and it seems like I'm going in a big ol' loop. is I'll ask… I'll go into the… It'll just say, educational benefits. I clicked on it, but it won't be the right one. That one's more specific, which is good. It had a lot more narrower, Fields that you can select from. to direct you into the more specific areas, whereas before, when I would ask a question, I'd be like… and I wouldn't find what I'm looking for. So I like that.

Researcher: How important do you see those previous two questions as?

P3: Say that one more time?

Researcher: How important do you think those two lists that you were just looking for… looking through? Extremely important. Extremely important, because it might just say.

P3: educational benefits, click on it, but then it's going to take you to, like, Montgomery GI Bill or 9-11. It's not gonna break it down as far as you guys did right there. That's way better. than I've seen in the past.

Researcher: Okay. And what would you do if you couldn't find an option that fit your needs?

P3: is frustrating. Sometimes I give up. sometimes I'll keep going through the rabbit hole, looking, okay, let's just do education benefits, it takes me to this, it takes me to this, and after a while, you're like, you know what, forget it, or I'll maybe call the… just call the… Call the number, you know? Try to get from there, but…

Researcher: Okay.

P3: Okay, this question's about myself… Good to know. I'd have to go back to my email. But…

Researcher: Yeah, in this case, we can just go ahead and kind of write test. This is not the live system, so…

P3: That was another problem. I was trying to find the name of my… I remember that, too. They weren't…

Researcher: Hmm.

P3: I had to really search to find the name of my… so somebody else asked me that question. And sometimes it just says, I thought Eva was her name, and it was E-V-A. It was the email address, which is horrible, but…

Researcher: Hmm.

P3: So, because EVA was part of the email address that I was sending all my information into, so I assumed her name was Eve.

Researcher: Oh, interesting.

P3: It's like, okay, that's EVA.

Researcher: So, feel free to type in any question that you might have here.

P3: Well… True. I don't even know what to say, because I was just very frustrated. I… the main question is, if I resubmit. And it's gonna direct me to the Phoenix office, am I gonna get the same counselor? Because I don't want the same counselor, I don't know if they have multiple ones.

Researcher: Okay.

P3: And if so, then it's basically not worth my time to do it. I would rather submit a, whatchamacallit, rebuttal or whatever, to the one I already did.

Researcher: Okay. So, on this page in particular, I'm curious how you might kind of differentiate what you would put in the subject versus what you might want to put in the question.

P3: Well, the subject is… What… whatever topic you're concerned about. it might be Montgomery GI Bill, it might be Chapter 31, it might be a health question, I guess. I guess you can… you know, we'll go back to that first… that second page. where I selected the, the subject, and you'll put that in there, basically, and then go from there.

Researcher: Okay. And can you describe a time where you might want to attach something to a question like this?

P3: Yeah, definitely. I could attach the emails that we were… possibly going through the whole spill with, and show them, hey, this is what I was going through. But your thousand character… well, it depends on the file size. Hopefully, 25 megs is enough. It probably won't be. So there's a problem right there.

Researcher: Okay.

P3: We're talking about gigs.

Researcher: You would want to attach, like, that… that much information.

P3: Some files are hard to condense. So…

Researcher: Okay. So I'll have you kind of continue on the process of,

P3: Okay.

Researcher: Asking a question here.

P3: Custom. Thank you. That seems good.

Researcher: So, on a scale from 1 to 5, how easy or difficult was it for you to complete this task?

P3: Which is… oh, it was easy.

Researcher: 1 is very difficult, and 5 is very easy.

P3: Maybe 4.

Researcher: Okay. Can you expand on that at all?

P3: No, I felt it was fairly easy, I don't… let's see… felt like I had any hang-ups. I guess maybe the main thing was just getting to this page in the first place, because I wouldn't… I've known where to go, like, just off the top of my head, if somebody asked me, I wouldn't have… I wouldn't have known until today.

Researcher: Okay.

P3: to go to this SBA thing. Good.

Researcher: So on a scale from 1 to 5, how satisfied were you with this process? 1 being very unsatisfied, and 5 being very satisfied.

P3: I would say 5. I liked… The detailed, drop-down box on it, with all the different, areas I could go to.

Researcher: Okay.

P3: The real question is. how… how quick of a response… how beneficial will it be? Will I get re… you know, re… you know, sent to some other… somebody else, or will they answer the question themselves? Or will they find the question out and answer it, and return me, you know… this could go for anything, basically. Are they gonna do the research? Or does this get directed? I guess I should ask this. Does this get directed… To one central location, or does it go out to the various, You know, agencies, or whatever, that will answer the question yourselves.

Researcher: Yeah, what would you expect AskVA to do next?

P3: In the past, I would expect a generalized answer, and I'll say, please contact your local whatever you know, your regional educational officer or counselor, I'd be like, that's why I'm asking you in the first place, you know? But hopefully now, no, hopefully they can give me a better answer.

Researcher: And how long would you expect, it take to get a response?

P3: what I expect, or would I want? That's two different questions. I would like it within a week.

Researcher: P.

P3: You know, that seems reasonable to me. Would I expect it? No, probably within… 180 days?

Researcher: Okay.

P3: I'm just being honest, that's how it seems to be in the past, so…

Researcher: Yeah, no, I really appreciate your… your honesty on, kind of, your expectations and based on your experiences in the past. So, I'm gonna go ahead and move us on to our second task. So if you're able to get back to Zoom, I have pasted, a new, email address in… In the chat again, I'm actually gonna have you log off, or log out of the previous account that you were in, and we're gonna look at it a little bit differently this time.

P3: Okay, so this one right here? This link?

Researcher: I cannot see the.

P3: Okay.

Researcher: But yeah, it's, it should be, like, the last email that I sent you, It's the number 220, isn't it?

P3: Yeah. Got it. And then the password's… Fitness. T-M… Sweet.

Researcher: Alright, yeah, so I'll have you, scroll down, or yeah, sign in again. Kind of the same thing that we did before, with that new email address and new password.

P3: If it worked.

Researcher: Yeah, that should be… Correct, but…

P3: Legion.

Researcher: Let's try it one more time. I will say we have had some issues with these passwords lately.

P3: Let me try… maybe the VA's not capitalized, or the…

Researcher: Yeah, it should be… the A is capitalized, and then the VA should be capitalized, and the T should be capitalized.

P3: The VA step lives. Both V and A.

Researcher: Yes.

P3: That's right. Hmm.

Researcher: Okay, with that being the case, then I think I will have us go ahead and go back to the previous, the previous login information, and we'll just use that login information again. Sorry about that.

P3: Let me move this out.

Researcher: Yeah, and actually, well, it looked like it was logged in there for a second, but yeah, we'll go ahead and log in again. Beautify. Hmm.

P3: Let's see what…

Researcher: It looks like neither of them are working.

P3: 140SS…

Researcher: Yeah, that's the right one.

P3: Yeah, because I was able to just log in as well, and…

Researcher: It was able to… Work… There, I wonder if maybe… I think the option for us here might be… I'll go ahead and log in, and try and give you control of, of my screen.

P3: Did I go to the zoom, then?

Researcher: Yeah, let's go ahead and make sure I got this. Logged in. Okay, yeah, so let me… Let's see if I… so I'll share my screen. Okay. Okay, and… I'm gonna give you mouse control. Which I think… Good work here. Let's see… Can you see the AskVA tool?

P3: Yeah, this is so small that it's hard to read.

Researcher: Okay.

P3: Just one second. If you can blow it up at all.

Researcher: Okay. Okay, so you should have… control of my screen. I'm increasing the size a little bit. Can you try using your mouse to control my screen, see if that worked?

P3: Dude, fucking…

Researcher: Okay, great, so you should be able to kind of scroll in there, and… I might take it back a little bit, because I'll have to kind of… can you see my whole screen, or can you only see…

P3: Yeah, I could… I could see from ASVA down to, submitted…

Researcher: question. Okay.

P3: Yeah.

Researcher: Okay, great. I'm gonna pull the… the mouse for here for just a second, trying to… Two things on multiple screens now. Okay, so I wanted you to imagine it's been a few months since you submitted that question, and you may have submitted other questions through SBA since then. Show me how you would go back to check on that question.

P3: Hmm… Let's see, what's filtered by status? Hi. In progress. Possibly. And maybe if I… Looking for the educational benefits, how you pull that up. And then apply the filters. Let's see what comes up. And if that's the one I want… I can't pull it down, though. Filting, listening.

Researcher: Sorry.

P3: There we go. Check, see if that's the same question…

Researcher: So, what… what parts of your previous question are you looking for when you would want to come back and… review it.

P3: I'm basically seeing if I have a result, if they've answered my question.

Researcher: And what information is most important from what you can see here?

P3: what's the importance of the question? He's trying to find out when he's gonna get his compensation. Right now, he's just waiting. He's waiting on an answer.

Researcher: Yeah, is there anything else that would be helpful for you in finding a previous question, or finding information about a previous question?

P3: Yeah, you can go up here. Looks like… Change the filters…

Researcher: Okay, and what do those filters mean to you? How did those work for you?

P3: in progress is something I've asked, and it hasn't been, I don't know. That's kind of… I don't exactly know what they mean. replied by me, or replied by an answer from somebody else, I don't know.

Researcher: fun.

P3: reopened? Is that something that I've asked before and didn't get an answer for, and I wanted another answer? I'm not sure. It's not very, This is… this is good, this is self-explanatory. It's telling you exactly what you was asking… what the question was about. As far as… I don't know what reopen means. Is it a case closed? Because this doesn't seem to be a case, it's just a question. it almost like… I'd almost rather see it in a form like, You know how on your email, and you have an email chain? like that, so if I… if I go and click on that question. I can see anything that's ever happened with that question.

Researcher: Okay.

P3: And maybe see, like, down here, it might… it might have to be, like, the, Something you click on… oh, there we go, view conversation.

Researcher: And I think for the sake of time, I am gonna kind of move us along, from… from, kind of, just got your initial feedback on… on that page, which was great. So I am gonna go ahead and move us on. I'm gonna stop sharing my screen. Okay. But that was… that was super helpful to understand your perspective, seeing that. What I wanted to let you know is we are going to be doing really similar tasks in a slightly different system. So some things may look similar, while other things are completely different. We're really trying to understand your, your experience in both. So, what I'm going to do now, these links we should hopefully have a lot less issues with, So I am going to provide you a new link, and I'll have you share your screen with me again, and then I'll provide… I'll have this link in the Zoom chat, so similar to what we did Previously. And then I'll… once you can get into that link and your screen shared, then I'll go ahead and give you the… the prompt again.

P3: I'm not sure which one I'm… The very last one?

Researcher: Yeah, the very last link is what you should click on, and then once you bring that up, then I'll have you, go ahead and share your screen again in Zoom. So, that green button at the bottom of the Zoom window.

P3: It's still trying to get in there.

Researcher: Okay.

P3: It's not… What happened to mine? I'm not seeing a… Great. I've lost the, zoom, there we go. Sure.

Researcher: Alright, it looks like the screen share… yep, great. So I see… yeah, the Ask VA screen. Okay. So, similar to what we did before, imagine you're having an issue with your work-study benefits, and you've been directed here to get help with that issue. Show us again how you would use AskVA to get help.

P3: Okay, I can't scroll down. There we go. Sorry.

Researcher: Oh, no problem.

P3: Boom. You said work studying?

Researcher: listening.

P3: Question… This one doesn't have the… Unless I missed it.

Researcher: Yeah, so in this version, you can't necessarily type in yourself, so we've kind of pre-populated information, but just kind of want to see how you walk through this, and… So talk to me out loud about what you're thinking.

P3: I asked my question, now I gotta find a… Bird study… Oh, now I'm looking for why I… I guess pay… oh, there it is, works stealing. Oh my goodness. There we go. I believe it's time card, right? I believe it was time card, I don't know. Nope, just not. Okay. Don't know… possibly they want to… you know, I'd probably put a, Attach a photo of my time… time card.

Researcher: Okay.

P3: If that's the right… I couldn't tell you if that's the right file. Yes, it matters, because it's not letting me work. Number name… They'll review all the, everything. Assume everything looks good, or doesn't. Everything looks good, submit question. Guess what's it.

Researcher: Okay. So… On a scale from 1 to 5, how easy or difficult was it to complete this task? 1 being very difficult, and 5 being very easy.

P3: I wasn't hard, I would say… 5. It was easy.

Researcher: Okay. And on a scale from 1 to 5, how satisfied were you with this process? 1 being very unsatisfied, and 5 being very satisfied.

P3: With this process, I would say 5.

Researcher: Okay. Can you expand a little bit more on… I'm giving this a 5 for both.

P3: It was really simple, I didn't have no problems, finding what I needed, basically.

Researcher: Okay. Is there anything in particular that you liked about this process?

P3: No, just in general, it was streamlined, it seemed… Pretty simple.

Researcher: Okay. Was there anything in particular that you didn't like?

P3: Going back to the original, I would say I wouldn't know where to find it in the first place.

Researcher: Okay. Alright, so we've got one last task, to walk through, so I'm gonna provide one last link in… the chat for Zoom.

P3: Did I X out of this one, or no?

Researcher: I can't see… Zoom kind of doesn't show me anything in Zoom that you're seeing, so it should just be the last link that I sent.

P3: Okay. We're still screen sharing?

Researcher: Yes, I can see your screen. Okay, great. Okay. So, again, imagine it's been a few months since you submitted this question, and now you're back to kind of find out more information about that specific question about your work-study benefits. Show me how you would check on that previously asked question here.

P3: Mmm… Search… Type in work study. I guess. It's not letting me do it. It's not gonna let me do it. Filter by…

Researcher: Yeah, so talk me through, kind of, how you would want to use some of those things.

P3: If I didn't see it, like, let's just say it was 10 questions down, I'd put in the search, but it's not letting me do it, so… Since it's right here on the top, a few details. And I see there's a question, there's the attachments that I sent, probably… Time cards. Inbox, here's my responses right there. Let's take a look at them. I'm sure about me. That was the same day I sent it, so it was probably just saying, hey, we received this, and then this is probably the actual answer.

Researcher: Okay. And…

P3: Oh, the…

Researcher: Thank you.

P3: I guess this is it right here.

Researcher: And if you go back to the previous page, And I think you should just hit the back… be able to hit the back button in the browser. Yeah. So, is there any information that you think would be helpful to see here in order to find a previous response?

P3: Well, actually, the search would be… that search, you could just… Typed in, work study, or… 9-11, or, you know, whatever. You're looking for if it pulls up, and then right here, too, by filters and category. Then hit apply, then it should jump it to the top.

Researcher: Okay. Maybe, maybe, I don't know, sometimes, I've seen where earlier you put in a,

P3: like, a response number or file number, maybe you could enter that in off of an email you get or something, but…

Researcher: Hmm.

P3: This seems to be sufficient.

Researcher: And what order are you seeing these questions in?

P3: From latest to oldest.

Researcher: And what order would you want to see these in?

P3: Latest to oldest. Just like it is.

Researcher: Okay. Okay. Is there anything else about, kind of reviewing a previous question that you especially liked or didn't like?

P3: No, I'm just trying to think of my personal… this kind of bring up… brought up something that I was trying to find myself before, and… it just wasn't there. I don't know what to do about that, like… It was a couple years ago. I'm trying to find a response to something, and I don't know if it just didn't get… we didn't get… I didn't get a response? Possibly? So, I don't know. you know, I was going through the kind of similar thing, looking… doing a search on something I tried to submit a claim on. So did they not receive the claim? Did they not act on it? You know, so I don't know what to do about, I don't know if there's anything you can do.

Researcher: Okay.

P3: It just wasn't there.

Researcher: Yeah. Well, that wraps up. Oh, sorry, go ahead.

P3: I just feel like maybe I was in the wrong, This might be an issue. Say, say I asked it on this ask… ask, what is it called? Ask? What's the system called? AskVA?

Researcher: Let's say I asked it in a different…

P3: a different area, so it wouldn't appear here, so I'm over here looking for it, and it's over here on this other you know… E-benefits or something. If they're not… if they're not talking, it's gonna be… it's gonna be kind of hard. It's gonna be confusing. Where did I submit that? Where did I ask that question?

Researcher: Yeah. Well, that was our last task, and I kind of wanted to just wrap up really quick, with kind of one final couple of… or a couple of final questions, I guess, and I am going to share with you really quick, so I'll take over the screen share again. And so, you should be able to see my screen right now, is that correct?

P3: Yeah.

Researcher: Okay, so you got to experience two different versions of AskVA today. The one on the left kind of represents your first experience, kind of going through and asking a question, and the second one represents the second experience that you just had going through and asking a question. And I would love to understand, which one you preferred to submit a question. That first experience you had, or the second one?

P3: It's funny, because I said 5 out of 5 on the second one, 4 out of 5 on the first one. I prefer the first one. I like the, the detailed drop-down box with all the information in it. It's, it's, you know… I think it narrows… it… it really helps… Seeing that you're getting directed to the right place.

Researcher: term. And a similar question, kind of our second set of tasks in each place was to review a previous question. So again, we've got kind of a representation on the left of The first experience you had and, the representation on the right is that last experience we were just looking at, and so I would love to understand which of these two you preferred to review a previous question.

P3: I guess I like them both for two different reasons. I like the second one because it's in chronological order. the questions, but over here, I get more information. On the first one. And I like that.

Researcher: Can you talk a little bit more about what information, you're seeing more of on the left-hand side versus the right?

P3: Yeah, I can't… I can't really read it, because it's too small, but… just remembering it.

Researcher: for you a little bit.

P3: There we go. You can actually see the question? And then you can re- review the conversation below it.

Researcher: Okay.

P3: I guess the simple fact that you see the question right there.

Researcher: So if you had to choose one over the other, I know you talked about the things you liked and didn't like of both.

P3: I'll go with the first one.

Researcher: The first one, so this one.

P3: The second one reminds me of how it is kind of now in the eBenefits.

Researcher: Okay. Okay. And I guess just to kind of close us out, that was really the last question, so I'll go ahead and… stop sharing my screen then. I did… I did want to circle back and reconfirm, now that we've kind of gone through this whole thing, I wanted to make sure that you would still be comfortable with sharing potentially a video clip of this session, with our VA partners as we report out on this research. we would remove all information that would identify you, but the potential audio or video could be shared with folks internally, and so I just wanted to make sure that that is something comfortable with.

P3: That's fine.

Researcher: Okay. Well… Thank you so much, Bradley, for taking the time, and kind of working through these different tasks with us. Your input was extremely valuable to understand your perspective, and really understand how we can make this tool better for folks like yourself. So, lastly, Perigian is kind of the person that… the group that recruited you, and they'll be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other veterans, to let them know you can… they can also participate in research like this. So… just wanted to give you a heads up on that. And yeah, before I officially closed this out, just wanted to see if you had any questions for me.

P3: Questions, I appreciate it. I actually shared it with my buddy William Frazier, he'll be on here soon. Give him a hard time for me, okay?

Researcher: Alright, I'll.

P3: Make it really difficult for them.

Researcher: Awesome. Well, thank you so much for that. We really appreciate your feedback. Have a great day.

P3: Thank you, you too.

Researcher: Alright, bye.
