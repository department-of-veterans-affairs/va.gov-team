Researcher: Okay, so you should have just heard that we've started recording, and so I am going to ask you one more time, now that we are recording, are you comfortable with us recording this session today? Okay. Great. Well, before we dig into just a couple kind of warm-up questions, I would… wanted to open it back to you to see if you had any questions before we got started.

P9: Oh, I think this is important. So I have a career in IT, and I've overseen a lot of testing, US capabilities, I know the value. I definitely have opinions, you know, on a lot of stuff that the VA does, so this is a great opportunity to, you know, hopefully make a difference. Thank you.

Researcher: Awesome. Well, we are so happy to have you here. So before we kind of dig into any of those tools that we talked about, in the initial survey, you indicated that you've used VA's education or training benefits. Can you tell me more about how you've used those benefits?

P9: Yeah, so I had, vocational rehab, I had other, educational assistants from the VA. And so, of late, I checked this year to see if there have been any changes. One of the things that happens at the VA, and I promise to try to keep these shorter. There's a lot of change happening at the VA all the time. I mean, in Congress, the laws. And so it's really hard to keep up with that. So, you know, I go in there, I hear there's a new change in educational benefits, I log in to see if there had been anything Afforded to me, and of course, it wasn't my, vocational rehab, what's it, Title 30? 20? I forget. Had expired. I've used them twice, you know, so I really, appreciated the VA educational benefits. That's what I did to kind of stay in tune. I read a lot, I read the news every day, but it's easier sometimes to just log in and see, hey, what the change is. So that's what I did last time.

Researcher: Okay, and have you experienced any challenges receiving the, like, the vocational benefits or any other educational benefits you've leveraged?

P9: Oh, yes, every time. I mean, it's been always very difficult. There's something wrong with how the VA puts out information. It's still a problem today. they will put out the information that is coming, and then it says, click on this link, you go to this link, and the link takes you back to another page, and it says, you know, you gotta call this number. You call the number, then they tell you you gotta go to the page. I said, but I did, I went to the page, and it seems like from beginning to end, and by the way, I've written about this to my congressman. and to the VA every time it happens, but it's never been an easy process. Even when I had the benefits, it was always, like, you had to… follow the game, run the crazy loops, and then end up calling your counselor to go, can you help me out? And then they do something, work it out. So, I don't know why that happens, but every time… it's like other benefit areas that the VA has worked on in the last year. has been the same process. I'll stop there, I can give you more details, but Yeah, I think there's something wrong. What's missing is this, what you guys are doing, which is end-to-end testing If all the pieces are there. And then when you get to bureaucrats, they go, well, that part belongs to somebody else, and we have no say over it. Or the counselor, or the doctors. And so, that's something that's bigger at the macro level. I actually wrote to President Trump about it. I volunteered to be on a veterans committee. to deal with this kind of stuff. So, I like what you guys are doing, because Anyway, I'll stop there. If you want more details, I can give you examples. I have emails, I have a lot of documentation, so…

Researcher: Yeah, I was gonna go a little deeper on that. Maybe… maybe in the last, like, 6 months, I wonder if you can, kind of walk me through the experience you might have had contacting VA for any kind of support, so not even just education. If there was anything in the last, like, 6 months or so, can you kind of walk me through what that experience was like for you?

P9: Yeah. So, in the last 6 months, I had, pursued, there was, there was… one of the newsletters from the VA said, hey, there's been a change, and the VA is now funding more certifications, training, and certifications. I was laid off this year, so I've been doing a lot of school. I get more assistance from New York State than I do from the VA. They pay for my schooling. The VA doesn't. So, that's great. They put out this thing to everybody, all veterans. Hey, there's new money for, certifications. So I go in there, I register, I wait, I get an email, I don't know, maybe a week or so later, saying that, yeah, unfortunately, you don't qualify for this. So that was my last, interaction, in the last few months, probably Within the last 6 months, so…

Researcher: Okay.

P9: And did you do anything after that email you received, or…

Researcher: You kind of stopped there.

P9: Oh, it just expressed frustration, and then I went to New York, and they approved me. They paid.

Researcher: for itself.

P9: So, New York State. I'm 100% funded by New York State. I get zero from the VA. It's always been like that. The VA's always been difficult. They offer you something, and then there's some rule where you can't get all of it. You know, the GI Bill has been a… I'll stop there, because, I mean, I have a lot of attitude towards, how, educational funding And programs are run. I went through the… what was the name of that program? I got approved onto it this year. For having served in the Gulf War and exposure and all that. Gosh, that took… it took more than a year to get it through, finally get accepted, and at the end it says, you know, you could end up qualifying for a higher disability rating. They denied it. Even though I got approved and said, you got exposure. And then I applied for educational benefits through that as well, and I said, no, you didn't qualify. But I go, but I got qualified for the exposure program. It meant nothing. All the testing, all the labs, all the… just to be told what I already knew, that I had been exposed, but got nothing for it. And to me, it's all about education. All my kids are highly educated. My daughters, each in their mid-30s, have 6 college degrees and PhDs. So I'm always an advocate for that, and I'm still staying in school. That'll keep me, hopefully, alive past 100. So education, to me, is the most important benefit, that… that I can get. And the VA is not… you know, they helped me through master certification and previous programs, and I get it that, You… you can't offer a veteran lifelong education, but let's face it, in this day and age, you know, 66,000 IT people got laid off in the New York City area, just in the last year. You know, and it's not… they say it's not because of AI, but there's more of that coming, so we have to retool ourselves to be able to be, you know, make a living and be effective in our society. Sorry for the long-winded speech.

Researcher: I appreciate just understanding, kind of, your context and, like, your mindset of where you're coming from. It's really helpful for us to understand that as we move forward in some of this stuff, so…

P9: I want to add that I'm a volunteer with Disabled American Veterans. And I purposely seek out other veterans to help, and there's nothing more frustrating to me when I finally encourage them. And Marines are the hardest for some reason. All my Marine buddies, friends, and stuff, they don't want to go through the VA, and then I help them through the whole process. And what do they get for it? Because what they're seeking is also education, you know? And it's tough, especially now.

Researcher: Yeah, well, I appreciate you kind of just sharing all of those different experiences. I had one more question before we kind of started looking at, some of these demo tools. Have you ever used a tool called AskVA?

P9: Yes.

Researcher: Okay, can you describe maybe your most recent experience with it?

P9: I use every tool, again, because I am a volunteer, and I like to be an expert on the VAs, because I help other veterans.

Researcher: Put in their claims.

P9: I've helped quite a… I have a lot of good stories. A Vietnam vet that only served 2 years, was exposed, had cancer, everybody in his family died. And he said, I don't want… I don't need any VA. Today, he's 100% disabled and getting support. So I point them to these tools, and I used… I can't remember what I used it for, but I did, asking for, and I can look through my notes and see, but… Yeah, I've seen that, so… It was very well advertised in the newsletters and emails, and I know I checked it out and used it, so…

Researcher: Okay.

P9: If you show it to me, I'll probably remember what it was about that I had tested it for.

Researcher: Okay. Awesome. So we're gonna move in, and again, I apologize, my dogs are barking. We're gonna move into the next part of our session, and I'm gonna be providing you with some different scenarios and tasks, but I first wanted to start by having you share your screen with us. So, you should be able to do that with the green share button at the bottom of the Zoom window.

P9: I'm colorblind, so you said there's a green… oh, there it is.

Researcher: Yeah, it's like a… yeah, it's a square with an arrow, you know.

P9: Yeah, I see it.

Researcher: Okay, great. And then I'm gonna be sharing a link in our Zoom chat that, if you can open up that link in a browser, Then that's where… that's where we'll kind of begin.

P9: Where's the link?

Researcher: It should be in the Zoom chat.

P9: Oh, there it is.

Researcher: And it should. Either you can copy and paste it into a browser, or if you click on it, it should open in, like, whatever default browser you have.

P9: I have 6 browsers, three computer screens, about to drag stuff over.

Researcher: Okay, great, I can.

P9: Do you see it?

Researcher: your screen. Yes. Okay, so I'm going to kind of walk you through a scenario then. So imagine that you've already logged into your VA.gov account, and you're having an issue with your work-study benefits. You've been directed to ask VA to get help with your issue. Before you click on anything to complete this task, take a second to look around and talk out loud about what it is you're seeing.

P9: Yeah, I definitely used, this, portal. Before. So it's nice and clean, well laid out. One of the criticisms I have of other VA portals is they have too much. And, I… I help some veterans that have some, you know, difficulty, with interacting with their environment, you know, for… because of medication or whatever. And so I really like, enjoy, I like this, site very much. Easy to lay out, so…

Researcher: And what are your expectations from AskVA so far?

P9: Well, you know, expectations, that's tough, but I'll tell you what my expectations are. I work a lot with AI, with other portals and other agencies, different entities, and I like where that stuff is going, you know? So I expect the SBA to get me to the right information, in a… in an easy way. I don't want 100 returns, I don't want… You know, a book of text covering every legality and possibility. it's important, not only out of respect for people's time, but I always like to point out that there's some veterans that cannot read, and they don't have the patience or time to really digest a lot of information, so they'll ask me. And I said, did you go here? And so I've been turning people… I remember this to one of my veteran's friends, he's a Marine, actually, to use his portal. Anyway, my expectation is to be able to get to the, the right information, Without having to sort through a lot of different, things.

Researcher: Hmm.

P9: Does that make sense?

Researcher: Yeah, and how long would you take… would you expect it to take to get help through AskVA?

P9: I have high expectations. I read a lot of books. There's one on web architecting. If you can't get it done within 3 clicks or less than 2 minutes. it's not functional. So I have high expectations. I expect it to be very quick and easy. And I'm seeing that happening with AI and other services that are amazing. I'm not even finished typing. I hit send, and the answer is already coming up. I'm sure you've seen that as well. Oh, I don't know, but…

Researcher: Well, thank you for providing some context on what you're seeing here. Now, could you show us how you would use AskVA to get help with your work-study benefits?

P9: I think I have to log in first, don't I? Or… let me see, I'll click on Ask VA, because I love that. Another thing that I really enjoyed about this site is… I don't know if you noticed, but other VA portals, you have to scroll all the way to the bottom, and it's way off to the right in the corner, and if you're on your phone, which I use a lot. I like using the VA app on the phone, and not always, but sometimes the buttons and the text and things you need to do are buried, and I really like the fact that this site has it right in the middle of the screen, right up front. To, to get to it. And so here, Oh, you want me to proceed? It says, confirm my personal information. Just continue. It looks good, that's me. Did I lose you?

Researcher: I think… no, you can go ahead on as… kind of, remember, as if we weren't necessarily here.

P9: Oh, sorry, that's right.

Researcher: And talk me through what you're thinking as you walk through it.

P9: So I basically enter a very simple, question, is what I'm looking for, and… and I've learned interacting with a lot of different photos out there, you gotta keep it simple, especially with AI. They cannot handle long paragraphs, you know? It's very frustrating, so I like the fact you get the window, you put in what you're looking for, and now it's asking me to categorize my issue. And so, that's good. And, This is really clean, I love this. The only thing I don't like about the topics is it's not alphabetical. I'm a highly educated person, and there are certain norms that teach you in college in various programs, everything has to have some kind of logical order. It's either date-driven, that's either driven by priorities, or absent any of that, alphabetical helps. And so, in this case, the topics should be topical. And it should be, like, my opinion. I have to sit here and read all of these, and what most people do, they'll read and they go, okay, it's this one right here, that's where they'll stop. But there may be something else more valuable. I don't know if that feedback is useful to you, but And actually, this is, These are interesting options that are here. Several of these would be interesting to me. But I would think that for this case, it'll be, Let me see here… Do-do-do-do-do… Actually, I don't know. Title 32 is me. Are these supposed to function? So… oh, it's already got my, category, selected. Education, benefits, and Work Study. Okay. Is there a subtopic I'm supposed to pick, or… Oh, I can't talk to you, sorry.

Researcher: Yeah, I can give you a reminder of the prompt, though. You're having issues with your work-study benefits.

P9: Thank you.

Researcher: And I guess before we move on to this next list, if we could go back one, I did want to… you were starting to talk through this, And so, yeah, what does this list mean to you?

P9: I don't… so… I have a reactive mind that's very distracted easily, my case of ADHD, And so it's easy for me to go down this list and then start wondering. About, huh, that's interesting, I wonder what that means. And so, I could easily be, derailed, if you will. So, I don't know, I mean, I think the alphabetical… if I already know what my issue is, if this was alphabetical, then I would go right to it. And I do see work studies at the end, so I guess there's no excuse for that. And it is alphabetical, so there's… that's crazy talk. I'm so used to seeing glyphs from the VA that are not alphabetical. I'm the guy that goes to the grocery store and is upset that the spices aren't in alphabetical order. No, this is good. But I got distracted, and I started actually looking through all of these, and going, huh, I don't even know what 1607 is. I want to look that up later. Because it goes back to… The VA has a difficult time in getting the right information in front of the right veteran at the right time. And… and I don't know if it's because they're not doing enough of what you're doing here, or… they don't understand the veteran population. But, I found the list very interesting. What I would do normally is take a screenshot of this, and after I'm done, I'm going to go back and do some research to find out what… what are compliance surveys? I'd like to know what that is. So that's… anyway, let me know if you need more.

Researcher: Yeah, how important do you think these questions are? Like, maybe the… there was a previous one, and this one.

P9: No, I like it. I like the, the process of asking questions, instead of having me trying to… dive through a lot of information to dissect it and analyze it to determine… because you can see a lot of these things on this list would definitely send me off on a wild goose chase for the next hour. trying to, A, go, is this the right one for me, or is this applying to something else? But, in this case here, I just got ahead of myself based on… on, experience and sentiment. And I cannot think of a better way to organize this. So far, this is really nice and easy. You know, so…

Researcher: And what would you do if you couldn't find an option that fit your needs?

P9: Well, I would obviously, well, I would try to, find out about it, click on it, see if there's anything more on it. I've been through those exercises before where I find out that I went off on a tangent that really didn't apply to me. So, that's on me, and I don't know how we can educate the user or the consumer But I like where this is going. It's getting a lot easier and more efficient than, you know, the last 10 years of my working with the VA. Where stuff is just too convoluted. This is… this is nice. I don't know if all those topics really apply. If there was an AI agent already, in the back, working. It would know a little bit about me. And it was started to tailor. I said, I think what you're looking for is this, is that right? And so that is… I take over 40 courses in AI implementation, and I've actually implemented AI, web blogs and, portal assistance. For the federal government, for the Department of Education. And so I know what's the art of the possible, and it's already there. On Azure, it's very easy to set up an AI agent, that once you have the person's profile. And what they tend to be, categorized in, it'll deliver information that's only relevant to that veteran, you know, with a plus or minus.

Researcher: Okay. Okay, yeah, thanks for kind of letting me dive a little bit deeper on some of this stuff. You can go ahead and continue as if you were trying to, just continue seeking the help you needed. And talk through, again, what you're seeing as you're… as you're here.

P9: Now, I like the, very nice, brief, subtopics. You know? I think… it's very easy on the eyes, very easy. I've already gone through each of them and digested it in my mind. Had they been longer sentences, you know, it would be much more distracting and time-consuming. So, this is very nicely laid out, very simple, straightforward, and it's alphabetical. It's, you know, you look at it thematic, subjective, you look at other factors, what's important here? The fact that you narrow these down to very simple, actionable words, that makes my life a lot easier. So you go through a process of elimination, in my mind, and going, it's not 3 of these, and so the tendency is to go general question. So I would… I would go between application and general question to address my particular problem. Because I've already applied, because that's not it, so it's, definitely a general question, so… There was my logic to getting to it, and so… Yep, and then I would go on to the next, and I go, okay, that makes sense, because I've already applied, I have a problem with my situation. Okay. Again, very nice, clean, pristine, website. So…

Researcher: Can you describe a scenario where you might want to attach something to this?

P9: I tend to generally, drag and drop is my preference. I go to my computer. I already have a file, in there under my VA folder, and I know exactly what I want to upload that is the file that I'm having… that relates to my application that I'm having problems with. In this case, I clicked the upload because Obviously there's nothing on my computer to drag and drop, but, this is easy enough. And then, that's the file. I would change the folder if I needed to. I use, specific folder for VA stuff, where I keep my material. And then I would do a continue, so… I'm the veteran, yep, and… Again, really nice and simple, clean, portal to digest. California. That's where I wanted to retire, San Diego. Nobody wants to go. I guess it's… There's nothing to pick there, or…

Researcher: Yeah, what do these things mean to you?

P9: Well, it's relevant. One of my pet peeves, and I spent a year as a vagabond. I was unemployed And I was denied services at the local level, federal level, because they always wanted to know where I live. And so I spent a year taking trains traveling the country. And, you know, it's cheaper to stay in hotels in, really, faraway places from big cities, because I could afford, with the pension and VA assistance.

Researcher: to actually…

P9: take classes and work in various places, but I didn't really have for a year a residence. And so this is a big pet peeve. I've written to Congress and state senators. There's a group of veterans that people like to label as homeless. I would argue there's a category of veterans like me that chose not to be tied down. For financial reasons. In my case. there are other veterans that I've met and talked to that, you know, they have psychological issues or whatever, and they're actually comfortable and happy having that freedom to, you know, live elsewhere. But they're tied to a residency, and so I argued that the people that need the most help There's a big group of them. 60% or more, they don't have residency, and they don't want the residency, and so they're obstructed from getting the services they need. and there has to be an acceptance, I think. Why does it matter? You know? And this is where, you know, I argue… I saw in the news yesterday, a senator said that we're actually 22 countries, I argue that we're not. We're 22,000 countries. We don't have national, programs, even with a VA. these kinds of things seem very trivial, but they really, upset some veterans, and they walk away. They don't get the services they need. And, I worry about those people, because they have… some of them, well. I don't want to generalize, but I've met a lot of them that have… they have some problems, you know? Either they're overly medicated, or they have other problems. And they turn these little things into major, major pet peeves, and I'm like, can't you lie and put down your relative's address or something as a residency? And, so, anyway, I always argue and go, who cares? What does it matter what my residency state is? So, but, you know, I play the game, and I pick it. It would, you know… Is that too much? I know you're watching the clock, you're a good facilitator, keep me focused.

Researcher: Yeah, I will have us kind of continue on, but I really appreciate understanding that from you.

P9: There are no homeless veterans. Seriously. You're not homeless if you choose to be that way, you know what I mean? Anyway, I could talk about this for an hour or more.

Researcher: So, if you would, continue showing us how you might, just finish out seeking help in this way.

P9: Yeah, this is… this is good. I always like the fact that they keep verifying. The VA's getting better. I testified in Congress, and actually testified. where the VA was not talking to each other. You'd update your information here, but it would not propagate to other regional and dedicated servers. It's getting better. But every now and then, I still find, an outdated piece of information. So I think this is really important to verify. And again, if we're dealing with veterans that have issues, psychological issues, I have a friend that I met by helping volunteering. that had a traumatic brain injury, and sometimes he totally forgets where he's at in place and time. He still thinks he's, like, you know, 10 years. So when they look at this, they may put in a phone number from a long time ago, or they may validate it. So it's nice to keep… to see this, and it's… I like the fact that it's Nice and clean, and then validating the information. And, I changed my first name. I'm calling myself Lou now, so I'll put that in there. Didn't do that before.

Researcher: Okay.

P9: I don't… I'm afraid of ICE coming to arrest me and deport me, so I figured if I call myself Lou Gonzalez, I sound like a baseball player, and they'll leave me alone. Okay, bad joke. It says… oh god, this is recorded. I'm going to… I'm definitely gonna get deported now. So I… again, another clean, simple page that it was before. I validated I'm here. There is a limit to how many layers we have to go through to get to the information. That is still a pet peeve and frustration. But what I like here, though, is that they're simple enough That, they're clean, and for some reason, they're much tolerable. If I were to see a whole page with all these questions on it. I would get turned off. So kudos on how you guys, designed this one. It made it a lot easier to flow. So here I am. Gives me a chance to edit my answers. Yep, okay, that's good. The file is the correct one there. I've uploaded the wrong file before, you know. Get a call. Hey, why didn't you send us this file? I didn't realize I changed the name or something. Category validation of everything. And this is quite helpful, because I don't know about you, but in my life, I get a lot of distractions. I'm an older person, I have 3 kids, they call me all of a sudden. what should take only, like, 5 minutes will take me 2 hours, you know? I got a dog like you, you know? The dog is sick and is constantly peeing everywhere. And so, it's nice to come back to that and go, where was I? And to review this. And again, kudos, because this is laid out very nicely. I'm colorblind. That's the other thing that I argue, I've met so many colorblind people in the military. I don't buy this… this bullshit that it's 3 million… only 3 million people on the average have colorblindness in America, because I know 3 million people that have colorblindness. And so, this is a really nice, easy, to view page. And I'm not against color, but sometimes I'm looking at colors and I'm going, what is that? I can't tell if there's something in there. And by the way, again, cut me off if I'm talking too much, I use AI now on my phone, and I go, what is this? Is there something in there? And it'll tell me things that I didn't see. So I really love where we're going across the board with AI. I'm not a complete, I don't completely trust AI, But it's definitely helped me in my life already so much. And I don't know if you know that, but you can put an image in there and go, can you tell me what text is in that image? And I found that helpful already. It's really cool. I mean, it's a little bit, destabilized, and that actually happened not too long ago. I actually wrote to my professor, and I said.

Researcher: Quick question.

P9: Yeah.

Researcher: to kind of… I think to close out this task that we were… we were doing, I wanted to kind of understand from your perspective, on a scale from 1 to 5, how easy or difficult was it to complete that task? And 1 being very difficult, 5 being very easy.

P9: Yeah, it was very easy. Five, and again, the top three reasons is it's very simple, very brief, each one. It's not overwhelming. And, simplistic language, really, really made it a lot easier to go through it very quickly.

Researcher: Okay. And on a scale from 1 to 5, how satisfied were you with the process? So, 1 being very unsatisfied, and 5 being very satisfied.

P9: A 5. I've been in these settings in other UX, where I actually, said, this is terrible, there's so much on there, why do you have to put so much? I can't believe I'm actually saying, this is, this is perfect.

Researcher: And how did you feel overall about the length of the form?

P9: Very nice. I think I talked about that earlier. It's… it was very much to the point, only the necessary verbiage, and… and… and easy to navigate. There was no distractions, and it was easy to flow across, and to see. And then at the end, a very nice laid-out, responses, so that I could verify that.

Researcher: And what would you do next after submitting your question here?

P9: Well, I, I tend to print this for my rep, so I can easily refer to it. And then I use it as a physical reminder, you know, that I have something on paper, and I'll put it on my calendar. Hey, check to see in a week if there's any update. You know, it says here, you should receive an email within 7 days, so I'll put a task around my calendar to remind me at 6 days. to be on the lookout for something. And if I don't see anything within 2 weeks, then I'm calling and asking what's going on, so…

Researcher: And what would you expect AskVA to do next?

P9: Well, they would, I would, hope a human, would reach out to me, via… it can be via email or something, saying, we have everything we need, and this is what we're going to take, what steps we're going to take, and we fixed whatever the issue was, or they asked me for more, information, so, or a determination.

Researcher: Okay. Great. That was the… the end of that task. We are… we do have a few more tasks, so I am gonna try and, push this along. I've just put another link in the Zoom chat, if you're able to get back to the Zoom window. And then once you get that link open, I'll kind of walk you through, another scenario.

P9: I clicked it.

Researcher: Okay. So, again, imagining that you've already logged into your VA account. And it's maybe been a month or so since you submitted that question. In that time, maybe you've submitted other questions through AskVA. I want you to go back to see the specific question you asked about your work-study benefits, and show us how you would check on that question.

P9: Yeah, so I would, basically go through here and see if my, where my question is. I would have thought that it would have been the last, entry. Here, so, view the details to validate yep. So, there it is.

Researcher: And if you go back one page, as you're looking for a previous question, what attributes of that question are you looking for? And yeah, you can do the back bar in the browser, perfect. So what attributes are you looking for about your previous question?

P9: Yeah, to me, the most important thing is the date, you know, make sure that I'm not looking at the wrong year. That's happened to me. It's embarrassing, that's the first thing. And then validate that the question is the, the correct question or the correct issue. And then the status, I'm like, okay, I'm here about the first one, but I notice there's a reply down here on this. I like the fact that this has a history. I don't know how far back it goes, but I really… I always appreciate those. And then go, oh, I didn't see that reply. I can… I'll stop there, but I've had experiences where stuff didn't come to me for some reason. who knows, email, whatever. And, you know, the VA's getting better now. They email you, and they actually mail you a physical copy. Now, it's actually an annoyance. I get all this mail from the VA now, but I can't complain anymore, because I'm getting notifications by one way or another, so…

Researcher: That's basically it. And what information is most important from what you see here?

P9: Well, again, the status is important, but once I establish the date, then this correct time frame is the status. Is there any update there? Did I miss something? Where are we? And, you know, I don't see a status update per se. I don't know what the star means, so I'll be… Clicking on that, you know, review the details to see if that explains what, Okay, that's the same thing. Oh, so new, that's what it means, okay. Oh, nice, there's an inbox here with, a history, that's good. And so, you know, I may, And be satisfied at this point, and stop, and go, okay, this is… this is right, it's being worked, and just be a little more patient. Or, go back and go, Okay. maybe send the VA a message, but .

Researcher: If we go back one more page, I just had a couple more questions for you on this one. Is there anything else that would be helpful for you to finding the question you were looking on, you were kind of hoping to check on? Is there any other information that would be helpful to see here?

P9: I mean, I don't think so. I'm a fan of using the search, you know, because I do a lot of work, and sometimes if there's a list of too many things, I will put in a keyword and search and get right to the matter.

Researcher: What would you type in in this case, or what kinds of things would you want to type in the search here?

P9: Well, I mean, in this case, it'll either be a pay or a work study. I would put in a work study, to see anything that's relevant, any submissions, related to not only my last one. To see what's there. It's helpful sometimes when I see a history of things that are related, because it reminds me of things that I forgot about, you know? Go ahead.

Researcher: And, yeah, what order are you seeing the questions here?

P9: So, they're chronological, which is, I'm a big fan of that, that's good.

Researcher: Is there any other way that you would want to see these ordered?

P9: For me personally, no, because… the status, it'd be another place where I would click and see what is still open, you know, what's closed that I wasn't aware of. So, you know, actually, you know, I do, out of habit, tend to click around and see different options. So, I would look at the date. the question, but I'll also check the status. If I see everything says it's closed, or there's a couple things still in progress or open, I would drill further into those to go, what's going on there?

Researcher: Okay.

P9: Again, my kudos is that this is… this is laid out very… it's very pleasant to the eye, the way it's laid out. And I can get into more specifics as an IT person, you know? IT people are horrible. I was a computer programmer, developer. They're the worst. they will compact things and put it in a way that's very economical for them, and they forget the user. This is very, very pleasing to look at, very easy to digest very quickly.

Researcher: Okay. Well, we are going to actually move into our third task, and I think before we do that, I kind of wanted to set that up appropriately. We're going to be completing the same tasks in a slightly different system. Some things may be very similar to you, while others might be different, and so we wanted to understand your preference overall. So, I'm going to be putting a new link into the Zoom chat again. And then, once we get that open, I will, give you another prompt, and I think because we only have, like, 13 minutes to complete two more tasks, I will ask you to kind of still talk out loud as you're going through, but I'll probably have a little bit less questions for you. So, okay, so you've opened it up, and just as we did before, imagine you're having an issue with your work-study benefits. So, you've been directed to ask VA to get help with this issue, so go ahead and show us how you would do that. And again, talking through what you're thinking.

P9: Oh, sorry, yeah. So again, I like the layout that it's saying, is this you? This is your information. I validated it's all me, that's good. And again, these are easy, small, pages, if you will, to get to the, matter. In this case, it's not alphabetical order, but my item is right there in the beginning, that's correct. And then, Again, very nice, easy layout, very simple to navigate and understand. This one is alphabetically, ordered. I explained before my, my, is that really all necessary? But it's… we're good. And, I have another general question. Let me see here, yep. And… I'm the veteran, always. That's it, I'm moving to California. Information's all good. I entered what I want to be called now. Very good.

Researcher: So, on this page, I'm curious, as you look through this, I know you weren't able to type anything in, but can you walk me through what… what you might want to type into these fields?

P9: Yeah, so, I don't know if it's because of my training and stuff, but I'm a… As a manager, well, I'm laid off by the Trump administration this year, so I'm out of work. But, I used to harp on this to all my people. Please, change the subject last. And so there's protocols in education that says the subject line on any correspondence is the last thing you ever fill out that people don't read today, and they do whatever they want to, or they'll keep the same subject, or they'll put a subject that's very long. be very, explicit to the point, succinct. What is… what is it that you want people to focus on, you know? And so… I like the… I like the subject it picked for me. If I was receiving this, I would go, okay, great, I can deal with this.

Megan Salerno: Excuse me.

P9: Instead of, you know, I have a problem, and I'm angry, and I want some service, and I want some support, blah blah blah blah blah, you know, and you know, what do they want? And so, I like to be upfront, brief, and that's what I would type, as brief and actionable, clear communication. So that, hopefully, that would make whoever's in the VA… sometimes they don't read. I've done this before, and they'll still come back to me with stupid questions and go, but I answered all this. Why are you asking me this again? What is it that you want? I don't understand. I need help with my work-study payments, so that's what I would focus on, the subject I think is very important. I like the opportunity to be able to edit that and make it clear. And then, I'm a… I know I talk a lot, but I'm actually a fan of brief. Right up front, you know, the old bluff you started about in the military. Basically line up front first. you know, in World War II, it was actually a curse word, basically not, you know, but in modern times, you can't use those curse words. But, what is it that we want? And I like that. And, you know, another feature I really enjoy the VA is doing now, they used to not do this all the time, is the ability to expand this window. I know it sounds like a minor. I hate working these little tiny windows. In this case, the form is good, but sometimes I like to expand that window out so that I can, work and, Not make a mistake and hit the wrong key or something. The files uploaded there, everything's looking good, and make it easy, because It's a very nice, clean. I apologize, I had too much coffee, no, no, lunch yet. Again, once again, to review all of my answers and what I was looking at. I would print this page as well, for my records, on a PDF on the computer, so this is… I really appreciate this. And… because when I'm on a phone call, somebody calls me, and they go, well, you know, we didn't get your email address, and I can go back here, and I go, no, I did put in… oh, shit, I put in the wrong one. So it's, it's nice to have this, Clean one. And then I would submit.

Researcher: And so, on a scale from 1 to 5, how easy or difficult was it to complete this task? 1 being very…

P9: Extremely.

Researcher: Well, 5 being very easy.

P9: 5. Definitely five.

Researcher: And then, on a scale from 1 to 5, how satisfied were you with this process? 1 being very unsatisfied, and 5 being very satisfied.

P9: I was very satisfying, because, it treated me as an individual, and it kept my information. It wasn't just a generic, you know, drop in the middle of the ocean. I felt that it was connected, you know, and it was information about me, and it retained that, and everything was good, and gave me a chance to validate and verify and submit, so…

Researcher: Okay. And I'm gonna put the fourth and final link in our Zoom chat, so I'll have you go ahead and open that one up. And as that opens up, again, you're already logged into VA, and I want you to imagine that it's been a month or so since you submitted your Ask VA question about your work-study benefits. So show us how you would go back and check on that question here.

P9: Yeah, I really like this layout, because instead of being a table or a ledger. there's psychological studies on that, that people tend to want to use tables, but it's not good for the human. This is a really nice laid-out site, and it's got nice blocks with key information. That is very easy to digest, and I like the button that says new, you know, and so immediately I'm attracted to that, and I go, that's the one that I'm interested in. And then I can scroll down, just kind of look at all the others, and go, oh yeah, I remember that one. Okay, I remember that one. I didn't realize I was still in progress. But I really like this dashboard, you know, it's like a very nice layout of the things that I was working on. And then.

Researcher: And what information is most important to you on that screen?

P9: Well, the first thing I look at is, the buttons that say, you know, status, they really stick out. So, new was the first thing that really stuck out to me because of the way it's been, designed. And then the next thing is to validate, is this the right, yeah, this is the one I submitted. And I don't understand the difference between the last update and the submission. The dates don't seem to make sense, but that's… those are… the dates are always very important to me, so in my mind…

Researcher: What… what do you think, like, how do you interpret those states, as they are?

P9: Well, I look at this as my application, or whatever the underlying, claim or whatever. was last updated by the VA on that date. And then I submitted my, inquiry, or whatever, or asked for assistance on that date. That's how I interpret it. But I'm not sure everybody else would do that. you know, they would complain and call and go, how come it hasn't been updated? I submitted this on October 20th. Why has that date not been, changed? And I don't think that's the intent here, but… I'm trying to be brief, I know.

Researcher: No, that's great. Is there anything else that you would like to see here? Anything on… any other information that would be helpful?

P9: Hi, I always would like to have somebody to be able to contact, or somebody to reach, and that's very difficult with the VA. There is no, you know, press here, send a message in the system to go, hey, I have a question. They always make you call, you know, and it's very, very difficult. I know that's nothing to do with the technology or the portal. That's an infrastructure thing, if you will, with the VA. They really don't like engaging with veterans, and I don't blame them. You know, we can be difficult, but… I think it would relieve a lot of frustration if veterans had a way to communicate. In IT, I took psychology. It says, half the battle is communicating with the customer. Even though you may not have the answer, just communicating, have that feedback, tempers people's, frustration. And so I run IT help desk, I go, I always tell my people. Don't tell them to reboot. Don't tell them to, you know, try back in a week. show that you care, that you're interested, and you're working with them. And that would resolve a lot of the anxiety and stress that I see a lot of VAs… really, it's everybody, but veterans as well. Again, sorry, I'm going off, off, off, script.

Researcher: What order are you seeing your questions in here?

P9: Well, I… it's, by date, obviously, but, first, the first is the status, which just says it's new. That's right up there on the forefront, and then the one next one is in progress. You know, go across and then down.

Researcher: And what order would you like to see these in?

P9: I like it in this order. I like it in this order. I know I harped on date, but the change in status is helpful, so… So it should be status, in this case, it makes sense because of the way it's laid out, and then the date, you know, so…

Researcher: Okay. Well, I know we just have a couple more minutes, so I am going to close this out. I've got a couple, like, follow-up questions, and I'm actually going to take over sharing my screen here. So let me pull that up, and you should… Let me just confirm, you can… can you see my screen? Okay, so you got to experience two different versions of AskVA today, and the first task that you went through was submitting a question to AskVA, so… The picture on the left represents your first experience, the picture on the right represents your second experience, and I'm curious which of those two experiences you preferred for submitting a question to AskVA.

P9: Yeah, I, I prefer the first one, the asking the question. But I know that's me, because, like I told you before, I'm very brief. And I know what I want. I get frustrated on VA sites and elsewhere when I have to learn what the categories are, dissect all that stuff. And if we're using technology like AI, it makes it a lot easier. If I just put in my question, and it takes me to, you know, where I should be, instead of having to understand the lingo that the VA uses. Make sense? So my preference, both are good, my preference is for the first one, because it's more of a human interaction, as opposed to… I don't care what the VA calls it, I just have a problem, you know?

Researcher: Yeah.

P9: I tell you, when I testified in Congress years ago, I said, Mr. Congressman, I said, do you know the difference between compensation and a benefit? You know, V, I would kill you, because they go, would you like benefits or compensation? I'm going, aren't they the same?

Researcher: Yeah. No, I appreciate that. That's… that's really good context. this was the, kind of, second and fourth task that we went through, was you were looking at a previous question, and so the representation on the left was the first experience you saw, and the one on the right was the… that one we were just looking at. So I'm curious, which of these two you would prefer to reviewing a previous question with AskVA?

P9: Yeah, I, I like the second one, and the reason why is, my eyes tend to kind of get lost and hypnotized when I see tables. And I know a lot of people have been conditioned, that's always what they expect, and that's what they're used to. In technology, it's very hard to get people to change, but to me, the right side is easier to digest with the eyes. It's much more efficient. yes, I have power on the left, the table, because I can, you know, do various things to it, but my preference is, as soon as I saw that second one, go, huh. I felt it was like, this is fresh, it's modern, and it was very easy to absorb the information.

Researcher: Okay. Well, I know we're at time, so I won't, ask any additional questions, and one thing I wanted to do was just kind of circle back to something we talked about at the beginning. I wanted to reconfirm, now that we're done with the session, whether or not you would be comfortable if we were to share a video clip from this session with our VA partners. And just kind of as a reminder, we would strip off any identifiable information. And we share these to really help and improve our VA.gov and other digital experiences with the VA. So, with that in mind, is that okay if we would be sharing any kind of video clip with our viewers?

P9: That's fine.

Researcher: Okay.

P9: Yes.

Researcher: Well, thank you so much for your time today. You have such, like, broad experiences in… this type of thing, and support, and with veterans, and I'm just so grateful that you came and met with us today, and gave us all of your insights. I think you really talked through your experiences, as well as a lot of other folks' experiences, and it was really great to just, like, get that wealth of understanding, So, I think the last thing I will say, because I do know you have a strong network with other veterans, Paragian will send you kind of a little thank-you note and a blurb that you could pass along to other veterans to participate in studies like this. That's super helpful for us, just to get a lot of different folks' perspectives on these types of digital experiences, so if you'd feel comfortable passing that along, I think it would be really great to continue, just getting additional veterans' perspectives on things.

P9: Oh, I'd love to do that, yeah. And again, thank you for your great facilitation, and I try to control myself, you know, as I get older. It gets weirder. Thank you. You guys have been great, I appreciate that, so hopefully this will make a difference, and I know I'm one out of, you know, many, but I'm looking forward to that. I'll definitely send it to a bunch of veterans that I know, so…

Researcher: Awesome. Thank you so much. I hope you have.

P9: Hey, my daughter's in Baltimore, so… it's… you can put a picture of Baltimore back there, it's okay.

Megan Salerno: Don't take it through, now that I know it's a big hit. Thank you for mentioning that, that was a great connection point.

Researcher: Good point. Thank you so much. Have a great day.

P9: Thank you, guys. Appreciate what you're doing. Thank you so much.

Researcher: Bye.
