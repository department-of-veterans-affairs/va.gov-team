Researcher: Start that recording now. So, now that I've started the recording, I'm gonna ask you one more time if you would just confirm that you're comfortable with recording today.
P8: Yes, I am.
Researcher: Awesome. Thank you for letting me walk through all of that, and just trying to set your expectations for the session. Before we jump into some questions, do you have any questions for me?
P8: No, as of now, no.
Researcher: Okay. Awesome. So, in the initial survey that you filled out, you indicated that you use VA's education or training benefits. Can you tell me a little bit more about how you're currently using those benefits?
P8: Sure, so I have, you know, the GI Bill, which is, from the VA. I mean, obviously, when I joined the Army. So I actually, you know, signed up for VRNE, which I'm, you know, applicable for, and I'm a disabled veteran, so that's how, I wanted to use the VRNE. So I signed up for that when I log in via VA login, and then, you know, gave all the details, I filled out the forms and everything. So I'm in the steps where, you know, the… I think the associates, from the VR&D program are reaching out now to make sure, you know, what I'm interested in, how do I use it with all the process and everything at the moment.
Researcher: Okay.
P8: And…
Researcher: Have you experienced any challenges in relation to receiving these education benefits?
P8: Not that many, actually. It was, it was good, straightforward, I would say, for me. At least for me. I could understand the, you know, exactly the forms, what were available, and what to fill, and what not to fill. And if, obviously, any questions, I made sure to go online to figure out on the Google, or maybe, you know, ChatGPT nowadays, so it was not that bad, I would say, yeah.
Researcher: Okay. And maybe thinking broadly to any kind of engagement you have with VA, have you contacted VA for any kind of support, say, in, like, the last 6 months?
P8: Yes, yes, I did, for my appointments, I do regular, I would say, you know, half-yearly or quarterly appointments with my, you know, the doctor. So, I kind of log in and obviously check my disability details. As well as, you know, what is available, what is, not available. So, medical refills, and when you say contact especially, yes, I do contact, from the, you know, I message them first, and then make sure to get the message back with the details, and then call them back. So that's how I use the VA.gov to reach out to them.
Researcher: Okay, and you talked about, like, messaging and potentially calling. Is there maybe any particular experience where you required some VA support that you could talk a little bit more, maybe, about how you were messaging or calling them?
P8: Sure, so when I go, and, you know, obviously, I, I think, when I go to the appointments, if I have something, appointment which is already in place, for example, if I wanted to reschedule or something, there's a… button or something, like, where you can message them, and ask for the reschedule, or ask for a particular date, if you don't… if they… I mean, because when you reschedule it, you don't have the opportunity sometimes to get that particular date. Maybe it's blocked out, or it's already filled out. So what I do is, I just message, and the nurse practitioner comes into the picture first. They're very… they're very… good at the return time, I would say. I think they have a SLA of 24 hours or something, because I've seen, good replies from them, coming back saying that, you know, yes, this is available, or maybe we can… if any of the other veteran changes their schedule, we'll come back and reschedule, or something like that, right? Because my schedule might be tight sometimes, so that I can't make it the other days, which is available for them. So, yeah, then the nurse comes up, asks my dates, and then as I get the date, I talk to the doctor if anything is required from my side, like any, scans or something, which I can get from my side. So that's how it goes, and I make the appointment correctly and successfully.
Researcher: Okay. And have you ever used a tool called AskVA?
P8: What was that, sorry, Actweed?
Researcher: Ask VA.
P8: Yes, it's like a, you know, I think, what do you call, a chat feature, right? I didn't, exactly see the name, but I think Askway is something like that, where you type in your question, and then the kind of automated chat comes up where it'll try to guide you on what is available or what is not available, I guess.
Researcher: Okay.
P8: I tried it, if I'm not wrong, but I don't remember the exact, what I typed in. Yeah.
Researcher: Okay. Yeah, well, thank you for just giving me some more background, about, kind of, your engagement with VA, and just to understand a little bit about your experiences.
P8: Sure. So…
Researcher: At this point, I'm going to move us into the next part of our session, where I'll be providing you with some different scenarios and tasks. I wanted to get us started by having you share your screen with us first, and so at the bottom of the Zoom screen, there's, like, a green Rectangle with an arrow in it, where you should be able to, share your screen with us. And then once you've got screen sharing, I will send a link in the Zoom chat.
P8: Sure, One second, doing it now…
Researcher: Okay, I see your screen coming up. So I just added the link in the Zoom chat, if you're able to get back to that and either click on it or copy and paste it into your browser there. So, as that pulls up, imagine that you've already logged into your VA.gov account. And you're having an issue with your work-study benefits. You've been directed to ask VA to get help with your issue. Before clicking on anything here, I want you to take a second to look around and talk out loud about what it is that you're seeing.
P8: I see that, you know, what exactly is ASCVA? Like, what, what is the purpose of it? So if I want answers to any questions about the VA benefits, right, I should receive a reply within the 7 business days. That's what is the first thing which I see on this page. And, how much time does it take to complete this form? You know, if I can, or if I want to ask a new question, I guess I can fill out another form here by clicking that. Mmm… Can I click on this plus sign to figure out, what it is? Can I click on that, Elena?
Researcher: So you can kind of explore as you would, and like I said earlier, some things will work, and some things will not.
P8: Okay, yeah, I was expecting this to, like, you know, give the, I guess, Chevron, like, button, like, where it gives me the other options, what is in this, but I think, it gives me… I don't know, maybe since the demo, it's not working, but, I feel like it is a place where what exactly, or when to use this AskVA. And, yep, those are the main…
Researcher: And what are your expectations after kind of walking through that? What are your expectations of AxBA?
P8: The main expectation is, I think, once I submit this, form, right, about any VA benefits or services, I will be, you know, helped out with the questions and answers, what I ask. About my, benefits, about the veteran benefits or the services, which is… what is available.
Researcher: And how long would you expect it to get the help you need through ASC VA?
P8: Like, 7 business days, I reply within 7 business days.
Researcher: Okay. So, now that you've kind of walked through this a little bit, now go ahead and show us how you would use AskVA to get help with your work-study benefits issue.
P8: work-study benefits issue. First, what I would do is, since, it's a issue, for sure, I wanted to ask a new question. So this is, This is giving me the date I bought me, like, for the name and the last four and, my date of birth here. I click on continue. It's going to give me the, criteria, like, what exactly my questions are related to. And, Erinna, sorry, I missed it, but what was the, category you were mentioning, is it work.
Researcher: Yeah, if you had an issue with your work-study benefit.
P8: Work study, okay, okay, Yep, I would choose the first one, which is already checkmarked, Education Benefits and Work Study. But, there are other, things or topics. As I mentioned, this was the one which I used before, VRNE. So I'll choose the first one at this moment. I'll continue. So after I choose it, it is giving me, you know, what exactly is the topic, based off, like, you know, what, what, What are the internal things related to this, work study, right? Makes sense. So, I'll choose the licensing and testing fees. Oh, actually, there is an option already here, right? Works today? My bad. These are all the things available, but Work Study is the one which is the issue, so I'm gonna select that.
Researcher: So I'll have us just go… I'm gonna ask a couple questions about, kind of what you were talking through there. Maybe we can go back one page.
P8: Okay.
Researcher: So, yeah, I guess the first thing I'll ask is, you were clicking on licensing and testing fees. I guess, just in general, looking at this list and that one in particular, what does this list mean to you?
P8: So I thought, this is, like, everything or all the categories available under the education, benefits, and Work Study. So, when you say work-study, I didn't, really catch that… that is the exact, issue. So, I didn't, think that that would be a topic available directly. So… I thought, like, licensing and testing fees also comes under work-study issue. Maybe I'll check that and take that one as an example. That's the reason I… I went over it. But, again, as you… as I clicked it, I came to know that there is an option work study already, which I didn't read it, so I selected the direct option of work study then.
Researcher: Okay. And when you think about this list and the one previous that you selected already, how important are These lists to you.
P8: Very much important, because, this gives me the, bandwidth, or the categories or criteria, like, you know, what is available, or what I can select and ask questions on. And actually, reading this, it gives me ideas, like, you know, what I'm missing on sometimes. And, if I'm applicable to the… applicable to it, how can I apply going back and, you know, researching on that, right? So, it's a very good thing, I would say.
Researcher: And if you had, if you couldn't find an option that fit your needs, what would you do in that case?
P8: Mmm. Yeah, if in that case, what I would do is… I would choose something which is near to the functionality, what I am having issues with, and then, if I have the opportunity to discuss or have a description in the next pages, I will give that, the exact issue. But if that's not the case, I'll just submit it, and when someone reaches me out. I'll try to explain them that, this is not the exact issue. I'm reaching out for something else.
Researcher: Hmm. Okay. Great, thanks for, going a little bit deeper on… on some of these things with me. Go ahead and continue on as you would,
P8: Sure. Okay… Sorry again, Alina, but, what was the exact issue? It's just work-study, or a work-study timecard, or something like that? If I missed it.
Researcher: Yeah. No, just a work-study issue.
P8: best work-study, right? Yeah, I mean, at this point, these are all the things which are related to the work-study. So, it is asking me what is exactly related, like, you know, issue with the work-study program. So… I think I'll go with the general question option, which gives me an opportunity to explain the issue. Continue. Okay, it's asking me what's the relationship to the veteran, so I'm the veteran. It's going to ask me, like, you know, what state and residency state the school is located in. Okay. Here, I was expecting to see, or select the state at which I live, but I think it's, I'm not able to select that at this moment. So, it's asking me for the contact information, which is filled out, but maybe I think I need to fill out when in the real scenario. Since I selected the general question, maybe I'm getting prompted to this, but if I select the other one, I'm thinking it would give me a different page. Do you want me to type out the question, just like an example, or…
Researcher: Yeah, I'm curious, based on your last comment, if you had selected a different field, what differences would you expect here?
P8: Like, when I selected what, sorry, can you repeat that?
Researcher: Yeah, if you could… if you selected… you mentioned that if you selected another, like, topic or something, you thought it might look different than this. I'm curious, what differences you expected.
P8: I was expecting more, like, not a typing opportunity, but maybe, like, a… A particular, line or something which says, this is the issue, if I'm related to. I just, like, a checkbox, or a… or a, or a… radio button, maybe? Select that option, and then submit it, rather typing up.
Researcher: Okay. Okay. So yeah, here, you won't necessarily be able to type into the boxes here, but if you could walk me through, kind of, what you would want to type into, the information, like, what information you want to type in here.
P8: Sure, my subject would be, like, work-study, federal, aid question? For example, and then the question would be, like, how many hours, would be I be able to do the work-study program, and, how, you know, how long is the length of the program, for example? And then… if I have something, a document of which I need to share, I'll maybe attach it, but I don't think at this moment I don't have anything, so I'll not attach anything, and then click the continue button.
Researcher: Okay. And how do you differentiate what to put in the subject versus the question field?
P8: Subject is something, like, which is, like, a gist of everything, like, of the question, right? So, summarizing the question, I would feel what is important to understand in just 3 words. I would try to give that there. That would be the only difference, but, main thing, to give the detailed thing, I would be using the question, description, notes there, whatever the space provided for me.
Researcher: Okay. And can you describe a time, maybe in your past experience, that you might want to attach something to this?
P8: It was asking me sometimes, I don't recollect exactly, but, you know, the DD214, for example, of the… or maybe the points, from my duty, previously, something like that, which I need to attach and send it to them, if needed.
Researcher: Okay. Yeah, so at this point, I think you can kind of just click into one of the typing boxes, and we can kind of continue, Looks like it'll be the subject box, if I'll have you go ahead and click on there.
P8: Okay, it got filled in. Works to the payments. I have been paid for that was when I got to the as well. Achieve them, okay. I have a quick question here, like, sometimes, this, chain, like, you know, whatever the uploaded file, is it possible to just, preview it rather than downloading, or would it be a download option?
Researcher: What would be your preference?
P8: I would like to preview it, rather download, because I wanted to see just a preview, because I know that I have… I have been… I uploaded it, so I just want to preview it.
Researcher: Okay.
P8: Yep, that's what I see, like, the question typed and the subject. Filled in, and then the file uploaded at this point. Can I continue?
Researcher: Yeah, go ahead and continue as you would.
P8: Okay. Good answers to you. Okay, it is giving me all the information, what I've selected. If I need to edit it, I have the edit options at this point. School facility, contact information is provided, and the question with the attachments is provided. Again, I can have the edit feature, where I want… if I want to add something or change the content, I can do it. At this point, yeah, submit the question. So, once I submit it, I see that a reference, has been… this reference number has been provided, and obviously an email confirmation has been sent to my email. As, as about talking with the SLA, in 7 business days, I would get a reply. And, obviously, to read the reply, I'll need to sign into the VA. Yep. That's the main takeaway from this speech.
Researcher: So what would you do next after submitting a question here?
P8: Since I have the feature of return to ask, yeah, I would click this, so that I'm at the homepage, or at the page where I… You know, the… it's like the homepage for the VA, as VA.
Researcher: And what would you expect AskVA to do next?
P8: If there is another question, I can go with that, but if not, I have already logged in, so I will use other things to figure out, about benefits, or maybe the payment, or, you know, checking the documents which are there from my service. But if not, I will again go back to the ASCV and, you know, if any… if I have more questions, I would have asked more questions.
Researcher: Okay. So, on a scale from 1 to 5, 1 being very difficult and 5 being very easy, how easy or difficult was it for you to complete this task?
P8: I would say, phi is very easy, right, you said?
Researcher: Correct.
P8: FIMA.
Researcher: Okay. And on a scale from 1 to 5, how satisfied were you with this process? So, 1 is very unsatisfied, and 5 is very satisfied.
P8: I would say 5.
Researcher: Okay. Can you expand a little bit on rating both of those questions with a 5?
P8: The main thing is it's straightforward enough, with the categories and everything, you know, asking about the benefits. I know I've just selected one, but I would like to see what I can select more of it to understand what is available. But at this point, what I did, I kind of really liked it. It was very tailored to my preference, you know, what I wanted to go with and ask for. The only, thing which I felt was… About the 7 days SLA? If that can be made a little bit, shorter, it would give more, time for the veteran to think, you know, have the different options compared at, easily, rather than taking more time.
Researcher: Hmm. Okay. Is there anything else about, what you just experienced that you particularly liked or didn't like?
P8: As, everything, is kind of similar to what I've been using, when I log into the sign-in, you know, VA.gov sign-in, I kind of felt the design and pattern was, matching everything, so, nothing new. I would say, but one thing, as I already said in the feedback, if possible, with the preview, I would, I would be more, comfortable, rather than downloading it again and again. I mean, if I want to check it, you know, once I uploaded it.
Researcher: And you're specifically talking about the attachment, is that right?
P8: Get it, Greg, yeah.
Researcher: Okay. And how did you feel about the length of the form?
P8: Not longer, it was very short, good, and Up to the point. So, yeah, no, no complaints on that. I was, understanding what I was doing. And, the options were very straightforward to understand.
Researcher: Okay. Great. I'm gonna move us into our second task, then, and I'm putting a second link into the chat for you to, again, either copy and paste or click and open in your browser. So, again, imagine that you are already logged in to your VA.gov account. And maybe it's been a month since you submitted that question. You might have submitted other questions in that time, but I now wanted you to go back to look for that specific question that you asked about your work-study benefits. Show us how you would check on that previous question.
P8: Sure. So, at this page, you know, I see that, you know, this, heading of your questions, which is, particularly saying that, you know, all the related, or what I have, previously asked, I could see in this window. And, I see that the filters are, by status and by category. As everything is all, I would see all the questions, what I've submitted, that's what I would think, and applying those filters will apply those. I see 9, questions which I have asked previously using the AskVA. And, respectively, about, the particular work-study program, I… I… I see this education category, which, you know, which is the, seeing the question. I could figure out this is the one with the work-study question, which we… which I just, submitted.
Researcher: And what attributes of your previous question are you looking for here?
P8: So technically, I was able to identify it, using the question itself, because I, understood, like, you know, about… it was about the pay and, asking about, you know, how, how I can get the status of it. I was expecting to see the subject here. So that it would be more useful and, more straightforward, also to have the subject. But I don't see that here. Instead of that, I see category. Which is not bad, but I would also prefer to have the subjects to easily identify it. But those are the attributes I'm seeing to understand, and obviously the reference number, right? If I… if I copied it in the previous page. maybe I would have had it somewhere, and I could easily do a Ctrl-F or a search on this window, paste it, and get to know the exact question. Which I wanted to, think about or, you know, see the, next things in the process.
Researcher: And what information is most important from what you see here?
P8: I would say… The reference number and the question, at the moment?
Researcher: And is there anything else that might be helpful to you for finding a previous question?
P8: Or finding a previous question, you said? Yeah, I mean, I think, this filter by status, right? If I know it is a new one, which is in that state, I would, filter by that state itself, so that I know what… what are all the questions in that new state or in-progress state, which I wanted to see, rather than, you know, giving all the questions or opening A page with all the questions which I have submitted previously.
Researcher: And what order are you seeing the questions in here?
P8: I see it in the, Actually, I feel like I don't see… I was thinking I was seeing it in the descending order, but I feel like, that's not the case. Okay, maybe, it's not based on the dates order here, like, when this… when it is submitted or last updated, I guess, but I feel like it is more on the status. The new questions come up first, and then the in-progress, followed by the sold and the reopened.
Researcher: And what order would you want to seed these in?
P8: I was, more of a thinking, like, sort by descending order, for example, like, based on the submitted date. Or ascending based on the submitted… in any one of the particular field, right? I don't think… I think, yeah, submitted on is the better, field, rather than last updated, because… I don't think that's more helpful, but, yeah, that would be good. And obviously, what I have now, I would see something in the sort by, status, maybe, related to the status filter.
Researcher: Hmm. Okay. And as you've been reviewing your questions here in AskVA, Is there anything in particular that you really liked or really didn't like?
P8: I like the filter by status, filter by category, and this feature, right? It gives me the exact criteria which I wanted to fill in and search for, when I have thousands of questions submitted, which would streamline my use case, correct? But, one thing, when you mention it hit me, like, about the dates, right? I would feel that design would do more good, And obviously, having a filter with the status also is fine, but, maybe descending order or something like that would be more, Easily understandable.
Researcher: Okay. So I want to make sure… I'm going to iterate back to you what I think I'm… I've heard. I think something that you were interested in seeing here was being able to sort by the submitted date, like, ascending or descending. Is that an accurate readback?
P8: Okay.
Researcher: Okay. Great. Any other thoughts on… Reviewing your previous questions.
P8: As I mentioned, having the subject here would be a good option too, because it would give me the exact subject and the question itself, which I was seeing on that questions page when I was submitting it.
Researcher: Okay. Great. Now, we're actually going to ask you to complete these same tasks in a slightly different system. Some things may be similar, while other things will be different, and we're looking to understand your experience in both of them. So, I, again, will be Sending a link in the Zoom chat. And I'll have you open that one up again, and as that comes up, I will kind of prompt you with, a scenario that we talked about already. So, imagine that you've already logged into your VA.gov account, and just as we did before, I want you to imagine you're having an issue with your work-study benefits. You've been directed to ask VA to get help. Show us how you would use AskVA to get help.
P8: Sure. Yeah, this seems… this seems… this page seems to be exactly the one from previous page, so, I'm pretty, you know, I'm good with asking a new question here. Same like before, I have the details about me. punching here, so I'm good here. Okay, so, this here, it directly asks me the question, like, what the question is, rather than giving me the… You know, the categories of questions first. So, I've typed the questionnaire, I click the continue. And then it asks me the category, which that falls under to decide. I guess, so… I will… choose accordingly. In this case, it has come… it is under the education and benefit work-study, use case. And then continue. So, the topic, right, it's the same as before, so I'll select the work study here. This time it is, yeah, same, same as before, I guess, subtopic. I'll, choose, General question again? And then… continue. So, previously, it was asking me the subject and description, but now I see only attachment. So, I attach the file. It's… it's me, the veteran. Same as before… Contact details of me. checking if I wanted to edit any of the… any of the things which I, Want to change at this moment? But I see that, some of them, I don't… I don't recall, but I see some of them don't have the edit option. But, yeah, for the question, at least, I have the option to edit, at this point. And then submit the question.
Researcher: So, on a scale from 1 to 5, how easy or difficult was it for you to complete this task? And 1 being very difficult, 5 being very easy.
P8: Yeah, I'd say, again, 5. It's just that a matter of some pages being randomly shifted, I guess. But other than that, it was not that hard to figure out what I want.
Researcher: And again, on a scale from 1 to 5, how satisfied were you with this process? 1 being very unsatisfied, 5 being very satisfied.
P8: I would say 4.
Researcher: Can you expand on that rating a little bit?
P8: I don't know, I… my brain is tied up with the previous, pages, I guess, which I felt it was more ordered fashion, especially with the category and all, which I was choosing at once, previously. But, at the first time, but now I feel like, I'm typing the question and selecting the category, which I feel like is a… is a… Is a scenario where, In the real use case, wouldn't be good… wouldn't fit good.
Researcher: Yeah, can you expand on that a little bit more, just around that sentiment?
P8: Yeah, it's just that, when I come in, I wanted… when I'm not clear, especially with the question, I would like to feel the categories, right? I would like to see what is available, and that gives me the idea of what I can select. So from there, when I come to the… Question page, I have that clarity because I have selected the category. But in this case, I was typing the question, and then giving it a category, which was not that helpful, I thought.
Researcher: Okay. So, when thinking about this process, was there anything, anything in particular that you liked or didn't like about this process? You've talked about it a little bit, but I wanted to ask it explicitly.
P8: Yeah, that's what, I didn't, expect, or… I wouldn't say I didn't like it, but I didn't expect that of that, page question coming up first, and then filling up the category. Other than that, everything was straightforward, yeah.
Researcher: Okay. And let's say, for instance, kind of just talking a little bit about something you said a moment ago, let's say you did know what you wanted to ask a question about, I'm thinking maybe it's something related to VR&E, is kind of something you've talked about already. In that case, how would you feel about going through and filling out the question in the way that you just did?
P8: I mean, I would be fine in that case, because, you know, since I know that what exactly the question would be, or what is running in my mind. I don't mind to type it, and then select the category. It's just that, if… given the category, the first page, I would feel like I know… What are the options available, before I go forward with the next page of, answering the question?
Researcher: Okay. And maybe, Can you talk a little bit about the importance of knowing what, like, kind of you said, you know what's available. I'm curious, like, if you can expand a little bit on, the importance of knowing that.
P8: Oh… It's, it's like, what are the options, right? Especially, sometimes, I really get lost with so many of resources available on the VA.gov. You really don't know what to, you know, pinpoint and ask for exactly. Having that categories would give me that edge of, you know, to streamline, like, you know, what exact the issue would be related to. That's why I would choose the category, and then go forward with the question typing, which would give me the option of summarizing the exact issue.
Researcher: Okay. Thank you for diving a little bit deeper into that. That definitely provides some additional context to, how you were experiencing that. Sure. So we… I'm gonna move us into our fourth and final task. I am going to put a fourth and final link into the Zoom chat for you to click on. And yeah, as that loads, I'll kind of give you your prompt. So again, imagining that you've already logged in to your VA.gov account. Imagine that it's maybe been about a month since you submitted that question. You may or may not have submitted other questions through AskVA, but you're now back to see that specific question you asked about work-study benefits. Show us how you would check on that question.
P8: Sure. So in the search bar, I would, try to type in now, especially maybe the subject, or maybe the question itself, so that I can try to find that. and obviously use the status and category also, right? Which is, available for me to check on. And obviously, I see the question, the first one is what I have submitted, and if I wanted to get more details about the question, I would click that. It gives me the status, what status it is in, and obviously the inquiry number, and the question, and the attachments. And this is the updates from the VA. What is happening on that, Question? I see that on September 19th, I got a response. And I can, send a reply to, And then attach, and then the send via message option is present at this point. And I was expecting a back button here to go to the previous page.
Researcher: Hmm. And actually, in this case, I'll have you, use the back button in your browser to go back one page. I did want to maybe ask a couple different questions, here. What attributes of your previous question are you looking for here?
P8: I would say keywords from the question, typed, and… or the subject. I would say.
Researcher: And what information is most important from what you see here?
P8: For me, it's, again, the dates I would go by. I know… I don't think there's a sort on that, but I feel like data is more important attribute. I would go by and check something. And obviously, the status followed by.
Researcher: And is there anything else that would be helpful To you in finding your previous question that you don't see here.
P8: Yeah, I don't think so. I mean, I'm good with these two attributes, and obviously this search bar is more, good, because I can directly search for that particular keywords, and get that question popped up. If I know them.
Researcher: Okay, and what order are you seeing the questions in here?
P8: Okay, I see it here on the date submitted, which is good, actually. So, yeah, I mean, this is helpful because it is a descending order, from the new to the old, so… That's what, I see.
Researcher: And what order would you want to see these in?
P8: Yeah, the same exact order, descending to ascending. The new to the… Closed to our solar ones.
Researcher: Okay. So… Let's see, I guess as you looked at reviewing questions this way, is there anything in particular that you liked, and… or anything in particular that you didn't like?
P8: I liked, the search feature, first thing, and then, the second feature would be, instead of boxes, which you… we have now, like, an Excel sheet, like, columns. So… I feel this is more, easier to find something, rather than having that big columns, sorry, big boxes, which is, with good information, like, a lot of information, but I would still, have this feature, have this look. Which is more useful, and obviously I can click the view details to go into and search for more information. About that question?
Researcher: Okay. Is there anything… I heard several things that you liked about this. Was there anything in particular that you didn't like?
P8: Didn't play. I would say, I don't know if it's possible, but maybe, feature where, like, if I click on date submitted, it should, automatically reset the… filter, like, it should go by… I mean, obviously, the default is descending to ascending, but if I click that again, it should be from ascending to descending, for example.
Researcher: Hmm. Okay.
P8: Something like that, yeah. Other than that, I wouldn't think that many things of a change here. But, those are the main things.
Researcher: And… Is there anything else about reviewing your previous question here? Any other thoughts that you have around that, besides what you've shared already?
P8: Mmm… Mmm, no, I… I think I touched all the points there.
Researcher: Okay. Great. Well, that, concludes our last task. I do have just a couple, kind of, closeout questions for you, and with that, I am actually going to take over the screen sharing, so I will go ahead and do that. And you should be able to see my screen now. Is that correct? Can you see my screen?
P8: Yes. Okay. Yes.
Researcher: Great. So you got to experience two different versions of Ask VA today, and I'd really love to understand, which one you prefer. So, the visual representation on the left is the first experience you had, and the image on the right is the second experience you had. So I'd really love to understand which one you preferred. For submitting a question.
P8: The first one, huh?
Researcher: Okay. Can you expand on that at all for me, as to why?
P8: Sure, sure. Yeah, as mentioned, I would like to select a category first, at least to fill out, you know, what I wanted to ask for, or what it is based on, rather than giving my question directly. Which I'm not sure, if I'm not sure. I want to make sure, you know, I have the category first, yeah. my choice.
Researcher: Okay. And similarly, you… you saw two different ways to review your previous questions. So on the left is the first way that you reviewed your questions, and on the right was, the way we were just looking at them. And so, when you think about those two different experiences, which of those did you prefer?
P8: The second one.
Researcher: Okay, so that's this one here.
P8: Yes.
Researcher: Okay, can you expand a little bit more on… on prefer… your preference there?
P8: Sure, main reason is, the search, thing, which… the field which was added, which is, like, a while search. by giving my keywords of the question, I could easily get it. And obviously, sorting, right, by the submitted, date is, more befitting my, desire, which I wanted to see, and, that's how I like it.
Researcher: Okay. Great. I think I did want to go back to this one, just thinking a little bit through, something you had mentioned here. you know, you were talking about… you selected the category one, the one on the left, and was just, I think, curious about… I think you said you're not sure about like, what to ask, or something like that. So I was just wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about, this preference of yours to select the category. I just want to make sure I understand.
P8: Yeah, I don't remember exactly, but I think category had a general question also as a category. I don't remember if that was the case, but I would like to see that, you know, all the categories are mentioned first, especially to, you know. where my brain already wires it with the category, rather than the one which is on the other side, where I type the question and then try to wire it with the category. I feel like we are going the other way, so it's just easier for me to fill out a category and then have the question typed out in that pattern.
Researcher: Hmm. Okay. Great, thank you for expanding on that and just making sure I understand your thought process and kind of how you're working through that. Now, overall, if you could change anything about the Ask VA experiences that you saw today, what might that be?
P8: Overall, I feel like, it was very easy to understand and follow, and, get through it. But, As mentioned, those were some of the previous, things, like, you know, I have that PDF, preview. work would be a good feature, rather than me clicking on it. When I click it, again, download and download. So that I need to go back and delete again all the files, which I already uploaded myself. And then, I don't know, I think I forgot, but I… I tried to tell you a couple of features which I kind of liked. I'm not remembering them, but I would like to see those, if possible, yeah.
Researcher: Yeah, no, no problem. Okay, I will stop sharing, and we just have a minute, so I'm gonna go ahead and close this out. I did want to circle back and reconfirm that you would be comfortable, now that we've gone through the session. If we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners, we would remove all information identifying you, but we sometimes share video clips of these sessions to continue to help improve on these digital experiences. So. Are you okay if we were to share a video clip of this discussion today?
P8: Oh, yes, if you could, I mean, clean out everything, yeah, I'm fine with that.
Researcher: Okay. Great, thank you for that. And yeah, just thank you so much for your time today. I really appreciate you walking through this with us, giving your open and honest feedback. It's been really helpful for us to make the improvements that are going to help veterans like yourself, to get the support they need. Awesome. Before we officially close out, do you have any additional questions for me?
P8: Nope, I'm good, Ben, from my side.
Researcher: Awesome. Well, thank you so much. I hope you have a great day.
P8: Thank you. Same to you.
Researcher: Bye.
P8: Bye.
