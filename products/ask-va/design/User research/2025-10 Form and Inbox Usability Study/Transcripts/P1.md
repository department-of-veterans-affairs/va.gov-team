Researcher: Okay, so now that I've started the recording, I am going to confirm with you one more time, are you okay with us recording this session?

P1: Yes, I am.

Researcher: Okay. Great. Thank you so much. I guess before we kind of jump in and actually get started now, did you have any questions for me based on all of those expectations?

P1: No, I don't.

Researcher: Okay. Awesome. So, before we kind of look at the website or anything, I wanted to start with a couple of warm-up questions. In the initial survey, you indicated that you leverage VA's education or training benefits. Can you tell me more about how you're currently leveraging those benefits?

P1: I'm gonna assume leveraging means, like, using in my life.

Researcher: Yeah.

P1: I'm currently working full-time, but I'm also, in my last semester of my bachelor's degree. And I've been using my GI Bill. I believe I also have the R&E benefits. I actually just received a letter in the mail, like, 3 days ago, but I… wasn't giving a lot… I wasn't given a lot of information in the letter, so I don't know what benefits for VR&E, I actually am eligible for.

Researcher: Okay. And have you experienced any challenges related to receiving these benefits, kind of, over the course of, maybe your studies?

P1: Mmm… Yes? I've had more issues with the VR&E than I have with, like, getting my GI Bill benefits squared away.

Researcher: Can you describe any of those that maybe come to mind?

P1: It's been… it's been a while since I applied for my GI Bill, but I do remember… I think there might have been, like, a small issue at the end, but I was able to, like, contact the VA office and get it sorted out the same day. It was just minor administrative issues.

Researcher: Hmm.

P1: VR&E was something that I applied for, let's say, a year ago now, and I was told that the process would take between 3 to 5 months. And I'd finished everything by February. And then I heard nothing. But the monthly, they send out, like, monthly messages through AskVA from your counselor to you, and I would always try to reply and be like. I understand that things take time, I just want to know if there's something I'm missing, or that I should have gave you. Every month, I would write it through SBA, and I would never get a response until 3 days ago that I got the letter. So, that was really upsetting.

Researcher: And I'm sorry you had that experience.

P1: Hmm.

Researcher: Yeah, I guess, have you contacted VA? Sorry, you were talking about using AskVA. Maybe, can you tell me a little bit more about your experience with AskVA?

P1: In general? With the VR I need, that was actually my second time having to use SBA, before any of my education benefits. When I applied for, my… Disability rating. I had gone through a VSO the first time, and…I had never received any update after doing it with my VSO before I left service.And… I spent many days on AskVA, going back and forth with someone to find out that the VSO had never actually filed it. It's already out of service, which means it wouldn't be able to do the… I don't remember what it's called, but it's like the expedited claim for active duty service members. Now I have to have a regular claim, which means I had to start from scratch, because they said they didn't have any of…my files, but I was able to get all that information through AskVA. It wasn't, like, an instant chat, you know, it's kind of more similar to, like, an email. But over the course of a couple days, I was able to get to that conclusion that…you know, I just didn't have a case at all.

Researcher: Okay. So, if you think over, maybe, let's say over the course of the last 6 months, how frequently are you using AskVA?

P1: The last 6 months, I think I've… I've used it, like, 4 times, but… AskVA is kind of confusing to me, or at least the way it was where they send you an email telling you that your counselor has reached out to you through AskVA, can reply, but I can't, like, just continue accessing AskVA. Like, I can't just reply… To that email, and then go back and be like, let me look through. ask via and, like, see other messages, because I know, with the…with my claim stuff, that I have used it before, but I can't access that.

Researcher: Okay. Yeah, we might get… that's… that's really good context to kind of your experience overall, so I appreciate you kind of walking me through that. I might dig into some of those things, a little bit, a little bit further along, as we go through the session, so…Okay, so I am going to move us into kind of the next part of this session, and I'm going to provide you with some different scenarios and tasks, but I'm going to have you first start by sharing your screen with us. So you should be able to do that with a green share button that's kind of a square with an arrow in it at the bottom of the Zoom window. Okay. I can see your screen now, and I am going to send you, a link, an email address, and a password to use, to kind of log in to AskVA. And so you'll be logging in through ID.me. And once you get through all of the login screens, I'll kind of prompt you with a scenario then. And kind of talk out loud. This will be kind of our first, practice at this, like, talk out loud as to what you're seeing, what you're reading, and what it might mean to you.

P1: Might even bother reading. Okay, let me go back. Sorry, the Zoom stuff has kind of been…

Researcher: Oh, okay, is it kind of in your way?

P1: Let me just readjust everything. Okay.

Researcher: Okay.

P1: Okay, so we're on the Ask VA page. I didn't know they had a page for it. Get answers and questions, you should receive a fine between… within 7 business days. For the claim, that was true. For VRNA, I never actually got a response. So I'm gonna sign in now. I think you said ID.me. And password…I'm…

Researcher: I think it's… I think if you, there is kind of a bar over that, yeah, I think if you hit one of those, then you should be able to…So, as that's kind of getting you logged in, I wanted you to imagine that you're having an issue with your work-study benefits, and you've been directed to ask VA to get help with that issue. Before you click on anything to complete this task, take a second to look around and talk out loud about what it is that you're seeing here.

P1: Well, I am on the… Still on the Ask VA page… Get answers… 7 business days, 2 to 5… 15 minutes. It's kind of long. Can use it to ask a question online, education, disability, healthcare, and many other topics. Mmm… He talks about, like, if it's more urgent. Okay.

Researcher: So, I know you said, kind of in the beginning, that you have used AskVA before. When we came to this page, I think I might have also heard you say something like, I didn't know that there was a page for this. I'm kind of curious, what your expectations were, in, like, when you thought about AskVA.

P1: I don't really know what my expectations were. It feels like, there's some stuff, like, on the VA page where most people would know that it's there, and it's easy to find, like, the different phone numbers that you can call are usually on several different pages, but I feel like AskVA is kind of more of a… You have to know that you want to use it to use it.

Researcher: Hmm.

P1: Like, I don't remember ever landing on the page, I think it was, like going… trying to find a number, and I ended up on, like, a general contact page, and from there, I was able to use it.

Researcher: Okay. Is there any other way that you've, tried to access AskVA in the past?

P1: No, because most of the time it was, me getting the email notification that I had been reached out to through AskVA.

Researcher: Okay. So now I wanted you to go ahead and show us how you would use AskVA to get help with your work-study benefits.

P1: Okay, so I'm Frank Arnold. I know the VA… I actually like that the VA site tries to pre-fill your information. I would choose this one. Yeah, nothing else. Choose this category… Select a topic that best describes. I would click Work Study.

Researcher: What, kind of going back to that last list really quick, kind of were looking through it, I'm curious what this list means to you.

P1: Mmm…I don't know if it means anything, but it does tell me that it covers more under the umbrella topic. A lot of these are things that I'm not really sure what would mean, like compliance surveys. I know some of this is more for… Active duty service members, or I guess reservists that use EA. Hmm. Yeah, it's more… expansive than I had expected when I clicked on it.

Researcher: Okay. And how important do you think these, like, the previous lists and this list are for your question?

P1: Crucial. So far, we're still following along. My work-study question. I like the style of it, I think it's user-friendly. I think it's good to have a… I don't know what the word is for these, like, is it flowchart? No, where it's like, yes, no. If it's yes, you go here. If it's no, you go here. It just keeps taking you down and down. I… I like that. I think it's…  It's a good way to make sure that people aren't struggling to use your products.

Researcher: And what would you do if you couldn't find an option that made sense for your particular question?

P1: Let me see… First, I would probably work backwards and see if I'm just, you know, I just didn't read carefully. I see that they don't have an other option. That would… I don't know how I feel about that. sometimes people have issues, but they don't necessarily know what it falls under, so I think there should be an option of other, or either just, like. Being able to just type out, like, what your issue is. If you are unable to find it.

Researcher: Have you ever had that experience with AskVA before?

P1: No. No. Because I think it does a pretty good job of categorizing everything. Okay. if I wasn't, like. if it was just me on my own, for example, and I, for some reason, could not find it, then I would fear that Putting it in "other" would make… would take longer to get a response. Excuse me, I'm not sure how it goes on the other side. I don't know how they filter, you know, the…the messages that come in. I don't know if some people are, like, in charge of education benefits, someone else does healthcare. So if, for some reason I couldn't find my topic at all, I would just call. I would just call to ensure that I get an answer, due to having a mixed experience with SBA.

Researcher: Okay.

P1: So, I would click Education, Work Study. I'm not really sure what my question is, but I would probably just do a general question. If I'd had issues with my work study, Amen. I would be the veteran. And I know other people could fill it out for you. I live in Maryland, so I just thought that would be easier.

Researcher: Okay.

P1: Right, your school's game, you have a school scheme, and your residency. Yeah, so far, there's nothing, difficult. Just a question. Assuming I know what the topic was about. Or… issue on… work studying.

Researcher: And maybe, maybe you could think to a previous time when you've used this tool, what was maybe an issue that you would have, put in here?

P1: Being this, ability, claim, Missing documents. That was how I originally found out about it.is… I…don't remember the timeline, but I think they said, like, once your file is filed with, the disability claim it should take between 30 to 60 days to populate onto the website. And I made an account, and I remember it was closer to the 3-4 month mark, and I didn't see anything. had called, and the first person I had called was not that helpful, but they had said that maybe my documents are missing, and I was like, okay, I don't want to get on a call again. I want to use Ask VA, and I remember reaching out. I don't remember what exactly I said, but I think I usually start with, like you know, I filed… my claim with the VSO on… on this date. The VSO had actually given me, like, a claim number. Which, I don't know where she could have gotten it from, but claim number, so-and-so. Oh, they usually use your last four, I remember now. So, claim number, last four of your social, and… spoke with VA Representative on dates. was… told that documents… May have not been Properly filed under my claim number. And, you know, basically asking if it would work for them to find said documents. That's how I would go.

Researcher: how… How do you determine what to fill into the subject versus the question?

P1: I mean, the subject shouldn't be long. But… I want to at least make clear what the category is. You know? We… we went through different, flow chart, but if we had gone through the healthcare, I would probably just copy whatever the topic was that got me to this. with, like, missing documents on it. Like, if it was healthcare benefits, then I'd probably put that.

Researcher: Hmm.

P1: Missing claim documents.

Researcher: Okay. And can you describe a time where you might want to attach something with your question?

P1: I think if, for example… it's something related to education benefits, and you've already used them. I, for example, have kept all of my papers that I've gotten through the VA, because they always send mail of, like, for this semester, this is your benefits that you're getting. And let's say, I received an erroneous amount, or…It was higher, too low than I would… Probably scan that document and attach it to show, like, this is the, you know, notification I had received at this date, of this amount.

Researcher: Yeah.

P1: Mmm… I don't know if we're going back to the… What's the thing? Question. Whatever question I would have, I… I think the more information, the better to give, especially because this isn't an immediate response, so… You know, it might… you have to wait a couple days, you might have to wait a couple days, And I think in order to…try to make sure that it doesn't take as long. I think it's important to just be… to front-load, you know, everything that you know.

Researcher: Okay.

P1: So I would, you know… just to fill out as much as I can, and I try to give dates, with this, I didn't have a document, but if I had something that said, you know. your file was claimed on this date. I would have attached it, and then… Continue. Hmm… everything. Yeah, everything looks good to me, and then I probably submit.

Researcher: Okay. So, on a scale from 1 to 5, 1 being very difficult and 5 being very easy, how easy or difficult was it for you to complete this task?

P1: I would say a 5.

Researcher: Okay. And on a scale from 1 to 5, how satisfied are you with this process? Again, 1 being very unsatisfied, and 5 being very satisfied.

P1: I would say 4.

Researcher: Can you expand on that a little bit more?

P1: Mainly just, there's no option for, you know, anything that falls outside of the topics. Which, I think the chance of something not belonging to one of the topics is actually very slim. But, I'm thinking about… Other people that might use the site. You know, some people don't read as carefully and stuff, so…

Researcher: Okay. Now, what would you do next after submitting your question here?

P1: Remember earlier they had said that, it can take up to 7 business days, so I'd probably put a reminder on my calendar of, like, the latest I should be receiving something receiving something by. I probably make sure all my contact information is up to date, now that I know that SBA will notify you through email or text if you receive, something. I'd also probably write down my confirmation number.

Researcher: And what would you expect AskVA to do next?

P1: Give me a response. Well, if it's on my work-study because I don't really know what the question is, I guess it would depend on what I asked. My missing documents. I don't expect them to solve the situation, because it isn't… you know, if there's no claim, there's not really much else they can do for me, but what I need to know is whether or not the documents are even in the database, so that would be the question I need answered. Is, are… are my documents there? If they are, can they be attached to my claim? If they aren't there. Then my follow-up would be, is there a claim at all for me? That's what I would, most likely expect.

Researcher: Okay. Great. Well, thank you for walking through that first task. I'm gonna move us on to our second task, and I do have, a new… basically the same link, but I'm gonna have you log in with a new email and password, so I think you should be If you click on that link, I think you'll have to log in again. Okay, if that's not the case, I'm gonna have you actually log out, so you can go to Frank at the top and sign out.And then… now go to the link that I… yeah, that… Yeah, perfect. And then use that email address and password again to log back in. All right, so now imagine that it's been maybe a month since you submitted that question, and in that time you've submitted other questions through AskVA, you now want to go back to see that question that you asked about your work-study benefits. Show us how you would check on that question.

P1: Mmm… okay. Let me just look…Okay, so this is back about my work study. This one's the only one of the same topic. Haven't received my compensation, when can I expect to receive it? Let's see…I'm really excited, I just never got a response. Or, I haven't gotten a response, I guess.

Researcher: So, what attributes of your previous question are you looking for?

P1: What attributes?

Researcher: Yeah. What are you using to find your previous question?

P1: Work study, is the words. I know it has something to do with education benefits and everything else was related to healthcare. So that's, how I found it and received compensation for my VMware setting. This question doesn't provide nearly enough information, which I don't like, but… That's on a road for some reason, I…Okay, I'm to ignore this date, correct? Because if it's only a week, I wouldn't be sending another message already. Even if it says 7 days.

Researcher: Yeah.

P1: This day's… And I usually double any time if it's under a month. Because…where I'm at in the National Capital Region, we have been told that, like, they have the most amount of veterans to provide service. And so… delays Expected. But assuming that it's been, like, a month, let's say, it's been a month and I haven't gotten a response, I would probably… reiterate what I said with more information of, like. I'm not sure how work-study programs work either, but I started…Circling back to, you know, previous request. I started my work-study program on date with an expected compensation amount of… if I know, Amount. And as of… whatever date I first realized that I hadn't been paid.

Researcher: Okay.

P1: There has been… you know, update… And… I'm reaching out to see… I usually take the perspective of, like, maybe I didn't do something.

Researcher: Hmm.

P1: I don't think it's useful to be…Upset or accusatory when you are reaching out to customer service in general, even if by this point I might be miffed if it's been a month and I still don't know where my compensation is. It's reasonable to be upset, but… That doesn't really help me get what I need.

Researcher: Okay.

P1: It is any documentation I need to provide? To expedite this process. Is, most likely what I would say. If I have any, like, mail, like, from the VA. VA sends mail for everything, like, confirmation that you enrolled into something, or that you are eligible for something. So if I had that, I would also, upload it. Like, anything… anything related to my work study, I would upload the documents for.

Researcher: Okay.

P1: And that's… I would… I would send that.

Researcher: Yeah, thanks for walking me through your whole thought process there, that's really… that's really helpful. I wanted to go… go back one page, to kind of where you originally landed, to look for this question. You kind of walked through this pretty quickly, and I know you said you were looking at… looking for education, something related to work study. What information of the things that you see here is most important to you?

P1: The category?

Researcher: Okay.

P1: I think. That's just what my eyes gravitate towards. I'm not gonna remember, you know, individual reference numbers.

Researcher: Is there anything else that would be helpful to help you find your previous question?

P1: I mean, the blurb is… the dates don't really matter either, because I see there's multiple same-date questions, I can't base myself off of that. But category is the shortest thing that I can read, so it's the fastest way to look at. ou know, I already know it's about work-study, which is under my education, that's why I just… Went through really fast, just by category.

Researcher: Crem. And what order are you seeing the questions in?

P1: I'm assuming from most recently submitted to latest?

Researcher: Is that how you would like to see them in? Is that how you would expect to see them in?

P1: Yes, and then I would expect In Progress to be first. I don't know what the different, like, little banner options are. Like, if I get a response, would it still be in progress? But… in progress, anything that's being worked on currently should be first, and then anything that's completed, I would like to be right after. I think that makes sense.

Researcher: Okay.

P1: Or… I think the first, first thing should be any drafts that I saved. I saw that that was an option to, like, finish your question later, so I'm assuming you… drafts?

Researcher: Okay. And I did want to probe a little bit into something you were talking about at the very beginning. You kind of mentioned that like, you couldn't find something that you had maybe submitted, or it was no longer there. I'm curious if you could kind of talk me through a little bit more in the context of what we're seeing here, what… what happened.

P1: I'm not sure when ASBA came to look like this, but when I used ASBA, it was, like, a separate page. the main VA… Like, this is still the main VA site. But the SBA that I used was a completely different site.

Researcher: Hmm. Okay.

P1: That didn't have all… like, none of this is… is familiar to me.

Researcher: Okay.

P1: Because… A while ago now.

Researcher: Okay. Is there anything, when looking at, kind of reviewing a previous question, is there anything that you really liked about How you could review things.

P1: There's nothing I dislike, I just… perhaps because we don't have a prototype that shows a response, but… I would like, it doesn't have to be anything big, but maybe, like, a… circle, I don't know what they call it in, like, any kind of messaging chat. They usually have, like, a circle of self-swords, like a green… Thing that lets you know that somebody has replied.

Researcher: Hmm.

P1: But I like the way that the information's given to us, it makes it easy to look through everything. My only thing would just be, like, I would like to, from the previous page, be able to see, like, okay, of all of these that I have in progress, this one has received, you know, a message that I haven't read, or gotten a response. But I like the way… I like the information. I feel like it's given me everything I need. Excuse me?

Researcher: Okay.

P1: In a… in an easy-to-read format.

Researcher: Okay. So, at this point, I'm actually going to be asking you to complete some of these same tasks in a slightly different system. So some things may look very similar to what you've just seen, while others may be completely different. We're kind of trying to understand which experience you prefer overall. So with that, I am going to provide you another link… And I will put that in the chat. And then I'll kind of prompt you with, a similar scenario that we did before. Okay, so just as we did before, I want you to imagine you're having issues with your work-study benefits. You've been directed to AskVA to get help with your issue, so show us again how you would use AskVA to get the help you need.

P1: Okay, so I'm on the page. I am John Smith. It has some of my information. Okay, all right.

Researcher: Yeah, so in this, in this version, you can't necessarily type in, so kind of talk me through, what you're seeing here, and maybe just a little bit of describing your reaction to it so far.

P1: I think because of the order we did it in, I'm not a fan of this already, but I don't know how far we are in the form. So, here, my question is first. I haven't paid for the hours I worked through the work-study program, can I get a status when I might receive them? I would add more information, but… Okay. I don't know how I feel about working backwards. This… It feels like it's working backwards. But I would go… Okay. I would look more carefully through the topics, Asian Work Study, It's still work study… Subtopic… Hmm… I think it's still a general question. Same as before, anything I have related to my work study, like, confirming that I was… You know, good to go on it. Any and all documents that further support. you know, I was working from this state to this state, I would add. Did I go back? Okay. It's being weird, but I would assume.

Researcher: So, go ahead and, maybe talk me through… you did talk through submitting an attachment, so, maybe go ahead and actually click to attach something here.

P1: Okay, so I would attach something. What is my relationship? I'm filling out for myself. Okay. And… Okay, this is, like, working completely backwards. I prefer the first way. Because… I think I spoke earlier, the way I would title my subject, and kind of the way I would fill out my question, is dependent on how they organize their topics and subtopics.

Researcher: Hmm.

P1: Yeah, it just didn't feel… Intuitive to work, with question first. And there's still no option of other, but I would fill out everything, and then… Submit. Same as before, I would put a calendar reminder Within 7 business days. To re-apply, you'll need to sign into VA.gov. If we need more information, we'll contact you.

Researcher: So, again, thinking about going through this, submitting a new question, on a scale from 1 to 5, how easy or difficult was it for you to complete this task? Again, 1 being very difficult, and 5 being very easy.

P1: Mmm, I use 5.

Researcher: Okay, can you expand on that a little bit more?

P1: I mean, it wasn't anything different than the original, it was more so the order of… Order of tasks. But… I think the first way kind of helps guide you And can possibly help you figure out better, like, how to… how to word your question to get the most, useful answer, I would say.

Researcher: Okay. And on a scale from 1 to 5, how satisfied were you with this process? So, 1 being very unsatisfied, and 5 being very satisfied.

P1: 4… like, even if I wasn't familiar with the other way, it would kind of throw me off guard to, like. I don't know if it's, like, a mental thing, but to me, like, if I'm already filling out my question, there shouldn't be more after. Like, by the time I'm typing it, my brain is already ready, like, okay, once I'm done with this, I press the blue button, and it should submit. So to ask me afterwards kind of feels off. Okay.

Researcher: Awesome. Thanks for providing that insight. Alright, we've got one more task, and with that task, we've got one more link for you. So I will have you go ahead and open up this last link. And again, I want you to imagine that maybe it's been a month since you submitted that particular question, and in that time you've maybe submitted other questions, but you now want to go back to that specific question about your work-study benefits. Show us how you would check on that question. So talk me through what you're seeing here.

P1: Okay, the layout is a little different, but I am looking at my questions. I already know it's the first one, but I'm gonna take a look through. I like the addition of the status, I think. That's helpful. I don't know how I feel about it being displayed as, like, a list, but here I can see… Of the ones I'm able to see. This is the only one that has education, and I see work study, so it's most likely this one. Oh my god.

Researcher: And how did you know, you said, I already know it's the first one, how did you know that, just upon looking at it for the first time?

P1: I'm always looking for the words work-study.

Researcher: Okay.

P1: Mmm.

Researcher: Where did you see the… the word work study on there? Sorry, just to bring us back.

P1: Okay. Huh.

Researcher: I think you might be able to hit the back button on your browser. Go back a page.

P1: Okay, okay.

Researcher: Right here in part of the question.

P1: Been able to see it, though, it actually might have been a bit of a pain to look for it. assuming that, like, it says here I have 9 results, so if I had other education questions, I would have to click through Or maybe if I remember when I submitted it, I could, you know, deduce, okay. my education question was more recent, so it has to be this one. I don't… Like, the way this is organized, though? I like the status, I think. status was the one thing I was saying for the first one.

Researcher: Hmm.

P1: This one kind of… like, I don't know what this category is. I don't know if it was the other option, or you fill in what it is, but… It feels… too wordy, or it kind of feels like I have to read through a lot to get to where I need to be. But… okay, so I've got my question, haven't been paid for my hours? Okay. So… Mmm, okay, so it… Mmm… I like that it shows the back and forth. I wish it was kind of labeled differently. I think the, the, like, from the VA to the VA, I wish it was just you and VA representative or something.

Researcher: Hmm.

P1: It looks like your records have found an option that might be better than the ones I sent over previously. If you have any questions, happy to jump on a call and discuss. We can make an appointment, we can talk about them then. Want to know if I can get an update, but okay, okay, good. Mmm… I would have to see what he originally said, because I'm not necessarily excited about moving the method of communication. If I'm using SVA, there has to be a particular reason why I'm doing that versus getting on a call.

Researcher: Okay.

P1: So…

Researcher: And for you, what might that reason be?

P1: The reason why I had switched in my previous claims was because I was actually in the process of moving from overseas back home, so… I, you know, didn't necessarily have the time or the cell service to get on a phone call, but I can get emails during the couple of days that it takes from, you know, getting back home home.

Researcher: Yeah.

P1: Or, you know, for anyone else that might have speech issues, it's just easier. They might have hearing problems, like, there might be a variety of reasons, but this isn't a critique on the actual Page. So, I will leave that being.

Researcher: So, if we go back again, I wanted to kind of tug on some of the things that you talked about here. So you liked the status, is there anything else, any other information that would be helpful to see here?

P1: If it was displayed… like, all the information is good, I just… the way it is displayed, it… it also doesn't… I feel like it doesn't necessarily match the way that the VA site does everything else.

Researcher: Can you speak a little bit more about that?

P1: Going back to the first… the first, method that we had used. That seems more in line with how the VA tends to present things, like when you, when you fill out, like, a claim, or when you're checking all claims and appeals, it kind of looks more similar to the first page, so maybe that's just what I'm used to.

Researcher: Okay.

P1: I, myself, can event… I can find my information here. But if everything else is kind of more succinct on this website, this would kind of throw me off. I guess I'd have to make more use of, like, the search function. That would probably be the easiest, versus trying to sit here and read through everything, which is what I did for the original method, because it's kind of displayed in, like, little boxes, so it's easier to look through real fast, but…

Researcher: And what might you search for here, if you were to use the search?

P1: Work study. would… would probably be my best bet to get what I need.

Researcher: Okay.

P1: But… Yeah, I really like the status, because that was my main thing of last time.

Researcher: And what order are you seeing things in here?

P1: I think it's by… Date submitted. I'm sure these are… they're not true, so I'm not sure when… the last updated actually would be, but I'm assuming it's by date submitted.

Researcher: And what order would you like to see these in?

P1: I guess as well, by… Mmm… Hmm… I think for this, like, the way they have it right here, I think it would make more sense by status?

Researcher: Hmm.

P1: Because the assumption is that new messages most likely have to do with your most recent. submission. Or submissions, let's say. So I think if they're gonna keep it like this, it would make more sense by status.

Researcher: And what do you think would be the highest status that you would want to see?

P1: reply. Like, in progress, you have a reply.

Researcher: Okay.

P1: But I don't know how the other ones would go. Soft would be last. And then… With these, like, new and reopened, it would have to go by date submitted. But now all of it is just getting more complicated.

Researcher: Okay. Well, having looked at this, overall, just curious, if there was anything in particular that you liked and didn't like about, reviewing your questions this way.

P1: Status. Status is cool. I like the inclusion of this… Of the inbox, because that was my main, That was my main gripe with, my previous experiences in general, is not being able to see my inbox. So I think that's cool. It provides more information overall, I think, once you click on your question, than the first method, which I like. But I just wish that the way that the information was displayed was a little different.

Researcher: Okay. Yeah, is there anything more specific that you wanted to call out there, of what you didn't like, of how it was displayed?

P1: I… it just feels… it feels wordy with… the inclusion of the questions, and the fact that I can't see the entire name of the category, I think, is what's, kind of messing with me. The reason I was able to look quickly on the first method is because you know, I was able to see, okay, education benefits here, healthcare compensation here. here, so I know I'm in education, and boom, I see work study, I know that that's what I'm looking for. But here, like, I don't like the fact that I don't know what this category is.

Researcher: Okay.

P1: And, you know, that they're kind of incomplete, so… not a fan of that. And I think that's why it makes everything feel more wordy, because I have to read through the whole question. Due to the fact that some of these categories I can't see. I hope that makes sense.

Researcher: Okay. Yeah, that's really helpful. And that actually closes out, like, our fourth and final task. I had just, a couple additional questions, to just kind of confirm your thoughts and your feedback on things, and I'm actually… I'm gonna go ahead and steal the share, And I'm gonna share my screen really quick. To ask some of these final questions.

P1: Sorry.

Researcher: Okay, so can you see my screen okay?

P1: Yes.

Researcher: Okay, great. So… as I mentioned, you saw two different versions of Ask VA today. So thinking first about submitting a question, I would love to to understand which one you preferred. So, on the left side was the first one that you experienced, and on the right-hand side is kind of just representative of the second one that you experienced. So which, which, did you prefer?

P1: The first one, or the one on the left.

Researcher: Okay. And then, I'll go ahead and do… we've got one more. Here, similar question, but thinking about when you were looking at a previous question. So again, the one on the left is the first one that you saw, and the one on the right is the second one that you saw. So which one did you prefer overall?

P1: I think I still prefer the one on the left as well.

Researcher: Okay. And I guess for both of those, options that you chose, can you talk me through anything else that you'd like to add about why you chose those two versions?

P1: I think it just makes more sense with how the VA site is run in general. There's… Things of the second one that I liked. that I would like to see incorporated into the first one. Like I mentioned before, like, the status thing, It's probably my biggest one, and what information is given when you actually go into your individual Question submission. from the prototype, I think, would really work in the first method. I forgot what the question was, I'm so sorry.

Researcher: No, that definitely gives some context as to why you chose the preferences that you did. And we do only have one more minute, so I will go ahead and close this out. So, let me stop sharing really quick. I did want to kind of just circle back to reconfirm that you're still comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session. I just wanted to remind you, like, we remove all identifying information when we share these types of things internally, but I just wanted to confirm whether or not you would be comfortable if we shared a video clip in, like, reporting out on the type of research that we're doing.

P1: Yes, I'm okay with that.

Researcher: Okay. Well, thank you so much. Really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback was really helpful. The experience you've had with ASCBA in the past was also really great to learn from and understand. And lastly, Paragene will be sending you a thank you note, that you could also pass along to other veterans to let them know that they could also participate in future sessions like that, like we did today. So, just wanted to thank you for your time, and I hope that you have a great day. I guess, do you have any questions before we close out, though?

P1: No questions, Mayan. I appreciate, everything, and I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.

Researcher: Thank you. Bye.
