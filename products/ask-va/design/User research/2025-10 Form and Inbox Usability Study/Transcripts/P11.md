Researcher: Okay, so now that I have started recording, I wanted to confirm that you are okay with us using just the audio and the screen share of this session.

P11: I am.

Researcher: Okay. Great. Thank you so much for that, and kind of walking through all of the different expectations for this session. Before we go ahead and kind of kick things off, did you have any additional questions for me?

P11: I don't. Thanks for explaining everything.

Researcher: Okay.

P11: Great.

Researcher: So to kick us off, I wanted to, talk a little bit… you… In the initial survey, you mentioned that you do leverage the education and or training benefits that VA offers. Can you tell me a little bit more about how you've used those benefits?

P11: So, I am a mom to a freshman in college. And he just started his freshman year at UMD. And I was able to… apply for the Chapter 35 VA benefits for him to pay for his undergraduate education.

Researcher: Okay. And have you experienced any challenges related to receiving these VA benefits?

P11: Absolutely. Well, first of all, when I was applying the website was not very clear when it said to put in the applicant information initially. I put in my information because I thought I was the applicant using my benefits on him. And then when I went through the whole thing, it… turns out I did that incorrectly, and so I had to reapply with my son's information, And then… put my information in the background. So it was just not clear, like, who the applicant should have been. So that kind of slowed down the application process to begin with. And then, once I submitted it, I… like, there was no… confirmation that my… my application was received. There was just a lot of… blank space where, well, did they get my application? Did they not? Do I… and then… So, eventually, I received something in the mail, like, months later. Good thing I started the process early. stating that my application was incomplete. That's when I knew that my initial application with my information was not sufficient, so then I had to go back and reapply the second time using my son's information. It was just… there was a lot of things that are unclear, and I would say I'm pretty savvy, I'm a doctor, and I was an administrator for TRICARE Dental, you know, for the Navy. And a program manager as well, so… I feel like I'm… not that I'm a super user, but I'm pretty savvy with applications and things like that, but it was just so unclear. So, I think that they could do better with that, as far as, like, whose information they want. You know, and maybe just… notifying the veteran along the way, hey, we've received your application, or some kind of, you know, like, even Domino's has a thing that says, oh, we've received your order, this is in progress, this is… just something along the lines so we know, so we're not in this… and I… and I know things move slow with the government, so I wasn't in a hurry to call every week and check on my status, but… It would… just be nice for the veteran to have some transparency, so that… you know, I always hear veterans complain about the military and the VA, and that they want to jip us out of our benefits, this and that, but… and I don't see that as a… as a thing, and I always try to defend it, but it's hard to defend when there's no transparency in the application process.

Researcher: Yeah. So, during, like, that particular experience, or any other experience, I guess, either, like, say in the last 6 months, have you contacted VA for any kind of support?

P11: So, I… I found out that I had to go through UMD as well, so we did… we were… we were contacting UMD because there's no way of… us verifying our eligibility without the school getting involved. So the school, luckily, University of Maryland has a special office that deals directly with the VA, so they do the certification process. So, I will tell you, I got my application in in July. Okay, my son starts school in September, and I knew I wouldn't receive benefits till October, a month… after he starts, because I've, you know, researched stuff online, so I wasn't expecting the money. But come October 20… like, 5th or 6th, I still haven't received anything. that's when I kind of pushed my son to, like, hey, you need to contact your VA office at school, what's going on? We haven't heard any… you know. So here's… I'm glad we're doing this survey now, because I got the confirmation October 29th by mail. that they… reviewed and approved my application October 17, 3 months later! So, of course. you know, I… they were good about it. You know, the way this works is that, I guess, they pay you monthly after you've paid the… I don't know if you're familiar with this. Are… am I… do you know about the tuition?

Researcher: Generally, yes, at a high level.

P11: Yeah, so they… If you want to talk a little bit about it, that's cool. The nitty-gritty is they… you pay it first, and then they reimburse you on a monthly basis.

Researcher: Hmm, yeah.

P11: So… Because the application approval came October 29th for the 17th approval of October. I got both the September 30th payment and the October 30th payment at the same time, which is great. Long story short, it finally happened, but, you know, for I would say 3 months we were in the dark, not knowing if the application was even approved. I was… if I needed to even submit more stuff to the UMD office. And then, of course, my son finally got ahold of them, and they're like, oh, don't worry, we've heard from other applicants that the VA was taking a long time reviewing these applications and approval. And to me, it should be pretty seamless. One, you check that my son is an eligible beneficiary, which is all over the place. You know, it's all over my profile. I have a son, right? So that should be an easy check-off. And then the second check-off is the school mailed in his confirmation for enrollment back in August. So that should be an easy check-off, right? To me, there's only two criteria here. One, he's qualified. Two, he's enrolled, but I don't know why that takes 3 months to check off, you know? So just things like that, it just seems maybe they're understaffed, or… I don't know, it just seems like even… even an IA computer could just look over this paperwork and be like, oh yeah, check, check. You know, the first criteria is super easy, he's my dependent. You know, he's been my dependent for 18 years. There should be no question he's my son, right? And then I have the benefits, that should be easily checked off in my profile. And then the last thing is just a letter from the school, which was mailed in in August. We got confirmation from the school. So that… just things like that have been, you know, challenging.

Researcher: Yeah, no, I appreciate you providing some context and some just additional description of what you've experienced in this process. I should have one more question before we kind of dive into the prototype that we're going to look at. Have you ever used a tool called AskVA?

P11: Not specifically. I've gone to the FAQs, and I've gone into the mobile site, and I have the app on my phone, but I don't… not specifically ask VA, no.

Researcher: Okay. Okay. So, I wanted to move then into the next part of our session, and I'm going to be providing you with some different scenarios and tasks, but first I wanted you to start by sharing your screen with us. So, that should be at the bottom of your Zoom window. It's a green with an arrow in it. So I'll have you start by sharing your screen, and then I'll be sending a link, and we'll be kind of working out of a browser, so if you're able to go back to the Zoom window and click on that link, then I'll be able to kind of give you a scenario, that we can walk through.

P11: So, I shared my screen, I think.

Researcher: Yep, yep, I can see your screen.

P11: How do I go back?

Researcher: Yeah, so you should be able to go back into the Zoom, application, so you see…

P11: Zoom.

Researcher: Okay, so then in the chat… Yeah, there's a little chat window you might have to click into it, I think at the bottom.

P11: Link 1?

Researcher: Yep, so link 1, if you go ahead and click on that, it should open up in your browser. Yep, and I see it opening up now. So, I want you to imagine that you've logged into your VA.gov account.

P11: Hmm.

Researcher: You're having an issue with your work-study benefits. You've been directed to ask VA to get help with this issue. Now, before you click on anything to complete this task, take a second to look around and talk out loud about what it is that you're seeing.

P11: I see it says Ask VA. you can pre-fill some of your information, and then the green is pretty obvious, ask a new question, and I guess that's where I would ask… I would click to ask a question.

Researcher: Okay, so having seen this, what are your expectations from AskVA?

P11: I'm expecting either a live chat or some pre… formed answers. if… The robot, or… Somebody in the background can read my question and just have some either standard questions, like, live chat would be pretty cool, but I don't… I don't know. I don't have any expectation at this point.

Researcher: Okay. And how long would you expect it to get help through AskVA?

P11: If it's a live chat, I would expect immediate resolution or answers.

Researcher: If it's…

P11: something like an FAQ, then I don't know. I mean, it'd be pretty antiquated, but I would… So if it's a live chat, my expectation is hopefully it'll get resolved on the spot.

Researcher: Okay. Now, go ahead.

P11: But here it says… but here it says 7 business days, which… so that just means that I guess it's not going to be a live chat.

Researcher: Okay What does that 7 business days mean to you?

P11: 7 working business days, not weekends or holidays.

Researcher: Okay. So, go ahead now and show us how you would use AskVA to get help.

P11: Yay. I clicked on Ask a Question, it looks like it's gonna pre-fill some of my information, right? Assuming I'm John Smith. And I would continue. And I would put my question in here.

Researcher: Yeah, so you can't necessarily type in this particular prototype, so what's something you might want to put into this field?

P11: Well, and if I had not received the letter on October 29th, I would have said, I would put in the details of me applying for my son's education benefit back in July, we've submitted You know, the schools… Record. We just need to know… where we are in the process of being approved, and if I was approved, I should have already received my payment. as of September 30th, but I don't see any payment. You know, I would, you know, please update me on the process, and if I need to resubmit any paperwork, like, what is missing? That's what I would say, something along that line.

Researcher: Okay. So, here you can go ahead and click into the question box, and kind of just imagining the scenario that we were walking through. Continue to, kind of seek out the help you needed for a work-study benefit issue.

P11: Okay, so they… I type my question, and then I would just continue to submit it. And then I would select here on what the topic would… Looks like it would be Education, Benefit, and Work Studies, the first one. So, I would click on that, and then… Select continue. Oh, the topic.

Researcher: So talk me through what you're thinking as you review this list.

P11: I don't see spec- oh, there it is, work study. I mean, I guess these are all the different types of education benefits? I'm not familiar with the work-study, but I guess in this case, work-study seems to apply the most.

Researcher: And when you read through this list, kind of tell me how you're interpreting it. What do they mean to you?

P11: It sounds like there's various types of education benefits, because that was the big topic I selected, and they just want to hone in on Specifically, which type of benefit I was inquiring about. In this case, it's the work-study one. with my example, I guess I would select the… Benefits for survivor independence.

Researcher: Hmm. Okay. And how important do you see these questions, like this one and the previous question we were looking at?

P11: I mean, if there's a specific department or personnel that is answering these questions, I think this is important to help Filter the questions to the right person to respond. I don't… I mean, I just don't know the hierarchy or, like, how the department is broken up in the VA, so I don't know if all this is necessary. I don't… I mean, if the VA feels like they need to break it down to filter the question to the right department or personnel, then I guess it's useful. It's just a lot for some people, maybe? It's just a lot. But, I mean… Maybe it's necessary.

Researcher: Okay. And what would you do if you couldn't find an option that fit your needs?

P11: I would go back… And see if something else… did I miss something here? I would look… oh, I can't even do that. I would try to click on here and see, maybe I missed some… another category. I would hope, typically, if there's that many options, they would have another one and then allow me to type something, but… I mean, if you already have close to 20 options there, what's the 21st option? You know, other… But, I mean, there's just a lot here. That's great that we have all these benefits. I'm not familiar with some of these.

Researcher: Okay. Yeah, any other thoughts on… on this list?

P11: Nope. It just works out for this example, both my example as well as the dummy question. has a… A topic link that applies, so it works out.

Researcher: Okay.

P11: So, application, general question, position, description, signed. Contract times… hmm. I guess this person wants to know where their application is. Like, the status of the application. Maybe it'd be helpful if it was application status. But it's not letting me click on it, it keeps saying general question. It's getting highlighted. It's weird. Am I supposed to click through this?

Researcher: Yeah, so I hear that you wanted to select the application option. Okay.

P11: But it won't let me. It's only letting me select general question.

Researcher: Yeah, so what does general question mean to you, then?

P11: it seems more vague, so it's odd that we filtered it down to work study, but then now it's a general question. I mean, I guess other? It applies to other, I suppose, if none of those topics apply.

Researcher: Okay.

P11: Should I move on.

Researcher: Yeah.

P11: I like this. Attach your document thing, that's great. Will it allow me to upload more than one, or just one?

Researcher: How many attachments, would you like to upload to something like this?

P11: Oh, I guess it just depends on what the VA requirements are, right? So, every application has different requirements. Like, in the case of my son's application, I would have to maybe upload his birth certificate to prove that he's my dependent, his college enrollment, that's two… And then maybe the third one would be my… disability eligibility, but I mean, that seems silly, too, because the VA should know my eligibility. So, it just depends on what the application requires, right? So. Every education benefit has different requirements, like, different forms, so that… If that particular application requires 3 forms, then it should allow me to upload 3 things. Otherwise, I would have to merge some PDFs together to make it one attachment, and that could be very burdensome for some people who don't have Adobe. Or, you know, the technology to have the ability to merge multiple PDFs. Into one attachment. So, it should be able to allow me to attach multiple things.

Researcher: Okay.

P11: Should I continue?

Researcher: Yeah, and actually, go ahead and click into, as if you were going to attach something here.

P11: Okay.

Researcher: And you can continue, kind of, through the process here.

P11: Mmm… I mean, it looks like I already… there's a file here already that I… did I put this file there? Assuming I put a file there, right? I don't know what this is.

Researcher: Yeah, you can assume that the… the file was maybe… this is kind of for, like, the prototype.

P11: Okay, so I put my file there, and then this allows me to change it if I accidentally put in the wrong file. And this is drag an additional file. So this… it looks like it allows me to drag an additional file if I have more than one. So that's good. Okay. It's pretty standard. I'll continue. What is your relationship to the veteran? In this case, I'm the veteran. I would select that. Or… Okay. Oh, so see, here, this one has that… school certifying official, so I guess the… my son's college could click on that if they're the one attaching the files for the veteran. That's kind of neat, too.

Researcher: Yeah, and maybe on that point, the school certifying official, I'm curious, have… have you or your son interacted with them much, in this process that y'all have been going through?

P11: So my son has been emailing them when we initially applied. They were pretty good at responding via email, but every time I call, I have been… I've called them 4 times, and every time I call, I've gotten the machine. directing me to call somebody else, and then the other person would not be in the office, and I've left messages, and I've never received a callback. So, 4 calls, no callback, but email has been great. They have always responded to email. So…

Researcher: Yeah, I think that was the main question I was curious of, like, how are you interacting with them? So, it sounds like email is the primary form of communication.

P11: Right. For some reason, they're too busy to pick up the phone, or they don't like to talk. I know people like that, you know, some people just don't like to respond by phone, they'd just rather email you back. But then, that's troublesome, too, because we have some older folks who… Don't feel comfortable with email still? you know, I know as more generations retire. and get VA benefits, this will change, but there's still quite a bit of older Veterans, you know, in their 80s, 70s, 60s, who are not Computer capable yet.

Researcher: Yeah. Now, thanks for going into a little bit more detail, about those school certifying officials.

P11: So, here I could… I guess I could select the state… And then the residency, where I… Currently live, okay. Alright, it's not letting me select, so I'll just… Continue? Yes? Okay. It looks like here I'm allowed to put in my information, my email address, and my preferred name. Okay, pretty standard stuff. Okay, and this is allowing me to review my application. I'm, like, 98% done, that's pretty good. I like the little progress bar up top, that's nice. I'm just checking to make sure… I'm a veteran, there's my address, and then if I see that all the information is correct. I can submit the question, and it looks like it allows me to edit anything if something is wrong here, so that the edit bars are Very useful. Okay. That's it.

Researcher: Okay. So, on a scale from 1 to 5, how easy or difficult was it to complete this task? 1 being very difficult, and 5 being very easy.

P11: I would say 4. It was pretty easy.

Researcher: And on a scale from 1 to 5, how satisfied were you with this process? 1 being very unsatisfied, and 5 being very satisfied.

P11: I guess if I do receive an email within 7 business days, I would be very satisfied. If I don't, I would be very unsatisfied, and… That would require me to make a phone call, and that would be very annoying.

Researcher: Okay.

P11: So I guess it always… it all depends on the results, right?

Researcher: Hmm. If you had to rate your satisfaction, with just submitting your question. How might you rate it from 1 to 5?

P11: If I also get an email confirmation with this reference number and everything summarized in an email confirmation, I would be very satisfied. So, do I get that, or do I have to screenshot this to keep for my own record?

Researcher: Yeah, what would you expect to happen?

P11: I would expect an email confirmation. with everything I just submitted.

Researcher: Okay. And I wanted to maybe probe just for a second on… you did give this a 4 out of 5, and so I'm curious, if there was anything in particular that, maybe could have been easier for you on this process?

P11: Just… just where I got a little confused about with all those different education benefits, we zoned in on work-study, but there was not an And then the general question, there was no… I mean, it was just kind of unclear.

Researcher: I mean, I guess one of the things that…

P11: as far as I know, that always concerns the veteran is payment, right? Like, payment wasn't an option, and that was his question, like, when am I gonna get paid? And so that wasn't an option, but I tell you. I have a lot of veteran friends, and that's always the concern. When am I gonna get paid? But payment was not an option. Like, timeline of payment, or confirmation of… we just always just want some kind of confirmation that, hey, we got your application, it's just, please be patient for payment. Like, there's nothing that was related to that, and I just felt that was sort of incomplete.

Researcher: And how did you feel overall about the length of the form?

P11: I think it was appropriate.

Researcher: Okay. And what would you do next after you're submitting your question here?

P11: I would check to see if I got an email confirmation, I would probably set a calendar reminder for myself. If I don't hear back in 7 days, I would be very annoyed.

Researcher: What would you expect AskVA to do next?

P11: What would I expect? What, can you repeat that?

Researcher: What would you expect, AskVA to do next?

P11: I expect my question to be filtered into the correct department for whoever's handling this in the background to research my case. get me an answer and reply to me like they said they would. Or if I'm missing anything, right? Like, I attached a file. If my file was not what they needed to adjudicate it to me and just be like, hey, this is the wrong file, or we're still missing this information, XYZ. I would want some resolution, either, hey, we need more information, or you're good to go, please be patient, payment's on the way, there's a government shutdown, but don't worry, you'll get paid, you know, something along that line.

Researcher: Yeah. Okay. Any other thoughts on completing, the… submitting the question like you did here? Any other… Things that you liked or didn't like.

P11: A live chat would be really great, but I know, I know. funding, manpower, so, I mean, next to…

Researcher: Well, maybe I'll pull on that a little bit. What would, kind of, your expectations of a live chat be, or what would your, hope for a live chat be?

P11: I would hope that the person who's chatting with me would be able to pull up my application Live, like, what they have from me already. You know, hey, you're qualified for this program. I see that you're missing this document, or hey, I see that we received your school certification. You know, sorry… In my case, sorry, no one's reviewed your application yet. I mean, even though it's been 3 months, you know? Just, please be patient with us, but you're… we definitely have your stuff, it's just a matter of time, you know, like… and then I would just leave them alone, because I… I understand, you know, I was in the military for 24 years. They just take a long time sometimes. But eventually they'll get to it, but without even knowing that. I might be tempted to keep submitting questions and bothering someone, and then clog up the system, because I'm asking the same question 5 times. But if the live chat person's there saying, oh, no, we got everything, don't worry. It's just a matter of the review. you know, then I would back off, right? So, it just depends on… what the answer would be, but it'd be great if they had live answers. And I feel like… We have enough computer systems that that could work. Because I… I… So I work for the VA part-time right now, consulting, and I'm able to log on and check on certain patients' eligibility live.

Researcher: Hmm.

P11: You know, as far as on the healthcare side. So, with the benefits side, I kind of expect the same thing. You know, I mean…

Researcher: Credit.

P11: But I, I know this, this…

Researcher: It was interesting to hear, kind of, yeah, it was interesting to hear, kind of, your thoughts there, and what you would, like. What your hopes are for something like that.

P11: I know, I'm ambitious, right?

Researcher: Oh, it's great. It's great to understand your perspective there. I am going to keep moving us along.

P11: Okay.

Researcher: of time, and I actually have… I'm going to move us to our second task, so I've got another link for you in the chat, so if you're able to get back out to your Zoom window, into the chat there, there is a link, too, for you to click on, and I will kind of prompt you, with a new scenario there.

P11: I'm clicking on it, but nothing's happening.

Researcher: Oh, it's, yeah, it looks like it was… Taking a second and… Looks like it's loading now. So as that loads, again, imagine you've already logged into your VA.gov account, and maybe it's been a month since you submitted that question, and in that time, you might or might not have already submitted other questions, but you want to go back and check on your question about your work-study benefits. Show us how you would check on that question.

P11: Well, I can't see part of the screen because you're here. Let me see if I… can I minimize you?

Researcher: Yeah. Okay.

P11: I would look to see… oh, so I see here, this first one is where I submitted. I haven't been paid for the hours. I would view details. Status is still new. And my attachment looks like they're there. And… I looked at your record and found an option that might be better than the ones I sent over previously. If you have any questions, I'm happy to jump on a call and discuss, or you can make an appointment, we can talk about it then. Oh, I want to know if I can update about…

Researcher: So I'm actually gonna have you go back, one page, and that's where I'm gonna actually focus our questions on. So if you can go back, by the browser, yeah, you should be able to hit the back button in the browser.

P11: Okay.

Researcher: As you were reviewing things here, what attributes of your previous question are you looking for?

P11: What do you mean, what attributes about my previous question?

Researcher: Yeah, what are… when you would look for a question that you've asked in the past, what kinds of things are you looking for?

P11: While the status is important, right? Have they gotten to it? Has it… Is there a reply there? I love that there's a view details option, so I can see What has happened to my application? Or question, in this case. And I do like the history of my previous questions being there. This is pretty standard stuff, too. I do… Yeah, I kind of expect this,

Researcher: And what information is most important to you here?

P11: It would be the status. And the view details.

Researcher: Okay. Can you talk a little bit more about the importance of the status field?

P11: Well, if I see that There's been no response. Well, in this case, this one is solved, this one has been reopened. It just… it just lets me know that transparency, remember we discussed before? Like. what's going on? Look, another example I have is I have another issue with my college son, is when he turned 18, part of my VA benefits, were decreased because He's considered no longer my beneficiary, but unless he's enrolled in college. And so, we've submitted the paperwork for that, and that has been since June as well, July, June, and… On my particular status, it still says I'm in Step 1. We've received your application since July. So, in this case. the status is important, I know they received it, but no one has reviewed it, but at least I know they received it. I don't know.

Researcher: Yeah.

P11: Yeah.

Researcher: I mean, is there anything else you would want to see here that would be helpful?

P11: it would be helpful to see if something was missing. Like, in this case, view details, you know, if it says. we're missing… ABC… in your application, for example, then I would know to upload it, instead of you know…

Researcher: And… what order are you seeing the questions in here?

P11: It looks like from newest to oldest, and I could filter it. So that's pretty helpful.

Researcher: What order would you want to see these in?

P11: Newest to oldest, just like this.

Researcher: Okay.

P11: And do I… can I click on the categories and change it to the… no, I can't, it looks like. Oh, but I could search it by… Status and category, so that's pretty good, yep.

Researcher: Can you talk me through a little bit more about, what you were trying to do there with category and the filters?

P11: I was just trying to see if I could, you know, like an Excel spreadsheet, just click on it and have it filter into different categories, but it's up top. I see that there's a filter up top, so that was unnecessary.

Researcher: Okay. Okay. Any other thoughts on just viewing your previous questions here?

P11: No? It looks pretty good, actually.

Researcher: Okay. I like the little summary on what my question is, so I could…

P11: kind of, just at a glance, choose the right option in case I've submitted multiple questions. Related to the same topic? And the dates are very helpful as well. Like, when it was last updated.

Researcher: Okay. Now, we're going to ask you to complete the same tasks in a slightly different system. Some things you'll notice are very similar, while others are very different, and we want to understand which experience you prefer. So, I'm going to have you go back to your Zoom chat, and I've put a third link in there for you to click on. Okay, and as that link is loading, I will go ahead and prompt again with a similar scenario. So, imagine you've already logged in to your VA account, and just as we did before, imagine you're having an issue with your work-study benefits. You've been directed to ask VA to get help, so show us how you would get help with your work-study benefits issue through Ask VA. Oh, and I think you're muted. I can no longer hear you, if you…

P11: Okay, sorry about that.

Researcher: No.

P11: Can you hear me?

Researcher: Yes, I can hear you now.

P11: Okay, so I just went in the… Previous screen, I had something, and I continued, and now it looks like I can select a category. Okay, I'll select the education and work study. Continue. Same thing… work study… Continue… We'll do the general question again. I'm a veteran… Continue. This all seems the same so far. Yeah. Okay. Subject…

Researcher: Yeah, so you can't necessarily type in things here. I would love for you to kind of walk me through what you would want to type in here, and how you would go about doing that.

P11: Well… I'm… that's… that's pretty much what I would type, work-study payment.

Researcher: So maybe think about your, like, the scenario you've kind of been describing with your son.

P11: Oh.

Researcher: What would you kind of type in into the subject and into the question?

P11: The subject, I would type in… is, the VA disability benefit. beneficiary payment, something along that line, and then I would ask him the question, like, in this case. My son turned 18. I realize my benefits have changed. I've submitted paperwork to show that he is full-time enrolled in college. I saw that on this date you received my application, but there's been no update since July. Can you please tell me? you know, where are we in reviewing this application? Am I missing anything? Please let me know, and I'll submit additional information if it's… if it's needed, anything like that. And then… I would, I guess.

Researcher: How about forming your question for something like this?

P11: How do I go about forming my question?

Researcher: Yeah.

P11: I tend to be pretty direct. I typically would give a background on what I'm asking. and what I've done already, and then I would pose my question. Like, what's missing? Or, can you please update me on… The review process, you know. But I would… and… I mean, just out of pure redundancy, I would reattach all my information that I submitted the first time, just in case. Because I haven't heard anything!

Researcher: Hmm.

P11: I mean… Yeah.

Researcher: Okay.

P11: It seems like a lot of extra work, but, I mean, after 3 months, you know?

Researcher: Hmm. And you're talking about it would be extra work to upload all of the files that you've already uploaded?

P11: Right.

Researcher: or…

P11: Right. So, if I somehow was able to see that, hey. that they've received it? Like, if I clicked… oh, yeah, so if… if by clicking on the work study, or in my case, the dependent benefits, if I'm able to click on that question and see that They already have my uploaded files there. I wouldn't re-upload it, I'd be like, okay, they have it.

Researcher: No big deal.

P11: But because I can't see, right?

Researcher: Hmm.

P11: I don't know where those… ones and zeros went, if they ever got to them, or if they were able to open the file or not, because sometimes things get corrupt when you upload it.

Researcher: Hmm.

P11: So then there might be a holdup on their end because they can't read what I uploaded. But I have no idea. But if I'm… if I have that same transparency, like, if there's a shared folder in which I can click on it and say, oh, yeah, there it is, they have it.

Researcher: Hmm.

P11: It would minimize… those uncertainties, as well as now I don't… I'm not uploading an extra thing for them to look at, which wastes time on both ends, you know?

Researcher: Yam.

P11: I don't know if that's possible.

Researcher: I appreciate you kind of walking through, kind of, your thought process on that.

P11: What would you like me to do next? Should I continue?

Researcher: Yeah, go ahead and continue.

P11: Looks like I'm re-verifying all my information again, and my file's there, and then I can submit. Is it me, or this was pretty much the same thing, except for that one subject line? Right?

Researcher: Yeah, did you ex… did you… you didn't find anything that was different about that, the way that form went?

P11: Not initially, but I think that subject line was different, right?

Researcher: Okay. Well, I was gonna ask, on a scale from 1 to 5, how easy or difficult was this task for you? So, 1 being very difficult, and 5 being very easy.

P11: Well… because I'd gone through it once already, it was definitely easier this time, because I kind of knew what to expect, but only because I knew what to expect.

Researcher: Okay.

P11: But, I mean, it is pretty standard, I guess, and I did enjoy… I guess I appreciate having that subject line, I don't know.

Researcher: Okay. Can you expand a little bit on that?

P11: It will… it… it fulfilled that other part that I didn't… that was missing from the first one, that it didn't… the first one didn't give me that payment option, remember I said that a lot of the veterans really just care about the payment? Because that's one of the biggest… hurdles, right? Receiving payment is always… I don't know anybody who's… who have… very few people receive things on time from the VA, right? Just anecdotal experience. Payment's always delayed. So, when you initially start a process, once you… start receiving payment, it seems like they come on time, but that initial… approval and first payment is always a delay, so having the option to put in You know, a question about my payment specifically.

Researcher: Hmm.

P11: I don't know if that's helpful or not from the VA's end, but at least it made me feel better. Cause I- that I… that I can, you know. Be specific about what my question is.

Researcher: Okay. One additional rating question on this one is, on a scale from 1 to 5, how satisfied were you with this process?

P11: again, it depends if I get an email confirmation.

Researcher: Okay. I mean, I have this here.

P11: But they'll send me an email confirmation, but… I don't know. Sometimes I don't get the stuff, and… I've gotten into the practice where I screenshot everything with the reference number, just in case, but I don't know that some other people would do that.

Researcher: Okay.

P11: So if I get that email confirmation, I'll be very satisfied. I give it a 5.

Researcher: Okay. Great. We've got one final task that I'm gonna move us to quickly, because I know we only have a few more minutes here, so I'm putting a last link in the chat for you. And, as soon as that starts loading, yeah. A similar task, imagine it's been a month or so since you submitted that question, and you wanted to go back and check on that specific question about your work-study benefits. How would you go about doing that here?

P11: Oh. It's a slightly different interface. I would click on this one here, it looks like it's the newest one, where I just submitted the question again. The others are in progress, solved, reopened. That's pretty nice. Review conversation, let's see what… what we have here. My attachments are there, that's great. There's the question. Okay.

Researcher: Yeah, so going back to that previous page, What attributes of your question are you looking for here?

P11: The status, which is the whole reason I logged on. I… I like the little… Status bars up front, new, in progress, solved, reopened. So that's very helpful. review conversation, I guess it's just, like, view details, same thing. So that's helpful, too. So the main two things I'm looking for are there. This just has bigger banners. So, it's just an aesthetic thing for some people, I guess.

Researcher: Is there anything else that you think would be helpful to see here?

P11: No, it's pretty clear.

Researcher: Okay.

P11: This one might be more helpful for… Some folks… who just prefer bigger banners, you know, like, they're not line by line, but I think it's just a personal preference thing. I prefer this one.

Researcher: Okay. And actually, that… that was kind of our last task, to kind of hear your thoughts on this, and, I do have one set of kind of closeout questions that I wanted to go over with you, and, with that, I'm going to take over the screen share for you to take a look at, Kind of exactly what you're… you're talking about here. So, can you see my screen okay?

P11: Yes.

Researcher: Okay, so you were able to experience two different versions of AskVA today. So this is kind of a representation of your first experience over on the left, and your second experience on the right. So I'm curious, for submitting a question, which of those experiences did you prefer?

P11: Oh, I prefer the second one with the categories.

Researcher: Okay, can you expand a little bit on why?

P11: Cause it's too general just to type out a question initially. and then go through and then select everything. It was better just to, like, say, hey, I'm here for education benefits only. you know, and it… it zoomed in on what the question was, and then it allowed me to ask the question, versus I type in some random stuff, and then I select the category.

Researcher: Hmm.

P11: Which seems a little backwards.

Researcher: Okay. Okay, so you prefer, like you said, the selecting from some of those drop-downs and those lists, before you've typed in a question, is that correct?

P11: Yes, assuming all the drop-downs are inclusive. Now, if there isn't, I would want an other, you know. Because I don't know all the categories, right? But there might be something missing, who knows?

Researcher: Okay. So, similarly, you got to experience two different versions of Of this page, looking at a previous question. So the one on the left is the first one you experienced, and the one on the right is the one you were just looking at. I believe I heard you call out a specific preference, but now looking at them side by side, I wanted to make sure, I heard that correctly. So, which one of these two did you prefer for looking at your previous questions?

P11: Maybe the second one, just because the status is more… a parent. Okay. Because it has that banner there, like, in progress, in progress, you know, versus… I think they're both fine. I wouldn't be upset if I had either of them. They had the information I needed, it's just a matter of aesthetics, right? So…

Researcher: Okay. It sounds like the… the status is kind of the most important piece of information for you here, though, is that correct?

P11: Yes, because that would be the only reason why I'm… I'm on there. I want to know the status.

Researcher: Okay.

P11: So, to have that front and forward just feels more satisfying, because I wouldn't log on otherwise.

Researcher: Okay. Well, that was my last question for you. We just have probably less than a minute, so I wanted to circle back and reconfirm that you would be comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session. I guess it wouldn't be a video clip, it would be kind of an audio and potentially showing your screen share, with our VA partners. And just as a reminder, we remove all identifiable information, and really just sharing this type of information with folks is to help us improve VA.gov and other digital experiences. So…

P11: Yes.

Researcher: Are you still comfortable with doing that?

P11: I am, and I'm actually very grateful you guys are doing this, because I've been seeing… I actually have been seeing the improvements in the last two years. From when I first started using… there's been leaps and bounds of improvements in both the app and the website, so… I do appreciate what you're doing, and that the VA is taking your recommendations and our feedback and making positive changes.

Researcher: Well, I am so happy to hear that, that those improvements are being felt by veterans like yourself. So I'll go ahead and close this out, because I think just to… To add on to that, we're so grateful for you to take some time out of your day to talk to us about your experiences, your thoughts, your feedback, in order for us to continue making these experience is better for you. One last thing I wanted to call out was, Perigian is going to be sending you a thank you note, and they often will add a little blurb that you can send to other veterans. to participate in future research studies like this, so that we can continue to understand people's perspectives on these things, like I said, in order to continue improving them. So feel free to send that to other veterans when you receive it.

P11: Okay, I will. Are you guys having trouble getting participants? Or…

Researcher: Not necessarily, it's just to continue to, like, contain… create, like, a robust set of participants and veterans of all different walks of life. It's really helpful for us to have a diverse representation for this research, so we're continuing to always look for new folks who can participate.

P11: Got it. Alright.

Researcher: Yeah. Well, do you have any questions before we go ahead and sign off?

P11: I don't. Thanks for being timely.

Researcher: Yeah, thank you so much for giving us the time. We really appreciate it.

P11: You're very welcome. You have a great day now.

Researcher: Have a great day. Bye.

P11: Bye-bye.
