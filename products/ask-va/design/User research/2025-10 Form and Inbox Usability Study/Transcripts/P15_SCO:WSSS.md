Researcher: Off here? Yeah, there it is. OK. So now that I have started the reporting, I would like you to once again just confirm that you're OK with us recording today.

P15: I'm perfectly fine with you guys recording.

Researcher: OK, awesome. So that was kind of just my introduction to help set your expectations for the next 40 or 50 minutes together before we dive in then. Do you have any questions for me?

P15: Not yet. Not yet.

Researcher: All right. All right. Awesome. Well, I know you're with Lonestar College, is that right?

P15: And with Santa Fe college.

Researcher: Santa Fe College. I'm sorry. Yes, thank you, Santa Fe college.

P15: Santa Fe College.

Researcher: So kind of with that in mind, that's kind of like the baseline of information I had from you. So I was hoping you could just tell me a little bit more about yourself, maybe your role kind of your years of experience in that role would also love to hear a little bit more I think by your signature it sounded like you were a veteran. You're are a veteran, so I'd love to hear maybe just a little bit about that experience as well.

P15: Sure, I am a veteran. I'm I served in Marine Corps for 25 years. When I retired, I had completed my a A and decided to come to Santa Fe to get my prerequisites to then transfer to the University of Florida and continue my education because I figured I earned that benefit and Dang it if I wasn't going to use it so. That's kind of how I got introduced even to the VA world. Because while I was a student here initially, I was also a board study. So I was exposed already to kind of benefits and stuff like that once I graduated my old boss, the old coordinator at the time, came back to just talk to him. He said he had a temporary position. Here at the college, I explained that that's fine. I take the temporary, but if something came up. You know, I'd be moving on, and of course that was back in 2010 and I'm still here at the college. From that temporary position, I became the specialist like I started doing actual certifications in 2012 and in 2014 I became the coordinator. So first a specialist, then the coordinator and now recently I moved. From coordinator, I'm now the director of veteran programs and also the trio programs here at the college. So I'm pretty new on my new role. I've been doing it for about 3 months now so I'm still very involved with our veteran program, but not so much in the nitty gritty of all the certifications and even with svai haven't done really. I don't think anything since. August, the end of August, I think. What was the last time I did anything?

Researcher: Hmm.

P15: Because we now have a new coordinator in that position, which is Nick.

Researcher: Hmm.

P15: He's the one that took over for my role, but I'm basically that that all of it in a nutshell.

Researcher: Awesome. So I guess.

P15: Oh, sorry. Maybe important things to say is I'm also part of the SCO collaboration team and

Researcher: Hmm.

P15: I'm also just got off the board with NAFTA and I'm also the Vice president of FAVES, our state organization that does the conferences with the, you know, jointly with the VA and RS8.

Researcher: Yeah. No, that's really helpful to just understand a little bit more about your background and kind of how you got to to where you are today. So I'm curious from and and maybe I'll have you speak during our time together with a little bit of your experience. As you know, the specialist, the coordinator and some of those like SEO processes that you've done in the past. One kind of my next question was if you could walk me through overall. Like what your role looked like as either a specialist or coordinator just in that. School certifying official role like. What does that look like for for you and and maybe not for Nick.

P15: Right. So as a specialist, your main focus is certifications, right? So you, you know, obviously I started with VA once, which sometimes I still miss, which I would never have thought I'd say that but. I that was most of my role when I then also took over doing certifications. I also kind of started being in charge of the work studies. So I started dealing with the contracts and we used to like. Fax them in and stuff, you know, to the VA.

Researcher: OK.

P15: You still do some of the you know, with our college. Our job is not just certification, it's also, you know, it was the club. Advisor for you know, student Veterans of America.

Researcher: Hmm.

P15: Back then, we called it Collegiate Veteran society. So I was involved with with that and then just any of the events we normally did at the College for Veterans and just. We at our college, we really have. Always focused on our service as a holistic service since the beginning and I learned that from my previous supervisor right when we not only take care of the certifications, we connect them to the VA, we get a veteran service officer that comes in our office. Heck, they need. A flu shot? The VA comes into our office and does flu shots, so we're really just have a holistic view on how to serve. Veterans. So. So in all our rose weather is the specialist, the coordinator or now me as the director. It's always been the focus of taking care of every aspect of the student veteran and their and the dependents that come in active duty. Obviously National Guard, we don't have as many. Of those, but actually we're starting to get more dependents than we have veterans right now. So go ahead.

Researcher: And and how many veterans do you normally serve in like a semester time frame?

P15: So right now our numbers are actually going up total between veterans and dependents. It's close to about 600 now. We've been when I started, I remember because it was the beginning of post 911. Back then, we had maybe more like 8800 that we served.

Researcher: Hmm.

P15: Numbers obviously went down during COVID and then now they're starting to climb back up again. Yeah.

Researcher: OK. And you talked a little bit about SBA and maybe it's been maybe a couple months since you used it. I would say maybe in those previous roles, how frequently were you using SBA?

P15: Quite often because we tend to like our work studies. So we've always had, I believe in the work study program. And it's a great supporter for what we do. So that's really what I use asba the most for was doing contracts and extensions. Also, if we had like any. Issues with. Better or payments? But typically that was only if. Let's say I didn't really get a good clarification through the hotline. So typically the hotline was my to go to 'cause. I like having a voice that's telling me stuff and then. Sorry. And then if that didn't work out or if we felt that we needed to, to sense supporting documentation in to kind of. Explain our situation then. That's where we tended to use SBA more.

Researcher: OK. And you said frequently, is it like, you know like 10 times a week or 10 * a month or kind of like maybe if you could help me understand just like the scale?

P15: Say. Maybe like? Two to three times a week because every you know the work studies are submitting time cards at different times or you know if we had a situation we couldn't resolve

Researcher: Hmm.

P15: over the call center with the call center or even resolve ourselves with our finance and we would go. Ahead and submit something through through SBA. I will probably say Nick uses it more, uses it more than I do. I like. I'm so old school, so I like talking to a person so. Yeah.

Researcher: OK. OK, great. Well, yeah, that really helps to just again understand kind of what it looks like at y'all's school and kind of some of the processes that you're going through. I'm gonna move us now into the next part of our session. I'm gonna be providing you with some different scenarios and tasks, and I'm gonna first have you start by sharing your screen with us, and then I'll be providing you with a link. In our chat. OK. Yep. So I can see your screen. I'm gonna be providing you with a link in our team's chat, so if you can pull that up in the window that you're sharing, that would be great.

P15: Sure.

Researcher: OK. So as that kind of gets loaded up. Yeah, looks like it's loaded in there at the top. OK. So I want you to imagine that you need to submit documentation on behalf of a student for their education benefits. So you're using ask BA to submit this documentation before you click on anything. Take a second to look around and just talk me through what it is that you're seeing here and this will kind of just be like our warm up so that you can start getting famil. With just that talk up out loud method.

P15: Sure. So first, I'm seeing SVA, which tells me I'm in the right page, right? Not sure on the, you know like probably I would have read first time around would have read that we can pre fill some of your information which I will find helpful and I'd like that to ask a new question is right on the top of everything. So I. Don't have to go digging for anything. So.

Researcher: And I'm curious, kind of in the context of of your work, how do you normally get to ask the?

P15: I normally have it saved on my favorites or I just start putting ask BA and it automatically populates because used to constantly be in there.

Researcher: Hmm.

P15: So that's pretty much I don't typically go through all the I know some people go

Researcher: OK.

P15: through the actual VA website and they go from there. I typically just go straight to the link.

Researcher: Great. So now I want you to go ahead and use this tool to use SVA to submit your documentation on behalf of a student. And kind of talk out loud as your. Yeah. As you're walking through.

P15: Yeah, yeah, I saw that. That would have been me, supposedly. I will come, come in here and start just kind of typing my scenario, whatever it is that is going on with the student.

Researcher: Yeah. So in this instance, you can't necessarily type.

P15: And then.

Researcher: So I would love to. Yeah, just hear kind of maybe even an example. Like, what would you be typing into the question here?

P15: So let's say it's a work study. I would say something like you know. Time record submitted back on blah blah blah for Joe Smith. ACN number so and so. It was submitted on this dates but now 10 work days student still has not been paid. Trying to find out the status on payment. I might do something like that or I might.

Researcher: And what does ACN number mean to you?

P15: ACN number is the contract number for the work. Study that contract that the work study has. So normally I put it there just so it makes it easy for them to track the student right instead of giving the last four of Social Security number, the ACN number will. Always put them straight into the that work study contract. And then you know, I would just pretty much hit continue. I might, depending on what's going on. You know, I could possibly, if I feel like. Maybe this isn't the first time where it's been a while, right? Or I might also upload the timecard onto this so that they can see. You know, here's the time card I'm referring to, right? And then that one's nice too, because they can then see the student's name. Or, you know the student's AC, the contract number and everything. Thing to hopefully expedite everything.

Researcher: OK.

P15: Can I hit continue? Or should I hit?

Researcher: Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, go ahead and continue on as you would.

P15: OK. So I would do education, let's say work study, hit continue and then I would look in here. Usually it's I I already know. Work study, sorry. It lets me click it. OK, it's not letting me click that one so. Does it matter?

Researcher: Yes, I guess in in this case, yeah, you kind of give us an example of work study or can you talk me through a little bit about what this list means to you?

P15: So when I look at this list, which? It's a pretty long list. If it wasn't that I was doing work study, then I might be like oh OK. Which one of these situation best fits what I need right now? It looks like at least it's in alphabetical order, so that's good. I guess you know gives it some kind of order. But again, if you didn't know the exact wording, alphabetical doesn't mean anything, right? It will if I'm constantly going in there, then I know work study B&amp; W is at the end because you guys, once I do this a little while, I realize that it's alphabetically. I'm gonna go to the bottom. But otherwise I feel like it's kind of. I would like to see it more where like items together, right? Or anything on let's say. It says post 9/11, 1607 like I would like all that all the different chapters maybe together so it makes it easier to find that. You know, so just putting like items together I think would be really helpful and not as frustrating, especially for a new SEO trying to figure out which one of these things, you know it is or you know, let's say they have a veteran that's doing work study but. They're on post 911. That the new SEO knows that, OK. Yeah. Then on 11. But that's not what this question is about. Specifically about work study, so they might overlook that work study's always at the bottom right. So I don't know, maybe. Even categorizing them like instead of one whole long list, right?

Researcher: Hmm.

P15: Just making it really easy to spot.

Researcher: OK. And what would you do if you couldn't find an option that worked for you?

P15: If I didn't find an option, that was, let's say let's say works that he was, I would try to go with what was the closest. So in my case it let's say it was work study. I would then if I didn't find anything, probably really go into post 9/11 if the veteran was post 911. You know because there is no other in here that I could see. Right. So.

Researcher: And what would you expect from there? Is one option here that I'm curious about your thoughts on? There is an option that says school certifying officials. What would you expect to find there?

P15: You know honestly. I would think that maybe that would be more maybe me having some issues, whether it's with the system, EM, you know, something having to do with my specific job, not so much with the student.

Researcher: Hmm. OK. Yeah, that's really helpful to to understand. I I think to to move us into the next section. I am going to have you click on the school certifying official. Option but just noting I guess in my head that you would have selected work study there. OK, great.

P15: OK.

Researcher: Yeah, you can go ahead and continue, yeah.

P15: So yeah, OK. I do like you can see it easily. You know that the file name on there it's pretty pretty obvious. So I do like that part. You know, 'cause sometimes you upload and you're like, OK. Did it go up? You know, and I I like that. Yeah, this is. The one thing I didn't like about SVA is that it kind of the issue when you are the veteran, you know, separating your duties as SCO from your

Researcher: Hmm.

P15: duties as the veteran, right, so. I'm almost feeling like, honestly. If it's Seo's at most it, I guess it depends, right? For me, because I am mostly going to SBA as a school certified official and not as a veteran per southeast. I think that initially, when I I might even just because in the habit of being a veteran marking veteran, might have overlooked the question.

Researcher: You.

P15: What's my relationship to the veteran I'm writing about? Not necessarily.

Researcher: Hmm.

P15: Me the veteran, right. So. Which is, you know, it's a good question, but it just could throw, I think people off or people not read and just read the three things unfortunately, right. So I see it. Where for me as a school certified fish, I wouldn't like it to be the number one, right? And then go OK, that is my role right now. I don't know how that could be improved to. But yeah, just looking at it quickly. That's that's only thing I would say about that.

Researcher: OK.

P15: So I think sometimes this one can be a little bit. Challenging because you can be a school certified official in a worksite supervisor.

Researcher: Hmm.

P15: And I know that it's worked out where like if I I say school certified official even like on the hotline and then I have a work study question they'll say wait you got to go with the work study right so.

Researcher: Hmm.

P15: This. This could bring an issue. OK, I guess you know the person has to stop and say, OK, what is my role with this situation, right. Not necessarily my overall role. What's my role now with this question that I'm asking right?

Researcher: Hmm.

P15: So I'm doing work study contracts. My role right now is I'm a work site supervisor because I'm doing contract. But if I'm doing certifications and I have a questions questions about that, then I'm a school certified official. Right. So that that's the only thing I also kind of have gotten frustrated, especially with the hotline number is OK. I got a work study question, but that might be more involved with it. But I'm a school certified official, right? So.

Researcher: OK. So I guess for for you, I know you're doing stuff with work study. Are you in particular? Are you also considered a work study site supervisor like you do? Fall into both of those roles, currently or in the past in the past.

P15: I did. I did. I did. Actually I still do because I'm still the primary at the moment. The work site. Super. I'm the primary work site supervisor, but I'm still, even though I'm a director, I still am a school certified official because I'm kind of like the backup now that if we get super.

Researcher: Gotcha.

P15: Busy. I can still help them out with certification, right?

Researcher: OK.

P15: And then Nick is. Nick is in the same role because now he's even being the alternate work study work site supervisor. But he's also.

Researcher: Yes.

P15: School certified official. Which a lot of us are both.

Researcher: OK.

P15: You know, there's some cases where we're just work site supervisor, but most of those are off campus. They're the VA hospital, the vet centers. Those are typically the ones that are just your work site supervised.

Researcher: Gotcha. OK. That's that's really helpful clarification. Thank you.

P15: On my that one. OK. Just pick one.

Researcher: Yeah.

P15: Does it matter? OK, confirm I did. I do like that that it then comes up here and shows that, OK. It's nice, you know, 'cause sometimes you scrolling so fast and it's nice to that.

Researcher: Hmm.

P15: It's like a little confirmation. State. No, no. You guys want me to pick? No. OK. I think it's good. I do like this too, that even after you put write whatever your stuff, you can still go back and edit. So that is a nice option. Just case you forgot something. I like that you can see you know what the question is. Typically I've learned from a long time ago and I still do it and I don't know if it's, but I always put my subject line to be work study if I'm doing work, study, work, study and then I put whatever. Case of whoever right 'cause, I know that in the past and I would say Kevin's even one that has mentioned that that helps them route know exactly who it's going to, right. So and I like that I can see the attachment is has uploaded. OK. Yeah, I I definitely do like SVA that you can verify everything before you submit to ensure that you did everything correctly. And I do like that you can edit it just that section instead of having to go back and redo everything all over again.

Researcher: OK. So on a scale from 1:00 to 5:00, how easy. Or difficult. Was it to complete this task one? Being very difficult and five being very easy.

P15: I would. I would probably say A4 easy, easy and then again I'm used to it now. So as a new one I would probably say it's still pretty simple the form.

Researcher: Yeah. And on the scale from 1:00 to 5:00, how satisfied were you with this process? One being very unsatisfied and five being very satisfied?

P15: Five, it's it's not the submitting that. It's the satisfaction. It's getting a response. It's it's the challenge sometimes.

Researcher: OK. And how did you feel overall about the length of the form that you completed?

P15: Not bad. Not bad. It's shorter than it used to be.

Researcher: And what did you think about just like the order of things in the form?

P15: I think the order was fine and then see where. Yeah, I don't see where anything needed to be shifted, at least that I can recall. I mean, I think the order went through fine.

Researcher: And what would you do next after submitting?

P15: I will probably go in my e-mail, verify that that I got the confirmation that they did receive it, that it did go all through on the system.

Researcher: And what would you expect us VA to do next?

P15: Well, I would expect them to process it in a timely manner. I would expect it to be done in order receipt. I would expect to be kind of updated on it if there's an issue or if it's gonna take longer than usual. It would be nice to get something that says we're still working on it. I think the biggest issues that I've had with SBA and I and again I haven't been in in the last three months really is. Two things. One is. The fact that they close out the ticket, you know, they give you a response, they close out the ticket and not having enough. Time to respond back to the ticket instead of having to start a new ticket all over again. Again, because sometimes it could be a matter of misunderstanding. Or let's say it's a quick correction that we can do instead of putting especially again with work study, putting them in the back of the line again, right? Because that's what will happen if I have to start a ticket now.

Researcher: Hmm.

P15: It just took 10 days. Now I'm putting the student back on the back burner, you know, on the back of the line, again for it to for the VA to get to it again. And now you're talking about it becomes a financial hardship. For the student. So that would be the other thing. And then not being able to view my history is is a big thing for me too. And the reason? Part of the reason? For that is. Obviously, if there's any issues, I can go back and see what was submitted. But my work studies a lot of times and probably most of us use us as references. And the VA or and a lot of them go work for the VA or federal jobs,

Researcher: Hmm. I see.

P15: they'll call us to want to know dates, and I can't. I can't go back into history and say this person, you know, started On this date and ended On this date, you know. Oh, you know 'cause, I'm going to look at that last time card, right? And and again, because we're not obligated to keep any of the records past a certain time so that that's. The other thing I mean, I don't know what would be. Be reasonable, but it definitely isn't what it is. Now with just three pages 'cause, it's not even. I can't even go back into the contracts of people that are still doing work study with us.

Researcher: Yeah, I was gonna say. How long would you want the history for?

P15: You know. I. I. I mean, even to be fair, just. You know, pass them. Maybe the one year when once they graduate, you know, or one year passed the last contract, you know, something like that, you know, not nothing crazy. 'cause I understand it takes a lot of space, right? But I mean right now I I think I can only see 4. And what was funny when I went into my SVAI saw my last thing on August of 2025. But then it was showing things from 2021, so I have no idea what's going on there.

Researcher: OK. Well, that is actually a very good segue into our second task. So I am going to send you a second link in our teams chat that I'll have you open up here in your browser again. And at this point I want you to imagine kind of some of the scenarios you were just talking through. Maybe you had someone. Ask for some specific dates from a student for you to look into. So imagine something like that has even prompted with and you need to review a previous submission. So show us how you would go about doing that here.

P15: I probably would try to search possibly by name or. The the category right to try to narrow it down. Depending how far back it was, right. If it's that I know was done within the last week, I probably would just grow and look, you know for the because I always put my work studies names. On here as a subject line that last name so so I can easily find it.

Researcher: Hmm.

P15: So I would probably scroll really quick through it and then just try to find them that way. I probably honestly would. Only two pages worth. Especially now, I think we get 3 pages. I would probably scroll and come up and try to even find them on category.

Researcher: Hmm. OK. So you talked about, I was gonna ask a question about, like, what attributes you're using to look for the questions I heard kind of name or something that might be in your subject.

P15: Mm-hmm.

Researcher: Or possibly category? Is that right? Is there any other attributes that you're kind of looking at for a previous submission?

P15: Probably not. I'd probably be looking primarily for the name or or what it was contract extension.

Researcher: OK.

P15: You know key keywords on the subject line.

Researcher: OK. And when you look at things here, is there any other information that you think is maybe missing that would be helpful for you to see here?

P15: Well, I mean possibility could be that you guys do provide like? A ticket number you know, so could be where they can look for it under ticket number since they already have that. Or again if the like the work study, they have a contract number. Would be nice. I know that obviously we don't wanna do socials and even last fours could be forever. You know that's not gonna work. So I think I would look. Those would be the other things that I might wanna, especially if I can find 'cause. I know if I pulled that contract number, at least I know that's that student only and I'll bring all the history on that student for me.

Researcher: OK. And what order are you seeing things here?

P15: I'm seeing them by date, the newest. On the wrong. Yeah, on the top. All this on bottom.

Researcher: In what order would you want to see these in? When you're looking at your previous submissions?

P15: No, I think. I think I like it just like this with the oldest on the top. And I mean, you know, the newest on the top and the oldest on the bottom.

Researcher: And as you are a veteran yourself too, what differences might you expect when reviewing questions as a veteran as opposed to an SEO or a work study site supervisor?

P15: What kind of questions would I see?

Researcher: What difference would you expect to see in like looking for a previous question?

P15: You know, honestly, I don't think I've ever used SBA for personal. If I had to, I'd probably something very similar. You know data submitted it. The subject, I don't know the question. You know, hopefully I would remember what I asked and put on the subject line. And still in the same order. I can't think of anything that I feel would help in any different type of order. I think the other thing that and now that you mentioned that and I see the business and the personal tab. I think I know when. I was initially in SBA, the in the beginning. I. I don't know if it would automatically went into your personal you had to press business, you know, to go and do the work study.

Researcher: Hmm.

P15: So I have some of my work study records on my personal because I didn't know there was two separate tab and that it also have personal at the time so. Yeah, I like that it. I would like it to. Almost. I don't know. It's kind of hard because I know we also have veterans that go in here to do this. For me, I would like it to default to business.

Researcher: Hmm.

P15: Since that's what I'm usually in here, or have a choice to do that. So I'm not putting student stuff on my personal record and vice versa.

Researcher: OK, OK.

P15: Oh, even a different color, something so we can notice that. Hey, there's two tabs up there.

Researcher: OK. Yeah, that's that's really helpful to hear your thoughts on that. At this point, we're going to actually be completing some of these same tasks in a slightly different system. Some things will look very similar while others may be completely different. We want to understand overall which one you end up preferring, so I'm gonna put another link in our chat here. So I'll have you again. Click on that link and. Open that up in your browser. So as that's opening again, I want you to imagine that you've come to ask BA to submit some documentation on behalf of a student for their education benefits. Show us again how you would use ask BA to submit your documentation. And talk through what you're seeing and and how you're feeling about it.

P15: Sure. So it looks like the category. And I would probably. Put it in here. And then again I would Scroll down to see which. But it pertains to. I guess you know now knowing this I would have probably put school certified official if it wasn't having to do with work study. But I would probably, since that's what I'm gonna go ahead and put that. I have a question on the vet. See again here. Even though I'm doing, let's say if I was doing work study, I will not know which one should I pick. Right. Should I? But because right now I'm just doing, let's say a status on some enrollment. I will probably have gone there.

Researcher: So again, you can't necessarily type in here,

P15: Ignore.

Researcher: but I would love to understand kind of what you would want to type into the fields you see here.

P15: Let's say I had an issue with a certification. Maybe it was done incorrectly and we're trying to fix it, but the payment is, you know, students still getting a debt. I might say, you know, original certification submitted on such and such day with enrollment ID number, blah blah blah for student so and so. Then I probably would say something like. You know, certification was submitted an error. Correct certification was then submitted on such and such day enrollment ID, so and so. Please ensure record gets updated. Student is being charged a debt that they shouldn't be being charged, something like that.

Researcher: And you've talked about this a little bit already, but I was curious in seeing it here how you would use the subject versus the question differently.

P15: So subject let's if it was work study, I would say work study contract extension for. Cranford if it was 0 hour I would say 0 hour extension for Cranford. If it was, something would do with payment that's say in this case I might put down. Error you know certification error. A case of Smith and then and then I will write the situation down. So just kind of to keep it the same and so it also makes it easy for me to find.

Researcher: OK. And what might you want to attach here?

P15: So again, if it's a work study issue, I might submitting the contract or timecard. If it's a payment, I might submit a copy of the TWENTYTWO 1999 up here so they can see the enrollment ID and that we actually did do it. And what the error was might even go as far as having a little drawing and pointing to the enrollment ID. In the date you know to make it very clear for them what the issue is and even the recommendation for correction.

Researcher: OK. OK. So feel free to continue on as you would.

P15: Just again, make sure everything was correct. Make edits if I needed to, and then I would just submit it that way.

Researcher: From 1:00 to 5:00. How easy or difficult was it for you to complete this task? One being very difficult and five being very easy?

P15: It was very easy, but again because I'm used to doing it so might take a new person, you know a little bit, but I think once they realize the format then it becomes pretty simple.

Researcher: So if you had to rate it on from A1 to A5.

P15: Oh, Radio 5.

Researcher: OK. And honestly from 1:00 to 5:00, how satisfied were you with the process? Again, one being very unsatisfied and five being very satisfied.

P15: Yeah, I mean, I was so say A5. Like I said, the only. Four to five only because of the whole what am I? Am I work site supervisor or am I school certified official right now?

Researcher: Hmm.

P15: Right. So that that to me is the only part that I find is confusing. When we get to that part.

Researcher: And overall, how did you feel about the length and the order of this form?

P15: Lengthen order was good. I didn't find it was too long. Yeah, I think they had enough space to put whatever the situation unlike that, it has a way to add an attachment that is to make your explanation a little bit easier for them on the other end. You know which, of course. And you think if I make it easier for them and make it really simple, self-explanatory, then that means that they're going to respond in the same manner quickly and get what I need done. Basically.

Researcher: So we've got one more task that we're going to go through. And so again, I'm going to put. Our last link in the chat for you to open up. And again, let's imagine that maybe you had someone come back as a reference to. Maybe get some dates for time cards from a student, so you need to review a previous submission. So using this tool show us how you would. Check on a previous submission and ask EA.

P15: If it's been a while. I would probably come to try to see what categories they have. And see if I can, if any of those are gonna help me narrow it down.

Researcher: And what would you expect to see in that category field?

P15: All right. Maybe something like? Time frames, right? It could be something like the subject, whether it's a work study or it's a depth management issue or.

Researcher: Hmm.

P15: And then I'll have what else will help me find it, you know. Yeah, because the the problem that I see is OK, it has a category, but it would be nice if it was a category and then even that category got broken down more or let's say you say. Work, study and then there's a way to put whether it's a contract number or you can put the. Ticket number or something that can help you not ever with all the name the last name of the student, right? Or the person any of any of the above to help you try to find that person.

Researcher: OK.

P15: Mab, it's something recent.

Researcher: On.

P15: I'm probably gonna just scroll. Oh, OK. Yeah, here. Here they are. You know 'cause, I know. I just did it two days ago. So then I know it's gonna be one of the ones that are up front, and I'm gonna probably look for it that way.

Researcher: So what information of what you see here is like the most important to you when you're looking for a previous submission.

P15: The what is here? Oh for me, the. The subject line because that points to me to the student, the student that I'm looking for, the name you know, on the of the student. Secondly, hopefully see in a case where it's somebody that's asking for reference. I'm not gonna know what their reference number for that ticket was, so that's not gonna help me for them now. Now it's gonna help me for the ones that are currently still working for me because I can look at their emails, but still that becomes a pain because. Sometimes that's harder to get right or kind of go through your own record to find. So definitely work. Study. Their contract numbers would be great. Last name would be great, at least an hour down because you know if it comes up with all The Smiths, but only your Smiths. Then you know that's that's OK. 'cause, you can narrow it from that point on. If it has to do with work study, you know. Yes, that would help. Also narrow it down. But I probably trying to find subject line names. Names is the biggest one that I would probably, especially if it's not work study, because if it's just a certification then I would be look trying to find the students at least last name 10 hour with that.

Researcher: OK. And what order would you like to see these in?

P15: Honestly, I really dislike this little box thing. I think I like better when. It used to be more of just lines across, you know. Just because you can only fit so many in here. The thing that is nice about these is that you can click and go right to the conversations for that. So I do like that part but. Uh.

Researcher: And how many would you want to see here?

P15: Umm. Honestly, what could whatever could fit on here that I don't know? Maybe this could be a little smaller where you can fit a few more, but not make it so small that you Dang need magnifying glass to see it on here either. Because I it is nice that you have the date right. Date last updated. I like that you can click right on to review conversations, so that's nice and and you have some of the subject line on here. So that helps us find the students name. But maybe. Just having a few more. So you don't have to scroll through so many. Tabs. But still pretty legible. Yeah, I don't know how else to put it on. Like I see a lot of blank white white on

Researcher: OK. Thank you.

P15: the right and I'm thinking, OK, there could be some more over there.

Researcher: OK, OK. Well, I know we're at time. Do you have just a couple more minutes? I just have a couple close out questions that I wanted to finish us up with.

P15: Sure.

Researcher: OK. Great. Thank you for spending a little bit more time with us. So actually at this point, so that was our last task and I am going to take over sharing screen. Baby. OK. OK. Can you see my screen OK?

P15: Yes.

Researcher: OK, great. So. You were able to see two different versions of ask VA today and the first one was kind of a representation on here on the left. That was the first experience you had to submit documentation and the one on the right is the second one that you experienced so. When you went through the form to submit a question and documentation, I'm curious which one overall you preferred.

P15: I think I like the right one.

Researcher: OK. Can you expand a little bit on kind of why you chose the right?

P15: I think I like. I kind of like that. It kind of starts in a more maybe logical order starting with the category of what it is that you're requesting. Instead of just going straight to the question. Maybe I'm just used to most forms of that way, so I'm a creature of habit.

Researcher: OK. Yeah. And maybe can you talk a little bit more about like the benefit I guess of having the category first for you before jumping into the question?

P15: I think that that, oh, I internally, I feel like OK that will help them see what what section of the VA is gonna handle this. If I say it's works that if I say it's department if I say it's certification which means that it's gonna expedite the process. Is how I'm seeing it. I don't know if that's what happens.

Researcher: OK.

P15: I'm just saying that's how I see that.

Researcher: Yeah. OK. So similarly you got to experience two different versions of reviewing a previous submission and so these are kind of representations of that experience. So on the left you have the first experience you went through and on the right you have the experience. We were just looking at which of these two do you prefer?

P15: I like the one on the left.

Researcher: On the left. So this table view. Can you expand a little bit more on that?

P15: Yeah. Yes, I think the, I.

Researcher: You did mention it before, but.

P15: Yeah, I think just 'cause. It has more on there, which means that I'm not scrolling as much. I can still see the basic information. I can still view the details on it, the date I last submitted it, right? What the status is on it still? I like that it has the subject line basically on there, so I I. I just find it's more clean, less. Less I find, believe it or not, it has more. Almost more information in a sense, but I think the way it's laid out is just easier to find stuff than it is trying to look at every individual box.

Researcher: OK. Great. I'm gonna go ahead and stop sharing. Just to try and close this out now in, in a timely manner. I just wanna say thank you so much for all of your input here. This was super helpful to see how you walk through it and learn about what your process looks like and and what it looks like for your office and your organization. I guess overall just thinking about all the things we looked at, is there anything else in particular that? You really liked about the ask VA experiences, or that you really didn't. Like about the ask Virginia experiences.

P15: Yeah, no, I think. I think I addressed pretty much most of it. I do like the newer version of the lines I like. Again, if it would be different on one for us school certified officials that are worksite supervisors to be distinguished. But I mean, it's pretty still clean, pretty clean, easy on the eyes the only. Like I said, the only part that I find sometimes bothers me. Is these little squares? I don't like those. With the submissions and I just, that's just me. Maybe I just find that it's just not as cream cut and very busy when I look at it that way then and when I'm seeing it across easier for me to scroll, but. I mean, it definitely is better than faxing stuff over to Virginia. And sometimes it's very necessary when you can't. Get an answer from the call center. Or, to be blunt, when you get more than one answer from different people at the call center, sometimes this is our to go, OK. This person said this. This person said that I'm a try third times a charm and I'm a put it on SBA and hope. Let's see. Who do they agree with? Or are they gonna come up with a whole different answer themselves?

Researcher: Oh wow.

P15: So sometimes that's what we also use it for.

Researcher: OK. Wow, that's really that's really interesting to hear. So that was all the questions I had, Sandra. Thank you so much again for spending some time with us on a Friday right before the holidays as well. Just appreciate all of your input here today. So any other questions that you have for me before we close out?

P15: So when do you guys think you'll be done with your evaluation of all this? And we would see either the same or a new version of SBA.

Researcher: Yeah, that's a great question. You know, we're research. The research. We're wrapping up in the next couple of weeks and so I can't necessarily give an exact date of when these changes. We still have to kind of take all of the research into account and evaluate what are the best solutions going forward. So I unfortunately cannot give you an exact date of when that might happen,

P15: Get back.

Researcher: but we are definitely like this research is indicative of our. Desire to improve some of these things that you saw. Today, and so your feedback was valuable in in US understanding how we can make sure to like keep the things that are good and improve the things that that can be improved upon. So yeah, I can't give you an exact date, but in the future I think you'll see some

P15: No, no, I did. That's too good.

Researcher: some good improvements.

P15: I well, the one thing I will say is being in this for a long time is we do appreciate when you guys do take the time and the resources. To. Ask us the ones that are working on it every day for our input. I think that's super valuable and we feel like we're heard, you know, and that will help us do our job better, which will then in turn help you guys in the in the long run. So we appreciate that.

Researcher: Yeah, absolutely. Well, I'm really glad that we were able to speak with you today and and continue to support and improve things for you and and for the folks in your organization, so.

P15: Thank you. Nice meeting you all.

Researcher: Thank you. Have a. Yeah. Nice to meet you. Have a great weekend and a good holiday week.

P15: You. You as well. Bye bye.

Researcher: Bye.
