Researcher: Okay, and now that I've started the recording, I will ask you one more time, are you comfortable with us recording the session today?

P7: Yes, I am.

Researcher: Awesome. All right. Well, thank you so much. Thank you for, just engaging with all of those expectations. It's kind of a lot. So before we dive into some questions, I just wanted to open it up to you first and see if you had any questions for me before we started.

P7: No, I do not.

Researcher: Okay. Alright, so in the initial survey, you indicated that you use VA's education or training benefits. Can you tell me a little bit more about how you're using those benefits?

P7: Yeah, I'm currently using the, the R&E program. While, working on my master's degree.

Researcher: Okay. And have you experienced any challenges related to receiving these education benefits?

P7: No, I have not. It's been, I really haven't had any issues, on the VA side. Earlier on, I didn't realize my… GI Bill had an expiration date. So I lost, I lost some of my GI Bill, because I was, unaware that the GI Bill had an expiration date, so… but that was, that was on me, that wasn't on the VA, per se, so…

Researcher: Okay. Now, maybe thinking more broadly, have you contacted VA for any kind of support in, say, maybe the last, like, 6 months?

P7: No, I have not. I mean, my VR&E counselor reaches out to me just with updates on, you know, how… obviously not recently with the shutdown, but… But she is… she reaches out periodically just with updates with, how my semester is going and if there's anything I need or whatnot.

Researcher: Okay. And how does your VR&E counselor reach out to you? How do you, stay in contact with them?

P7: Oh, yeah. Text and email.

Researcher: Hmm. Okay. Now, I'm curious if you've ever used a tool called AskVA.

P7: I have, It's been a… it's been a while, but I have used it, yes.

Researcher: Okay. So I was gonna ask maybe how frequently you've used it, maybe when was the last time you think you've used it?

P7: It's probably been… A year or two.

Researcher: Okay. And what were you using AskVA for at that point, if you can think back that long?

P7: Oh.

Researcher: And if not, that's no problem. Yeah, that's totally fine. Okay. Well, thank you for just providing me some more context around, kind of, your experience so far, or, like, recently with education benefits and with VA support. I'm gonna move us into our next part of the session. Okay. I'm gonna provide you with some, kind of, scenarios and tasks, and I'm gonna have you start off by sharing your screen with me. Okay.

P7: One second, I'm gonna close the door to my office.

Researcher: No problem.

P7: My wife just got home, so I don't wanna… Any background disruption. Alright, I'm good.

Researcher: No problem. Okay, so you should be able to, in the Zoom window, share your screen. There's, like, a green box at the bottom of the Zoom window with an arrow in it to share, and then I'm gonna be sending you a link in the Zoom chat, so once you've been able to share your screen, I'll have you open up that link.

P7: Now, what options? Just content only, or .

Researcher: Yeah, maybe you could either… it depends, kind of, what you're comfortable sharing. If there's, like, a window that you wanted to share, we could see the whole thing, or if there's maybe a browser that you want to open up, that's what we'll be doing everything in, is in some kind of browser. Okay. So, yeah, if you wanted to open up the link there, yeah. Okay, so as that kind of loads, I want you to imagine that you're having issues with something like your work-study benefits, and you've been directed to AskVA to get help with your issue. Before you click on anything to complete this task, take a second to look around and talk out loud about what it is you're seeing.

P7: I mean, I'm pretty familiar with the… this VA.gov site, I use it frequently just to check on Like, my healthy vet and all that, so… I'm kind of pretty familiar with the overall, gist of it.

Researcher: Okay. Anything else you're seeing here that, You can kind of talk me through what you're thinking about.

P7: I, I didn't realize that now ASVA is now attached to this. I thought it was, like, its own completely separate site, so it's kind of nice that it is, like, kind of integrated into into this, so it's… it'll definitely be easier to access, because I do remember last time I used AskVA, A long time ago, that it was kind of a… Kind of a little bit of a hassle to get to.

Researcher: Hmm. Okay. Yeah, what else are you noticing here as you've landed on this page? And feel free to kind of interact with it as you might want to, or just at least to kind of look around.

P7: Yeah, so, I mean, obviously, It… it's… I'm gathering that I'm not currently signed in, so if I were to sign in, that it would, You know, pre-fill, like, my… My name, maybe my address, email, maybe the last four of my socials, so it's like, it seems like it's… like I'm not, like, currently logged into, VA.gov.

Researcher: Okay. So, at this point, what are your expectations from AskVA?

P7: My… I would, if I knew I was coming here to ask a specific question, I would… assume, like, I would, you know, I'm coming here to ask, like, an education-related question, so I would assume that, you know, once I click on Ask a New Question, you know, there would be the various different subjects, And I would think that education would be one of them, so then I would click Education, and then be able to, like, you know, maybe select, like, a sub-subject, or then be able to, like, put in my cushion underneath the, like, education subject.

Researcher: Okay. And how long would you expect it to get the help you need through ASCBA?

P7: I mean, it says within 7 business days, Obviously, with what's going on currently. I wouldn't expect it to be within 7 days, So, if it was, like, regular business hours, then I would say Within 7 business days.

Researcher: Okay. Now, show me how you would use AskVA to get the help you need for a work-study issue.

P7: I would… first, I would log in, so I know, like, the sign-in is usually, like, above my VA or my healthy vet, like, where a user is, then I would sign in, go through that process. And then when I was… once I was signed in, I would come back to this page and then click on, ask a new question.

Researcher: Yeah, and go ahead and kind of walk through what you would actually do. So, you should be able to, kind of interact with parts of this. So go ahead and try As you were talking through it, and.

P7: Yeah, so I would, you know, once I signed in, I would go ahead and click this. And… you know, what I am signed in, so here's my name, they'll ask for my social, my date of birth. I would, you know, verify and confirm this is all correct. And then continue on from there. Then… I would, I know before, you would kind of select a subject before asking the question. I don't know if that's… It doesn't look like that's the case now. So then I would type in, you know, my question here. In my head, I'm thinking the subject would come next. So I have my, my question typed in here, and then I would go ahead and click continue, and then there is the category.

Researcher: Might pause you there for just a quick second. I'm curious, you mentioned, like, subject and question. I'm curious, like, what the difference is for those things for you.

P7: Yeah, like, just, you know, like, the subject obviously would be, like, the broad thing, like… to just making sure, like, the subject went to, like, the right department. So it's like a education benefits and work study. If I ask… you know, that question, and like, I selected healthcare, it might take a lot longer to get rerouted to the right department. So, that's kind of what I mean by subject. The question is just, like, the, like, the specific Question under that subject. That I'm asking.

Researcher: Okay. Yeah, thanks for, expanding on that for me.

P7: Yeah, so then, you know, this is education, benefits, and Work Study. I would go ahead and select that. And then I would, you know, kind of continue on. And then here, I would… This… Would be, kind of be, like, the topic. In my head, would be, like, the sub… sub-subject, or, like, the… the kind of the… subject under the main category. I was looking for, And what was the topic that we were kind of going with?

Researcher: You've got an issue with your work study.

P7: So then I would specifically work… look for work study in here, and then I would go ahead and select it. And then I would, continue on.

Researcher: And if we do just go back really quick, I wanted to ask maybe a couple of questions about this here. How do you… what is this list that you're seeing here? What does this mean to you, like, in the context of maybe something you would come here for?

P7: I mean, it's, it looks like a list, you know… pretty much everything under, like, the, you know, the, education benefits and work study category. Like, if I was, you know, couldn't get ahold of my, like, my VR&E counselor, then maybe I would come under here and look for, Chapter 31, VR&E. So… but say, like, if my, you know, my son was going to school, then I would look for, like. dependent benefits, or something like that. So, it just looks like it's kind of everything related to education benefits and work study.

Researcher: And how important do you think maybe this list is, and even the previous one that you looked at, for the category that you selected?

P7: I think it's definitely very useful, and important. Say, like, I… It might even open up my eyes to something, like, I didn't know… was… maybe saying, like, related to… or an unknown, like, education or work-study benefit. or something else, like, I may be entitled to.

Researcher: Okay. And you mentioned, a couple different instances that you might use this for, potentially, like, dependent benefits, or something like that. What would you do if you couldn't find an option that fit those needs?

P7: I may either go back. to, like, the previous, and maybe look under, like, a different category, or I might select… like, a rant… like, what I… what in this list, what I think is the closest, and see if it's under, like… You know, the sub-subject.

Researcher: Hmm.

P7: Or kind of work my way through these topics to see what would be… I guess considered the closest.

Researcher: Okay. Great, thanks for kind of expanding on some of those concepts for me. You can go ahead and just continue.

P7: Okay.

Researcher: Through the process.

P7: Here… I'm… this, I would… it's, I guess, kind of a little confusing, because I'm not… really, I guess, knowledgeable under, like, the work-study topic, per se, so… I would probably go ahead and select general question. just because I'm not really, Aware of what these subtopics are. So I would go ahead and select that, and then, continue. Here, if I have, like, like, a PDF of… whatever that I was attaching to, or a picture, or whatever, I would go ahead and, you know, attach it to this part under your attachments. So I… Do I have an attachment?

Researcher: I'm curious, you mentioned, like, maybe different types of attachments. I'm curious if you could maybe describe a time where you would want to attach something? Like, what would be, like, the context around wanting to attach something?

P7: Yeah, say, like, if my VR&E counselor… Asked for, like, a copy of my, transcripts for this semester, I would go ahead to my college and, download an unofficial transcript, save it to my computer, and then, I would upload it here if, like, if she was asking for, like, a copy of my transcripts.

Researcher: Okay, and yeah, I guess, you know, when you talked earlier about just how you're, interacting with your VR&E counselor, you talked about through, like, text and email, Is this a place that you would be directed to, like, provide that information versus an email?

P7: We haven't used this, you know, they have their… Kind of like their own secure messaging, you know, email thing that they use. So I've never, I haven't done it through this, but if… if they move to this, then, yeah, obviously I would use it, but, like, they have their own, like, secure… The way of doing things.

Researcher: Okay. Yeah, that's helpful context. So yeah, you can go ahead and kind of walk through however you might do that for this type of question.

P7: Yeah, so I, I don't have anything to, you know, attach, so, if I did, I would, you know, go ahead and select the folder on my computer and all that, and then add it here. But since I don't, I'll just go ahead and select continue. And it brings me back to the… Yeah.

Researcher: Let's go ahead, I'll kind of walk you through, I'll have you go ahead and continue here. It looks like there was, maybe just a little issue. I'll have you just click into the box of the attachments. Okay. And then, yeah, that should, yeah, that should just kind of imitate the idea of adding an attachment, and you should be able to progress now.

P7: Okay, so I added my attachment. It looks like it's, you know, uploaded, and it's on here, so, you know, once that happens, I'll go ahead and select continue. what is your relationship to the veteran? Obviously, I am the veteran, so I would go ahead and select that. And then I would go ahead and select continue. school state or residency state, I'm… I'm in Ohio, so if… if this was pertaining to something like my VR&E or whatever else, I would go ahead and select Ohio. because my school state is also in Ohio, and then I would, I would select Ohio under, residency state.

Researcher: Okay.

P7: And then I would go ahead and select continue. And then here, since I was logged in. I would think that this is, you know, my phone number, my email address is auto-populated, and it is, so then I would go ahead and continue on. And then it looks like this is all, like, the answers I previously went through. My question, my attachment. the category, the topic, the subtopic, me, the veteran, you know, my school, school state, and then my contact information. Once I verified that, I would go ahead and then, submit the question.

Researcher: Okay. So, on a scale from 1 to 5, how easy or difficult was it to complete that task? And 1 being very difficult, and 5 being very easy?

P7: I would say probably, 5. Just because it's… I mean, it's pretty self-explanatory, and it basically walks you through it. and I knew what I was coming here for. I could see where maybe if I had a question that I wasn't exactly sure where the topic would be, I could see, like. Maybe having difficulty selecting what, you know, what topic or what subtopic. But because I knew I was coming here for, you know, a work-study question, it was, you know, it was… it was easily listed, like, work-study. So, I could see in an instance where, if it wasn't sure, it might be a little more difficult, but in this case, it was very easy.

Researcher: Okay. And on a scale from 1 to 5, how satisfied were you with the process? So 1 being very unsatisfied, and 5 being very satisfied.

P7: I would go ahead and say 5. It was, oh, I am. you know, easy to walk through, like, I kind of just went through, said that, And it's integrated into the, you know, the VA.gov now, and not, like, a separate entity, which is nice. So, I would go ahead and say 5 again.

Researcher: Okay. And how do you feel about the length of the form?

P7: I think the length was, definitely sufficient. You know, there was… No, like, unnecessary things. It was just, like… You know, the topic, your question, and then, you know, your contact information. So, this is definitely sufficient.

Researcher: Okay. And is there anything that you particularly liked or didn't like about, kind of completing your question?

P7: I don't think there's anything I didn't like, I maybe would put the… Maybe the topic and the subtopic before the question, but, how, I mean, that's not really too big of an issue. I just, and then what I like is, I like it's just, you know, I like how VA just integrated everything into one thing versus having a site for My HealthyVet, and then having a site for your benefits, and then now, you know, having a site for AskVA, I like having… I just like how the, you know, the AskVA is now integrated with all the other things.

Researcher: Okay. And now that you've completed your question, what would you do next after… after this?

P7: I would, you know, I would probably just log out or, you know, close my browser out, and then I would period… I would probably periodically log back into my VA and just check the status of it. I… I would… And then, if I didn't, I would just maybe check it the next day or two. I… me personally, I probably wouldn't wait, you know, the 7 business days to check the status of it. I would… I would periodically check it, you know, beforehand… before that.

Researcher: And what would you expect AskVA to do next?

P7: I would expect a, like, an email confirmation that it, that ASBA did, you know, receive it. Or rather than having to write, like, this reference number down. I would expect, like, the email confirmation to have, like, that reference number located in it.

Researcher: Okay. Any other thoughts on this experience that, you just kind of walked through?

P7: No, not really. I mean, it's, like I said, it's, you know, pretty self-explanatory.

Researcher: Okay. Great. I'm gonna move us into our next task then, and I will be sending a second link in the Zoom chat, so if you're able to get back to the Zoom window, and pull up, either copy and paste it, or click on it and, kind of pull it into the browser here. Alright, so as that loads, I want you to imagine that maybe it's been a month or so since you submitted that question. Maybe you've submitted other questions through AskVA, and you're going back to check on that specific question that you asked about your work-study benefits. Show me how you would check on that question here.

P7: Yeah, so, I would, It looks like there's, you know, I've asked multiple, questions. So I would scroll down and look for, if it's, if it's under here, and then it looks like the, I had asked a work-study question, so it looks like this was it. So then I would, It says it's new, it doesn't look like there's been, like, a response or anything. But just to, review it, I would, click under View Details. And then go through here, and it does look like there was… response to… from the VA, and then I responded, so I could, you know, read the latest response from the VA. And then if I had questions. I would, go ahead and, you know, type in my reply to this specific question, and then if I had any other, documentation or anything, I would go ahead and add it in here, and then I would go ahead and, you know, submit my reply to As VA.

Researcher: Okay. And if you go back one screen, I'll have you maybe just go back from your browser, using the back button. I wanted to ask a couple questions about, what you see here. So, what pieces of your previous question are you looking for when you came here?

P7: Yeah, so, you know, work-study falls under the education category, so, I see that education, and then I also see, you know, work study is in the question. And then… say, I know, like. So that's kind of what I was looking for, in that thing.

Researcher: And what information is most important to you when you are looking for a previous question?

P7: I would probably say, like, definitely the category. Would be number one, just, if I knew I was… My question was work-study, and I know that falls under the education category. So, I would say that's definitely the most important. the date submitted, I know you, like I said, it's… it's been about a month, so I know it's… I maybe not remember the exact date, but I can remember if it's been about a month, like… I know, kind of like, maybe the date I submitted it definitely helps. And, I would say maybe, like, your question, and maybe being able to see, like, the whole question, like, if it's… like, I knew I, the question was work-study, and I can see it, but if, like, the work study was towards the end of the question. So being able to sift through, like, that specific keyword in the question, so I might… It's nice that the question's in here, but, maybe being able to see the whole question if I was trying to, you know, sift through that specific keyword.

Researcher: Okay. Is there any other… you kind of just mentioned this, like, maybe seeing the whole question, but is there anything else that would be helpful here to see in order to find the previous question?

P7: Not really, I don't think so.

Researcher: Okay. And what order are you currently seeing the questions in?

P7: It looks like… Looks like the date submitted, is the order.

Researcher: Okay. And what order might you like to see them in, if any other kind?

P7: I mean, maybe being able to, sort that, obviously, I see the, you know, this up here, but it doesn't really make… doesn't give you, like, a… a sort thing, so maybe, like, if I wanted to, like, flip this from, like, newest to oldest… I could do so. Or maybe even… maybe even able to, like, sort that for all these, if I know, like, all my questions prior to this, you know, this disability question. Obviously I could filter the ones that are still open, and then I would be able to sort, but… So being able to sort it would, if I was specifically, you know, knew that it was… This year, last month, or whatever.

Researcher: Okay. And I think you kind of talked a little bit about, maybe something related to that status column as well, and maybe… I don't know if you were talking about, like, filtering by that, or sorting by that, or maybe both. Just wondering if you could expand a little bit on that.

P7: Yeah, like, if I knew, like, all the… questions I had prior to this date, this September of 23, were solved, then I would, you know, I would just go ahead and filter the status to either, you know, the ones that are still apparently open. And then, you know, sorting it from there. And then, like. I mean, by doing that, I'm cutting out, you know. This one, and then all the ones on the second page, so it might be easier to, specifically look for the… why I was coming here in the first place.

Researcher: Okay. Now, as you think about, kind of reviewing your questions here, is there anything in particular that you liked or didn't like? on this page.

P7: I mean, I like that it's, you know, it lists the category and the date I submitted it, you know, it… It… list part of my question status, and the last time it was, like, if the VA, you know, responds, it lists, or if I reply, it lists the last updated. I would say what I don't like is that you're not able to view, you know, view the whole question. And then also, you're not able to, like, kind of sort These categories up here.

Researcher: Okay. Any other thoughts on this page?

P7: No.

Researcher: Okay. So, I'm going to… I'm actually going to be asking you to complete the same tasks that we just went through in a slightly different system. Some things may be similar, and some things are different. We really want to understand your preference between the two. So I'm going to go ahead and put another link in… the Zoom chat. So similar to what we did before, I'll have you click on that link, and as that one gets loaded, I will kind of give you your prompt again. Okay. So, just as we did before, I want you to imagine you're having an issue with your work-study benefits. You've been directed to AskVA to get help with this issue, so show me how you would use AskVA to get this help.

P7: Yeah, so I would, you know, go ahead and log into my, my VA, and then come to the Ask VA part. And then I would go ahead and select ask a new question. You know, since I'm signed in, it has my name, the last four of my social, my date of birth listed. I would verify that's all correct, and once I did, I would go ahead and select continue. And then… I'm coming here for education, you know, work-study-related questions, so I would click on the categories and look for that specific, you know, topic. I see that work study is listed here, so I'm going to go ahead and select that, and then go ahead and continue. And then, you know, once again, I'm, it looks like it brings up all education and work-study-related topics, and because I'm coming here for work-study specific, I'm gonna go ahead and select, work study, and then, continue on. And then kind of like the previous one, I'm not really sure, like, what these subtopics are, so I would just go ahead and select general, Because that kind of seems like the most, you know, broad out of the other ones. And then, I would go ahead and continue on. and then I am the veteran. I'm filling this out myself, so I would go ahead and select I am the veteran, and continue on. You know, I'm currently in Ohio, and my school's also in Ohio, so I would go ahead and select, you know, the school state. And then also, you know, my residency state, and then continue on. It looks like this brings up my contact information, and because I'm logged in, you know, I would assume that this auto-populates like it does. So I would, confirm this is my cell phone number, my email, and then I would continue on. And then… work, I know I'm coming here for work study, so in the subject, I would probably put work study, and then in this one, I would type in the payments. Oh, And then I would add, attach the, you know, the file in here, in this section here. And then once all that's done, I would go ahead and select continue. And then I would just go ahead and review, all this information is correct. And it looks like it is, so then I would go ahead and, submit my question. And then, you know, come to the, confirmation page here.

Researcher: Okay. So, on a scale from 1 to 5, how easy or difficult was it for you to complete this task? Again, 1 being very difficult and 5 being very easy.

P7: I'm gonna go ahead and say 5 again.

Researcher: Okay. And, similar question, on a scale from 1 to 5, how satisfied were you with this process? Again, 1 being very unsatisfied, and 5 being very satisfied.

P7: I'll go ahead and save Fiverr as well.

Researcher: Okay. Can you expand a little bit on, kind of rating these… this… this process a 5 for both of those?

P7: Yeah, I mean, it's, it's… I specifically knew what I was coming here for and what to do. I knew I was coming here for a work-study-related question, and it was easy to, get to and work through. Like, the previous one, it was, I could see if… if I didn't know, like, what my question was, it might be a little more difficult, but because… My question was work-study. It was, you know, it was… it was right there for me. So it was definitely easy to work through and get through to.

Researcher: Okay. And, was there anything in particular about this process that you liked or didn't like?

P7: The only thing I really noticed, was, I'll go back here, and, like, this one is like… if I'm… Already selected the topic and subtopic. For my question. I don't really necessarily think this subject is necessary. Because the subject should be, you know, work, study. or works, you know, education or work study. So I don't… that's… that's really the only thing I, really felt was kind of unnecessary, was, this having to do another subject. On top of, like, the… topics I've already selected.

Researcher: Okay. And was there anything in particular this time around that you liked?

P7: I mean, it's, it's, you know, like I said, it's easier to work through, so it's, and it's self-explanatory. It's pretty user-friendly, so…

Researcher: Okay. Any other thoughts about going through this process?

P7: No.

Researcher: Alright, we are going to move into our fourth and final task, and so I am putting a fourth link into the chat for you. And as that loads, yeah, so, now I want you to again imagine that you submitted that question maybe a month ago, and you're coming back to see the specific question and, check on… check on that question about your work-study benefits. So show me how you would check on that question here.

P7: Yeah, so I would, you know, go ahead and I would log in, and then I would, you know, come to the SBA section of it, and then I would scroll down. And I would kind of look for, you know, the keyword, or the category that my question was under. So I see that, you know, work study falls under education, I see this category as, you know, education, so then I would kind of browse through the… the question, and then I see work study, so I would… No, they say this was about, when I submitted it was about a month ago, so then I would know this is kind of, like, the question I was coming here to check the status on. So then I would go ahead and click Review Question. And I see, you know, see my question, my attachments, the initial response, my reply, and then the, I'm coming here, to see the response from my reply. And then I would go ahead and read it. And then I have a response to that question, so I would, you know, type out my reply here. if I had any other attachments, I would go ahead and, you know, click in there to add it, and then I would go ahead and, you know, submit my response.

Researcher: Okay. Now, if you go back to kind of where we were looking to get into a reply here, On this page, what attributes of your previous question are you looking for, again?

P7: Yeah, so I know that, you know, work study is under the education, so I'm looking for… you know… that keyword under a category. I could review all these other ones, you know, it's… And see that. Like, it's not… It wouldn't be under, like, these categories, these three categories. So then, and then I would… if that wasn't available, I would kind of just browse through the questions and look for the, work, like, a works, you know, the work study, or some, you know, some other form of, like, education, In the question itself.

Researcher: And what information is most important for you here?

P7: I mean, definitely the category. The submission date… And, you know, when it was updated, or when the VA replied, or when I replied to the VA, I don't necessarily think the reference number is necessary, because… I guess it could be if I have that reference number, in my email, and I know the reference number of my email is this, then I could be like. You know, compare my… the reference number in my email to, like, the reference number, but… I could also see on the… on the majority of the time that most people aren't gonna either save or write that reference number down. So, that's, you know, what I think is, works.

Researcher: And is there anything else that would be helpful for you to see here in order to find a previous question?

P7: once again, I would like to be able to see the whole question. So then I could kinda… hone in on, you know, if I'm… if I know it's a work-study-related question, what, you know, it… what if that work-study was towards the end? you know, Obviously, it says, like, I have 9, you know, 9 results, and there's no page 1, you know, why is it only showing, like, 4? But, and then also, I think a… a sort. You know, once again, you can filter, but you can't sort. So… I think that would be, an added benefit, being able to sort, not just filter.

Researcher: Yeah, and what order are you seeing these questions in now?

P7: I am not sure… I have no idea.

Researcher: Okay. And again, what order would you want to see these in?

P7: Huh.

Researcher: Outsorting, like, what… what order.

P7: Yeah, I mean…

Researcher: them in.

P7: Probably… probably either the submission date or the last updated date. If I know, like. you know, SBA responded, then, you know, then I know, like, or just responded, then it would show up under, you know, here. So either the submission date or the last updated date.

Researcher: Okay. And is there anything else that you particularly like or dislike about reviewing your questions this way?

P7: in… I would like, you know, kind of what I just, you know, previously touched on is, like, I, you know, I don't like there's no sort… option. It doesn't look like it's in any order. So that's, those are kind of the two things I don't like. What I like, it's just… that it does have, like, the submission date, last updated, you know, the overall category. I also don't like it doesn't show the whole question, so… but… Yeah, so that's.

Researcher: Okay. Great. So that was our last task. I have just a couple, kind of, follow-up questions, and in order to do that, I'm actually going to, take over sharing. Okay. So I will go ahead and share my screen with you.

P7: Should I stop sharing, then?

Researcher: I think I… I think I was able to just take.

P7: Can you see my screen? Yes.

Researcher: Okay, so today you got to experience two different versions of AskVA, kind of thinking about what it was like to submit a question. In this case it was about a work-study issue. I'm curious which experience you preferred. So, on the left, you can see just kind of a visual representation of the first, experience you had, and on the right, is kind of a visual indication of the second experience you had. Which one did you prefer?

P7: I would probably… I mean, they were so similar, but, I would probably say the first one. Oh, I'm… just the… I mean, the only major difference that I… Oh, it was, like, on the second one, I had, you know, like, a subject, which I thought was kind of unnecessary. So I would go say… go ahead and say the first one I like better.

Researcher: Okay. And a similar question, you also experienced two different versions of, of this page here that we see, kind of looking into a previous question. So, on the left, you see a visual representation of the first experience, and on the right, is kind of a representation of the second experience that you were just looking at. Which of these two did you prefer overall?

P7: I would, once again, probably say the first one. Just cause it looked like it was in some sort of order. The second one, it didn't really look like it was in any order, so I'll go ahead and say the first one again.

Researcher: Okay. And as you kind of think through, like, these two versions that you saw, is there anything overall that you would maybe change about your AskVA experience?

P7: Not really. I mean, just… just what I've already, you know, touched on was, you know, maybe adding a sort function and, you know, some things like that, but, that's really about it.

Researcher: All right. Well, that was my last question. I wanted to just circle back and reconfirm, now that we've kind of gone through the entire session, wanted to reconfirm that you were still comfortable if we were to potentially share, like, a video clip of this session, with our VA partners. We would remove any identifiable information before sharing that, and it's really just for the purpose of trying to improve these digital services for veterans. So I wanted to confirm whether or not you were comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session.

P7: Yes.

Researcher: Okay. Thank you for that. Well, with that, I will close this out then. Just really appreciate the time that you spent with me today, walking through and sharing your thoughts and your experiences with me. Your feedback was really helpful in order to help improve, this support channel for folks like yourself. The last thing I just wanted to mention, Paragene is, the group that recruited you, and they'll probably be sending you a thank you note, with a little blurb that you can pass along to other veterans. to potentially be involved in research studies like this in the future. So if you had a good experience kind of participating in this, we would love to get other veterans involved, in order to continue improving these services and these digital experiences.

P7: Alright.

Researcher: Before we close out, did you have any questions for me?

P7: No, I just, thank you for your time, and thanks for having me.

Researcher: Yeah, thank you so much, Adam. I hope you have a great day.

P7: Alright, you have a better day.

Researcher: Alright, bye.

P7: Bye now.
