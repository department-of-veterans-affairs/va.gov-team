Researcher: Awesome. It looks like it just started. So now that we have started the recording, can you go ahead and confirm again that you're OK with me recording today?

P14: Yes, of course.

Researcher: OK, awesome. Well, thank you for letting me go through kind of all of those expectations. I just wanna make sure we're aligned on on what you can expect today before I jump in. Do you have any questions for me?

P14: I do not.

Researcher: Alright, awesome. So I know we kind of came up on on this session pretty quickly in just the last like 24 hours. It looks like I might have lost her. Oh, OK.

P14: I'm so sorry.

Researcher: No problem.

P14: I thought I was exiting my team members messaging me and I was like, Oh my goodness. Let me get rid of that. No, and it was all of teams.

Researcher: Help me.

P14: So if you need to rerecord or me tell you again or whatever, I'm so sorry.

Researcher: No, no problem at all. I think I think we're we should be set.

P14: OK.

Researcher: So no worries at all.

P14: OK.

Researcher: I just wanted to get to know you a little bit better. And so I was hoping you could tell me a little bit about yourself, maybe. So obviously we know your name, but kind of talk about your role, maybe your years of experience in that role and I. Would love to understand whether or not you yourself are a veteran.

P14: Yeah, of course. So. I moved to Oklahoma. I didn't, really. Have my eyes set on, you know, helping veterans and their dependents getting their education. I thought my career goals would be completely different and in 2018 I met someone who dedicated their life to doing exactly what I'm doing. Being a school, certifying official, helping students in higher education navigate their VA benefits. And you know everything that comes along with that. So in 2018, I met someone in the office that I worked with, and I loved her passion that she had for students and helping them with all things, but specifically military veteran benefits. And there was an opening on her team. And I decided, you know, let's see if this is my calling. And so in 2018, I joined our military and veteran benefits team. Just as a school certifying official veteran certification specialist, whatever you may call it. I worked my way up to a coordinator position in our office and then now I am assistant registrar over all of certifications at OSU.

Researcher: Hmm.

P14: And that would be like our OSU main campus, so. I am not a veteran myself. My dad was a marine. My grandfather was a marine. My husband's family is very heavy military, but I'm not a veteran myself so. I always tell people, you know, you don't have to be a veteran to be able to care about veterans. So I feel very grateful that I get to assist students, military affiliated veterans, all of them. With their benefits and with their higher education experience.

Researcher: Awesome. Thank you for sharing. It really helps to kind of understand where you've come from and and made it into this role. So I would love to understand a little bit more about your role as a school certifying official. Can you kind of just like at a high level, describe your role and then maybe walk me

P14: Thank you.

Researcher: through what some of your processes are, especially your interactions with BA?

P14: Yeah. So we typically only come into play whenever students are receiving education benefits through the VA. So we have a separate office on campus that is connected to our registrar's office, that whenever a student comes to OSU, be it a transfer or first time student, and they have those military veteran benefits, whatever they may be, they find our office quickly. And we get connected with them to assist them with receiving. And the benefits that they have been awarded through the Department of Veteran Affairs. So we get students who are just starting out the process. They're not sure where they need to go. You know, they're like, hey, I think I have these benefits from my parent. Can you tell me if I would or where can I find this information or or things like

Researcher: Hmm.

P14: that? And then there's also some students that come in. They know exactly what they need. They brought their certificate of eligibility to our office and they said this is what I need. What do you need from me? How do we go? So we kind of have two different populations of students that that either come in knowing exactly what they want from our office and what they need from our office. And then some students who wander in, who they don't know what they need or how to get the benef. Started and so our office.

Researcher: Can I ask a quick question about that?

P14: And of course.

Researcher: I'm curious like at A at a university of your size like how many students are? Is your office serving?

P14: Yeah, great question. So we have certified 1500 students approximately this semester using GI Bill benefits. So chapter 30. Chapter 3133351606. Yeah. So approximately 1500.

Researcher: OK. Is that like a pretty common like average for a semester?

P14: It is not so. Our numbers have substantially grown over the years. I was just actually pulling the numbers. Pretty recently, within the last month, just to see like where were we at five years ago? Where were we at two years ago? And you know where we may have been 800 students back in like, 2022 or maybe closer to the 900 range. Like now we're looking at, you know, 1500 students now. Like look at this jump that we experienced. So it was interesting to see. But it has been a steady incline every semester. And my thoughts on that are, you know, maybe students are now coming of age to use the benefits that are either transferred to them or students are coming of age to use the benefit like the Chapter 35 benefit we have will have multiple beneficiaries of one veter. Using those benefits underneath.

Researcher: Hmm.

P14: Their for the Chapter 35 benefit. So just more and more students each semester. It's interesting to see what numbers grow. What numbers seem to kind of go down? But yeah, we have seen significant growth over the years. It's been an increase every semester.

Researcher: OK.

P14: Our fall semester is typically just a little busier than our spring semester and I'll know if it's just because new students coming in and then you know, maybe they graduate in the fall. So they don't come back in the spring or or something like that.

Researcher: OK.

P14: Yep, go ahead.

Researcher: And have you ever used askva?

P14: Oh yeah.

Researcher: OK. Can you talk a little bit more about how frequently you're using that tool or yeah, we'll start. We'll start there and kind of I might have some more probing questions for it.

P14: Yeah, yeah. So how frequently I'm using it has been more frequently since the government shutdown. In the past, it's just so much easier for me to call the SEO line and ask questions whenever they come up. And it's more of just an instant fix. But if it's something that I know is better for them to see in writing and respond to me in writing so that I have that documentation too, I will certainly choose. Ask Virginia so that I have that recorded response. I use ask Virginia for questions. We have had a lot of or I've had more submissions this past month and a half than I have in a while just because of the the phone lines being being

Researcher: Hmm.

P14: furloughed, but. I use it often for my questions that I might have. Most recently I have used it to ask on. I think one of my asks. Questions was a student status like, hey, this student was certified back in July. Can you tell me why they haven't received their benefits yet? And they can quickly tell me, oh, this was coded or in the system it's been fixed. They will now be receiving their benefits. So it's it was a quick fix for them. I have reached out to using the ASKVA system for a debt letter that I received that was incorrect so I could go in there and say like I received this debt letter and this e-mail. Believe that that should be this amount. Could you review that? And I use it for my work study program to submit my work study application to be a work site. My time cards, my applications and things like that.

Researcher: Great. Thanks for kind of giving me some context there. I guess I'm curious like let's say, maybe maybe on a normal month, maybe not on a government shutdown months about how often would you say you're submitting things through ask VA?

P14: I would say. At least a handful of times, because at the very minimum I'm submitting my time cards through there for my work study students. I've also used askva in the past to ask for like a list of debts for our institution. If you know for some reason we need something from debt management that shows the list of debts. But really I will use it if I ever think I need concrete written documentation from the VA for this student. You know, if I need something in writing that way,

Researcher: No.

P14: I know for sure this is this is it.

Researcher: OK. Great. Well, again, thank you for just providing some context to understand what it looks like in your world. At this point I'm going to move us into kind of going through and doing some scenario based tasks and so I'm going to first start by having you share your screen with us.

P14: Back.

Researcher: So if you're able to do that, it should be a share button up at the top right of the teams window. It's usually a rectangle with an arrow in it, and then I'm going to be sending a link in our team's chat. OK, great. So I can see your screen and I just sent a link to you. So hopefully that link should open up in the browser here.

P14: OK, you can still see everything.

Researcher: Yep, I can see your screen and I can see that link opening up. So I want you to imagine that you're needing to submit documentation on behalf of a student for their education benefits.

P14: OK.

Researcher: So before you click on anything, take a second to look around and just talk out loud about what it is that you're seeing here.

P14: OK. Yeah. So whenever I go to this page, it looks very similar to how I would normally do the ask.va.gov. I normally don't read any of this information up here because I already know that it can take, you know, seven business days for a response. I also already know how long it will take me to complete the form, so the information at the top I typically ignore because I am very familiar with the website. When I Scroll down, I can see the link that I need to submit. I'll click on the ask a new question link. And since I am not signed in. And it's not showing my previous questions. So normally my questions that I have already asked via on my personal account or my business account would show up at the bottom of the screen for me to refer back to, to check in on the status or or things like that. I could go back in and. Review my conversations that I already had at the bottom of the screen.

Researcher: And how would you normally get to this page?

P14: I just clickask.va. gov in my browser takes me straight here.

Researcher: OK. OK. So now kind of like I said, imagine you're needing to submit documentation on behalf of a student. Go ahead and show us how you would use SBA to submit your documentation.

P14: Of course. So I would click ask a new question and my browser whenever I'm first starting out and I clickask.va. gov whenever I click, you know, ask a question, it would have me sign in so I would sign in with my ID dot me go through. All that verification and then I would normally get to this page. And then I would click ask a new question. It's asking me to confirm if the information on file is correct. Know my social and date of birth haven't changed. So I'm not typically checking this personal information box too much. Kind of glance at it hit continue. Get answers to your questions. Select the category that best describes your question, so I will click the down arrow on that. I know that what I normally use is always going to be education benefits and work study because I'm always either submitting something on behalf of a student or on behalf of like my workplace for my work study students. So I'll click education benefits and work study. And hit continue. And then it's going to ask me a little more specific. What is it that you are going to be submitting to us today? So if I have a work study time card, I'm going to go down here to a work study and click on it. Let's say for this example. I have post 911 student in my office who needs me to submit something to the VA on behalf of them. So I could click post 911 GI Bill or I could click school certifying officials.

Researcher: Yeah. And before we move away from this page, I'm curious like, how do you interpret this list? And the previous list? What did? What do these two lists mean to you?

P14: The the first list I don't pay the most attention to because I know that anytime I'm using this system I will always use education benefits and work study. Because I'm not a veteran myself, the first list I would pay a little more attention to if. I was the veteran and maybe I had questions about, you know. Disability or anything like that. I could go in there and like review that list for the exact help that I'm going to need. This list. That I'm currently looking at is what I pay a little more attention to, and that you know what benefit are you specifically talking about? Is it something that you need to click on? School certifying officials work study now whenever I get to the screen I have clicked just post 911 GI bill like I have a question in that forum specifically. So for this one, would you like me to click school certifying officials?

Researcher: Yeah, maybe. Could you talk me through an instance where you would use the school certifying official option here?

P14: Yeah. So will it let me move forward?

Researcher: Yes.

P14: Like if I just needed to contact the VA based on like again, it's a little more difficult because I would normally just call the the SCO line and if I needed like a quick answer, I feel like most of the things that I have questions about are quick. Answers or you know if I know that the SCO line is going to tell me you need to

Researcher: Hmm.

P14: reach out to the ELR, I'll. I'll skip this whole step and reach out to ELR, or I'll reach out to the state approving agency. So. As far as like using the school certifying official specific. Big tab. Usually I will click on. It's normally post on 11 GI Bill that I'm having something that I need help with.

Researcher: Hmm. OK.

P14: And then the next screen is going to tell me you know, what's your relationship to the veteran. I always click. You know, I am connected to my veteran through work. The other options would have been, you know, if you're a veteran or you're the dependent. My role specifically as a school certifying official. So I will click that option and hit continue. And then search for my school. Normally this is pre populated for me. I could try to do that, but we're just gonna choose one of these. Yeah. So normally it would give me the option to. You know, this is school we have on file for you. Is this the information that you would like included on your question and I would continue but here do you would you like me to click on one of these?

Researcher: Yeah, that's fine. And actually wanna pause because there was a couple other questions I wanted to

P14: OK.

Researcher: probe on with and I actually might have us go back a couple of screens if you don't mind. Back to kind of looking at the the topics here. Yeah, I was curious if you've had experiences where you couldn't, you didn't have an option that fit your needs here?

P14: I wouldn't know because normally I will click work study if I have something specific for work study or I would click. I feel like my my if I didn't know exactly what I wanted to talk to, I would click school certifying officials. Otherwise, in the past I have just chosen the exact post 911 GI bill.

Researcher: OK. And how important is this list to you?

P14: Now I have. I think it's important because whenever I'm walking students through the same process, like if they need to go on, ask Virginia and request a new certificate of eligibility, or if they never got their Coe and they want to request it on here. Excuse me, I can easily tell them. OK, once you get to this stage, there is an exact list and you will be able to choose certificate of eligibility that specific. Uh topic is what you were looking for. Or if you know you have a question specifically about Montgomery Job selector reserve, you can click that one as well. So I feel like this list includes everything that would be needed to contact the VA.

Researcher: OK. Great. Thank you for kind of coming back here and and just letting me probe a little bit more on that. So go ahead and kind of continue walking through as you were.

P14: Yeah. OK. I am school certifying official. I am specifically school certifying official in this instance. Normally my school information would pop up. But here is this one I can hit continue. And it says, you know, your school facility has been this. Yes, I want to do this or no. I want to update my. I don't typically see this screen. Is this just because I'm? In demo mode or.

Researcher: Yeah. How do you? How does this screen? What does the screen mean to you?

P14: Yeah, this is strange because I would halt and be like, whoa, whoa. Nothing has changed. My school facility code should still be the same, so I would be hesitant to replace my school facility code. I would hit no, don't update my school's facility code so we'll see where this takes me. Prefilled some of your information. This is a normal screen. I normally see just your contact information, your phone number, e-mail address, preferred name. If you put that in there before. I'll hit continue and then this is the normal screen I would see whenever I need to USBA. So do you want me to continue with what I would do from here?

Researcher: Yeah. So you won't necessarily be able to type into these two particular fields, but I would love for you to talk out loud about either examples of things that you have maybe put into the subject or the question field in the past and really love to understand like.

P14: Yeah.

Researcher: What what differentiates what you would put in the subject versus the question field?

P14: Yeah, so this may go back to the submit a question days. Very, very long time ago, before Askva was here. Where you don't put specific information into certain fields, so that's just kind of been ingrained in me. A lot of times. All use work study. For example whenever I submit my question to work study to submit a timecard my subject. Is always my agreement control number. That's specific to the students. That unique number that is on the contract of each student who are receiving work, study benefits my subject, I always put that agreement control number and then if it had, if it's an extension of that agreement control number, I'll put that on there. As well, but the subject I leave it at that. And in my mind, it's easier for the processors or study processors to be able to. Locate and tie this to that student. And their previous submissions, if I can easily put the subject in there as the agreement control number for them to easily look it up. In my question box, I typically type in for a work study submission, submitting a timecard for first name, last name, and then I always put in the last four of their social. So I'll put like *** dash **. Stash 1234. And then I usually say thank you and I will either choose the file or drag the file there. I've used both options. More recently I have been dragging the file because it's a lot easier for me to download the scanned signed card from my e-mail. I just download it quickly into my folder, then I keep them in and then it's just easy to drag that folder over. Or that file over into. The file upload portion of that screen. So more recently I've been using the drag file. Option in that, but you can certainly just hit choose from a folder. It will take you to your folders and then you will select which file you would like to upload.

Researcher: Yeah. So as far as your the agreement control number like is that like putting that into the subject? I'm curious like how you store that information. So how you like capture that information in order to enter it here?

P14: So it's on the time card. So whenever my, you know my work study and I I sign off on their time card, they will scan it and e-mail it to me. I will download it from my e-mail and as I am saving it I have it, you know, pulled up so that I can see what what the agreement control number is on my time card and just place it into the subject line. And it also tells me what. The last four of their social is so that I have that information for the next box

Researcher: Hmm.

P14: as well. So use the time card information while plugging the information into ask VA.

Researcher: OK, great. Yeah, I think that that. Yeah. So you can go ahead and kind of walk me through any of the questions that I was gonna have. So you can go ahead and go through and finish a submission here as you normally would.

P14: OK. So if I had put everything in these boxes, I would well. There you go. This is what it would look like. I would put my subject submitting documentation blah blah blah continue and then it allows me to review everything that I have. Put into this system, which I appreciate because a previous version of askba like it wasn't this detailed in your review and submit. So I appreciate being able to look at, you know, category everything that I had already selected. I can make sure before I hit submit that I. Didn't accidentally click. You know I'm the veteran or or anything like that. Has my school information. I can verify that that's correct. I can verify everything like this is, although I should have verified that along the way I can do a quick double check and then I always make sure that my attachment showed up and that my question and subject are there and then I'll hit submit. And then after I hit submit, I very quickly get an e-mail confirmation with my confirmation number which is a date code and then a six digit confirmation after that and I file that in my e-mail. Should I need to refer back to it later? I've never had to refer back to it later because I can always click on my askba home screen and. Check the status of something as it's being processed. So after I get to this screen that says we have received your submission and I received my e-mail confirmation, I hit return task VA.

Researcher: OK. So on a scale from 1:00 to 5:00, how easy or difficult was it for you to complete this task? And one is very difficult and five is very easy.

P14: I would say 5. It walks you through every step. There's not really room for question.

Researcher: OK. And on a scale from 1:00 to 5:00, how satisfied were you with this process, one being very unsatisfied and five being very satisfied?

P14: I would say 5. Very satisfying, especially as someone who used to operate in the submit a question platform ask VA is light years ahead of that and it is very user-friendly.

Researcher: And how do you feel overall about the length of the form that you just completed?

P14: I feel like if I was complaining it on my own and not, you know, in a slow demo manner, I complete it very quickly. So even if you know I receive a time card at 4:55 and I need to go in and submit it, you know, by 5:00, I can log in, have them quickly submit it to me, and quickly go in and submit that still be able to.

Researcher: Thank you.

P14: Leave on time.

Researcher: And how do you feel overall about the order of the questions that you completed here?

P14: The order is great. So whenever I'm going through and submitting a question, it feels like the questions are in an order that makes sense with my thought process of my submission. I feel like every order question. Is easy to understand, so you know, once I click into that education benefits and work study. I know that the next thing that I see will be specific to what I need to be thinking about. In education, benefits and work study. So even if I was a student going in to submit this information, and I know I have questions about my education benefits, I won't get confused and overwhelmed by options because by clicking that I can easily find on that next screen either what chapter I am or what. Specifically, I have a question about.

Researcher: OK. And you kind of talked about what you would do after submitting. What would you expect? Ask VA to do next.

P14: I would expect ask, ask BA to send my question or response or what my question into a queue. In my head, this is what happened. So it goes into a queue like a working queue and it would be a queue that is specific to each category that I indicated all my questions. So. In my mind, the form that I just submitted would go into whatever queue that I selected whenever I was looking. So under school, certifying officials and I would expect someone from the VA to. Be working in that school, certifying official box per SE and be going through those and they order and responding as they can. Same thing with work study if I submitted it to work study, I would expect it to go over to a work study processor. If it was a time card or or things like that like that's, I expect it to go to whatever area of the VAI indicated on my question submission and then it be put into a queue for processing.

Researcher: OK. And you kind of talked a little bit about this, so like thinking about this specific question that you submitted, like if it was a work study or if it was like an education question, what might prompt you to return? To look into that specific submission again.

P14: Yeah. So I do that frequently. I do get an e-mail whenever there is an update. You know, if the status is changed or if you know there's been a response and I need to log in and review it. So I will go back and refer to those. Frequently I will go back to refer to them if they haven't been processed yet, just to see you know, how long has it been since I submitted that knowing that it was kind of backlogged? This past month and a half, I didn't have very high expectations of turn around time, but I was pleasantly surprised that the turn around time wasn't outrageous. And then if I have received a response in my e-mail that says you have something you know in your askba account, you know a response has been posted or whatever, I'll always login to ask VA just to make sure that that response is especially for time cards I. Again and just make sure that that response is that you know it's been worked and put into their file for processing and it's not something like a. There was a math error or something like that.

Researcher: Hmm.

P14: I should get an additional e-mail which I did actually recently get an. E-mail that said like, oh, there was a math error On this date. Please correct and resubmit so it's helpful to get that extra e-mail that

Researcher: Hmm.

P14: says like hey there was an issue and it needs to be fixed to be resubmitted.

Researcher: OK, great. I'm gonna move us on to our second task. And with that,

P14: Yeah.

Researcher: I'm going to be putting another link into our team's chat. So if you're able to navigate back into teams and grab a new link, that should open up again in the browser. So in this instance I want you to imagine that maybe you have had there has been an issue with a previous submission that has prompted you to come back and and review that submission. So go ahead and show us how you would check on that submission using SCA.

P14: Yeah. So the screen that shows here would be what it would look like after I log in and I would Scroll down and I have a business and a personal. Uh tab, so all of my questions typically follow under this business tab, I'm always doing something on behalf of my business since I'm not the veteran or using any type of military affiliated benefit then I don't typically use the personal tab. So I stay in the business tab. And I can Scroll down and see a list of my questions that are either solved in progress. This one shows a reopened case. I don't know that I've had a reopened case or a new submission, so I can click here to say and tells me when did I submit it? When was there last an update reference number category and what the question was. So this quickly and easily tells me on my home screen you know. Now maybe this one and this one are work study affiliated. This one was a question I sent on behalf of a student and this one was, you know, asking to renew my worksite. So I can see everything on the same screen and I can see where we're at when I submitted them, when it was last updated. The submitted date will stay the same based on when I submitted the question initially, last updated will update. To the day that there was a response. So if the VA came back in and said like, hey, this has been worked and processed and et cetera, then it would show the last updated as that date that someone was last in that conversation. So if I click on review conversation, it will tell me or remind me 'cause you know, sometimes we can forget or remind me. Well my question was. It will remind me as the attachments that I. I included. I can even click on the attachments and bring them back up. So for example, if I submitted a time card to the VA, they said, hey, there's a math error. Can you review this? I could go back and easily see what I attached previously to make sure that you know. Oh, I see the math error now. I'll go back in and correct it. It will tell me.

Researcher: So for the sake for the sake of time, I'll just pause it real quick. I am going to have you go back to the previous screen.

P14: Yeah.

Researcher: And I think you should be able to use the back button in your browser. And we're going to add some probing questions. It was great hearing your thought process as you landed on the screen. I was hoping you could tell me a little bit more about like what the business versus personal tabs mean to you or how you've used those in the past.

P14: Well, I don't know what happened.

Researcher: Yeah, I think I lost your screen there for a second.

P14: Yeah, it's. Something's not working. Let me maybe because I have two of them open. Let me exit those and I'll go back and grab it again.

Researcher: OK, OK. OK. Yeah, it looks like it's loading again. Weird.

P14: I don't know if it's 'cause. I had both of those links open at the same time or what. The difference between business and personal like I could picture myself if I was the veteran too. So I have a veteran employee who may use Askva for his own, you know, like personal things. Like if he has questions on his own, you know, disability status or his own benefit or something like that, he could keep that separate. He's also a worksite supervisor for work study. And so he can keep his personal things that he has communicated with the VA on a separate tab than the business side where he would be acting as like a supervisor and an employee, the university.

Researcher: OK, so for you as someone who is not also a veteran, do you have any use cases for that personal tab?

P14: I do not, no. I noticed whenever it changed to this newer uh, the newer ask VA uh,

Researcher: OK.

P14: it had filed some things under personal or business that maybe I just didn't pay attention to whenever I was initially asking my question. But yeah, I don't. I don't really have a reason to use the personal. I always try to put them under business to keep them all in the same space.

Researcher: OK. Yeah, it looks like the that link is not loading.

P14: Let's get it.

Researcher: Yeah, I'm not sure what happened there.

P14: Oops, Sam.

Researcher: Yeah, we try one more time.

P14: There it is.

Researcher: Oh, here we go. OK. So yeah that thanks for giving me some more perspective on the business and personal tasks. I'm curious. You did talk through this, but like what specific parts of your question are you looking at for like as a previous submission? So whether there was an error, you got a response like what are the types of things that you're coming here and looking for in order to review a previous submission?

P14: So I am looking at the status so this bar here that shows like solved in progress new reopened. I'm looking to see if they say in progress or solved. I know if they're new, if I just submitted them. I'm looking like I could have submitted multiple time cards at the same time. I'm not going to remember the different reference numbers,

Researcher: Hmm.

P14: so I'm looking at what I put in. In the body, so I refer back to the words that are in this. What would actually be like the body of your e-mail or of your question, not the subject. Because or maybe this is the subject here, right? Yeah. So this is the subject. But I'm going through and seeing like, OK of this student. What am I waiting on? Did they approve the student's time card? I'm still waiting on this one. Or have I heard anything back about? But you know the student who had received their benefits. But you know, everything was corrected. Did I hear anything back about? Hey, this debt letter doesn't appear to be correct. So like when I'm scrolling on this site, I don't have to open review conversation too many times just because I already can see right here what? Like the the gist of what that question would have been. So.

Researcher: Is there anything missing here that would be helpful for you?

P14: Since I use. Yeah. So I'm trying to see is if this is. What it's showing? Is the subject. Here I'm so. Right. Is that right?

Researcher: What would you want to see there?

P14: I keep the I would. I don't know if this is the subject showing here these words, or if it is the full body or like. A. I don't. I can't like whenever I click on this it's in a different language so I don't know. Again.

Researcher: What would you prefer to see there on that in those cards, would you? Yeah.

P14: On this card, I would prefer to see like a like. Part of the body of the message. And that's just because whenever I type in the subject, I'm usually pretty vague. I put more of the like sensitive information into the body of the message, not the subject. And so for me, the way I do my work study submissions is in the subject. I would put the agreement control number, but I don't. I'm not going to remember a student based on their agreement control number. So if it's only showing me the subject right here. Then I'm gonna have to click on the conversation to see which student was about. I believe on mine, if I remember correctly, the information that's right here is part of the body. So but this looks like a subject, so I'm not.

Researcher: Hmm.

P14: I'm not sure what's being shown here, but it would be useful for me to be able to see the body of my question.

Researcher: OK. And what order would you like to see your questions here?

P14: In submitted order like my newest one here and then going back. It doesn't want me to click these, but yeah, probably newest first.

Researcher: OK.

P14: Yeah.

Researcher: Next task, we're actually going to have you complete the same tasks in a slightly different system.

P14: OK.

Researcher: So some things may be very similar to you and others may be completely different. So we want to understand your overall experience between the two.

P14: OK. Yeah, of course.

Researcher: So again, I'm going to provide a new link in our chat, so I'll have you bring that link up again. And as that one loads, just as we did before, I want you to imagine that you needed to submit documentation on behalf of a student for their education benefits.

P14: OK.

Researcher: So you've been directed here to do this. Show us again how you would use SBA to submit your documentation.

P14: OK. So after I log in, this is the information that I would see. I would click ask any question. And this is confirming that my information is correct. I'll give this a quick glance and hit continue. Oh. OK. And then I guess I would. Write my question. OK. Hold on. I make sure I don't skip a step because that will be my first thought is how does it know what I want to submit? OK. Ask a new question. My information's correct. OK. Maybe I type in something here and hit continue? Is it guessing my category? K. Maybe we'll click education benefits. And work study. Continue. Oh. OK. OK. Let's click here. Continue. OK. Then I will choose my document continue. OK. I am connected as a school certifying official. I am the school certifying official search for my school. Like that continue. Now I don't want to update the one that's in my file. My information continue. How strange.

Researcher: Can you tell me more about that sentiment that you're feeling?

P14: OK. Yeah, I feel like in the past the way SBA is set up now, it is set up like a thought process. So like I need to tell the VA who I am and what I need this to be submitted under before I'm actually telling them my question. So like I need to tell them like you know it is me. I am submitting it on behalf of a student. My specific question falls under this. General category and then and then I want to have my question all in one area. So like now I'm ready to give you the information that I need you to have. My subject would be. Student benefit, mitigating circumstances and my, you know, my message could say, the student just provided me with mitigating circumstances and asked me to submit it on their behalf. I've kept a copy of this in their file, but I wanted to submit it on their behalf and then I would go and grab a copy of that mitigating circumstances and put it together that way. Everything in my message is all in one space. And I didn't put like my question over here and then like my attachment here and then there is no subject which may not be needed. I I think I could do without the subject line. Time, but I just feel like the question being way over here and everything else being over here with like attaching and stuff like that. It seems a little more all over the place. Than in the past where it seems like it's very streamlined and like in the line of your thought process, whenever you're going in to submit this. And to be honest, I don't know if that's just because I'm used to the system the way it is. And I know what questions. Is to look for next and in my mind it is in order of how my thought process works. If I was a new student coming in to use it, I may not have any opinions. On the way that it works, but I think that if I was to log in and it just like boom, what's your question? I feel like I've missed something already because I didn't even tell them like who I am, and I'm gonna go back just a little bit. 'cause. That was wild to me. I haven't told him. Like what? School. I'm even like to me, telling them all the information first before you get to it doesn't let me go back. Whatever at work setting. Yeah. So I mean all the information is still here. So I could go in. It would take me longer this way to verify what I have submitted because it's not in the order that I would expect.

Researcher: So on a scale from 1:00 to 5:00, how easy. Or difficult was it to complete this task?

P14: I would say it was difficult because I had so many questions. And I was confused on the drastic changes. Five is easy, one is difficult, or which one is switch.

Researcher: Yeah, one is very difficult and five is very easy.

P14: I would say we're out of three. I mean, I don't think that it's impossible. I just doing it the way that I've been doing it and I'm used to doing it made sense to me and this way kind of jumbles things in a different order that I didn't follow very well.

Researcher: And on a scale from 1:00 to 5:00, how satisfied were you with this process? So one is very unsatisfied and five is very satisfied.

P14: I'll go back with three because again, if I was to continue to use this, then I would get used to that. This is the new way of submitting things. Do I prefer the old way better? Yes, I like having one area where I'm submitting all of my stuff and writing everything in and then everything else is. You know, I'm selecting what category and area I want it to be directed towards.

Researcher: Yeah, I wanted to probe a little bit on that. You mentioned something when you came to see those categories this time around about like predicting. I was curious like what your thought process was when you were saying that?

P14: Yeah, it's almost like if I was using it as a new user or as a student. If I were to submit my question. I my my first thought was like, oh, is it going to predict for me based on my question which area I need to select? So maybe if I don't know which one to choose, is that first? Ask your question here. Gonna say like, oh, it sounds like you need help with this area. Because like that would be one of the only benefits that I initially can think. Gov. To put your question first, before you go through all the proper options.

Researcher: And how do you feel about something like that?

P14: Something like what? Like.

Researcher: Like having it predict a direction for you.

P14: I feel like maybe that's where we're at with the Internet in general is it's trying to figure out what it is that you're wanting to know. So I wouldn't feel strange about it reviewing my, you know, reviewing my question to say, like, oh, it sounds like you're looking for questions about this 'cause. I feel like that's a typical chatbot response and maybe it makes it a little less personal. You know, like whenever you. Going in here, submitting it if it's a chat bot in here who's like guessing what you want, but. To me, I would think like, you know, if I'm going in and I put my question 1st and then it gives me options, my mind is just thinking like, oh, is this are these options based on what I wrote? Would there be different options if I wrote something different?

Researcher: OK. OK. And I guess just maybe to close out that point, what you were kind of just walking through is how, what would you expect it to do with the question first?

P14: But the question first, I almost expect it to be like oh, it sounds like, you know, based on your question, choose from these options like. It's it to me it's saying like based on what you wrote here, these are the options that we think fit your question.

Researcher: OK. Great. Thanks for expanding on that a bit more. So we've got one more task and I know we just have 5 more minutes,

P14: That's right.

Researcher: so I am gonna go ahead and move us into that last task. So again got our 4th and final link in the chat. And as that pulls up, I kind of want you to again imagine that you're coming back to review a previous submission. So show us how you would check on a previous submission here.

P14: OK, so I can ignore the top because that's if I would have a new question if I needed to check what was in the past. I like this format a lot better than the boxes. Even if it's still just showing four, I feel like it shows the information a lot better. I don't necessarily need the category, but I appreciate them putting that on there. I like that the date submitted is all here. This looks to be in date order as well, so newest at top and then going oldest. The check mark the timer and the star are nice. Next to the status of, you know, new star. Solved. Green check like green, you're good. Reopened or in progress. There's a timer on it like, hey, we're working on that right now. You have a reply. Is another thing that would catch my attention if I was logging in here and maybe I missed my e-mail, but I'm like man, I haven't seen anything about the student forms that I submitted for John Smith. Oh wait, they're waiting on me. View details so I like this layout better. Personally than the boxes.

Researcher: And is there any information that you think is missing here that would help you to find a previous question?

P14: No, I don't know if this search box is included in the previous. I don't remember seeing a search box, but I may not have been looking for it, so that's nice. If it's there, that's new, that's great. But if it's always been there, I guess I maybe have just never needed it. I know that the.

Researcher: And what would you want to search for with that search box?

P14: Probably a name like a last name. If I would have included that like in my question, well I would have included in my question. So like if I was looking for Nancy Juris enrollment forms and I haven't heard anything, but I've submitted so many things I may type over here in my search box drew. And then I would expect it to show me. Any question that was submitted that contained drew in the question.

Researcher: OK. Is there anything else? You've talked a lot about things that you liked and and seeing it this way, is there anything in particular that you don't like about seeing your previous questions this way?

P14: No, I think that this looks great. The only thing that it would probably be useful for other people, it's just would I use it for versus what other people use it for? The category of education. I wouldn't necessarily need to know that. But everything else, it looks great. I like the exact date and time here of one of his updated because if it was the same day thing or something like that it would show me the time here. I don't necessarily need the time. I'm submitted here on date submitted, but to me it could be a little bit different or a little wonky to have date submitted just the date, last updated date and time. So I guess maybe just for the sake of. You know, mirroring that format, the time could be included there as well?

Researcher: OK. So that wraps up my last task. I do have some kind of closeout questions that I'm gonna try to get through here

P14: OK.

Researcher: pretty quickly and I'm going to actually take over sharing my screen with you. So let me do that here real quick. OK. Can you see my screen? OK. So you were able to experience two different versions of of ask VA today. So which of these versions did you prefer for submitting a question and documentation? So the one on the left is kind of a representation of the first experience that you had and the one on the right is representing that second experience that you had. Which one did you prefer?

P14: I prefer the one on the left where I get to pick a category before I submit my question.

Researcher: OK. And I did have just one quick follow up question in that last experience that we had with the putting your question in first, I'm curious we're talking through kind of if it showed you some options for category afterwards, what if what would you do if it didn? Show you an option that matched your question or that at least would match what you were trying to do.

P14: I would be confused if I was in the right spot. Like if someone said yeah, log in to ask VA and you'll log in and it'll do this. That or whatever, if I put my question in and then nothing

Researcher: Hmm.

P14: matched, I would probably, I don't know, just exit out and see if there was somewhere else I was supposed to be to be doing this. Like did I click a wrong button 'cause? That's what I initially thought. Whenever we immediately went to your question, I thought, oh, did I accidentally like double click and I missed something or or something like that. I would just question if this is the right space that I'm supposed to be. Asking those questions.

Researcher: OK. And just one more question here. Yeah. So you also got to experience two different versions of being able to review a previous question or submission. So on the left we have that first experience you had and on the right was the experience. You were just looking at between these two options. Which version did you prefer for reviewing a previous admission?

P14: I prefer the one on the right. I like the list option better than the big squares. I feel like my questions are all in the same column and I appreciate like the neat tidiness of it, and I also appreciate the search function as well. I was thinking I hadn't seen that before. I appreciate the ability to be able to search for a question that I've submitted. If for some reason I can't remember like. Oh, I remember. I turned in my worksite application, but it's lost. In all of these things I could type in like worksite application to the search bar and it could take me to the last time that I would have submitted that.

Researcher: OK. OK. Yeah, that was really my last overall question, I guess. Just thinking holistically about all the things you saw today. Was there anything in particular that you really liked or that you really didn't like?

P14: I really liked the list with like the columns and the rows. I feel like it is very neat and easy to keep up with, especially if you are someone who comes at it from a work side. Know if I was a student using it, I probably wouldn't care either way. How it shows up because I probably have only reach. Out to them one or two times, but for someone who has submitted multiple askva questions. On different things, it's nice to have them all in a list like that. I feel like it's a lot more readable. I did not like the question 1st and it could be like a because I use it for work. Maybe if I was using it as a student and I immediately just want to throw my question out there. In my thought process the other like the previous where you like select your category, select who you are, select your affiliations like this. I feel like doing all of that first makes sense and then it's like what's your question? Give it all here. Whereas if I was asking my question first, I would think that the the topics and categories that come after that go with my question. It's almost like an unbiased like you're clicking these other things before they

Researcher: OK.

P14: even know what you want to know about. Versus like,

Researcher: Hmm.

P14: if I if I put my question out there first is everything tailored to that question.

Researcher: OK. Awesome. Well, I know we are a past time, so I want to be respectful of your time and just I think go ahead and close us out. So I just want to thank you so much for taking time today again. Right before you go out for the holidays too. I really appreciate you spending an hour with us and being candid about your feedback and and exploring some of these. These different features of SBA with us. Do you have before I close this out? Do you have any questions? For me.

P14: I don't think I have any questions. I appreciate ask Virginia and what it has to offer and it was very easy during the government shutdown to, you know, I reached out to my students and I said if you need to contact the VA, like all hope is not lost, you can do so here underst. That, you know, responses aren't going to be immediate like they would be if you call, but you'll get a response in writing, and they can appreciate that. And you know, so I pointed all of my students to that platform. To use just so that one they know it's there 'cause. I think a lot of times they forget that that's an option that they know we live

Researcher: Hmm.

P14: in a society that's instant gratification. You know, we wanna call and get the answer. Right now, we don't wanna wait seven business days and so I think the wait time usually deters students from using it. But the written responses I think are the biggest positive of askba. So, but I appreciate that platform still being available to students. During things like government shutdown, especially if we go back into this in January, students having a Peace of Mind and knowing that they have a way to contact the VA for whatever it may be, not just their education benefits, they don't feel like they're just like left you. Know and not thought about and and whatever.

Researcher: Yeah.

P14: So they can still feel like they matter and that they can still get an answer to their questions.

Researcher: Awesome. Well, thank you for all of that input that gave us so much insight into your process so that we can continue to make improvements on this tool. So I just really appreciate your time today and I hope you have a great holiday next week. So thank you, Chelsea.

P14: Yeah. Thank you and thank you all. I hope you all have a good holiday too.

Researcher: All right, bye.

P14: All right, bye.
