## **Background** 

Our team is getting up to speed on the research that has been previously completed. This document ties previous research findings to decisions and tickets that our team has in our current backlog. This page will highlight those connections to identify where we still have gaps to explore in the research.

## **Overall Summary & Conclusion**

After reviewing the research these are our key findings:

* **Account separation:** Separation of personal and business accounts is needed, and while prototypes included separate tabs, it’s unclear if this persisted; post-launch feedback shows Business users face challenges, but self-reported data doesn’t fully capture their experience.  
* **Testing Ambiguity:** Because the [Aug 2024](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/design/User%20research/2025-10%20Form%20and%20Inbox%20Usability%20Study/Prior%20Research%20Assessment.md#aug-2024---dashboard-assistive-technology-testing) testing was completed in staging, it's unclear if the inquiries were still separated at that point.  
* I**ncomplete Insights:** Post-launch feedback highlights some challenges Business users face, but because it’s self-reported, we don’t have a complete understanding of how they are actually using the new VA.gov tool or navigating these issues.

### Previous research details

| [September 2023 \- Dashboard Workshop](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/ask-va/design/User%20research/2023-09%20Dashboard%20workshop) |
| :---- |
| **Summary:** The goals of this research are to understand what information users need when logging into Ask VA and viewing inquiry details, when and why they filter or sort inquiries, and how they prefer to view business and personal inquiries. |
| **Methodology:**  This workshop was conducted with 2 SCOs.  |
| **Insights on Key Findings:**  Emails help an SCO know when a status has changed, and triggers them to sign in and look at their dashboard. [See more.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/design/User%20research/2023-09%20Dashboard%20workshop/Insights.md#when-do-you-check-on-an-inquiry-how-do-you-know-when-you-receive-a-response) SCOs feel strongly that business and personal inquiries should not be mixed at all. Unfortunately, current credentialing makes it impossible to separate these completely, unless you sign in with a different account for each function. [See more.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/design/User%20research/2023-09%20Dashboard%20workshop/Insights.md#how-should-business-or-personal-inquiries-be-distinguished) |

| [May 2024 \- Dashboard](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/ask-va/design/User%20research/2024-05%20Dashboard) |
| :---- |
| **Summary:** The goal of this research is to understand how submitters locate their questions in the dashboard and what information they need when reviewing their question details. |
| **Methodology:**  Testing was completed with 7 Veterans and 3 SCOs. Prototypes showed both Personal and Business sections.  Next steps included additional research on assistive technology users |
| **Insights on Key Findings:**  The question and category fields help users quickly scan and identify specific inquiries. [See more.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/design/User%20research/2025-10%20Form%20and%20Inbox%20Usability%20Study/Prior%20Research%20Assessment.md#:~:text=Question%20and%20category%20provide%20keywords%20that%20help%20people%20skim%20and%20identify%20particular%20items.) Education business submitters often organize their inquiries by student name. [See more.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/design/User%20research/2025-10%20Form%20and%20Inbox%20Usability%20Study/Prior%20Research%20Assessment.md#:~:text=Education%20business%20submitters%20organize%20their%20inquiries%20by%20student%20name.) Most users immediately recognize this as the place to view their previous questions. The dropdown sorting feature is intuitive and easy to use. Displaying the Business tab first saves a step and helps keep Personal questions out of view. Users would benefit from being able to find inquiries by category now and through keyword search in the future. |

| [Aug 2024 \- Dashboard: Assistive Technology Testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/ask-va/design/User%20research/2024-08%20Assistive%20technology%20-%20Dashboard)  |
| :---- |
| **Summary:**  This research aims to understand how to transition Ask VA (AVA) to VA.gov in a way that makes it mobile-friendly, accessible, and seamlessly integrated into a cohesive, user-centered support experience. |
| **Methodology:** Testing included 9 Veterans. We recommend future studies with other user types, such as SCOs. Because testing occurred on Staging, it’s unclear which version was tested \- specifically whether the inbox/dashboard still separated Personal and Business inquiries. |
| **Insights on Key Findings:**  Findings were not specifically relevant to improve the experience for Business users. |

| [May 2025 \- Sep 2025 \- Feedback and Metrics Report](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/AskVA/Shared%20Documents/General/Data/Other%20analyses/Metrics%20+%20Feedback%20proposed%20template.pptx?d=w90ba3b257b364da7bfc2338776c98692&csf=1&web=1&e=eUbf7E&nav=eyJzSWQiOjI4NywiY0lkIjoxMjUyNzI3OTg4fQ)  |
| :---- |
| **Summary:**  This effort is a monthly review of the qualitative feedback reported by users on [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) related to Ask VA. This first report reviewed all feedback post-launch (May 21, 2025\) through September. |
| **Methodology:** Review of qualitative feedback from the Medallia intercept survey and the feedback button on the bottom of each page. (Filtered by the AskVA URL path that these feedback mechanisms are received from) Each piece of feedback is tagged by pain point theme and sub theme.  |
| **Insights on Key Findings:**  Login friction \- Veterans and Veteran families experience complicated login processes, while Submitters experience conflicts between their business and personal credentials Overcomplicated inbox \- Reviewing responses and submissions is challenging for Veterans and Submitters Submission inconsistency \- Submitting documentation for business line processes, varies, causing confusion and incorrect submission. |
