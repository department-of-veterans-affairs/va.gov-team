# Desk Research Review 

## Background
Our team is still getting up to speed on the research that has been previously completed. So I wanted to directly tie previous research findings to decisions and tickets in the backlog. This page will highlight those connections to identify where we still have gaps to explore in the research. 

## Synopsis

## Improve the inbox experience for business users ([#1905](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/ask-va/issues/1905))

- _What do we know about the inbox experience for business users in the past and in the current experience?_ 
- _Why do they need to find previous inquiries?_

### [May 2024 - Dashboard](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/ask-va/issues/1905)
#### Summary: 
- Testing was completed with both Veterans (7) and SCOs (3)
- Prototypes showed both Personal and Business sections

#### Relevant Key Findings:
2. Question and category provide keywords that help people skim and identify particular items.
3. Education business submitters organize their inquiries by student name.**

#### Additional insights
1. Most people immediately understand that this was where they can find their previous questions.
3. How to sort using dropdown list is well understood.
7. When business tab is first, it's saves an extra click and helps hide personal questions.

#### Recommendations:
1. Make it easier to compare last date updated with date submitted.
2. Help people find items based on category (now) or keyword search (in the future).
3. Remove 'New' status and start with 'In progress' to lessen confusion.
4. Change 'Solved' status to 'Closed' or 'Replied' to clarify intent.
5. Recommend plain language overhaul of responses from VA.
6. Move 'Your question' to 'Your conversation' and 'Send a reply' to the last item on the page.
7. Add print button to question details page.
8. Reiterate that a question has been 'Reopened' on the reply confirmation page.
9. Add 7 day turnaround time to subtitle on unauthenticated and auth homepages.




### Inbox takeaways
>- Findings and recommendations do not explicitly address why users, specifically SCOs, may be looking for previous inquiries.
