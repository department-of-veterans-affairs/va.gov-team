# Desk Research Review 

## Background

### [May 2024 - Dashboard](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/ask-va/issues/1905)
Summary: 
- Testing was completed with both Veterans (7) and SCOs (3)
-  

Key Findings:
1. People use date last updated and status to find items that have a reply or should have a reply soon.
2. Question and category provide keywords that help people skim and identify particular items.
3. Education business submitters organize their inquiries by student name.
4. It can be confusing deciphering between new and in progress, but reopened and solved are well understood.
5. There's an expectation that inquiries marked as solved by VA will not actually feel solved for Veterans.
6. It's more intuitive to read and save a conversation that's in chronological order.
