- Previous form research

## Background
Our team is still getting up to speed on the research that has been previously completed. So I wanted to directly tie previous research findings to decisions and tickets in the backlog. This page will highlight those connections to identify where we still have gaps to explore in the research. 

## Gaps in understanding
### Inbox:
- The need for separation of personal and business accounts and inquiries was clear since the research back in [Sep 2023](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/design/User%20research/2025-10%20Form%20and%20Inbox%20Usability%20Study/Prior%20Research%20Assessment.md#sep-2023---dashboard-workshop).
- The prototype tested in [May 2024](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/design/User%20research/2025-10%20Form%20and%20Inbox%20Usability%20Study/Prior%20Research%20Assessment.md#may-2024---dashboard) still included separate tabs for Business and Personal inquiries
- Because the [Aug 2024](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/design/User%20research/2025-10%20Form%20and%20Inbox%20Usability%20Study/Prior%20Research%20Assessment.md#aug-2024---dashboard-assistive-technology-testing) testing was completed in Staging, it's unclear if the inquiries were still separated at that point.
- Based on the [post-launch feedback](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/design/User%20research/2025-10%20Form%20and%20Inbox%20Usability%20Study/Prior%20Research%20Assessment.md#may-2025-sep-2025-feedback-report), we have learned a bit about the challenges that Business users are currently experiencing, but it is unclear how they are interacting with the new tool on VA.gov to workaround these challenges. This feedback is self-reported and is not the clearest picture into understanding the user's holistic experience.

### Form length:
- 

## Improve the inbox experience for business users ([#1905](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/ask-va/issues/1905))

- _What do we know about the inbox experience for business users in the past and in the current experience?_ 
- _Why do they need to find previous inquiries?_

### [May 2025-Sep 2025 Feedback Report](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/AskVA/Shared%20Documents/General/Data/Other%20analyses/Metrics%20+%20Feedback%20proposed%20template.pptx?d=w90ba3b257b364da7bfc2338776c98692&csf=1&web=1&e=eUbf7E&nav=eyJzSWQiOjI4NywiY0lkIjoxMjUyNzI3OTg4fQ)
#### Summary
- Three related themes of feedback surfaced out of the post-launch feedback (Medallia survey and feedback button):
  - Login friction
    > Why are all of my professional business inquiries as a School Certifying Official recorded as "Personal" inquiries and tied to my SSN?
  - Overcomplicated inbox
    > Check the status of VA Work Study submissions. The submissions UI doesn't automatically sort by date of submission, it is not readily clear on how to do that either, and it doesn't show more than 4 submissions at the same time, which doesn't help me accomplish my task in an easy way. I appreciate the new UI for the submissions, but I need to be able to see the status of the submissions without having to dig through 5 separate pages.
  - Submission inconsistency
    > I came to see where I can submit educational documents from using the GI bill. Im using it for the first time and I have no clue how much Ill get or what documents I need to submit to show my grades or where they need to be submitted.  

### [Aug 2024 - Dashboard: Assistive Technology Testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/ask-va/design/User%20research/2024-08%20Assistive%20technology%20-%20Dashboard)
#### Summary: 
- Testing was completed with only Veterans (9)
- Since the testing was completed on Staging, it's unclear what version was being tested. Specifically whether or not the inbox/dashboard still had Personal and Business inquiries separate.

#### Relevant Key Findings:
- Findings were not specifically relevant to improve the experience for Business users.
  

### [May 2024 - Dashboard](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/ask-va/design/User%20research/2024-05%20Dashboard)
#### Summary: 
- Testing was completed with both Veterans (7) and SCOs (3)
- Prototypes showed both Personal and Business sections
- Next steps included additional research on assistive technology users

#### Relevant Key Findings:
2. [Question and category provide keywords that help people skim and identify particular items.

3. [Education business submitters organize their inquiries by student name.

#### [Relevant Insights:](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/design/User%20research/2024-05%20Dashboard/Findings.md#additional-insights)
1. Most people immediately understand that this was where they can find their previous questions.
3. How to sort using dropdown list is well understood.
7. When business tab is first, it's saves an extra click and helps hide personal questions.

#### Relevant Recommendations:
2. Help people find items based on category (now) or keyword search (in the future).

### [Sep 2023 - Dashboard Workshop](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/ask-va/design/User%20research/2023-09%20Dashboard%20workshop)

#### Summary
- Workshop conducted with 2 SCOs
- Next steps informed Phase 1 MVP, but next steps lead to a broken link.

#### Relevant Insights
- [When do you check on an inquiry?
](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/design/User%20research/2023-09%20Dashboard%20workshop/Insights.md#when-do-you-check-on-an-inquiry-how-do-you-know-when-you-receive-a-response)
  - Emails help an SCO know when a status has changed, and triggers them to sign in and look at their dashboard.

     > I personally don't go in to Ask VA daily. I would only peek in if I'm looking for something specific or if it's been a while and I can't remember getting an email.

- [How should business/personal inquiries be distinguished?
](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/design/User%20research/2023-09%20Dashboard%20workshop/Insights.md#how-should-business-or-personal-inquiries-be-distinguished)
  - SCOs feel strongly that business and personal inquiries should not be mixed at all. Unfortunately, current credentialing makes it impossible to separate these completely, unless you sign in with a different account for each function,
    > I wish it could be separated at the login.
  - We also learned that,
    > it defaults to personal
  even if you aren't a Veteran or beneficiary, so some SCOs have business inquiries in their personal dashboard.
