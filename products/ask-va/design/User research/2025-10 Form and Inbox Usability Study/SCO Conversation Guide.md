# Intro \- 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today\! My name is **Elena**. I have my teammate, Danielle, here to help us take notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them I have a few things that I want to go over with you about what you can expect from this session. 

- Today we're going be talking about a digital support channel for Veterans and other submitters.

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.  
    
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.  
    
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate will not affect your benefits or standing with the VA in any way. If you would like to stop the session or don’t want to answer a question for any reason, that's no problem. Please let me know.  
    
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**  
    
  - **If no:** Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.  
  - **If yes:** Admit observers.  
  - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to **give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov.** (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)  
  - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth


- During part of our session today, **you'll be interacting with a prototype.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. We will also be providing you with an account specifically for testing, so you will not see any of your own personal information. 

- Because we want to learn more about how you’re experiencing our digital tools, **I will ask you to talk out loud** about what you’re seeing and how you’re feeling about what you’re seeing.   
    
- Also, we want to understand how you might interact with these tools **if we weren’t here watching you.** So if you ask me questions, I may not answer them during the session and we can come back to them at the end. I may simply ask you “How you might expect something to work?” in return.   
    
- **Are you comfortable if I record today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are safely deleted, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.  
    
  - **Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record your video, audio, and your screen when you screenshare?**


  \*\*\[Record answer here\]\*\*


  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**

**Start recording.**

## Warm-up Questions \- 10 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a couple warm-up questions.

1. Describe your role as a School Certifying Official.   
2. Walk me through your overall process as a SCO, specifically noting how your role interacts with Veteran Affairs.   
3. Have you used Ask VA in the last 6 months?  
   - If yes, can you describe your most recent experience with Ask VA?  
     - How frequently are you using Ask VA?   
     - How many submissions are you completing a week or month?  
   - If no, move on to tasks

Now we’re going to move into the next part of this session. I’m going to provide you with a few scenarios and tasks. Let's start by having you share your screen with us.

## Task 1: Submit Education and Work Study Question \- 15 minutes

*Goal: Learn about problem areas in submitting the form for education requests from SCOs.* 

> [!NOTE]
> Depending on which Group a participant is in (A or B) they may go through staging or the prototype first. 

**Staging**  
You’ll need to login through ID.me. I've provided a link, email, and password for you in the chat. You can click through the additional login screens after your password to get to where we need to start. 

**Prototype**  
I've provided a link for you in the chat. Imagine that you've already logged into your VA.gov account. 

[Link available here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aDnIBf45PX0PtCS0inuKdzuyuuGfAs8jZdpbqpCAs8Y/edit?tab=t.xqc68vb3ppax#heading=h.8naf3b6w1yra)

##

Now imagine, you’re needing to submit documentation on behalf of a student for their education benefits. You’ve been directed to Ask VA to submit your documentation. Before you click on anything to complete this task, take a second to look around and talk out loud about what it is that you’re seeing. 


- As you’re seeing this (for possibly the first time),   
  - What are your expectations from Ask VA?  
  - How long would you expect it to take to complete your task through Ask VA?
 
Now show us how you would use Ask VA to submit your documentation. 

#### Probing questions:

- **Categories/topics**  
  - How do you interpret the lists you’re seeing? What do they mean to you?  
  - How important do you think these questions are?  
  - What would you do, if you couldn’t find an option that fit your needs?  
- **School Facility**  
  - What does the school facility mean to you?

- **Question**

  _(IF STAGING)_ Feel free to type in anything that you normally would here for this kind of task.   
  _(IF PROTOTYPE)_ You won't be able to type anthing into this field, but talk outloud about what you might want to type in here.   

  -  *(IF STAGING)* How did you determine what to write in the subject field vs. the question field?
  - What information do you think is important to include in your question?  

- **Attachment** \- Can you describe a time where you would or wouldn’t attach something to your question? 

#### Things to watch for:

- Where did they struggle, succeed? (Categories, topics, sub-topics?, attachments?)

- Did they complete the task? 		

  *Yes, Yes with help, No*

#### 	Follow-up questions

- On a scale from 1-5, how easy or difficult was it to complete that task?   
  	*1 being very difficult, and 5 being very easy*

- On a scale from 1-5, how satisfied were you with this process?   
  	*1 being very unsatisfied, and 5 being very satisfied*

- What did you like about using Ask VA to submit documentation? What didn’t you like?   
- What would you do next after submitting? What would you expect Ask VA to do next?
- What differences might you expect when completing the form as a Veteran rather than as an SCO?
- What might prompt you to return to Ask VA related to this specific submission? Is there anything in your process that leads you back here?

## Task 2: Review Question in Inbox \- 5 minutes

*Goal: Learn how SCOs expect to review their previous submissions and their status.*

> [!NOTE]
> Participants will complete Task 2 in the same environment they completed Task 1. 

**Staging**  
You’ll need to login again through ID.me. I've provided a link, email, and password for you in the chat. You can click through the additional login screens after your password to get to where we need to start. 

**Prototype**  
I've provided a link for you in the chat. Imagine that you've already logged into your VA.gov account. 

[Links here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aDnIBf45PX0PtCS0inuKdzuyuuGfAs8jZdpbqpCAs8Y/edit?tab=t.xqc68vb3ppax#heading=h.8naf3b6w1yra)

##

Now let’s imagine, **\[Prompt from last question\]** and you need to review a previous submission. Show us how you would check on that submission using AskVA. 


#### Probing questions:

- **Inbox**  
  - What attributes of your submission are you looking for?  
  - What information is most important from what you see here?  
  - Is there anything else that isn’t here that might be helpful to you in finding your previous question?
  - What order are you seeing your questions in? What order would you like to see them in?


#### Things to watch for:

- Where did they struggle, succeed? (Sort, filter, status, clicking a card)

#### 	Follow-up questions

- What did you like about reviewing your previous Ask VA submissions? What didn’t you like?
- What differences might you expect when reviewing questions related as a Veteran rather than as an SCO?


Now we’re going to ask you to complete the same tasks in a slightly different system. Some things may be very similar, while others may be completely different. We want to understand which experience you prefer.

## Post-Task Interview \- 5 minutes
You got to experience two different versions of Ask VA today. The one on the left represents the first experience you had and on the right represents the second experience.

- Which of these experiences do you prefer for submitting documentation? 
- Which of these experiences do you prefer for reviewing a submission?

[Links here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aDnIBf45PX0PtCS0inuKdzuyuuGfAs8jZdpbqpCAs8Y/edit?tab=t.xqc68vb3ppax#heading=h.8naf3b6w1yra)

- Why did you choose that version?   
- If you could change anything about the Ask VA experience, what would it be?

## Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.  
    
  - **If yes:** Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?


  \*\*\[Record answer here\]\*\*

## Thank-You and Closing \- 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks\! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day\!
