# Form \+ Inbox Research Plan

**Ask VA, Form \+ Inbox Usability Testing, October 2025**

# Background

Ask VA is comprised of a contact form and inbox where Veterans, family members, and other submitters can get answers to any VA question and submit documentation. Ask VA is available to both authenticated and unauthenticated users. The frontend integrates with a backend customer relationship management (CRM) application that routes questions to the appropriate VA team. Multiple VA teams can access and use the CRM.

In this research we are specifically exploring Veteran and business (education) submitters' input on how well the current Ask VA form and inbox are working to meet their needs. We hope to uncover opportunities to reduce the burden of the form and improve the inbox experience.

## OCTO-DE Priorities

`Objective 1: VA‚Äôs digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.`

`Objective 2: OCTO‚Äôs platforms are the fastest, most efficient, and most secure way to deliver products at VA.`

## Veteran Journey

* `Getting Out`  
* `Starting Up`  
* `Taking Care of Myself`  
* `Reinventing Myself`  
* `Putting Down Roots`  
* `Retiring`  
* `Aging`  
* `Dying`

## Research Goals

### Goals

`1.` Understand Veteran and business users‚Äô needs from the Ask VA form and inbox. 

`2.` Identify opportunities to simplify the form and inbox to better meet their needs. 

`3.` Assess satisfaction and ease of use of the current Ask VA experience versus our exploratory prototype. 

### Outcome

---

This research will create a shared understanding of the different mental models that submitters have in walking through the form and reviewing responses in their inbox. This will enable our team to make future design decisions that will enhance the Ask VA form and inbox experiences. 

More specifically, we will be able to determine a forward design path to enable all submitters better access to their previous submissions. We will also be equipped with evidence when designing business lines‚Äô requested changes to the Ask VA form.  

---

### Research questions

`1.` What are submitters‚Äô expectations with the Ask VA interface and process?  

`2.`What are the biggest problem areas with the form for Veterans? For business submitters? 

`3.`What are the biggest problem areas with the inbox for Veterans? For business submitters? 

`4.`How are submitters working around these problem areas? 

### Hypotheses

---

Business submitters have to use workarounds to get the information they need from Ask VA.

Using Ask VA to submit education and work study documentation is overly burdensome to business submitters.  

Veteran submitters expect a simple contact form allowing them to ask any question. 

Veteran submitters don‚Äôt understand the internal routing processes to get their question to the right person.
