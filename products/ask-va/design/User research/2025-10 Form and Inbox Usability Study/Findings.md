## Research Goals
Ask VA is comprised of a contact form and inbox where Veterans, family members, and other submitters can get answers to any VA question and submit documentation. Ask VA is available to both authenticated and unauthenticated users. The frontend integrates with a backend customer relationship management (CRM) application that routes questions to the appropriate VA team. Multiple VA teams can access and use the CRM.

In this research we are specifically exploring Veteran and business (education) submitters' input on how well the current Ask VA form and inbox are working to meet their needs. We hope to uncover opportunities to reduce the burden of the form and improve the inbox experience.

## Research Questions
`1.` What are submitters’ expectations with the Ask VA interface and process?  

`2.`What are the biggest problem areas with the form for Veterans? For business submitters? 

`3.`What are the biggest problem areas with the inbox for Veterans? For business submitters? 

`4.`How are submitters working around these problem areas? 

## Methodology 

**Research method:** Usability testing  
**Moderation style:** Moderated \- facilitator led  
**Location:** Remote over Zoom  
**Timeframe:** 60 minutes


## Hypotheses and Conclusions
| Hypothesis | Evidence | Conclusion |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Business submitters have to use workarounds to get the information they need from Ask VA. | | |
| Using Ask VA to submit education and work study documentation is overly burdensome to business submitters. | | |  
| Veteran submitters expect a simple contact form allowing them to ask any question. | | |
| Veteran submitters don’t understand the internal routing processes to get their question to the right person. | | |



## Key Findings

*Summarize the 5–10 most impactful findings from your study.* 

> [!TIP] 
> Write findings as stand-alone insights that are easy to scan. For example:  
> - "Most participants used the search field to locate forms, often searching for 'veteran health.'"  
> - "Participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form."

>    - Enter: "I want to convert these spreadsheet cells into a table in markdown:" 
>    - Copy and paste the cells from the recruitment checker spreadsheet that you've filled in
>    - Copy the resulting markdown table by clicking the copy icon in the Copilot chat, and paste it into this report below
