## Research Goals
Ask VA is comprised of a contact form and inbox where Veterans, family members, and other submitters can get answers to any VA question and submit documentation. Ask VA is available to both authenticated and unauthenticated users. The frontend integrates with a backend customer relationship management (CRM) application that routes questions to the appropriate VA team. Multiple VA teams can access and use the CRM.

In this research we are specifically exploring Veteran and business (education) submitters' input on how well the current Ask VA form and inbox are working to meet their needs. We hope to uncover opportunities to reduce the burden of the form and improve the inbox experience.

## Research Questions
`1.` What are submitters’ expectations with the Ask VA interface and process?  

`2.`What are the biggest problem areas with the form for Veterans? For business submitters? 

`3.`What are the biggest problem areas with the inbox for Veterans? For business submitters? 

`4.`How are submitters working around these problem areas? 

## Methodology 

**Research method:** Usability testing  
**Moderation style:** Moderated \- facilitator led  
**Location:** Remote over Zoom  
**Timeframe:** 60 minutes


## Key Findings
**1. Finding 1:** Veterans (77% of inquiries) and business submitters (19% of inquiries) have very different use cases for the category/topic, subject, question, and attachments. ​

**2. Finding 2:** Both submitters, but primarily Veterans, need reassurance throughout their experience with Ask VA to ask their question “correctly”, so that it gets them the answer they are searching for. ​

**3. Finding 3:** The list view aligned more closely with users’ mental models and supported easier navigation

**4. Finding 4:**​ Business submitters need different fields in their inbox than Veterans do

## Details of Findings 

### Finding 1: Veterans and business submitters have distinct needs with the Ask VA form 
**Category:**
- As a Veteran, without the category and topic to frame my question I would feel less confident and confused that I’m submitting a question in the right place. (7/9 participants)
- As a Veteran, the list of categories and topics is helpful, but also long and overwhelming. (4/9 participants)
   - _Supporting data: **P6:** "I like the, the detailed drop-down box with all the information in it. I think it narrows—it really helps seeing that you're getting directed to the right place." (Veteran)_


- As a Business Submitter, my category never changes, but I am required to enter it anyway. (4/4 participants)
   - _Supporting data: **P3:** "It is tedious to do. Click, click. Click. Click, click when every single time it's the same thing." (Work Study Site Supervisor)_

**Subject:**
- As a Veteran, the subject field is redundant to the category and topic, but I am required to enter it in anyway for education submissions. As a Veteran, the subject field is redundant to the category and topic, but I am required to enter it in anyway for education submissions. (6/9 participants)
- As a Business Submitter, I primarily use subject to identify the student I am submitting something for, but the subject field is not reflected in the inbox. (4/4 participants)

**Attachments:**
- As a Veteran, I want to be able to include attachments related to any question I ask, but that’s not possible on all categories. 
- As a Business Submitter, most of my submissions include attachments and I use the question field as a description of my attachment. (2/4 participants) 
  
### Finding 2: Submitters needs reassurance that they are asking their question "correctly", so they can get what they want which is the answer to their question.
This was observed throughout our research more specifically with Veterans. The burden is on Veterans to correctly navigate the Ask VA form to ask their question. If they choose something incorrectly, it may increase the response time and/or decrease the quality of the response they receive. 
- As a Veteran, I need a simple way to correctly and confidently fill out all the information the VA needs to answer my question.
- As a Veteran, I want to make sure my question gets to the right team to ensure I get a timely and quality response. 

### Finding 3: The list view inbox aligned more closely with users’ mental models and supported easier navigation.​
Participants (Veteran and business) indicated that a list format made it easier to scan, sort, and find information.
- As a Veteran or Business Submitter, I want to be able to clearly and quickly view my questions, but the card formatting makes it difficult to understand order, content or status.
   - _Supporting data: **P4:** "I can follow it easier because of the way it's laid out…In an orderly fashion categories, Submitted date, question, status. You know, updates and details. Instead of trying to go through one block versus another block. Trying to figure out what's going on there, so I can see everything." (Veteran)_
- As a Business Submitter, I have different needs for the inbox than a Veteran. 

- _Supporting data: 5 of 9 Veterans and 4 of 4 business submitters preferred list view._

### Finding 4: Business submitters need different fields in their inbox than Veterans do​
Veterans want to search by keyword and category/status. Business submitters look for student name and reference number (not always surfaced in inbox).

---

## Additional Insights
### Finding 5: Business users need longer inbox history and better identification for submissions
Business submitters conduct audits and need to refer to old submissions, but limited history and poor surfacing of identifiers (e.g., student name) make this difficult.
   - _Supporting data: All 4 business submitters reported using inbox for audits/records and cited limits on history as a pain point._

### Finding 6: Business users all experience challenges with the way they receive responses from Ask VA
The email responses from Ask VA are not helpful in determining an inquiries' status, which requires them to go into the system for each "response"
   - _Example: "Is the response that the time card was received and is being processed? or is it that the time card was submitted incorrectly and needs to be updated?_

Tickets are also closed before a business submitter can respond. Forcing them to open a new ticket and putting them at the back of the queue. This can cause financial hardships for students.​

## Recommendations
#### NOW (Near-term / In scope)

### 1. Keep categories first in the flow
- **Related finding:** Different use cases for Veterans and Business Submitters  
- **User story:** As a Veteran, without categories or topics to frame my question, I feel less confident and unsure whether I’m submitting my question in the right place.

### 2. Reorganize the categories and topics taxonomy
- **Related finding:** Different use cases for Veterans and Business Submitters  
- **User story:** As a Veteran, the list of categories and topics is helpful but feels long and overwhelming.

### 3. Research which Veteran-used categories do not allow attachments

## Next Steps
Now (in paralllel):
- Define Business flow
- Small inbox changes
- Expand width of inbox filters/search (with cards)
- Add sort (with cards)

Next:
- Design Business flow
- Design Listview inbox

## Further research needed

### Research Gaps

- Better understand how Agents use the different fields submitted in the form​
   - How can we streamline categories and topics based on agent processes? ​
   - Explore statuses and response processes​
   - Learn business rules about attachments for different categories ​
   - Learn business rules around submission history on inquiries​
   - Understand subject use in the backend​
- Business vs. personal ​
   - Explore the potential for more information to be stored within a “business profile” for AVA​
- Usability testing after enhancements have been designed​
