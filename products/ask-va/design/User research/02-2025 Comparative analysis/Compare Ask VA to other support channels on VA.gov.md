## Purpose

### Research goals

- Review how support channels are described and distinguished from one another
- Review how teams measure the success of each support channel (where possible)
- Review the steps required to receive help from each support channel

### Outcome

This will help us articulate when people should use Ask VA instead of another support channel. And consider whether we need to design better seams between Ask VA and other channels. It will feed into product vision exercises we plan to do with partners.

### Methodology

1. Identify channels to compare.
2. Review support experience of each channel.
3. Compare to Ask VA.

## Analysis

I will review the following support channels:
