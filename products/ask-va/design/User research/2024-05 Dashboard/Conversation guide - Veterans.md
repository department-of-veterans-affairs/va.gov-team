## Intro (5 minutes)

> Start transcript: `LIVE TRANSCRIPT` > `ENABLE`.

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Tyler]. How are you?

I’m a researcher from VA. I work on improving VA.gov so it's easier for Veterans to contact VA online if they have a question.

**What I hope to do today** is get a sense of how we can make this process better.

**What I don't want to do** is add to any frustration that may have led you to contact VA - or even frustration you've had with actually contacting VA - in the past. I want to be up front and say that I don't have a way of fixing those past experiences. But, I do want to know about your frustrations in case they're things we can improve in the future.

So before we get started, when Perigean set up this session, they asked if you’re okay with a couple of observers joining us. This helps my team members learn from our conversation as well, and they also help me take notes so we capture everything you share.

**I want to confirm now, are you okay with a couple of my teammates joining us to observe?**

- `IF NO` Use Slack to let observers know.
- `IF YES` They're in the waiting room, so I'm going to let them into the meeting now.

> Let in observers from the waiting room.

Welcome. Can everyone say hello? This is `PARTICIPANT`.

**Thanks everyone, now I’ll ask you to turn off your cameras and mute yourselves for the rest of the session.**

There are a few other things I want to mention before we start:

- **This session should take about an hour.** I’ll make sure we finish on time, so I may occasionally move us along during the session, so we can cover everything.
- **We’re here to learn your honest opinions.** Negative feedback is helpful too, because it helps us learn how we can improve.
- **I also want to make it clear that we’re not testing your ability.** So, for example, if I ask if you understand something, it’s because I want to make sure writing is clear.
- **I’m going to share a prototype with you today.** This is like a test version of the website, so it may not work exactly how you expect. For example, you’ll be able to click some buttons, but not all of them. Also, if the prototype says something like, "you have a 70% disability rating," that's pretend information. I don't want it to alarm you if you read anything, because it's all just made up for the purpose of this session.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, you just have to let me know.** And that might be a pause to get some water or to stop the session completely. You'll be paid even if we don't complete the full session.
- Last thing is about recordings. We can record the session to help us confirm we captured your opinions accurately and sometimes share video clips with our colleagues at VA. If we do this, we don’t link anything you share in the session to any information that could identify you. We remove your face and your name from the videos. **Knowing this, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
  - `IF NO` Don't record
  - `IF YES` Once I start recording, I’ll confirm again.

> Start recording: `RECORD TO CLOUD`.

I’ve started recording. I'd like to confirm again: **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?**

## Warm up (5 minutes)

It seems like we’re ready to get started. I'd like to begin by learning more about your experience with the VA and our online services.

- I'm curious, how long have you been a Veteran?
- Have you ever contacted the VA online or over the phone?
  - `IF NO`
    - Why might you contact the VA?
    - If you were going to contact the VA, would you prefer to call, go online or get in touch another way?
  - `IF YES`
    - Can you tell me about a time when you contacted the VA?
    - How do you usually contact the VA? Why?
    - How was the support you received?

<details>
  <summary>Key things to notice</summary>

- Why do they choose to contact VA (instead of going elsewhere or doing another task)?
- How do they decide which channel to use when they contact the VA?

</details>

## Set up (5 minutes)

- Have you ever heard of Ask VA?

`IF YES` Okay, great. Can you tell me about a time when you used Ask VA?

`IF NO` Okay, no problem. I'm going to show you Ask VA on my screen for a moment.

> Share screen with [Ask VA](https://ask.va.gov/ask-a-question/).

**IMPORTANT: EXPLAIN ASK VA**

This is Ask VA. Ask VA is an online tool that Veterans can use to ask a question. You can ask questions about all different topics, like health care or housing assistance, for example.

Today, we're going to pretend like you're kind of familiar with Ask VA. Let's say, you've used Ask VA to ask a couple questions at this point.

So, now I'm going to stop sharing my screen. And we're going to shift gears.

In the Zoom chat, I'm going to send you a link to a prototype. I mentioned earlier a prototype is like a test version of a website. It might not work perfectly and we're going to be pretending like the information in the prototype is yours. 

> Send link in Zoom chat.

* [Prototype - Veterans, Desktop](https://www.figma.com/proto/QiGqccQi4jIFXuQ9AMh0Sx/Ask-VA-Prototype-R3?node-id=86-113153&t=iofC6kYKXWHuPxCY-1&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=44%3A97142&starting-point-node-id=86%3A113153)
* [Prototype - Veterans, Mobile](https://www.figma.com/proto/QiGqccQi4jIFXuQ9AMh0Sx/Ask-VA-Prototype-R3?node-id=86-103005&t=m7chNSIuvBg5Ov3i-1&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=4%3A3&starting-point-node-id=86%3A103005)

- Can you open the link in the chat?
- Have you shared your screen on Zoom before?
  - `IF YES` Great. Can you please share your screen?
  - `IF NO` I’ll walk you through how to do that…

Thanks! Now I’m able to see your screen too.

> Screen: Dashboard

And so, taking a look at your screen. We see that we're on Ask VA and we're pretending like you're signed in. Pretend like this is your account.

<details>
  <summary>Key things to notice</summary>

- Are they familiar with Ask VA?

</details>

## Dashboard (20 minutes)

So, first off...

- Can you describe this page to me? What are you noticing?
- What are these boxes?
- What do these dates mean? What days are those referring to?
- What does this mean, where it says, "Health care"?
- What does 'New' mean?
- What does 'Solved' mean?
- What is this text here, that says, "How do I access Secure Messaging on the VA website?" What is that text?

Okay, so I think it's clear now that these are 3 questions that we're pretending like you submitted to the VA.

- Do any of these questions have a reply from VA yet?
- Which question might have a reply? Why?
- If there's not an easy way to tell which one has a reply, what would you do?
- Does the status help you understand whether there's a reply?

Okay, and let's say you remembered that the VA gave you some information about home loans and you signed in to re-read their response.

- How would you find that question about home loans?
- Are you able to search? How?
- Are you able to sort the order of these cards? How?

Okay, so at this point, let's say that you want to check whether there's a reply for this `Solved` question you asked on `May 21st`.

- Without clicking yet, can you tell me where you would click next?
- What do you expect to happen when you click 'Check details'?

Alright. Let's go ahead and click 'Check details' now.

Alright, so now we're on this page.

- First, can you describe this page to me? What are you noticing?
- Is this what you expected to find on this page?
- Is anything missing?

If you'd like whether there's a reply...

I'll give you a minute to read their reply.

- What are your thoughts, after reading this?
- Is their reply what you expected?
- If you had a follow-up question, can you reply back to the VA?

- If they can't reply to VA, what would they do if they have an issue or follow-up question?

</details>

Okay, so it does seem like you can reply to the VA...

- Without clicking anything yet, can you describe how you would reply here?

Great. Well, we can't actually type in the prototype today. But let's click on that box where you would type, and we'll pretend like you typed in your reply.

> Screen: Reply drafted

So, now we see your reply has been drafted.

- What would you do next?

Great. Let's go ahead and click send.

> Screen: Reply sent

I'll give you a minute to read this page.

- Can you summarize this page for me?
- Is anything missing from this page?
- How do you get back to the Ask VA homepage from here?

<details>
  <summary>Key things to notice</summary>
  
- Do they notice the status changed from 'Solved' to 'Reopened'?

</details>

## Cool down (5 minutes)

Okay, we’re all finished with the prototype. So you can stop sharing your screen now.

> Stop sharing screen

I’d love to spend a little time reflecting before we finish.

- What did you think of that process? Is there anything you liked?
- Is there anything that could have been easier?
- Let's say you wanted to tell another Veteran about Ask VA. How would you describe it to them?
- If they needed help finding their reply from the VA, what would you tell them?
- Is there anything else you want to share with me, about this process?

<details>
  <summary>Key things to notice</summary>
  
- What did they like and what would they change?

</details>
   
Well, I think you've answered all of my questions.

Thanks again for sharing your time with me. It’s been so helpful to learn from you.

**Do you have any questions for me?**

Okay, well thank you so much for the time.

Perigean will send you a thank you note with some information that you can pass along to other Veterans if they’d like to participate in future research sessions. 

I hope you have a lovely rest of the day.

## Pause or exit strategies

We can use this strategies to prepare for difficult situations.

### If the participant isn't feeling well

I'm sorry you're [not feeling well]. Do you feel up for continuing? You'll be paid even if we stop early.

> If they choose to continue...

Okay, just let me know if you change your mind.

### If the participant is showing signs of upset or distress

This sounds so hard. Would you like to take a break or stop?

> If they choose to take a break and come back...

Welcome back. I'm interested to hear more about [topic you left off on]. Are you up for continuing or would you prefer we move to the next topic?

### If the participant decides to stop

Thank you for your time today, I completely understand your decision to stop.

> If they seem distressed...

Before you go, the VA Hotline number is 988, it's a confidential helpline, and it's 24/7. It's up to you whether you call.

### If the participant is fine to continue, but you aren't

I hear that you're okay to continue. Before we do, I realized that I need a minute. I'm going to turn off my camera and microphone, and get a glass of water. Is that okay with you? I'll be back in 3 minutes.

> If you're still not able to continue, after you pause...

Thanks for letting me take a break. You didn't do anything wrong, but I'm realizing that I'm not going to be able to continue this session. You will still be paid for the full time. I really appreciate you sharing with me today. Is it okay with you if we stop? Thanks very much.
