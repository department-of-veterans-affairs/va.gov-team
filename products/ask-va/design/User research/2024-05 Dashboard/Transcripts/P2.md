### Warm up

Tyler: Awesome. So I just wanna confirm again, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio today?

> P2: Yes. Yeah.

Tyler: Awesome.

Tyler: Okay. So I think we're ready to get started. Do you have any questions for me at this point?

> P2: No, no.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: So I just wanna learn a little bit about your experience with the VA and how you get in touch with us. First of all, I'm curious, how long have you been a Veteran?

> P2: Since 1999.

Tyler: Okay, and did you start interacting with the VA right after you got out of service, or just in the last couple of years?

> P2: Actually I was medically retired. So I transferred from DoD and my Branch Service Marine Corps, right to VA Medical service. So primarily, my interactions with the VA have only been through medical but I did do a home loan with them as well. So, taking advantage of the VA program for the home loans. But most of my stuff is medical, so.

Tyler: Okay, well, that sounds pretty common for Veterans. And have you contacted the VA a lot, maybe even just like your doctor?

> P2: I wouldn't say I contact a lot right now.

> P2: Based on my disability. Sometimes there was more, much more contact with the doctors and then but lately it's been less like I mean, I sometimes I had monthly contacts with the doctors usually through the app and through messaging using healthy vet portal, which is what I use majority of the of the time is the healthy vet portal and just messaging my doctors through there. But other than that, no, not a lot of contact with the VA.

> P2: In general, not even, I wouldn't say like right now, not even like once a month. So last year, probably once or twice a month, I was contacting them so.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense. So you mentioned using the app and then also using secure messaging and my healthy vet, that that makes sense. Have you ever heard of Ask Va?

> P2: I have heard of it, but I'm trying to recall if I used it, and I don't think I did.

Tyler: Okay, that's totally fine.

> P2: I had to submit a claim last year, and I don't think I used Ask VA to see it to find out where to send it. I think I was using the numbers on the notice of the letters I was getting back from the VA and using those phone numbers to call.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: That makes sense. And you might have seen it before. It sounds like, but maybe not, submitted something. So I'm just gonna quickly share my screen so you can see it and just remind you what it might look like. So I know you're on your phone, and this might look a little bit funny, but it should at least just give you a general idea of what we're talking about. So this is Ask VA. It's an online tool. And it's something that Veterans can use to ask a question. So you can ask questions about all different topics, like healthcare or housing assistance. For example.

Tyler: Today, we're gonna pretend, like you're kind of familiar with Ask VA, so let's say that you've used Ask VA to ask a couple of questions at this point. So you've filled out this form a couple of times in the past. Okay, do you have any questions about Ask VA at this point?

> P2: No, no.

Tyler: Okay. No worries. And you don't have to have like super in depth knowledge. But as long as we're kind of understanding, it's basically a contact form for the VA.

> P2: Okay.

Tyler: So now I'm gonna stop sharing my screen. We're gonna shift gears. And I'm actually gonna have you share your screen while you look at this prototype that I mentioned.

> P2: Okay.

Tyler: So we'll have to be a little bit patient, cause this can be a little tricky on the phone. But what I'm gonna do is send you a link in the chat on zoom, and it's gonna pop up right about now, and if you can click that link

> P2: Oh, there we go!

Tyler: You got it, and then let me know when that's open on your phone.

> P2: Okay, it is open.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So now that it's open, I'm gonna have you share your screen on zoom do you remember how to share your screen on your phone?

Tyler: I can help. Okay, no worries. So if you're back at zoom, where you can see my face, there should be. Yeah. I'll give you a second.

> P2: Oh, good! That's oh, yeah, to close that. I didn't see that close. Okay.

Tyler: Okay. So you're back on zoom.

> P2: Yeah.

Tyler: Okay. So there should be some controls depending on your phone. They might be at the bottom or the top, or sometimes in the middle, and we're looking for something that says share screen or start broadcasting.

> P2: No, I see a recording. I see...

Tyler: Okay.

> P2: And I've got 3 dots at the bottom, but I don't know.

Tyler: Let's see what those are.

> P2: One goes back to the Ask VA. You picture and picture there when I had that up.

Tyler: Okay. Hmm.

> P2: Trying to see, because oh, let me get back over on this speaker, that's just the keypad.

Tyler: What about up at the top? Is there any? Are there any controls up at the top.

> P2: Not that I see I just see recording, and then our pictures.

Tyler: Okay. Hmm.

> P2: Yeah, I'm trying to scroll left and right. There's the people that are in the chat.

Tyler: okay. Now, your photo has went away. So that might be because you're sharing your screen, or you're starting to... Or you just turning your camera on and off.

> P2: No, I'm scrolling left and right on my end.

Tyler: Okay.

> P2: So that if I scroll left it says your camera is muted. And if I scroll right, the other people that are on the call and muted.

Tyler: Right, right.

> P2: On none of those do I see. None of those. Do I see any tools?

Tyler: Yeah, that's okay. Like I said, this can be a little confusing, especially because everybody's phones a little different. Are you on iPhone or an Android?

> P2: iPhone.

Tyler: Well, usually on iPhone I think we should be able to see the controls from the zoom screen. But if we're not seeing them, that's totally okay.

Tyler: I'm going to share my screen on my side instead. Okay?

> P2: Okay.

Tyler: So you can stay on the zoom. And then I'm just gonna if you just give me a moment I'm gonna open it up on my side.

> P2: Yeah.

Tyler: Alright.

Tyler: So are you able to see my screen now?

> P2: Can you see mine? I don't know. That's not sharing it, but.

> P2: Tyler's screen. Okay, this is your screen. So.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So you're seeing my screen now.

> P2: Yeah.

Tyler: Okay, cool, so it should say Ask VA up at the top. Right?

> P2: Yeah. Yep. Awesome.

Tyler: Okay. So what we're gonna do is because this is open on my screen. I'm gonna ask you things like, where would you click? And I'm gonna click for you. Okay?

> P2: Okay.

Tyler: Alright. So we're seeing that we're on Ask VA. And we're gonna pretend like you're signed in. So it says Jordan up at the top. Let's pretend like that said [P2] and you're signed in to your account. Okay?

> P2: Okay.

Tyler: So 1st off. Can you describe this page to me? What are you noticing? And let me know if you want me to scroll.

> P2: Oh, there's now I see share screen. Now I've got stuff at the bottom.

Tyler: Okay, do, do we wanna try and do that? I can.

> P2: Yeah, we can. Oh, wait! I don't know where that went unless that was your menu is. Then it just went away.

Tyler: It wasn't my menu, but you might need to like tap on the middle of the screen, and then maybe those controls will show up again?

> P2: Let's see. You cannot start, screen, share while the other participant is sharing. Okay.

Tyler: I stopped now, so let's see if you can do it this time.

> P2: Screen share. Oh, I got you! I have to scroll real gently to get it to come up. What do I want to share.

Tyler: So we're gonna try and share that that window that you opened on your phone. That says Ask VA.

> P2: Start broadcast.

Tyler: Okay, that looks like it's showing up! No I'm seeing what you're seeing. But it's not Ask VA yet.

> P2: That's what I want to share. Is that what can you see?

Tyler: I can see it. And then it came back to Zoom. So if you just stay on the website...

> P2: There we go. Okay.

Tyler: Yeah. And then what you can do is my photos there, down at the bottom. You can just take your finger and put it on my photo and just swipe it to the right, and that'll get it out of the way.

> P2: There.

### Dashboard

Tyler: All right. So we're back on this page. And the question I asked was, can you describe this page to me? What are you noticing?

> P2: What I notice is other than ask a new question, there's no explanation about what you're doing on this website like. Get answers to your questions about VA benefits and services. Ask a new question, and that's it. It seems like there should be a little additional detail to that on Ask VA.

> P2: At least for me. That's how I see it. When I when I go to a new screen. And this says, ask answers to your questions about Va benefits.

> P2: Is there gonna be a prompt that asks me that tells me how long it's gonna take me to get an answer? Immediate, is it like a smart chat that there's somebody's monitoring this? You know, like the chats when you're troubleshooting something and like, you type the question. And then and somebody's there, and they start responding to you, or something like that. That's kind of what I notice.

Tyler: Right that makes sense.

Tyler: So there's not a lot of information about what this service does and maybe when you might choose to use it.

> P2: Right.

Tyler: Yeah, I can totally see that. And then I just noticed you might have tried to click on something. Can you tell me what you?

> P2: Oh, I was pulling down the menu to see there what was, if there was anything listed under the menu. And there's not.

Tyler: Okay, gotcha.

Tyler: Yeah. And like, I said, this is, since this is a prototype, some things we won't be able to click on. But let me know what you wanna click on as we go, and then I can help kinda guide you through it. It's really helpful to see what you are gravitating towards.

> P2: Yeah.

Tyler: Let's scroll down a little bit further.

> P2: I will tell you right now, I have a bachelor's. I have a master's, I've been employed for the Federal Government for [a long time]. So my experiences with websites and stuff like that might be different than, you know, like my father in law, who was a Vietnam Vet. Who, although he worked in technology, never really was a computer person. So like, I'm saying, like my familiarity as a Veteran might be a little bit different. So my experience, this probably might be a little bit different than some of the other Veterans would have so.

Tyler: Yeah, totally. I appreciate you calling that out. And that's super important to us. Because we know there's a lot of different Veterans and a lot of different age groups and familiarity with technology. So we'll speak to other Veterans this week who might have a totally different perspective, than you.

> P2: Right. Right. I just, I like to point out whatever I do into like a survey like, okay. So my familiarity with using phones and and the Internet and going through websites is a little bit different than others. So I'm just.

Tyler: Yeah, totally.

Tyler: okay. So we're scrolling down a little bit. And then we're noticing some like big boxes. What are these boxes?

> P2: I see sign in and technical issues. Provides a status and an update on it. And then the details. Then it has, oh, I guess there is the message there. How do I access secure messaging. So I guess this is a history of the other questions I've asked.

Tyler: Okay.

> P2: Oh, it does say your questions. Last updated. Was the oldest. And I love that. Oh, I can sort it by oldest and newest status.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P2: Looking at the status. Is that status reflective of the question or the issue? That's one question I would have, like.

Tyler: Tell me what do you mean by that.

> P2: So, like, if I'm asking the VA, where do I send a document, or what is the address, or, who's reviewing this appeal letter? Something that I've done is I've sent it an appeal before, and I've had to mail it in so like if I'm if I'm going into Ask VA, what is the address that I send my appeal to?

> P2: I'm looking at this, the status that says, solved. Does that mean that they've provided me an answer to the question I asked or that whatever I'm mailing to them has been solved.

Tyler: I totally get what you mean? Yeah, that's really interesting. So you might be asking them about a claim that you've submitted. And that's what your question is. But you're wondering is the status about my claim, or is it about this question I'm asking you about that?

> P2: Right. So if I clicked on, Solved and it shows up, does that mean they've made a decision on the claim? Or does that just mean that they've answered my question?

Tyler: Yeah, I can totally see why that's not clear. So we're understanding that there's a status and kind of what that might mean. But it might not be clear what status that's what's that.

> P2: Right. So status to a Veteran who's putting in claims is going to be different than status of my question.

Tyler: Totally. Yeah.

Tyler: I can totally see that distinction. And this is why I love doing research. So that makes sense to me, and we're noticing that like you, you said. These are questions that I've submitted in the past to the VA. You notice that there's an ability to kind of sort them by status.

> P2: Yeah.

Tyler: Status isn't clear yet. What would solved mean? Let's say this is the status of the question. What would solved mean?

> P2: So like. When I see, like healthcare, may 21st 2024, I'm 70% disabled, do my dependents get healthcare as well? Status solved.

#### Clicks into question details

> P2: I have no idea what that means, especially since, like the check details, right now, there's no information there. [Doesn't scroll down to conversation.] So I can see your message required, select files to upload conversation. Oh, I guess I didn't scroll down far enough in. I'm reading what it says in there.

> P2: So I guess so as soon as I send the question.

> P2: So for that one that does say solved because they do provide the answer.

> P2: But, again, if I'm asking for an address to mail something for like an appeal. And it says, Solved, does that mean that you gave me the address for that?

> P2: I was asking, because I can't find it. Cause that's ridiculously difficult to do on any VA website is to find addresses for for where you're supposed to mail copies of like I had a I had to pay for a prescription out of pocket, and I had to send like copies of the receipt, and I had to print out my claim form and mail it in, and then it got denied, and then I had to do an appeal on that, and I had to mail that in, and it went to a different address. And it's so. It's like I finally had to call people because I couldn't find those types of addresses.

> P2: And so the if I'm asking a question on here about, you know what's the address to submit this... Again, going back to that Solved, like, who's determining that it is solved is the other thing?

#### Returns to dashboard

> P2: So I'm trying to look at this other one. But that one's dead too. [Not linked in prototype].

Tyler: Yeah, we won't be able to click on everything. So let's stay on this page for a minute. You've touched on like a lot of things that I wanna make sure we capture. So we talked about like what does solved mean. And you were kind of like, I don't actually know what that means. I hope that that would mean that they give me the reply that I want but also like who determines if it's solved. Does VA determine that or do I determine? Is that what you're hinting at there?

> P2: Yeah. So like, if I'm asking a request, I'm requesting information. But what if it's the – and I'm trying to stay away from like, not the not the decision I want – But, as in, are you addressing the question I'm actually asking, or if I'm even if I'm asking it wrong. Would that be solved? Like if I asked the wrong question. Like if I'm asking for a benefit that I'm entitled to. But I've asked the question in an incorrect manner. With nobody, saying, Well, no, you're not entitled to that, but you are entitled to this like. Is there that kind of in depth response, or is it just, you know, pure database. Boolean string linked information that is looking for key words. And then it's providing the you know, the typical QA stuff. If you're a veteran claiming this, then no, this is the answer.

Tyler: Okay, yeah. So almost making a distinction between generic information?

> P2: Yeah. Is there customer service behind the answer? Or is it just the VA, like, no, you don't qualify for that, and that's the end of it. They say it's solved was like, well, I still have my issue. What else? What other things are available. What other resources are available to me?

> P2: So like for my prescription thing that I was talking about. They were like, well, did you go through, whatever pairing the community, and well, the problem was is that it happened over a weekend and on a holiday weekend that I was trying to get medication, and the offices were closed, and care of the community is closed, but it like I had to go in and dig all of that up so like, you know? Like if I'm asking for care in the community, am I doing that right, or am I supposed to just go and make a claim. So you know. That's kind of what I'm looking at. 

> P2: Is there like a customer service feel to it, or, is it just strictly, "No, you're not entitled to this," Or, "No, we can't provide that service."

Tyler: I totally get what you're saying. It's reminding me a little bit of like this distinction between I googled this thing and Google doesn't know to say to me, like, sorry you should have actually Googled this, and then.

> P2: Right.

Tyler. Oh, I think you got a little quieter there.

> P2: Oh, I'm sorry I turned away for a second, I said.

> P2: It's just like, is it by key terms, like linking a key term to a result.

Tyler: Okay. And are you also talking a little bit about like, yes. I submitted this inquiry, and you might feel that the inquiry was solved. But my situation is not progressing forward, or you haven't helped me forward with that.

> P2: Right. And that's, I mean, for me as a Veteran, that's really what the issue is. For Veterans going to a site like this is, they're trying to address an issue that's affecting them, either physically, mentally, financially, personally, there's, you know, it's personal for every Veteran, why they're asking these questions.

> P2: And if you're just saying like, there, if it's based on that question, that doesn't help it. That doesn't like it doesn't seem like you're putting any care into this or trying to help a Veteran get the benefits that they deserve. You're just straight up, just like, no, not that.

> P2: That issue would still exist for that veteran. So the purpose of the VA is to help the Veterans, not just like, who gets what benefits and exclude others. It's to help the Veterans when they need help. They're contacting the VA, when they're contacting VA, they have an issue they would need information on because they're trying to resolve something so.

Tyler: That that makes a lot of sense. I totally see where you're coming from.

Tyler: Zooming back out a little bit again... We're on this page. Is it obvious to you which of these questions might have a reply from the VA yet?

> P2: Well, yeah, there was the check marks that say Solved. That would show that they have an answer. But again, what is solved? 

Tyler: You got a little quiet again there. But I think you said, that's okay, you said solved would show that they have an answer?

> P2: Yeah, they have an answer. Then the new one is starred.

Tyler: Okay, got it that that makes sense. Is there anything else you want to tell me that you're noticing about these boxes? We talked about the question. We talked about the status.

> P2: Last update.

> P2: Let me see which one had an issue. I think I don't know which one has information in the check details. Besides, the. [Trying to find which one you can click into in the prototype.]

#### Clicks into question details

> P2: So it does say, send a reply. So they've provided their answer at the bottom, and I can send a reply. But does that change the update? Or is the update when I get something back from the VA?

> P2: So like under the check details for the 70% disabled. Here's my question. And then the 1st thing that pops up is, send a reply your message required, and then I have like uploads and stuff like that, and I can click, send, and then it shows me the rest of the conversation.

> P2: But is that last updated going to reflect me presenting another question or sending additional materials? Or is the update only when the VA responds?

Tyler: I see. Okay.

> P2: I might forget. I might be, you know, like kids at home. So I've got tons of things going on, and I meant to sit down and do this, and then my kid called me away. Did I click, send or not? And I look at last update, and it just says, oh, no, this tells me when the VA responds, it doesn't tell me if I provided additional detail additional information, or I asked a follow up question.

Tyler: Right. So you're wondering if last update, let's say, we put something in today on June 3rd would it change to June 3rd?

> P2: Right, yeah.

> P2: Yeah, does that status? Well, you mean, yeah. Cause if I ask a follow up question that it's no longer solved because I've asked an additional question. So would the status change with the update change to show that they've received it? Or you know, it's being processed.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P2: None of these say submitted. Like, in this example, none of them say like submitted, that we're awaiting an answer or. You know, typical VA, speak. When I send something into them, I get a letter back that says, yeah, you submitted this request on whatever day it's under review.

Tyler: Right. Yeah, yeah. What day do you think these were submitted? It doesn't say?

> P2: Right.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: Okay, well, let's see.

> P2: Is it 'in progress' that one there? So, but again, in that dropdown, when I submit additional information on one of these questions, does that change, and will the status change to in progress, or will a new box open up for me?

Tyler: Right.

Tyler: Let's look at this October one for a second.

Tyler: So what's October 13th like what happened on that day?

> P2: October 13? I see 19th. Which one are you looking at? ... Oh, there it is. I see. October 13th Okay. I was looking at the last update. Okay.

Tyler: So that's helpful. Because it seemed like, that's where your eyes have been drawn is like the status, and the last update.

> P2: Yeah. As a Veteran, that's what I'm looking for. It's not the date of submission I'm looking at, it's when it was last updated.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense. So you're kind of like you're more concerned with like, when was the last thing that happened on this?

> P2: Right. Yeah, not when I originally submitted it. I wanna know, like, when was the last time the VA provided an answer or an update, or, you know, say it told me it's still under consideration, so that I know from my request, you know that it's still being worked on, or that got a answer, or something like that. So.

Tyler: This is kind of a different question. But just making me think about this. So, what about like, if you had just signed in. You're looking at these questions because you remembered that at some point you asked the VA about home loans, and you wanted to reread their response... How would you find that? Would you just scroll and look for it? What would you be doing to find that question?

> P2: Well, just cause I clicked on the other one the check details. Course it's dead on that one. It looks like.

Tyler: So even before that point like, how would you find that question? That box, out of these 3 boxes?

> P2: Check details, logically speaking, is where I would find additional information on the question I asked.

> P2: I kind of get on websites, and I poke around and I look for stuff. So I don't have a problem. I don't get frustrated like if I can't find in and have to drill down to get through different layers. It's just how I do have to do like a lot of my research for my work. So I'm kind of used to that.

Tyler: That makes sense.

> P2: As a Veteran, just trying to think without my background or history, there's nothing like check details doesn't provide... 

> P2: Maybe if it said check details and responses or check details and replies, or you know what I'm saying, like something that says, hey, this is where you get information. Check details could be just the detail on when I submitted it. And it could just be like, here's my question. It was submitted October 19th, it was received on this date, and then that's it, you know.

> P2: So I don't know if there's sufficient information under just check details like. Some other type of terminology could be used to clarify that this is what I need to look for.

Tyler: Yeah. That makes sense.

### Question details

Tyler: Why don't we go ahead... I see the time we've got about 15 min left. So why don't we go ahead and click check details on the May 21st question. That one that we've looked at a few times.

> P2: Yeah.

Tyler: And you've told me a little bit about this page like, right when we got here you were looking straight for that reply from the VA.

Tyler: You showed me that you could send a reply to the VA. Anything else you want to point out to me on this page?

> P2: I would prefer, before I send a reply, to see the information above it. So just the way I like, how I read from like, okay, here, this is my question. So here's their response. Now I want to send a reply to that and drag folders and files, and then. There's the message that you have to type in and then hit send.

> P2: Just the order that I would rather see, like my original question shown under there since this is the details. Here's your my original question. Boom! There's the details, their response. Then, if I need to send a reply.

Tyler: Yeah, I think that logically makes a lot of sense. And you actually kinda took us one step further. So if we scroll up to send reply, now, it's gonna look like you've written a reply in. So let's pretend like we did that. Let's pretend, like you wrote in. And we're going to send this reply to the VA. Can you show me how you would do that?

> P2: Oh, I'd hit the send button right there. So just click on the send button, and there it goes.

Tyler: Okay and then. Now, what are we seeing? Is this kind of what you expected, or anything different?

> P2: No, that's kind of what I'd expected. Your response is submitted successfully. You should receive a reply, you know, typical VA language you should receive... What it doesn't say is, if you don't hear from us by X amount of days. I don't know how much information you're giving to the VA, but should receive a reply within 7 business days. What if I haven't heard in 7 business day? How many days should I wait before I do a follow up before I call? Who's gonna contact me? Are they just going to call me? Are they just going to respond to this? Am I gonna get a letter in the mail?

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: Yeah, so like a little bit more information about what to expect next. And if you don't hear back from them, are you wondering about that. I hear that from Veterans a fair amount like, what if I don't hear back? What should I do, or why are you wondering about that? Is that an experience you've had before?

> P2: Oh, yeah, it's an experience every Veteran has that that I've ever talked to. I've submitted something, and they said I should hear, get a response by this time. What do I do? And I always tell them, well, if I don't get it 7 days, and I give them a couple of extra work days. Then I start calling on it. You don't know how it's being received and processed on the VA side so. I don't know if it's been assigned to a caseworker. I don't know if it's gone to, you know some somebody else for review.

> P2: If there's you know what information is, additional information is being gathered. Yeah, all that kind of stuff. So.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

Tyler: What would you do next? Like you've just submitted this response, you can tell it's submitted successfully. What would you do next?

> P2: Me personally, if I'm doing this, once the responses been sent, I would either close out the window because I'm only dealing with that issue or go to menu if there's something else I need to look up. Or some other like I need to check on my a prescription or something like that, or a travel claim, or something like that. It would go to the menu. If I didn't see it under the menu, then I'd click on my dropdown, and then if that if that was I didn't find what I was looking for, I'll start looking at the what's down there at the bottom.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. So if you had another task, you might continue on va.gov, but otherwise you'd probably close out.

> P2: Yeah. Otherwise, I close out the window. Yeah.

Tyler: Yeah. How would you get back to that Ask VA homepage that we started at?

> P2: I would assume I would just go to what is it ask.va.gov, and you have to sign in.

> P2: But for me personally, I cheat, and I go through a healthy vet, and then I click on a link and get back that way, so that I'm already logged in. So then straight through. So I I kind of use healthy vet as my access portal. Really, most of the stuff I'm asking is medical related. So it's either appointments medications, statuses. Or if I have a claim in. And I need to see the status, I go through healthy vet. And then when I click on the sending like veterans, programs and resources or Va resources that I can get redirected to claims and stuff like that. Then I don't have to sign in again. So.

Tyler: Yeah, everyone has their sign in loopholes, don't they? Let's scroll up a little bit. And I, seeing a link here that says, return to Ask VA, what does that mean?

> P2: I think it would take me back to the screen that it was on before just listing the questions I have asked.

Tyler: Yeah, okay, cool. Well, let's go ahead and click on that, and we'll see where we go.

Tyler: And taking a look, this is kind of what you were describing to me just now, right?

> P2: Yeah.

Tyler: Yeah, and let's just have a look. Has anything on this page changed since you sent your reply?

> P2: Oh, yeah, yeah, I see the in progress now. I don't know that update date or if the update changed. I wasn't paying that close attention on what the time and date was on the follow up question. But it said it was submitted successfully, and then the status change. But I don't know that the [last] update [date] changed.

Tyler: Okay, Gotcha, so you can't quite remember the time or whatever. But you're like, I can tell that it's now says in progress.

> P2: Right.

Tyler: Has anything else changed?

> P2: Oh, yeah, I guess that one went to the top. So. That's one was above that. So.

> P2: But I'm just curious about new versus in progress. So if it's a new request that I send in, it should be in progress, or it should be solved. I don't know why there's a new status.

Tyler: So the new is, is kind of confusing, because it feels like it should either be in progress or solved? The in progress seems to kind of make sense right? And then we've got solved, which we've also found a little bit confusing. And then it looks like there's something else here when you open up that menu, it says, reopened. What does that mean?

> P2: Oh, yeah, that's what I don't know. Like reopened, to me, like reopen was has more of a connotation of a benefits, decision. We're reopening your case because additional information has been submitted. Reopening a question doesn't make a lot of sense, because it's either in progress or solved. Again, new doesn't make a lot of sense, either. So it's either in progress or solve. Why would I need to reopen it if it's been solved like? Because I can go to that one? And as we saw, you can submit additional information on it which you, in progress, or do these messages delete after a certain amount of time like, is it? Are they being archived, and I have to reopen it for some reason?

> P2: But there's no information there that says, messages are kept for X amount of time. You know, records with the records keeping with the government. There's, you have an amount of time. You have to keep records, especially for like medical records.

> P2: But why would it be reopened? What's that status? And so, if it's in progress or solved, and again, the new one throws me off because it's like, okay, this is a new question. That does that mean nobody's taking any action on it? It's not in progress. Like it went down a black hole at the VA. And nobody's responding to me. That's what I don't like about that status, because it sets the VA up as like we're not working on this.

> P2: Like, well, wait a second. I asked that a month ago, and it hasn't changed from new to anything so.

Tyler: Right. Let me ask you a couple of kind of like quick, quick, round questions about the statuses. So if new was only a status for a couple of hours or a day. How would that feel?

> P2: Well again, I'm just trying to think logically from from my perspective, if I submitted it, and it told me congratulations. It's been successfully submitted.

> P2: When I submit that question like we did it with the disability rating question, it changed to in progress, like immediately. So why would it be a new status? As a veteran would make me feel like I didn't do something right.

> P2: I get that message that said it's been successfully submitted. Then why would it show up as new versus in progress?

Tyler: Yeah, that comparison is really helpful, like you sent the reply and it went right to in progress. So why wouldn't it do that every time you submit your question.

> P2: Right.

Tyler: For in progress. Let's talk about that for a second. So in this scenario we submitted a question, the VA replied, but we had a follow-up question, and then we replied to the VA. What status would make sense for that whole journey? And does it change?

> P2: The in progress is in keeping with the the VA's process, like, we've received a request and it's under, I said, like I'll get letters if I send in something for all my medical request. I'll get a letter, like, we have received it, we're gathering information. If you look up a claim, you can look at your claim status and you can see like we're gathering information. No decisions been made yet. So in progress is, I think, language that Veterans would understand and be like, okay. If they've received it. They just haven't made a decision yet, or they haven't provided me the answer yet. Somebody's looking into it.

> P2: That's what throws me off with the the new.

Tyler: Yeah, I totally get that. And we've already kind of talked about this. But just to kind of help us tie everything together. At what point should it be solved?

> P2: I have no idea. I would think 7 days would be sufficient time to get a response back, at least. So that's what I would say 7 days.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. My question wasn't phrased super well. So at what point do you think the status should change to solved?

> P2: Once the once a response is sent.

> P2: I think that from in progress to solve it would be the time, however long, when the VA responds, it would change to solved and then again, if I've had a follow-up question... But at that point, like how many back and forth do we have to have before you understand that the issue isn't being solved. Obviously, if you send me an answer and I send a follow up, and then you send me an answer, and I send you another follow up. There's a breakdown in communication. Either I'm asking the wrong question or I'm not asking it in the correct manner. There's a communication breakdown there that if we're having to go back and forth several times between in progress solved in progress. So so we're not actually solving the problem. We're still like gathering data.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. So you can kind of see why it might ping pong between those. But if that's happening, then clearly it hasn't been solved.

> P2: Right.

### Cool down

Tyler: Yeah, I get that. We've got about 3 min left. So what we can do is you can stop sharing your screen. There should be, it depends kind of on your screen. But maybe clicking on that red dot.

> P2: Yeah, I think it says, stop screen broadcasting stop. So that should.

Tyler: Okay, cool.

Tyler: Awesome. So now you hopefully should see be able to see me again. So that was really really helpful for me. There was a lot we covered in there, and I think at the end we kind of got a chance to summarize some of it. But overall, what did you like about that process? And what would you change.

> P2: Yeah, I think there needs to be a little bit of clarity in the messaging on the first, to start off on the welcome screen on. You know, that this isn't a chat. You're not getting an immediate response. This is, you're submitting a question online just be aware that you're not in a chat function with a live person. We'll receive your question and provide you an answer, as you know, as soon as possible.

> P2: Other than that, besides the labeling of questions. I think it's it seemed pretty user friendly, though, like it's pretty straightforward about what a user needs to do to submit a question and how to add additional details, and to send replies. So.

Tyler: Yeah, I think to that point, like, you could figure out where to click around and you could send your reply and things like that. But I definitely noticed some things that could be shifted around or like you said maybe better described.

Tyler: I'm curious, overall, do you feel like this is a if like thing that you would use to contact the VA?

> P2: Maybe in the future. Right now I don't, because majority of what I'm looking into is for for medical so I'm using the healthy vet and, you know, sending a question to my doctor to a general practice. Or, you know, prescriptions to the pharmacy and stuff like that.

Tyler: Yeah, so you want, like, that direct contact with yours.

> P2: Yeah. So I have the direct contact versus sending it to VA at large as an organization, as a bureaucracy of the Federal Government. At least with my healthe vet, I'm sending it to my provider. So it's somebody familiar with my case, somebody who knows me, and all of the all of that type of stuff

> P2: I never had to go from Veteran to Medical care through submitting a claim. I was transferred over because I was being medically retired. So I had a VA rating before I even left active duty. So I was already in the system. So my experience is a little bit different. I've always had a more personal experience in my interactions with the VA then, somebody who just got out like, Oh, jeez, I need to get, you know, and I'm having some issues. I'm wondering if this is something that's service related. Where do I start? So my perspective was a little skewed just because I had that history of being directly in the system.

Tyler: Yeah, no, I think that's a really good point. And I think that probably, that transition happening more easily for you is a different perspective than other Veterans.

> P2: Yeah, oh, yeah, definitely.

Tyler: Yeah, so that that that's really helpful context. We've reached our end of the hour. So I don't want to keep you for too long. At this point, do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?

> P2: No, no.

Tyler: Okay, awesome. Well, thank you so much for your time. You're gonna receive a thank you note with some information. That you can pass on to other veterans if they want to do this in the future. And if you have any questions you can reach out to the folks who set up this session from Perigean.

> P2: Alright!

Tyler: And I hope you have a lovely rest of your day. 

> P2: Alright! Thanks you too.

Tyler: Thanks, bye.
