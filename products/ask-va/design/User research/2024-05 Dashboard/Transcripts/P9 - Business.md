### Warm up

Tyler: Okay, now that the recording has started, I just want to confirm one more time. Are you okay with me recording my screen and audio as we talk today?

> P9: Yes, that's fine.

Tyler: Awesome. Do you have any questions for me at this point?

> P9: No, I'm good to go... Do you want me to introduce myself now?

Tyler: Yeah, that's be great. Let's start there.

> P9: I'm [P9]. I'm at [University], I'm finishing up my 38th year as a school certifying official. So I've been at [University] for 38 years. I've been in various roles but I've always done by VA.

> P9: I have two certifying officials that report to me, so there's 3 of us total that are school certifying officials that use Ask a question in our office. I had a wide width of different experiences. One has 4 years and one has 3 months of experience. I get all ends up of the input of different expressions and questions.

> P9: We have around 800 students annually using VA benefits at [University].

> P9: Tell me what you want to know otherwise.

Note: P9 continued to refer to school certifying officials by their full name, rather than the acronym. So I (Tyler) used the full name as well. However, in the transcript I'll replace with the acronym for brevity.

Tyler: Awesome. That was really helpful. It sounds like you've had a lot of experience as a SCO, and obviously over the years, you probably used a lot of systems as things changed. That's helpful context for me.

Tyler: How are you using Ask VA in your role?

> P9: We're using Ask VA to submit things for... if we have documents we need to submit to VA. If something comes up on a file, if we have a question about something we may use Ask VA for that. We're using Ask VA for inquiries if we have to develop...

> P9: Sometimes, we'll try to use the school hotline first, to resolve like, I have my 2 certification specialists verify payments to the VA. When they show up and they don't match, then my rule is they have to call and ask why don't they match. And sometimes that may lead to us having to submit an Ask a question, if it's a complex kind of a deal.

> P9: Sometimes we don't, sometimes we do.

> P9: We may have students just walk in and have issues arise, where we have to do an Ask a question.

> P9: We also use it for our work studies, obviously, so we use it for contract initiation, contract termination, zero contract initiation and timesheet submissions.

> P9: I have a receptionist that we share between financial aid, a full time person, both financial aid and VA, serves in an administration reception kind of duty function. I made her a read-only SCO and a work study supervisor so she can be able to submit paperwork and ask questions and everybody will say okay she's on the approved list. To be able to access information. I'm trying to train her how to do some of the work study submissions, if it's a simple time card, then that way she can sign off on it. Because I have her verifying their work schedules, and she's up there more of the time than I am, so she's able to keep a better eye on them supervision wise, that they're working their hours. 

> P9: It's a team effort, it just depends on what's going on. We use it for a variety of methods.

Tyler: That's awesome. That was so much information. I'm definitely going to have to go back and read our notes.

Tyler: There's so much I want to ask about. One thing that comes to mind is it sounds like sometimes you're operating in a school certifying official capacity and sometimes in a work study site supervisor capacity. Is that right?

> P9: Exactly, exactly.

> P9: They have their benefits, so when they use VA work study. They have to be a ¾ time student because work study is a part of their benefits, so they have to qualify for work study. But, we have to have them certified. I have to my SCO on the side, and pay attention to that, that they're certified for enough hours. And if we got them certified for that upcoming term, or else VA won't be able to process their contract for them to be able to work in our office. 

> P9: Work study's are critical to our office, helping us get all those tasks done that come up when you have school of our size. We have to deal with a lot of things. Something happens and either we make an error or we have to resubmit, we have to fix it. We try to fix those problems before we submit so things don't delay their contracts getting issued or making sure documents are signed properly.

> P9: So it's really hat A and hat B, the work study is kind of it's own little animal. You have to track the hours they're working, make sure they're not going over the contract hours. Every 2 weeks, we're submitting a timesheet so they can get paid.

> P9: We're also submitting ahead of time, I just got through doing the spring contract, while we had the spring contract going, we still were sending in timesheets but also, towards the end of the term we're sending in paperwork for a zero hour contract to be initiated so that way they can work during the break period, because our offices are open at the break. At the time, I only had 2 work study's and they both had hours from their spring contract that they needed to use up, they hadn't had time to use. So they're able to use some of those unworked hours for the sprint semester during the break.

> P9: At the same time, though, soon as I got that zero hour contract. Then, we're turning around a requesting for the summer contract. And we'll go through the same thing here very soon, because, we'll turnaround and do it for the summer and the fall.

Tyler: Interesting. It sounds like, you mentioned about every 2 weeks you submit a timesheet, and you had about 2 work study students?

> P9: Two to three. We just hired a third one. So we're going to be up to 3 submissions every 2 weeks for those students.

Tyler: Got it, okay, so 3 submissions every 2 weeks from those 3 students.

Tyler: And on top of that, you said sometimes it's a complex question you submit, more as a SCO. How many inquiries do you think you're submitting every month?

> P9: Right now, I've got two certification specialists, so I've got it divided between the two of them. They're doing Ask a question, probably a couple of times a week. Between the two of them. Depends on what part of the semester we're in ... sometimes it's heavier, sometimes it's lighter.

> P9: When we're getting payments in, we might be doing Ask a question because of a payment development showed up and it was weird. And we had to do things. So we'll probably do more during that period.

> P9: For beginning of term, sometimes...

> P9: And you never know when they're going to walk in the door. We do try and get them to submit Ask a question for their own circumstances. They can do their own. But sometimes they give us a document and then the toll free has told us to submit the document, or, they just want us to submit the document. They may not have a scanner at home. They may not be a techy kind of person. [University] is still very much into personalized care, if they come to see us and they don't know, they're not comfortable with technology, they don't have scanners at home.


> P9: I did Ask a question... People know us in the community too, we'll help them if they ask us to. I had one a couple weeks ago, I've been trying to help her with her disability, so I did submit, not an Ask a question, but I had to fax something to the [State] Department of Veterans Affairs so she could get her disability paperwork started. So it just kind of depends on what the students' needs are. But some of them don't have that capability, some of the younger students, they're more techy, they're fine with it. But our older Veterans, sometimes they're less techy, so we kind of step in and help them a bit more.

Tyler: Right, yeah, I didn't even really thought about that idea of like you're interfacing with students all the time obviously and sometimes you're letting them know that they can submit increase for themselves or sometimes obviously a lot of your role, you're submitting on behalf of them.

> P9: Yeah.

Tyler: I have like 4,000 more questions, but I think I think they're gonna come up as we, as we talk through some of the things we're gonna show you also.

> P9: Okay. Okay.

Tyler: So why don't we shift gears. I also want to just quickly confirm, are you a veteran yourself?

> P9: No.

Tyler: Okay. So I'm gonna shift gears and I'm gonna actually send something for you to look at.

> P9: Okay.

Tyler: And, so I'm gonna send that in, you're on your computer, right?

> P9: Yes. I'm in my computer.

Tyler: Okay. And when y'all are submitting inquiries to ask a question, are you usually on a computer or not a phone?

> P9: We're on our computers normally, but from there, then we'll use our phones to do the confirmation through the ID.me to sign in to the question if that makes sense.

Tyler: That does. Yeah, that makes sense.

> P9: For me personally, I'm only on my computer now.

> P9: I mean, you know, I've seen some of them use it, you know, with their phones, you know, so I'm probably, I don't have a fancy phone, so I probably would be a little afraid of that.

> P9: And I'd be, you know, and plus we try not to, we're generally going to be on our computers for the simple reason, it's student information, so there's confidentiality involved, so we're going to be on our computer.

Tyler: Right, that makes sense.

> P9: And we're just gonna use our phones for verifying the information because we're not supposed to have student information on our phones. Unless there... I could understand where some institutions sometimes issues phones to their, you know, staff. [Our University's] not that, you know, we don't have that kind of money. So, you know, that's not happening.

> P9: So, you know, we're on our computers because if we're submitting something, it's got student information on it. We have to be on our computers because we can't put their personal information on our phones if that makes sense.

Tyler: Yeah, that totally makes sense. That was I was assuming you were just naturally on your computer, but that makes sense also that you should keep student information on your computer.

> P9: Yeah.

Tyler: So I'm gonna send this link, in the Zoom chat. So, Yeah, so.

> P9: Okay. Oh, okay. Which way you were sending? I was like, get my email going, okay, should be, no, you're fine.

Tyler: I can send it to your email too if that's easier. Okay.

> P9: Whichever way I see the chat, so I'll open up the chat.

Tyler: Okay. Okay, and then once you got that opened on your side, it might take a minute to load, so just let me know when it's loaded.

> P9: Okay, I'm opening the link right now.

> P9: And if you need to share my screen, I'm fine with that.

Tyler: Yeah, that's what we're gonna do next. So that would be perfect.

> P9: Just tell me what you want me to do. Okay, it's open.

Tyler: Okay, it's open. Alright, so then we'll come back to zoom and then have you shared your screen recently on zoom?

> P9: No, I haven't done that with Zoom, so just tell me what, and I'll try to, I'll try to be not too un-techie with you. I'm not the best techie either.

Tyler: Oh no, I don't mind at all. That's okay. So now that you're back at Zoom where you can see my face, there's some icons at the bottom of your Zoom window and there should be one in the middle that's green.

> P9: Yes. Okay.

Tyler: It says share screen. So if you click on that. Then it's gonna ask you to slick on a window. So you're gonna find that one we just opened.

> P9: Do you want the one with your picture or do you want the the Ask VA picture.

Tyler: Ask VA picture is perfect.

> P9: Ask VA picture is perfect. Okay.

> P9: Alright, can you see it? Is that okay? Okay.

Tyler: Yes, that's perfect. Yeah, that's perfect. So now I can see, Ask VA. And basically, we're what we're gonna do now is we're gonna pretend like you're signed in.

> P9: Okay.

### Dashboard

Tyler: I know this is gonna look a little different to what you're used to on Ask VA. And part of that is because what we're working on right now is moving Ask VA to VA.gov. So it's not a separate website. And so that's why it looks a little bit different and that's also why we're chatting with you.

> P9: Gotcha.

Tyler: And so what we're gonna do is we're gonna pretend like we're signed into your account. So you went through ID. Dot me you signed in and now here you are and the 1st thing I want us to do, we're not gonna click on anything, but you're welcome to scroll around and I want you to just start telling me what that you're noticing.

> P9: It looks like my normal. I mean, because I mean, I see the business one, which is the one I normally use to submit under.

> P9: I think I accidentally did personal once upon a time the 1st time in years ago, but, usually I submit under business.

> P9: Then from there, you know. Ask a new question is readily easily available. So that's my instinct would be to go there and click on whoever... you know get on the business one and then initiate a new question would be my instinct.

Tyler: Awesome. Yeah...

> P9: And I see the boxes down below. So, you know, that shows the I'm assuming the previous things that were submitted recently.

Tyler: Yeah, perfect. So 1st off you notice like the business tab, which is what you usually use. And then you talked about the link to ask a new question, which seems pretty easy for you to find and you knew that like that's usually where you'd end up going. And then we've got some questions here. And like you said, we're imagining that you asked these questions in the past.

Tyler: Let's take a look at some of the questions. So, you know, you can choose one of these boxes and tell me what the information is in this box.

> P9: Let's see, time card attached so that be a work study submission the 1st one on the May 17th at 24 submission. Looks like.

> P9: New, let's see, check details. So if I check details, [tries to click check details]. You know, that would show me what the whether it was depending on whether it been answered and completed or not, whether it been answered and completed or not, you know, what the answer was, because that's how it works right now.

Tyler: Yeah. Yeah.

> P9: So that would be my assumption. On that part. So, you know, so it looks like several time cards, you know, the two on the 17th both look like time card submissions. One for Scott, one for green. The 14th let's see. Application so I guess that's a VA work study application. For the 14th and then it's still being processed. As of May 14th it was still being processed showing the status of it.

> P9: And then the May 8th one is showing it solved that was a contract so I'm assuming the contracts been issued on VA work study.

Tyler: Okay, awesome. So that was really helpful. So you're noticing like the type of submission that these are just based on your experience like you know what a time card submission would be, it would be for work study. And, and you talked about how like for the May 14th one, it's still in progress.

Tyler: And then this one on May 8th looks like they've solved it. That probably means the contracts been issued.

> P9: Yes.

Tyler: Right. Awesome. What is the status where it says new? What does that mean?

> P9: Okay. I'm gonna say, new is still pending in progress. If it's new, I'm, I'm assuming it was just submitted. Hasn't been worked yet.

Tyler: Okay. And do you know if there's like, what's the difference between new and in progress or is that unclear?

> P9: That was what I would... that did run through my mind. I was like, okay. There's new one and there's in progress. I'm assuming the in progress they've actually pulled it in our starting to work it. Or in that the new ones were just submitted.

> P9: Cause I know sometimes it takes time. I well, I know on ask a question. This is I know ask a question shows up almost immediately for you all so I know it doesn't take that long to show up on your screens for people to be able to work it so I'm not sure not sure I can answer on how much all thought processes between new and in progress but my guess would be in progress means that they're currently working it.

Tyler: Right, okay, that makes sense. So it's not really clear why it says new because it probably is just the same as in progress.

> P9: Yeah.

> P9: Yeah, that kinda is equating into the same thing in, in my book. I mean, you know, it may be a new, submission, but it's, I'm assuming it's going to change in progress at some point. And there's a reason why it's, showing you before it shows in progress. So assuming that it has to be, I know that they have to download it into the work steady system? So I do know that.

> P9: So I know sometimes I'll call on the work study line and they say, oh, let me go in to ask, you mean that because we have to give them that ask a question reference number, which I don't, which I assume there's some kind of reference number here.

> P9: Where is that [reference number] gone? And are they going to be able to look it up by name and date of submission?

> P9: Because right now we have to give them that a number and if we don't have that or they can't find it to be able to look it up if we call them and we need them to expedite a work steady contract for us.

Tyler: Right. Okay.

> P9: That is one thing I am noticing is that, you know, how, how do we?

> P9: I'm assuming it was on the original submission. If this is the original submission thing, where did we get the reference number?

Tyler: Yeah.

> P9: If we have to call them and ask them for something special or call and tell them, you know, they say submit it like I have processors who come to the school.

> P9: Twice a year a federal processor [comes to the school] so sometimes when they're here on campus we'll get documents out of our files. And we'll scan it and then we'll upload it to ask a question and then we'll give them the reference number and then the processor can download it and then they work it on site while they're here for our that come in.

> P9: It's a special event that we do. In the beginning of the fall and at beginning of the spring semester, Muskogee supported us in that effort and it helps us resolve pay problems and we really like that.

> P9: So that ask a question's been an invaluable tool for us to be able to do immediate submission in the processor who's sitting in my conference room, you know, down the hallway is able to download it.

> P9: I just give her the reference number and then she can go download it. So I guess that's my only question on there.

Tyler: Yeah. That's really helpful feedback. That's exactly why we're talking to you. So we don't have the reference number showing right here. And I guess our thought was like, do people actually use the reference number? And it sounds like it definitely in your capacity.

> P9: We do.

Tyler: Yeah, as a business user, it's important. So that makes sense. And...

> P9: And we screenshot that. I'll just tell you right now, when we submit I make my staff screenshot that reference number because, I know that I should get it in an email but there's no way when it's emailed to us to show what it was in reference to. So a lot of time it's hard when you get that reference number because there's no name associated.

> P9: And I get the, thing on names. And privacy information, but you know what we do end up having to do is we screenshot it when we're doing the submission, we'll do a screenshot of that A number that we submitted it and then we put it with that file so we know what the number is in association to what file that we're submitting when I've got the SEO hat on or whether we got work study.

> P9: Because if we don't have that A number then we can't. We don't have that reference number. There's no way for anybody else to be able to look it up for us when we call in if there's something we have to follow up on.

> P9: Or we're trying to check the status of it, you know, and see, I see how much longer it's gonna be before they work it.

Tyler: Right, okay, that makes a lot of sense. I can see why you need it and then when you're saying, you know, we need it to be associated with that file and in the email it won't have like any information about that.

Tyler: That's super interesting. And I just want to clarify, are you talking, when you say that file, you're talking about a specific students file, right?

> P9: Yes, yes, there's no way for us to, you know, there's no all we get is that we submitted something to ask a question with an A number.

Tyler: Yeah, right.

> P9: It shows up in the email now and it should show up, you know. I'm paranoid, so I make them screenshot it before they submit it because if life happens, then there's no way for us to tell that.

Tyler: Right, totally. That makes sense. So one is like a bit of like we definitely need this reference number.

Tyler: Let's screenshot it, but the other thing if, if we get that email, assuming we do, we won't be able to associate it with, you know, Calum Scott or Shayna Green. So that becomes a bit tricky, totally. That makes a lot of sense. So all very interesting things so far.

> P9: Mhmm.

Tyler: And if we're looking at this screen right now, it kind of sounds like the way that you're thinking about like the way that you find inquiries is using the reference number and then maybe the student's name is that right?

> P9: Yeah, generally, generally, I mean, you know, the students names never on, you know, what, like I said, I mean, and we get it before we submit, then we've at least got, you know, we got it, we've got...

> P9: Now I'm bad. We're still on paper file, so we haven't gone to the electronic files yet. So we'll have to drop it into electronic file, you know, eventually, but at this point we're still on good old fashioned paper...

> P9: So we'll sit there and I'll take a word document. Let's open it and paste and drop it in, drop that A number in there and print it out.

> P9: So I know I can attach to that file. We know that that's what it's in reference to or like I said, if I've got a processor, I'll just bring it out.

> P9: The reference number so and say here's the number that you know associated with it or when I call the Muskogee here's the reference number because that's what I have to give them if I can't give them that reference number.

> P9: They can't search it because Muskogee, when I call them, you know, if I call them and say I didn't ask a question, Muskogee tells me they can't find it, you know, unless I can give them the reference number.

> P9: You know, it's, it's traditionally been, just giving in the students name isn't gonna, they, if it hasn't been downloaded yet, there's no way for them to be able to down to search it through the students name on their system.

> P9: So if it hasn't been downloaded yet into their system. The only way for them to access it is to be able to give them the reference number.

Tyler: Right, totally. That makes a lot of sense. You mentioned something while you were talking about that, which was like, you will create a Word document, you'll put the reference number in and then I'm assuming you print that out to put in the students file.

> P9: Yes. Yes.

Tyler: What information would you put on that that printout that you're gonna create? Like it's obviously the reference number, what else is on there?

> P9: I'll put what we submitted. I'll just put a handwritten note, you know, this is time sheet submitted or, you know, contract, zero hour contract submitted or what was it I submitted so that I know if it's a work study thing you know it's in their file.

> P9: That way if my work study comes in, they see I submitted their time card or my or my administrative assistant has submitted their time card so they know we've got a process. You know, their pace being worked on and that's a good, you know, that's good for team moral that they know their paychecks getting processed and we're paying attention to them and taking care of them.

> P9: And doing it in a timely manner.

> P9: So, but also we're required to have it. I just had compliance here yesterday. And so, you know, one of the things that, that happened was is that one of the files that happened, the pool was one of my former work studies.

> P9: So [compliance] wanted copies of all of our contracts. Of all of our communications with VA. So you know, a time cards contracts, you know, all that good stuff. So I mean, they would see in our files those word documents that we just print off. With their names and stuff that. We're submitting it, you know, in a timely manner. Submitting our work study's to get paid and we're processing them or doing what we're supposed to.

Tyler: Yeah. Right.

> P9: Because I do check that. When they come in for compliance survey too. So we have to keep all that documentation once we get it, make sure we've done it correctly.

Tyler: That makes sense. And you're talking about timeliness and, and sort of like the importance of like, tracking these things.

Tyler: So on that Word document, it sounds like reference number, definitely like what you submitted, which maybe is like the question field.

> P9: Hmm. Right. Right. Right.

Tyler: And would you also include like the date you submitted it or the date?

> P9: Yes, date. I just put a date and a time that I submitted it and then they know, I did it this when I did it. This is the date I did. If anybody asked, you know, I can say this was submitted on this date at this time...

> P9: And also that helps us if we call them is, you know, if you, you know, work study has been great lately and they're wonderful. But, you know, sometimes they process in date order. So, I mean, you know, and they're wonderful, but, you know...

> P9: Sometimes they process in date order. So knowing when I submitted is important stuff sometimes if I need to ask, okay, it's been a little while and get this one or pull this one out and get it worked if they're backlogged for some reason, you know.

> P9: They haven't in a while but it's happened in the past.

> P9: You know, or if it's 1 where we need it done quickly because there's some extenuating circumstances. There's been times when We've asked paid to be expedited or on the SEO hat side we've had a students that have financial hardships, you know, and we just need it to work that there's something they needed additional documentation they needed so they could work the file and you know because we've had students that need.

> P9: You know, they have car problems. They have, you know, life happens, whatever it may be that went wrong in their life, but they need that money sooner rather than later, then we'll talk to VA and explain what that hardship is, reach out to them and try to work with the, you know, say, Hey, this student's got a problem.

> P9: We want, if we can do something to try and help them out because they need the extra, you know, they need that funding now, not 2 weeks from now, not 2 weeks from now, not 2 weeks from now, they need that funding now, not 2 weeks from now, maybe the difference of them staying in school or not staying in school.

> P9: So, you know, they're good to work with us on that, but we have to know what we submitted. We have to know when we submitted it.

> P9: And you know, in like I said, it's it's just kind of depends on what it is and what the situation is as to how fast or slow but one of the things I love about Ask VA is that Muskogee can see it the same day. Ask a question is a valuable tool.

Tyler: Yeah, for sure I can see that. And it sounds like, you know, you're definitely thinking about timeliness and thinking about like impact on, you know, this Veteran, student especially.

Tyler: Are you ever like needing to like report on like how long it takes you to process. Things or like how many time cards you're processing, like are you ever looking at like the larger picture? If that makes sense.

> P9: Normally, I mean. Normally most of the time, I mean, at 1 point I had 6 or 7 work studies.

> P9: I mean, we just make a list and we just, you know, do, I mean...

> P9: Normally I'm not going back trying to backtrack what I've done unless it's something where it's a compliance issue or they want to see something or I've got a student complaint that you didn't do XYZ, you know, I'm, when I've got a complaint, now I may go back and look at that.

> P9: I got complaints that I have to go back and justify when we did want XYC.

> P9: You know, if I've got a student who's mad. Because the document, they needed a document to be submitted and they didn't get it to us.

> P9: Well, you know, we got, and we jump through hoops and get it done as soon as we receive it.

> P9: But you know, I sometimes have to do a justification if they make a complaint up to higher level I have to go back and create a timeline of okay office did XYZ on this time this and this day trying to solve the students problem and one of the things may be we submitted to VA on X date at X time. We gave it to VA at this point, you know, and you know, we process this quickly as we could within, try resolve the students issue.

> P9: So, you know, so it does come in time, time depends. Student complaints will trigger, you know, me to go back in and look at when did what happen, why when did they turn in their stuff, when did when did we get it transmitted?

> P9: When did we work it? Did transmit it to you all so that could get worked and then one did we discover that they needed additional documentation or figure out residency, you know, comes up the mind, you know, but.

> P9: Surely I don't have to do ask a question for it. So, you know, but.

> P9: There's certain documents that come up over time and you know that is getting to be less now because DoD, VA has access to DoD screens now.

> P9: So, you know, we don't have to do this much submission of some of the documentation from guard reserve units like we used to on notices of basic eligibility and things.

> P9: But. Every once in a while something comes up where you know, they need a document and you know, they are they've asked for information, you know, and Veteran can bring it to us, you know, or like, you're supposed to submit this.

> P9: We're not supposed to submit this, but you know we're gonna do what we have to do to get the student service if it's not that big of a deal to get on ask the question and submit something, you know, in the students behalf. It doesn't take that long. So I mean, if it gets a student service, my attitude is just for my staff and myself to do it.

Tyler: Yeah, for sure. I just wanna clarify one thing to make sure I'm understanding. When you're talking about compliance, is it compliance from the university or from the VA?

> P9: Compliance for the VA. VA comes into in your compliance. I just had a federal VA compliance survey yesterday, surveyor, auditor.

> P9: Now it's right now it's contracted out to, to a contractor, but they work for the VA, if that makes sense, but, yeah, VA compliance looks at work study documents that, we have submitted, you know, and they look at our file.

> P9: So if there was question whether we followed up on payments or not. And you know, in one of the things, and, I mean, my rule on payments for chapter 33 is that. You know, if the amount doesn't match exactly what we submitted, why doesn't it match? And I want an answer.

> P9: We're going to call the SCO hotline we're going to talk to somebody and if they can answer it tell us that's fine but if for some reason they say we need to develop and do it sometimes the hotline you know for whatever reason it's something that may be a require some extra research may refer us to submit ask and ask a question on the student.

> P9: We've got one yesterday that was a debt from 2009. 2009. This is 2024.

> P9: We just got a debt from 2009. From them going back auditing files so you know and when we got the debt we've got a name and we had the last board the social book we were trying to figure out who the student was because we only get a partial name.

> P9: We got the name on that one, but the problem was when we searched our database, that name wasn't pulling up.

> P9: And so I would say we were able to figure it out. Because, it was so old that it was from when our systems had changed over prior to when we went on to banner.

> P9: We were able finally to figure it out by the last four of the social, but we were trying to figure out who this person we got this.

> P9: We just don't wanna pay money out until we verify we know who the student is that they went to school with us at that point.

> P9: You know, and so one of the things that the SCO hotline did was they told to my assistant to submit an Ask a question.

> P9: Now we were able to figure it out without having to submit to ask a question because I was able to find someone who could search by the last four the social and what we're able to luckily figure it out.

> P9: Find that way, but we can't do that now on enrollment manager search by the last four of the social. We used to have that capability on enrollment manager and we don't have that capability now. We add the social when they 1st initiate benefits, but the VA's been told to go away from some security numbers and but since a lot of our information.

> P9: So sometimes they'll show up blast for like on a compliance survey. I could just guide the complaint survey list.

> P9: It was the 1st initial of their last name and the last word their social. So then, okay, who is this person?

> P9: Cause we generally don't save it that way and I don't in my office I don't have a way to search that way so and it used to be we could go on and be a once and search that way but we can't search that way now so we can't an enrollment manager, so, I had to call and get them to send, get me the name so I can figure it out through the names who the person's were that were on the compliance survey.

> P9: So I knew who they were so I could search them. So it worked out, but I did have to do a little digging.

Tyler: Yeah, it sounds like it. Are you what's like the identifier you're usually using to know that a student is who they are? Is it their social security number?

> P9: We're still kind of like VA is, we're using the name, the date of birth, and we're using the Social Security number.

> P9: We like to get the social. You know, but it's been it's in law now that they wanna go away from social security number.

> P9: So I mean, you know, I get it. But we try to use as many identifiers as we can.

> P9: Because problem is that like, for our institution. We have several people who may have the same exact name and the same, you know, father, father son duo's and if they don't put senior and junior there's no there's no you can get the wrong one accidentally get the wrong file you could not realize you know when they contact us and they just say their name you know if the work study happens to pull the wrong file it can really create a headache for us. Now, you know, there we also have a student ID number, but VA obviously doesn't know what our student identifier is that we used to identify.

> P9: So, you know, we use a student ID number to be able to identify so we know we got the right person so we mentioned we're not certifying the wrong person so you know the the problem gets to be when you've got people with the same same name and it's an exact name in the same middle initial.

> P9: It's hard sometimes because they do that. They'll they'll in and we've got 2 or 3 cents and people you know the other thing is when they do that they'll in and we've got 2 or 3 sets of people you know the other thing is when they change their name In a while since they attended and they changed their name is going back and searching so normally we can go back through social and figure that out or go through. You know, depends on where the information is coming from, what we got, if they gave us last for the social will figure, try to figure it out that way.

> P9: You know, if we've got the name and data, we'll try to figure it out that way. We just have to do digging to identify the person.

Tyler: Yeah. Yes. That makes sense. I always, joke that I think I'm the only person in the world with my name because half of my family is French and they can say my last name but they can't say my 1st name and then vice versa.

> P9: Lol.

Tyler: Alright, well, I see the time. We've only got about like 13 min left together and, I do have a couple questions about kind of what we're looking at.

> P9: Yes.

Tyler: So this is like you've come into your dashboard where you can see things and you know this currently exists for Ask VA but it looks different and we talked about some of the information that is missing from here.

Tyler: I'm curious like generally speaking are you coming back into your dashboard and checking that things are have moved from in progress to solved and checking the BA's response or What's that process like for you?

> P9: General, generally we if we've gotten to ask a question, we've got it. We've got a file that we put it on our calendar and we know we will check and wait, you know, to see if we've gotten a response or not.

> P9: Yeah, and generally the I mean, since we get a message that there's a response...

> P9: Now once we get the message that there's a response, that's when it gets a little bit more interesting. Is getting into the response and opening it because you have to get, you have to sign back in to, through ask a question.

> P9: So that was one of the things that like with my new admin person, you know, I was like, she wanted to just hit the response and you can't and she said, I can't get the response.

> P9: And I said, you have to go in to ask a question. But for new certifying officials, it doesn't really tell them that they have to go in that they have to log in again.

> P9: You know, they, they don't read carefully. I mean, I didn't say that, but you know what I'm saying?

Tyler: Yeah.

> P9: You know, But you know, they have to go back in to ask the question and then from there, then, they, once you got in to ask question, then she had to, I think it pops up.

> P9: I'd have to pull and log into response to tell you the exacts, but. I know that I have to go into it automatically defaults I think to your personal Microsoft Account and I wanna I always have to go take it into the Microsoft office the work. My work Microsoft Office account.

> P9: And then I'll hit that. And when I hit it into the that, then I can see the response.

> P9: Now, we have to cut and snip the response. We can't hit print or it'll jumble it up on our printers.

> P9: It doesn't print out clearly for us. So, you know, when we have to do it that way, you know, we can see the response, The only way we're going to get that response is we're going to have to clip it and snip it.

> P9: We can't get it to just plainly out for us. When we go view that response. So you know.

Tyler: Okay, that's really helpful. So. So you're getting like, yeah, you're getting that email and it's telling you have you have a reply but it's hard to then like know that you need to jump to Ask VA, sign in and see the reply... And then it sounds like you want to print the reply just like you printed like the submission and that's because you want to put it in the case file.

> P9: Yes. Well, and plus they may be sending us some responsive things to do. They may be sending us documents to fill out. They may be sending us, you know, they may send sending us a contract. We got to print those contracts out so that the student worked fill it out on time cards.

> P9: That's how they send us the time cards is through Ask VA. So we gotta be able to print that time card out. I can download it and then get it to print. You know, that's generally what I do.

> P9: So, you know, but to just print it directly, you can't, you know, used to be years ago, we got it in email, we could just hit print and you know, print it out.

> P9: But, and I get the security thing, but we just. Just can't just do it. So, you know, theres, but there's some intuitive steps.

> P9: Since I have some new people, that experience of watching them work through it and have to teach them how to do it and...

> P9: They don't intuitively think about having to go in to ask a question to be able to read the response.

Tyler: Right. Yeah, totally.

> P9: Oh, that doesn't that's not something they automatically think of the other thing they don't think of is they see the they see the block and it's automatically one but the opposite one is the one that you have to click it on.

> P9: And you know, it's 1 of those things that, but if that will work if they haven't gone through ask a question.

> P9: So, and get into it, you view it, but then you either got download or you got a you've got is try to snip it.

> P9: Now, I mean, I can download it and then print it, but it's just extra. It's just figuring out the extra steps to get it to where you can save it and download it.

> P9: So I've kind of got her, got her where she knows how to do it now, but it's, you know, I had to really go in there and walk her through it a few times before she started clicking on how to do all that.

> P9: And, and you know, and I sometimes I'm doing workstation, sometimes I'm not.

> P9: So, you know, if I've got a receptionist I've had for a long time or not. So, you know, so even I have to stop and think sometimes, wait and what I do, you know. Yes, I have to remember.

Tyler: Totally, yeah. Yeah, I have 2 questions as we kind of like start to wind down.

> P9: Okay.

Tyler: So one of them is like you've went back into Ask VA, you've signed back in because you want to read this reply. But obviously there's a lot of things in that Ask VA dashboard. How are you finding which one to look for? What's like the piece of information that tells you which question to look for?

> P9: I think it'll always give us, what the, it'll give you a list of what your submissions are. So you know, normally I'm looking for the one that says the top one that says, because I know that's gonna be the most recent and then I have to click on the details to be able to get into the documents to see what VA responded to access the documents and everything else that they've got.

> P9: So, you know, once you get in there, you got, you got an, you know, and so to me, I mean, I always know it's gonna be at the top.

> P9: Normally the most recent one is going to be at the top on the current system. So that kind of makes it easy, you know, because I kind of know the most recent is going to be somewhere towards the front.

> P9: So for what I've submitted now, you know, And if I got 2 or 3 of them submitted, I just have to make sure I click on all of them to click through so that I can go back to that reference number and make sure I've got that printed off earlier and make sure I've gotten all the responses in that I need to get.

Tyler: Right. Okay, that makes sense. So you're, you're using that status and you're thinking, okay, I'm gonna look for the one that's solved, which will be the most recent.

### Question details

Tyler: In our couple of minutes we have left, let's look at that solved one and let's look at the information we can see.

> P9: Okay.

Tyler: So here we've got one solved question. You should be able to scroll. Yeah, hopefully. And then let's check the details. For this.

Tyler: And this in theory would be like the page that you're talking about printing. So I won't.

> P9: And my instinct would be to go to that Brown Tom assigned summer contract. I, the attachment, I'm gonna click on that. That's my 1st instinct, you know.

Tyler: Okay. And what are you thinking? Is that, do you think that's coming from the VA to you?

> P9: Yes. And then from there, they normally send 3 attachments. Normally it's 3 because they'll send a letter that tells us that, you know, this is a supervisor you're responsible to XYZ, then they'll attach a contract but then they'll also attach a time card.

> P9: Yes, so normally I'm seeing 3 attachments on, like something like that, I would see 3 attachments and all 3 of those would have to be downloaded. And would have to be printed. And I put all those are put in [the case].

Tyler: Okay, gotcha. That makes sense.

> P9: And you know and if they let us know you know that their process the time card then you know normally we'll print that out so that in let our work study know that they've told us they process.

> P9: That you know that they're working is gone to Treasury and they should get paid soon, you know, if it's the end of a count if it's something like a time card as opposed to a new contract submission.

Tyler: Gotcha. Okay, really helpful. So you're looking for these attachments that you're expecting from the VA because you want to be able to click on them, print them out, add them to the students file.

Tyler: It sounds like you also would maybe want to print the Va's reply. I guess particularly if you ask them like a question?

> P9: Yes. Yes. Yes.

Tyler: So on this page like let's, have a look around like where is the Va's reply to you?

> P9: Let's see.

> P9: Oh, I see it down below. Yeah see, and the thing about this is I'd have to cut and snip. I would want that part to be printable that's in that box. I'd want to be able to print that somehow.

> P9: Oh, I don't know. You know, the date that they worked it, I'd want that I'd want what they told us to do because That's my, you know, marching orders.

> P9: This is what the VA told me to do. I did it kind of thing. Plus, documentation for the file that, you know.

> P9: So normally what's in that gray box is normally, Normally that's in as a separate attachment and I can print that out and I just print that out and put that in the file along with the time card along with the And if it's an answer to a question, like if it's a pay problem and it's a complex pay problem and they're putting numbers and amounts of money in there.

> P9: We definitely want to be able to put that with our file for our compliance auditor to see that this is what VA is telling us and the way it was worked and the reason why we didn't get paid XYZ.

Tyler: Totally. Yeah.

> P9: You know, for compliance survey and plus the student. Not to mention the students gonna wanna know why they got paid XYZ and it's helpful if we have something printed that we can share with this is what the VH told us, you know, this is the response we got on the VA, why your pay was shorted.

> P9: You ran out of entitlement. You exhausted entitlement on XY, disease, and this is why you only got paid this much money and not the rest, and you're going to now be responsible for the rest of tuition and peace.

Tyler: Right. Yeah. Okay, so you definitely want to print their reply for kind of like multiple reasons and is it clear like how you could print their reply on this page?

> P9: I'm assuming I could click it and let's see...

Tyler: You might not be able to click things, but you can describe to me what you would do.

> P9: I'd probably snip it if I couldn't [print] because I don't see it. I don't know that I see an easy... a way to print it. Does that unless I hit expand all I don't know if that helps or not?

> P9: No, it didn't do anything. So, so I probably have to go in and snip it and make it snippet and make a snip it and put it into a Word document.

Tyler: Got it. Okay. So you probably go in and copy it.

> P9: And see that's. Yeah, yeah, which, you know, which was what. I met with my assistants, I think I include that in my initial email.

> P9: With that, you know, it's, you know, now, I don't care.

> P9: I'm fine with snipping stuff and putting it into Word document to print, but it is more steps.

Tyler: Yeah, for sure.

> P9: So I get that might and if it's really long it's hard to get a snippet to include the whole thing.

> P9: Does that make sense? So, you know, if it's a really long response, we generally, you know, would like.

> P9: It'd be easier to be able to have something where somehow we can either you know download it or so that at least download it, if not be able to, you know, print when we open it up to be able to do the response.

Tyler: For sure. Yeah, I can see how that's like a whole another step and a whole other document you have to create that makes that makes a lot of sense.

Tyler: Let's look at the rest of the document. So we if we scroll up a little bit we I know we have the reply from the VA at the bottom and the date and time and then up at the top here we've got some information about your submission so we've got the question and we've got some details like the day you sent it.

> P9: Yeah.

Tyler: And then we have the status and the reference number. What else would you need on this page if you were gonna print this page?

Tyler: Like if we made this page something you could print.

> P9: The main thing I'd be looking at is instead if I was going to print it, cause it'd be nice if the stuff that's...

Tyler: Yeah, tell me what you're thinking.

> P9: Send a reply... It'd be nice if we almost if the your question and their response was here. Send a response was either to the side or below it. Because that way it makes a streaming conversation and it's in chronological order.

Tyler: Right. That makes sense.

> P9: Because you have to do, if you have to do 2 or 3 responses back and forth. On a complex issue. And you have to go back and try to read that. It makes sense of that because you're doing like for me if I got a complaint and I'm having to walk into this case cold and say see whether or not my staff did what they were supposed to or responding.

> P9: t's nice to be able to read it in chronological order what happened. This would be hard because you've got response up there at the top.

Tyler: Right. Yeah.

> P9: Is it going to show the prior responses? Is it going to? You know. I mean, we would make copies as we went.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P9: But I could see where it would make more sense to have what VA responded right below the submission. Or down below it so it would be in chronological order. So here's if I had to print this out or if I had to go back and relook this.

> P9: I'm going to see the response was done here. This is what the, this is what I put input.

> P9: This is what the VA responded. This is what I asked when I didn't agree with what VA said... You know, sometimes if it's something that we're not, sometimes we have to come back and say, now, wait a minute.

> P9: We're not, we're not in sync here, you know. Where you get that number from, you know, and you know, when it's math, you know, that just happens. It's not that we're trying to be argumentative. It's just we want to make sure everything's right. And you know, so it's nice though when I'm trying to justify somebody did something right.

> P9: I want to see what that when it was submitted first. I want to see the VA's response to what we submitted and then I and then if my person responded then you know. What? They responded to that. You know, and to explain it to a parent or a Veteran.

Tyler: Alright, totally. No, but I get what you mean. You it seems like throughout our conversation. Yeah, and you want...

> P9: I'm very logical and how I approach so that I want it logical. I wanted in chronological order. I want it to make sense.

Tyler: Yeah, and you need to be able to track it. So that's the that's the logical way of tracking it.

> P9: Yes.

Tyler: So I completely understand what you mean, with how like the conversation feels a bit like. Separate right now and you wish that it kinda like just went in order this is the latest thing that happened then this happened and this happened.

Tyler: That makes a lot of sense. We're just over time and I don't want to take it too much of your time today.

Tyler: But you can feel free to stop sharing your screen when you like. There should be a button kind of around the top of your screen that's red.

### Cool down

Tyler: Perfect. And in these last couple minutes, do you have anything else you wanted to ask us or share with us?

> P9: No, I mean ask a question is really Like I said, it's a great tool. We really like it, right?

> P9: I mean, personally, I like ask a question. It's not one of the ones I have to fuss with a lot on having problems with, you know, It's just, the only thing is the trying to print out responses gets a little interesting, but.

> P9: You know, that seems to be the heart. I think that's the thing.

> P9: And I asked my senior assistant who's been with me 4 years. And she said. That was her thing was the printing out is the stuff [the VA's response and attachments].

> P9: The main thing I wanna see ask a question keep is that quick accessibility. For the VA to be able to access it quickly. It's very important because that's part of what's very critical in ask a question for us, because that sometimes is the only way that we can transmit stuff to be a in a very quick manner if we need to and there's just situations that arise with payments and people were having, you know, real problems and if we're trying to work through a real life problem or students in critical need, then that quick accessibility for us being able to submit it, being able to see it almost instantaneously is huge.

Tyler: Yeah, for sure.

> P9: So, you know, so as we do improvements, my hope is that we don't lose that. You know, ability because that's key in being able to do some of the things we use this tool for to help our, our mutual students.

Tyler: Yeah, for sure. No, our hope for sure would be to not. Kind of like mess with the efficiencies that are set up, especially for you all who are submitting a lot of inquiries per month.

Tyler: And your feedback about the print thing is really helpful. I think that's such a Like that's a problem that we want to look at.

Tyler: I also remember from your email now that you mentioned another issue about this is not really related to dashboard that we've been talking about, but to actually creating your submission, like asking your question, and folks choosing the work study topic.

> P9: Yeah, so this is on the second page when you go in to. As you know, I just noticed when I was training someone. Because she was new and I just did it so it was just kind of pressure on my mind, you know, and when I was training her when you go in to the that creates this the submission then...

> P9: I can't remember if the second or the 3rd blog where it's the work study is like on the second page.

> P9: It's done on the 1st page at the 1st set of choice or the second, 1st set of choices. It's on the second set of choices. And I was like, I'm looking at her because I've done it. So I know to go look there, but I get it. As if you know to go look there, but I get it.

> P9: As if you, you know, because if you're new, you know, knowing to know, to go to that second page or realize it's there I don't know.

> P9: Any way for it to get switched in to the bottom of the 1st page or not, but it might make it easier on some of the newer work studies like coordinators or or something that just gives them a cheat sheet of where to go, you know, on the choices that they're gonna have to go to the second page to to do this selection.

> P9: And I realize that's a long list of selections, but you know, so I get it and I get it, they're important, but sometimes you're guessing, you know, like the 1st one you have to choose the education benefits even though you're submitting work study.

> P9: That's not necessarily intuitive for a new person because they're like, well, it's getting for work studies, education benefits. Am I clicking the right thing?

Tyler: Right. Yeah, that makes sense. That's really good feedback. We've noticed some potential problems with those lists as well.

Tyler: So when, when we move to VA.gov, there should, hopefully they're improved. And obviously, if they're not feeling that way, then we'd love to get more feedback on that.

Tyler: At the minute, the categories called education chapter (303) 335-1606 etc and work study And in the future we're hoping it would be more like education benefits and work study. So hopefully just even that shorter label will help.

Tyler: And then in terms of like not being able to find something until it's on the second page, that's another problem we are hoping that in this new version of Ask VA, all of the options in the list would be visible.

> P9: Yeah.

Tyler: So you're still gonna have to do that scanning for work study and it'll be alphabetical, but it will be visible from the 1st time you open that.

> P9: Yeah, and that's kind of what I was going for was that just it I knew it didn't I knew it's gonna be the in the alphabet but it just wasn't intuitive for her and so I thought.

Tyler: For sure.

Tyler: But in, you know, normally when you all ask me questions, you're looking for what, you know, and I just trained a new one. So that was kinda. And that was just something I noticed that you know wasn't intuitive that I had to help her with, you know.

Tyler: Yeah, for sure. I love that perspective of like both someone like yourself who has done work study and school certifying official things for a long time and also trains people to do it for the 1st time because that's really helpful perspective.

Tyler: [P9] this conversation's been so awesome. I'm already excited to kind of like go back and watch the recording and kind of learn all the new things that I probably missed and in everything you shared.

Tyler: And I just want to thank you so much for your time. It was really, really helpful.

> P9: Well, it's great to meet you and thank you for the opportunity to provide input. I appreciate it very much.

> P9: Okay, yeah.

Tyler: Take care.

> P9: Blessings.
