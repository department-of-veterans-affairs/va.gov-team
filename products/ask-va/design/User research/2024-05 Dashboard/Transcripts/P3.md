### Warm up

Tyler: Alright, so are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio today?

> P3: Yes, ma'am.

Tyler: Perfect. So at this point, that was a lot of information. Do you have any questions for me?

> P3: I don't think so. No.

Tyler: Okay, well, let's go ahead and get started. Before we jump into getting your feedback. It's helpful to learn a little bit about yourself and your experience with the VA. 

Tyler: How long have you been a veteran?

> P3: Since 2020.

Tyler: Awesome. So a couple of years now, did you start interacting with the VA, right as you got out of service or...

> P3: Like 6 months after.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: How do you usually get in touch with the VA?

> P3: Well, to get in touch with my doctors I use a lot of the secure messaging.

Tyler: Okay. Secure messaging.

Tyler: Yeah. Anything else?

> P3: No, it's pretty much it, because every time I try and call I either get put on hold or I get hung up on.

Tyler: Okay, right. So you have a little more success with secure messaging. What about if you needed to contact the VA not about your healthcare. Do you know how you would start?

> P3: Probably just, I would just click buttons on my healthevet or the the va.gov, when I log in and see what happens.

Tyler: And okay.

Tyler: Yeah. So a little bit of like wishful thinking, but not exactly sure the best avenue, especially if calling is, hasn't been successful.

Tyler: That makes sense. Have you ever heard of something called Ask VA?

> P3: I have not.

Tyler: Okay, I'm gonna show you what it is on my screen. Just so you have an idea, and give you a little bit of background. So I know it looks like you're on your phone right?

> P3: Yes.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: So I'm going to share my screen. And you're going to be able to see what I'm seeing.

Tyler: This is Ask VA. It's an online tool that Veterans can use to ask a question.

Tyler: So you might come on here and ask questions about. Like all different topics it could be about your healthcare, or like housing assistance or disability compensation.

Tyler: The idea is that you would get in touch. You'd get put in touch with somebody who works on that at the VA.

> P3: Okay.

Tyler: So you'd fill out kind of like an online form that we probably are familiar with, right?

Tyler: Okay. And so what we're gonna do for this hour is we're gonna pretend, like you're kind of familiar with Ask Va, we're gonna say that you've used this form to ask a couple of questions in the past. Okay.

Tyler: Do you have any questions about Ask VA at this point?

> P3: I don't think so.

Tyler: Okay, cool. And you just need to have a kind of a basic idea of what it is. And any other questions we'll talk through together in the session.

Tyler: Okay, so now we're gonna shift gears. And I'm actually gonna have you share your screen. So since you're on your phone. I'm gonna send you a a prototype that you should be able to open on your phone. And so I'm gonna send it in the chat right now on Zoom, and it's gonna show up on your screen. And if you can just click that link.

Tyler: Let me know when you've got the link open.

> P3: It's loading right now.

Tyler: Okay, cool.

Tyler: So while that's loading, if you want to come back to zoom where you can see my face, we're gonna have you share your screen. Is that something you've done before?

> P3: No, not on zoom.

Tyler: Yeah, okay, no worries. So we'll work through this together. I'm obviously not able to see your screen. But from Zoom, are you seeing any kind of controls or settings at the top or the bottom of the page?

Tyler: Can you tell me what you're seeing?

> P3: At the bottom. Yes.

Tyler: At the bottom.

> P3: There's a record and a yeah, there's a record and a share and a post captions.

Tyler: Okay, perfect. So let's click on share.

> P3: Okay.

Tyler: And then what are you seeing next.

> P3: Screen.

Tyler: Okay, yeah, let's share screen. And then hopefully, I'll be able to see exactly what you're seeing in a moment. I'll let you know. Yeah, perfect. Okay, so I'm seeing exactly what you're seeing. It says you are sharing screen and then if you could just navigate to that web page that we just opened.

Tyler: Yeah, perfect.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So it looks like it's still loading. Right? Is that how it looks for you?

> P3: Yes.

Tyler: Okay. So we'll give it a minute to load.

> P3: Says loading.

Tyler: Hmm.

> P3: Try again.

Tyler: Interesting.

Tyler: What about this? Do you know how to open a new tab on your browser here with that little button. Yeah, perfect. Can you just open like a new tab? And it may be for Google, and we'll just see if it's the Internet, or if it's my link.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: It seems like it's loading pretty quickly.

Tyler: So maybe it's the link. So what I'll do is you can keep sharing your screen just as you are, and I'm gonna resend that link in the chat. Okay.

> P3: Okay.

Tyler: So since you're not on the zoom page anymore. Oh, maybe you are back on perfect. Yeah, you're good.

> P3: Like oh, I guess.

Tyler: And then we'll just try and open that up.

Tyler: and if it's not working still, it might be it might just be a really big web page, in which case I can always share my screen.

> P3: Yeah, it loads, but then it doesn't show up.

Tyler: Yeah, I can see that.

> P3: Which is weird. I've never had. I've never had that happen before.

Tyler: Yeah, I think it's probably that it's quite a big website. It takes a long time to load even on my computer. So why don't? Why don't we do this? We'll have you stop sharing your screen. I think, up at the top where it has like that red dot, you might be able to. Yeah, perfect. So I'm not seeing your screen anymore.

Tyler: I'm also not seeing your face.

Tyler: Okay, now, I'm seeing your face. Okay, perfect. So I'm gonna open it up on my screen now.

Tyler: Thanks for bearing with me.

Tyler: Alright.

Tyler: So I'm gonna share my screen.

Tyler: Are you seeing that on your side?

> P3: Yes.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So it should say Ask VA.

Tyler: And what we're gonna do is because I'm sharing my screen. You're gonna tell me things like where you would click, or if you want me to scroll down or up. Okay.

> P3: Okay.

### Dashboard

Tyler: And we can work together to navigate. So we're on this page. It's we can see we're on. Ask. Va. It, says Jordan, up here at the top. So we'll pretend like that, says [P3], and we're signed into your account. Okay.

> P3: Okay.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So I'll go ahead and scroll down a little bit, and I'd love for you to tell me what you're noticing on this page. What's what are you noticing first?

> P3: Well, there's a, you can ask a new question. If you ever have any questions.

> P3: And then it looks like it's got a history of all the questions you've asked.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: Yep, so this looks like these are questions, you've asked in the past and then also, you know how to ask a new question that that's really helpful. Let's look more closely at these questions that you've asked in the past. So like, what do these dates mean?

> P3: Is that when they responded to your questions?

Tyler: Which date are you looking at in particular? Can you tell me?

> P3: The 26th where it says new on the status.

Tyler: Okay. So it says, status new. And then it says, last updated May 26th.

> P3: Yes.

Tyler: Okay. So you're thinking that might be when there was last an update on the question. That makes sense. Let me scroll down to this one. So this one says May 25th and then it's solved.

Tyler: What's May 21st up at the top?

> P3: So is that when they, when you initially ask the question.

Tyler: May 21st.

> P3: Yeah.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: So there's the date you asked the question. And then there's the date that it was last updated. What would that mean?

> P3: On the last time that you either got a response or they solved your issue.

Tyler: Okay, cool.

Tyler: And you mentioned new up on this one. And then this one says, solved, can we talk a little bit about the statuses. What is that?

> P3: So I'm assuming the solved is your issue was resolved, or whatever question you had was answered. And then the new is your new question with the response.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: That makes sense.

Tyler: So we're seeing some questions that are solved does that imply there's definitely a response from the VA.

> P3: With my experience? Probably not.

Tyler: Okay, tell me more about.

> P3: They may have given you an answer, but it's not the answer that you not necessarily want to hear. But the answer that you needed.

Tyler: Okay. And what's the difference between? Like, I think I know what you're implying by that, like the difference between what you want to hear and what you need, and then maybe what they gave you. Tell me a little bit about those differences.

> P3: I know, with me, in the past, when I've dealt with the VA. I've asked questions, and they gave me an answer. But it wasn't the answer... it wasn't necessarily asking or answering the question that I originally asked. They were kind of answering another question that I didn't have at the time.

> P3: And so I've had to go back and reword the question. So they understand, like what my actual question is.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. And are, you usually is that like, when you're speaking to someone on the phone are you typing things and they're reading it.

> P3: A lot of times is when I'm typing.

> P3: Okay, is sending out an email to the either the VA. Or the my healthy vet.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: And there's just like almost like a breakdown in communication like you're trying to ask for one thing. And then that's not.

Tyler: That's not clear to the VA. And they respond about something else.

> P3: Yes.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. So when you see solved here your 1st kind of reaction that you said to me was like they might have replied, but that might not be an answer to my question.

Tyler: Is that right? Okay.

> P3: Yes.

Tyler: What else do you think would need to happen for it to be solved? Is it? Is it just that they've replied? Is there anything else.

> P3: I feel like to have it completely resolved or solved. They would have to have you answer like. So I know in the past where I've gotten emails. They ask if this answered my question or this was like what I needed.

> P3: And then and then there's been a couple of times where I said yes, so they close out the ticket, or they cancel or resolve, I guess they close up the ticket.

Tyler: Okay, yeah, that makes sense. So maybe a little bit of confirmation on your end, too. Not just the VA?

> P3: Yes.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: Okay, what does this mean? Where it says, healthcare?

> P3: I have no idea.

Tyler: Yeah. And then this one says, housing assistance and home loans...

> P3: Oh, I'm assuming that's the like, the topic of the discussion.

Tyler: Okay, yeah.

Tyler: Why do you think that's there?

> P3: So it gets forwarded to or sent to the right person.

Tyler: So that's why there, there's a topic.

Tyler: Why do you think that on this website they're showing you the topic.

> P3: So you know who the question is getting sent to. Because sometimes there's been times why, I've had questions about like my disability rating, and it gets sent to like the people that do all the pay and everything. And that's not.

> P3: Before. That wasn't the question that I had, so it got sent to the wrong person, so they had to send it to somebody else.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So it helps. You understand who's gonna be answering your question and almost confirm it's the right person or got sent to the right place. Okay.

> P3: Yes, ma'am.

Tyler: That makes sense.

Tyler: So we've got a bunch of questions in here, and I know you didn't actually ask these questions. But we are pretending like you did.

Tyler: So there's this question here, and it's from October 13th last year, and it's about home loans.

Tyler: So let's say, like you know, here we are in June, and you're you're talking to someone, and you're remembering that you asked the Va question about home loans, and you want to go back and find their response, you know, like you kind of can't remember what they said. And you want to figure it out.

Tyler: So you're signed into this website, you know, and there's a lot of questions here.

Tyler: How are you gonna find the one that says home loans.

> P3: Maybe, if, like you do the excuse me, click on the status, and if the issue is already resolved, you can see what is in that I guess the solve category.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: so you might sort to look through just your solved questions. And then you'd be you'd have like a smaller pool of things to look through.

> P3: Yeah. And then you could change the date to I don't know what the, depending on when you asked it, like, their last updated. Excuse me, the last updated status.

> P3: So if it was one of your older questions or newer questions.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. So that that felt pretty clear that like kind of how you would use each of these options.

Tyler: Are you expecting to be able to search? Or do you think that's enough for you to be able to check the status?

> P3: Feel like it would be more. I feel like it'd be more convenient to be able to search, like if I knew it was going to the like I've excuse me. It would be easier for me to search like, if I had a topic for the question.

> P3: So like home loans, or whatever that we'll go back to the home loan, one that the and like the topic of that question, or whatever I type in, for the topic would be like home loans or whatever I feel like. It'd be easier to search by topic or by name.

Tyler: Okay.

> P3: It seems like it's a lot a lot of work going through and searching all the closed and all you're updated. Because if you have other questions with your home loan, or your pay, or whatever it might be harder to scroll through it all.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense. So using like the topic that we talked about earlier like healthcare or home, loans would maybe be an easier way for you to search.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P3: Family.

Tyler: Yeah, I can totally see that. We've talked about a couple of different things in this box. Is there anything else you're noticing that you want to point out.

> P3: You can click on the details, and I'm assuming it expands the message, or whatever it was.

Tyler: Okay. And when you say, expand, what are you picturing happening? If we clicked on check details.

> P3: So it cuts off at the primary P. So I'm assuming it would be the entire message.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: So you feel like, if you click check details here, then you'll be able to see, maybe on the same page you're going to be able to see, like the full question.

> P3: Yes, ma'am, or it would bring you to another a different like page.

Tyler: Okay. That makes sense.

### Question details

Tyler: Alright. So let's go ahead and click on check details. So we're gonna go to this question here. On May, you asked on May 21st. And we're gonna see whether the VA replied to you. Okay.

Tyler: And this is gonna require you to tell me what you would do. So if we get to the page, and the 1st thing you would do is scroll. Then you let me know. Okay.

> P3: Okay.

Tyler: So I'm going to click check details.

> P3: So I would. I would scroll down to see down to the conversation and then I would read those messages.

Tyler: Okay.

> P3: So I'm assuming that's the response that they just sent me with the CHAMPVA and everything, because that's the latest update. I guess.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: So, you're thinking, this is probably the latest update and it's probably a response from the VA. How can you tell it's the latest update?

> P3: Because it's 1st one on the conversation.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P3: They're the newest one. And then it would say, response from the VA. Or if you type the message, it would say like.

> P3: I don't know what it would say response from you, or whatever.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: Okay, cool. Well, I'm gonna give you a moment to read this. I know it's a little bit long. So take your time and once you've finished, I'm curious to hear your reaction to their response.

> P3: I feel like it's pretty straightforward.

Tyler: Okay.

> P3: For that question, and then like it says at the bottom to apply, you'd go to that, or, if you have any questions, reach out to your VAMC.

Tyler: What's a VAMC?

> P3: I have no idea.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P3: I see it a lot, though, and it usually gives me a phone number. If I have a question, I'll call it.

Tyler: Okay.

> P3: I usually don't have any questions after they, for the most part, after they respond.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So your 1st reaction is that it's feeling straightforward. It gives you a link to kind of do something not really sure what VAMC is, but you've probably seen that before. Okay.

Tyler: And if you were reading this reply, let's say, like, you know, you've sent the VA. Your question. You're reading this reply, and it's still not feeling clear to you like you're like, I'm not really sure what to do next.

Tyler: What do you think? What would you do?

> P3: I'd attempt to call the number on the bottom of the screen, but not have high hopes, because getting a hold of anybody through the VA with the phone numbers never worked.

> P3: Or you put on hold like last time I tried to call I was put on hold for an hour, and then they dropped the call.

Tyler: Right. Okay, yeah, that's not great. So you might try and call, but pretty low expectations there.

Tyler: Is there anything else you could do.

> P3: I don't know if you'd be able to respond to the message that they just sent.

Tyler: Do you want me to scroll?

> P3: Sure, sorry.

Tyler: That's okay.

> P3: So you could type. If you go all the way up and you can send your reply.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P3: And so if you have any questions there then. And that's what I like about the like, the secure messaging, because  there's no proof that you called, and with the.

Tyler: Okay.

> P3: Messaging they have to get back with you within think it was 48 hours.

> P3: And then you have proof that you tried to you attempted to message someone.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: So it gives you some peace of mind that this is being logged and is trackable.

> P3: Yes, ma'am.

Tyler: Call, okay?

Tyler: So we found this reply, it looks like, we can type in here and then we'd be able to reply back to the VA.

Tyler: Before we think about replying.

Tyler: Just going to scroll up to the top. So we've got some information up here. Can you talk me through what information we're seeing. You can just go down the list.

> P3: So you have your initial question.

> P3: About being 70 disabled, and then your dependents getting healthcare.

> P3: And then the details I'm assuming is who it got sent to the healthcare department when you sent it.

> P3: And then the status it was technically solved, even if it didn't answer all your questions. And then your reference number.

> P3: So I'm assuming that's that like, if you have any questions to the you can go back to that reference number or talk to somebody over the phone about that reference number.

Tyler: Okay. You think there's any.

> P3: Like your record, I guess.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense. So it's it kind of makes it easier for you to find this inquiry. If you were going to talk to someone else.

Tyler: Is there any information that's missing here? I know you haven't used? Ask BA. Before, but any ideas you could think about.

> P3: I don't think so.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: yeah. I mean, it's it sounded like, the main task on this page is is you're wanting to read the reply from the VA, and then, once that's done, we talked about finding a way to reply.

Tyler: Okay, so let's go to this reply here.

Tyler: And we're gonna pretend, like we are writing a reply to the VA. We can't actually write in the type in the prototype today. So I'm just gonna click on this box. We're gonna pretend like you wrote out your reply.

Tyler: Okay, so now we're seeing a reply. We're pretending like you typed it. What would you do next to send your reply to the VA.

> P3: Click, send in the bottom corner bottom, left corner.

Tyler: Alright. I'll go ahead and click on Send.

Tyler: And then I'm going to give you a moment to read this and let me know what we're learning on this page.

> P3: It confirms that you have sent your reply for your response, and then at the bottom, there, it says, you should receive a reply. Within 7 days.

> P3: If we need more information to answer your question, they'll contact us or contact you.

> P3: Return back to like return back to the Ask VA. I guess the initial page.

Tyler: Yeah. Okay. That's helpful. Is there anything missing from this page? Any information missing?

> P3: I feel like you already know who it's getting sent to, but it would be a little bit more of a peace of mind to myself that it says who it got sent to. And you're talking like in a general sense, like healthcare, or are you speaking like more specifically.

> P3: Well, it would be nice to have it be more specific, but I would be happy with just that. The healthcare, or that general.

Tyler: Yeah. That makes sense. Okay.

Tyler: And you mentioned this link here, that would take us back to that page that we started on right.

> P3: Yes.

Tyler: So I'm gonna go ahead and click on that link. We're gonna pretend like you're finished here, you're gonna go back to kind of where you started.

Tyler: And so now we're back on this page.

Tyler: And I'm gonna scroll down a little bit, and I want you to tell me if you're noticing anything different about this page.

> P3: So the case was reopened. And so there's no solved or resolved, or whatever the status was, the status has changed.

Tyler: Okay.

> P3: With the latest date. That you changed it. I'm assuming, was the May 27th.

Tyler: Yeah. Does it make sense that it's reopened, or?

> P3: Yeah, I think so, because you wanted you sent them a message back asking them for more details. Or you had more questions about that dependent healthcare topic.

Tyler: Yeah. So because you've asked a follow up question, it's no longer solved.

Tyler: Let's talk a little bit more about the statuses. So I'm gonna open this up so we can see them. So we've got new. What is new?

Tyler: If you I know that might feel straightforward. But.

> P3: I'm assuming. That's just the new messages that they've sent you.

Tyler: Okay, that's the new messages.

> P3: And new response, new responses, new messages.

Tyler: Okay, got it. So the new like reply from the VA.

> P3: Yes.

Tyler: Okay. And then, what about in progress?

> P3: So I would think that would just be them working on the response or working on the issue that you have.

Tyler: Okay, so they're kind of like, busy in the background.

> P3: Yes, yes, ma'am.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: And then solved. We've talked about a little bit, but just reiterate for me what would solved mean.

> P3: That your question or the information that you needed has been sent to you, and you're happy with your response.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: So on both ends. We've kind of closed the loop. We feel like the situation's kind of finished and then reopen. We just talked about, so that might be. You've reached back out to the VA and now your question is reopened.

> P3: Yes.

Tyler: Okay. So we've got these 4 statuses. Is there anything you would change about them? Is there anything confusing or like you wish that it was different. Or maybe there should be another status, or one of these shouldn't be here.

> P3: I think they are all. I would like. I'd like to see them all, cause it just gives me a more a better peace of mind that I can sort through, and I can go. Oh, like I had this question. Did it get answered yet? Or if I reopened the more than one message or question, then I could just go through and sort through and see it.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: So it kind of helps you with sorting, like we said, and then also you kind of know what's happening with with the question, so you have a little bit of maybe it's like more tracked.

Tyler: what about the order of these questions like, what order are they in right now.

> P3: It looks like they're in the order that you originally asked. Each question.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: Do you think that makes sense?

> P3: I feel like to me. I feel like it would be easier to have them ordered in your. So when they responded so like the latest updates.

> P3: Which I mean it looks like it's that way. But it also looks like it's when you 1st ask the question.

Tyler: Okay.

> P3: Dates.

Tyler: Are you? Are we finding it like hard to decipher with the similarity in the dates.

> P3: I think so. I feel like the case is reopened. So I get why, that's on the top. But I feel like the date at the very top should change to whatever the latest update date was.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: That makes sense. So it's hard to like the May 21. Date is very easy to notice. But it's actually the day. What day is that again?

> P3: The last update was the May 27th So.

Tyler: Okay.

> P3: It just. It would make me frustrated because I know I already asked the question, or I had another question, but I see that May 21st so in my head it's like.

> P3: Well what happened to the date that I originally asked that next date that we reopen the case.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: so may 21st is the day you 1st started this process. So the 1st time you ask the question. Is that a helpful date?

> P3: I think it is because then well, for me it would.

> P3: I would know that, hey? I asked this question on the 21, st and then with the update, it would let me know how long it took to get the question answered.

Tyler: Okay.

> P3: But it also would make me mad sometimes, because, just depending on how long it took them to answer that question.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: So it's helpful for you to see that like you open this question on May 26th.

Tyler: Well, that's a that's a silly example. But you open this question on May 21st, and their last update was May 27th.

Tyler: So you have an idea of like kind of how long it's taking for you to get a reply. Yeah.

Tyler: Does the date?

Tyler: Does the date help you remember?

Tyler: The question like, Would you remember like, oh, I remember, I asked this question about healthcare on May 21st or is that not really how so brain works?

> P3: Yeah, no, that wouldn't help me.

Tyler: Okay, yeah, do you think.

> P3: The little summary, the little summary helps. But the the date just that doesn't do anything for me.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense. So the little summary you're talking about like I'm 70 disabled. Do my dependents get healthcare? That's the little summary.

> P3: Yes, ma'am.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: Yeah. So that makes sense. So that that May 21st isn't really as helpful it sounds like the question being, there is really helpful. And then also, we talked about like that healthcare label being helpful.

Tyler: Yeah, that that makes a lot of sense to me.

### Cool down

Tyler: We are kind of reaching the end of my questions about this prototype. But I do want to leave any space. Is there anything else you want to tell me about this page we're looking at.

> P3: I don't think so. I think, I think this would be something that I would actually use in the future. Now that I know about it.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: Why do you think you'd use it?

> P3: Because it's much easier to do that than the call.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P3: And if I have any, if I have any questions, I can just type them out, and I don't have to worry about waiting for somebody on the phone, or talking to like my primary care or my secondary care providers to have them try and forward it to the right person, and then wait for that forward to get responded to and. That whole telephone game.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: So are there instances where you're reaching out to your primary care provider sort of knowing like the questions. Not for them. But they're the easiest person for you to contact at the VA.

> P3: Well, usually for me. I go to my specialty care providers, because I never can get a response, or my messages can never go through to my primary care when I use secure messaging. It seems like.

Tyler: Got it.

> P3: So a lot of times I'll ask my secondary care. Providers like my neurologists and my other, usually I use my neurologist because they get right back to me.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense.

Tyler: So you're like, it's kind of hard to find that like good front door at the Va. And like once you found it. You're like, I guess I'll just go back to this person.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. Well, I think that's good news that this might seem like something that you could use in the future.

Tyler: So right now it's not on va.gov. But this tool does exist, so I'll make sure that the folks who follow up with you after the session they send you a link in case you want to use it in the meantime.

> P3: Okay, that'd be awesome.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So I stop sharing my screen now. It looks like we're a little ahead of time. We'll probably end early. But for the last couple of minutes. I just love to like spend a little bit of time reflecting. What do you think of that tool overall? It sounds like you'd something would use. Is there anything that could have been easier.

> P3: I just think, like we discussed with the searching. So you can search your actual like topic or your question.

> P3: And then, like the whole, the whole date thing was kind of confusing, and would probably make me upset.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

> P3: Those are all.

Tyler: Later.

> P3: But otherwise it's but oh, sorry!

Tyler: That's okay. I think there's a delay. You go ahead.

> P3: Okay, but otherwise overall. I think it's really helpful, and it has a lot of helpful information.

Tyler: Okay.

> P3: And it's nice to see that the the the question that I asked, or the summary or part of the question, is there too?

Tyler: Yeah. Why do you think that that is helpful? I know you sort of explain that to me in the session. But why is it helpful to have that summary.

> P3: For me. Just so, I know, like, Hey, I talked to the healthcare department about like the CHAMPVA. Or like I talked to the excuse me, the payment department, or whoever the Home Loan Department is for the Home Loan information and using the VA Home Loan.

Tyler: And is that because.

> P3: What I asked them, or what we talked about.

Tyler: Does that go back to the like? You can track it versus like a phone call there's no tracking that like on this day you called the VA.

> P3: Yes.

> P3: So peace of mind that you actually have proof that you talk to somebody and not, or you sent them a message and not you didn't call. I don't have a message.

Tyler: Why is that important to have, especially with the VA.

> P3: It's reassuring, because there's there seems to be. I mean, there's a hundred 1 million veterans. So I understand that there is a lack of communication. But then, again, there's that lack of communication where.

> P3: like anywhere else, if you'd ask a question to somebody or like in the civilian side, when I go to see my chiropractor.

> P3: If I have a question, they get right back to me, where, as like sometimes with the VA. I ask a question, or I try and call and like at my chiropractors office.

> P3: I can call them, and then, if they don't answer, they'll leave a message, and they'll get back to me within that day, whereas it seems like sometimes with the VA. It's days later.

Tyler: Okay, yeah.

Tyler: So a large part is just that, like, you're anticipating a lack of responsiveness on the Va side. And so it's important that you know that you've asked questions on certain days, and you fall. You can follow up with them and things like that.

Tyler: I think that makes a lot.

> P3: Assessment.

Tyler: And I can see how that's a frustrating position for you to be in.

Tyler: I think you've answered all of my questions. Did you have any questions for me? It might be about the tool we just looked at, or whatever.

> P3: I don't. I don't think so. It's pretty pretty straightforward, and it's

> P3: Once it actually gets implemented. If it ever does, I feel like it's going to be a very useful tool.

Tyler: Awesome. Yeah, I mean, I think that's good to know and good to hear and like I said it right now it exists. But it's not on VA.gov, it's on a separate website, so I'll make sure they send you a link. But hopefully, in the future, in the near future, you'll be able to use it on. va.gov, too.

Tyler: Well, thank you so much for joining us. Your feedback's really really helpful. I know. It seems a little silly when I'm asking you to describe, like what each word means, but it's really helpful for us, so that we know what to to fix the folks who set up this research session. They're gonna send you a thank you. Note with some information, and if you have any questions. You can reach out to them.

Tyler: But I hope you have a lovely rest of your day, otherwise.

> P3: You, too. Thank you.

Tyler: Awesome. Thanks, [P3].

Tyler: You're welcome. Thank you.

> P3: Bye.
