### Warm up

Tyler: Alright. So the recording has started. Are you comfortable? If I record my screen and audio today.
 
> P7: Yes, that's fine.

Tyler: Okay, perfect.

Tyler: Well, that was a lot of information. Do you have any questions for me at this point?

> P7: No, but you did say it was gonna take an hour. I do need to briefly message my classmate, to let them know my schedule really fast.

Tyler: Cool. Yeah, go ahead. Do you want to do that right now?

> P7: Yeah.

Tyler: Okay. Cool.

> P7: Alright sorry for the delay.

Tyler: No worries. And if you need to pause at any point, just give me a shout.

Tyler: Awesome. So before we start to look at something and get some of your feedback. I'd love to just learn a little bit more about your experience with the VA. How long have you been a Veteran?

> P7: So I got out of active service in 2016.

> P7: So I've been utilizing the VA services pretty much since then. The first couple of years I wasn't utilizing it as much. But then I've definitely been utilizing their services. And then, since 2019, upon moving to [State], I utilize the VA even more so because it was more accessible.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: That's really helpful. So and when you're talking about VA services is it mostly like healthcare, or are there, other ways. You're interacting with the VA.

> P7: Yeah. Mostly, healthcare.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: Cool. Have you contacted the VA before?

> P7: Before when?

Tyler: Oh, sorry! Just in general. Have you contacted the VA?

> P7: Yeah, so I've had a disability claim put in and so I'm actually in the works of submitting a new disability claim, so I haven't submitted it yet, but I'm preparing everything in order to submit it. And then I work as a student Veteran assistant on campus. So I'm familiar with having to utilize the VA and access their website to gather more information in regards to education benefits. So I'm kind of familiar on that. 

> P7: And regarding helping students navigate a little bit as to where they can find answers that we don't necessarily have in our office because of the fact that the answers come from the VA. So. Sort of familiar with that education side of it.

> P7: And then I typically just use personally the VA for my healthcare because my GI Bill has since been exhausted, so I don't really have any more education benefits.

Tyler: Okay, that's really helpful. That sounds like a that'll be really useful to hear your perspective, both as a Veteran yourself, but also helping other Veterans to learn some things about how the VA works. Have you ever contacted the VA online? Like using, for example, the chatbot?

> P7: I have, in order to essentially see how I can contact my healthcare provider. So I've done it before, where it was a quick, like, how do I contact them? And then it kind of, I think, led me to where I can contact the facility in my region.

> P7: But there's also the app that I utilize, and that kind of has own messaging. So I've utilized that also to get a hold of my care provider.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So sometimes you're using, you're messaging your healthcare provider through the app that that's really helpful. Have you ever heard of something called Ask VA?

> P7: Yep.

Tyler: Okay. Do you know if you've ever used Ask VA?

> P7: I've used it once, and that was regarding an educational benefit question that we had. And so we messaged them through that. And then eventually they've responded back.

Tyler: Okay, awesome. Well, I think that'll be really useful to hear about your experience with that, and maybe a little bit of comparison throughout the session today.

Tyler: So the next thing we're gonna do, we're gonna shift gears a little bit and I'm gonna send you a link in the chat on zoom and I'm gonna ask you to open the link on your phone and so let me send that first.

Tyler: And once this is open it might take a second to load. Just let me know what you're seeing on your end. Okay.

> P7: Okay. It says. The page that you are looking for cannot be found.

Tyler: Okay, that's not right. Let's see if we can find a better link.

Tyler: Let's try this one again and let me know what you see when you click that one.

> P7: Nope, same message. Your report can't be found.

Tyler: Okay. Interesting.

Tyler: I'm gonna try one more. And then if this doesn't work, I've got a backup plan.

> P7: This one works.

Tyler: That one works. Okay. Yep.

> P7: Ask VA.

Tyler: Awesome. Yeah, that's perfect.

Tyler: Alright. So now it's open on your phone. And what we're gonna do is have you share your screen on, Zoom. Have you shared your screen on your phone before?

> P7: Sorry. I just clicked the link again.

Tyler: No worries.

> P7: I've used zoom before on my phone, but I haven't specifically used the share.

Tyler: Yeah, no worries. So if you're back at zoom and you can see my face, you should have probably a bar at the bottom of your screen with some different options, you might have to click on the middle of the screen to see them, and there should be one that says share. Oh, there you go!

> P7: Perfect.

Tyler: Awesome. So now I'm seeing your screen, I'm seeing exactly what you're seeing. It looks like it says you are sharing screen. And then, if you just navigate back to that link that we just opened.

Tyler: Oh, it's still loading. Perfect. Okay. So now I can see something that says, Ask VA, and if you want, it might be a little easier for you if you just swipe my picture away.

Tyler: Yeah, perfect.

Tyler: Okay, great. So. Now, I'm able to see your screen, but that also means I won't be able to see your face, which is totally fine, but I might need you to be a little bit more verbal, so I know you're still with me.

> P7: Sounds good.

### Homepage to sign in

Tyler: So we're not gonna click on anything yet. But you can feel free to scroll around. And as you're doing that, I'd love for you to tell me out loud what you're noticing first.

> P7: I'm noticing that this page is kind of making it evident that this is a source for assistance, but that if you're expecting immediate assistance. This is kind of not the spot, and they do provide insight as to where you can go if it is urgent.

> P7: That's the first thing that I notice.

> P7: And then I do think this the layout with everything being structured, does make it a bit easier to read. I know some sites they kind of don't necessarily have the way the captions – the titles. They kind of make it easier as to like when you're scrolling where you it gives an indication as to where you need to look, whereas some websites you kind of have to skim everything in order to kind of look for the answer you're searching for, whereas with the big bolded sections. You know, indicating different kind of areas. It makes it a little bit easier, in my opinion. When I just scroll, and I'm kind of looking... It is a little more structure than some websites.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense, that's really helpful. So like the headings are helping you find things more quickly.

> P7: So yeah, yeah the headings.

Tyler: Yeah, that's really helpful. And you said it looks like it's a place where you can get help, but not immediate help. So there's other places to go for that.

Tyler: That's helpful. What's this page specifically for? Then is it about getting help?

> P7: I definitely think it is. It's a place where you can, you know, submit questions that you have that like, I said, aren't going to be urgent, but. It's a place that is a good starting point, where, if you don't know where to seek these answers from, I think this gives you a good starting point.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense. Awesome. So for the rest of our conversation, we're gonna pretend, like, you need to ask the VA a question. So I know you've already used your post 9/11 GI Bill benefits. But we're gonna pretend, like, you know, in this scenario, you're trying to figure out whether you're eligible for Post 911 GI Bill benefits.

> P7: Okay.

Tyler: So you've come onto this website and you're like, here I am. I'm gonna ask a question to the VA to figure out if I'm eligible for this. And I'll remind you of this scenario as we go along.

Tyler: So without clicking on anything. Yet can you tell me what you would do first to ask the VA a question?

> P7: So first, I would definitely read through this to find out if this is where I should submit my question, or if I could be navigated to a different part of the site. Specifically the education benefit portion and see if I can't get my question answered just from the website alone.

> P7: And so, if I could I would probably look to see where I could find the education benefits first before just submitting and ask a question. So I would probably navigate to that site first, and then scroll through there and see if I already don't. You know, can answer my question on my own, just from the website.

> P7: And then, if I couldn't, that's when I would definitely submit my question to the Ask VA.

Tyler: Right. Okay, that that makes sense. So you'd first prefer to figure out if you can do it on your own. And then let's say that you couldn't figure it out. So you ended up here. You're ready to ask the VA a question. Where do you feel like you would click first?

> P7: I think I would click to sign in.

Tyler: Okay. And why do you think you'd sign in? Do you have to sign in?

> P7: I don't think you would need to sign in. I think, if I recall last time I was able to just pull it up and submit the question. And then it kind of gave me... what was it called? Essentially like a file number that they gave me basically saying that they received my question and that they would get back to me.

> P7: I can't remember how I had done it. So okay, that's the reference number is where you could check the status of your question. I think it was...

> P7: But I'm not too sure as to where I would go specifically to type in the question. I did it last time on the computer and my boss was the one that helped me navigate to it. So I would assume I would need to sign in first, just to make it a little bit easier.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P7: I hadn't done it on the cell phone before with the Ask VA, so being that there's no specific spot like immediately here to type in my question. I would likely navigate to signing in, assuming that it would make it easier for me to find where I would put that in.

> P7: But that's just an assumption.

Tyler: Yeah, that that makes a lot of sense, though, like, you're looking for a place where you can type in your question. And since you're not finding when you're like, maybe if I sign in, then I'll figure that out.

> P7: Right.

Tyler: Yeah, awesome.

Tyler: And you and you also mentioned that the last time you used Ask VA, it felt like it was like more upfront when you were putting in your question.

> P7: Yeah, I can't remember if my boss had already navigated to the Ask VA portion of it, but she helped me pull it up and she goes, yeah, you just type in your question here, and then they'll give you a reference number and like respond back. So you'll just have to check periodically.

> P7: I was like, okay, and then that was the case. But I hadn't navigated it on like my cell phone or anything.

Tyler: Yeah, right. That makes sense.

Tyler: Okay, cool. Well, it sounds like in this case you would have chosen to sign in. So let's go ahead and pretend like you're gonna sign in. So you can click on that sign in button.

Tyler: We won't actually have you put in your sign in information for today. But we're gonna pretend, like you put in your username and your password. And you did the whole thing. So you can click on login.gov.

Tyler: And then, oh, that's okay. I think maybe you closed out of it. Yeah, perfect.

### Through to submission

Tyler: Okay. So now we're gonna say, we're signed in. So up at the top. It says, Hector, and it would actually say, [P7], this is you signed into your account. Okay.

> P7: Okay.

Tyler: So describe to me what we're looking at next. What's this page.

> P7: Okay. So now, it's slightly different in that it does have what appears to be a button that I could click on to submit my question, whereas that wasn't there previously.

Tyler: Is that kind of what you were looking for previously? Or was it even a little bit different to that.

> P7: Yeah, that's what I was looking for [before I signed in].

Tyler: Okay, so some way of sort of starting.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. And you found that link pretty quickly on this page. Is there anything else on this page you want to tell me about.

> P7: I do like that it has this option right here to, again, remind you that this is for non urgent questions. And then I like that it provides you the information, in case it was something for pertaining to suicide or health, or anything like that. So I do like that that is there.

> P7: And then this part right here where it says your questions, the fact that it says you haven't submitted question yet. That's helpful. In case, for example, I thought I submitted it, and something happened. I got disconnected or something. It's nice to know that there's a spot that I could see. That's kind of updating me and letting me know the status.

Tyler: Awesome. Yeah, that makes sense. If you did like. Let's say you started to submit one. And you got disconnected like you said, are you expecting to see that half finished question here.

> P7: Yeah, I would. I would expect to see something along the lines of your question has not been submitted yet.

> P7: Similar to how it's there, but an indication of like, obviously, you've started one. So it would say something along the lines of like to complete your question, or you know your question has not been submitted yet. Do you wish to complete it?

Tyler: Got it. Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: Okay, cool. Well, let's continue with this scenario so we're saying, you wanna ask the question, you know, am I eligible for Post 911 GI Bill benefits? So show me what you would do first to start that.

> P7: I would navigate to the question button.

Tyler: Okay, and what are we seeing here now?

> P7: So this is going to... This says category. So I'm assuming it has to do with the category of my question. So I would check, and being that I'm looking for education, I would click on that one.

> P7: And then, oh, see, I do like it's got to finish this question later. See? That's convenient. And then this portion here, noting that I have an ID request number, so that to me is reassuring. In that things are being documented. I know that's a big issue for a lot of Veterans is we seek help, and sometimes those actions are not documented that we've sought the help, and that can be detrimental to us.

> P7: For example, for our disability claim, or even just getting assistance with educational benefits. It's nice to have things like recorded and tracked it. It gives us validity in that, we're, you know, trying.

Tyler: Yeah, yeah, I think that's a really helpful reflection. So you mentioned it's reassuring. And it's helpful to know that, like your efforts are being kind of captured and you're not going to lose them.

> P7: Right.

Tyler: Yeah, I get that. Awesome. Let's continue on to the next page. So we'll say you chose education benefits.

Tyler: And then tell me what we're seeing here.

> P7: Okay. So now that my category and topic have been selected or my category has been selected. It says to pick a topic. And so let's see. I'm assuming I'm using the post 911.

Tyler: Yeah, in this scenario. That what we assume. It sounds like you found that quickly in the list. What was your reaction to seeing that list when you first opened it?

> P7: My immediate reaction was while there's quite a bit of options to choose from. Which does make it a little more tailored which is helpful.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So it felt like, because there was a lot of options, it was more tailored.

Tyler: Awesome. Okay. Well, let's go ahead and continue on to the next page, and then walk me through this page.

> P7: Okay. So this one is asking me, what is my relationship to the Veteran? So I do like that it does have the option as the SCO. So that's who I was working with previously when I did use Ask VA, so in that situation I would have selected that optoin.

> P7: And so now that I'm the Veteran, I'm obviously going to select the Veteran.

> P7: But this is nice. In that, say you were getting assistance from a family member. It gives that notion that it's not the Veteran themselves doing it.

> P7: And so again, that again goes back to this person needed assistance. And there's options to indicate that it wasn't specifically the Veteran doing these, asking these questions or these services. So again, it goes back to being able to have that record and it's more tailored. So it's just giving more specifics to the situation.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And I was curious to hear, if because you mentioned at the beginning helping students, I was curious to hear if it was related to a SCO, and it sounds like it was. So it felt like that option was what you would choose in that other scenario where you're helping out other students. That's perfect.

Tyler: So in this case we'll choose I'm the veteran, just like you did. And we'll go ahead and continue on to the next page.

Tyler: And then again, in this scenario we are imagining that you're trying to find out whether you're eligible for GI Bill benefits. So what do you think you would choose in that scenario?

> P7: I would definitely choose I am not sure.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P7: I'm not sure. I don't know why it's not letting me pick that...

Tyler: Yes, that's just the prototype, so you'll have to ignore that for a second. But that makes sense. You choose I'm not sure. If you were trying to figure out if you're eligible.

Tyler: Right. Okay.

> P7: Because again, it's nice having the option of, I'm not sure, because it gives more, it's more specified as to where. No, yes or no. There there isn't. It doesn't provide that room of a person being unsure, which is, if they were sure they kind of wouldn't necessarily be here asking this question.

Tyler: Right. That makes sense. So you like having that option that you're not sure, and that was very quickly what you would have chosen in this case that makes sense to me. So you just ignore this. But we're gonna choose no just cause. That's what the prototype wants us to choose, and we'll click on continue.

Tyler: And then on this screen. You're not actually going to be able to click on things. So just describe to me what you would do on this page.

> P7: So I would use the little arrows, and then select the state that my school is in, and then same process with the residency state, and they would both be the same in my position.

Tyler: Right that makes sense. And do you feel like you have to provide both the School State and the Residency State.

> P7: I think so, in that, some students may be attending a school, that's in a different state, but they reside in another one, and that could be the case whether they're still partially, say they're reserves or something like that, and they may be on the border close to 1 one state, and so they're actually able to go to another state. So there could be different reasons as to why they would be residents of another state. And that's and that's just common with Veterans, I think, or with people in the military I feel.

> P7: There's always issues in regards to residency because of the fact that, you know, we're, a lot of us were active duty, prior, and so we still contain, like our residency, to where we went into. And so living in one state, you know, it can become complicated. And so I think having that as an option just allows for that room of some people that it's – things aren't cut dry. They're not just black and white. And so, I think, having that option highlights that.

Tyler: Yeah, that's helpful background. So do you feel like given that, that residency state might be interpreted differently for Veterans, or or folks who are still in the military, do you think that it's specific enough here?

> P7: It could probably be more specific.

> P7: And again, that is because of the fact that some people there's just not sure of their residency. Because of the fact that, like I said, they were active duty at 1 point. Now they move to a new state, or they're only in that state because of their service... Because I know some people are serving while still attending school, and so that can kind of complicate things.

> P7: And then our state has certain regulations as to when the person becomes a resident and things like that, so it can get a little murky, so maybe even including as not a requirement, but an option of stating like when they became a resident. Or if they're if they're unsure about that. Or even like how you would determine. That would be helpful, too.

Tyler: Right. A little bit more information about like what it means to be a resident. Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: Awesome. That's super helpful. So we'll just pretend in this case that you put in your school state and your residency state, and then you can continue on to the next page.

Tyler: And tell me what we're seeing here.

> P7: Now we've gotten to the portion about my actual question.

> P7: The subject, and then the space for us to submit the question itself.

> P7: A well as areas to upload pdfs, jpgs, photos, which is also convenient. In case there was documentation that was giving validity or something in question, that the student or person wanted to include.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P7: Oh, cause I know, for when I used to Ask VA it was a question that wasn't something that was necessarily going to be easily determined just from the website alone. It was a very like specific situation in regards to like, the student was adopted. And so there was certain things that came into that with them, getting the chapter 35 benefits and name changes and different things like that. And so it was quite complex. And so, being able to ask that question and have the opportunity to provide, you know, for example, if we had to send them that student's birth certificate, and then proof of their name change, and things like that in order for them to be recognized. So that was part of the things that we had to do. And so the option here that that's I like that. They have that option right there.

Tyler: Awesome. That makes a lot of sense. So that's really helpful, especially drawing on your previous experience of helping out a student and like where you need to get really specific and where you might need to upload files.

Tyler: When we started this process, you were kind of looking around for a place to put in your question. Now, seeing this page. Is this what you were expecting to see earlier? Or does this make more sense now that you're seeing it in this way? What's your reaction there?

> P7: I definitely think this makes sense. What I was looking for earlier was essentially what was provided upon logging in. So I was looking for that little link underneath it to essentially bring me to this point.

> P7: And so I do like that there's these prior questions [before sharing your actual question], because again, it's getting it to be more specific, that way they have a better indication, and they can direct that question to the right department immediately, and I feel like it saves time.

> P7: [Compared] to waiting, having somebody have to read your question, and then them delegate as to where it should go, you being able to provide that little bit of information, prior, I think, helps speed up the process of getting your answer. Getting your question, answered.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: So it feels like, now that you're seeing it. This makes sense that you'd give a little bit of information. Then you'd give your question.

Tyler: Awesome. So let's pretend, like you put that information in. You put in your subject and your question, and maybe you uploaded a file and we'll continue on to the next page.

Tyler: So on this page, we're gonna imagine that it says [P7] for the first name, and then it has all the information on this page is your information. Okay?

> P7: Okay.

Tyler: Why do you feel like this information's already filled in?

> P7: Well, I already logged in. I'm assuming it just pulled my information from my account.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

> P7: And that's pretty helpful that I wouldn't have to go through and input all this stuff, especially since I had already logged in.

Tyler: Is that an experience you've had before with VA websites?

> P7: I think so. Just having to. Yeah, fill out everything.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: Cool, okay. So it feels clear that the information on this page has been filled in because you signed in so let's pretend like you reviewed it. Everything looked good, and we'll click continue.

Tyler: And now, same thing. Here we're imagining this is your information.

Tyler: So let's pretend like you noticed your phone number has changed. And this is your old phone number. And you wanted to edit it. How would you do that? Can you describe it to me?

> P7: I would assume that I could just click on it and then edit it, right then and there. And then I would probably make note of it to update it after I've submitted my question. Just to ensure that if they did contact me they would have the updated contact phone number.

Tyler: Okay, so tell me more about that. You're saying like, you would probably click in there and you'd added it and then you're saying, and I would probably make note of it to make sure it's updated. Are you updating it? In a second place? Then.

> P7: I would likely, after submitting the the question, just stay logged in and then go update my profile information.

> P7: I guess if there was option for it to be like, Oh, phone number like. If there was an option to say this, this is the updated number, or something like a box that you could check to say, you know, this number has been updated, or something. That would also be really convenient.

Tyler: Right okay.

Tyler: So it kind of feels like on this page. It probably wouldn't update everywhere. And so you'd wanna make sure it was updated everywhere. Once you finished your task.

> P7: That would be my assumption.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

Tyler: What if on here it said you can't actually edit your information on this page, but if you want to edit it here, follow this link, and you'll go edit your profile, and then you have to come back to the form. How would you feel about that whole experience?

> P7: I would feel like it would be like inconvenient. I think it would be more convenient to be able to edit it right here.

> P7: And then again, if there was a little box check that you could check to say, update this as my current number or current email address that way. It would just that we would have that assurance that it's done. You won't have to go through the process of afterwards going and double checking.

Tyler: Yeah, okay, cool. So you'd prefer not to have to like, go somewhere else, do the thing come back to the form, or even if you did it afterwards. Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: Okay, cool. Well, let's say you updated your phone number here. And then we'll go ahead and continue on to the next page, and tell me about this page.

> P7: Okay. So this is asking the reason I'm contacting us. It would obviously be a question, cause it, it does say, ask VA. But it is nice that there's other options here. If I had a suggestion. Okay, yeah. And then just the fact that there's like options. I like that.

Tyler: Yeah, what do you like about having options?

> P7: It feels more tailored. And again it's specified. So I feel like it would lead me to the correct area. As to who would be able to answer my questions. And there would be less, I guess, ambiguity about whether or not it's going to the right people to answer my question.

> P7: If that I had a suggestion, I feel like it wouldn't necessarily be given the same priority as a specific question. So, being able to indicate that I think also gives priority to whatever it is that you're submitting.

Tyler: Right. Okay, that's really helpful. So you like that. There's options. And also it sounds like, in general, you'd prefer to like, give more information. So your question gets sent to the right place and is answered in the right order and all that kind of thing.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: What if I told you that this question didn't determine where your question got sent, or who answered it?

Tyler: How would you feel about this page?

> P7: Hmm. Then it would almost feel redundant because the link itself is, Ask VA, so it's kind of an indication that you're already seeking an answer to something. So it's like you're already... They should already know you're asking something or you're seeking help or guidance.

Tyler: Right. Okay, that makes sense. I can see why it feels redundant in that case. Perfect well, that's really helpful, let's click, I had a question, and we'll go on and continue.

Tyler: Describe this page to me.

> P7: I like that. It gives the little status bar.

> P7: And the option to review and submit. That's always nice. You're able to edit some answers on this page, you may need to return to the earlier page in order to form edit.

> P7: Hmm okay. yeah, this is, this is nice.

Tyler: So you like, you like having the option to review your information? Is that what's nice about it?

> P7: Yeah, certainly.

Tyler: And when we first got to this page, you noticed the the status bar, was that something that was new did you notice that at any point earlier?

> P7: Yeah, I noticed it throughout, and it's, I think it's visually pleasing to know just how how much you have left to complete it, and that kind of almost gives you a little bit of an indication as to like how much longer you're gonna kind of be answering questions, or, like, you know, going through the form itself. So that's I like that. That's it's just visually pleasing.

Tyler: That makes sense.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So and you like the fact that you can review your information on this page. Do you think you'd want to review all of your information, or just a little bit of your information? Would there be a focus?

> P7: I would definitely make sure my question was correct, and then I would just double check that my personal information was as well correct, especially if it was something I knew I was looking for a response back. Whether it be email or phone, I would ensure that those were correct, especially if the option to edit it wasn't there before. Again, I would make sure that that was all up to date.

Tyler: Right. Okay.

Tyler: Awesome. Well, it seems like, you've gotten to the end and let's pretend like, you reviewed this and it was all looking good, and so we'll go ahead and submit your question.

Tyler: and then I'll give you a moment to read this, and let me know what this page is telling you.

> P7: Okay, this is, I like that it gives you the reference number. It allows you to have a sense of, a little bit of not control, but it gives you a little bit of security. And knowing that there's the tracking of it to know that. Okay, there it was filed. And then the receiving the confirmation email again, along the same lines of okay, I have it documented that my question was submitted. And so that's a nice indication that okay, it went through.

> P7: And I know that from 7, you know, within 7 business days I can expect a reply by email. So again, that goes back to  ensuring that my email was correct. And so that's reassuring that I double check that.

> P7: And so this just provides you that little bit of what happens after. And so it provides you that little bit of information that you would have after submitting your question like, Oh, when can I expect a response? Well, it tells you here. So that's good.

Tyler: Awesome. So it feels like it's it definitely answering your questions and you like that there's a reference number, and I guess it goes back to what you were saying earlier about like reassurance that this is this has been submitted. Someone's gonna look at it. There's a way of you tracking it.

> P7: Mhmm.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense to me.

Tyler: So we've reached the end of the prototype. So we can actually have you stop sharing your screen now, and we'll just come back and chat  for the rest of the session.

Tyler: perfect.

### Cool down

Tyler: alright. Well, we went through the whole process. I'm curious what you thought of it. Is there anything that you liked about that process?

> P7: I did like how it was... It was slightly convenient in that. It didn't bog you down with like all of the information at once. It was like that slow progress bar. But it was like, Okay, answer this portion here. I like that it broke it down.

> P7: And that again goes with being able to stop. Say, you had to take it, for some reason you had to stop, and then you can return back to it. I like that it's in those little sections.

> P7: And then it does have that progress bar. So it makes it visually appealing as well as convenient, just to fill out.

Tyler: Yeah, that's a really helpful summary. It feels like having it chunked up makes it a little bit like more manageable while you're doing it. And then also, like you said, maybe it's a bit easier when you come back to it. If you didn't finish.

Tyler: And what do you think could have been easier about that process?

> P7: Not too sure. It was pretty easy.

Tyler: Yeah. And I guess, like, you know, obviously, you used Ask VA previously, and you might have like a vague memory of how that worked do you feel like there's anything that feels different about this experience from from what you remember.

> P7: It might be a little more detailed. I'm not sure if I remember the whole sign in, fill out your name and all of that stuff, but I do remember being able to like indicate that I was asking a question essentially, not specifically pertaining to me. And then I remember being able to fill out the space and then submit it and get getting the reference number and the confirmation email.

> P7: But I don't remember it being so tailored to me specifically, and filling all that information. Again, my boss, she might have filled it out prior to getting to that point. Because, again, she did help me get to that. And she was like, oh, yeah, here just says, and then type in your question. So then it seemed a little more streamlined when I did it with her, but that was over a year ago.

Tyler: Yeah, that that makes sense. So it felt like a little bit faster. And maybe you had to give less information, and, like you said it felt a little bit more streamlined. That's really helpful.

> P7: It did feel like it took a little more back and forth before getting the answer that we needed [last time]. So I feel like, had we already submitted all that other information, it would have kind of made a little more apparent that we were asking a question on behalf of a student and kind of avoid some of the back and forth.

Tyler: Yeah, okay, that makes sense. So you feel like, maybe some of the information you were giving in this form, although it might have been more information, it could actually help you get a a better answer sooner. Yeah, that's helpful.

Tyler: I wanna talk a little bit about how long the process felt. So you said it felt like it, maybe had a couple of more questions than the previous version that you used and and while you were filling out the form, you you weren't really mentioning the progress. The status bar. But you did mention it at the very end. As you went along. Did you feel like you knew how much longer you had left?

> P7: Yeah. As I was progressing, I would periodically notice it and see it 55 or whatever the case was, and so that gave me a little bit of a indication as to okay, like, I'm almost through this form or this thing. The submission will be done. So it did help, and that it gave me like a little bit of a sense of how much was left to go.

Tyler: Yeah, do you think that that was necessary? Like, what if you didn't have that? What would that be like?

> P7: I feel like it might be a little more dreadful in that, you could kind of click the next one and be like, oh man, when is it gonna end? So I like that it has that status bar to indicate, like, okay, especially if you go from 1 one page to next page, and then, you see quite a jump, say, from like 40 to 55 like, then that's an indication that okay, you know, it might only be a couple of more before it's complete.

> P7: It helps, in that, you're kind of being able to visualize how much longer this will take.

Tyler: Gotcha.

Tyler: that makes sense. So it kind of like gave you at least enough of an idea of how much longer it would be. That that makes sense.

Tyler: And we talked about what would happen if you kind of put down your question and you came back to it later, and you told me where you would expect to find it again. It was kind of on that that page where it said your questions, and it said you hadn't submitted a question yet. And so that's where you'd probably think to come back to once you got a response from the VA.

Tyler: So let's say you submitted this question. We did today together, and you. You got a response from the VA would you need to sign in to see your response?

> P7: I wouldn't assume you would need to sign in. I would assume that,  in the same manner that they sent the confirmation email, I would assume that they could, you would also get a response and you would get an email version of it. So I'm thinking that you could probably just check your email. But then, again, you were to use VA.gov, I'm assuming you would have to log in to see it. Because it would be tailored to you.

> P7: So I'm assuming that that's the way they go about it.

> P7: But being that, they said email, I would check my email first.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense.

Tyler: I think that's all of my questions. I do wanna, save a little bit of time for you to ask me any questions in case you have any?

> P7: Let's see. I don't think anything that come into mind right now.

Tyler: Yeah, no worries.

Tyler: And it could be about obviously what we talked about today, or about research or whatever. But it's not a trick question if you don't have anything to ask me.

Tyler: Well, thank you so much for your time. We really appreciate you spending the time with us to do this. It's super helpful to get your feedback. And you noticed a lot of things that maybe other people wouldn't have noticed, or things that other people have also said, which is really helpful.

Tyler: so I think at this point, that's all from me. The next steps as far as the research, Perigean, they're the folks who set up this research session. They're gonna send you a thank you note once we're finished, and they're also give you information. You can pass on to other Veterans if they want to do something like this in the future as well, and if you have any questions you can always reach out to them.

> P7: Sounds good.

Tyler: Awesome. Well, I hope you have a lovely rest of your day.

> P7: Thanks you too.

Tyler: Thank you. Bye.
