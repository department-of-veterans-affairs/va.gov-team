### Warm up

Tyler: Okay. So the recording started, I just wanna confirm that you're comfortable. If I record my screen and audio today.

> P9: Yes, ma'am.

Tyler: Awesome.

Tyler: At this point, [P9], do you have any questions for me?

> P9: No, ma'am.

Tyler: Okay. Well, I think we can get started. I'd love to just learn a little bit about your experience with the VA before we start to get your feedback. I'm curious, how long have you been a Veteran?

> P9: I've been a Veteran since 2015.

Tyler: Okay. And when you became a Veteran in 2,015, did you start interacting with the VA right away?

> P9: No. The end of 2016.

Tyler: Okay. Cool and how are you interacting with the VA? Do you use healthcare? Do you regularly contact the VA?

> P9: I use... It's my primary health care. I do have private insurance since I am married. But I use the VA exclusively for my care. I also use their secure message system to interact with my doctors and with the pharmacy for medications that I'm on.

Tyler: Okay, awesome.

Tyler: And you said you use secure messaging. Do you ever contact the VA in any other way?

> P9: I mean, phone calls, you know to set up appointments and stuff like that. But.

Tyler: That makes sense. And have you ever heard of Ask VA? Or sometimes it's called AVA?

> P9: Yeah, I've seen all the apps. Because I get the weekly emails from the VA, what's going on, and all the apps and everything.

Tyler: Okay. Well, that's great. So what we're gonna do next, [P9] is, we're gonna shift gears a little bit. We're gonna start to get your feedback. Okay? So in, instead of having you share your screen on your end, I'm gonna open something up on my screen, just because I know you've had some connection issues, and I don't wanna cause any more frustration.

> P9: Okay.

Tyler: So what we're gonna do is I'm gonna open up a website on my screen. And then I'm gonna share my screen with you. So you can see what I'm looking at. Okay.

> P9: Nice.

Tyler: Right, so you should be able to see my screen now. Let me know what you're seeing. What does it say at the top?

> P9: Ask VA.

Tyler: Okay, perfect.

### Homepage to sign in

Tyler: Awesome. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna look through this together. And since you're looking at my screen, you're just gonna have to tell me things that you would click on, and I'm gonna guide us through it. Okay.

Tyler: Alright. So before we click on anything, I'm gonna give you a moment to look at this page and let me know if you want me to scroll down, or anything like that.

Tyler: And as we're doing that, I'd love for you to tell me what you're noticing first.

> P9: The sign in, and then you communicate secure securely about specific details of your benefits.

> P9: And can fill in some of your information stuff like that, and you know it probably uses, you know, like ID.me, or something like that for a sign in... Yep, login gov and id me. Yup.

Tyler: So you're noticing right away that you can sign in. You said to communicate securely could fill in some of your information. And then you're obviously familiar with some of the VA sign in methods. You mentioned.

> P9: I work for the government. So I use a lot of these sign ins too.

Tyler: Okay, awesome.

Tyler: And what do you think this page is about? What's the purpose of this page?

> P9: It says get answers to your questions about VA benefits and services.

Tyler: When you see, get answers to your questions about VA benefits and services, what types of questions, do you feel like, you could ask?

> P9: Yeah. Well, I mean eligibility right off the bat. Whether you're eligible for the benefits. It's probably everything. I don't know if it's just the VHA, which is the Veterans Health Administration. Or also includes the VBA. The Veterans Benefits Administration, which is the disability side and burials and stuff like that. VA mortgages.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. So that sounds like you have a pretty good understanding of like different parts of the VA.

> P9: I've done all my own claims. Yeah. For the disability part, so I'm educated on the VA. And how to navigate the system.

Tyler: Okay, awesome.

Tyler: And when you see this, would you expect the VA would reply to your question right away? Or would it take a few days or weeks to get an answer?

> P9: I know with secure messaging it says, you know, within 24Â hours. At least my team is very quick. I get an answer by the end of the day.

Tyler: Okay cool. So do you think you're comparing this experience to secure messaging? You're thinking it might be similar or the same?

> P9: Most likely, if it's you know, if it's set up by the VA. I would think it would be similar.

Tyler: Okay, cool.

Tyler: So for the rest of our conversation, we're gonna pretend, like you need to ask the VA a question. Let's say that you'd like to learn whether you're eligible for the post 911 GI Bill benefits. Are you familiar with the Gi bill?

> P9: Yes, I'm actually using chapter 31 VR&E. Right now.

Tyler: Okay, awesome. So let's say that you know before you realized you were eligible to use chapter 31.

> P9: Readiness and employment.

Tyler: Right. Yeah. So let's say, before you realize you were eligible for VR and E benefits, you were at the point where you're like, I want to figure out if I'm eligible to use education benefits. I want to learn if I'm eligible for post 911 GI bill benefits. Okay?

Tyler: And I'm gonna remind you, the scenario as we go along.

Tyler: So I'm not gonna click on anything yet. But just tell me where you would first what you would first do to ask the VA a question.

> P9: Look like you'd have to sign in. That's most likely is probably gonna have a dropdown box. And you know what you would want to do, or maybe a box where you can put your question in. I don't know the system whether it routes it to the particular agency you want to deal with. Or you know, if it has a dropdown box, it says, education benefits, health care, stuff like that.

Tyler: Okay, cool.

Tyler: So you're expecting to sign in. And then you kind of describe to what you're expecting after that point which is helpful.

> P9: Something on the homepage explaining, you know what the app does and what you can do in the app.

Tyler: Uh huh, okay, cool. So I'm gonna go ahead and click on sign in, because that's what it sounds like you do first.

> P9: Yes, ma'am.

Tyler: Okay, so let's do that. And then, does this look familiar to you?

> P9: Yep. I have to do it when I use the va.gov app.

Tyler: Right. Okay, cool. And so for this session, we're not gonna actually have you sign in. We're gonna pretend like you're signing in. So I'm gonna click on Login Gov, and we're gonna imagine you're doing the whole thing where you put in your email address and your password and and so forth. Okay?

### Through to submission

Tyler: And so now we'll say that you're signed in. So it says, Hector here, we'll just pretend like that, says [P9]. Okay, so you're signed into your account.

Tyler: and you're seeing this page. Now talk to me about this page. What are we seeing here?

> P9: You see the green arrow where you can ask a new question. Probably opens up a box where I can type in my question.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So you're thinking you might click on ask a new question. You'll be able to type...

> P9: Below. That is the most important thing. Non urgent questions. It's urgent, go to the emergency room or call 988.

Tyler: yeah, and tell me, why is that the most important thing?

> P9: Because, it's gonna take a while to get an answer. And if you're in an emergency situation, you need help immediately.

Tyler: Yeah, okay, cool that makes sense.

Tyler: Anything else, you want to point out to me on this page?

> P9: Well, it's tell me I haven't submitted a question yet. And below it's saying, if you need help, there is an 800 number.

Tyler: Cool. So if you were going to ask this question about whether you're eligible for Gi bill, benefits.

Tyler: Can you tell me where you would click next?

> P9: I'd click ask new question.

Tyler: Okay, I'll click on that and then tell me what we're seeing here.

> P9: Select Category. So it would give you a dropdown of education, disability, debt, healthcare decision reviews, any technical issues, housing, assistance, Veterans readiness and employment, survivor benefits, pensions and overseas, so foreign medical program, life insurance deers. And if you're really, you know, not in with yourself. The last one is, somebody's got to take care of you, the guardianship, custodian, fiduciary.

Tyler: okay, cool. So I can tell, you're really familiar with a lot of VA programs, just from how you read through that list.

Tyler: And so were you expecting to see something like this?

> P9: Not everything.

Tyler: So this feels like it's more than you were expecting.

> P9: Yes, yes, it. You know, it's VA website you have to go to the bottom and click on each individual one to figure everything out.

> P9: We're on the va.gov, you know, but this has everything where you can click right away, and it takes you right to it.

Tyler: So it's surprising that, like, it's all in one place? How does it feel that it's all in one place?

> P9: Very user friendly.

Tyler: User friendly. Okay.

> P9: Yeah, somebody that's you know, very not technologically advanced could navigate it.

Tyler: Okay, cool. That makes sense to me. And so in this scenario, we're asking about the post 9 11 Gi. Bill benefits. What would you choose in this list?

> P9: Education benefits and work study.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So let's go ahead and choose that.

Tyler: Is there anything else you want to tell me about this page?

> P9: That it saves your progress as you go along.

Tyler: Okay, cool.

Tyler: What does that mean exactly?

> P9: So if you get disconnected and you'll sign back in and you probably log in again. It will allow you to start where you stopped.

Tyler: Got it, yeah. How would you find where you left off? Like, if you went back the next day? And you're like, let me finish what I was working on. Where would you find that unfinished question?

> P9: I guess you would click that green box there. We saved your progress. It has a request ID. So somewhere in there.

> P9: I don't... Oh, finish this question. But not finish this question later. If you wanted to log out. I would think if you log back in and this screen came up, you would hit continue...

Tyler: But I'm sensing it's not totally clear. You might be like sort of guessing right?

> P9: Yeah, I mean, it's starting to save the progress. But hold on. Nope, it's you know it has the benefit that we're looking for already saved. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know if you can click on that part that says we saved your progress, and that would bring you back to where you were.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. Okay.

Tyler: cool. Well, let's continue onto the next page so i'll move us along.

Tyler: And now we're on this page, so tell me what you would click here.

> P9: Select the topic.

Tyler: Okay and talk to me what you're looking for right now.

> P9: Here's 911 GI Bill, chapter 33.

Tyler: Okay. Okay, cool. So I'll go ahead and click on that one unless you want to look at this list anymore.

> P9: No, we're good.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: awesome. So you found that pretty quickly. You kinda knew what you were looking for. And like, we said, you have a familiarity with Va programs. So.

> P9: I used the program for my 2 daughters.

Tyler: Okay, awesome. So I'll go ahead and click. Continue now

Tyler: and then. Tell me what we're seeing on this page.

> P9: Who you are, and I would be the Veteran.

Tyler: Is there ever a scenario where you would be a family member, or connected to the Veteran through work?

> P9: Back when I used it, it was just starting, the post 9 11, so you had to call the Buffalo Office Education Office. There was none of this. We're talking early. 2015. A lot of these apps weren't around.

Tyler: Cool. That makes sense.

Tyler: Alright. Well, I'll go ahead and continue on to the next page.

Tyler: and in the scenario we're imagining that you're trying to figure out whether you're eligible for, but for Gi. Bill benefits. So what would you say for this question?

> P9: I would say yes, because I wouldn't be asking if I didn't know. I'd have researched before. So I know if the people I'm asking the questions to are lying to me.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. So you already would have been like, I think I'm eligible for this. I've done a bunch of research myself. So I'm gonna tell you. Yes, for this.

Tyler: That makes sense. Okay, so ignore me, cause the prototype wants us to choose. No, but I hear you that you would choose. Yes, and I can totally see why.

Tyler: So I'll continue onto this page. And then here. I'm not going to be able to click on everything on this page. But just describe to me what you would do here.

> P9: Well where your schools located, and then the Residency State, because the Residency State determines what your housing allowances when you're residents of your home of record and the zip code. That's how they figure out. You know, what they pay for the housing.

Tyler: Gotcha. Okay. So this has to do with housing allowance?

> P9: Yep. The school state, it doesn't really matter. It's more that... the most important thing I mean, it says required, you know, for both information, but the residency is the most important part.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So from your experience, you understand that the Residency would be actually more important are both the School and Residency States required.

> P9: Yes.

Tyler: Okay.

Tyler: cool. So we'll pretend, like you put in your school and residency state. Okay. And then I'll click. Continue.

Tyler: Okay, so describe this page to me. What would you do here.

> P9: So it's kind of like an email. Your subject. You know what you're what you're inquiring about. And then write the information needed. For what you need the answer to. And then, if you have, say you have a certification file from the school, from the Certifying Officer School, the Veteran service certifying Officer. You have it. You can upload it there so that they can see what you know, what's being involved and what's everything that's going on.

Tyler: Okay. So you said, it looks kind of like an email and you're talking about and like your understanding of school certifying officials and what you might put in on this page. That makes sense.

Tyler: Are you required to upload a file?

> P9: No.

Tyler: Okay. Cool. So we'll pretend, like you put in that information here, kind of the way you described it to me. And then I'm gonna click. Continue. Okay.

> P9: Yes, ma'am.

Tyler: Alright. And now we're on this page. And so here we see some information in here. It says, Hector. We're gonna imagine it, says [P9], and this is all of your information. Okay, why is this information filled in already?

> P9: Because we use the login gov or id me. So it knows who I am.

Tyler: Okay. So you signed in. So that's how it knows who you are.

Tyler: And why are we showing you this information?

> P9: Because the system, or the person that's, you know, receiving the question wants to know who it's being directed back to.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense.

Tyler: is there anything else on this page that stands out at you?

> P9: Well, social security number, date of birth, and you know all the pertinent information to let... to verify that it's you. It's not somebody else filling in. We're trying to get information about you.

Tyler: Right. Okay. So they wanna make sure that you are who you say you are.

Tyler: Well, let's say, you reviewed this, and you were like this looks right. I'm gonna keep going. So I'll click Continue.

> P9: Yes, ma'am.

Tyler: And now we're on this page. And similarly, let's pretend like, this is your phone and email. What if you realize your phone number was wrong? Let's say you got a new phone number and you needed to change it. This was the wrong one. Can you tell me what you would do here?

> P9: You would highlight that box, and just, you know, enter your new information.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So you would just edit it on this page that makes sense, and if you did that so you changed your phone number here on this page. Would your phone number update anywhere else for the VA?

> P9: No, you have to actually, you have to go into either the enrollment center or go to VA.gov and update your personal information.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So you've gotta go to somewhere else to actually update your information. Yeah, that makes sense.

> P9: Yeah va.gov personal information.

Tyler: Okay. Gotcha.

Tyler: yeah, that makes sense. What if there was like a link on this page? And it said, You know, you can go update your personal information in your va.gov profile right now, would you? You know, thinking realistically, let's say I'm not here. Would you click on that link to do that right now?

> P9: Yes, if there was a change that affected how they get in touch with me. Either through text phone calls or emails. Yes.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So you'd want to make sure, it was updated for sure, and...

> P9: Yeah, I want the most update information, so that if the VA needs to get in touch with me, they can.

Tyler: That makes sense. And would you feel comfortable leaving this form halfway through to go change, your phone number in your VA.gov profile?

> P9: Yeah, because it saves it.

Tyler: Okay, cool. That makes sense. So let's pretend, like you did that you're back here at this page, your phone numbers updated. And then we're gonna click, continue

Tyler: and tell me about this page.

> P9: It's the reason I'm contacting you. You know compliments, complaints, suggestions, a town hall, you know, if you're attending a town hall with the VA secretary â which he just had one I think a week ago.

> P9: And allows you to submit questions. And while you're on the Town Hall, your question comes up. You know it may be something that will benefit another Veteran that you know, that didn't want to ask or didn't know how to ask.

Tyler: okay, cool. So you can kind of see a reason for these different options? And why, why do you think the VA is asking you this question.

> P9: They want to improve their system. You know, you talk to Vietnam guys. They hate the BS. A lot of them are coming back around. I'm fortunate. I'm a post 11 Gulf War Vet, and the system has dramatically improved over, you know, over to time. I mean, I know for myself the care I get it would equal anything. I would get out, and you know, in the in the community.

> P9: So, you know, they're always trying to improve. You know, I also understand that it's a government agency, and it takes a lot to get the improvements passed.

Tyler: that makes sense. So you're seeing this question as like the Va trying to collect information so that they can try and improve things that aren't working well.

> P9: Yup, you know. Complaints, compliments.

> P9: You know I know myself when I you know I get a lot of blood work done because of one of my conditions and... I always compliment the you know the phlebotomist, you know, if I don't feel the needle. That's an acquired art, you know, and it's. Yeah, it can, you know, be a pain in the ass if it you know. If they don't know what they're doing.

Tyler: Totally.

Tyler: I always find phlebotomist the craziest word.

Tyler: cool. So we talked a little bit about this page, and in this scenario what would you choose? What would be your answer?

> P9: Since we started off with, I have a question. You know, I had a question.

Tyler: Okay, cool.

Tyler: I'll click on continue now and then describe this page to me.

> P9: In the dropdown it would show what questions I have and then my information it allows me to review before I hit the submit button.

Tyler: That makes sense. And do you think you would review your personal information here?

> P9: Yes, I always did it. I always review even with secure messages. I reread them.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So you always wanna double check before you kind of send something off.

> P9: Yes ma'am.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So we'll say that you checked everything here. It was looking good. And then we're going to submit your question.

Tyler: Okay? And then I'll give you a minute to read this page and tell me what you're learning from this page.

> P9: you have a reference number. You'll receive an email confirmation, probably with the same reference number.

> P9: And then it says you should receive a reply by email within 7 business days.

> P9: If they need more information about the question. If it wasn't, you know, very clear, then they're gonna contact you.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

Tyler: So at the beginning, when we were talking about this early on, you kind of said secure messaging, and your experience tends to be like 24Â h turnaround, or maybe a little bit sooner.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: And you kind of thought that this might be similar. But now it's telling you it's within 7 business days. Is that surprising to you? Is that different than you expected?

> P9: No, I mean, if it's a question that you don't need... Secure Messaging is different, because you're dealing with your medical team. And you know, if you're asking something about your health, I would expect a quicker answer.

> P9: But benefits and stuff like that they may have to do research. They may have to go into your service record file to see if you're eligible. And there's a lot of lot of information they have to look at for where they answer your question.

> P9: It's kind of the same, you know, with the disability benefit side. There's a lot of stuff, you know, the rater has to look into before they actually see if they can service connect a disability.

Tyler: Right. Okay, yeah, that makes sense. So you're kind of seeing that although there are similarities between secure messaging and something like this, there's also pretty different use cases. In one case it's about your healthcare. They know who you are, and in another case they're having to look through files, and it's a little bit more of a process.

> P9: Yes.

Tyler: Yeah, that that makes a lot of sense to me.

### Cool down

Tyler: I'm gonna close this page now, because we've actually reached the end of our prototype, and we'll just spend the next couple of minutes just kind of reflecting.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So another thing I remember is that at the beginning you kinda thought you might click on something, and you might be able to put in your question and send it to the VA.

Tyler: And this process was a little bit different, right? There was a lot of pages that we went through. So how do you feel about that now? Having gone through it.

> P9: It's I mean, it's kind of the same thing. They're going to need information from you. It just can't be a system. If you're asking a particular question about all the subjects that they have in that dropdown. Yeah, they're gonna need some background information.

> P9: Like I said, that you know I spoke with the secure messaging that to me is a different system than this.

> P9: Whereas you're most likely asking something more detailed. Whereas, you know, on the secure messaging side, it's the health side. And yeah, I would expect that my doctor or my nurse would get back to me within 24 to 48Â h. Question about my health.

> P9: But [if] I ask a question about something that the VA is offering. Yes, it's gonna take time.

Tyler: Right? Okay, so you have like a pretty you have realistic understanding. About like why, why, it might take a little bit longer in this case.

> P9: I've been dealing with the VA since 2016, and I have stood back and learned how to navigate the system to my benefit.

Tyler: Yeah, what's like, some advice that you would give a new Veteran in terms of navigating the system.

> P9: Don't get frustrated. You're dealing with a government entity. It's not gonna be instant and educate yourself.

> P9: I mean, I belong to some Veterans Facebook groups about disabilities and benefits. And, you know, the vague question is, well, what do I have to do to do this, without giving us any details. You know we can't answer your question as subject matter experts. If you don't provide us with the details, we need to give you the information to figure your answer your question.

Tyler: Yeah.

Tyler: yeah, I love that perspective.

> P9: Anything you want to do, you have to educate yourself. And now, in the time of Google, there's no reason for anybody not to know what to do. Like, I said. I'm the kind of person I like to do my research, so that if I'm asking a question I already know the answer. Least I have some semblance of the answer. And I want to know how well you know your job.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P9: That's all I expect you know, at like.

> P9: I'm a government worker, you know. I work for the army, and I deal with soldiers all day.

> P9: I have a job where they expect a certain thing, and I have to get these guys where they need to be at certain times, and there's no fail. You know. There's no fail. There has to happen. So I have. I have to ask a lot of questions. And a lot of times. A lot of the units I deal with don't have the answers. Or they just don't think, you know. Oh, well, I didn't know you needed that. Well. You know it's how well prepared you are.

> P9: And I tell people that are new to the VA system, you know I have conversations in the hospital, and you know when I when I go to my VA meetings and everything. And I tell them, it's a frustrating system, if you let it frustrate you. But it's a system that if you know how to navigate it and educate yourself, it's a great system.

> P9: I've had nothing but great doctors and care. I always compliment, you know. And you know I I've never had to go to the patient advocate. I've never had a file complaint. If I didn't like my care, I would find a way to get what I needed or get the answer I needed.

Tyler: yeah, I mean, I can tell, just from chatting with you for less than an hour that you're obviously quite proactive, in how you approach these things and and have a pretty good understanding of a lot of how the Va works, which can be can seem very complicated definitely at first.

Tyler: so that makes a lot of sense to me.

Tyler: Thinking about this process just now, is there anything that could have been easier for someone like you, or is there anything you would change?

> P9: For me. No. This is good for me.

> P9: I like you said to explain how things work and how you can find answers.

> P9: Yes, it would benefit a newer person to the VA. Even a person that's been in the VA only 1 or 2 years, and really doesn't understand how it works.

> P9: You know what you need to do on your part. And you know, to help the people in the benefits department. The people in the healthcare. It's a 2 way street.

> P9: And you know, I tell guys, when I help them out with claims. It's your claim. Own it. It's your healthcare. Own it.

> P9: And that's you have to take that attitude, and if you don't like the answer you got, then you need to find out how you can get the answer that you know you should have gotten, or if you feel you've been neglected. Or you know, haven't gotten the care. Think you should be getting.  There's a lot of people complain about the Va. But you know it's an outstanding system.

> P9: It's one of the largest teaching. It's it is the largest teaching systems in the United States. For doctors, nurses, and and you know, just and research, too.

> P9: You know, there's a lot of research that comes out of the Va. And Veterans, when the 1 million Veterans thing came up to  give, you know, give a little blood, and to allow universities to do studies. And, and, you know, advanced technologies. For you know, Ptsd and and TBI, and you know I jumped right on it. If it can help another Veteran, why not? It's a tube of blood.

> P9: Anytime I have an opportunity or the VA asks me to do something, I try to do it because it gives back to other Veterans, and it also will benefit me.

Tyler: well, that's awesome. You sound like a great a great member of the community and i'm, glad you've figured out, a good way to navigate the system, and that it is working well for you. I think that's obviously what we'd hope for everybody. So I like to hear that.

> P9: I'm sure there's a lot of people pissed off at the VA.

Tyler: Yeah, there's there's a couple...

Tyler: So I see we've got like a couple of minutes left before a session ends. There was one more thing I just wanted to ask you about before we wrap up. So I kinda wanna talk about how long the process felt. We just touched on it a little bit, and that like, yeah, maybe it was a bit longer than you thought it was going to be. But you understood why it was asking you for certain things. While you were filling out the form, did you feel like you had a sense of how much longer you had left?

> P9: Yeah. I mean. When you navigate web systems like that and web forms you, you know what's coming and what. And when you're getting close to the end.

> P9: You know, if it wasn't part of this study I could, I could could have probably gotten through that in less than you know 3 or 4Â min.

Tyler: Yep.

> P9: Yeah, I mean, you know, it's you know, some people may take longer. Because, like I said, they, you know, they don't embrace the technology. It all depends. You know, how you how you feel about. I think it's you know it's a great. It would be a great, you know. It's a great web, you know, app.

> P9: A lot of people it would allow you to, you know, gain information.

Tyler: Awesome. Well, that's really helpful. I think that makes sense. You obviously have experience like filling out other forms or contacting companies or organizations. So this felt like kind of straightforward for you, and you sort of knew a little bit what to expect the whole time, which is which is good.

> P9: Little bit easier.

Tyler: I think that's all my questions for you. So I did want to give you a couple of minutes in case you had any questions for me. It might be about like what we're doing with this research or about this tool, or whatever.

> P9: Well, it's I mean I would think it's to improve it. If people you know say, Oh, you know I have that app, but it's tough for me to navigate. You need to change this, and. You know, the 3 people in the back that, you know are the people that work the you know, the technical side of it. You know they want to hear answers, too. So.

Tyler: yeah, yeah, exactly. Well so Ask VA exists right now but, it's on a different website and we're moving it to VA to make it a little easier for Veterans to access it. And while we're doing that we're testing it with a bunch of Veterans to understand kind of what could be easier. I think you probably had an easier time than a lot of other folks who we've seen go through the process. Which is understandable. And that's why we talked to a lot of different people.

Tyler: and one of the things we were looking at specifically today was whether there was a need throughout the form for you to understand how much longer it was gonna take. And I got the sense that that really wasn't impacting you and your experience of using it.

Tyler: so yeah, that's kind of one of the big things we were looking at, but lots of little things, too, and you helped us answer a lot of questions there. So.

> P9: Okay. I'm glad I could help.

Tyler: Awesome. Well, that's the rest of the session. So thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate it. I know it was a little tricky getting set up, and I appreciate your patience. The folks who set up this research session. They're gonna send you a thank you. Note they'll give you some information if you wanna pass it on to other Veterans who want to participate in research like this. And if you have questions you can reach out to them.

Tyler: But I hope you have a lovely rest of your day.

> P9: Yeah, you gotta you know. The motto of the military is Semper Gumby.

> P9: You know always flexible.

> P9: I realize that today, trying to, you know, the multiple platforms to try and log on. So.

Tyler: Yeah. Well, I appreciate that

Tyler: awesome. Well, take care, [P9].

> P9: Yup, you have a great day, ma'am.

Tyler: You too, bye.

> P9: Yeah, bye, bye.
