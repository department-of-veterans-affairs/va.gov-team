### Warm up

Tyler: Okay. So I started the recording. And I just want to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio today?

> P1: Yes.

Tyler: Okay, awesome. Do you have any questions for me at this point.

> P1: No, I, Tyler, I know you're being very sensitive. Don't worry about all that stuff. Let's just. I mean, it's good. I'm sure the people who kind of get upset, or whatever I understand the point of this. So and I'm sure you have your script you have to follow. But don't worry about me and trauma and overreacting, or anything like that. So.

Tyler: Okay, well, you can react, however, you feel like reacting.

> P1: I appreciate that.

Tyler: So before we get started looking at the prototype. I guess I'd like to learn a little bit more about your experience with the VA. How long have you been a Veteran?

> P1: So I retired from the army after 22 years in 2013. So what's that? That makes 11 years? I. So I guess I approach the VA From a couple of different angles. One is as a Veteran, but because I'm retired, most of my health care comes from insurance, from TriCare.

> P1: So I actually don't deal that much with the VA. For my healthcare. So that's kind of the personal side. The professional side is, I'm in the Veteran space. So I have a lot of contact with Va, I hear a lot about Va. I hear a lot about Veterans and what they say about VA. But I'm very clear that this is about my personal experience with VA, and actually, in my experience. My interaction with VA is kind of increased a little bit recently because of PACT act and a couple and a couple of other things. So.

Tyler: Okay, well, that's awesome. Yeah. I think I'm really curious to hear your experience first and foremost. But if there's things that come up like from your experience in your work. You're welcome to share those as well. So it sounds like you've been kind of interacting with the VA for a while. Did you get in touch, or get set up with the VA right when you became a Veteran, or after a few years?

> P1: So, yes, but again, because so that was for my disability rating. But because I get all my health care through. So I have a 0% disability rating. So none of my, none of my health issues are actually – what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to figure out whether I can make one of my current conditions connectable to my time. But, currently, as I said, my healthcare doesn't come from the from the VA.

> P1: So I don't. So yes, initially. And then, after that, it's been very kind of minimal until probably the last few months. So.

Tyler: Okay, yeah, that makes sense. Have you contacted the VA before?

> P1: Yes, some. I mean, online, snail mail, phone calls. So kind of all the all the various interactions that I can have with the VA. I think. Online, you know, visiting websites and such.

Tyler: Yeah, okay, so a lot of your online interactions tend to be like reading through information online versus, like, maybe chatting with the VA online.

> P1: Correct. I think I've maybe chatted online once or twice.

> P1: But most of my interaction is just is, there's a link. I go to it and try to do some research, or try to log in, or or whatever.

Tyler: Okay, awesome.

### Homepage to sign in 

Tyler: Well, that's super helpful. What? We're gonna do now, is i'm, gonna share you share with you a prototype. So how we'll do this is I'll send you a link in the chat on zoom and then if you can open this link on your screen. It might take a second to load. But let me know how that's working for you.

> P1: Okay. Yup, I got Ask VA prototype R2. Yup, I'm there.

Tyler: Okay, awesome. So have you shared your screen on zoom before?

> P1: Yes. Hold on a second.

Tyler: Okay. Just let me know if you want a reminder.

> P1: Don't be don't be alarmed by my gazillion tabs.

Tyler: Oh, gosh! That does always alarm me, but I'll give you a break.

> P1: Let's see, I'm trying to figure out.

Tyler: So if you're back at zoom, if you kind of scroll, yeah, I see I'm starting to see it perfect. Okay? So now I can see what you're seeing. And it looks like it says, Ask VA. That's perfect.

Tyler: So we're not gonna click on anything yet. But I'm gonna give you a moment to look at this page. Feel free to scroll if you want to, and I'd love for you to tell me what you're noticing first.

> P1: My first reaction is, it seems, text heavy. I see a lot of writing, or, you know a lot of a lot of text.

> P1: So that's the I think that's the big thing I noticed. Not that I have a problem reading. But in my mind, imagery, or something like that, might be helpful.

Tyler: Yeah, that's helpful to know.

> P1: And then. Well, so I'm always logging into VA either Login gov or ID me. And this is probably not, it's not always a traumatic experience, but it's complicated.

> P1: Hopefully, I'm on my own computer. So it remembers. But there are times like my last interaction. I didn't. I didn't copy the key code and so I had to go through that process again. And you know, this time I saved it. And I understand the security requirements, but that logging in is a little bit of a pain.

Tyler: Yeah. I do hear that a lot. And so when you look at this page, what's your reaction to like seeing the sign in immediately, like, obviously it made you first think, oh, sign in is a little bit of a pain...

> P1: So I'm used to it now the sign in or create an account. I'm used to that and I like that that it's... it to me it seems like it's kind of the standard boilerplate that I'm that I've seen on other websites. So that's not new. And I kind of like that. I just the web page itself. It's not very inspiring, I guess.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense.

Tyler: What do you feel like this page is about?

> P1: I gotta sign in to ask you questions. Essentially.

> P1: Which you know. That's an interesting point from my perspective of why do I have to sign in to ask you a question. Why? Why can't I ask the what? Why do I have to be completely kind of integrated into the system? To ask a simple question. My question might take me 10 seconds. But the login is probably gonna take me 30 seconds or longer.

> P1: Just to ask a question that maybe is very easily answerable or already exists. So why do I have to sign in to do that?

Tyler: Right. That's really helpful. And when you say, like, you know, my question might take me 10 seconds. Do you feel like you're gonna get an answer from the VA right away, like you're gonna type your question, you're gonna get an answer. How are you expecting it to work?

> P1: Since I haven't done the chat before. Well, there isn't even, I mean, as I scroll through here, there's not even a chat.

> P1: Let's see, either. I'll have to. So this is me, either. I'll have to do some pretty serious research to get an answer to my question, or it'll take me a little bit, and when I say a little bit I don't expect an immediate answer. Maybe later that day. It might be the next day. But I don't think I ever expect an immediate answer.

Tyler: Okay, gotcha. If it's not immediate, how are you going to get the answer? What's your guess?

> P1: Well, I suppose I it depends on... So let me let me back up.

> P1: I don't think I've ever asked a question. And now that I think about it, I'm not sure I've ever seen a forum where I can ask a question out of the blue. It's either a specific VA contact, I have, and other people may not have that. Or I got to do my own research. I can't, I actually can't think of a forum where I can ask a question and expect either an immediate answer, or even an answer directly to me via email. 

> P1: I can't think, I don't... I haven't looked for that, but it's certainly not easy to ask a question and expect a quick answer.

> P1: From my, obviously, I'm talking from my perspective.

Tyler: Right. No, but that's really helpful, like your experience has been, you would have like a direct contact to someone at the VA that you could get in touch with. Otherwise it's you doing your own research.

> P1: Yes, and I would also say crowdsourcing it. So, not even asking the VA. Asking other Veterans or other Veteran service organizations. Like, what do you know about this?

> P1: And I mean – I guess this is the point of this whole thing is – I think it would be helpful to VA if you could ask a question. And maybe it's AI. Maybe there's some AI to it. Or, or, again, maybe an online crowd sourced kind of thing.

> P1: I think I've gone to frequently asked questions. FAQs on pages. But I think I've been pretty frustrated by that in the past that it that it's not particularly. I've never gotten the impression that anybody's really sat down and gone through frequently asked questions and put them in, and you. I'm not sure I've ever seen a situation where the VA has said, you know what we get this question a lot and here's the answer. I don't think I've seen that.

Tyler: Right.

> P1: And I mean, to be honest, I'm not even sure.  I don't even know if that's kind of in the mindset of the VA. Because – and the reason I say that is, I've been through plenty of briefings about the PACT act. But they never adjust the briefings to say, you know, here's a question we get a lot, and we're gonna preempt that by saying, by answering it. That's a very broad statement, but I don't know if that's in the VA kind of culture to gather that information, preempt it, and put it out there before anyone even asks it.

Tyler: Yeah, that's super helpful to hear about all of your experience, and how it's leading you to expect certain things about your future interaction with the VA.

Tyler: So for the rest of our conversation today, what we're gonna do is pretend, like you need to ask the VA a question. So we're gonna say that you'd like to learn whether you're eligible for Post 9/11 GI bill benefits. Okay. Are you familiar with the GI bill?

> P1: Yes, yup!

Tyler: Okay, great. So just as a reminder for everybody on the call, the Post 9/11 GI bill helps you pay for school or job training. So people who have served on active duty after September tenth 2001 might qualify for these benefits. So what we're doing today is, we're gonna imagine that you'd like to know if you can qualify for them.

> P1: Ok.

Tyler: And so I'll remind you of this as we go along.

Tyler: But without clicking anything yet can you tell me what you do first in this scenario to ask the VA your question.

> P1: Hmm. I probably go to Google and ask, How do I know if I... I would probably say I'm a Veteran. Am I qualified for post 9/11 GI Bill benefits. That's probably what I would ask. And then I'd have to sort through whatever the responses were.

Tyler: Okay. That makes sense.

Tyler: And so let's say that you ended up on this web page that we're looking at together.

> P1: Okay.

Tyler: So we're here. Maybe your friend, who's a Veteran, had said, why don't you try Ask VA? Why don't you try and ask them your question to find out if you're eligible. So you're looking at this page. And you're like, Okay, where do I begin?

Tyler: Can you show me where you would click first on this page.

> P1: So I would... I would probably hit VA benefits and healthcare.

Tyler: Okay, you'd probably go up to yeah...

> P1: And see what the what the dropdown menu would give me. There.

Tyler: What is this page? What we're scrolling around looking at right now, what is this about? You mentioned that it was to ask the VA a question.

> P1: I think what I'm doing is... What is the fastest... I'm trying to... I'm going through my mind what's the fastest way for me to find the answer to this question? And can I do it by myself? So that's why I go to the menu with VA benefits and healthcare. And maybe there's a 9 11 tab, you know. A GI Bill tab.

> P1: I mean, I don't think it's functional, right? It doesn't look like.

Tyler: Yeah, we won't be able to click on that. Yeah.

> P1: So, okay, so let's assume that would be my first option. I think. And then I'm looking for an option to simply type it in, like a little bit of an FAQ kind of thing.

Tyler: Kind of like a search?

> P1: Sort of. I guess either either a chat function or something that allows me to ask my question quickly without having to sign in.

> P1: I don't see... I don't need to get to the Veterans Crisis line. And then there is this but – I will tell you. I think my experience here is, I had to kind of search for that. So like the chat bot. So my initial reaction is, I'm not going to give you guys a call because I'm going to be on the phone forever. That's kind of my initial thought. I don't mind the chat bot, but make that easy for me. There's no I mean, maybe this could be a link right here. The chat bot.

> P1: And I'd be willing to experiment with [the chatbot]. Is it going to give me the answer I want?

> P1: But I think in my mind I would want that to be kind of an obvious in fact.

> P1: If I can ask my question without doing the sign in – the the nice thing about a chat bot is, I can type my question in, and then I can go do something else and monitor the chat bot.

> P1: There's no chat bot then, jeez now I got to spend time signing in, and then what's going to be on the other side of that, is kind of the way I'm thinking about this.

Tyler: Totally, okay. That's really helpful. So like you mentioned quite a few things like you're thinking about. What's the fastest way for me to do this. I don't wanna have to wait on the phone. If you're gonna offer different ways for me to do this, I want it to be linked and to be easy for me. It's taking a while to find those things, and also it feels like right now, your only option is to sign in.

> P1: Yeah, that's what it looks like. I mean, from... Although there there is a continue without signing in. But I mean, I just noticed that just now. Yeah.

Tyler: Why do you think that's less noticeable? Is there a reason why that might be less noticeable than the sign in.

> P1: Well, the sign in is a big blue box. And this is a this is a familiar to me. This feels like I've seen this before, right? This is on. This probably is on current web pages. I mean, that's what it feels like.

> P1: The continue without signing in to me is, it's clearly not an option that you want me to take, because it's pretty pretty minor.

Tyler: Right. That makes sense. And why do you think, is there anything on this page, or anything in this text that's saying it's telling you why that might be. Why does it seem like the VA wants you to sign in?

> P1: Well, it's the biggest to me. It's got the big blue box. It's got the link that takes me there. And again I think there's familiarity with it. The login.gov the id me the Ds log all that terminology. That seems like it was copied and pasted from current web pages. So I'm familiar with that. I've seen it.

Tyler: Right, yeah. That makes sense. So it's more obvious. It's familiar. Is there a reason that the VA wants it to be more obvious? Why do they want you to sign in?

> P1: Because, I mean, my interpretation. And I think this is pretty accurate is, the VA is trying to get people to sign in. They're trying to get people to enroll in VA benefits. So signing in gives them your information. And now now they have a name and a contact to be able to reach out to you. So they want your information. Because their ultimate goal is to make sure that you're enrolled and that you take advantage of VA benefits and healthcare.

Tyler: Okay, Gotcha, that's really helpful. So let's move ourselves along. And we're gonna pretend, like, you know, you're asking the VA this question about whether you're eligible for for education benefits, and it sounds like you... I'm getting the sense you'd prefer not to sign in if that was the option. So why don't we click on Continue without signing in?

Tyler: And now we're on this page. So we're still in this scenario. So why don't you show me what you would do on this page if you had your question about education benefits.

> P1: My first reaction to this is, Oh my God! I'm only 5% complete with this process. I don't like that. It it feels to me like holy shit. I have a long way to go to get the answer to this question.

Tyler: You saw that right away.

> P1: Right away. I mean, it's in orange. And I don't, I mean, maybe this is my personality. But I think Veterans, you know, we're kind of action oriented and kind of task oriented to a certain extent. And so when you tell me that all I wanna do is ask a question, and I'm only 5% complete is kind of my response is what the hell. I mean, what else do I have... What are the gazillion things I have to do before I get my answer? My question answered.

Tyler: Totally. So it already seems like, okay, this is a bigger thing that I expected. You notice the 5% complete. And you're like, okay, this is totally not what I was thinking I was gonna be getting myself into.

> P1: You know what it? I think I get why it's 5 complete, because there's a whole bunch of stuff behind it. But my gut reaction is don't tell me that before. All I did was click a button. All I want to do is ask a question. And it looks like this is going to be a big, long drawn out process. That's the impression that bar gives, I mean. And it's even visual, right? It says, 5% complete. And then there's this long bar that's only a little bit complete. Maybe I'm fixating on this. But.

Tyler: No, but that makes sense.

> P1: I feel like I have a long way to go to.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

Tyler: So let's go ahead and push through. We'll choose a category. So which category would you choose?

> P1: So, I mean, I'll double check. Well, my, I for some reason I can't scroll further.

Tyler: Yeah, the scrolls a little funny. If you take your mouse to the side, then you'll be able to scroll. Yeah, and that's just because it's a prototype.

> P1: Oh, yeah. Got it. So all I'm doing is I mean, it looks like my answers right here up at the top. But because it says and work study – all I was doing was saying, is there anything that just focuses on education? Is there another category that is more specific to me.

> P1: So I'm gonna click on that.

Tyler: Okay, that really helpful. Okay, well, let's click continue. So we'll say, education benefits. And then tell me what we're seeing next.

> P1: So. I think this is not unusual. I think this is kind of a VA thing. On the first page, you asked me to sign in. I didn't want to sign in. It says Continue without signing in. So I click that. It takes me here and now I have to sign in, so I feel like it was a little bit of trickery going on here. I'm trying to be funny, but, VA you said, Hey, you can get your answer. You can get an answer without signing in. Okay. And I bit. I said, okay, let's do it. And now I have to sign in.

Tyler: Right. So it's like, they told you you didn't have to sign in. And now they're telling you you ou do have to sign in, and it feels a little bit like, you said, trickery.

> P1: Trickery, I mean, that's too strong a word. But a little bit of, I don't know. I'm trying to. I was like I knew it. I knew I had to sign in, it just it was just a matter of time. I guess that is kind of what I'm saying to myself.

Tyler: Yeah, okay, that makes sense. And especially in the context of like, you're on a VA website, because you said, this is kind of a thing the VA does.

> P1: I think it's happened before, like I get that. I certainly this. This is not. You feel like you're going down a pathway that I thought was gonna be relatively easy. And then but it's not. It's, I still have to sign in. The thing I was trying to avoid, I still have to do. Yeah, okay.

Tyler: That's really helpful. And I can totally see how that's frustrating and a little bit misleading and also familiar. So let's go ahead and click on sign in. We'll say, Okay, fine. I have to sign in. We're not actually gonna sign in today. We're just gonna pretend like we're signing in. But does this screen look familiar to you? You said, Oh, boy.

> P1: Oh boy.

> P1: Yeah. So again, I not that signing in is traumatic, but it's a pain to sign in. I feel like. Here's what I feel. Am I going to get it right? Or am I gonna have to... So I forgot my password and all that kind of stuff. This is a little bit stressful for me. And I mean I must sound like I don't know. It's just there's this, this looks familiar. I've seen it all before, but it's still an oh, boy, here we go again, do I have my credentials, right? I'm gonna have to go to my phone, look up what my login is. If my computer doesn't remember and I'm gonna have to go to my phone and I don't know. It's just not something I'm looking forward to.

Tyler: That makes a lot of sense. I totally understand. Lucky for you in this session you don't actually have to sign in. So what we'll do is we're imagining you're doing all of that. Hopefully, you remember your username and password. Hopefully, it all works out so we'll click on Login.Gov. 

Tyler: We'll pretend like we did all of that. Now we're signed in. Okay, okay, so tell me what we're looking at now.

### Through to submission

> P1: My initial reaction is this is not particularly friendly. I would rather... I think there's a way to encourage somebody to ask their question. You know what, actually, what this whole process feels like is... And I'm. VA is saying alright, we gotta answer people's questions. So here's the process for doing it. Get your login information. But yeah, we know you wanna ask a question.

> P1: [Whereas] I think the attitude [should be], hey, we wanna answer your question! We wanna make it as easy as possible! We love it when you ask questions because we wanna help you! That's kind of the attitude that I think VA should have. Is be much more on the on the customer service side. This feels like, again, Oh, boy, we gotta help another guy.

Tyler: Yeah, totally. So you don't feel necessarily encouraged.

Tyler: What do you think would be more encouraging. Is it just the words that the VA uses, or what can you imagine?

> P1: Oh, boy! I mean for me. If somebody said, great! You made it through login. That's a little... But a situation of.. Even something like great! Exclamation point exclamation point. We want to answer your question! What is it? Or something like that some kind of, I don't know it of feel good. You know. We're happy you made it here. We want to answer your question. Kind of that.

> P1: The attitude needs to be a little bit more positive and a little bit more welcoming. This is very bureaucratic, I mean very, very VA. Old school VA.

> P1: Alright. Ask your question. Kind of thing. That's the impression.

Tyler: Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense the like the tone of the message...

> P1: There is no tone. This is totally monotone.

Tyler: Right.

> P1: Like. I mean, it's black and white. I mean, it's not a whole lot of writing. It's very monotonic and not very encouraging. I guess.

Tyler: Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense. You're the first person we're showing this page, too. So that's really helpful for us to learn about that perspective.

Tyler: So we're gonna click on Ask a new question. We're gonna say, you're gonna continue, despite the discouragement. And now we're looking at this screen. And so tell me what we're seeing here.

> P1: Again the progress bar. So here's the thing. And I think this is significant. So I before I signed in, I was at 5%. Then you told me I had to sign, in which I found kind of annoying. As we talked about. I signed in. I clicked something, and I'm still at 5%. I haven't moved. Yeah. So I mean, encourage me. You're 10 or you're 50.

> P1: Again, this is very bureaucratic, very black and white. Where you know the numbers are the numbers right? Very mathematical rather than kind of emotional. I suppose.

Tyler: Yeah, so you're feeling like, page after page, a little bit like the VA doesn't really want you to be here.

> P1: Yeah, yeah. So let's see, I did. How many clicks have I done? I've done, I continue to ask question. So that's one. Well. I did the dropdown menu. But let's not. Let's not do that. So continue to ask a question. Then I clicked again. What I've this is, I've probably clicked on something 4 times. And I logged in. This keystroke and a little bit of pain. And I'm still only 5.

Tyler: Right. Yeah, I hear you. And is this a question you've already answered? Or is this a new question.

> P1: Wait, say that again. Sorry.

Tyler: Yeah. Is this a question that you've already answered? Or is this a new question?

> P1: This is a new question.

> P1: Well, so, okay, so so here's the thing.

> P1: I don't know if we're going to get to this, but here's what I notice, and right off the bat is, I already did this step.

> P1: I already told you what I wanted to know about. And you said, okay, sign in. Which I thought I wouldn't have to do, because I clicked on the continue without signing in.

> P1: So I signed in. I did what you wanted me to do. And now I'm clicking on this. And I haven't made any forward progress. I'm back where I was 2 pages ago is my reaction to this.

Tyler: Yeah, which is super understandable.

Tyler: So it feels a little bit like, what would have been better, given your experience just now, is that the VA just told you you have to sign in in order to use this.

> P1: Yeah, yeah, I think there's 2. There's 2 functions. One is. You told me I had to sign in. You know what, which I kind of get. I get that. But you didn't remember what I asked you before. And to me. This is an expansion of the, okay, we really, I have to do this because, you know, somebody's telling us we have to do it, not because I want to.

> P1: It's similar to the experience. When I'm sure you've experienced this when you get on. You're out of, you know you do the automated phone thing. Give all your information, and then you get with a live person, and you have to give the same information again that you did on the keypad. This is like that.

Tyler: Totally.

> P1: Then, why did I just do that then? Why did I just give you that information?

Tyler: Yeah.

> P1: Ask it of me again.

Tyler: For sure. I think that makes a lot of sense.

Tyler: I can see how this is frustrating, so you'll have to forgive me, as we continue to push through.

> P1: No need to apologize. Yeah, we're working through this.

Tyler: We are for sure.

> P1: And I know I'm getting worked up about it. But it's all in good humor, because, and here's the thing, I think it's all in good humor, because this is nothing new from the VA. The humor. The humor in it, I think, is a way to deal with the little bit of the frustration about this.

Tyler: Yeah, I think that's a pretty apt reflection. And that makes a lot of sense.

Tyler: Well, let's click on education benefits. I'm gonna move us all along a little bit, so we'll click on this one and then we'll click, continue.

Tyler: And now we're on this page and just reminding you that we're checking if you're eligible for Post 9/11 GI Bill benefits. So can you show me what you would do on this page?

> P1: Well, so I would. I mean, it's pretty self-explanatory. So now I'm searching through this list.

Tyler: What are you looking for? What's sticking out?

> P1: Well, so I think, I mean, it's interesting that you ask that because...

> P1: I'm trying to figure out what I need from this dropdown menu. So my general category is, do I have education benefits? But I feel like I have to look at everything because there's no, there's no direct answer to my question in this dropdown list. So now I have to say, alright, what is it that I'm actually looking for? And I think it's that.

Tyler: Okay.

> P1: I guess the thing is, I'm not exactly... I guess I'm hoping that this is what I want. I'm hoping this. This is the category of stuff I want. I don't know for sure that that's what I want.

> P1: And to me actually something that might be kind of interesting is if I could hover over these. Like Montgomery GI Bill, I think is a specific time period. And so if I hovered over this, it would say, Hey, this is, you know there might be a little explanation of this applies to you.

> P1: But I'm kind of guessing.

> P1: I mean, even with my experience in the Veteran space and the fact that I am a Veteran. I'm kind of hoping that I'm clicking on the right thing to be honest.

Tyler: Yeah, I can totally see that there's a lot of options, and there's not a lot of description. And then also you mentioned – Oh, I don't think it'll let you open it again. I'm sorry.

> P1: Oh, that's interesting. Okay.

Tyler: That's only because it's a prototype. Normally, you would be able to.

Tyler: But yeah, it's helpful to hear that you feel like you're guessing, and you maybe kind of wish that you didn't have to guess. An it's just a lot more thinking than one might want to do.

> P1: Yeah. And this chapter 33. Like again, I'm in the Veterans space. I don't even really know what that means. So I think something to think about is, what are you gearing these choice? Who are you gearing these choices to? A Chapter 33 person, you know, somebody that understands that probably doesn't need to come to this web page. Somebody like me, like I don't know, Chapter 33, or what?

> P1: I suppose, think about, in my mind. I think something is. If you're coming to this web page. Who are you? And what is kind of your experience level. And by putting Post-9/11 GI and all those choices. I think there's an assumption that, hey? You know what you're looking for, when in fact, I'm not sure that I do.

Tyler: For sure. I think that's – you describe that really well, and I think it would be a common experience for a lot of people who are Veterans and they're not working at the VA or they don't know what Chapter 33 is.

Tyler: So let's click continue. I'm gonna move us along a little bit, just because I see the time.

> P1: Sorry.

Tyler: No, don't apologize. Everything you said has been really helpful.

Tyler: So why don't you go ahead and show me how you'd answer this page.

> P1: So I mean, I'd look at all those but I'm the Veteran, so.

Tyler: Okay, let's click continue.

Tyler: And then on this page. So we're imagining you're trying to figure out if you're eligible for GI Bill benefits. What would you do on this page?

> P1: My gut reaction is yes, but then I see the I'm not sure, and I'm like, hmm. I'm not sure that's part of the reason I'm here. So, and you saw me scroll down. I was like, is there anything else that can help me?

> P1: And I didn't. I didn't see that. I'm going to take a – so are you a Gi bill beneficiary? So this is interesting. As I'm thinking about this, does that mean that I've taken advantage of it or that I can take advantage of it?

> P1: I mean the wording on this is kind of funky. I'm not sure how to answer this, because beneficiary to me means I'm taking advantage of it. I am receiving the GI bill. Another meaning could be, I can potentially receive it. And then the third thing is, I don't know. I mean, that's the reason I'm here is I don't know if I'm a GI bill beneficiary.

> P1: I mean, I know I'm not receiving it, but I don't know if I could potentially receive it. So this is kind. It's a kind of confusing question.

Tyler: I can totally see that that's...

> P1: I'm gonna, but I'm gonna say yes, because. And I'm kind of guessing.

Tyler: Right.

Tyler: Yeah. Well, the prototype will help you out this time. But that's really helpful to hear how it was confusing. I completely understand, so we'll click no, but I think you would have clicked yes. And then we'll click continue.

Tyler: And then we're not going to click anything on this page. But can you just describe to me what you would do on this page?

Tyler: What's this question asking for?

> P1: So in my particular situation, I'm like whoa! I don't even know if I can go to school. So why are you asking me what state my school is in. I can answer, and this is really funny is the school state is required. So I am here to see. Can I even utilize GI Bill benefits? And you're asking me, where's the school you want to go to?

> P1: This residency state makes more sense. Not required.

> P1: So that's really to me, this is to me. This is kind of out of order.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. So you feel like you don't really have a school state if you're still trying to figure out if you're eligible, you're not in school.

> P1: Yeah, the question. The question I'm wondering is, am I even eligible? And you're kind of assuming that I am. That I've that I'm that I'm way ahead in the process than I actually am.

Tyler: Totally. Yeah.

Tyler: Okay, well, let's pretend like, you just kinda like, guess we're not actually gonna choose the school state or residency state. We can just click, continue, we'll pretend like we put that in. And now we're looking at this screen.

Tyler: And so we can't actually type in the in the box today. But tell me, what made you laugh a little bit?

> P1: To me, this should have been at the beginning of the process. So you made me jump through – the VA made me jump through some hoops, and I get it. They want to be able to put me in a box and get some data. But then, then there's this free text question. And to me, I don't know. That's a tough one. I think this is a little bit frustrating.

> P1: I guess my thought is, you were kind of teasing me by making me answer these questions, and I was a little bit confused, and I was, like, so I might come up with an answer. I might find out an answer, and then you say so, what's your question? And to me, that's. It's a little bit backwards.

Tyler: Yeah, okay.

> P1: I don't know what the order should be, because you still you still need to put me in some kind of niche or category.

> P1: And then select files to upload. I don't. What? What do you want me to upload? What do I need?

> P1: So I can understand why this is a... so to me. This is a this is kind of a boilerplate that the VA kind of puts everywhere. And they decided it to put here. But it's not very helpful.

Tyler: Right. Okay, that's really helpful. So it feels like it's out of order, although you're not exactly sure which order it should be in. And I understand why that is.

Tyler: And it's weird. It's asking for file upload that makes it kind of feel like generic. That's all really helpful.

Tyler: So just to move us along. We're gonna pretend like you had typed in your question. You probably didn't uploaded a file and we'll just click continue.

Tyler: And then on this page. We're gonna pretend like this is filled in with your information. So let's pretend like it, said [P1], instead of Hector, and so forth. So why is this information filled in already.

> P1: Because I signed in, I mean this does not surprise me that it's filled out. In fact, it's a little bit of confirmation. Okay, you know who I am. I signed in. You know who I am. So that's good.

> P1: This doesn't bother me.

> P1: Service number you know. I mean. My impression is service number is kind of Vietnam era, and before I don't know. Service number is I mean, my service number was always my social security number. 

> P1: So this doesn't bother me except for the service number. To me that seems kind of anachronistic or old.

Tyler: Right? It doesn't apply for you. Yeah, that makes sense. So we saw this because we signed in right, and that seemed like that was familiar for you. Does that like? Does that change your opinion about having signed in to ask your question?

> P1: No, but. The thing that just popped into my mind is this would have been good after I signed in. So I signed in and VA says, okay, this is who we think you are. Are we right? Would have been, I think, would have been a better spot for it than all this.

> P1: So I have no problem with this, because I signed in. So of course you know my information, but I'm not. I'm not sure what the purpose is.

Tyler: That makes a lot of sense. It feels like it would make more sense upfront.

> P1: Hey, we just want to double check. You're Hector James, right? And you were born on. And this is your social security number, I mean? That's what we think right? All accurate, and then go into the process of asking the question.

Tyler: Right. Totally.

Tyler: Let's just imagine, before we click, continue like, what if we were reading this? And you realize, like. Oh, my preferred name is actually Hector. If you wanted to change that on this page, how would you do that? Would you be able to?

> P1: My initial reaction would be just to type just to try and type it over.

Tyler: Just type it over. Yeah. And if you did that, would it update your preferred name anywhere else? Or would it just update this page?

> P1: Alright. So my assumption is that if you're confirming with me and I fill it in. It better be updated. I mean that's kind of my assumption. That if I fix it here, it's gonna reflect.

Tyler: Okay. So if you fix it on this screen, it would reflect, and, like the rest of your information, where it's saved elsewhere.

> P1: I would hope so, because you haven't. You haven't addressed me as James or Hector yet. So why is this important? You know, if you'd said if I'd signed in and says, Welcome, James, you know we'd love to ask... That would be a little bit different. But I mean, this is a little strange, because you haven't. Nothing about this has been personalized so far, so why now?

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense.

Tyler: Awesome. So I see we've got like 7 min left. So let's go ahead and click, continue and then we'll continue on this page, too. We'll just say, like, you checked your phone and email, and you're ready to continue.

Tyler: Why don't you have a read it through this question? What do you think you would choose here?

> P1: I mean, I had a question. But again we just went through this whole process. Asking me why I contacted you. I mean the whole I mean the page is called Ask VA not say something nice about VA or suggest something to VA. It was Ask VA. So yeah, I had a question.

Tyler: Feels like a bit silly?

> P1: Yeah.

Tyler: Yeah, let's click I had a question and then go ahead and continue.

Tyler: And then we're not going to actually click anything on this page. But can you describe this to me? What's the purpose of this page?

> P1: It's a confirmation. It's a summary and confirmation of this whole process. I just went through.

> P1: Okay, so do we have your question right? Do we have your information correct?

> P1: This doesn't bother me a whole lot.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P1: This allows me to say, alright, well, so my initial reaction is okay. We're almost done. It says 100. But okay, we are getting to the end here, because. This is the double check of everything that I asked.

Tyler: That makes sense. Okay, so it's not – this one's not as bothersome. You can go ahead and click submit the question. And then you would see this page. So this would say that your question was submitted successfully.

Tyler: And just in the interest of time... I'm gonna have us come back, and just kind of reflect on what we've done. So why don't you stop sharing your screen? If that's okay, so it should say, perfect.

### Cool down

Tyler: And we just did a whole bunch of stuff, and you shared a lot of information with me which was really, really helpful. What did you like about that process?

> P1: I was flattered that the VA wants to change it, and is asking Veterans. Well flattered personally, but then also professionally. And it gave me a good feeling that the VA is looking at its processes and wants to improve them and wants to get them... So yeah.

Tyler: Yeah, okay. That's good.

Tyler: And we talked about some of the things that could change with the actual process to make it easier. One of the things we talked about really early on was you notice that 5% and that was kind of frustrating immediately?

Tyler: Can we talk a little bit more about that, like, what's your perspective on the 5%? Did you notice it changing as you went along after the first page?

> P1: I did but it didn't strike me as particularly logical. So it seems to me. Let's see, we did what 5 or 6 clicks. It seems to me that the progress bar should kind of change by that proportion as we're going on.

> P1: To be honest, I didn't notice whether it showed up every time I clicked continue. I didn't notice whether there was a progress bar every time. I don't think there was.

Tyler: Okay.

> P1: I don't think so, but I did... It seemed... I remember it was at 10%. And then suddenly, it was like way past that later on.

Tyler: Yeah.

> P1: So that's what I noticed.

Tyler: Yeah, that's helpful. So it was easier, or it was more of a focus at the beginning when it wasn't changing. And then, maybe, or in the middle of the process, we weren't paying as much attention to it.

Tyler: What's the benefit of having that?

> P1: Well, the benefit is, one, I'm getting close to being done. If you don't have the progress bar, I don't know how far through the process I am, I can kind of guess. So that's nice.

> P1: But, so maybe a hybrid is, you don't say 5% at the very beginning, and then when you're 25% done, then that's when the progress bar comes up. So it's not at the beginning. You're only 5% done. It's, you know, halfway or a quarter of the way through. Then the progress bar comes up to say, hey, you're making progress.

> P1: I think at the beginning what it means is holy sh*t. You know, I haven't done anything. So maybe there's a hybrid.

Tyler: Yeah, I think that's a really useful reflection, like at the start, it's almost unhelpful and.

> P1: Intimidating.

Tyler: Right. 

> P1: But halfway through. Hey, I'm alright. I'm getting there. Finishing up.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

Tyler: I think that's all of my questions. You've shared so much with me. And it was really really helpful. I do wanna leave a couple of minutes in case you have any questions for me?

> P1: You know. I said at the end you said, how do you feel about this? I said I was flattered, and I'm glad that the VA is making changes. But on the same token. I mean, some of this stuff is very... if a VA employee went through it themselves. Surely they would have said, Guys, this is kind of goofy. Can we change this.

> P1: So it's encouraging. It's also a tiny bit frustrating that they got to bring in a military, a contractor to and go through this big process and pay a whole bunch of money to solve problems that probably didn't need a contractor. I mean. I am very much a proponent of if I see a problem, fix it, and I think. I think VA has the capability to change some of that stuff, and for whatever reason, isn't. So very encouraging, but also a little bit frustrating of, you know. Why do we have to go through this process? I guess.

Tyler: Yeah, I hear you. That makes a lot of sense. I do understand where you're coming from.

Tyler: Well, I don't want us to go over time, and I see we're at the hour. But I do wanna say, thank you so much for joining us. It's really really useful for us to be able to watch you go through and share your thoughts, and it's also useful for us to be able to show other colleagues who might have opinions about certain questions in the form so that they can understand where you're coming from.

Tyler: So I think that's everything for me. You're gonna get a thank you note from Perigean, they're the folks who set up the session. And it should feel similar to other times you've signed up but if you have any questions you can let them know. I hope you have a lovely rest of your day.

> P1: Great Tyler. Are you a VA employee?

Tyler: I'm a contractor to the VA.

> P1: Okay. Well, but so thank you. Thank you for doing this kind of work. As a Veteran, thank you. Because it's important. And as a citizen trying to make the government better is also a good thing. So thank you.

> P1: Thank you for the work both Thomas and Khoa that you're doing in support of this. It's important stuff. So thanks.

Tyler: Well, thank you, [P1]. We really appreciate your time. Have a great rest of your day.

> P1: You too. See you.

Tyler: Bye.
