# Agent Process Research Plan

## Ask VA, Agent Process Study, December 2025

# 📚 Background

The [previous Ask VA team](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/ask-va/issues/1599), our previous [Form and Inbox Usability study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/design/User%20research/2025-10%20Form%20and%20Inbox%20Usability%20Study/Findings.md), and the ongoing user feedback have all identified the need to better understand the processes that Agents are performing on their side of Ask VA in order to provide responses to submitters. Previously, Ask VA was composed of two disparate teams – the frontend team and the backend team. We have since brought these two teams together to be much more closely aligned. This is also making it a bit easier for research to cross and influence both the [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) experience for submitters as well as the CRM experience for Agents.

In this research we are seeking to learn from Agents of different business lines. We want to understand how they leverage the inputs submitted, reroute them, and respond to Veteran and business users. We hope to uncover opportunities to improve their processes and in turn improve our submitters’ experiences with Ask VA responses.The outcome of this research will be a process map with pain points and opportunities. Additional findings and recommendations will also be documented.

# 🎯 Research Objectives

## Goals

This research will surface pain points and opportunities that exist within the different Business Lines’ Agent processes. By learning their processes we will be able to make better decisions about how to streamline the form to reduce the burden on submitters. 

We specifically hope to learn:

* The differences across business line processes for Agents in providing responses  
* How fields like category, topic, attachments, subject, contact info, and school are leveraged in the Agent’s process to triage, re-route, and respond to submissions  
* How email templates and/or knowledge bases are used to respond to inquiries  
* Business constraints and how they may be limiting an Agent


## Research questions

`1.` What are the differences in processes between business lines, and why do the differences exist?

`2.` What opportunities are there to improve response time and quality? 

`3.` How are the fields submitted in the form being used by the Agents?  

`4.` Are there differences in processes for “business” vs. “personal” inquiries?

# 🛠️ Methodology

**Research method:** Contextual inquiries

- I want to fully learn their processes, so I will have them lead me through their full process to understand their flow both in and out of the Ask VA system. 

**Moderation style:** Moderated \- facilitator led  
**Location:** Remote over VA Teams  
**Timeframe:** 60 minutes

## Research materials

**For moderated interview:**

- Stakeholder Interview Script  
- Agent Conversation guide

# 🧑‍🧒‍🧒 Recruitment

## Recruitment approach

Work with Jaime Rocha to approach some of the 19 business lines on recruiting participants. 

We will need to balance people’s availability with also trying to talk to people at different levels to gain a broad perspective. And with 19 business lines, we will not be able to speak to folks from each one.   

## Recruitment criteria

Business lines take on one of three different workforce management approaches to assign work to Agents. This research will seek to understand all 3 approaches and speak to a few business lines for each. These workforce management approaches are as follows:

- **Fill my Inbox** \- Agents hit a button and 6 inquiries are automatically assigned to them  
  - *1 business line (maybe 1-2 people from this one BL)*   
- **Supervisor hands out inquiries**   
  - *3-4 business lines (Probably just 1 person from each BL)*  
- **Agents can cherry pick based on their skillsets**   
  - *3-4 business lines (Probably just 1 person from each BL)*

**Target would be to interview 6-8 business lines and 7-10 Agents**, depending on availability. In addition to speaking with a variety of business lines, we hope to speak to Agents at various levels if possible \- newer Agents all the way up through Supervisors of Agents.
