## Tell us the reason you're contacting us?
This field is currently required. It asks, 'Tell us the reason you're contacting us?' and submitters can choose from a list of options: Compliment; Question; Service Complaint; Suggestion; Town Hall; Other. 

We recommend removing this field because:
- We learned that many [business lines don't use this information](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/research/Business%20line%20engagement/Feedback%20(initial)%20on%20form%20fields.md#tell-us-the-reason-youre-contacting-us-required).
- From a cursory analysis of past inquiries, we think it's often answered incorrectly. For example:
> Submitted as a compliment:
> "I need to obtain the transferred benefits my father gave me for college. EVERY attempt for the last [number] days has failed. I can’t even get an account for the VA.gov website. I have spoken to at least [number] people on the helpline to get the benefits and no one has helped me. There must be a way to get these benefits transferred to me so I can register for school. My father is literally about to kick me out of the house because he thinks I am not trying hard enough. Will somebody please help.”

> Submitted as service complaint:
> "Hypertension caused by Agent Orange exposure in Vietnam in [year]. Condition worsening. Would like to apply for benefits under new law.”
- Most people choose “Question". From a sample, we found that 84% of inquiries were 'Questions' and 10% were 'Other', with only 6% falling into the other 4 options.
- The Platform/Governance team has given us feedback that this field is confusing in the context of Ask VA:
> Brian, Accessibility Lead: "I was a thrown off with the phrasing of the options in the "Tell us the reason" radio buttons. Everything else on the page says "Your question" and "What's your question," then there's this follow-up question that suggests you could be providing something that's not actually a question. It seems like a strange way to present it and might lead to confusion.
- We heard this field may be important to certain stakeholders, particularly those who were involved in getting `Town Hall` added. However, Kathleen Reavy confirmed with Debi Bevins (Office of the Secretary) that they no longer need the `Town Hall` option.

### Next step
- We will recommend to the CCB that this field is removed from the form.

## Veteran's Service Start and End Dates
These fields are currently optional. They ask for the Veteran's Start and End Dates.

We recommend removing these fields because [business lines don't need this information](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/research/Business%20line%20engagement/Feedback%20on%20military%20service%20fields.md#claim-number)

### Next step
- We will recommend to the CCB that these fields are removed from the form.

## Veteran's Claim Number
This field is currently optional. It asks for the Veteran's Claim Number.

We recommend removing this field because [business lines don't need this information](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/research/Business%20line%20engagement/Feedback%20on%20military%20service%20fields.md#claim-number)
