# How we work
Borrowed, with some edits, from the MHV on VA.gov team ([view the original doc here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/health-products/health-portal/how-we-work.md)).

## We assume positive intent
**We're here because we want to improve the lives of Veterans.** Our default assumption is that everyone involved with this work has done their best to build a positive experience with what was available to them at the time. 

Smart and capable people made decisions likely influenced by forces beyond their control like legislation, policy, privacy, security, patient safety, technology, budget, or other constraints.

**Be empathetic and curious, and invite participation whenever and wherever you can.**

## Communications
### Slack
- Slack is the preferred communication channel for the Ask VA team.
- Anything written in Slack is subject to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).
- Work in the open. Limit DMs. Use our public channels.
- Never share Personal Health Information (PHI), Personally Identifiable Information (PHI), and credentials in Slack, including private channels. Use encrypted email, send a link to the GitHub va.gov-team-sensitive repo, or to the test user dashboard. When in doubt... ask your OCTO lead.
- Thread convos by replying to messages.
- If you're going to be out of office, update your status with an OOO note and the relevant dates.

### Email
- Send emails with your VA.gov email address.
- Email is the recommended option for initiating contact with OCC stakeholders and other VA business partners.
- Check your VA email regularly. Our VA partners communicate primarily via email. VA policy dictates that employees are not to discuss VA business with anyone using a non-VA email address.
- Never share Personal Health Information (PHI), Personally Identifiable Information (PHI), or log in credentials in unencrypted emails.  This includes screenshots where this type of information is visible.

### Microsoft Teams
- Use Teams chat when you need a quick response from our VA partners.

### Scheduling meetings
- Schedule meetings in Microsoft Teams from your VA.gov calendar. VA doesn't support Zoom. Many VA staff can't access it.
- Schedule team meetings or meetings with OCTO teams 5 minutes past the hour or half hour to give folks a break between back-to-back meetings. For meetings with VA partners, scheduling meetings exactly on the hour or half hour.
- Default meetings to 30 minutes, unless there's a lot to cover. Then, schedule for an hour.
- Include a quick agenda and expected outcomes in the meeting invite.
- Send pre-reads at least 24 hours before the meeting to give attendees time to reivew.
- Reschedule your meeting if an essential attendee declines the invite, such as a key team member, subject matter expert, or decision-maker.
- Check calendars before scheduling for avilability. If you can't find a time, ask before booking over an existing meeting.
- Check calendars for the whole month for recurring meetings to avoid conflicts.
- Send possible dates/times when you have a lot of attendees.
- We have team members in all US time zones, so avoid scheduling meetings before 11 AM or after 5 PM ET.
- Avoid scheduling meetings on Fridays. Many VA employees work compressed schedules and are off every other Friday.

### Communicating with our partners
- Talk to the Ask VA CRM team in either the #ask-va-integration Slack channel or our Teams General channel. Again, limit DMs. Work in the open as much as possible.
- Use email when you need to talk to other VA partners, such as business lines who are responsible for answering submitter questions.
- Also use email if you need to request anything from the Ask VA CRM team, such as requesting work to be completed or access to tools.
- When in doubt, ask your OCTO PO how best to communicate with our partners.

## Documentation
- Use GitHub and SharePoint for documentation. Do not use Google Drive, DropBox, or other systems not approved or accessible by VA.
- Never store PHI, PII, or credentials in public repositories.
