# Ask VA Form & Dashboard - Testing Plan (va.gov)    DRAFT v2

### 1. Scope and Objectives
- **Scope:** Ask VA form and dashboard covering all steps and fields, validation rules, usability and data submission.
- **Objectives:** Ensure the form functions correctly, validates input, integrates properly with the backend, [CRM and other APIs](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/ask-va/integration), and provides a smooth user experience with appropriate accessibility expectations.

**Timeline:**
IN Progress
### 2. Testing Types
- **Unit Testing:** Test individual components and functions.
- **Integration Testing:** Ensure different components work together.
- **E2E Automated Testing (Cypress):** Simulate user interactions and validate the form’s behavior, this includes mocking a user passing ICN to test flow.
- **Manual Testing:** Perform exploratory testing to catch issues not covered by automated tests.
- **Accessibility Testing:** Using appropriate tooling - inspect all pages.
### 3. Test Cases
**Unit Testing: Minimum of 80% test code coverage** 
- Test Cases: Each form field, page UI, and validation rules.
- Example: Test email field validation (e.g., valid email format, empty input).

**Integration Testing**
- **Decision:** Initial automated tests will be run locally in order to prevent blocking the pipeline. _Once Authenticated Health - I am the Vet - Myself_ passes, we’ll promote it to the build pipeline. 
  - In Scope [AT Clickable Prototype: Form Healthcare](https://www.figma.com/proto/nI0nYMdLamogjKq9t5atj8/Ask-VA-Prototype-R4-(Staging)?node-id=2001-81942&t=o7vkTV3PVbxnErNG-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=2001%3A79334) 
- Test Cases: Interaction between form steps, form data persistence between steps, backend integration.
- Example: Test backend calls, and ensure data is correctly saved and retrieved.
- The team will leverage a tool like Postman or Insomnia to send a collection of requests to the CRM APIs, the APIs will return a response body that includes a new field containing QueueID to ensure that the right CatEgory, Topic, and SubTopic are routed to the correct queue. 

**E2E Automated Testing (Cypress)**
- **Test Cases:** Full user journey, including edge cases and typical user flows - authenticated & unauthenticated.
- Example Reference: [Unauthenticated Life Insurance Cypress Test](https://gist.github.com/joehall-tw/a402d929299d15cd7a87c06d41d90967) (Proof of Concept)
- Example Scenarios: 
    1. User fills out About Yourself page, validates input, moves to Your Contact Information.
    2. User navigates back to About Yourself, checks if data persists.
    3. User completes the form and submits, verifies successful submission.
    4. Authenticated user views the submission in the dashboard
       - Pending submission
       - Completed submission
    5. Non-authenticated user checks inquiry ID on intro page
    6. Confirm submission in Agent UI, Dashboard, and Check Your Status Tool. 
- First Priority Test Case: Authenticated Health - I am the Vet - Myself

**Manual Usability & Accessibility Testing**
- Scope: 
- Test Cases: Usability, unexpected user behavior, error conditions.
- Example: Navigate the form with the keyboard, visually inspect the form, and verify form responsiveness on different devices.
  - **Required tools:** JAWS (to gain access [see Slack](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C0552U2L30S/p1715866016698579) ) 
  - **References:**  [Prototype Figma workspace](https://www.figma.com/design/nI0nYMdLamogjKq9t5atj8/Ask-VA-Prototype-R4-(Staging)?node-id=2001-79334)

The research plan can be found [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/design/Strategy/Accessibility%20audit%20plan.md) in github.  

### 4. Testing Team
- VA.gov Team: FE Unit tests, BE (Vets API) Unit tests, integration testing, accessibility testing, manual testing, and automated E2E testing.
- CRM Team: E2E testing facilitation.

- Roles and responsibilities for end-to-end (E2E) testing are as follows:
   - Testing for AVA VA.gov's web-facing, public UI will be owned by the AVA VA.gov team, guided by their test plan.
   - Testing for CRM's web-facing, public UI will be owned by the CRM team, guided by their test plan.
   - Testing steps that reference CRM's agent UI to verify queue routing will be owned by the AVA VA.gov team, with support from the CRM team as needed.
   - Testing steps that reference CRM's agent UI to reply to an inquiry will be owned by the AVA VA.gov team, with support from the CRM team as needed.
   - Testing steps that reference CRM's agent UI to reroute an inquiry will be owned by the AVA VA.gov team, with support from the CRM team as needed.
   - Testing of the CRM APIs/contracts will be performed by the CRM team.
   - Testing of the AVA VA.gov APIs/facade/middleware will be performed by the AVA VA.gov team.

### 5. Execute Testing
**Unit Testing**
- Execution:
   - Run tests using the testing framework for the repo.
   - Ensure all tests pass, we meet the coverage requirement of 80% for the repo and fix any identified issues.

**Integration Testing**
- Execution:
   - Execute integration tests to ensure seamless interaction between form steps and backend.
   - Fix integration issues.
   - **Expectation:** CRM team will build a new field into the response to return the routed queue name to facilitate integration testing in an automated fashion. 
   - Team will execute 120 tests associated with the Category, Topic, and SubTopic permutations.
   - The AVA team will submit collections ( 12 requests per collection) and 10 collections ( 120 total) to the CRM API
   - The CRM API will return a response body containing the new QueueID, together the teams will confirm that the correct Category,             Topic, and Subtopic are being routed to the correct queue. 


**E2E Automated Testing (Cypress)**
- Execution:
   - Run Cypress test suite.
   - Analyze test results and fix any identified issues.
   - Re-run tests after fixes to confirm resolution.
   - Can we toggle off a test in a higher environment? 

**Manual QA Testing**
- Execution: 
   - Conduct manual tests following the test cases and form flows.
   - Note any bugs or usability issues and prioritize fixes.
   - Retest after making fixes.

### 7. Bug Tracking and Fixing
[Bug Tracking Ways of Working](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1719508782816/0c02aafe8740074c13ea3a6821008f9f08266f5d?sender=uc2a4f18a27ff336484232897) 

Bugs will be identified by Product or Teammates when identified. Bugs will be labeled with “Bug” and will be triaged within Zenhub within the Defects swimlane, ordered by priority. 

| Category | Description | Resolution Process |
|--------------|-------------|--------------------|
| **Severity&nbsp;1** | This is a top tier. Bugs must be corrected prior to Assistive Tech Study (AT) **Example:** Unable to populate VA Health Facility Location, Incorrect Progress Bar. |Jumps backlog, potentially interrupt a developer |
| **Severity&nbsp;2** | This will impact AT, but lesser priority | Give a heads up before picking up another ticket|
| **Severity&nbsp;3** | Not blocking AT, but will be needed to be resolved prior to release **Example:** names not allowing apostrophe or hyphen | Will be ordered in backlog accordingly
