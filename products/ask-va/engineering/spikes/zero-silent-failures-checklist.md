# Ask VA zero silent failures checklist
Last updated on November 22, 2024 by: @beckyphung

I copied this checklist from [this GitHub doc](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/master/platform/practices/zero-silent-failures/how-to-discover-if-your-app-has-silent-failures.md#checklist). 

**Jump to:**
- [Start](#start)
- [Monitoring](#monitoring)
- [Reporting errors](#reporting-errors)
- [Documentation](#documentation)
- [User experience](#user-experience)
- [Next steps](#next-steps)

## Start
* [ ] Do you know when your application shipped to production?
  * If not, use Github to determine, roughly, when your application shipped to users.
  * üí¨ **Our application isn't currently shipped to production yet. We're expecting to ship April 9 ([see Mural timeline](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1715100136735/fdff4d9758a1e62c69c5962faa45c587b83c9e12)).**
  * ‚ùì Follow up with the current AVA team on silent failures/monitoring on their current portal.
  * ‚ùì What isthe current AVA team's SLA/on call times?
* [ ] Did your application use the same APIs when it shipped as it does today?
  * If not, then you'll need to consider the path user data took through both the current architecture and the previous architecture. You will need to account for potential failures in all paths since your application shipped.
  * üí¨ **See message above. Here's a [list of the APIs](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/engineering/spikes/silent-failures-and-datadog.md) we'll be using.**
## Monitoring

* [ ] Do you monitor the API that you submit to via Datadog? 
  * If not, [set up monitoring in Datadog](#set-up-monitoring-in-datadog).
  * üí¨ **We will set up monitoring in Datadog when we ship to VA.gov.**
  * ‚ùì **Plan for setting up Datadog monitoring? Ticket?**
  * When Logs column gets updated, that when we'll know monitoring is set up.
* [ ] Does your Datadog monitoring use the appropriate tagging?
  * If not, [implement tagging standards](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/monitor-tagging-standards). Adding the [dependency tag](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/monitor-tagging-standards#MonitorTaggingStandards-Recommended:dependency) is highly recommended!
  * üí¨ **We will use appropriate tagging when we ship to VA.gov.**
  * ‚ùì **What tags should we create? Plan for setting up tags? Ticket?**
  * Use recommendations in documentation above. Also health checks. Setting up tags will be part of datadog setup work.
* [ ] Do errors detected by Datadog go into a Slack notifications channel?
  * If not, start directing errors in Datadog to a dedicated Slack channel. See [#veteran-facing-forms-notifications](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C063SM22J3H) for an example.
  * üí¨ **We will create the Slack channel #ask-va-notifications to direct errors to.**
  * ‚ùì **Plan for setting up Slack channel? Ticket?**
  * Channel already there. Just need to hookup channel to monitoring. Will log seirous errors to chat.
  * State change: Will tell when the state changes from good to bad and vice versa. 
* [ ] Does more than one person look at the Slack notifications channel containing errors on a daily basis? 
  * If not, then follow this [guide on managing errors](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/master/platform/practices/zero-silent-failures/managing-errors.md)
  * üí¨ **We will create the Slack channel #ask-va-notifications to direct errors to.**
  * ‚ùì **Ticket?**
  * Round robin between all of us. If there's a problem but CRM team isn't on call with us, it's going to have to wait until the next business day.
  * What is other team's process for fixing errors?
* [ ] Do the team members monitoring the Slack channel have a system for acknowledging and responding to the errors that appear there? 
  * If not, then follow this [guide on managing errors](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/master/platform/practices/zero-silent-failures/managing-errors.md)
  * üí¨ **We will develop a process to monitor #ask-va-notifications.**
  * ‚ùì **Plan for developing process? Ticket?**
  * Should all be tracked in GitHub issues with labels. 

‚ö†Ô∏è **Failure to have endpoint monitoring in place is a blocking QA standard at Staging review as of 9/10/24.** If you answered no to any of the questions above, you will be blocked from shipping at the Staging review touchpoint in Collab Cycle.

## Reporting errors
* [ ] Have you filed issues for errors that are appearing in Datadog / Slack?
  * If not, then start filing Github issues for new categories of errors following [this guidance](#file-silent-errors-issues-in-github)
  * üí¨ **We will file issues for errors that appear in Datadog and #ask-va-notifications.**
  * ‚ùì **Plan for filing issues on our team? Who's responsible? Ticket?**
* [ ] Do all fatal errors thrown in your application end up visible to the end user either in the user interface or via email?
  * If not, then file Github issues to capture error categories following [this guidance](#file-silent-errors-issues-in-github)
  * üí¨ **We will define fatal errors and how to communicate them to the end user by UI or email.**
  * ‚ùì **Plan for defining fatal error? Plan for communicating to user by UI or email? Ticket?**
  * Talked to design about alert messages. Identify the different sad paths and how to communicate to users. Design has downtime/maintenance alerts right now. Ex: address validation fails.

## Documentation
* [ ] Do you have a diagram of the submission path that user data your application accepts takes to reach a system of record? 
  * If not, then [create a user data flow diagram](#how-to-create-a-user-data-flow-diagram) that captures this information.
  * üí¨ **We will create a user data flow diagram.**
  * ‚ùì **Plan for creating diagram? Ticket?**
  * We can document this. Architecture diagrams.
* [ ] Do you understand how the error is handled when each system in the submission path fails, is down for maintenance, or is completely down?
  * If not, then create documentation that captures how errors in each system are handled. Detail which systems retry a submission and what happens when those retries exhaust. Show this in your diagram.
  * üí¨ **We will document how errors in each system are handled. We'll include which systems retry a submission. And what happens when those retries exhaust.**
  * ‚ùì **Plan for documenting this? Ticket?**
  * Follow up with CRM team on their monitoring plan.
* [ ] Has the owner of the system of record receiving the user's data indicated in writing that their system notifies or resolves 100% of fatal errors once in their custody?
  * If not, work with OCTO to meet with the owner of the system and get their agreement in writing.
  * Please document the outcome of this conversation in your product's documentation in Github.
  * üí¨ **We identify system of record owners. We'll also get their agreement in writing.** 
  * ‚ùì **Plan for starting this conversation? Ticket?**
  * Only system of record is CRM. Others are services. We can coordinate with CRM on getting this.

## User experience
* [ ] Do you capture all of the potential points of failure and make those errors known to the user via email notification and/or through the application on VA.gov or the mobile application?
  * If not, don't worry. Few teams are doing this and we'll be providing resources to help you do this in your application. Proceed to [create a user data flow diagram](#how-to-create-a-user-data-flow-diagram). That diagram will help us to help you and your team to create this user experience.
  * üí¨ **We identify all potential points of failure and how to communicate the error to the user via UI or email.**
  * ‚ùì **Plan for designing UX to communicate errors? Ticket?**
  * Make decision if going to communicate the specifics vs. a generic message. BP to ask in silent failures channel.

## Next steps

### We don't have any silent errors!
Great! Please let us know that you went through the checklist above as a team and did not find any silent failures in our Slack channel: [#zero-silent-failures](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C07KTTFP308) and send us a link of a copy of [this](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/master/platform/practices/zero-silent-failures/how-to-discover-if-your-app-has-silent-failures.md#checklist) completed checklist. If you don't connect to a backend system, you don't need to fillout the checklist but let us know in your message. You don't have to hang out in there once you have notified us. Just pop in, tell us who you are (which team and in which portfolio) and that no failures were found. Thanks!
