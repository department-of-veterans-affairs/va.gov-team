**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS**

## Description
The current AVA Form allows users to enter in education facility information.  Currently they keep a manual listing of educational facilities that gets updated on demand and get published to the form in a release cycle.  The education facility id is used to 

VA.gov has a [GI Bill Comparison Tool](https://www.va.gov/education/gi-bill-comparison-tool) that contains a definitive list of Educational Facilities recognized by the VA.  

## Task
We need to determine if VA.gov can be used to retrieve education facility information.  The primary considerations for this decision are: 
1.  Would there be any gap in data elements if we switched from CRM Manual list to VA.gov?
2.  If we transitioned, will there be any impact to routing of inquiries?
