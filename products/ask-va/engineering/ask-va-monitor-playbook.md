# Steps

- Review the recent list of notifications for an error either in the #ask-va-notifications Slack channel or [Ask VA Datadog dashboard](https://vagov.ddog-gov.com/dashboard/i7e-qkf-zim/ask-va-dashboard-draft?fromUser=false&refresh_mode=sliding&from_ts=1741271403227&to_ts=1741876203227&live=true)
- If you're looking into an error, mention it in either the #ask-va-notifications or #ask-va-tech channels. 
- Open an issue in the [Ask VA Project Tracker](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/1033/views/1). For issues that are causing outages, disclosure of PII/PHI, or severely impacting the overall functionally of Ask VA, review the [Ask VA Incident Response Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/engineering/InfoSec/ask-va-incident-response-plan.md) for further guidance.
- Check the #vfs-all-teams , #vfs-platform-support or other platform Slack channels to confirm if any anomalies are due to platform changes or other system wide issues.
- Check whether a recent Ask VA update is causing the error.
- If the error does not appear to be caused by platform or Ask VA changes, check with the CRM team in the #ask-va-integration channel to determine if there were any changes on their end that may caused the error.
