# Datadog Status Codes
### Last Updated: April 3, 2025
Following are the error codes that are currently tracked in the [Ask VA Datadog Dashboard](https://vagov.ddog-gov.com/dashboard/i7e-qkf-zim/ask-va-dashboard-draft?fromUser=false&refresh_mode=sliding&from_ts=1741271403227&to_ts=1741876203227&live=true)
- Ask VA monitors are currently set to send notifications for 422 and 5xx (i.e. 500) error codes since those errors coincide with key user actions, and touch points with CRM.
- 401 and 404 error codes typically come VA.Gov platform and not a result of the Ask VA code.
- Not all 401s are necessarily an issue. The system is behaving as intended (i.e preventing an unauthorized user from accessing an inquiry) while also logging the "error".
