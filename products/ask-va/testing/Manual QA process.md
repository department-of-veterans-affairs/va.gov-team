Last updated: October 21, 2024 by @tygindraux

This document explains our process to manually QA Ask VA. We're primarily using this process before our expected launch on VA.gov in January 2025.

## Manual testing workflow for product/design
1. Tyler will list initial scenarios we should test.
2. Tyler will assign herself as 'tester' and make a copy of a template based on the scenario.
3. Tyler will write rules and script for a specific scenario.
4. Tyler will test staging and compare to scenario script/rules.
5. Tyler will document issues in spreadsheet.
6. Tyler will let product know when scenario(s) are complete and handover.
7. Product person will choose a scenario that is linked in the index and assign themselves as 'bug writer.'
8. Product person will either create a new bug ticket or list an existing bug ticket in the bug column.
9. In the bug ticket, product person will link to the script they were testing so developers can reference it.
10. In the spreadsheet, product person will add a link to the new bug.
11. Product person will check off scenario in index when complete.

## Creating a bug ticket
### Rules
- **Avoid rewriting the rules in multiple places.** Link to existing documentation as much as possible. This will prevent errors. See example below for [Require Veteran's branch of service for certain categories #1293](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/ask-va-647a476551689d06655cc815/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/ask-va/1293).

> - [ ] Rules are met as defined in documentation
>  
> - [ ] Tested 2 categories that require branch of service to confirm rules
> 
> - [ ] Tested 2 categories that do not require branch of service to confirm rules
- **Product, dev, or design can identify bugs.** If you're creating a ticket, just make sure to follow these steps.
- Include screenshots as needed.
- Keep comments about the bug in the ticket

### Rules for product
- **Order bugs by priority in the Caterpillars swimlane.**
- **Assign severity based on the following table.**

| Category | Description | Resolution Process | Example |
|--------------|-------------|--------------------|--|
| **Severity&nbsp;1** | This is a top tier. Pre-launch, eg. flow broken, etc. |Jumps backlog, potentially interrupt a developer |[Missing subtopics for Education category #1435](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/ask-va-647a476551689d06655cc815/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/ask-va/1435)|
| **Severity&nbsp;2** | Fast follow post-launch, eg. missing content| Give a heads up before picking up another ticket|[Remove question mark from header #1409](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/ask-va-647a476551689d06655cc815/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/ask-va/1409)|
| **Severity&nbsp;3** | Backlog, eg. spacing issues **Example:** names not allowing apostrophe or hyphen | Will be ordered in backlog accordingly|[Progress bar UI changes#1249](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/ask-va-647a476551689d06655cc815/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/ask-va/1249)|

### Steps
#### Before creating ticket
1. **Check if the bug already exists.** Do a keyword search in ZenHub for related issues. PM will archive duplicates as needed.

#### Creating the ticket
1. Copy the bug template below into an issue. ⚠️ Note: Is this bug template up to date? 
2. Add these labels to the ticket:
   - `bug`, `dev`, `dev-FE` and/or `dev-BE`, `severity [number]`
3. Assign to **Caterpillars** swimlane.
4. Add links to rules documentation.
5. Add to the correct child epic.
   - For example, if a ticket is about the "Tell about yourself" page, add it to the "Tell us about yourself" epic.
7. Tag Design (@tygindraux and @t-michaud)
