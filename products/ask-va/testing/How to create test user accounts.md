### How to create test user accounts

1. Go to [staging-api.va.gov/v1/sessions/idme_verified/new](http://staging-api.va.gov/v1/sessions/idme_verified/new) to arrive at the sign in screen.
2. Select create an ID.me account. Input your email address but add +## before @. For example, tyler+01@bluetiger.digital. Add a password.
3. Check your email and verify your email address.
4. Set up 'fake' MFA or skip this step.
5. Verify your identity or skip this step. (To skip this step, you have to close out of the window. Return to staging.va.gov, sign in with your new ID.me test user account. You'll return to ID.me and continue with steps.)
5. Allow ID.me to send information to VA.
6. You're in staging with an LOA1 (if you skipped identity verification) or LOA3 (identity verified) account.
