Last updated by @beckyphung: October 1, 2024

10/1 update: We started outlining the full scope of testing in the [Ask VA Phase 1 testing scope tracker Excel file in SharePoint](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/AskVA/EbbW0jyxC7tDvWNf346N4kkBYx7ZAff9Pt5pTOX7fODjIA?e=cX2e51).

- **What**: This document shows the different points at which the Ask VA form and dashboard change.
- **Why**: Ensure we have adequate test coverage for front-end variations before launch in January 2025.
   - This document **does not** include back-end variations and integration testing.
- **How**: Draft test scripts based on this document, which will be automated or manual, depending on what we can automate before launch.
