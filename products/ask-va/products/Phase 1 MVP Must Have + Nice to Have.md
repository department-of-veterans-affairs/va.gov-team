## Assumptions/Risks

What risks do we see that could impact are must-have deliverables?

### 1. Dependency on CRM Team
- API Layer that both exposes data to us (dashboard) and receives data from us (inquiry submission) + additional time for AVA Engineering team to implement.
- If the API layer cannot be done by CRM Team - we would need a Dynamics instance and time to ramp up.

Impact: `HIGH`

Without this work, we would not be able to send the data collected in the new AVA back to Dynamics for routing. It would prevent us from launching our MVP.

### 2. Alignment between Sitewide Content and the business lines on content updates

Impact: `LOW`

Without this alignment, we may have to stick with the names of categories and topics currently present which may not be easy and intuitive for the Veterans. This is a low risk because it would not prevent us from launching our MVP.
