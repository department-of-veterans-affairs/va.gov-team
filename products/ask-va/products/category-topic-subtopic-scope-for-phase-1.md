Last updated by @beckyphung on November 30, 2023

This document outlines the scope of category, topic, and subtopic changes for Phase 1 of the Ask VA front-end redesign on VA.gov. 

The proposed changes are documented in [this spreadsheet](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/AskVA/Shared%20Documents/General/UX/PHASE%201%20-%20Category,%20topic%20and%20subtopic%20labels%20and%20queues.xlsx?d=w0fb7bc5173cf4c3aa8e4b345eefa6552&csf=1&web=1&e=JdgPbH). The spreadsheet includes:
- name changes for existing category, topic and subtopics
- routing queues for all topics and subtopics
- which topics or subtopic to add
- which topics or subtopic to remove
- order of category, topics and subtopics lists

## Priority of changes

### "Must Have" changes for Phase 1
- Updating category, topic and subtopic names (1:1 changes)
- Adding new topic or subtopic with an existing routing queue
- Adding new topic or subtopic with a new routing queue
- Removing current topic or subtopic

### "Nice to Have" changes for Phase 1
- Including exceptions in ordering, for example, `Other` topic moves to last in the list
  - 11/30 update: For moving `Other` to the bottom of the list, the AVA back-end and front-end team agreed on updating the [Get Topics endpoint](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/integration/crm_api/Form_GetTopics.md) for making this change. See [meeting notes here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/ask-va/meeting-notes/ava-crm-team-sync).

### Not in scope changes for Phase 1
- Removing or adding categories

## Evidence to support changes
- Reviews with each business line, including meeting notes and email documentation
- Reviews with VA.gov content team, who oversees all content on VA.gov
- Alignment with the VA.gov content style guide

## Next steps
We need to a clear understanding of the development effort for the updates in order to finish prioritizing them.
