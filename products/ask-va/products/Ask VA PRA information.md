## Summary 
Ask VA doesn’t need additional Paperwork Reduction Act clearance because:  

- Ask VA is a component of the Patient Advocate Tracking System Replacement (PATS-R).  
- PATS-R has a system of records notice (SORN). 
- PATS-R's SORN applies to Ask VA. 

We confirmed this with Phillip Cauthers, a VA privacy officer on a 8/2/24 call. View complete meeting notes [in this Word doc](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/AskVA/EWdNNE1TxM1FsQOhjkrFlbwBE2vpvcuVsZcXcsHUJ23-2Q?e=g0B7pO). 

## Background 
Ask VA was previously the Inquiry Routing & Information System (IRIS) [Learn more about Ask VA’s background](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/ask-va/products) in this GitHub doc. 
IRIS previously had a [SORN](https://vaww.va.gov/IRISINFO/docs/SORN-2015-11493.pdf) and [VASI record](https://vaww.vear.ea.oit.va.gov/#system_and_application_domain_defs_system_24649.htm). 
> AVA replaces the functionality formerly provided by the Inquiry Routing and Information System (IRIS) application (VASI #1347) which has been decommissioned. 

When VA redeveloped the IRIS system as a Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM instance as Ask VA, Ask VA was developed in the existing PAST-R CRM.  

## Future plans 
We’re currently planning to separate Ask VA from PATS-R after the January launch of Ask VA on VA.gov. As a separate system, Ask VA will likely need its own SORN and record in VASI.  

Reach out to Natalie Morales (Natalie.Morales@va.gov) for more information on this effort.
