## Ask VA MVP 1- Product Outline

---

## Overview
AVA is an online portal that allows Veterans, caregivers, and supporting personnel in education, debt, loans,  etc. to submit questions to VA and receive a secure message response.

Currently, Ask VA (AVA) resides within a stand-alone Microsoft portal that is inconsistent with the VA design standards, is not mobile-friendly, and has accessibility issues. 

AVA on the modernized VA.gov platform will be a digital support channel that works with other tools and features on VA.gov and VA ecosystem to quickly and accurately answer users' questions. Users should feel it is easy and intuitive to submit their issues and receive adequate updates and information that results in a final resolution. Ultimately, we want AVA to feel part of a cohesive and user-centered approach to support.


## Problem Statement

User should easily and intuitively be able to ask a question through Ask VA on VA.gov.
   - **Who**: The user - This could be the Veteran, their caregiver, their supporting personnel, or their dependents.
   - **What**: The current form design and content is not up to VA.gov design standards, mobile-friendly, and accessible for the user.
   - **Why**: This will empower more Veterans to seek access to VA benefits and services.
   - **Where**: The form needs to reside in VA.gov so that it is easily locatable, and can potentially integrate with other applications on the platform.

**How might we** create an inquiry form that is short and simple?

 
## Desired User Outcomes

Form Design, and Content, Mobile-Friendly Experience, 508 Compliance

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach

Phase 1 MVP:
1. Stand up a page on VA.gov
>- Create a SPIKE to validate the instructions from the VAâ€™s developer docs for adding a new application to the va.gov site.
2. Bring Ask VA up to VA.gov design standards
>- Narrow down scope of use cases; including authenticated vs. unauthenticated.
>- We need to see if the full scope can be implemented in the MVP after understanding use cases, taxonomy and routing rules.
>- Write topics and categories based on content style guide (without changing form functionality and output).
>- Write form questions based on content style guide (without changing form functionality and output).
>- Update UI to reflect the VA Design System.
>- Make it mobile friendly.
>- Do iterative user research to test usability of new form design and content updates.
>- Make it 508 Compliant.
>- Complete necessary PRA updates.
3. Implement form on VA.gov
>- Understand current routing rules
>- Review existing Ask VA front-end and back-end code to see how it works
>- When Inquiry data is collected on VA.gov, it is sent to the Dynamics CRM for the agents to work through
>- Releasing this new form to a page on VA.gov
>- Build GitHub Actions workflows for deploying to DEV/STAGiNG/PROD, with automated tests and linting as the gatekeepers to those environments.
>- Understand how Dataverse and CxDW(?) play into this process.
>- Ensure devs have proper tools and permissions to build the legacy app, and work on the prototype code.
>- Ensure devs have proper access to resources in all environments.
>- Ensure devs/qa/pm have access to error logs.
>- Ensure devs/qa/pm/ux have access to analytics and reporting.
Add tools to build pipeline to run static analysis for 508 and mobile-friendly issues.
>- Understand auth and unauth access patterns. Be ready for oauth changes in the coming months from platform/identity team.

Below two dependent on spikes.\
4. Integrate with My AVA Dashboard for 
>- Status on inquiries
>- Need more information/research with Ask AVA CRM team
5. VA Notify integration
>- MyVA is creating a notification center, strategically want to integrate there for authenticated users.
>- Spike on notifications on where it stands and how we would move it to VA gov, and how VA.gov will trigger the notifications.

Our first MVP will have brought the current Ask VA up to VA.gov design standards, made the form accessible, and updated the content to make it more intuitive for our users. 

**Not included in the first MVP but will be in scope for future MVP:**
>- Surface resources using existing knowledge base
>- Inbox/secure messaging
>- Explore use of NLU/free text
>- AVA placement/integrations with chatbot and resources
>- Updated existing routing rules to smart routing
