##8/20/2024

**Agenda**

- Review Research Plan for Dashboard
- Review Mockups for Dashboard
- Questions for CRM about dashboard
 
 - **Question:** Confirming you don’t currently include the ‘We’ve received your question’ etc. first email in the dashboard, right?
 -  **Answer**: Just the response. We’ve received your inquiry is only for the unauthenticated experience. 
 -  **Question**: how are we keeping track of the new requests, Do you store/include timestamps in the dashboard (in addition to dates)?
 - 	 **Answer**: Based on the correspondence of the email, the timestamp is available and can be added
Timestamp for created on will be UTC 
		- Kyle to add, will be included in the sprint planning
	- **Question**: After a question is reopened(and also rerouted) , when VA replies back it’s moved back to closed, right?
	- **Answer:** It would not be automatically be closed
	- if they did a send and solve it would, if they just sent a correspondence then it might not automatically close.The Agent would be performing the solve.



**Notes & Key Questions: **

- How might we change statuses for an inquiry 
	- Can we get a timestamp associated with an inquiry
	- Replies are typically sent as a string, can we keep the format from the va (maintaining spaces, and paragraphs) The mock up currently is just a paragraph, uncertain if this data is formatted or is parseable
	- *Shelby confirmed there are paragraph breaks and formatting is maintained from when the message is sent. *
-  Can we determine whether something is a response or reply from a user? 
- CRM to check that data dictionary - Hemesh to ask the Team. 
- Any Updates on CRM Test Plans 
- Drafting dev. Testing vs business testing this afternoon.

  - KYLE: RPA bot needs to be reenabled in pre-prod for UAT.
- Display_name follow up (Hemesh/Khoa)
  - Only a couple more to update. All should be able to update by October, but Ed users (highest-stake users) may want to make changes closer to December? HEMESH: display_name is only used by AVA VA.gov, but CRM is implementing name and display_name at the same time.
- SHELBY/BECKY: UAT for changes deployed to prod, but the work for the launch will be done in the individual release UATs (5 or so), no specific CRM changes to test for VA.gov work.

  - Action to Chris/Kyle (Shelby to confirm correct partner)

- Potential AI Features for AVA (For after the redesigned form and dashboard - Post Release ‘25) 
  - **Goal:** validate the potential use case that we will be able to determine based on a user's question what queue does it belong to.
 - **Action:** new meeting to assist with analysis for time per queue to resolve an issue (best date 8 or 9th - Thursday / Friday) 
 - This information will help determine if the potential model will improve the ability to decrease inquiry resolution time (is this useful)
 - **Action: Becky ask Jacob** - what kind of support is needed, to determine which resource from CRM side would be assisting.

## Meeting Notes for July 23rd: 

### Agenda:
* CeeCee: Review Rollback severity + justification
* Wayne: How long do we maintain classic AVA during / post cutover
* Chris: Dark release in addition to the 1/20/25 release?
* Tyler: Dashboard Statuses

### Action Items: 
* Natalie: to check with OITC on standard timelines for maintaining original instances when cutting over to a new one 
* CeeCee : Update timeline for phased approach to review with team
* Tyler & Chris: Sync up around Dashboard.

### Proposed new Agenda for Thursday August 1st: 
* Discuss CRM UAT - Review Timeline for potential phases approaches
* Testing Users (Joe): 119 Add Classic AVA /CRM to profile
* What Metrics is CRM Capturing to date for VA.Gov or would like to capture (outside of PowerBI)?
	* benchmarking for the use of the form etc
 * * Are we tracking the response time from the Queues

### Notes:
### Rollback & Release Planning:
* New Fatal Error: Inquiry details don’t enter CRM, Submitter submits but the details don’t follow down stream 

### How long do we maintain Classic AVA during or post cutover:
#### Context: Difficulties will occur at the first new release post launch 
* AVA Recommendation: weeks not months
* Decision: VAPOs to discuss offline
* Pro: safety in terms of rollback
* Con: difficulty in maintaining 2 environments

### Action : Natalie will check with OITC on standard timelines

### Dark Release: Process & Decision
* Goal: limit the risk at time of launch before accessing the general population (soft opening)
* Context: making the phased rollout at the beginning a dark release. CRM would select their super users rather than a randomly assigned messageID, allowing CRM to help catch potential issues.
Steps:
* giving the link to selected submitters at the start 
* Then move into the canary/staged approach
* Opportunity: Still using the staged roll out approach but essentially adding an additional stage

Question re phased approach:
* Are we going to back up the timeline of development to accommodate the january 20th date?
* ### Action: Review Staged release Timeline view Next Tuesday
* Will we be development ready by this time?

### Dashboard Statuses:
* Context: some of the wording of statuses, is leading to some confusion
* Recommendation: how we might change statuses on the front end
* ### Action: Tyler & Chris to sync up

Rollout and Rollback

### Attendees:

* **AVA FE Team:** ...
* **AVA CRM Team:** ...

### Key Takeaways:

* Release will be staged 1x per day (canary monday, 25% tuesday...) for mid month
* Release will be able to be rolled back through dynamic toggles (no deployment needed)
* In case of roll back or needed notifications, CRM will upload an announcement to AVA home page
* Users will be mapped to AVA experience via a MessageID, assigned at the start of a session, which will be visible via API response.

### Action Items:

- [X] JOE: Send Branches of Service list to Chris for validation with VBA.
- [X] JOE: Schedule a new meeting to review rollout plan with CRM, including things like rollback and staggered release.
- [ ] JOE/CEECEE: Reach out to MHV or Debt Resolution Team to discuss learnings from staged release
    - Perhaps ping Travel Pay team as well since their model so closely follows ours. Might have useful insights.
- [ ] CEECEE/TERRI: Look @ powerBI to determine 10% of users
- [X] CEECEE: Define rollback severity & justification (catastrophic etc.)
- [X] JOE: Upload release plan + Notes to Gitub
- [ ] AVA VA.gov Team: Continue to gather AVA URLs
- [ ] JOE: Create a new issue to track documenting our process for post-release changes and defects, from intake to deploy. Share with CRM.

- [X] JOE/CeeCee: Discuss testing timeline, touchpoint, and their place in the roadmap for both teams in a future CRM Sync.


## Meeting Notes for CRM Sync on 07/09/2024

E2E Testing and More

### Attendees:

* **AVA FE Team:** ...
* **AVA CRM Team:** ...

### Key Takeaways:

* Category, Topic, and Subtopic now include a `display_name` field that can be used for the scenarios where CRM and VA.gov are out-of-sync. When `display_name` is null, `name` will be used instead.
* Roles and responsibilities for end-to-end (E2E) testing are as follows:
  * Testing for AVA VA.gov's web-facing, public UI will be owned by the AVA VA.gov team, guided by their test plan.
  * Testing for CRM's web-facing, public UI will be owned by the CRM team, guided by their test plan.
  * Testing steps that reference CRM's agent UI to verify queue routing will be owned by the AVA VA.gov team, with support from the CRM team as needed.
  * Testing steps that reference CRM's agent UI to reply to an inquiry will be owned by the AVA VA.gov team, with support from the CRM team as needed.
  * Testing steps that reference CRM's agent UI to reroute an inquiry will be owned by the AVA VA.gov team, with support from the CRM team as needed.
  * Testing of the CRM APIs/contracts will be performed by the CRM team.
  * Testing of the AVA VA.gov APIs/facade/middleware will be performed by the AVA VA.gov team.
* Other testing notes follow:
  * No new users will be created for testing fringe cases. Rather, we'll use mocked data for the calls to user profile to simulate edge-case users. Creating new users is a bit of a lift and should be avoided if not critically needed.
  * In testing of inquiry routing, we hope to automate some checks by using a new field on the inquiry details payload that indicates the current agent queue.
  * Becky and Joe should have access to the agent UI. We need to add Terri and CeeCee for sure, and may be wise to add/verify access for the AVA VA.gov dev team. Design already has access.
  * Agent UI access needs a login every 7 days to keep the account active. Adding a new user is a roughly 7-day process. No special roles are needed for using the agent UI.
  * The 120-ish flows refer to the permutations of Category/Topic/Subtopic selections. (This is multiplied by 4 if you include the "about ___" variants.
  * OPEN QUESTION: Does location-based routing need to be accounted for in our tests? If so, ensure those scenarios are accounted for in the test plan.
* The Branch of Service is ultimately pulled from Claims API / DEERS, via VA Profile API / Login user object. Chris will review our current list with VBA.
* Adding an optional, new "Policy Number" field to Life Insurance flow was discussed. Would be useful for the agents working that queue, but it's a showstopper. Was decided to add to the AVA VA.gov backlog for post-release implementation. AVA VA.gov to document the intake-to-deploy process.
* We need a new meeting to discuss staggered rollout, switching to the new UI, updating site-wide links, handling stale user bookmarks, and our rollback plan.

### Action Items:

- [ ] JOE: Send Branches of Service list to Chris for validation with VBA.
- [ ] JOE: Schedule a new meeting to review rollout plan with CRM, including things like rollback and staggered release.
- [ ] JOE: Create a new issue to track documenting our process for post-release changes and defects, from intake to deploy. Share with CRM.
- [ ] JOE: Create a new issue to implement the "Policy Number" field for Life Insurance flow, post-release.

	* CRM's pre-release activities (near the end of the timeline) are dependent on having VA.gov's Form and Dashboard complete.
	* CRM's API testing isn't blocked. Needs VA.gov's Test Plan to know what's being tested.
	* VA.gov is in the process of creating the Test Plan now.
	* Plan needs to be communicated to the field; Submitters alerted that there will be a new release.
	* Testing and remediation dates on CRM roadmap aren't hard and fast, can revisit the calendar.
		* Form-toStaging is when the last research study is complete and the devs have wrapped up their updates from that work, then we can start form testing.
		* Some CRM/VA.gov testing can happen concurrently. Length of E2E testing dictates.
	* Comms plan
		* Contact Center Support Guide (a key deliverable for collaboration cycle touch points for release) -- Late November for review.
		* Docs in advance of portal release so agents can guide submitters -- need to have Dashboard complete so we can get screenshots.
		* Date for E2E testing is 10/21 through 1/20?
	* Release Notes
		* OIT doc deliverable
		* Formal user-friendly docs (how their experience will differ)
		* APIs will be in PROD before official release, unreferenced except for VA.gov UI.

   * Both (VA.gov leads?): E2E testing
1. Print Inquiry?
   * Spirit: Correspondence, with inquiry for context, single print job, for paper files, used by education
   * Today CRM uses a report, VA.gov intends to use CSS styling to hide header and footer of site, then print the inquiry details page
   * BECKY: We're using the Dashboard, so changes to it may affect the print format as well
1. VA.gov has access to CRM app to help verity in E2E. So, what does CRM verify on E2E?
   * CHRIS: Anyone with permissions can see the data they need to verity results.

## Meeting Notes for CRM Sync on 05/21/2024

Handoff: Who, What, When, Where, Why, How?

### Attendees:

* **AVA FE Team:** ...
* **AVA CRM Team:** ...

### Key Takeaways:

1. What to Test
   * Common scenarios: anything specifically developed for the release, flows, validation, combinations/permutations, APIs, ...
   * Now: Test APIs
   * Later in process: Test UI, (120-ish) flows, E2E testing
1. Who to Test
   * CRM - APIs (manually and automated [Postman? Insomnia?])
   * VA.gov - UI, flows, validation (manually and automated [Cypress?])
   * Both - end-to-end testing, although the VA.gov team can use a list of expected queues, then verify with VA.gov UI and CRM agents' UI (manualluy?)
1. Why 76(?) days for code freeze / testing?
   * 76 days is typical flow for CRM to run through each environment, 10 days of testing in each environment (5 envs), 10 days for remediation (10 to find and fix in each environment); based on historical trends
     * HOLLY: is it possible to split form/dashboard for handoff separately?
     * KYLE: testing separately is fine, but E2E and UAT will require everything needs to be in place.
     * SHELBY: Would like to see it earlier, tweaks to handoff may affect timeline as they have to progress thrrough each environment, (VA.gov has access to the same tools / UIs for validation, including the existing CRM application)
     * NATALIE: also accounts for the 2 holida periods
     * SHELBY: Progression is largely dependednt on E2E testing timeline, CRM has to coordinate with PATS-R (their co-tenent in a shared Azure environment/subscription)
     * Severl folks are assigned to test, pass issues on to the devs to resolve
     * CRM = APIs; VA.gov = E2E? Fixes coordinated from each team
     * Severity and priority is assigned
     * VA.gov - QA artifacts, doc requirements on our end
1. What is the Change Process, Post-Launch?
   * Big question mark is VA.gov
   * ACTION ITEM: Natalie and Becky to talk through this one (maintenance, coordination, ...)
1. Definition of "Done"? (ACs for CRM Handoff)
   * less of a handoff, CRM and VA.gov is testing at same time
   * 120+ scenarios are working as expected, effects exist in CRM, routed correctly, visible in dashboard, ...
   * defining different relationship combos to add even more varations
   * SHELBY: firm handoff when everything is in code freeze and all tests are passing (milestone for launch)
1. On-Call Roster After Launch?
   * CRM has "office hours", plus 2 all-day meetings to cover questions, post launch; immediately follows smoke/validation testing; after-hours support is a call treeon-call to fix immediately after release

---

1. Update on VA Profile/prefered pronouns: Becky to provide notes. Would prefer not to make LARGE changes if possible. Natalie: possible phase 2? Gauge impact, then work out ETA and LoE.

## Meeting Notes for CRM Sync on 11/29/2023

Discussion of LoE for Category/Topic/Subtopic changes

### Attendees:

* **AVA FE Team:** Holly, Becky, Ruchi, Eddie, Jacob, Natalie, Joe
* **AVA CRM Team:** Chris, Jamie, Shelby, JD, Bharat

### Key Takeaways:

1. Natalie: looking for a Level of Effort for the Category/Topic/Subtopic changes
2. Chris: name-change-only items can likely be done in 1 sprint
3. Shelby: need to account for each type of change (new, deleted, edited names)
4. Tech Note: The names can affect the flow of the CRM logic as some conditional logic is driven by the display names (rather than their backing id/key). Suggestion from the devs on both sides is to add a new column to hold the display names for the new portal, then let the API send those names instead of the current names. This will allow the new portal to use the updated names, and allow for minimal (if any) changes in the CRM logic.
    * This should address the issue that Chris mentioned in an email on the name changes and reporting issues. 
  
### Action Items:

- [X] ~Holly: Update the comments in [ticket #375](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/ask-va/issues/375) with a summary of this meeting.~
- [ ] Shelby: Review Category/Topic/Subtopic changes in Teams spreadsheet; Provide a LoE estimate for each type of change present in the sheet (new, rename, deleted, …) by Tuesday's CRM Sync.

* **AVA CRM Team:** Bharat, Wayne, Chris, Kathleen, Jamie, Shelby
* **Note Taker:** Khoa

### Key Takeaways:

1. Natalie suggested a daily scrum meeting to cover our progress.
   * AVA CRM - JD, Tina, Bharat
   * AVA FE - Joe, Khoa, Jacob, Eddie (with Becky/Ruchi/Holly optional)
2. Plan is to pull data from VA Profile rather than AVA Profile.
   * Plan to leave missing pre-fill data blank on the form, and have the user enter the information, e.g. business email and phone.
   * There is some data in the form that gets added back to AVA Profile on submit.
   * Tina suggests pulling from VA, but filling in the missing data from AVA.
   * Chris says that the users most affected by this gap are the most vocal.
   * Chris added that the ID.me and Login.gov profiles are the users' personal profiles. Need a relationship to business side.
   * It wsa suggested that we start the intake process to add the missing fields to VA Profile for a longer-term solution.
   * Browsers remember previous inputs in most scenarios, but it was said that the VA-side browsers are configured to not do that.
   * Tina volunteered to document the issues for the team, send to Natalie.
  
### Action Items:

## Meeting Notes for CRM Sync on 11/07/2023

`/ping` is working; GitHub for API docs/status; Facilities

### Attendees:

* **AVA FE Team:** Joe, Khoa, Eddie, Jacob, Ruchi, Becky, Natalie
* **AVA CRM Team:** Bharat, Wayne, Chris, Kathleen, Jamie, Shelby
* **Note Taker:** Khoa

### Key Takeaways:

1. The `/ping` endpoint was shown to work behind the VA's VPN. Last step is to see it working in STAGING, which should happen before we start our API workshop on Thursday.
   * We will continue looking for a resolution to localhost development as a low-priority, background task.
2. As we collaborate, we'll keep the API documentation and endpoint statuses in GitHub.
3. Medical Facilities
   * We were looking for a system of record that is managed by a team that's upstream from our application. (Trying to not keep app-specific copies of data.)
   * Lighthouse exposes Medical Facilities that map to CRM records almost perfectly, but there are two exceptions that we discussed.
      1. Lighthouse stores Northern California facilities in a more granular way than CRM. Those facilities would need to be mapped to the parent facility.
      2. Lighthouse exposes many more facilities than have been referenced in CRM inquiries. New facilities would have to be accounted for in routing, OR mapped to the CRM catch-all facility, OR filter the larger list down to the facilities expected by AVA CRM.
   * AVA CRM mentioned that the medical facilities were OIT-directed and VAST-sourced. When asked how new facilities come into the inquiry process, it was stated that this has never happened before, but OIT should alert them.
4. Educational Facilities
   * We were looking for a system of record that is managed by a team that's upstream from our application. (Trying to not keep app-specific copies of data.)
   * We found a source of facilities that is used by the GI Bill Comparison Tool that matches the AVA CRM data almost prefectly. Only a few malformed AVA facility codes could not be matched.
   * We believe this data was sourced from WEAMS, but there is no API backing it. Dynamics CRM may be the only system of record for this.
   * AVA FE will follow up with the GI Bill team to ensure there is no API before closing the lid on this one.

### Action Items:

- [ ] Jacob: Is Lighthouse pulled from VAST? (11/14)
- [ ] Jacob: Reach out to GI Bill team to see how their list is maintained and if there's an API for it. (11/14)
- [X] ~Joe: Consolidate Category/Topic/Subtopic into a single endpoint in the API status doc.~
- [ ] Joe/Eddie: Reach out to AVA CRM see what metadata is available from the unified Category/Topic/Subtopic endpoint.
- [ ] Khoa: See `/ping` endpoint invoked from STAGING server (including the locked-down version of the endpoint).
---
- [X] ~Becky to touch base with Kathleen on military information fields this week.~\
   ~Check that fields won’t affect routing / system.~\
   ~Draft email.~
- [X] ~[Hold after convo with Kathleen] Communicate to business teams about military information.~\
   ~Send out email in tandem (Kathleen and Becky) to AVA distribution email~
- [ ] Joe and Jacob to request zero tokens and access to the appropriate Azure resources.\
   They will follow up with the support team and JD as needed for information on the resources to get access.

## Meeting Notes for CRM Sync on 11/02/2023

Focused on `/ping`; Cat/Topic/Sub; 01/02 Remainder

### Attendees:

* **AVA FE Team:** Joe, Khoa, Eddie, Natalie
* **AVA CRM Team:** JD, Chris, Shelby, Jamie, Tina, Bharat
* **Note Taker:** Joe

### Key Takeaways:

1. The `/ping` endpoint is still the focus to make sure that we can get our calls from va.gov to ask.va.gov and back.
   * AVA FE team has abandoned the attempts to get calls to work from development machines, falling back to ...
   * The development process will be frustratingly slow. But our fallback is to push every change to DEV servers for validation and testing. It's a 20-minute-per-edit difference, but ...
   * We will keep looking for a resolution to localhost development as a low-priority, background task.
2. JD recommended that we consolidate the `/category`, `/topic`, and `/subtopic` API endpoints into a single endpoint that specifies an optional parent identifier
   * Call the endpoint without an id to get a list of categories
   * Call the endpoint with a category id to get a list of topics
   * Call the endpoint with a topic id to get a list of subtopics (or empty list)
3. JD mentioned that a good bit of the topic config can be passed back as well, so that the API can help us make the UI more data-driven.
   * Many of the show/hide annotations of fields by topic is included in the tables
   * Not all scenarios are included, so can't be 100% data-driven.
4. Bharat (rightly) reminded us of the fast-approaching 01/02 date, and let us know that his team would help us in any way needed to help move things along faster.
5. Spoke briefly about data mappings between AVA/VA.
   * Verified with the CRM team that medical facility field is 3 digits in the source VA data, which helped us to later complete the mappings between the two sources.
   * Natalie reviewed the VA Profile process again and offered to help in the process if we need to add any fields (i.e. intake form, ...), asked to be included in any related meetings.
   * Eddie reminded the devs that we have a very thorough document between his SPIKE findings and Becky's related document.

### Action Items:

- [ ] Joe to tweak the API endpoint documentation for Cat/Topic/Sub, as described by JD.
- [ ] Joe and Eddie to reach out to see what metadata is available from the unified Cat/Topic/Sub endpoint.
- [ ] Khoa to wrap up `/ping` endpoint from DEV/STAGING server, to include the locked-down version of the endpoint.
- [ ] Joe to queue up the next non-ping endpoints for discussion soon, possibly for Tuesday if `/ping` has been validated in DEV.\
      ---
- [ ] Becky to touch base with Kathleen on military information fields this week.\
   Check that fields won’t affect routing / system.\
   Draft email.
- [ ] Joe and Jacob to request zero tokens and access to the appropriate Azure resources.\
   They will follow up with the support team and JD as needed for information on the resources to get access.

## Meeting Notes for CRM Sync on 10/31/2023

Focused on `/ping`; Future discussions

### Attendees:

* **AVA FE Team:** Joe, Khoa, Jacob, Eddie
* **AVA CRM Team:** JD, Chris, Shelby, Stephanie, Wayne, Tina, 
* **Note Taker:** Khoa

### Key Takeaways:

1. The `/ping` endpoint is still the focus to make sure that we can get our calls from va.gov to ask.va.gov and back.
   * AVA FE team is working through some connectivity and deployment issues.
   * AVA CRM is at the ready to answer any questions we may have.
   * In a nutshell, we're trying to hit the `/ping` endpoint that JD provided from our development machines using the SOCKS proxy. Otherwise, our development process will be frustratingly slow. But our fallback is to push every change to DEV servers for validation and testing. It's a 20-minute-per-edit difference that can make our iterations on ideas flow much more quickly. But we are timeboxing this effort to the next day (Wednesday).
2. Natalie gave the teams a heads up that she'll be facilitating a discussion during the next all-hands sync on the LOE for changes to categories/topics/subtopics that might possibly impact routing.

### Action Items:

- [x] ~Joe to document the `sec_id` -> `ICN` decision in a GitHub issue.~
- [ ] Becky to touch base with Kathleen on military information fields this week.\
   Check that fields won’t affect routing / system.\
   Draft email.
- [ ] Joe and Jacob to request zero tokens and access to the appropriate Azure resources.\
   They will follow up with the support team and JD as needed for information on the resources to get access.
- [ ] [Hold after convo with Kathleen] Communicate to business teams about military information.\

Focused on `/ping`; Baseline analytics strategy

### Attendees:

* **AVA FE Team:** Khoa, Joe, Jacob, Eddie, Ruchi
* **AVA CRM Team:** JD, Chris, Jamie, Bharat, 
* **Note Taker:** Khoa

### Key Takeaways:

1. The `/ping` endpoint will be the focus to make sure that we can get our calls from va.gov to ask.va.gov and back.
2. Rather than dump tons of data from the App Insights log, Joe and Jacob will request access to querythe data directly.

### Action Items:

- [X] ~Joe to update Thursday meetings to use Teams moving forward.~
- [ ] Joe to document the `sec_id` -> `ICN` decision in a GitHub issue.
- [ ] Becky to touch base with Kathleen on military information fields this week.\

## Meeting Notes for CRM Sync on 10/23/2023

`sec_id` potential issues; AVA data questions

### Attendees:

* **AVA FE Team:** Khoa, Joe, Jacob, Eddie
* **AVA CRM Team:** JD, Chris
* **Note Taker:** Jacob

### Key Takeaways:

1. User Auth: `sec_id` may stop being a reliable key to track users in the next 6-9 months. Identity team recommends using other fields.
   * Current SSOe solution leverages expensive, quirky hardware from IBM. Trying to move away from that.
   * Possible alternative is the credential_UUID, plus originating login provider.
   * There is a mapping table used by Identity team that maps sec_id / EDIPI / ICN.
   * When using one of the 4 identity providers, verified users have an MPI record. (Regardless of whether they're a vet or not.)
2. Ed Facilities: CRM agents edit/add facilities when a facility does not exist in the list, as reported by a submitter.
   * This is an optional field.
   * If submitter can't find the school code, they can leave it blank and pick the state (with optional feedback).
   * The code is used to find the state, so having just the state is enough for routing.
3. VA Facility: This is a mostly-static list from PATS-R.
   * If there's a discrepency, someone internal would raise it.
   * This list doesn't change much.
   * VA Facilities are hospitals.
   * This is a required field.
   * If not found, the submitter can just pick another facility, and include feedback with their selection.
4. AVA Profile / VA Profile:
   * Used for pre-fill.
   * Backend uses the pre-filled values, so those fields still need to be included with the inquiry that gets submitted.
   * Jacob to compare with the data dictionary to see which fields may be missing.
   * Need to have a business email and a personal email to split the dashboard into personal / business tabs.

### Action Items:

- [ ] Jacob to compare with the AVA Profile data dictionary to the VA Profile fields to see which fields may be missing.
- [ ] Chris believes that the sec_id may be a substring of the ICN. Needs to verify using the data that they have.

## Meeting Notes for CRM Sync on 10/19/2023

App Insights; Project Plan; Medallia; Field Removal; Teams for Syncs; sec_id Usage; AVA CRM Lower Environments

### Attendees:

* **AVA FE Team:** Khoa, Joe, Becky, Ruchi, Jacob
* **AVA CRM Team:** JD, Natalie, Tina
* **Note Taker:** Khoa

### Key Takeaways:

1. Getting a dump of the App Insights data was discussed. Joe sent an email to the key players to narrow the scope and better define what the AVA FE team is looking for.
2. The potential issues around `sec_id` were discussed. Joe shared Trevor's (from Identity Team) initial comment and response to Joe's follow up questions. Baseed on Trevor's response, and the AVA CRM team's experience in PROD, I believe this is a non issue. It's likely only an issue for people who have only ever logged in on the mobile app, bypassing the SSOe gateway.
3. Medallia was discussed in the context of Power Pages. It looks like the AVA CRM team will be blazing a new trail. Becky to send effort, acceptance criteria adependencies and filalized survey questions to Shelby.
4. Removing (rather hiding) fields was discussed. Chris emphasized the point that "required" might be interpreted by the CRM agents as "really nice to have", and described possible pitfalls around inquiry rerouting. Becky will meet with Kathleen to verifyy that the hidden fields won't affect routing, then plan a joint announcement from both teams to the LOBs as a draft email to the channels that Kathleen already has established for AVA CRM communications.
5. The move to MSFT Teams was mentioned again. Joe needs to remove the Zoom invite for the Thursday syncs and resend as Teams invite.
6. The project plan was discussed. The dates will need to be examined and tweaked. Natalie to create a MSFT Project file to replace the current spreadsheet.
7. Bharat et.al. mentioned the lower environments for the AVA CRM team. Bharat to send an email, briefing them.

### Action Items:

- [ ] ~Joe - Get list of fields to collect from App Insights data to CRM team ASAP - target of 10/19's sync.~
- [ ] ~Joe - Coordinate discussion of the use of `sec_id` in the current and new AVA applications.~
- [ ] Natalie - convert the API Project plan from Excel -> MS Project by 10/31.
- [ ] Ruchi and Becky - add the other dependencies in the Project plan by next thursday 10/26.
- [ ] Joe - add Natalie to the Teams folder.
- [ ] AVA CRM and AVA FE teams - annotate the projedct plan spreadsheet with concerns, dates, questions, ..
- [ ] Bharat - send out email brieffing of lower environments.
- [ ] JD - see if it's possible to export all the App Insights data.

- [ ] Becky - Touch base with Kathleen on military information fields this week. Check that fields won’t affect routing. Draft email.
- [ ] Becky/Kathleen - [Hold after convo with Kathleen] Communicate to business teams about military information. Notify on CCB in October 27th. Send out email in tandem (Kathleen and Becky) to AVA distribution email.

Carryover action items:

- [ ] ~JD and the va.gov AVA integration team will look for folks with KQL (Kusto Query Language) experiennce to help massage the data needed for KPIs.~
- [x] Joe - Present API Docs and granular project plan to this meeting on Thursday (10/19).
- [ ] Joe - Incorporate the steps for "done" in the granular project timeline.

## Meeting Notes for CRM Sync on 10/17/2023

Admin; Data Analysis; User Identifiers; Surveys; Field Removal

### Attendees:

* **Integration Team:** Khoa, Joe, Becky, Ruchi, Em
* **CRM Team:** Jaime, Maria, Shelby, Bharat, Kathleen, Tina, Natalie, Chris
* **Note Taker:** Khoa

### Key Takeaways:

1. Ruchi let the team know that we'll be using MS Teams for future meetings, and that invitations will be sent to everyone's VA.gov email. Bharat requested that we include the CRM team's group email, which will send the invite to both their VA emails and their contractor emails.
2. Joe requested that we get a copy of the raw data for running analysis and generating reports and graphs, rather than the planned aggregated data. An action item was added for Joe to send a list of the data (columns) that we'll need.
3. Joe brought up a concern that  was expressed by one of the members of the Identity team surrounding the use of `sec_id`. Per Trevor, "Not everyone who authenticates on VA.gov will have a sec_id, so it’s possible there are other identifiers that are more appropriate to use (again, I can help describe which ones you may prefer using, depending on your requirements)." One alternative mentioned in the sync was to send the method of authentication and the key that the authentication provider uses. This could have broad implications for the existing AVA application too.  Joe has an action item to arrange a meeting with the key players to discuss, to include the CRM team's trused identity resource, Damien.
4. Becky brought up the task to implement Medallia surveys in the current AVA application. Timelines were discussed, including the upcoming code freezes and production releases for the CRM team. It was stated that design and API discussions could continue, but development wouldn't be possible since they'll have switched into stability mode, focusing on any bug fixes that may need to be made. Shelby and Becky agreed to having a placeholder ticket put into the CRM team's backlog for this task, but that it would be blocked until the survey questions are finalized. Tina explaine that since this is uncharted territory for them, they would need to implement in a lower environment to judge the level of effort.
5. The "removal" of unused military fields was discussed. The LOBs have indicated that they're not needed, but their removal has the potential to affect routing and rerouting. The CRM team has the comms channels established for the LOBs, and the communication of the removal will be annouced jointly with the integration teeam on those channels.

### Action Items:

- [ ] Joe - Get list of fields to collect from App Insights data to CRM team ASAP - target of 10/19's sync.
- [ ] Joe - Coordinate discussion of the use of `sec_id` in the current and new AVA applications.
- [ ] Bharat - Send an email to the group on mandatory meetings that the AVA CRM team has so that we can know availability since the calendars on the va email side might not be updated.
- [ ] Kathleen - Create new placeholder task in JIRA for the Medallia survey work. Send effort, acceptance criteria, dependencies & finalized survey questions to Shelby.
- [ ] Becky - Ask Medallia team about experience on other sites.
- [ ] Becky - Touch base with Kathleen on military information fields this week. Check that fields won’t affect routing. Draft email.
- [ ] Becky/Kathleen - [Hold after convo with Kathleen] Communicate to business teams about military information. Notify on CCB in October 27th. Send out email in tandem (Kathleen and Becky) to AVA distribution email.

Carryover action items:

- [ ] JD and the va.gov AVA integration team will look for folks with KQL (Kusto Query Language) experiennce to help massage the data needed for KPIs.
- [ ] Joe - Present API Docs and granular project plan to this meeting on Thursday (10/19).
- [ ] Joe - Incorporate the steps for "done" in the granular project timeline.

## Meeting Notes for CRM Sync on 10/12/2023

Analytics; Refactoring Categories/Topics/Subtopics

### Attendees:

* **Integration Team:** Ruchi, Khoa, Joe, Becky
* **CRM Team:** Chris, Joseph Duty, Shelby, Tina
* **Note Taker:** Ruchi

### Key Takeaways:

**The two pieces of information for the KPIs of the current AVA application:**

1. The time it takes for a submitter to submit an inquiry
  * If an inquiry  was submitted, how long did it take from the start of a session to the end of the session?
  * For submitters that submitted an inquiry, what is the average time that it took them from the time that they landed on the ask.va.gov page to the time that they clicked submit?
  * For submitters that submitted an inquiry, what is the average time that it took them from the time the NEXT button is clicked in "Tell us about your question" page to the time that they clicked submit?
> >  _Data collected should include the submitter's device and whether they were authenticated or not._
2. The percentage of users that complete the journey to submit their inquiry
  * What percentage of submitters completed the user journey once beginning the session?
  * Numerator: Submitters that completed the journey (the submission confirmation page).
  * Denominator: Total number of submitters that click the NEXT button on “Tell us about your question” page. (This shows intent to submit an inquiry.)
> >  _Data collected should include the submitter's device and whether they were authenticated or not._

**Four levels of changes identified so far:**

* Minimal: Name change only. No impact to routing.
* Low-mid: Name changes on situations where it impacts rules on other fields.
* Low-Mid: Remove topic or subtopic. Need to figure out if archival is needed or transferred. 
* Low-mid: Add-Topic or subtopic. Impact to routing.
* High-Mid: Remove or add topic or subtopic. Existing queue needs to be added.
* Most: Remove or add topic or subtopic. An entirely new queue needs to be created.
> To mitigate instances where a name change might affect routing, the Dynamics APIs will track a new column (e.g. 'name_on_portal') with the va.gov UI's expected name for the selection. When that column has a NULL, the query will coallese back to the legacy name. The Dynamics APIs will handle mapping those values back to the originating row.
> 
> JOE: In this scenario, we could just pass the key back in. No need for the mapping in Dynamics APIs since this isn't a piece of data that conflicts with the va.gov sources &mdash; it only lives in Dynamics. We WILL need that new column for the name on portal, though.

**Where does the source of truth live?**

* Dynamics &mdash; We need to collaborate on each situation to make sure that we understand the ins and outs of each change.
> JOE: There are some data items that **MUST** be pulled from Dynamics. But, there are several pieces of data that we plan to pull from the va.gov APIs. That distinction will be documented in the API Contract documentation next week.

### Action Items:

- [ ] JD and the va.gov AVA integration team will look for folks with KQL (Kusto Query Language) experiennce to help massage the data needed for KPIs.
- [ ] Joe - Present API Docs and granular project plan to this meeting next Tuesday (10/17), Thursday at the latest.
- [ ] Joe - Incorporate the steps for "done" in the granular project timeline.

## Meeting Notes for CRM Sync on 10/6/2023 (off-cycle, ad-hoc meeeting)

Plan of attack; System of record; Continuous communication.

### Attendees:

* **Integration Team:** Joe, Jacob, Eddie, Ruchi, Em
* **CRM Team:** Chris, Shelby, Joseph Duty, Jamie
* **Note Taker:** Eddie

### Key Takeaways:

* Improved Communication
  * Meeting notes to follow every CRM sync, posted to GitHub, with link sent to Slack and Email.
* Plan of Attack
  * Implement "ping/pong" endpoint first to ensure we can call into Dynamics API servers and get a response.
  * Implement lookup APIs, since they have a lower complexity.
  * Implement submit inquiry ennpoint later, since it's dependent on other APIs and has more complexity.
* System(s) of Record (SoR)
  * There are two basic, oposing options:
    1. Treat Dynamics as the system of record, and everything will simply work since the keys and values will match themselves.
    2. Use the va.gov-directed APIs for lookups and profile data, which carries the risk that values will not match between the form and data in Dynamics' Dataverse.
  * Scenarios to explore:
    * Verify that "simple" lookups like State, Province, Military bases, and Diplomatic addresses will work as intended if pulled from Lighthouse.
    * Email address should match for the CRM agent to pull veterans' history. Can this be made so when calling VA Profile?
    * Email preference for submitter in AVA should be honored. Will the VA Profile equivalent satisfy this requirement?
    * How will we determine vet versus submitter versus agent on vet's behalf without Dynamics as SoR?
    * How will we distinguish between personal and business profile?
  * Important systems for the Dynamics side include the following. Should we use same if we're not using Dynamics as SoR?
    * WEAMS
    * PATSR
    * CORE (?? - confirm with Chris)
    * Difference between Facilities API and the data in Dynamics where agents can add and edit entries?
* Level of detail on granular plan on 10/12:
  * account for the same tasks for all API endpoints
    * documentation
    * development
    * testing
    * integration / validation
    * What does "done" look like?

### Action Items:

1. - [X] Joe to send GitHub link of meeting notes to larger email group and #ask-va-public Slack channel, after every CRM Sync.
1. - [ ] Joe to incorporate the steps for "done" in the granular project timeline.

## Meeting Notes for CRM Sync on 10/5/2023

Timelines discussed. Analytics considered.

### Attendees:

* **Integration Team:** Joe, Jacob, Khoa, Eddie
* **CRM Team:** Chris, Shelby, Tina
* **Note Taker:** Eddie, Khoa

### Key Takeaways:

* There was a discussion around the implications of not using Dynamics as the system of record. CRM team expressed concerns.
  * RE: AVA Profile, email address preference is used internally
  * RE: Education lookups, data can be edited/added by agents
  * RE: CRM tools, agent can look up history if the email matches, but may not match if comming from VA Profile
  * How to determine vet versus submitter
  * How to distinguish between personal and business profile
* There seems to be confusion on what API will be developed first.
  * First should be the "ping/pong" endpoint. We need to ensure the plumbing works as intended.
  * Submitting Inquiry should happen towards the end of the dev work.
  * Lookups are prime candidates for early implementation, but we need to know which are Dynamics and which will be va.gov APIs. To be settled by the time the 10/10 documentation is wrapped up.
  * We will discuss this in more detail on 10/6, in a meeting Becky has set up.

### Action Items:

1. - [ ] Joe to send GitHub link to meeting note link to larger email group, incl. Em if not already on the list.
2. - [ ] Joe and devs to wrap up API documentation by 10/10 for final review and feedback from CRM team after that.
3. - [ ] Joe (and Ruchi/Becky) to create a granular timeline in a spreadsheet by 10/12 that CRM can review and offer feedback.
4. - [ ] Joe to schedule a meeting after the documents are reviewed by CRM; agenda to include using or not using Dynamics as the SoR.

## Meeting Notes for CRM Sync on 10/3/2023

Timelines discussed. Analytics considered.

### Attendees:

* **Integration Team:** Joe, Jacob, Khoa, Becky, Tyler, Eddie
* **CRM Team:** Chris, Shelby, Tina, Bharat, Maria, Jamie, Cheri, Brad, (Joseph Duty last ½), George, Wayne
* **Note Taker:** Khoa

### Key Takeaways:

* Medallia meeting with CRM needs to be rescheduled, conflicts with existing meetings for key players on CRM team. Becky is coordinating.
* We need to incorporate recent feedback from the CRM team into our contract document. For example, the reply_enabled field is a calculated value, sent from CRM when requesting inquiry replies. Many other annotations to incorporate.
* CRM felt that the summary timeline document needs more granularity before they can officially commit to the work of building the APIs. The contract needs to be solidified before they can estimate the level of effort. Based on initial review by CRM team, December 12th date isn’t achievable. Dates need to align with their release schedule if possible.
* Medallia survey is dependednt on the upcoming meeting. Need to scope level of effort for this task. May want to group multiple deliverables into a maintenance release. (Maintenance releases are possible, but generally reserved for bug fixes.)
* Field removal work needs to be a separate meeting to see if any omissions will affect routing or validation. Most of this work is baked into other tasks. Hard to cite a delivery date.
* Google Analytics date is currently after code freeze. CRM team needs more guidance. Becky will coordinate with the platform team to share the needed info.
* CRM team suggested a CCB presentation in Fall '23.
* Joseph Duty: some of the dates are after the contract ends, RISK; Bharat: but VA has an intention to extend the contract.

### Action Items:

1. Integration team to knock out the remaining tasks on the contract document. Need to give an ETA on when this will be done. Then do it. — Joe / Devs
1. Integration team to deliver a more granular timeline, with milestones/touchpoints for CRM team. (e.g. integration testing complete, launch date, portal maintenance plan). — Joe / Ruchi / Becky
1. Google Analytics guidance from Becky / Platform team to CRM team. — Becky / Joe(?)
1. Need working. agreement for new requirements (post-launch), changes, … responsibilities of the two teams. — Ruchi / Becky
1. Communication plan for stakeholders - banner messages are typical, may be contractual issues where agents been to have a quota of inquiries completed, … — Ruchi / Becky
1. Google analytics needs to be tested alongside the built-in analytics for Power Apps. Dev environment would be enough to prove stability, and carry the lowest risk. — Joseph Duty (w/ guidance from platform team and Becky)

## Meeting Notes for CRM Sync on 9/28/2023

Chris returns. Several topics covered.

### Attendees: 

* **Integration:** Joe, Jacob, Khoa, Chante
* **CRM:** Shelby, Joseph Duty, Chris
* **Note Taker:** Khoa

### Takeaways:

1. Clarified the environment mappings.
   * Vets-api Prod => Dynamics Prod
   * Vets-api staging => Dynamics QA
   * Vets-api dev => Dynamics dev
2. Discussed Google Analytics in Dynamics UI.
   * Mentioned need to collect baseline data before launch of new UI.
   * Determined to be a low level of effort, but need to figure the logistics out.
   * Joseph Duty raised concern about potential for GA interfereing with built-in analytics for Power Apps.
3. Discussed inquiry archiving to fill in gaps in our understanding.
   * Inquiries/replies are never removed from Dataverse, they're just marked with a Closed status.
   * Data is copied to CxDW nightly, but Dataverse is considered the system of record.
   * Another benefit of closing an inquiry is to prevent user from asking a new question by replying to an old inquiry.
   * Business line sets reply windoe to 0-100 days, with most being 10 days.
4. Discussed paging of data for the dashboard.
   * Liist of inquiries returned in full.
   * List of replies for an inquiry returned in full.
   * Attachments are referenced in inquiries and replies by ID. Requested via separate API call. Likely Base-64 encoded.
5. Reminded attendees of the timeline to be shared in the next meeting (Tuesday).

### Action Items:

1. Retrieve Correspondence - needs updates, question for Shelby and Chris, but mostly confirmation that we were just mapping our fields to the data dictionary, not requesting new fields. – CRM Devs
2. Post Correspondence - needs update - Integration Devs
3. Remaining endpoints need to be cleaned up and finalized. – Integration Devs

## Meeting Notes for CRM Sync on 9/26/2023

This was a brief meeting. We'll have more to discuss when Chris is back online.

### Attendees: 

* **Integration:** Joe, Jacob, Khoa, Chante, Becky
* **CRM:** Shelby, Joseph Duty, Tina Purguy, Maria King
* **Note Taker:** Khoa

### Takeaways:

1. Joseph Duty told us that all server resources have been provisioned. We'll map our va.gov environments to their CRM environments. They have 5, we have 3 (two of which are technically the same). Likely something along the lines of our dev to their test, our staging to their staging, our prod to their prod-1.
2. Text search within inquiries should be doable.
	* CRM would expose this functionality to us
	* We would incorporate that functionality into our UI
	* Only active messages would be searched (not archived)
	* Only message bodies in inquiry or replies would be searched (not subjects)
3. Joseph had some feedback on the API endpoints that we documented.
	* He said that what he saw of Read Profile was 80%-90% there.
	* Most of his questions were for Chris and Shelby.
	* He wanted to confirm that we were matching our fields to their data dictionary as best we knew, and not asking for new fields. I confirmed that was the case.
	* Post Correspondence needs some love.
4. I mentioned that we intend to share a rough timeline with them on the next Tuesday sync that calls out milestones/dates and the dependencies on CRM that we have.

### Action Items:

1. Chante, Ruchi, and Tina will follow up on connecting CRM with the Medallia teeam to iron out the technical details for implementing in Dynamics.
2. Joe to add question about how inquiries are archived to the next CRM sync agenda.
