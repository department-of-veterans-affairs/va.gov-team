Meeting notes have been added to the epic.

Becky Phung, Stephanie Vargo and Jaime Rocha met with the following business lines to introduce the work efforts that are beginning re; sending satisfaction email to submimtters.
- VBA (Veterans Benefits Administration)
- Life Insurance
- NCA (National Cemetary Administration)
- ECM + HAC (Enrollment Case Management + Health Administration Center)
- CWV + CMV (Center for Women Veterans + Center for Minority Veterans)
- *BVA (Board of Veterans Appeals) - cx'd*

# Problem Statement
We don't know to what extent submitters think answers they get through Ask VA are helpful.

# Why
- We don't measure submitter satisfaction with Ask VA answers
- We only measure satisfaction with Ask VA product on va.gov
- We can't easily tie current feedback to queues/agent responses right now
  
# Opportunities
- Send email after submitter receieves a response from VA agents
- Improve responses after reviewing 'No' responses tied to inquiry replies

Dear [Submitter First Name],

Thank you for contacting the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.

Did our reply answer your question?

[Yes or no]

Your feedback will help us improve. Thank you.

Note: We're still clarifying how we will implement this. We may include a link to a survey. Overall, we want to ask a yes or no question about whether their question was answered.

# Feedback from Business Lines
# NCA
- Concerned with costs and curious if we have spoken to the COR (contracting officer).  Jaime Rocha, Becky Phung and Stephanie Vargo explained we would be leveraging existing tech stack and tooling at no costs.
- Individual felt the current drafted question is broad and doensn't point to what a submitter is/is not satisfied with.

# VBA
- Concerns with allowing for only a yes/no response from a submitter because agents often cannot provided detailed answers to questions regarding claim status, example: how long will resolution take?

# Life Insurance
- Wanted to know if a user could respond to email and create a never-ending inquiry thread and/or new inquiry.
- Stephanie indicated the email would not be designed to allow for responsed other than a yes/no.
- Stephanie suggested modifying to current email draft to include language like "go to va.gov to submit a new question or reply to an existing question" so submitters have a redirect.

# ECM + HAC
- No feedback re; sending email to submitters
- Concerns with existing Ask VA form and spending hours on the phone with Veterans to help them navigate through the form to submit attachments that are missing from original question or the agent requires updated forms.
- Asked for a script to direct Veterans over the phone more easily, since agents are not certain the right prompts to select to get Veterans to an area to attach forms (Stephanie will create a business line request ticket).
- Questioned why certain people on the team are receiving inquiries to queues (sometimes need to reroute), Jaime suggested at our next meeting a team member demo the experience they are having so we can understand the issue better.
