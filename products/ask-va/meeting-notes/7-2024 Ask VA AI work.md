We reviewed [this Mural board](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1719949263359/22d8bf1e2d70fac8a9da7e57ca6642e2e23724fb?sender=u44efa807e992cacf10cf3697). It outlines different Ask VA AI use cases we could start prioritizing. 

## Key takeaways
- We'll first work on developing an AI model to **determine queue from question text**. We'll test with agents first to improve rerouting. We'll also need to understand CRM's capability to recommend items in a drop-down list based on our model.
- Alex can connect us with data scientists on the OCTO AI team to support this work and pair with Jacob.
- Jacob will tie up loose ends on current AI-related tickets in ZenHub by end of next week.
- We'll continue updating the MCT issue code report team on our work, but we won't be dependent on each other.
