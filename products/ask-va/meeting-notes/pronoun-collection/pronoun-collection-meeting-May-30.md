### Question: 
Should Ask VA gather the pronoun information for the subject when the submitter and subject aren't the same user?

### Answer: 
No, pronouns are self identifying and we wouldn't want the submitter to gather this information. The Ask VA rep would use the subjects full name when responding to inquiries.

## Next Steps:
- Ask VA team will ensure designs do not ask for the subjects pronouns when the submitter is a different user
- Ideal state is to send back any profile changes to update VA.gov profile. Currently pronoun is not a gathered field but that is something that they intend to add soon.
