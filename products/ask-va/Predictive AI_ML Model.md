# Notes provided by Ask VA PO, Becky Phung on 12/22/2025

- Ship different business flow at the beginning of form (affects all users)
  - Work on adding the fork at the beginning of form. Maybe keep the exact same flow for now.
  - Then explore q's to remove in the biz flow as iterations.
- Then ship the inference service/topic classification based on question/whatever we're calling it but only for some % of users only on the personal flow.

This allows us to keep the same order + subject field + attachments on the question page for the business use case

But for personal inquiries, we'll be able to:
  - Move q to the front.
  - Move attachment to seperate page.
  - Remove subject

All of this will still require some level of agreement from biz lines, but hopefully something that'll be easier for them to agree to
