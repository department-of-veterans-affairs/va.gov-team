## Overview
Ask VA users submit questions at, [Ask VA](https://www.va.gov/contact-us/ask-va/introduction).  An authenticated (logged in) user can view a personalized inbox of their submitted questions, progress statuses, and received replies.  

In 2025 the Ask VA team executed an [Inbox Usability Study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/ask-va/design/User%20research/2025-10%20Form%20and%20Inbox%20Usability%20Study). 
Key findings support implementing enhancements to the current inbox experience.

During design activities, VA Design System (VADS) guidance was identified for Ask VA to adopt the [new standard](https://design.va.gov/components/search-filter).

## Problem statement
**Background**

Ask VA users want to easily and quickly view their submitted questions using; search, filter and sort tooling. The current inbox experience displays submitted questions (also referred to as "inquiries") in a grid format, with a card representing each inquiry.  The cards do not display in a user friendly way, often leaving users confused of the order their information is displayed.  Users want the ability to filter their inquiries by category type, status and sort by newest to oldest or oldest to newest.

**Solution**

Update the Ask VA inbox by implementing the VADS guidance and [new standard](https://design.va.gov/components/search-filter).

## Outcomes
- **User Experience Outcomes**: Users have an accessible and easy interaction with their personalized inbox.
-  **Functional Outcomes**:  The VADS guidance and standard operates correctly with Ask VA application.
- **Business Outcomes**: Improved inbox usability and efficiency for Ask VA users.  Decreased dissatisfied feedback collected via the feedback button and intercept survey responses.
