## Overview
Ask VA (AVA) is a digital support channel for Veterans, family members and other submitters. You can use Ask VA to ask a question about education benefits, disability compensation, health care and many other topics. Ask VA should only be used for non-urgent needs.

You can currently reach Ask VA at [ask.va.gov](https://ask.va.gov/). By end of March 2025, you'll be able to reach Ask VA on VA.gov at [va.gov/contact-us/ask-va](https://va.gov/contact-us/ask-va).

## Problem statement
**Background**: Veterans and family members can ask a variety of questions to VA because VA offers many different types of benefits. There are different VA staff teams, each specialized in answering specific types of questions. Reaching out to VA online can be more convenient and accessible than calling or visiting a VA facility in person.

**Ask VA's solution**: Ask VA is frontend application (contact form and inbox) where Veterans, family members, and other submitters can get answers to any VA question. Users don't need to understand VA's internal bureaucracy to ensure they get a correct answer to their question. The frontend integrates with a backend customer relationship management (CRM) application that routes questions to the appropriate VA team. Multiple VA teams can access and use the CRM.

## Outcomes
- **User experience outcomes**: Ensure users have an easy and accessible interaction with Ask VA.
- **Functional outcomes**: Ensure the system operates correctly and efficiently with Ask VA.
- **Business outcomes**: Ensures increased efficiency for VA customer support.

## Measuring success
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) help us understand how Ask VA is meeting expected submitter outcomes and operational performance of our Ask VA application. We'll track these primary KPIs over time.

### User experience KPIs
- **Satisfaction**: Increase customer satisfaction score (CSAT) for form and dashboard
- **Experience**: Increase experience rating for form and dashboard
- **Form completion rate**: Increase the percentage of questions successfully sent by submitters for form
- **Time to submit form**: Decrease the average time it takes submitters to send a question for form
- **Reply rate**: Increase the number of replies to questions for dashboard
- **Time to reply**: Decrease the average time it takes submitters to reply to a question for dashboard

Note: The satisfaction and experience metrics are different. The satisfaction rating comes from the [Medallia feedback button survey](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/analytics-monitoring/accessing-and-utilizing-contact-center-data#AccessingandUtilizingVeteranSupportData-FeedbackSurveyQuestions). The experience rating comes from the [Medallia intercept survey](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/analytics-monitoring/accessing-and-utilizing-contact-center-data#AccessingandUtilizingVeteranSupportData-MedalliaInterceptSurveyQuestions).

### Performance KPIs
- **Zero silent failures**: At any point in time, there are zero silent failures in sending or receiving data needed for VA agents to answer submitter questions for form and dashboard
- **Error rates**: Decrease error rates in sending or receiving data from the Ask VA CRM and other APIs
- **Latency**: Decrease average time to receive data from the Ask VA CRM and other APIs
- **Throughput**: Increase the number of transactions without impact to latency or error rates
