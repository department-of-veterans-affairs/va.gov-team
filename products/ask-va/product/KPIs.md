These KPIs help us understand how Ask VA is meeting expected submitter outcomes and operational performance of our Ask VA application. We'll benchmark our KPIs against VA.gov metrics.

## KPIs (Pick max 3-5):

### Time it takes to submit an inquiry (Reduce this by X%)
If an inquiry was submitted, how long did it take from the start of a session to the end of the session?

Currently, submitters take an average time of ___ to submit an inquiry.

#### To capture the current KPI on this for ask.va.gov
- **For the submitters that submitted an inquiry**
  - What is the average time that it took them from the time that they **landed on the ask.va.gov** to the time that they clicked submit.
  - What is the average time that it took them from the time the **NEXT button is clicked in the ‚ÄúTell us about your question‚Äù page** to the time that they clicked submit.

We do want the data to show authenticated vs. unauthenticated, and type of device. 

When we go live with our new front-end on VA.gov, submitters take an average time of ___ to submit an inquiry. 
- We will use Google Analytics to capture the start and end of a session.

### Percentage of submitters that complete the journey to submit their inquiry with information on what device was used (Increase by X%).
What percentage of submitters completed the user journey once beginning the session?

Currently, ____ percentage of users complete the user journey after beginning the session. 

#### To capture current KPI on this for ask.va.gov, the calculation would be as follows
- **Numerator**: Submitters that completed the journey (end on submission confirmation page)
- **Denominator**: Total number of submitters that click the NEXT button on ‚ÄúTell us about your question‚Äù page (shows intent to submit an inquiry)

When we go live with our new front-end on VA.gov, ____ percentage of users complete the user journey after beginning the session. 
- We will use Google Analytics to capture what percentage of submitters completed the journey
- We do want the data to show authenticated vs. unauthenticated users and type of device. 


### Submitter satisfaction
Meet the target VA.gov satisfaction score (59% - fluid metric). Logic: 59% of the users rated their VA.gov experience as a 4 or 5 on 5 point scale (Medallia survey).

- To capture current KPI on this for ask.va.gov, we need to introduce the Medallia survey on ask.va.gov to capture this metric.
- To capture this metric in our new front-end on VA.gov, we will add the Medallia survey to VA.gov.

## Metrics that we want to monitor for awareness:
- % of rerouted cases
- Resolution time

## KPIs that are not a good fit at this time:
- 20% of submitters get answers to their questions without submitting an issue
- Case resolution time is decreased by x%
- Rerouted cases are reduced by 50%
