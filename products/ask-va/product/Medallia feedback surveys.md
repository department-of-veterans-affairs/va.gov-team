# Medallia feedback surveys: Trigger events and questions
Updated by @beckyphung on: November 19, 2024

## Background
We will include two Medallia surveys in the Ask VA flow, an intercept survey and a feedback button. 

- **11/19 update**: We've decided to not move forward with the intercept survey on ask.va.gov.
- The intercept survey on va.gov/contact-us/ask-va will interrupt 5% of users based on a triggering event (a step in the flow). 
- The feedback button on both the current and new front-end will show a feedback survey (2 questions) when a user clicks on the feedback button, which will be available on all pages.

Both surveys are shown in modals. We will add these surveys to ask.va.gov (to establish a baseline) and Ask VA on VA.gov at va.gov/contact-us/ask-va.

## Intercept survey

### Future form: va.gov/contact-us/ask-va
- Intercept survey triggered for 5% of users.
- The survey triggers only once per session.
- The survey triggers when the user lands on the **Your contact information** page.
   - Joe mentioned can call the script from anywhere in the form.
   - Todd would need some time to determine.

See **Your contact information** page:
