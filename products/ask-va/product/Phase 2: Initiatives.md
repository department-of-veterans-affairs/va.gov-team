# Phase 2: Initiatives - January to March

Last updated by @tygindraux: January 30, 2025

## Goals
In Phase 2, we will find a balance between making quick, responsive improvements to the product while also bringing partners along on the journey. 

From January to March, our goals are to:

1. **How we work:** Set up teams for collaboration and long-term success
2. **User experience:** Test concepts for improving the submitter experience
3. **Data:** Plan how we monitor and use unmoderated feedback

## Principles
In Phase 2, we will be guided by these principles:

- **Collaboration:** Communicate transparently, be empathetic and curious, and invite participation
- **Agile:** Run small experiments and release often
- **Data-driven:** Work towards improving KPIs and analyzing data to understand user experience

### Co-define a product vision with partners
We will co-define a product vision for Ask VA with our partners. We recognize that our objectives may not be constant across teams, or even across business lines. We believe through planned exercises and discussion, we can define a shared vision to guide Phase 2.

#### This initiative will:
- Be led by product
- Be supported by design
- Be in partnership with CRM and business lines
- Be timeboxed to 4 sprints
- Start with our team aligning on a shared product vision internally
- Move on to aligning on a shared vision with CRM, followed by business lines
- Involve a series of conversations and workshops
- Involve sharing a slide deck that describes our product vision to Jaime and Natalie

#### We will deliver:
- An updated product outline in Github based on our shared vision
- A slide deck that explains our shared product vision

### Set up a workflow for tracking and prioritizing business line requests
We will work closely with CRM to define a process to track, prioritize and action business line requests. We will set up a shared spreadsheet (or workspace) that is available to both teams. This will provide greater transparency and a defined workflow will make us more efficient.

#### This initiative will:
- Be led by product
- Be supported by design
- Be in partnership with CRM
- Be timeboxed to 2 sprints
- Start with learning the CRM teams current process for tracking, prioritizing and actioning requests from business lines 
- Involve setting up a shared spreadsheet (or workspace) that is accessible to both teams
- Require us to move any backlogged and current tasks to the shared space

#### We will deliver:
- A shared spreadsheet (or workspace) with a backlog and current tasks

### Priority #1: Test concepts with submitters that involve automation
We will prototype and test concepts where a submitter interacts with some type of automation. This might include testing concepts where a submitter receives an answer to a simple, close-ended question up front, or, where a submitter chooses a category, types their question and a topic is recommended to them. 

#### This initiative will:
- Be led by design
- Be supported by engineering (Jacob)
- Be timeboxed to 4 sprints
- Involve no-code prototyping in Figma
- Go through Research Review (Platform team review)
- Recruit Veterans for testing, including those with cognitive disabilities
- Involve learning how to implement 1 concept (whichever is recommended)
- Not include implementation

#### We will deliver:
- A set of insights
- A set of recommendations
- At least 1 and no more than 4 concepts that have been prototyped in Figma
- A spike that describes how to implement 1 concept

### Priority #2: Design a page to explain the types of questions within a category
We will design a page that allows us to explain the types of questions that can be asked within a category. There are some categories with many topics that route to the same place. Designing a page that lets us explain the types of questions you can ask, may help us reduce the number of categories and/or topic options without automation.

#### This initiative will:
- Be led by design
- Be timeboxed to 1 sprint
- Involve no-code prototyping in Figma
- Not include testing with Veterans or other submitters
- Not include implementation
- Not include approval from the Change Control Board

#### We will deliver:
- A design that is ready for testing and/or sharing with the Change Control Board

### Priority #3: Do a comparative analysis of contact experiences
We will do a comparative analysis of contact forms to inform our future product vision. This will help us articulate the things we like or don’t like and where we want to go with Ask VA. It will be a visual exercise which can support future conversations.

#### This initiative will:
- Be led by design
- Be supported by product
- Be timeboxed to 1 sprint
- Build on the Contact Us comparative analysis that Becky has done
- Inform our collaborative product visioning exercises

#### We will deliver:
- A comparative analysis of multiple (at least 3) contact experiences

### Do research to understand and observe agent processes
We will gather insights about agent processes through observations and interviews. We will do this in partnership with CRM. We will invite all business lines to participate but we recognize that not all will choose to take part. This will allow us and CRM to make more informed decisions that benefit submitters and agents.

#### This initiative will:
- Be led by design
- Be supported by product
- Be in partnership with CRM and business lines
- Be timeboxed to 2 sprints
- Include gathering information from CRM instead of business lines when possible
- Prioritize observations over interviews
- Invite all business lines to participate with the expectation that not all will

#### We will deliver:
- A map of the agent reply process
- A set of findings about business lines and agent processes

### Update designs to use new VA Design System patterns
We will update any designs to use new VA Design System patterns, where relevant. For example, there is a new prefill pattern we should update.

#### This initiative will:
- Be led by design
- Be timeboxed to 1 sprint
- Involve reviewing updates to VA Design System
- Involve making updates in Figma that are ready for implementation
- Not include implementation

#### We will deliver:
- A new Figma Page Library for Phase 2 that includes updated designs

### Prepare a follow-up email to send after a question is closed
We will write a follow-up email that should be sent to every submitter after a question is closed by an agent. This will allow us to capture inquiry specific feedback after the last step in a user’s journey. We can use this feedback to learn whether replies from VA are helping submitters complete the tasks they set out to do.

#### This initiative will:
- Be led by design and product
- Be supported by engineering and CRM
- Be timeboxed to 1 sprint
- Involve drafting content and getting it reviewed by CAIA
- Involve learning how to implement an email
- Not include implementation
- Build on any exploration we’ve already done related to VA Notify

#### We will deliver:
- A feedback email that is ready to implement
- A spike that describes how to implement this feedback email

### Design a Power BI re-routing report
We will design a Power BI report that helps with monitoring re-routes. This can be supported by the CXDM team who will build the report. This will help us and our partners to understand and monitor reroute rates. 

#### This initiative will:
- Be led by product
- Be supported by design
- Be supported by the CXDM team who will build the report
- Be timeboxed to 1 sprint (not including CXDM building the report)
- Build off a report that Becky already has generated

#### We will deliver:
- A design for a Power BI report

### Support CRM to re-design the primary Ask VA Power BI report
We will help the CRM team to re-design the primary Ask VA Power Bi report. This can be supported by the CXDM team who will build the report. This will help us and our partners to understand and monitor varying metrics related to Ask VA. We will also gain a better understanding of which data business lines find important.

#### This initiative will:
- Be led by product
- Be in partnership with CRM and business lines
- Be supported by design
- Be supported by the CXDM team who will rebuild the report
- Be timeboxed to 2 sprints (not including CXDM re-building the report)
- Include conversations with business lines to understand which data they require

#### We will deliver:
- A design for an updated Power BI report
