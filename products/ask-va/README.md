# Ask VA VA.gov team
Ask VA (AVA) is an online portal that allows Veterans, caregivers, and supporting personnel in education, debt, loans, etc. to submit questions to VA and receive a secure message response. Currently, Ask VA  resides within a stand-alone Microsoft portal that is inconsistent with the VA design standards, is not mobile-friendly, and has accessibility issues.

Ask VA on the modernized VA.gov platform will be a digital support channel that works with other tools and features on VA.gov and VA ecosystem to quickly and accurately answer users' questions. Users should feel it is easy and intuitive to submit their issues and receive adequate updates and information that results in a final resolution. Ultimately, we want Ask VA to feel part of a cohesive and user-centered approach to support.
