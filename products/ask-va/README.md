# Ask VA VA.gov team
AVA is an online portal that allows Veterans, caregivers, and supporting personnel in education, debt, loans, etc. to submit questions to VA and receive a secure message response. Currently, Ask VA (AVA) resides within a stand-alone Microsoft portal that is inconsistent with the VA design standards, is not mobile-friendly, and has accessibility issues.

AVA on the modernized VA.gov platform will be a digital support channel that works with other tools and features on VA.gov and VA ecosystem to quickly and accurately answer users' questions. Users should feel it is easy and intuitive to submit their issues and receive adequate updates and information that results in a final resolution. Ultimately, we want AVA to feel part of a cohesive and user-centric approach to support.
