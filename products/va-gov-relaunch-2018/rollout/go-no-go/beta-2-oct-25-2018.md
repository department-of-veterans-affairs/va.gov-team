- 2 key fixes in: logging out on VA.gov destroys the cookie. Closing the browser destroys the cookie.
- Existing issue: if you sign out on MHV, and then go back to VA.gov and do any interaction, your cookie is reset for MHV. 
- New issue associated w/logging out: if you sign out on MHV, then log out on VA.gov, it recreates the cookie for MHV.

Possible affected audience:
- Must be on a public machine
- Must be logged into preview.va.gov, and then navigate to MHV
- They leave their browser open when the leave the machine
- A malicious person uses that machine within 30 min
- Data:
  - weekend days avg 20,000 users per day, vs 45,000 avg on weekdays, so still a significant amount of traffic.
  - About 5 % of Vets.gov visitors click CTA in banner
