## VA311

- Pete Smith`*`

Any concerns?

**Increase in VA311 traffic, average 600 a day before launch to 2,800 yesterday: 400% increase. Evenly distributed across options. In the event of a big spike, system can handle it, but a little concerned about contact centers - discussing that now. Had one hour when Live option was available, and 9 people chose it (w/o any prompts) and are gathering the data on that now.**
