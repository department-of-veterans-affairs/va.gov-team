# "Beta 1" Go / No Go 
## Oct 17, 2018

## Decision: No Go

---

**Contact Center not ready**
- Need to give Ryan (overseer of HRC operations) an extra day to prepare his team.
- Need to message the operators of the other phone numbers that this is coming

**Messaging to internal VA community not ready**
- Internal logistics delaying original idea of VA Veteran Employee comms
- Need a high level confidence-inducing email that we can send to Digital Modernization Council and Working Group members. May need language from Wyatt / Brian on why we’re confident we can handle the traffic.
- Need confidence-inducing one-sheeter on what we’re doing (the slow roll release), why we’re confident in the traffic handling, and the timing, to make sure we can quickly respond to any groups we haven't yet accounted for.

**Are there too many things broken?**
- There were struggles in Usability: weird jankiness, sometimes things opened in a pop-up, sometimes a button wouldn’t work, sometimes they clicked on left nav for a page they were already on bc it was highlighted, users tended to give up.
- Worried that we’ll point ppl to try a new thing and it won’t work. Could become a nightmare for Help Desk, and/or a PR kerfuffle, and/or users get stuck and can’t do the thing they came to do and can’t get back.
- We'll continue QA, but some things are hard to find w/o users themselves finding them. Plan is to continue w/"beta" and leverage the combination of moderated and unmoderated testing to keep findind and fixing both before and after Launch.

**Final Facility locator solution not ready**
- Not necessary for "beta"

**Dashboard UAT isn't fully complete**
- Tested w/Andy's dad and there was an issue, but seems to be an edge case based on further research
- Testing w/in person MHV users was generally successful, not enough to be 100% confident
- Are confident enough to not delay "beta" for this, but will continue to do UAT prior to Launch

**Login**
- SSO, big difference between Monday and Tuesday, was awesome to see it work :)
- Branding was Vets.gov: fixed now, no longer a blocker
- Pop-up blocker: 0% success, they kept clicking on left nav bc they didn't notice the refresh
- There are some stytling things in progress, and some other things we could consider to assuage.
- David and Winnie will determine if there's anything we should do prior to anticipated 10/18 "beta" release
- Side-ish note: painful to watch ppl struggle w/2-factor on ID.me signup. (Team is working to introduce intermediate screen about how 2-factor is optional).

**Teamsite**
- Additional updates not critical for "beta" launch.

**503**
- Let's not plan to use this as our incident response mechanism, instead let's use a Vets.gov informational page.

**Banner**
- Need adjusted words and CTA ready in the event we need to replace w/the Vets.gov informational page.

**Informational Page**
- Need to update text based on feedback
- Need to add homepage image
- Need to stand this page up so it's ready to go in the event of an incident
