# Overview
As part of the VA Web Brand Consolidation effort, SSO is being implemented such that users who have logged in to VA.gov will be able to seamlessly transition into My HealtheVet when attempting to access health tools. While there is a happy path for such users when they are already logged in with an account that has sufficient access rights (e.g. MHV Premium), there are several other cases that need to be handled gracefully.

# Summary
The following summarizes each tool, content page, and target page on MHV.

| Tool | Content Page | MHV Page |
|------|--------------|----------|
| My Health | N/A | https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/home |
| VA Secure Messaging | /health-care/secure-messaging/ | https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/secure-messaging |
| VA Prescription Refill and Tracking | /health-care/refill-track-prescriptions/ | https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/web/myhealthevet/refill-prescriptions |
| Schedule a VA Appointment | /health-care/schedule-view-va-appointments/ | https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/web/myhealthevet/scheduling-a-va-appointment |
| Get Your VA Medical Records Online (VA Blue Button) | /health-care/get-medical-records/ | https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/download-my-data* |
| View Your VA Lab and Test Results Online | /health-care/view-test-and-lab-results/ | https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/labs-tests |

* Note that the user will always be taken to the *Get Your VA Medical Records Online* content page, even if they are logged in.

# Approach
Each health tool will have a content landing page, such as below for Refill Prescriptions:
![Refill Prescriptions Example](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-gov-relaunch-2018/identity/images/va.gov-health-tool-content-page.png)

Specifically, the "You need to sign in..." blue box near the center can be used to handle the different states of how a user could land on this page.  In summary, the following scenarios can be encountered:
- The user clicks on a link to the health tool and is not logged in
- The user clicks on a link to the health tool, is logged in, and needs to verify their identity (not ID proofed)
- The user clicks on a link to the health tool, is logged in, but needs to upgrade their account access (ID proofed)
- The user clicks on a link to the health tool, is logged in, but VA.gov cannot create a MHV account for them
- The user clicks on a link to the health tool, is logged in, but cannot upgrade their account access
- The user clicks on a link to the health tool, is logged in, but the user is not in MVI
- The user clicks on a link to the health tool, is logged in, but the user has a disabled MHV account
- The user clicks on a link to the health tool, is logged in, but VA.gov failed to create a MHV account for them
- The user clicks on a link to the health tool, is logged in, but the user has mutliple active MHV accounts
- The user has attempted to upgrade their account access; the upgrade failed, and the user is blocked from accessing the tool
- The user has attempted to upgrade their account access; the upgrade failed, but the user may still be directed to the tool
- The user has otherwise navigated to this page, and may be logged in with access to the tool

The contents of the blue box will need to reflect the given state (and may be a different color depending on the state).

Overall however, if a user clicks on a link for a tool and does have the proper access rights for the tool, they should be taken directly to the tool.

## Not Logged In
If a user visits a health tool content landing page when they are not logged in, they should see messaging that states they need to log in with their credential in order to access the tool.

After logging in, the content landing page should display a state that explains a new tab has been opened (with a link/button to re-open the link), and the tool should open in MHV on a new tab.

## Verify Your Identity (not ID proofed)
If a user visits a health tool content landing page when they are logged in, but their account needs to be created OR upgraded to Premium, they should see messaging that states they need to verify their identity to upgrade their account and access the tool.

After successfully completing identity proofing and account upgrade, the content landing page should display a state that explains a new tab has been opened (with a link/button to re-open the link), and the tool should open in MHV on a new tab.

If the upgrade fails, then an error state should be shown.

## Upgrade Required (ID proofed)
If a user visits a health tool content landing page when they are logged in, but their account needs to be created OR upgraded to Premium, they should see messaging that states they need to accept the health tools terms & conditions in order to access the tool.

After successfully accepting the T&C, the content landing page should display a state that explains a new tab has been opened (with a link/button to re-open the link), and the tool should open in MHV on a new tab.

If the upgrade fails, then an error state should be shown.

## Upgrade Not Possible
If a user visits a health tool content landing page when they are logged in, but their account has no path to be upgraded to Premium (i.e. they have a MHV Basic account), they should see messaging that states they cannot access the tool because of their account type.

## Cannot find in MVI (Blocked)
If VA.gov attempted to find a record of the user in MVI but failed, then an error state should be shown and the user should not be allowed to proceed.

Current error text:
> We’re sorry. We can’t match your Social Security number to our Veteran records. We won’t be able to give you access to the Vets.gov health tools until we can match your information to verify your identity.
> 
> Please check the information you entered and make sure it matches the information in your records. If you feel you've entered your information correctly, and it's still not matching, please contact your nearest VA medical center. Let them know you need to verify the information in your records, and update it as needed. The operator, or a patient advocate, can connect with you with the right person who can help. 

## Disabled MHV Account (Creation Blocked)
If VA.gov attempts to create a MHV account for the user but they have a disabled MHV account, then an error state should be shown and the user should not be allowed to proceed.

Current error text:
> It looks like you’ve disabled your My HealtheVet account
> 
> We’re sorry. We can’t give you access to the Vets.gov health tools because it looks like you already have a My HealtheVet account that’s been disabled.
> 
> Please call the My HealtheVet Help Desk at 1-877-327-0022 (TTY: 1-800-877-8339), 7:00 a.m. - 7:00 p.m. (CT), and ask for help to activate your disabled account.

## MHV Account Creation Failed (Blocked)
If VA.gov attempted to create a MHV account for the user but the creation failed, then an error state should be shown and the user should not be allowed to proceed.

Current error text:
> We can’t give you access to the Vets.gov health tools right now
> 
> We’re sorry. Something went wrong on our end that’s preventing you from using the health tools right now. We’ve verified your information so you’ll be able to use tools like prescription refills and secure messaging the next time you sign in. Please try signing in later.

## Multiple Active MHV Accounts (Upgrade Blocked)
If VA.gov is attempting to upgrade a user's account to Premium but they have multiple active MHV accounts, then an error state should be shown and the user should not be allowed to proceed

Current error text:
> It looks like you have more than one My HealtheVet account
> 
> We’re sorry. We can’t give you access to the Vets.gov health tools because we’ve found more than one active account for you in the My HealtheVet system.
> 
> Please call the My HealtheVet Help Desk at 1-877-327-0022 (TTY: 1-800-877-8339), 7:00 a.m. - 7:00 p.m. (CT), and ask for help to delete any extra accounts in the system.

## Upgrade Failed (Blocked)
If the user attempted to upgrade their account type but the upgrade failed, then an error state should be shown.

Current error text:
> We can’t give you access to Vets.gov health tools right now
>
> We’re sorry. We started the process of creating the MyHealth_e_Vet account you’ll need to access the Vets.gov health tools, but something went wrong on our end before we could complete it. We’ve created your MyHealth_e_Vet account, but we still need to upgrade it to the security level needed to use tools that access your health-related information. We’re working to fix this so you can use the tools as soon as possible. Please try signing in again later.

Current boilerplate helpdesk text:
> If you think this is a mistake, please contact your VA health care team and ask them to check your prescription records. If you need more help, please call the Vets.gov Help Desk at 1-855-574-7286 (TTY: 1-800-877-8339). We’re here Monday–Friday, 8:00 a.m.–8:00 p.m. (ET).

## Upgrade Failed (Not Blocked)
This is an alternate case where we attempt to upgrade the user's account type, but the upgrade is not actually necessary; in this case, the error should be suppressed, and the user should simply be taken to the tool.

## Direct Navigation with Proper Rights
If the user has directly navigated to the health tool content landing page when they are logged in with an account that has proper access rights, the should see messaging that allows them to navigate directly to the tool.
