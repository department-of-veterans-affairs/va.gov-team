- [ ] Determine how to handle user experience for authenticated links (including hub, menu, and homepage links)
- [ ] Create new static content pages for authenticated links (if that’s the chosen design solution) - List of pages needed here: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/VA.gov%20Relaunch%202018/design/content/new-content-pages.md

#### Build new ‘Health and Benefits’ and ‘About VA’ URL schemata for VA.gov, and maximize VA.gov SEO
- [ ] Determine root URLs for each benefit hub and update URL schema for each benefit hub to reflect new benefit IA
- [ ] Update duplicative or redundant URLs on VA.gov and update to new URLs (e.g., va.gov/health  va.gov/vha)
- [ ] Audit and update all benefit hub navigation links, headings , and pages for SEO (e.g., consistency in title tags [50-60 characters] and headings, meta descriptions [50-300 characters], content design [follow proper formatting/structure for content H1-H6], etc.)

## Stretch-goal 2018 MVP work (i.e., we hope to complete this work by launch)

#### ONGOING: Audit, rewrite, and retire existing Veteran-facing benefits content on VA.gov (as deemed appropriate)
- [ ] Audit for duplicative benefits content on VA.gov for each benefit category
- [ ] Rewrite benefits content currently on VA.gov, by priority, and fit it into new benefit IA using USWDS page template
- [ ] Retire old and/or duplicative benefits content on VA.gov that’s now part of new ‘Health and Benefits’ section of VA.gov
  - Includes benefits content or links on sections of VA.gov that are not VHA, VBA, or NCA (i.e., VACO office pages)

#### Research and create new audience hubs for benefits (like the Family and Caregiver Benefits hub on Vets.gov)
These will likely use the same concept of a benefit hub-in-reverse: the official content "lives" in the respective benefit category, but we do the work for users in co-locating all of their benefit content on one page.

For Active and Transitioning Servicemembers, a new hub is also a good place to research the DOD>VA user journey and to rebuild Exxplore's benefit navigator tool.

Likely new audience benefits hubs:
- Spouses, Dependents, and Survivors (see https://explore.va.gov/spouses-dependents-survivors)
- Active and Transitioning Servicemembers (see https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/featured#service-members)
- National Guard and Reservists

## Post-MVP work (i.e., we won't get to this work until after launch)

#### CMS ~ CMS ~ CMS ~ CMS ~ CMS ~ CMS ~ CMS ~ CMS ~ CMS ~ CMS ~ CMS ~ CMS 

#### Create 'Working with VA' content hub
This will be where we put content for 1. people who help administer VA benefits (e.g., home loan officers) and 2. anyone doing business with VA (e.g., vendors).

#### Create 'VA Employee' content hub

#### Create affinity group, conditions, and service era content hubs (some benefits-related, some not)
Some examples of these groups:
- Homeless Veterans (see https://www.va.gov/homeless/)
- Women Veterans (see https://www.va.gov/womenvet/)
- Homeless Veterans (see https://www.va.gov/homeless/)
- The wounded or injured (see https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/featured#injured)
- Rural populations (see https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/featured#rural)

#### Redesign medical facilities pages
These should live under our Facilities Locator (rather than under VHA's section of the website).

#### Benefits content translations
We could consider creating a language selector pattern to toggle to translated content.


# Content Questions and Open Items

#### Significant IA Changes
Ensure SMEs are clear on the major IA changes
- [x] Health Care – review of Conditions area, new content pages
- [x] Disability – Movement of larger areas under eligibility, addition of newer items (Claim for increase, supplemental forms, dependents), About Disability Ratings section
-	[x] Education – movement of ways to use benefits, new content pages, addition of Opt out and Complaint Tool
-	[x] Housing – Homelessness content?
  - _Homeless content not part of MVP of Housing_
-	[x] Life Insurance – significant amount of VA.gov content pages, pop-ups
-	[x] Burials – restructure of spokes

#### VHA, VBA, NCA Hubs
-	[ ] For content “moving” to these hubs, what does that mean? Need to create IA for these hubs and ensure proper linking back to Benefits. Start to define guidelines and purpose of the administration hubs 
-	[x] Do we provide a single entry point to the administration hub or do we need to bubble up some of the content in the benefit hub.
  - _We will provide a single entry point to the admin hub through the right rail on the hub page.  The admins can also use the promo spot to highlight any key information._
- [ ] Audit top nav, left nav and resources right rail on current VA site.  Note which items will no longer be readily accessible from new benefit hubs. Lower priority, post URL mapping. October?


#### Crosslinking/Related Benefits – “Other VA Benefits and Services”
-	[x] Define what types of items should go in this area and what the correct label should be. Originally defined as other VA benefits the user may be interested in. Jennifer R interpreted the “Related” term to mean that they were benefits the user would be eligible for
  - _This area should remain as originally intended, for exposing core benefits and services offered by the VA.  They will generally be high level options. This will be phase one of this content area_

#### Content Changes
-	[x] How to track all pages that will need content changes because new structure and context, need to accommodate new child pages, need to include inline links to VA pages, small content additions to ensure coverage of pages that are being retired/consolidated, etc
  - _Beth and Danielle will use the content audit spreadsheet_
- [x] Determine how to handle stakeholder review and approval of changes
  - _Beth, Danielle, and Andy to work out process_
- [ ] Where do we do these changes


#### Footer, About VA
-	Areas that I have not spent significant time on

#### Benefit Menus on Sub-domains
-	[ ] what do to with them, as most may not work.  How to find them?
