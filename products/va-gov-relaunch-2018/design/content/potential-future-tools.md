## Potential future tools

This is a list of content areas the content team has identified in the course of legacy rewriting work that may benefit from a tool/wizard.

### Disability hub

| Page (link to latest version) | Potential tool/wizard | Description | Priority level: Need <br> (What's the level of complication that we'd be simplifying with this tool?) | Priority level: Use <br> (How many people are using the benefit/visiting the page/need the information?)  | Example(s) for reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |--- | 
| [About VA disability ratings - preview](https://vagov-content-pr-268.herokuapp.com/disability/about-disability-ratings/) | Combined ratings calculator | [Calculator in development](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vft-59c95ae5fda7577a9b3184f8/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/18214). Noting here just to keep everything together. | | | |
| [2019 VA disability compensation rates - preview](https://vagov-content-pr-268.herokuapp.com/disability/compensation-rates/) and sub pages | Rate wizard | Wizard that allows Veteran to input information/answer questions about: <ul><li> Disability rating/combined rating (bring in rating calculator?)</li><li>Details around loss of limbs or other serious disability that may make the Veteran eligibility for [special monthly compensation](https://vagov-content-pr-268.herokuapp.com/disability/compensation-rates/special-monthly-compensation-rates/)</li> <li>Number and type of dependents (spouse, child(ren), parent(s))</li><li>Added benefits (Aid and Attendance/Housebound allowance) for Veteran and/or spouse</li><li>Whether they're receiving military retirement pay, disability severance pay,or separation pay</li><li>Whether they're incarcerated for a felony (noting, but may want to leave out)</li><li>Whether they received a Medal of Honor</li><li>Inputs/questions to identify automobile and/or clothing allowance or birth defect compensation</li></ul> <br> We've organized this information, and added contextual instructions where relevant, to make it much easier to find one's rates. But a wizard that brings all of the different rates together could really help simplify the experience even further. Or, if it's not possible to bring everything together, even a wizard that brings together [the basics around rating/dependents/A&A](https://vagov-content-pr-268.herokuapp.com/disability/compensation-rates/veteran-rates/) and/or a wizard for [special monthly compensation](https://vagov-content-pr-268.herokuapp.com/disability/compensation-rates/special-monthly-compensation-rates/) could be very helpful.| | | <ul><li>[Hill & Ponton Disability Attorneys](https://www.hillandponton.com/va-disability-calculator/)</li><li>[Good Calculators](https://goodcalculators.com/va-disability-calculator/)</li><li>[CCK Law](https://cck-law.com/va-disability-calculator/)</li> |
 

## Burials hub

| Page (link to latest version) | Potential tool/wizard | Description | Priority level: Need <br> (What's the level of complication that we'd be simplifying with this tool?) | Priority level: Use <br> (How many people are using the benefit/visiting the page/need the information?)  | Example(s) for reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |--- | 
| [Eligibility - preview](https://vagov-content-pr-137.herokuapp.com/burials-memorials/eligibility/) | Eligibility wizard | Wizard that helps each audience (Veteran, service member, spouse, dependent child, parent) quickly find out if they qualify for burial in a VA national cemetery. In general, eligibility wizards could be helpful. But this benefit, in particular, has several different potential eligible groups and a lot of nuances within each group. | | | |
| [Parents DIC rates - preview](https://vagov-content-pr-438.herokuapp.com/burials-memorials/parent-dic-rates/#historic-rates) | Rates wizard/calculator | Wizard/calculator that allows parent to input information/answer questions about: <ul><li> Whether only one, or both, parents are alive</li><li>Whether eligible parent is living with a spouse</li><li>The parent's (and spouse's if applicable) yearly income (note: would need to include functionality and/or instructions around what counts as income)</li><li>Whether the eligible parent also qualifies for Aid and Attendance</li></ul> <br> Rate wizards/calculators would be helpful, in general. But this particular benefit requires a "rate of decrease (decrement)" calculation that complicates it even more than most. We've created step-by-step, contexual instructions to make it as easy as possible, but a wizard/calculator would be particularly helpful here. | | | |


## Life insurance hub

| Page (link to latest version) | Potential tool/wizard | Description | Priority level: Need <br> (What's the level of complication that we'd be simplifying with this tool?) | Priority level: Use <br> (How many people are using the benefit/visiting the page/need the information?)  | Example(s) for reference |

| https://insurance.va.gov/NeedsCalculator | Improvements to calculator | We are rewriting the [intro page for this tool](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vft-59c95ae5fda7577a9b3184f8/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/8439) as part of our life insurance hub rewriting/redirect work. However, the calculator itself could also benefit from UX design/PL review. | --- | --- |--- |
