| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| 9/14/2018 | For Check Your GI Bill Benefits, VA letters, VIC, 526 SSCI these pages will continue to navigate to content page, no redirect, continue to tool button. <br />Griffins owns replacing the green buttons within Vets.gov content with the blue alert box/button that is used on preview.va.gov like on MHV tools. Need to account for a new state for on-site tool.<br />Hydra owns moving this page content to preview and applying the correct treatment | Chris Johnston,  David Bao  |
| 9/14/2018 | For Claims and Appeals Status these pages will follow the special redirect handling pattern similar to MHV. No need to put an additional content page in front of them. Keep current treatment of both buttons at top and bottom. <br />Revisit treatment of buttons on subway map pages post-launch/MVP | Chris Johnston,  David Bao  |
| 9/14/2018 | For 10/9, for beta we're fine with alt users having to log in again when directed to MHV pages. David will write content that reflects the actions users have to take (log in with ID.me or DS logon, not MHV, and log in again) based on the experience that they had. **Content should reflect that they should not create a new MHV account if they have already attempted to log in using their MHV credentials.**<br />Update reflected in the Rollout Doc | Chris Johnston,  David Bao  |
| 9/14/2018 | Push back beta test of full site experience from 10/9 to 10/16 in order to have an additional week of moderated usability testing<br />Update reflected in the Rollout Doc | Chris Johnston              |
| 9/14/2018 | **No more team responsibility swaps.** It's a waste of time, resources and effort. We're running out of time to do this work and swapping resources is a waste of everyone's time. | ALL                         |
| 9/14/2018 | Transfer Teamsite Header/Footer effort to Dragons, effective immediately. De-scope search v2 as a priority for launch/MVP.<br />Update reflected in the Rollout Doc | Steve Kovacs, James Kassemi |
| 9/14/2018 | For MVP, The "My Health" link in the Header will open the home page of My HealtheVet in a new tab. | Chris Johnston, Andy Lewandowski |
| 9/17/2018 | Trevor is responsible for accessibility ONLY on VA.gov pages, VA global utilities, VA global mega menu, and VA global footer that are on the Veteran Facing Services stack (including tools built by BAH, Veracity, and AbleVets). He cannot ensure compliance of any old VA pages that we do not currently have control over. | Lauren Alexanderson, Mary O'Toole, Andrew Hughey |
| 9/17/2018 | Sign in/profile navigation scenarios <br> 1) User clicks on Sign In button in header from any page on the site - they sign in and remain on the page they were on. <br> 2) User clicks on Sign In button on home page - they sign in and remain on the home page. <br> 3) User is directed to sign in when attempting to access a tool that requires authentication (i.e. claim status or refill rx) - they sign in and are directed to the tool they were trying to access. <br> 4)  User navigates directly to /my-va before signing in - they routed to sign in and are directed to My VA page (dashboard). <br> 5)  User navigates directly to /account before signing in - they routed to sign in and are directed to Account. <br> 6)  User navigates directly to /profile before signing in - they routed to sign in and are directed to Profile. <br> 7)  User clicks on "Home" in breadcrumb from anywhere on the site - they are taken to the home page. <br> 8)  User clicks on VA logo from anywhere on the site - they are taken to the home page. <br> 9)  User clicks on My VA option in header - they are taken to the My VA page (dashboard). <br> 10)  User clicks on Profile in the header (under signed in name) - they are taken to Profile page. <br> 11)  User clicks on Account in the header (under signed in name) - they are taken to Account page. <br> 12)  User clicks on Sign Out from anywhere on the site - they are signed out and taken to the home page . | Andy Lewandowski, Mikki Northuis |
| 9/18/2018 | Search MVP is in scope for Nov 7 launch (MVP = functioning search feature, replicating Vets.gov functionality, but w/new VA branding). Search V2 deprioritized as out of scope for Nov 7 to make room for TeamSite header/footer injection work. | Andy, Chris, Steve |
| 9/18/2018 | In order to avoid breaking the form functionality while migrating from Vets.gov to VA.gov (namely form routing), we've decided to revert back to the existing Vets.gov URL structure for all of the forms. | Andy Lewandowski, Ryan Luu, Rian Fowler|
| 9/18/2018 |Login (for dependents and caregivers) - For MVP, no changes are needed to accommodate these groups. Griffin’s team will monitor any issues reported by the call center for these users and handle in future releases. | David Bao, Chris Johnston
| 9/18/2018 |DS Logon  - No changes will be made to the way users access this feature.  | David Bao, Chris Johnston
| 9/18/2018 |Login FAQ content - Updates will be made to the current login/identity FAQs to reflect new whitelabeling changes. Joe has reviewed the existing content and provided recommendations that will be implemented for MVP. (#11491)  | David Bao, Chris Johnston
| 9/19/2018 | [Confirmed with Carnetta from MHV]() that the current Vets.gov Health Tools Terms & Conditions are *not* required in VA.gov, as the health tools will not be hosted on VA.gov. Therefore, VA.gov may freely create and upgrade MHV accounts for users without asking them to accept T&C. | David Bao |
| 9/19/2018 | The "My Health" link will show up for *all* logged in users, and we will not attempt to create MHV accounts for those who do not have them for now. | David Bao, Ben Barone, Chris Johnston |
| 9/21/2018 | For links to PDFs provided by third parties (i.e., life insurance companies who provide forms for VA Life Insurance benefits), we should link to the higher level of content on VA.gov that provides contextual information and the most up-to-date PDF form. (Life insurance is the only benefit that we know of that use third-party forms.) For links to PDFs provided by VA or another government agency, we will continue to link directly to the PDF form. (No change from what we currently do.) | Andy Lewandowski |
| 9/24/2018 | For Privacy Policy, we'll get the new URL up to a page w/existing privacy content. We'll implement the new content as soon as it's approved within VA. | Chris, Melissa |
| 9/24/2018 | **Claim Status** - QA has been done and there are implementation tickets for bug fixes slated for completion no later than 10/12. Other than these, no additional changes will be made prior to WBC. We will monitor post-launch for feedback concerning dependent access and determine what changes are needed in future iterations. <br> **VA Letters** - QA complete, no changes required. Vets360 integration will be prioritized behind WBC launch <br> **526 MVP** - bug fixes to preview.va.gov version based on QA  & triage wizard implementation for full launch prior to Oct 23; 4142 integration will be implemented in Nov following WBC launch due to external dependencies | Dawn Munoz and Andrea Schneider
| 9/25/2018 | IRIS is a heavily-used system, scope for VA.gov MVP is simply to link to the existing page | Chris |
| 9/26/2018 | TeamSite header/footer injections will only occur on two page variants. The other page variants have been determined out of scope.  | Chris |
| 10/1/2018 | As we share the preview.va.gov link more widely to test the site unmoderated prior to launch, originally the plan was to limit traffic to 5,000 users. However, we have changed approach and will just let it go and leverage our "runbook" if we run into incidents. The more we can replicate the real experience, the sooner we're going to learn, and the more we can prepare for VA.gov launch. | Alex, Chris, Rachael |
| 10/11/2018 | The global alert process at VA is not a truly global process. Our requirement is that Josh Tuscher is able to put a banner on the homepage only of VA.gov and he needs to be able to do it on his own, and be able to include text styling (bold) and include a link. Ideally, when Josh puts up a banner, it would alert our content team so they can finesse the language if they want. | Chris |
| 10/11/2018 | We don't need an "on call" rep from Foresee during launch, but Jeff will notify Mychal of the launch timeline, so that he's not surprised if Steve/Jeff come to him needing help/updates urgently during that time | Steve, Jeff |
| 10/11/2018 | This teamsite implementation will remain a hardcoded structural snapshot for now. Much of the content still flows through dynamically, so we'll resolve existing style conflicts with current approach. Post-launch we'll look at re-factoring the header both for purposes of improving injection and also for giving a workable component to Teamsite to include directly. | Chris |
| 10/12/2018 | Master root sitemap including preview.va.gov AND previous www.va.gov pages / subdomains should be indexed pre-launch. Setting priority on these two separate sitemaps is a post-launch task. | Chris, Steve |
| 10/22/2018 | Foresee button does not need custom CSS, no further implementation work needed on Vets.gov to drive traffic towards the button to increase responses - the pilot ends Nov 7 and we have what we need. Additionally, we have enough information from the flyout (button) survey on the old www.va.gov, so Jeff is connecting with Josh Tuscher to have it removed from all va properties. | Chris, Jeff |
| 10/26/18 | I was able to sit down with @chrisj-usds this morning and clarify what pages the new header/footer is expected to be on injected on. Here is the list: **1.** Any www.va.gov page that uses teamsite **2.** benefits.va.gov pages **3.** cem.va.gov pages **4**. www.choose.va.gov pages | Chris |
| 10/26/18 |**1**. Global alerts always show below the global header **2**. For the VA.gov homepage, the order of alerts is (1.) global alert and then (2.) homepage alert(s) | Andy Lewandowski |
| 10/26/18 | Preview.va.gov should be deprecated after launch. | Chris, James |
| 10/29/18 | We will merge the launch PR(s) at 5:30 PM ET, so the new site is launched around 6:00 PM ET on Nov 7. This is instead of the previously planned 12:00 PM ET timing, to minimize the risk of huge amounts of traffic if there are issues. We are confident in conversation with ALex L that NSOC/ITOPS and other necessary support can be available at that later time, and on 24/7 on call notice, the only risk is that Call Center will likely not be available to answer calls from users. | Chris, James, Rachael |
| 10/29/18 | **Phone Numbers:** **1. Formerly the Vets.gov Help Desk** This number shouldn’t appear anywhere on VA.gov: 1-855-574-7286 **2. MyVA311** This global contact number replaces the Vets.gov Help Desk number. It will be the main contact number for VA.gov and will serve as the routing system to all the call centers. Here's the Andy-approved messaging: “Call MyVA311 for help: 1-844-698-2311. If you have hearing loss, call TTY: 711.” **3. The HRC number** This should appear on pages that have forms already supported by HRC. **4. Ask Questions (formerly "Contact Us") sidebar** The new content hubs will highlight the appropriate contact information for each benefit page. The numbers will be listed in order of most-related to the benefit outlined on the hub page, to the broadest number available (MyVA311). NOTE: We’re leaving the Ask a Question as an option because it receives such high traffic. | Chris, Rachael, HRC, Lacey, Aubrey |
| 9/18/2018 <br><br> update: 10/29/2018 <br><br> **FINAL DECISION: 10/31/18** | RULE: Any link that does not contain VA.gov should open in a NEW tab. EXCEPTION: veteranscrisisline.net opens in the SAME tab. RATIONALE: We want to be sure that Veterans get to this page, especially on mobile, so replacing the current page is the correct behavior. // RULE: Any link that contains va.gov should open in the same tab. EXCEPTION: The following URLs open in a NEW tab: myhealth.va.gov(My HealtheVet), ebenefits.va.gov (eBenefits), www.accesstocare.va.gov, www.gibill.va.gov/wave/, https://www.blogs.va.gov/, https://www.data.va.gov/, https://mobile.va.gov/, https://www.accesstocare.va.gov/, https://www.oit.va.gov/ | Mikki Northuis, Andy Lewandowski <br><br> update: Chris Johnston |
| 11/1/2018 | For the immediate term (i.e. for Nov 7 Launch), on teamsite subdomains, we leave the Sign-in button as is. Clicking that button will take you to va.gov/my-va. Teamsite subdomains will never actually show or retain a logged-in state | Chris Johnston |
| 11/5/2018 | Melissa is the POC for monitoring feedback and social listening, and Clare and Melissa will coordinate a daily report-out on trends from those for Launch week. | Chris, Clare, Jeff, Melissa |
