## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the new design for VA's main website, va.gov. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a working prototype.** Some of the links or features may not be availble yet.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

*Start recording.*



## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 3 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Have you visited any VA webistes in the past? What was your reason for visiting?

  > Yes. I use ebenefits for payouts for gi bill and disability and mhv to communicate quicker w/my doctor. 

- Do you have your account information for MyHealtheVet, DS Logon, or ID.me?

  > Yes, I have [my account for mhv].



## Zero Task: Homepage - 7 Minutes

- This is the new homepage for va.gov, what are your first impressions? 

  > It's easier to navigate bc everything is broken down. I like that it’s layout more user friendly. Easier to get where you go. Even requesting dd2 is right there vs. 20 links. It’s user friendly.



## MyHealtheVet

### First Task: Check your appointment - 5 minutes

You are getting ready to visit your local VA Medical Center, but first you want to check that your appointment has not been cancelled. Where would you go to do this? 



### Second Task: Message Doctor - 5 minutes

During your appointment, your doctor said if you have questions, you can go online to send them a message. How would you do this on the site?

> I would go right to healthcare, schedule view, click on it; it looks like it’s the first thing you can do online. Schedule, cancel, and if you need to talk to somebody right then. Cancel without having to call – I like that option.
>
> I would sign in and create an account. Sign in with MHV…
>
> It already has my username and Id saved…so for myself I would have to contact help desk bc it doesn’t come up with the username even though I know that’s it. It doesn’t connect to my account.  **she tries again but it doesn't work** 
>
> No. I usually access through the backend of ebenefits bc I’m doing multiple things at once. 
>
**/Prompted to go back to hp/**



### Third Task: Check Vitals Data - 5 minutes

A few days after your appointment, you want to go back and see what your blood pressure was at your last appointment, where would you go to see this information?



## DS Logon

### First Task: Check your status - 5 minutes

You want to see if there have been any updates to the disability claim you filed last month, where would you go on the site?

>  Click on Disability and sign in or create an account. **/she tries to sign in/** 

> And of course it’s been long enough I have to change my password.  **/she tries to change DS logon pswd/** 
>
> I like it has an extra precaution. I’m the worst at remembering to change your password, so I like that it gives you extra /referring to 2FA/…and it’s really quick, I got the text message. 
>
> I see I have a closed claim from 2016 and a 2015 one. Can click on my status and see. **/asked about info she sees/**
>
> No, it's not accurate. There are  /[2 things]/ not listed on here. 

### Second Task:  Upload Evidence - 5 minutes

VA responded to your claim and requested that you add an additional supporting document online, where would you go to add it?

> I would go back from the main page. Go back. But first would click on dropdown, disability, and looks like I can upload right there . I can file supplemental, share medical records, go to ebenefits to upload evidence. 

> I would go to ebenefits. Of course I have to relog in, and I don’t like that. Wish it were directly connected. 

> I like vets.gob doesn’t make you click that stupid box. 

>  So once here /welcome page/ I would have to go to my disability… looks like VA.gov was going faster than ebenefits… I would have to go to… **/scrolling/** I forget where to go to upload. 

>  See, I would have to do some digging to upload the actual documents. I’ve done everything by a VSO or …

### Third Task: Check payment history - 5 minutes

Your bank's website is not showing the amount of your last payment from VA. Where would you go to find this information?

> What payment? Disability, education? 
>
> **/Education/**
>
> Going from homepage, I see View your payment history under Education. It has me log in to ebeneiftis, so do that. Since I’m already logged in, I can look at… my payment history and… it lets me know I have a reoccurring comp payments… my last 2, 3 months. I can look at return payments. 9 out of 10, if it doesn’t show, I’d have to call, but I’ve never had something not show after the 1st of month. 



## ID.me

### First Task: Check your status - 5 minutes

You want to see if there have been any updates to the disability claim you filed last month, where would you go on the site?



### Second Task:  GI Bill - 5 minutes

You are thinking about going back to college and want to know if you have any money left on your GI Bill, where would you go to check?

> Go to Benetfits, sign in. **/signs in with DS Logon/ ** 

>  I wouldn’t want it every time **/refers to reauthentication 2FA/**  but I like that it’s quick.  So I like that it did a quick popup but goes right back instead of opening a new window. It says I have x months, how many months I have left… I like that. 

### Third Task: Veteran ID - 5 minutes

You want to get an ID that proves you are a Veteran, where would you go to get it?



## Follow-up as needed.

- What other VA services would you like to explore?

  > School enrollment, if I was a current student. It looks like there’s an option – for changing school. Super easy layout, don’t have to click on 10 links to get to where you need to go. I like that. 
  >
  > **/asked about the left nav/**
  >
  > Definitely easier, looks like the more benefits I have, would be easier to navigate with direct links and different ways to get the links. 

- Where would you go on the site if you were in crisis?

  > Go to the homepage and then I don’t see anything on – in any of the 4 boxes – I would go to about va, va organizations,maybe call one of them. **/clicks to About VBA page/** Also maybe submit a health option or use the call in option to see if I’m missing something I don’t directly see.
  >
  > **/Prompted to click on Crisis Line widget/**
  >
  > I like that it says veterans themselves. It even says press 1 when you call, I like that. Confidential chat, I like that. And more resources. 

- What do you think of the faces on the homepage?

  > relatable, different branches, ages,ethnicities, genders, you know it’s  been someone whos been in the service with you. 
  >
  > **/Asked about homepage/** 
  >
  > I like the layout, gives you chance to see life insurance, memorial, house loans… I like it’s more user friendly than ebenefits. And like it has a nother option for the crisis line. I actually like the navigation is really easy, broken down into parts, and can scroll down for records, life insurance, more. 
  >
  > **/Asked about dashboard?/**  
  >
  > Go to records? Am I right? Because I have a # 4. I have to log in again. I hate that it takes me back to ebenefits. I like that it gives you the links to it… always have problem finding it through ebenefits. 100 links. So looks like once I get to ebenefits, I have to find it here. 
  >
  > **/Asked how to log out/**
  >
  > I would scroll up and click on name and sign out. I expected a page refresh to let me know to sign back in, but...

- Did you notice the links on the left side of the page (Left nav in hubs)? Woudl that be useful to you?



## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- How did that compare to your past experiences with VA websites?

  > That one was more user friendly. Requesting x through ebenefits is always a few minutes. Disability stuff is relatively easy vs. logging into almost 3 different sites. All in one stop, so I do like that. The ease of it. Not overly, technology overload, looks easy for somebody older than me.

- If this website went live tomorrow, what would you want other Veterans to know?

  > That is’ more user friendly.  I work with veterans and we were talking about ebenefits, and it’s just not user friendly. It’s hard to tell ppl where to go on that website. With this, 'hey, go to those 4 boxes.' 

- Do you have any questions for me?

  > when is this going live? Me and my husband are both vets, so we both have the same disgruntled feelings about ebenefits, this makes life just a little easier. I see with older veterans…they’re not computer savvy, so ebenifits is very overwhelming, clicking for hours.
