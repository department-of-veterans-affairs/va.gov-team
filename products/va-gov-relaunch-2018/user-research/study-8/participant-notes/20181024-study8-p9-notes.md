## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the new design for VA's main website, va.gov. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a working prototype.** Some of the links or features may not be available yet.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

*Start recording.*



## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 3 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Have you visited any VA websites in the past? What was your reason for visiting? 
  - Yes. eBenefits and I forget the name of the other one offhand. 
  - Yes. Look up information for benefits. Look up my disability letter and sometimes research on appointments and results from those appointments and medications. 
  - *So the other site that you used was a health site for your information.* Say that again. I said it looks like you used a health site for your appointments and information.* oh, MHV, MHV. 
- Do you have your account information for MyHealtheVet, DS Logon, or ID.me? 
  - I think so. Do I need to log in? Yeah we may try to do that during this session.* ok. 




## Zero Task: Homepage - 7 Minutes

- This is the new homepage for va.gov, what are your first impressions?  
  - So this is what you'll see. You're viewing the page. Its pretty simple and straight forward. 
- What do you think about the way that its laid out?
  - I think its fine. So using myself as an example, I don't typically, well, prescriptions, I see that thats easy, disability, check your claim/appeal, thats very important. Ok, thats very important and then records. Download your benefit letters. Thats one i'm often looking for. Ok, it looks good. 
- Ok, ok. Is there anything that you don't like about it?
  - no. 

## Zero Task: Login

- How would you log in to your account?
  - Normally i'd look up to the top right where it says sign in. 
  - Ok, so this is va.gov. oh, different options, alright so let's see. I'm looking up my log in. [user looks up MHV login off screen and begins login process]. Ohh so I don't know which email address is connected to that, so let's see. [after inputting MHV login, taken to screen to connect MHV to ID.me. thinks this screen is asking which email is connected to MHV account, not to connect to ID.me, confused by this step.
- What do you think this screen is trying to do?
  - it's trying to allow me to log in but it's verifying via my email. [navigates to privacy policy] 
- [On privacy policy screen] if you could tell me what you think as you're looking through this page.
  - So i'm reading through the vets.gov privacy policy to see what they're stating what is the privacy policy associated with this site and it's important it says [reads from page] we will not require you to register or provide personal information in order to visit vets.gov, but it may require personal information to be granted access to certain areas. So ok. [scrolls through page] ok. Ok. 
- *what do you think about that policy?
  - i'm somewhat familiar with the privacy act so i'm fine with the privacy. ok, so it's going to track certain things and it wants to use cookies. so thats really good they give you a lot of information about what you're doing so it eliminates questions and concerns so alright so [goes back to account verification screen, enters email, begins verification process] alright let me read this. [walks through verifications steps] thats pretty involved. 
- Yeah, what do you think about that process you just went through?
  - I thought it was pretty cool, but thats my perspective because I tend to read everything. 



## MyHealtheVet

### First Task: Check your appointment - 5 minutes

You are getting ready to visit your local VA Medical Center, but first you want to check that your appointment has not been cancelled. Where would you go to do this? 

- so from this page lets see. so i'm going to look through under health care [zone 1] schedule and view your appointment [clicks link, goes to new page, scrolls down] view your VA appointments online [clicks on link to MHV] go to MHV. it tells me we are updating your VA appointments information so I can check update [clicks update button, page refreshes] ok, so i don't any current appointments scheduled. 
- Oh I have a question, at the top left, it says that i'm premium, do you know what that means? 
  - *What do you think it means?* 
    - I don't know. 
  - *Do you have any idea what it would be about?* 
    - No, I haven't see that before. 
  - *Ah, ok.* Oh I can click on it and it can tell me. 
    - Oh that answered that, ok. Thank you. 



### Second Task: Message Doctor - 5 minutes

During your appointment, your doctor said if you have questions, you can go online to send them a message. How would you do this on the site?

- oh i remember that was he blue button button but I don't remember where that is, so lets go back to health care. [goes to health care hub] so I went under health care and i'm looking for how to contact my health care provider. [scrolls through hub] and i remember we used to have to go to the blue button and we could send a message but I don't know where that is. so there is telehealth but I don't think thats the same thing. so i'm going to keep looking just for a second here. ok so i think i found it [reads link] "Use VA secure messaging" under manage your health [scrolls through page to find messaging, mouses over link] no that's for the crisis line. [reads content] alright so I have to go to MHV. so i found the right location where to send a message, i just have to figure out how so it says compose a message. 



### Third Task: Check Vitals Data - 5 minutes

A few days after your appointment, you want to go back and see what your blood pressure was at your last appointment, where would you go to see this information?

- Ok so I'm going to come out of here and try this [navigates directly on MHV] wrong one. I'm looking under personal information. So I used to go back to MHV [goes to MHV homepage] ok this is the page that i'm a little more familiar with. So I want to see the results [mouses over boxes on MHV homepage] so I'm looking under each of the big blue boxes. Ok, health records, medical reports. But you said he did a lab test. So I click on labs and tests and then theres the information there where I can click on it and check it. I can also click on updates.

### Second Task:  Upload Evidence - 5 minutes

### Third Task: Veteran ID - 5 minutes

You want to get an ID that proves you are a Veteran, where would you go to get it?



## Follow-up as needed.

- What other VA services would you like to explore? 
  - [RECORDS] So normally we'd go to records [click s on "Download your benefit letters"] ok, so you have to sign in. Is that because I'm not signed in that I have to sign in again?
    - *Why do you think that you would need to sign in again?* 
      - We clicked out completely, so I have to sign back in then because... [goes through sign in process again, gets SAML error] unable to process S-A-M-L request. So, I'm in, it shows me. [reloads page] so I'm back in or at least I don't think it will. Should I come out completely?
    - *Yeah, lets go ahead and close this one again, i'm sorry.*
      -  no, no problem. [moderator has participant reload website and attempt to log in again]
    - *ok so from here click log out in the top right. ok and then close that pop up. now let's try it again...* [participant logs back in using MHV]
      - Ok, [goes back to records page, page requires DS logon] alright that is...
  - [EDUCATION] Alright, one more. [Clicks on "Check your Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits" [page loads] ok, well this is the prototype. So will I be able to use this once we're done, or no? 
    - *You will be able to use this once it goes live, which will be next month.* 
      - Ok, I will, well where do we go. 
  - [DASHBOARD] where would you go to find your dashboard of information about you?
    - Oh I used to go to eBenefits or MHV. 
      - *Where would you go on this site?*
        - So I would go home. [goes to homepage from breadcrumbs] i'd go back here and I would search from this page. 
      - *Where would you go to find your dashboard of information about you?*
        - Oh I used to go to eBenefits or MHV. 
      - *Where would you go on this site?*
        - So I would go home. [goes to homepage from breadcrumbs] i'd go back here and I would search from this page. What exactly am I looking for?
      - *You're looking for a dashboard of your information--information that VA has about you.*
        - Oh so typically My VA, my profile. [clicks My VA] I didn't understand your question. 
      - *No thats no problem.* 
        - So this is where I would go.
      - *What do you think about this page?* 
        - Ooh I need to change that--thats really old. [clicks on phone number, edits information] that number doesn't really work but people don't really know how to reach me there, it doesn't  transfer. I'm glad you asked this question. 
      - *But go ahead and lets update this information. I don't want you to have the wrong information.* 
        - that's great thank you. ok that works and [scrolls]
      - *is this information accurate?* [referring to military service information]
        - No, that's not right. How do I update my military service information? [reads content aloud] that dates way wrong the...ok i'll have to [reads content] but my DD214 is correct, but those dates are both wrong. 
      - *What is wrong with those dates, are those dates both wrong?*
        - I guess, so they should say august 1st 2009 that may be an error but the December 1986 is totally wrong I came into the military on delayed entry in February. I came into active duty on 7/20/84. I did 4 years and then I was ROTC then I came back in on May 8, 198--no 1993. 
      - *So what dates would you expect to see here? Like all those different periods?*
        - Well if its military service it should show the prior enlisted times and then when I came back in as an officer those dates, so. 
        - *[Asks about logging out] ok, ok that's good to know. Where would you go on the site to log out of your account.* 
          - The other thing I want to know and I don't know if this is by design, but typically they'll include your rank and thats not on this page anywhere. 
        - *Yeah, good point.* 
          - So whatever your final rank was, I would think that that would be included. If you're a veteran and you have USAA and you have Navy Federal or Pentagon Federal Credit Union or any of the credit unions they typically list your rank. I'm sorry, you had another question. 
  - [LOG OUT] *no this is good information. I was asking you where you would go on the site if you wanted to log out of your account.*
    - I'd go up to the top right probably where my name is, hit the drop down arrow and sign out. 
  - [MY VA] don't click on that yet, let's do one more thing before we look at that. what do you think would happen if you clicked on the My VA text just above your mouse.* 
    - I don't really know. It would maybe bring up my profile but that's where I am now. Can I click on it?
      - *Yeah, go ahead.* 
        - Ok, so the My VA page is a personalized place to quickly locate whatever you're looking for. That's good. 
      - *Is this what you were expecting?*
        - I didn't have any expectation because I had no idea what would be under the different tabs. 
      - *What do you think would happened if you clicked on the one that said my health?*
        - I would think that it would bring up the information that would give my access to my health records. So i'll try it [Clicks My Health]. Goes to MHV] Ok so that takes me back to the MHV page. 
      - *Ok, what do you think about that?*
        - That works. But so how do I get back to the My VA page from here?
      - *Yeah, that's a good question, what would you do if I wasn't here?*
        - I would do a back arrow however, it doesn't allow you to do that. 
      - *Where on the screen would you look for that?*
        - Well, you can click on VA, but what I really want to do is go back to the page we were on because that was a great page. 
      - *What you just did when you clicked on my health is it opened another tab in the top of your browser, do you see that? So now you have them both open.* 
        - Oh. So what would be ideal is if we had access to this little My Va and my health that way we can click interchangeably to find the information. It seems like what you guys are doing is trying to train people where to look for the information and if these 2 tabs are available you always know where to click. 
  - *Alright was there anything else on the site that you wanted to take a look at? I know you were looking through some of the records stuff and some of the other things.* 
    - So that gives me another question. So I'm going to try home, so let's see. [browses education in zone 1] i'm just looking through to see if there's anything in particular. Nope. Chip Harmon has left the meeting. No, I think this is, I think i'm ok. 
- Where would you go on the site if you were in crisis? 
- What do you think of the faces on the homepage? 
- Did you notice the links on the left side of the page (Left nav in hubs)? Would that be useful to you?



## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- How did that compare to your past experiences with VA websites?
  - This was not bad at all. If I understand what you guys are doing or at least what I take away from it is you're trying to get veterans one place to go. we had eBenefits, mhv, and the main VA site and it was up tot he veteran to figure out what site to go to to find information and if you're consolidating that information to one primary site it would be great and if we could have access to those my va and my health tabs that would be great too 
- If this website went live tomorrow, what would you want other Veterans to know
  - I would want other veterans to know that the site is available, that its been refreshed, and a little information about My VA and My Health. Otherwise they have to figure it out for themselves and if they are used to going to the my va side, MHV, or eBenefits that my create confusion and consternation as opposed to an understanding that you're intentionally simplifying the process to obtain veteran information. 
- Do you have any questions for me? 
  - Am I correct in my assessment in the intent behind this or what is the intent?
    - *Yes so the intent is that veterans will be able to go to VA.gov and they will be able to access all of their information like you would say they wouldn't have to log into eBenefits, they wouldn't have to log into all those other sites, we're sort of consolidating all of those other sites into one place.* 
  - Ok so what i'm looking at right now will be the new VA.gov so when I go to VA.gov this is what is going to come up?
    - *yes...*
  - Then again, this looks great and if you can have access to My VA and My Health tabs that would simplify the process and help the vets find what they're looking for.
