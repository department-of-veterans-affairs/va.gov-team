## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the new design for VA's main website, va.gov. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a working prototype.** Some of the links or features may not be availble yet.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

*Start recording.*



## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 3 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Have you visited any VA webistes in the past? What was your reason for visiting?

  > Use MHV occasionally. Very occasionally go to evet.gov. Several times a month go to MHV. I don't think I have [heard of vets.gov].

- Do you have your account information for MyHealtheVet, DS Logon, or ID.me?



## Zero Task: Homepage - 7 Minutes

- This is the new homepage for va.gov, what are your first impressions? 

  > My first comment is on the top, the line says ...'iteratively' and I don't know what that is. Most vets aren't gonna now what that word means. 
  >
  > /scrolls/
  >
  > It's okay as far as it goes. Hard to tell by looking at it.  I don't really have strong comments one way or the other. Is this going to replace the current VA.gov? I haven't been on va.gov much to know how different this is. 
  >
  > /prompted to open va.gov in new tab/
  >
  > Okay, I can do that. 
  >
  > /scrolls and toggles between two tabs/
  >
  > Um... don't see a whole lot difference in content. Maybe looks like it's a little easier to read the new one. It does seem a little bit easier to read, font may be a little bigger. Little better organized. 



## MyHealtheVet

### First Task: Check your appointment - 5 minutes

You are getting ready to visit your local VA Medical Center, but first you want to check that your appointment has not been cancelled. Where would you go to do this? 

> /he opens new tab/
>
> I would go straight to mhv and log in. 
>
> /prompted to start from preview/
>
> /clicks schedule... signs in/ 
>
> Do I need to log in? 
>
> /login steps/
>
> Want me to click continue then? 
>
> /clicks and goes throughID.me steps, reads page/
>
> Should I go back to where I was? Do I have to log in here? /back on login modal/
>
> /re-logs in, gets 2FA steps/
>
> /lands back on va.gov appointment page/
>
> So that's what we just did? Okay. 
>
>

### Second Task: Message Doctor - 5 minutes

During your appointment, your doctor said if you have questions, you can go online to send them a message. How would you do this on the site?

> I would go to secure messaging unless there's a new way. /clicks, lands on VA Secure Messaging page/
>
> No, that's not what i expected. I thought I was going to see what I saw on MHV screen. This is telling me that MHV is going to open in a new tab. That tells me right now that I'm going to leave the va.gov site. 
>
> /prompted to click button/
>
> So now that took me to where I was expecting to go the first time. It got me here in one more step but it wasn't clear that that was going to go here. I expected to go here the first time when I clicked Secure Messaging. 
>
> I wasn't logged in already? What do you mean? Logged in to VA.gov? The VA is VA, to me, a vet, VA is VA. Secure messaging is secure messaging, it's all VA, what's the purpose of the extra step? 

### Third Task: Check Vitals Data - 5 minutes

A few days after your appointment, you want to go back and see what your blood pressure was at your last appointment, where would you go to see this information?

### First Task: Check your status - 5 minutes

You want to see if there have been any updates to the disability claim you filed last month, where would you go on the site?

> /scrolls left nav on secure messaging va.gov page/
>
> Seems like Appeals, seems like the only... /clicks/
>
> That link could be a little more obvious. It said Appeals and Claims. Because they're 2 different things, to me. Claim is something i file the first time, and appeal is something after I've received a decision I didn't like. If I'm looking for a claim, I gotta connect claims to appeals. 
>
> When I click the back arrow, it didn't go back did it? 
>
> /asked about green button/ 
>
> I don't see a green arrow, maybe I missed it. 
>
> All the link said was appeals. Or did it say appeals and claims?  So I don't have any appeals that I know of. I just got claims. One thing that would be helpful is some place that shows or says what my current percentage is. Right now the only way i know to do that is i have to hunt down my paper claims from VA, find the last form to see what the percentage is. 
>
> /prompted to scroll down for his appeal history/
>
> Let me see if...I'm on the...is this going to be like the same thing i have in paper form? 
>
> /claim form loads for a long time/
>
> /scrolls his compensation claim info/ 
>
> None of this stuff means anything to me. I wouldn't know what to do with this information. 
>
> /prompted to scroll to the top for profile/
>
> /prompted about My VA button/
>
> /he clicks on it, lands on My VA page, clicks on claim/
>
> I guess, I never, is this a new link or something? What is the plan to go on there? Might be helpful to have -- check secure messages, go straight from here to sending a secure message right from here, prescriptions. I haven't used scheduling appointments online yet. 
>
> /scrolls/
>
> All the stuff looks helpful to have as long as you don't have to log into another website for each one. 
>
> /prompted about profile button/
>
> Not sure I understand the question. [difference between My VA vs. profile] I'm not sure what you're asking. What could be helpful to me is is there a way to change my address and my phone number through the website.
>
> /prompted to go to profile/
>
> /reads modal/
>
> This part of the process can be a real pain - changing addresses and phone number. This seems like dealing with the VA, anytime you change address and phone number, it doesn't change everywhere. Here's an example. It shows a work phone number but we haven't had that number in 9 years! 
>
> /deletes work #/
>
> That was an accidental find. What i dont see is my wife's phone number, emergency contact #. 
>
> /prompted to return to hp/
>
>



### Second Task:  Upload Evidence - 5 minutes

VA responded to your claim and requested that you add an additional supporting document online, where would you go to add it?



### Third Task: Check payment history - 5 minutes

Your bank's website is not showing the amount of your last payment from VA. Where would you go to find this information?



## ID.me

### First Task: Check your status - 5 minutes

You want to see if there have been any updates to the disability claim you filed last month, where would you go on the site?



### Second Task:  GI Bill - 5 minutes

You are thinking about going back to college and want to know if you have any money left on your GI Bill, where would you go to check?



### Third Task: Veteran ID - 5 minutes

You want to get an ID that proves you are a Veteran, where would you go to get it?



## Follow-up as needed.

- What other VA services would you like to explore?

- Where would you go on the site if you were in crisis?

  > There's a crisis line button at the top. 
  >
  > /prompted to click and read info/ 
  >
  > I don't have this issue, so not for me, but there are several diff ways to talk to somebody. When this page goes live, where's that button going to be? 

  /prompted to find his profile on hp/

  > I guess through clicking on my first name. Either My VA or account. Actually this is a timely session because in a couple of weeks, i will be moving. How am I going to get ALL of them to know that that's changed? So that will also update my VA reocords for my disability payments? 

- What do you think of the faces on the homepage?

- Did you notice the links on the left side of the page (Left nav in hubs)? Woudl that be useful to you?



## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- How did that compare to your past experiences with VA websites?

  > Um...seems like a lot more information available than I realized before. I've only used MHV for refilling prescription and secure messages to my provider, and downloaded my medical records. That's helpful. If there's a problem, it's that there's so much on there, I can spend all day hunting down on all the various VA websites. A lot of the vets I know don't even know about MHV and that's one of the hands sites I go to for the VA. I'd like to get that word out to more people, get a huge load off the medical centers. 

- If this website went live tomorrow, what would you want other Veterans to know?

  > One, that if you change your address and phone number, that you can check on your claims, right online. It's pretty cryptic information. And I'would venture 80% of vets don't know the system and are intimidated by it. I don't even go on the VA because of that. 

- Do you have any questions for me?

  > I don't think so. Can't tell if this is a VA or military record issue. Coule months ago, I sent a form requesting update to dd214. I was already out by the time I was entitled to it, and I haven't heard anything. is that VA or DOD issue? 
  >
  > What my question is --since I"m moving is if they send me a response, they might not have my new address. 
  >
  > /assisted to go to Records in nav/
