## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the new design for VA's main website, va.gov. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a working prototype.** Some of the links or features may not be availble yet.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

*Start recording.*



## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 3 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Have you visited any VA webistes in the past? What was your reason for visiting? 

  > Yes. MHV and ebenefits. On mhv, yes, but ebenefits was a bit of a hassle. /on MHV/ I was looking to make some prescription requests. /on ebenefits/ I know what I was TRYING to do but it took me... a whole process. I was seeking a specific benefit... it was assistance for poor vets, like a pension. 

- Do you have your account information for MyHealtheVet, DS Logon, or ID.me? 

  > Yes. /MHV/



## Zero Task: Homepage - 7 Minutes

- This is the new homepage for va.gov, what are your first impressions?  

  > Well, it is readable and /scrolling/ and anything, immediataely gives me visibility on different things I can do. Health care, disability, education, looks like a mixture of mhv and ebenefits. Because down on the records part, a lot of things I can do, looks very easy to do. Because previously you had to go to the hospital, wait, ... looks very thorough. A lot that I can do on this. 
  >
  > /where wyould you sign in?/
  >
  > Usually somewhere at the top. I see a sign in, but it's not as bold as it has been before. As soon as I turn on the screen /.../. What's the difference between sign in and log in. Sign in is if you don't have an account, log in is when you already have an account.
  >
  > /prompted to sign in/
  >
  > /goes through sign in steps for mhv/
  >
  > It's not automatic on your website 
  >
  > /referring to username and password fill/
  >
  > I'm having problems here. It won't accept my... 
  >
  > /username confusion/
  >
  > /screen reader - error message - did not find account/
  >
  > That is my account. I hope they're not making me change. It won't accept it. Doggone it. No, this is for VA. 
  >
  > /prompted to close sign in window/
  >
  > /back on sign on modal - try DS logon/ 
  >
  > /propmted to try ebenefits credentials/
  >
  > /errors out/
  >
  > It won't accept my DS logon. Let's try mhv again. 
  >
  > /goes to MHV option, copy/pastes/
  >
  > /still errors out/
  >
  > /goes through ok - lands on 2fa/
  >
  > /enters 2fa code and continues/
  >
  > Okay, vets.gov. 
  >
  > /lands back on va.gov hm/

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- How did that compare to your past experiences with VA websites?

  > It really looks like it's going to be easy. I have comptuer skills, this new website is good for ppl who are not all that computer savvy. It makes things a lot easier, explains things a little bit more, I'd say it's thorough, I like the interface. It really gets down to business as soon as you go to the page. It doesn't waste your time. 

- If this website went live tomorrow, what would you want other Veterans to know

  > It's very accessible, user friendly, and has a lot more resources for veterans, and veteran questions. I would tell my vets, don't be afraid to go on. This one is very easy. Some vets get flustered when they click all over the website. 

- Do you have any questions for me? 

  > Not really, I see a lot of things that i can start doing right now. You're going to find a lot of success with this one.
