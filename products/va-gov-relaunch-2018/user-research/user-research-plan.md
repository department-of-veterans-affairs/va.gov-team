# User Research Plan - for merger work

*Note: In the ever present debate about the need for formative vs summative user research, we are leveraging the research done to create the various websites (vets.gov, explore.va.gov, MHV, etc) as the formative stage. We are focused on evaluating and validating key questions and prototypes to move the merger project forward.*

## Study 1

## August - September Study Planning Notes
- will navigation it perform on mobile? will they be able to navigate easily? needs to be in person on mobile devices. we can use preview link. does the mega-menu still make sense when its collapsed down into an accordian. can they quickly and easily find things. 

Priorities
- should we split the Study 5 group desktop/mobile or do 2 studies?

Homepage
- with all the content do people actually see the links on the HP?
- How does a user going to About VA play out with the top nav and getting back
- get some feedback on the "view all" where the get to the hub and drill into content
- how do they interact with the mega menu? can they find things that arent in there.
- make a payment in HC, education forms might be good examples.
- pictures of Veterans in the ribbon.

Risk - is the mega menu going to work for VA teamsite pages? may screengrab and build out some of these pages as a backup.
Risk - cant do much live testing on the hub pages until everything is really hooked up

- mobile footer as well (in a task). 
- VCL is a top priority, we need to make sure this works on mobile, can they find this easily. 
- placement of hub page right rail content on mobile. is this content important to them?

Tree tests - More in-depth testing on the content of each hub
- burials
- education
- health

Menu, HP, Hub
qualitative approach for pension/records/disability issue.

accessibility research - reach out to a11y folks. readers and cognitive aspects. we've added a lot of volume to content and making navigation more difficult. work with Trevor Pierce. 
- plan a study to see the editor workflow through GH or Teamsite. talk to content editors and identify the pain points in their current workflow.

**A running list of things to research, test, or pay attention to:**

These items have come up in conversation with stakeholders and internally with the team.

- The use of Veteran images at the bottom of the homepage and benefit hub pages
- Where users expect to see their name (i.e., in the account navigation or on the account homepage, or both)
- The color and spacing between footer headings and links
- Use of the word "pay" vs. "compensation"
- Use of the word "VA" as an adjective (i.e., VA health care vs. health care)
- The efficacy of adding a gray lock icon to authenticated links in the mega menu and benefit hubs
- How family members, caregivers, and other "delegates" think of the Veteran-facing content and tasks (i.e., does it apply to them? do they act/read on behalf of the Veteran?)
