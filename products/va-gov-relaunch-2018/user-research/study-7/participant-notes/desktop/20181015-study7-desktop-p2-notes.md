Great, thank you!
  - You guys have my appeal. I was going to join the RAMP program but [... didn't hear]. It's been 3 years.


Before we start, a few things to mention:

- This should only take about 15 to 20 minutes
- We appreciate your open feedback so please tell us your honest opinion
- We are taking notes and recording this session, but we will not use your name in association with these records
- Please take a moment to read this informed consent document, if you agree please sign, print your name, and date the form.

## Warm-up - 3 min

Before we look at the new website, could you please tell us:

- [Before starting]
   - I'll tell you one thing right off the bat, look at how small the type is.
  - *How much larger would you have it?*
    - I have an 18" monitor. *Prefers it at 150%*

- What are some reasons you would visit a VA website today?
   - Secure messaging, Rx refills, maybe communication with my doctor in the VA.

- Would you typically use your phone or a computer?
   - I have a desktop I use.



## Task 1 Homepage - 5 min

*Navigate user to* *https://preview.va.gov*

Please take a moment to look at this new version of VA’s main website.

- What are your impressions of this site?
   - If it were me, but if it were me, it sounds stupid, but I would put the different branches of the military, air force, navy, army, marines.  

- *Shows images. Does this do it for you*
   - It's fine. Showing the different retired guys. But the different branches.
   - This type I would center above each one of the headings, instead of it staying to the left.

- What do you think of the layout of this page?
   - The [link] lines don't do anything but make it look busy. If I did anything it would be a bullet point dot at the end of each one. Then you could make the type a little bit better.
   - Again, I would center these (items in top tasks)



## Task 2 Health Care Activity - 5 min

[Did Task 2 after task 3]
- *Try to do one messaging or RX*
  - Clicked Secure Message in Health Care top task
  - Land on Tools Landing page
  - Clicked sign in button; modal opens
  - Clicked sign in with MHV (test account)
   - All this white space. Don't you think you could put maybe a little tutorial. It's nice when someone is talking to you when you're doing it.
  - Logged in. Static Tool Page refreshed.
  - "Came back to home again"

- *What were you expecting?*
     - Go to the page where my doctor and everything is.  
      - Guess I would click on it again. [Clicks on left nav]
      - Lands back on static tool landing page.
      - Is it supposed to come back here? It should have a list of who you're trying to contact.
      - [TASK FAILURE]

        - *Go Back to home page. Try to refill RX*
         - Clicks refill RX in top tasks in health box
         - Click Refill Rx in left nav. Clicks it again. Static tool landing page reloads.  
         - "Didn't do anything" [Does not see 'Go To MHV' button]
         - I would probably log back out and log back in by clicking to close the window out.
         - Landed in MHV somehow (unsure how? need to look at video) 



## Task 3 Health Care Hub - 5 min

*Navigate user to the Health Care Hub* *https://preview.va.gov/health-care/*

- What do you think about the information on this page?
     - It looks a little bit busy. If you're going to have different departments, I would eliminate some of the words and put "VA Health care". Looks like you need to read the story to get something out of it.
- Do you think this would be useful to you?
     - Does any of this have audio tutorials? That would be nice. If you click on something, where you dont have to read it and it tells you what it is.  
     - Homeless Veterans notice is important.
- Did you notice the contact numbers [DESKTOP: on the right side of the page] What do you think about this information?
     - Yah, I saw that.
     - Underlining everything is too much. My grandmother underlined everything. You know you take away the emphasis when you underline everything.
     - Maybe a little flag to denote it rather than underline.



## Task 4 Content Page or Tool Landing Page - 5 min

*Return user to one of the content pages or tool pages they visited in Task 2 or 3*

- Please take a look at the navigation options on [DESKTOP: the left side of the screen] or [MOBILE: under the more in this section menu].  

- What do you think about the options in this menu?
   - It's easy to read.
   - Seems like an adequate list of where you can go.
   - Again the underlining is you know
   - Do they all highlight in blow when you click on it.
   - It's like a scroll bar on this side. Is that what it is?
   - Right so it shows the area you want ot be on.

- Would you use this menu to navigate the website?



## Task 5 Sign-in and Dashboard - 5 min

*Return user to the homepage -  preview.va.gov*

- Where would you go on this page to login to your account?
   - [Missed what he said. Too much noise behind me]

- *Can you tell if you're logged in or logged out*
   - Looking if it denotes my name.
- *Let's say your name is test*
   - I see Jeff up here. Oh right here.
   - I'm logged in because this says "if you want to log out"
 - *Prompt them to sign in if they can, if not use a production account to log them in*
    - Clicked on MyVA once logged in
    - I like the size of the headers
    - Scrolling through dashboard. I did restaurant menus, when you have everything off to the left, I mean. I always like when I get a menu layout. I like when it was centered and broke down the center. It would denote more of a break of what you were viewing.

- What do you think you can do here?

- What were you expecting to see?

- Do you find this information useful?



## Post-study - 2 min

Thanks for taking a look at the new site. We have two follow up questions.

- How did that compare to your past experiences with VA websites?
- If this website went live tomorrow, what would you want other Veterans to know?



## Thank you

We appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us. Your feedback is helpful as we continue to work on the site and make sure it works for Veterans!
