## Warm-up - 3 min

Before we look at the new website, could you please tell us:

- What are the top reasons you would visit a VA website today?
  - Verify appointments
  - Too much mail
    - Don't need benefits. Feels like benefits is wasting money, especially sending information about applying for benefits in the mail
    - *observation*: not targeting based on who he is. VA is wasting money sending him stuff that he is not eligible for 
- Would you typically use your phone or a computer?
  - Flip-phone
