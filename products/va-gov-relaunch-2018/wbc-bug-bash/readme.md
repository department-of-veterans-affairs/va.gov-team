## Submitting Issues

When you find a bug, submit an issue! Submitting an issue is easy. Once you have access to the Vets.gov-team repo on GitHub (if you don't, ask Melissa for access), go [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/issues/new/choose) to submit an issue. 

You should see something that looks like this:

![WBC Bug Bash 2018 New Issue Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/bug-bash/instructions/1-WBC-bug-bash-new-issue.jpg)

Click "Get Started" to begin wrangling your bug. Give your issue a **Title**, describing what went wrong. 

Next, add some labels! All bugs need the `wbc bug bash` label. You should also add a label for the `[practice area]` (i.e. front end, design, devops, content). *If you have any questions or concerns about which practice area label to use, ask a DSVAer for help or leave it blank--we'll take care of this later.*

In the **Description **fill in the sections, providing as much detail as possible. It's important for us to know the **Specs** for reproduction, to know **What happened** so we can try to reproduce it, and know the **Desired behavior** so we can resolve the issue. Make sure to include screenshots and/or recordings so that we know exactly what is wrong and can fix the problem. *Below are some tips and tricks for recording issues.*

## Tips for submitting issues
- If you're on a Mac, screen recording using QuickTime is very easy!
- [Licecap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) is a great gif capture tool, and gifs will animate directly in a GH issue, no need to download them.
- [Qsnap](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/qsnap-screen-capture-scre/bijakfpegjnjmfdoiloebhaemhomjkon) is a great chrome extension
- If you are checking for bugs on mobile, government issued phones disable screen recording and screenshots
