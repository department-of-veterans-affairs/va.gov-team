# Header overview

Header is a highly-visible component that appears on all pages of VA.gov. 

Goals: 
- update desktop header so that it is also in React (similar to the mobile versino)
- use more semantic language to refer to both headers (not mobile vs. desktop, but rather modern vs. legacy or header v1 vs. v2)

### Injection {#injection}

Requests to subdomain hosts such as http://www.benefits.va.gov are not proxied through our systems, therefore are not under our control. We will call these **legacy sites**. Content for these sites are served through TeamSite CMS servers and templates. This process was [established in November 2018](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/issues/12779).

Public Websites team is responsible for supporting teams who want to inject the modernized header and footer into their legacy site. 

#### Workflow
Written by Jill Adams for PW onboarding

1. **Requesting team: domains** - Team should provide the domain or list of domains where the users will land and see the header/footer injected. Once provided, our team can create tickets and schedule our work.


1. **Requesting team: JS/CSS** - Add the listed set of scripts to TeamSiteâ€™s `<head>` tag, described here: https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/teamsite-overview#TeamSiteoverview-ScriptsandTeamSiteAdministration 
Do not include `settings.js` - that file is deprecated but docs are out of date


1. **PW: allowlists** - Our team will add the domains to several allowlists. This change will allow your team to test the injected header/footer. We'll let you know when our updates are deployed and your testing can begin.


1. **Requesting team: Testing & style fixes** -  Your team will test by setting a cookie in your browser. The main issues you may see are styling related, where styles from your site may affect the presentation of the header/footer. Those issues can/should be fixed by updating the CSS of your site / app (rather than by modifying styles for the header / footer globally). This is the bulk of your work, and if no style issues occur, it could potentially be a no-op

   **To test:**
    1. Load the provided domain
    1. Open **Developer Tools** > **Console** in browser
    1. Type `document.cookie = "proxyRewrite=true;"`, and hit Enter
    1. This creates a cookie that you will then find under **Application** tab in dev tools until you clear cookies
    1. Refresh the page, and injected header should load.


1. **PW: Production update** - When your testing / changes are complete & you're ready to launch: notify us. We'll make an additional code update to permanently set the cookie that controls injection. When that code change deploys, the header/footer will be live on your site.
