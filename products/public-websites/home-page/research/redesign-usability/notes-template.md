## Post-Task Interview - 15 minutes
1. What worked *well* for you?
1. What was *unclear or didn't work well* for you?
1. What would you like to *change or add*?
1. I'd like to ask you about a specific part of the first page that you looked at: the dark blue section on Veteran homelessness. 
     1. What are your thoughts on what you see here in this section of the page?   
     1. If there wasn't information on homelessness here, what kind of information might you expect or want to see here?
     1. How often should the information be changed?
1. Now I'd like to ask about another part of the page: under "Search VA.gov" where it says "Other search tools". What does that mean to you?
2. Looking up a bit on the page, tell me about what you see in the bright blue box ("Access and manage your VA benefits and health care", "Sign in and create an account"). 
3. I'd like to know more about how you usually look for information on web pages in general--not specifically VA or government websites. Can you tell me about a web page that you went to recently and how you found what you were looking for on it? 
    1. *RECORD: type into search box / click on links (browse) / _______________________*
    1. Do you ever use a search box on the page?
    2. If so, when?
3. Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you think I should know?
