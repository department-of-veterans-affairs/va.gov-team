# Research Goals
The purpose of this research was to **get user feedback on the redesigned VA.gov home page** and assess whether the design changes have improved the usability of the home page. We observed which areas of the home page were used and how well it supported Veterans, VA beneficiaries, those acting on behalf of Veterans, and service members while completing important benefit-related tasks.

Use of the VA.gov home page fits into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) throughout 

- Starting up (Serving in and separating from the military)
- Living civilian life
- Retiring and aging

# Research Questions
*Note: In this research plan, "successfully completing" a task means that a participant has navigated to a web page on VA.gov where they could do that task or sign in to do the task (participants will NOT sign in during the sessions).*
1. Are ALL participants able to easily complete tasks from the home page? *("easily" = being able to figure out where to go and not get stuck)*
    1. For tasks that are the same as those from last year's baseline wayfinding research, how do success rates compare with last year? 
3. Which parts of the home page do participants use to complete tasks and how? Where do they go first?
    1. "Sign in or create account" button
    3. "Common tasks"
    4. The new search box (next to Common tasks)
    5. "Other search tools" (next to Common tasks)
    6. Benefit hubs (below search and Common tasks)--Are they used at all?
    7. The main content of the page (between the header and footer)--Did they scroll all the way down the page?
    8. VAntage Point blog promo (below search and Common tasks)
    9. Header (including Search, Sign in, VA Benefits and Health Care megamenu)
    10. Footer 
1. When do participants search (by typing into a box) *vs.* browse (clicking on links, such as the benefit hubs)?
    1. Are there differences between browsing/learning tasks *vs.* managing tasks?
    2. Are there differences between people more *vs.* less familiar with VA benefits? 
3. Is there anything that participants find unclear or confusing on the home page? 
    1. Other search tools?
4. What are participants' expectations of the VAntage Point blog promo content?
    1. What content would be helpful to be there?
    2. How often should the content be refreshed?
3. Where do participants typically go to get information and benefits from the VA? (i.e., search engine, VA.gov, call VA, etc.) 

## Areas of focus
In this research, we were primarily interested in the following areas of the home page as used in task completion:
- Login/signup CTA
- Common task list
- Search
- Benefit hubs
- VAntage Point blog promo

# Methodology 
We conducted **remote moderated usability sessions via Zoom**. Participants were asked a few questions about their experiences with VA benefits, and then will be given some **Veteran top tasks** (per [Veteran Top Tasks Unmoderated Survey findings from June 2022](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/research-findings.md) **as wayfinding prompts** to explore the redesigned VA.gov home page on the Staging server. Some of the top tasks were listed in the "Common tasks" section of the redesigned home page, while others were not. For any tasks that were used in last year's baseline wayfinding research, task completion rates will be compared to assess the home page redesign with the baseline (current design on Production). 

Participants were asked to complete some tasks based on which VA benefits they had experience with, per their responses to questions at the beginning of the session. **Each participant did a subset of the full list of 20 tasks in the conversation guide**, and for each, we recorded whether they were successful and also their ease rating on a scale from 1-5. Over the course of the sessions, we tracked how many participants completed each task and prioritized tasks that hadn't been completed by as many participants yet in order to get feedback on each task from at least 4 participants (we surpassed this goal by ending up with each task completed by at least 6 people).

 
# Hypotheses and Conclusions

1. The prominent sign in/sign up location and CTA makes it easier for participants to easily sign in/sign up.
1. More participants will use the prominent sign in/sign up CTA than the button in the header.
1. The streamlined design enables participants to complete tasks efficiently. 
    1. For tasks that are the same as those used in last year's baseline wayfinding research, task completion rates will be higher.
1. Participants will know to search for tasks not listed as "common tasks". 
1. Participants understand where "other search tools" links will take them and what they will find there.
1. A focused and prominently displayed VAntage Point blog promo increases participants' engagement with the content.
1. Participants will scroll all the way down the home page to the footer (even if they don't look at links in the footer). 
2. Most participants start with a search engine, not VA.gov.

# Key Findings

1. **Most research participants used the header, Common tasks, Other search tools, and the benefit hubs** on the redesigned home page. Almost half of the participants used the new search box, and many fewer used the "sign in or create account" button. 


# Details of Findings 

## Navigation
1. **Most research participants used the header, Common tasks, Other search tools, and the benefit hubs** on the redesigned home page. Almost half of the participants used the new search box, and many fewer used the "sign in or create account" button. No one clicked on the Vantage blog promo.

# FROM TOPLINE SO PRELIMINARY...
 
1. **Most participants browsed (clicking links) without using the Search box at all or searched only when browsing didn’t work**. We observed distinct **browse *vs.* search usage patterns** among the participants:
     1. More than a third of participants *browsed exclusively* and never used search to complete tasks.
     2. Only our youngest participant *searched exclusively* to complete tasks. (This same behavior was observed in our youngest pilot participant, whose data isn't included in this report even though he's a Reservist.)
     3. Some participants who *started off browsing and later discovered the search box* were impressed with the results and then used search more. 
     4. A few participants *tried searching, got irrelevant results, and gave up on search*, so only browsed after that.
5. Participants' browsing of the home page often didn't include the entire page but only certain parts of it. Some participants found **one way to navigate that worked for them, which they used it for most tasks**, ignoring other parts of the home page. Here are some **different browsing focus patterns** that we observed:
     1. Only the VA Benefits and Health Care megamenu in the header
     1. Only Common tasks and Other search tools
     1. Only the benefit hubs
     1. A combination of some of the above but usually not all
7. **Most participants (79%) scrolled all the way down** the home page to the footer.
8. Different participants took very **different paths to complete the same tasks**, which was possible because there are many ways to navigate from the home page to the same content page.
9. Each of the top 20 tasks tested in this research were attempted by 6-10 participants with varying degrees of success.
     1. **9 tasks (almost half) were completed successfully by ALL those who tried them**, some more quickly than others.
     1. 7 tasks were completed successfully by 70-90% of those who tried them.
     1. 4 tasks were completed successfully by only half (50-60%) of those who tried them. 
1. Several participants said that it was **redundant or confusing to have two different sign-in buttons** ("Sign in or create an account" near the photos, and "Sign in" in the header). 
     1. One quarter of the participants (5 of 19) said that they'd sign in first--before using the home page--so that they'd see customized links or wouldn't get interrupted later to sign in and then have to figure out how to get back to where they were.
3. Some participants had **difficulty using the VA Benefits and Health Care megamenu because it didn't work as expected** since one dropdown option was already expanded upon opening--either the first option (Health care) or the one last opened.  

### Content
8. The Vantage box entitled "Updates on Veteran homelessness" was interpreted in different ways by participants:
     1. No one said anything about it while doing tasks. During the post-task interview, one participant said they thought it was a banner ad and so ignored it.
     1. Many participants **didn't realize that the Vantage box entitled "Updates on Veteran homelessness" was a news article** and thought it was about much-needed VA help for homeless Veterans. It was a particularly emotional issue for one Veteran, who got teary while discussing her thoughts about it.
     1. Those who noticed the "All VA News" link in the box thought it would be more information about homelessness, or questioned why it was there because it had nothing to do with the homelessness benefit information.
     2. When asked what other types of content should be shown here, several participants said they wanted information about recent legislation enacted, changes in VA benefits or procedures, or specific VA benefits (e.g., disability/claims, education, housing loans). 
3. Almost half of the participants **didn't know what "Yellow Ribbon" means**, which was listed under the heading "Other search tools".




## Other Findings


### Feedback for VA

We heard some feedback specifically for VA, which is listed below but not analyzed because it's outside the scope of this study:
1.   

# Recommendations
1. Consider the following revisions to the Common tasks and Other search tools sections:
     1. ...
2. Consider removing the "Sign in or create account" button because most participants were accustomed to using the "Sign in" button in the header and some were confused by seeing a second button.
3. Consider moving the Vantage blog promo down below the benefit hubs so it doesn't interrupt the user's navigation flow among search, other search tools, and common tasks.

# Next Steps

- Present results to Sitewide Public Websites, Health Apartment, Authenticated Experience, and any other interested teams.
- For tasks that were difficult to do, discuss possible design changes to the redesigned home page to make them easier, and then do another round of usability testing.
