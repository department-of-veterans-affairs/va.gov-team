Trend | Specific finding | Link to research studies
------------------|--------------|-----------
Most people stay focused on only one part of the home page (not all of it fits on their screen at once), mostly not looking at other parts of the page | A majority of 13 participants (both mobile and desktop) stayed focused on only one part of the home page--usually the "top 4" boxes. <br /> <br /> Some participants found one way to navigate that worked for them, which they used it for most tasks, ignoring other parts of the home page | May 2021 [Baseline Wayfinding research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding/research-report.md#Wayfinding-Issues)<br /> <br /> Aug 2022 [Home page redesign usability testing round 1](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/home-page/research/redesign-usability/research-findings.md#details-of-findings)
Most participants browsed (clicking links) without using the Search box at all or searched only when browsing didn’t work | None of 13 participants started with site search, but about half went there when they were unable to find any relevant links elsewhere on the home page. Most participants browsed (clicking links) without using the Search box at all or searched only when browsing didn’t work. <br /> <br /> 7 of 19 participants browsed exclusively and never used search to complete tasks, another 7 started browsing and later discovered the search box, 3 mostly browsed but tried search once, 1 tried search and had success but then irrelevant results so then started browsing, 1 searched exclusively. <br /> <br /> All 7 participants tried browsing first, before searching | May 2021 [Baseline Wayfinding research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding/research-report.md#Wayfinding-Issues)<br /> <br />  Aug 2022 [Home page redesign usability testing round 1](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/home-page/research/redesign-usability/research-findings.md#details-of-findings) <br /> <br /> Sept 2021 [Search Design Concepts usability testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/on-site-search/research/user-research/2021-Aug-research-study/research-findings.md#details-of-findings)
Some participants have difficulty reading the smallest fonts | One older participant (81 years old) had difficulty reading the font of the links in the "top 4" boxes, which they thought was because the links were blue and small. In contrast, they *were* able to read the headers in the "top 4" boxes (larger font) and the text on content pages (black in color). <br /> <br /> One participant said that the smallest font size was too small for them to read (benefit hub descriptions). | May 2021 [Baseline Wayfinding research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding/research-report.md#Wayfinding-Issues)<br /> <br />  Aug 2022 [Home page redesign usability testing round 1](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/home-page/research/redesign-usability/research-findings.md#details-of-findings)
When wanting to change their dependents, many people go to the Family Member Benefits page, but you can't do it from there | 4 of 13 tried the Family member benefits page <br /> <br /> 7 of 19 used the megamenu or benefit hubs to get to the Family member benefits page | May 2021 [Baseline Wayfinding research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding/research-report.md#Wayfinding-Issues)<br /> <br />  Aug 2022 [Home page redesign usability testing round 1](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/home-page/research/redesign-usability/research-findings.md#details-of-findings)
When wanting to get their VA medical records, many people go to the Health care page, but you can't do it from there (need to be on Records)  | 2 of 13 looked for medical records under Health care, not Records <br /> <br /> 1 participant used the megamenu or benefit hubs to get to the Health care page | May 2021 [Baseline Wayfinding research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding/research-report.md#Wayfinding-Issues)<br /> <br />  Aug 2022 [Home page redesign usability testing round 1](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/home-page/research/redesign-usability/research-findings.md#details-of-findings)
