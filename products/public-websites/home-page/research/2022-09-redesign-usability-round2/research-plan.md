# Research Plan for VA.gov Home Page Redesign ROUND 2 Usability Testing [Sitewide Home Page team, October 2022]

## Background
The current VA.gov website was launched in 2018 but hadn't been the subject of much user research until [Baseline Wayfinding Research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding/research-report.md) was conducted in April 2021. Findings from this research and also from [Search Design Concepts Usability Research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/on-site-search/research/user-research/2021-Aug-research-study/research-findings.md) have been incorporated into a new VA.gov home page design, which was usability tested in August 2022. Now more revisions have been made to the home page design, and we're doing a second round of usability testing.

### OCTO Objectives 

This research supports the following [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme): 
1. Veterans and their families can apply for all benefits online 
1. Veterans can manage their health services online 
1. Logged-in users can easily track applications, claims, or appeals online

### Veteran Journey
Use of the VA.gov home page fits into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) throughout 
- Starting up (Serving in and separating from the military)
- Living civilian life 
- Retiring and aging

## Research Goals	
The purpose of this research is to **get user feedback on the *newly revised version* of the redesigned VA.gov home page** and assess whether the design changes have improved the usability of the home page. We will observe which areas of the home page they use and how well it supports Veterans, VA beneficiaries, caregivers, and service members while completing benefit-related tasks. 

### Outcome
This research will inform future iterations of the home page redesign, future research, and release decisions.

### Research questions
*Note: In this research plan, "successfully completing" a task means that a participant has navigated to a web page on VA.gov where they could do that task or sign in to do the task (participants will NOT sign in during the sessions).*
1. Are participants able to successfully complete tasks from the home page without getting stuck?
    1. How do task success rates compare to those in the first round of usability testing?  
1. Which parts of the home page do participants use to complete tasks? 
    1. Featured VA news at top of page (PACT Act)
    2. "Create account" button
    4. The new search box 
    5. "Other search tools" 
    3. "Popular on VA.gov"
    4. VA News content in the middle of the page (PathFinder)
    6. Benefit hubs 
    9. Header (including Search, Sign in, VA Benefits and Health Care megamenu)
    10. Footer 
1. Do participants know when to use the "Sign in" *vs.* "Create account" buttons?
1. Do participants scroll all the way down the page to the footer? Do they stop at the row of photos?
1. Is there anything that participants find unclear or confusing on the home page, especially when using a smartphone or a screen reader? 
1. What are participants' impressions of the two new content sections (with PACT Act and Pathfinder news articles)?
    1. Do they interpret them as news?
    1. What do they think of the "More VA News" link?
    1. How would they get more details on these topics?
    1. How would they get stories on other topics?

### Areas of focus
In this research, we are primarily interested in the following areas of the home page as used in task completion:
- Create account button
- New search box
- Other search tools
- Popular on VA.gov
- Benefit hubs
- VA News featured at top and lower down on page

### Hypotheses
1. The revised home page design will result in improved task success rates as compared to the first round of usability testing, especially including the tasks below.
    1. The 4 tasks with the lowest success rates:
        1. Check current disability compensation rates (60%)
        2. Compare education benefits by school (56%)
        3. Add spouse (Review/update dependents) (56%)
        4. File for disability increase (50%)
    2. The 2 tasks with lower success rates than last year's baseline wayfinding research:
        1. Message your doctor (83%)
        1. Add spouse (Review/update dependents) (56%)
1. There are no significant differences in task success rate across devices (especially smartphones) or screen reader users.
1. Participants will scroll all the way down the home page to the footer (even if they don't look at links in the footer). 
1. Participants will know when to use the "sign in" *vs.* "create an account" buttons.
1. The home page supports multiple ways of navigating, and participants will find a way to complete every task--i.e., there's a navigation path that works for them. 
1. Participants understand that the news content blocks are news.
2. Participants will be interested in the news content and know how to learn more about them.

## Method	
We will conduct **remote moderated usability sessions via Zoom**. Participants will be asked a few questions about their past usage of the VA.gov site, and then will be given some **tasks as wayfinding prompts** to explore the redesigned VA.gov home page on the Staging server, including some that didn't go well in the [previous round of usability testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/home-page/research/redesign-usability/research-findings.md).

## Recruitment	

Ask Perigean to recruit **16 Veterans, Veterans' caregivers, Veterans' family members, and service members** in order to get **10 completed sessions** using the criteria below.

### Recruitment criteria
Add the total requested number, ideal completed sessions and breakdown type of participants for this study. 

`Ex. TR: 10; CS: 6; Vets: 5; Fam: 0; Care: 5; Serv: 0`

|Total requested|Completed sessions|Veterans|Family Member|Caregivers|Service Members|
|:-------------:|:----------------:|:------:|:-----------:|:--------:|:-------------:|
|       14      |         10       |    9  |     2        |    2     |        1      | 

### Criteria Table (Please read carefully)
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 

- If this is for a single ***MODERATED*** study, breakdown your total requested participants for each category by number--***not percentage*** in the moderated column. 
- ***This will be applied across particpant types you need*** (*Veterans, caregivers, etc.*) for all categories (*Sex, race, etc*) you select. 
- For example, if you request 10 particpants, for 5 Veterans, and 5 caregivers, you could ask for 5 males, 5 females, and Perigean will apply those numbers across those two particpant types. Do the same for any other category you want Perigean to use for recruitment. You **do not** have to use every category, or even specific type in a catogory. Only add to the category/type that will make your study successful.
- ***Various*** means you want an array of participants from this category but are leaving it to Perigean's discretion to recruit as many different types as possible.
- If you choose ***Various*** for a category, but wish to exclude a specific type, place an **X** in it's row. However, you can choose ***Various*** and also specific types of a category to be included (Ex. Various 7, Black 3, White X.)
- For benefits category, you may also choose ***No Ben/Ser Exp*** which means you want particpants who haven't had experience using any Veteran benefit or service. In your additional screener section, you can specify exactly which benefit or service you want participants not to have had experience using. 
- For hardware category, select which type/s you want participants to join your session to use.

**Identity Assurance Levels**

- **IAL1:** Attributes, if any, are self-asserted or should be treated as self-asserted; there is no proofing process. (***Ex., User generated user name and pw***)

- **IAL2:** Either remote or in-person identity proofing is required using, at a minimum, the procedures given in NIST SP 800-63A. (***Ex., Id.me or Login.gov account***)

- **IAL3:** In-person or supervised-remote identity proofing is required. Identifying attributes must be verified through examination of physical documentation as described in NIST SP 800-63A.
