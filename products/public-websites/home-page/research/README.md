| VA.gov Home Page Redesign Usability Testing | _Planned for July 2022_ | To get user feedback on the redesigned VA.gov home page and assess whether the design changes have improved the usability of the home page |[Usability research plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/home-page/research/redesign-usability/research-plan.md)|  _TBD_|
| Top Tasks - Unmoderated | June 2022 | To discover which tasks are viewed as most important by Veterans, caregivers, family members, and service members |[Unmoderated top task findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/research-findings.md)| <ul><li> Most top tasks were related to health care.</li><li>Most frequently done tasks were all related to health care and aligned closely with the overall top tasks. </li><li>Top tasks vary by participant age and are quite different for participants who don't use VA health care. </li><li>Participants selected an average of 9.5 tasks as important.</li><li> It is challenging to recruit people who don't use VA benefits. </li></ui> |
| Top Tasks - Moderated | May 2022 | To validate the task list and questions to be used in unmoderated research | [Moderated research findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/moderated/research-findings.md) | <ul><li>The survey was well-received by research participants overall. Small adjustments will be made before launching the unmoderated phase, such as changes to task wording, support for participants interacting with the VA indirectly and expansion of the instructions and context for the survey. </li><li>Participants selected an average of 13 tasks as important (ranging from 3 to 26). </li></ui>|
| Baseline Wayfinding Research on VA.gov | April 2021 | To determine how well the VA.gov homepage enables Veteran task completion |[Wayfinding research findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding#baseline-wayfinding-research-on-vagov-april-2021) | <ul><li>This research demonstrated consistency of Veteran wayfinding regardless of their familiarity with the site, presence of cognitive issues or device used.</li><li>Most participants focused on the top four boxes and tasks easily identified there had the highest rates of success.</li><li>It is difficult to find tasks which don't appear in the top 4 boxes. For example, only 8% of participants were able to find a form to appoint a representative</li><li>Search was used as a last resort, if at all.</li><li>Only half opened the mega menu, one-third never scrolled beyond the images and most didn’t find “Find a VA” or “Resources and support”.</li><li>See also this homepage user wish list</li></ui>
| Comprehensive user research conducted for the 2018 VA.gov home page | October 2018 | <ul><li> To learn how to organize other “non-benefit” resources </li><li> To validate benefit lifecycle assumptions </li><li> To gather feedback on homepage designs</li><li> To validate the navigation model.</li></ul>| [Comprehensive user findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-gov-relaunch-2018/user-research/brand-consolidation-research-summary-10-25-2018.pptx) | <ul><li>The default mental model used by Veterans is organization by benefit category, followed by task.</li><li>Veterans prefer simple, clear, easy to read layouts and are overwhelmed by too many options.</li><li>Veterans want above the fold, one-click access for priority tasks.</li><li>“Explore and apply” label works well for many tasks but differentiating between “get” and “manage” adds complexity.</li><li>Sheer volume of content and menu levels contributes to poor performance on navigation tasks.</li></ui>
