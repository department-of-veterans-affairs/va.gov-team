| My VA Redirect UAT | August 2022 | To confirm that the redirect to My VA from homepage log-in functions as expected and to evaluate how the redirect does or doesn’t meet Veteran expectations. | [Redirect UAT research findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/my-va-redirect/UAT/topline-summary.md#additional-findings) | <ul><li> Most participants usually go to eBenefits or MHV instead of VA.gov, so they have no current attachment to the homepage. </li><li> 5 of 10 participants preferred landing on My VA over the homepage (because of personalization "MY stuff"). The most significant points of confusion we observed were related to the login process. </li><li> The redirects and 2FA process of logging in are disruptive enough that participants are grateful to just be done with that by the time they get to My VA. </li><li> 5 participants preferred the homepage or the mobile app to My VA.These participants quickly scanned the headings in the 4 quadrants to get a sense of what they could find on the page.
| Health Hub Moderated Tree Test | July 2022 | To understand how Veterans navigate between "get benefits" and "manage benefits" for healthcare | [Link to plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/health-apartment/Health%20Hub/Research/Research%20%232/Draft%20Research%20plan%202%207.12.22.pdf) | |
| Health Hub benefits navigation - IA Tree Jack | May 2022 | To evaluate which design better helps Veterans navigate tasks in ‘get benefits’ and ‘manage benefits’, specifically for health care: when there is one unified section to ‘get benefits’ and ‘manage benefits’ (H0) or when there are two separate sections for ‘get benefits’ and ‘manage benefits’ (H1) | [Final IA treejack synthesis](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/health-apartment/Health%20Hub/Research/IA%20Tree%20Test%201/Reasearch%20synthesis%20Veteran%20and%20caregiver%20IA%20treejack%207.12.22.pdf) |<ul><li> H0 performed best on "manage tasks" and had the most direct success, including for Veterans without health care </li><li> There wasn't a clear hypothesis that outperformed the other for "get" tasks | 
| Comparative analysis: Personalization and profile| December 2021 | To compare aspects of personalized and authenticated civic service experiences with those in the private sector | [Personalization and profile findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/discovery-research/comparative-analysis/personalization-profile-comparative-analytsis.pptx) | The key differences between the authenticated experience (AE) on VA.gov and comparative sites are the <ul><li>logged in homepage</li><li>information architecture</li></ul> 
| Health apartment homepage - Guerilla testing of homepage concepts | December 2021 | To learn how Veterans manage their health care, what actions Veterans expect to take and what information is expected in each section | [Apartment homepage findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/health-apartment/design/design%20presentation/Design%20and%20Research%20Share%2012.20.21%20-%20Guerilla%20Research.pdf)|<ul><li>Participants wanted specific task-specific action links</li><li>Tasks should be clear and separate from information links</li><li>Participants wanted some form of personalization (especially for health care and disability tasks)</li></ui>
| Search Design Concepts Usability Research | September 2021 | To get user feedback on new design concepts for surfacing site search and other search tools, including [a new link on the VA.gov home page under the "top 4" boxes](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/on-site-search/research/user-research/2021-Aug-research-study/images/new-search-link.png) that goes to the new search landing page and [links to other search tools](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/on-site-search/research/user-research/2021-Aug-research-study/images/search-landing-pg.png) | [Search design findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/on-site-search/research/user-research/2021-Aug-research-study/research-findings.md) | <ul><li>Participants were laser focused on finding a search box to use. Once they found it, most participants didn't scroll down below it</li><li>Consolidation of all the search tools is recommended since using different search tools on different pages can be confusing (i.e., VA.gov site search, Find a VA Form, Resources and Support)</li><li>Search on VA.gov returns a lot of irrelevant results, and so many Veterans have learned to look elsewhere first.</li></ui>
| Logged-in Homepage User Research | May 2020 | To talk with Veterans to better understand their needs and what would make the logged-in experience more useful to them inform the design for treating the logged-in homepage as a user's personalized landing pad and router | [Logged in findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md) | <ul><li>Participants want a page that is focused on current information specific to them, rather than generalized information for all Veterans.</li><li>Participants are primarily interested in completing healthcare and disability related tasks such as messaging, ordering medication, and checking claim status.</li><li>Participants were interested in benefit recommendations and eligibility information.</li><li>Participants were interested in information that helps them be more involved with the VA as a whole, and take better care of themselves.</li><li>Participants expect a mix of links and widgets to complete tasks on their homepage, and want clear labels to understand next steps.</li><li>Participants typically look for notifications in the top portion of a page, but expect notifications from the VA outside of their logged-in experience.</li></ui>
