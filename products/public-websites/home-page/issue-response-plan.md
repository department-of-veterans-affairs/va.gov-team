## Systems
### DevOps/Global: Website
- Provides static content for the Vets.gov website. Dependencies include VA network services (TIC, F5, ...), nginx reverse proxies and S3.
- The basics of the technical architecture that supports the Lighthouse Platform API and the Veteran-facing Services Platform (www.va.gov + api.va.gov) can be found in the [Technical Architecture Overview](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/eaf7de91784c2f18da908f5de47fe3f5117629d2/platform/engineering/TechnicalArchitectureOverview.md) folder

### CMS
- [VA-CMS Incident Response Procedure Overview](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/cms/helpdesk/incident-response.md)
- An overall architecture for the Content API is available, including this [high-level diagram showing the flow of HTML, content, and assets between Drupal and the React Application](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/cms/public-content-api/architecture.md#high-level). 

### Search 
- Search.gov provides indexed search results via a web results API. The VA.gov API consumes responses from this endpoint and communicates results to the FE.
