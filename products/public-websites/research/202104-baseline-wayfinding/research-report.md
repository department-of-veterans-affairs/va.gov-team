## Research Goals 
The purpose of this research is to get a baseline understanding of how the current VA.gov website is being used by Veterans and others. With a better understanding of Veterans' pain points and successes while using [VA.gov](va.gov), we can make more informed decisions about priorities for future research and design work in website navigation and tools.

## Research Methodology 

We conducted remote moderated research sessions via Zoom on **April 26 - May 5, 2021**. Participants were asked about their past usage of the VA.gov site, and then were given some common Veteran tasks as wayfinding prompts to explore the live VA.gov website. Wayfinding was assessed in terms of participants' success in doing the following typical Veteran tasks (goal in parentheses):
1. Ask your VA doctor a followup question (send a secure message)
1. Find out if your disability claim has been approved (track claim status)
1. Find the form to fill out to say that you want someone to be your representative in your disability claim appeal (find form 21-22a Appointment of Individual As Claimant's Representative)
1. Update your bank information for disability compensation payments (change direct deposit)
1. Set up your travel to medical appointments to be reimbursed by direct deposit (direct deposit for VA travel pay reimbursement)
1. Find nearest VA hospital to a city you're planning to visit (find a VA location)
1. Get a document that shows the income you receive from the VA (download benefit letter or payment history)
1. Share VA medical history with a doctor outside the VA (get your VA medical records)
1. Tell the VA about your new spouse (add dependent)

We also explored analytics data to see where people click on the VA.gov home page, and we compared these usage statistics with observations from the research sessions.

### Who we talked to

We talked to **13 participants**:
- 12 Veterans, including one who was also a caregiver for another Veteran
- 1 family member of a Veteran

Participants were on a variety of devices:
- 8 on a desktop/laptop computer
- 4 on a smartphone
- 1 on a tablet

Participant demographics:
- 9 had no college degree; 4 had a degree
- 7 lived in rural/remote locations; 6 in major metro areas
- 6 were age 55-64 or older; 1 was under 35
- 4 were people of color
- 3 were female
- 3 had a cognitive disability
- 2 had never used VA.gov before
- 1 used a screen reader

One of the sessions was cut short due to technology issues, so most of the findings came from 12 of the sessions.

### Research Questions
- Where do Veterans typically start? (Google/Facebook/MHV/eBenefits/contact center call or email/VA.gov)
- What do they typically do on VA.gov? What tools have they tried using?
- Do they find what they're looking for? If not, what were they looking for?
- What pain points are there in terms of findability and usage?
- What works well?
- What differences are there for desktop *vs.* smartphone users?
- What differences are there for people who have cognitive disabilities?
- What differences are there for people who use screen readers?
- What differences are there for people who have used VA.gov before *vs.* haven't used it?
- Do Veterans read/notice/click/comment on the banner content on the home page?

### Hypotheses
1. Veterans are focused on what they’re looking for and don’t want to navigate multiple tools unless it helps them get better results.
    1. LIKELY TRUE: Participants in this study were focused on the tasks they were asked to do and weren't seeking different tools. Participants that were shown *Find a Form* and *Resources and support* were enthusiastic about them because it made their task easier to do.
1. Veterans don't care where the information they're looking for is stored, as long as they are able to find it.
    1. LIKELY TRUE: Participants didn't talk about where information is stored and didn't realize that search results from *Find a VA Location*, *Find a Form*, and *Resources and support* came from different places. The idea of what content is in what repository is not relevant to the Veteran's task at hand.
3. Veterans aren't using all of the current search and browse tools on VA.gov. 	
    1. DEFINITELY TRUE: Most participants were focused on the "top 4" boxes most of the time, with limited exploration of the header and links below. Many participants didn't use the VA Benefits and Health Care megamenu, some didn't use Find a VA Location, and many didn't use any links below the row of pictures.

## Key Findings
1. All participants were able to successfully complete 3 of the 9 tasks (#2, 1, 4), and most completed 3 more of the tasks (#6, 7, 9), but the other 3 tasks had lower success rates because the navigation paths weren't straightforward (#3, 5, 8--form to appoint representative, set up direct deposit for VA travel pay reimbursement, and share VA medical history with a doctor outside the VA).
2. A majority of participants (both mobile and desktop) stayed focused on only one part of the VA.gov home page--usually the "top 4" boxes--and for the most part didn't look at anything else on the page. These findings were consistent with analytics data.
3. No participants started with site search, but about half went there when they were unable to find any relevant links elsewhere on the home page.
4. A few accessibility issues were encountered, including font readability, site search findability with screen readers, and banner alert notification to screen readers. 
5. There were no significant differences in wayfinding results for mobile *vs.* desktop users, participants with *vs.* without a cognitive disability, or people familiar *vs.* not with VA.gov. For screen readers, VA.gov worked well, although wayfinding takes longer because hearing text read aloud is slower than visually scanning.
6. Four participants had a lot of difficulty searching on the *Find a VA form* page because they included too many words in the search query and/or misspelled a key word in the query.
7. Three participants complained about the COVID banner alert they kept seeing, including one using a screen reader.


## Details of Findings

### Wayfinding successes 

1. **All participants were able to successfully complete 3 of the 9 tasks** (#2, 1, 4), and most completed 3 more of the tasks (#6, 7, 9).
![task-summary](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding/images/task-summary.png)
3. **Most participants used the links in the "top 4" boxes extensively**, finding them useful to complete the tasks.
4. The VA.gov home page **worked well with a screen reader**. *"This is user friendly for a screen reader...not a lot of graphics...works pretty good" (p19).*
5. Half of the participants (all desktop users, not mobile) **used the links in the left nav on content pages**. However, there was one person who thought that there were *too many options* on the content pages with all the left nav links; this person preferred the interface for MyHealtheVet (MHV), which has only a small number of clear options at the top of the home page.

### Wayfinding Issues
1. **Many participants were unable to successfully complete 3 of the tasks** (#3, 5, 8), the first of which was completed without any assistance by only one participant. Participants couldn't find what they were looking for (form to appoint representative, set up direct deposit for VA travel pay reimbursement, and share VA medical history with a doctor outside the VA).  **Navigation paths to complete some of these tasks were not straightforward**. Here are some of the navigation paths and places where people got stuck, along with some suggestions for improving them:
    1. When asked at the end of the session what they didn't like about VA.gov, almost half of the participants said that it was **difficult to find what you need, especially when it isn't in the "top 4" boxes**. *"A lot of things I can't find" (p1)*.    
    1. For form to appoint representative: Two participants looked for forms in the "top 4" disability or records boxes. 
    3. For travel reimbursement direct deposit: Two people who found the [VA travel pay reimbursement page](https://www.va.gov/health-care/get-reimbursed-for-travel-pay/) didn't notice the "Learn how to set up direct deposit for VA travel pay reimbursement" link. Four people were looking for a link about travel in the "top 4" health care box or under *VA Benefits and Health Care* megamenu > Health care. 
        1. *Consider adding "Travel pay reimbursement" to "top 4" boxes and VA Benefits and Health Care megamenu under health care and/or disability.*
    4. For medical records: 3 people missed the call to action button under "Please sign in to view your VA medical records" and got confused by the content about the Veterans Health Information Exchange and opting out. Two people thought you couldn't get your VA medical records to an outside doctor or didn't know how to do that. Two people thought that medical records would be under health care (not records). 
        1. *Consider adding medical records to the health care "top 4" box.*
    5. To change direct deposit: "Top 4" box disability > View your payment history > What should I do if I need to change my direct deposit or contact information? Change your information online. "Top 4" box records > Change your address > Change your VA direct deposit and contact information. 
        1. *Consider adding "Update direct deposit" link to the "top 4" boxes.*
     3. For proof of income: Over half of participants went to "View your payment history". Is there a way to show proof of income from the payment history page? One participant said that "Benefits letters" wasn't the right place to go. Another participant thought that "View payment history" sounded like what they paid the VA, not what the VA paid them.
    6. For add dependent: A third of participants looked in Family Member Benefits (a topic below the pictures) or the "top 4" Records box. 
        1. *Consider adding "Add/change dependent" to the "top 4" records box and on the Family Member Benefits page.*  
    8. For find VA location: Two participants never found the facility locator and instead used site search. One typed "Knoxville" and got no relevant results; the other searched "VA in Cincinnati OH" and found results.
    9. For message doctor: One participant was confused about why they would message their doctor from VA.gov when they know they have to go to MHV to do this, as their doctor's office told them. They didn't realize that they could do this from VA.gov. One participant went to the facility locator to find their doctor's office phone number or contact them online. Later they found secure messaging in the "top 4" health care box.


1. **The VA.gov home page is long, and a majority of participants (both mobile and desktop) stayed focused on only one part of it (usually the "top 4" boxes), mostly not looking at anything else on the page.** This was true for both mobile and desktop users, which is also consistent with analytics data (for detailed visualizations, see "Where People Click" section below). One participant on a smartphone stayed focused on the *VA Benefits and Health Care* megamenu instead of the "top 4" boxes. 
    1. Most participants (77%) didn't find the *Resources and support* page on their own, though about half found the travel reimbursement direct deposit article via browsing or searching from the VA.gov home page. The participants who were shown this page wanted easier access to it from the top of the home page near the *Sign in* button or under Menu (for mobile).
    1. Most participants (69%) didn't find the *Find a VA form* page on their own, but once they were shown it, they wanted easier access to it from the top of the home page to the right of Find a VA Location or under Menu (for mobile). *"Oh wow, I didn't even know they had this!" (p17).*
    1. Half of the participants never opened the *VA Benefits and Health Care* megamenu. 
    1. A third of the participants never scrolled down past the row of images on the home page; they stopped as if it were the bottom of the page. One participant who did eventually scroll said *"I usually won't scroll all the way to the bottom of a page" (p16)* but did while trying to do one of the tasks. These results are consistent with analytics data, which says that only about 11% of users scroll all the way to the bottom of the home page, 32% scroll 3/4 of the way down, and 57% scroll halfway.
        1. *Consider moving the row of images down to the actual bottom of the page.*
1. **No participants started with site search (in the header of the home page), but about half went there when they were unable to find any relevant links elsewhere on the home page.** Some participants said that they didn't notice *Search* in the header at first, but once they found it, a few used it in later tasks.
    1. *"It is an option of last resort. When all else fails, use the search function." (p16)*
    1. One participant never used site search because they didn't notice it in the header. They readily used the search box, which is visible without clicking, in *Find a Form* and *Resources and Support*.
        1. *Consider adding a search box next to the word* Search *in the header to make it more visible.*

1. **Two accessibility issues were encountered:**
    1. One older participant (81 years old) had difficulty reading the font of the links in the "top 4" boxes, which they thought was because the links were blue and small. In contrast, they were able to read the headers in the "top 4" boxes (larger font) and the text on content pages (black in color). There were no spontaneous comments about font readability from the other older participants (1 age 75 or older, 1 65-74, and 3 55-64). 
    2. One pilot test participant who uses a screen reader (accessibility specialist Angela Fowler) said that site search wasn't easy to find because you have to specifically look for a form instead of seeing it in the landmarks list (as on google.com). 
3. One participant (and also a pilot participant who was a Veteran) **wanted to sign in first** when they opened VA.gov *("easier to sign in [first] because it will ask me to later", p11)*. This participant was asked to proceed without signing in.

### Differences by Participant Categories
- **Mobile vs. desktop**: There were *no major differences in research results between mobile and desktop users*, as users on both kinds of devices spent much of their time on the "top 4" boxes. The big difference between mobile and desktop is the interaction required to reach other links: mobile users have to tap the "Menu" button in the header before they can see the *VA Benefits and Health Care* megamenu and *Find a VA Location*. Of the 5 mobile users in this research, 3 used the Menu button and seemed comfortable doing so. The other 2 mobile users did not use the "Menu" button during the research sessions, and it is unknown whether they noticed it or not. The footer on mobile has accordians to access *VA Forms, Resources and support,* and *Find a VA Location* links, but none of the mobile research participants scrolled down to the footer to see this. 
- **Cognitive disability**: 3 participants were reported to have a cognitive disability, but this was not confirmed during the research sessions. *No significant differences* in task performance were observed between these individuals and the others, although one of them was among the four participants overall who had difficulty typing concise search queries and correctly spelling the words in them. A different participant with a cognitive disability finished fewer tasks than many other participants, but that was likely due to their tendency to talk in detail about their experiences with the VA and focus less on completing the research tasks.
- **Screen reader**: The one participant who used a screen reader completed fewer tasks than many other participants because *listening to their screen reader read text aloud resulted in slower navigation*. 
- **Hadn't used VA.gov before**: Only 2 participants had never used VA.gov before, and there were *no notable differences* in their interactions with the website when compared to the other participants.

### Non-Wayfinding Successes

1. All 5 participants who were shown the ***Resources and support* page** were able to use it to complete the relevant task by browsing topics or searching on the page. 
1. Two participants noticed **typeahead prompts** while searching and used them. One typed "loans" and then selected "loan eligibility"; the other typed "add spouse" and then selected "dependent".


### Non-Wayfinding Issues

1. Four participants had a lot of **difficulty searching on the *Find a VA form* page** because they included too many words in the search query and/or misspelled a key word in the query ("representative"). In all of these cases, participants seemed surprised that they didn't get any relevant search results, perhaps because they're accustomed to Google's success with long and/or misspelled queries. To be successful at searching on the *Find a VA Form* page, you need to choose not too many words for the search query *and* spell them correctly.
    1. Search queries that didn't work: "assign a representive", "assign a representative", "va representative for appeals", "how do I get a representative for va assistance", "representative for claim", "representative for claim filing", "representative for claim appeal"
    2. Search queries that *did* work: “assign representative”, "disability representative", "representative appeal"
    3. One participant corrected their spelling of "reimbursement" when they saw a red underline (from the browser), clicked on it, and then chose the correct spelling.
    4. One participant searched for "spouse" but the "add dependent" form wasn't in the search results.
    5. One participant didn't try the search box at first because they didn't have the form number and didn't realize that you could enter keywords instead.
3. **Three participants complained about the COVID banner alert they kept seeing**, one of which said they wanted to be able to close it to get it out of the way. Three participants acknowledged the alert but didn't comment on it. The other participants didn't say anything about it.
    1. *"Yuck! Don't want to keep seeing it because I already hear about it constantly from the VA" (p8).*
    1. *"Can't wait for the COVID popups to stop" (p19, who uses a screen reader)*. Their screen reader was reading the alert aloud every time they opened the page, and so they couldn't ignore it.
6. One participant expected that changing their direct deposit information would update it for all types of VA payments (e.g., disability, retirement, travel reimbursement) at once. This currently isn't the case because at least disability and travel reimbursement have to be updated in different places.
7. One participant saw a "your browser is out of date" error message while waiting for search results. Nick Sullivan's interpretation is that the participant's browser was waiting for this JS to load: https://dap.digitalgov.gov/Universal-Federated-Analytics-Min.js?agency=VA. This problem should be fixed, assuming it's not a rare random occurrence; Nick and Marci have seen it before. During the session, going back and resubmiting the search resolved the problem.

## Additional Insights
1. When participants were asked where they typically go **to get information and benefits from the VA, over half said that they go to VA.gov**, a third go to MyHealtheVet, two people call the VA, and one person said they search on google.
1. 83% of participants said that **if they can't find what they're looking for online, they would call the VA** (800 number, a regional number, VSO, or a clinic). However, they try to avoid this because of the inconveniences of long hold times, people unable to answer their questions, and frequent transfers to other people/departments. **Half of the participants said they would use google search** to help, and two said they might go to a VA facility to ask.
3. One participant who lives in a rural/remote area and doesn't have cell coverage in his house said that every time he wants to log in, he has to stand outside for 5-12 minutes waiting to receive an authentication text message on his phone. He said that his banks and credit card companies all allow authentication via email and asked why the VA isn't doing that. We advised him to download the ID.me authenticator app for **two-factor authentication**. 
    1. *Consider adding an article to Resources and Support about two-factor authentication. Is it possible to use to select a photo to authenticate like eBenefits does?*
5. In addition to the specific issues described above, there were a few **additional pain points** mentioned by some of the participants:
    1. Signing in
    1. Needing to go back and forth between VA.gov and eBenefits because one links to the other and back, and so you're unable to accomplish your task on just one website. 


## Recommendations
Below are some *initial* recommendations based on research findings to be discussed and revised with the team: 
1. Because many people aren't finding the *Find a Form* and *Resources & support* links in the footer, consider providing additional links in the header where more people will see it (i.e., "VA Forms", "Resources" or "Help").  
1. Since people spend so much time looking at links in the "top 4" boxes, consider adding additional links and/or a "View more" link in each box. Additional links to consider are the following:
    1. Travel pay reimbursement (add to Health care box and *VA Benefits and Health Care* megamenu under health care and/or disability)
    2. Update direct deposit (add to Records box)
    3. Medical records (add to the Health care box, in addition to Records)
    4. Update dependents (add to Records box and also on the Family Member Benefits page)
    5. Appoint representative (add to Disability box)
    6. VA forms (add to Disability box)
3. To make site search more visible, consider adding a search box next to the word *Search* in the header and/or just above or below the "top 4" boxes. Also, the search box should be wider so that long search strings don't scroll off the end (which was observed during research sessions).
4. Consider moving the row of images down to the actual bottom of the page so it doesn't give a false "bottom of the page" signal in the middle of the page.
5. Consider making it possible to get proof of income in the form of benefit letters from the View payment history page, as well as from site searches for "income" or "proof of income". 
6. Work on improving the *Find a Form* search. Marci is working with Lighthouse to improve the search logic. Kelson has had success improving the search logic of *Resources and support*. Consider some of the following:
    1. Remove articles and other helper words (e.g., "a", "the", "how do I") from search queries before searching
    2. Search on only the first few words of a long search query
    3. Provide typeahead suggestions for common search queries while entering a search query 
    4. Add some fixed links per search query (e.g., a search for "spouse" should return the form to add/update dependents)
5. Consider making the COVID banner alert on the home page dismissable (as it is on other content pages) to reclaim screen real estate and stop annoying Veterans. Also, accessibility specialist Josh Kim recommends making the alert less annoying to screen reader users by changing the current *aria-live* attribute from *assertive* (interrupts user actions) to *polite*, which tells the screen reader to wait until the user is done to announce updates.
6. Consider increasing the font size of the links in the "top 4" boxes from the current 16px to 19px, which is the current recommendation (though not required) for older users, per Josh Kim and our peers (including Gov.uk, NHS, Health Literacy Online), because many of our users are older. We could conduct more research on the VA.gov home page with people age 55-64 or older.
7. Consider revising the site search box to make it easier to find quickly while using a screen reader by coding search as a [landmark role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/Search_role) (per Josh Kim and Angela Fowler).
8. Investigate the JS https://dap.digitalgov.gov/Universal-Federated-Analytics-Min.js?agency=VA that didn't load, causing a "your browser is out of date" error message instead of search results. 
9. Consider adding an article to *Resources and support* about two-factor authentication. See if it's possible to use to select a photo to authenticate like eBenefits does.
10. Consider additional user research on the home page header if add new links to Forms, Resources or Help. (Shawna also has additional ideas; if any are relevant, ADD THEM HERE)

## Next Steps
- Discuss findings and recommendations with the team
