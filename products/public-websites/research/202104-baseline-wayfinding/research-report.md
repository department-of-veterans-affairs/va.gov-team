## Research Goals 
The purpose of this research is to get a baseline understanding of how the current VA.gov website is being used by Veterans and others. With a better understanding of Veterans' pain points and successes while using VA.gov, we can make more informed decisions about priorities for future research and design work in website navigation and tools.

## Research Methodology 

Description of method chosen

In this research study, wayfinding on VA.gov is being measured in terms of participants' success in doing the following set of typical Veteran tasks:
1. Ask your VA doctor a followup question (send a secure message)
1. Find out if your disability claim has been approved (track claim status)
1. Find the form to fill out to say that you want someone to be your representative in your disability claim appeal (form 21-22a Appointment of Individual As Claimant's Representative)
1. Update your bank information for disability compensation payments (change direct deposit)
1. Set up your travel to medical appointments to be reimbursed by direct deposit (direct deposit for VA travel pay reimbursement)
1. Find nearest VA hospital to a city you're planning to visit (find a VA location)
1. Get a document that shows the income you receive from the VA (download benefit letter or payment history)
1. Share VA medical history with a doctor outside the VA (get your VA medical records)
1. Tell the VA about your new spouse (add dependent)



### Who we talked to

We talked to **13** participants:
- 12 Veterans, including one who was also a caregiver for another Veteran
- 1 family member of a Veteran

Participants were on a variety of devices:
- 8 on a desktop/laptop computer
- 4 on a smartphone
- 1 on a tablet

One of the sessions was cut short due to technology issues, so most of the findings come from only 12 of the sessions.

## Key Findings
The 5-10 top findings from your study should be listed here. Write your findings so that if someone reads only these bullets they can leave feeling they got useful information and the study was worthwhile. Examples might be "Most participants used the Search field to find the form, and searched for the term 'veteran health'" or "Most participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form". See an example of this section [on the Caregiver findings document](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/1010cg-mvp/usability-testing-jan2020/research-findings.md).

1. Finding one
2. Finding two
3. Finding three
4. Finding four
5. Finding five
6. Finding six
7. Finding seven


## Details of Findings

Usage of the home page overall

Mobile vs. desktop differences

Navigation successes and issues

Tasks success rates and ratings

Difficulty with 3 tasks...
3. Find the form to fill out to say that you want someone to be your representative in your disability claim appeal (form 21-22a)
- 10 participants were looking for a place to find forms under "top 4 forms" > Disability and couldn't find it
- 3 participants had difficulty searching on the Find a Form page due to too many words in search query, resulting in no relevant results
- 2 participants mispelled "representative" on the Find a Form page, resulting in no relevant results

5. Set up your travel to medical appointments to be reimbursed by direct deposit (direct deposit for VA travel pay reimbursement)
- 4 were looking for "travel" in the healthcare section of VA Benefits and Health Care or in the "top 4" boxes
- 2 didn't notice the direct deposit link on the travel pay reimbursement page

8. Share VA medical history with a doctor outside the VA (get your VA medical records)
- 3 participants missed the CTA button at the top of the medical records page and got confused by Veterans Health Information Exchange pages re opting out
- 2 people were looking for medical records under health care, not records (maybe add a second link?)
- 2 people thought you couldn't send your VA medical records to an outside doctor or not sure how to do

### Usability Successes

#### Wayfinding
1. All participants were able to successfully complete 3 of the 9 tasks (#1, 2, 4), and most completed 3 more of the tasks (#6, 7, 9).
1. Most participants used the links in the "top 4" boxes extensively.
1. Half of the participants used the links in the left nav on content pages.

#### Content
1. All of the 5 participants who were shown the *Resources and support* page were able to use it to complete the relevant task. (See Usability Issue #4 below, which describes the difficulty in finding this page.)
1. Two participants noticed typeahead prompts while searching and used them.
1. The VA.gov home page worked well with a screen reader.


### Usability Issues

#### Wayfinding
1. Some participants were unable to successfully complete 3 of the tasks (#3, 5, 8), one of which was completed by very few participants (#3 form to appoint representative). 
1. The VA.gov home page is long, and many people stay focused on only one part of it (usually the "top 4" boxes), mostly not looking at anything else on the page. 
1. No participants started with site search (in the header of the home page), but some went there when they were unable to find any relevant links elsewhere on the home page. Some participants said that they didn't notice *Search* at first, but once they found it, a few used it in later tasks.
1. Most participants didn't find the *Resources and support* page on their own, though about half found the travel reimbursement direct deposit article via browsing or searching.
1. Most participants didn't find the *Find a VA form* page on their own, but once they saw it, they wanted easier access to it from the top of the home page.
1. Half of the participants never opened the *VA Benefits and Health Care* dropdown.
1. Half of the participants never scrolled down past the row of images on the home page.
1. One older participant (81 years old) had difficulty reading the font of the links in the "top 4" boxes.

#### Content
1. Four participants had a lot of difficulty searching on the *Find a VA form* page because they included too many words in the search query and/or misspelled a key word in the query ("representative").
1. Three participants complained about the COVID banner alert they kept seeing.

#### Other
1. Calling the VA is what many participants say they do if they can't find what they're looking for, but many try to avoid this because of long hold times, people unable to answer their questions, and frequent transfers to other people/departments.
