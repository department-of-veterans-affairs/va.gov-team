# Research Plan: Baseline Wayfinding Research on VA.gov 
 	
## Goals	
The purpose of this research is to get a baseline understanding of how the current VA.gov website is being used by Veterans and others. With a better understanding of Veterans' pain points and successes while using VA.gov, we can make more informed decisions about priorities for future design and research work.   

## Background
Since the current VA.gov website was launched in 2018, there hasn't been much user research on the website's overall design. Recent research studies have focused on specific search or browse pages but not on overall wayfinding. Analytics data indicate where people are clicking on pages and what search strings they try, but not whether they're finding what they're looking for. 

This research is planned within the context of the Public Websites team and the larger Unauthenticated crew, but it may also provide insights for the Authenticated teams and overall website information architecture.  

## Research questions
- Why do Veterans come to VA.gov? With what goals/tasks in mind?
- How do Veterans try to find what they’re looking for on VA.gov?
  - Where do they typically start? (Google/Facebook/MHV/eBenefits/VA.gov)
  - What do they typically do on VA.gov? What tools have they tried using?
    - Search (in header) and/or browse?
    - 4 white quadrants? Topics below the photos? Buttons below the topics? Footer links? Header links? Benefit Hubs (mega-menu dropdowns)?
    - Resources & Support? Find a Form? Find a Location? Find Yellow Ribbon school?
- Do they find what they're looking for? If not, what were they looking for?
- What pain points are there in terms of findability and usage?
- What works well?
- Are there any differences for desktop vs. mobile users?
- Do Veterans read/notice/click on the banner content on the home page?

## Hypotheses
- Veterans are focused on what they’re looking for and don’t want to navigate multiple tools unless it helps them get better results.
- Veterans don't care where the information they're looking for is stored, as long as they are able to find it.
- Veterans aren't aware of all the current search and browse tools on VA.gov. 	

## Method	
We will conduct remote moderated research sessions via Zoom using the Perigean contract. Participants will be asked a series of interview questions about their past usage of the VA.gov site and demonstrate some of what they've done, and then will be given some common Veteran tasks (pulled from [list compiled here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/research/Veteran%20Tasks%20on%20VA.gov.xlsx)) as prompts to explore the live VA.gov website.

We will also explore analytics data to see where people click on the VA.gov home page and compare usage statistics across the different search and browse tools on the site.

# RESUME WORKING HERE........................
 
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 	

## Participants and Recruitment	
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?	  
(Mention: Number of people, ages, accessibility preferences, geographical diversity, login requirements, VA benefit requirements, familiarity with technology, etc. Keep in mind, the more requirements, the more difficult the recruit, so give ample time to ensure the right participant mix.)	

Please list your participant criteria in two categories-
1. **Primary criteria / Must have** - what absolutely must be true in order to run your study? The clearer you can write this criteria, the easier it is to find matches for your study. (i.e. if your study will only work if you're talking to Veterans who have My HealtheVet premium accounts, mention that here. OR, if you are using a prototype tool that will not work well with screen readers, mention that as well.) 

2. **Secondary criteria / Would like to have** - what other criteria would strengthen your results?

- Any there any differences between people who have used VA.gov before and those you have not? (recruit for both)

*Pro tips for writing recruiting critera:* 
- If you have specific screener questions that YOU would ask a potential participant to determine eligibility for your study, list them here. For example, instead of saying "We want someone who has been to an urgent care facility recently", say "Have you been to an urgent care facility in the last 6 months? (Answer should be yes)"
- Do not assume that your recruiters or the participants know your products or requirements as well as you do. Provide links to products, clear descriptions, specifics, etc. 

2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 	
(If in person, describe how you will find participants. If remote, mention if you plan to draw from the existing recruiting contract - Perigean - or if there are other places where you would like to reach out to find participants specifically for this project. If you need help, please contact Research Contract Lead.)	

## When? 	
1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 	
(IF you are using the research recruiting contract, please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote, 2+ weeks for in person.) 	
2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.) 	
3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours. Specify if you want Perigean to schedule the sessions with buffer time (15 minutes recommended) to allow for participants who can't make it on time, or if you might go over time.
4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.	Specify how much time you want between sessions, if any.
5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 	
## Team Roles	
Please list the people who will be serving in each role. **Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker** 	
- Moderator:	
- Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):	
- Participant recruiting & screening:	
- Project point of contact:	
- Participant(s) for pilot test:	
- Note-takers:	
- Observers:	
**List email addresses for those who should attend and observe the sessions: VA Stakeholders, engineering team members, design team members, any other people who might find this research relevant to their work**
