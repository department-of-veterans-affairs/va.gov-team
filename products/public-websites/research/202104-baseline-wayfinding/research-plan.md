# Research Plan: Baseline Wayfinding Research on VA.gov 
 	
## Goals	
The purpose of this research is to get a baseline understanding of how the current VA.gov website is being used by Veterans and others. With a better understanding of Veterans' pain points and successes while using VA.gov, we can make more informed decisions about priorities for future research and design work in website navigation and tools.   

## Background
Since the current VA.gov website was launched in 2018, there hasn't been much user research on the website's overall design. Recent research studies have focused on specific search or browse pages but not on overall wayfinding. Analytics data indicate where people are clicking on pages and what search strings they try, but not whether they're finding what they're looking for. 

This research is planned within the context of the Public Websites team and the larger Unauthenticated crew, but it may also provide insights for the Authenticated teams and overall website information architecture.  

## Research questions
- How do Veterans accomplish a list of common tasks?
  - Where do they typically start? (Google/Facebook/MHV/eBenefits/contact center call or email/VA.gov)
  - If not using VA.gov, why? (e.g., don't know about it, too hard to use)
  - What do they typically do on VA.gov? What tools have they tried using?
    - Search (in header)
    - Benefit Hubs (mega-menu dropdowns in header under "VA Benefits and Health Care")
    - Other header links (About VA, Find a VA Location, Contact us)
    - 4 white quadrants
    - Topics below the photos
    - 3 red/blue buttons below the topics
    - Links below the 3 red/blue buttons
    - Footer links 
    - Resources & Support
    - Find a Form
- Do they find what they're looking for? If not, what were they looking for?
- What pain points are there in terms of findability and usage?
- What works well?
- What differences are there for desktop *vs.* smartphone users?
- What differences are there for people who have cognitive disabilities?
- What differences are there for people who use screen readers?
- What differences are there for people who have used VA.gov before *vs.* haven't used it?
- Do Veterans read/notice/click/comment on the banner content on the home page?

## Hypotheses
- Veterans are focused on what they’re looking for and don’t want to navigate multiple tools unless it helps them get better results.
- Veterans don't care where the information they're looking for is stored, as long as they are able to find it.
- Veterans aren't using all of the current search and browse tools on VA.gov. 	

## Method	
We will conduct remote moderated research sessions via Zoom. Participants will be asked a series of interview questions about their past usage of the VA.gov site and demonstrate some of what they've done, and then will be given some common Veteran tasks (pulled from [list compiled here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/research/Veteran%20Tasks%20on%20VA.gov.xlsx)) as wayfinding prompts to explore the live VA.gov website.

We will also explore analytics data to see where people click on the VA.gov home page and compare usage statistics across the different search and browse tools on the site.
