This topline summary is a high level, top-of-mind summary of trends observed in the research sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. *The information in this document may change, following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.*

**The goal of this document is as follows:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from the team/stakeholders and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Introduction
The purpose of this research is to get a baseline understanding of how the current VA.gov website is being used by Veterans and others. With a better understanding of Veterans' pain points and successes while using VA.gov, we can make more informed decisions about priorities for future research and design work in website navigation and tools.

In this research study, wayfinding on VA.gov is being measured in terms of participants' success in doing the following set of typical Veteran tasks:
1. Ask your VA doctor a followup question (send a secure message)
1. Find out if your disability claim has been approved (track claim status)
1. Find the form to fill out to say that you want someone to be your representative in your disability claim appeal (form 21-22a Appointment of Individual As Claimant's Representative)
1. Update your bank information for disability compensation payments (change direct deposit)
1. Set up your travel to medical appointments to be reimbursed by direct deposit (direct deposit for VA travel pay reimbursement)
1. Find nearest VA hospital to a city you're planning to visit (find a VA location)
1. Get a document that shows the income you receive from the VA (download benefit letter or payment history)
1. Share VA medical history with a doctor outside the VA (get your VA medical records)
1. Tell the VA about your new spouse (add dependent)

Since not all of the above tasks turned out to be easy to do from the VA.gov home page, there may be opportunities for improvement in navigation (which will be covered in the full research report). The full report will also include which parts of the home page were most/least used in the research sessions and analytics data, and any differences in mobile *vs.* desktop users.

## Participants
We talked to **13** participants:
- 12 Veterans, including one who was also a caregiver for another Veteran
- 1 family member of a Veteran

Participants were on a variety of devices:
- 8 on a desktop/laptop computer
- 4 on a smartphone
- 1 on a tablet

One of the sessions was cut short due to technology issues, so most of the findings come from only 12 of the sessions.

## Usability Successes

### Wayfinding
1. All participants were able to successfully complete 3 of the 9 tasks (#1, 2, 4), and most completed 3 more of the tasks (#6, 7, 9).
1. Most participants used the links in the "top 4" boxes extensively.
1. Half of the participants used the links in the left nav on content pages.

### Content
1. All of the 5 participants who were shown the *Resources and support* page were able to use it to complete the relevant task. (See Usability Issue #4 below, which describes the difficulty in finding this page.)
1. Two participants noticed typeahead prompts while searching and used them.
1. The VA.gov home page worked well with a screen reader.


## Usability Issues

### Wayfinding
1. Some participants were unable to successfully complete 3 of the tasks (#3, 5, 8), one of which was completed by very few participants (#3 form to appoint representative). 
1. The VA.gov home page is long, and many people stay focused on only one part of it (usually the "top 4" boxes), mostly not looking at anything else on the page. 
1. No participants started with site search (in the header of the home page), but some went there when they were unable to find any relevant links elsewhere on the home page. Some participants said that they didn't notice *Search* at first, but once they found it, a few used it in later tasks.
1. Most participants didn't find the *Resources and support* page on their own, though about half found the travel reimbursement direct deposit article via browsing or searching.
1. Most participants didn't find the *Find a VA form* page on their own, but once they saw it, they wanted easier access to it from the top of the home page.
1. Half of the participants never opened the *VA Benefits and Health Care* dropdown.
1. Half of the participants never scrolled down past the row of images on the home page.
1. One older participant (81 years old) had difficulty reading the font of the links in the "top 4" boxes.

### Content
1. Four participants had a lot of difficulty searching on the *Find a VA form* page because they included too many words in the search query and/or misspelled a key word in the query ("representative").
1. Three participants complained about the COVID banner alert they kept seeing.

### Other
1. Calling the VA is what many participants say they do if they can't find what they're looking for, but many try to avoid this because of long hold times, people unable to answer their questions, and frequent transfers to other people/departments.
