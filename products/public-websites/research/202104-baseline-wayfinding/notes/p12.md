_Start recording to the cloud._

* **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

**Warm-up Questions - 10 minutes**

Let's start with a few questions... _(Veteran / Caregiver; Phone / Computer; Notetaker: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_)_

* _(if using a screen reader)_ How would you rate your level of experience with using a screen reader--beginner, intermediate, advanced, or expert?
* Where do you typically go to get information and benefits from the VA?

I go to the VA in-person or I use MyHealthyVet.

  * _(Google / Facebook / MHV / eBenefits / Contact center call or email / VA.gov / \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_)_
* Can you tell me about the last time you were looking for information or trying to do something with your VA benefits?

I talked to a patient advocate the last time I was at the VA. She took down my information and told me she's look into what I talk to her about -- she called me back later.

  * I would like you to go to a specific website: VA.gov
  * Have you seen this website before? Have you used it before?

No, I have not seen this site before.

**Task 1: \[Message doctor\] - 4 minutes**

* Let's pretend that you had a doctor's appointment at the VA last week, and now you have a follow-up question for the doctor. How could you contact them?

I would click, "Use secure messaging." I'm familiar with this from MyHealthyVet.

* Could you please go to VA.gov and show me what you would do?
* Can you talk to me about how you got here? 
* How would you rate the ease of finding what you were looking for on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is _difficult_ and 5 is _easy_? And why?

5 -- everything is right there. It is broken down into 4 sections and each has the options for what you may be looking for.

**Task 2: \[Track claim status\] - 4 minutes**

* Say that you've already applied for disability compensation, and you want to find out if your claim has been approved. What could you do?

I would go back to the main screen (va.gov) and click, "Check your VA claim or appeal status." Pretty simple.

* Could you please go to VA.gov and show me what you would do?

_RECORD navigation:_

  * _Disability quadrant \> Check your claim or appeal status_
  * _VA Benefits & Health Care \> Disability \> Check claim/appeal status_
  * _(phone) Menu at top \> VA Benefits & Health Care \> ..._
  * _Disability link below photos_
  * _Search_
* Can you talk to me about how you got here? 
* How would you rate the ease of finding what you were looking for on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is _difficult_ and 5 is _easy_? And why?

5

**Task 3: \[Appoint a representative to help with your claim--Find form\] - 4 minutes**

* Pretend that you just found out that your disability claim was denied and you want to appeal. You know someone who has agreed to help you with that. How would you find the form to fill out to say that you want that person to be your representative?

I would go back again to the main page and click \*\*took longer to search\*\*...I don't see anything on here where you would ask for somebody's help. The "contact us" maybe. This one is more difficult to find -- there isn't anything on here that shows where you can go to get assistance like that. \*Asked: Is there anything else on the page that may help?\* The closest one would be the option on the bottom that says find a VA health facility, regional office..." \*Thought he was trying to find a representative\* If I were just trying to tell the VA that I have someone then I would go to VA forms. I would use the search feature and search, "assign a representative." \*no results found, then searched for "assign a representative for a denial claim"\* I don't see anything on here that will help me. From here, I would contact the regional office and ask them the name of the form that I need to fill out.

* Could you please go to VA.gov and show me what you would do?
* Can you talk to me about how you got here? 
* How would you rate the ease of finding what you were looking for on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is _difficult_ and 5 is _easy_? And why?
* I'd like you to go to another page, which I've put the link to in the chat 
  * Can you try using this page to help with the task?
  * How would you expect to get to this page from va.gov?

**Task 4: \[Update direct deposit\] - 4 minutes**

* Imagine that you just changed your bank. How would you update this information with the VA so that your disability compensation payments will go to your new bank instead of your old one?

I would go to the main page and look for something that says anything about changing my account information or bank information. \*Started by looking in "records" and kept returning to that section\* There is nothing on here except "view your payment history." \*clicked view payment history and say the instructions for how to change DD info -- clicked the link that is included\* There it is.

* Could you please go to VA.gov and show me what you would do?
* Can you talk to me about how you got here? 
* How would you rate the ease of finding what you were looking for on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is _difficult_ and 5 is _easy_? And why?

3 -- It is under payment history; you aren't looking for payment history when you are trying to change the information. I would've expected to have seen an option for it under "Records" and not in the "education" box.

**Task 5: \[Travel reimbursement direct deposit--R&S\] - 4 minutes**

* Now that you've updated your bank information for disability compensation, you want your travel to medical appointments to be reimbursed by direct deposit, too. How could you set that up?

I would go back to the 4 boxes on the main screen. I'd click, "schedule and manage your health appointments" because that has to do with traveling to your appointments. I don't see it here. I would go back to "view your payment history" again. I don't see it here either. \*Clicked, "find a VA health facility, regional office, or cemetery"\* There's nothing here either. If you weren't here, I would have to call the VA to ask how to do this.

* Could you please go to VA.gov and show me what you would do?
* _RECORD did they find the "How to set up direct deposit for VA travel pay reimbursement" article in R&S? yes / no_
* Can you talk to me about how you got here? 
* How would you rate the ease of finding what you were looking for on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is _difficult_ and 5 is _easy_? And why?

1, definitely. There is nothing that even remotely talks about that.

* I'd like you to go to another page, which I've put the link to in the chat 
  * Can you try using this page to help with the task?

I don't see anything on the page, so I would use the search. "Travel reimbursement to direct deposit" I would click, " How to set up direct deposit for travel pay reimbursement." Then I would click the blue button to open the form.

  * How would you expect to get to this page from va.gov?

I would have a section that is for setting up any type of direct deposit. I would want it to be under, "records." It could then be broken down once you open that -- retirement, disability pay, travel reimbursement.

**Task 6: \[Find a VA location\] - 4 minutes**

* I'd like you to imagine that you're planning a trip to another city, and you want to know where the nearest VA hospital is. How would you figure this out?

That's right on top of the page, that's easy. "Find a VA location."

* Could you please go to VA.gov and show me what you would do?
* Is there a way you might do it using VA.gov?
* Can you talk to me about how you got here? 
* How would you rate the ease of finding what you were looking for on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is _difficult_ and 5 is _easy_? And why?

5, very easy.

**Task 7: \[Get benefit letter\] - 4 minutes**

* Your mortgage lender has asked for proof of your income. How can you get a document that shows the income that you receive from the VA?

I would click, "download VA benefit letters." I've had to do that before.

* Could you please go to VA.gov and show me what you would do?
* Can you talk to me about how you got here?
* How would you rate the ease of finding what you were looking for on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is _difficult_ and 5 is _easy_? And why?

**Task 8: \[Get medical records\] - 4 minutes**

* You were just advised to see a doctor outside the VA, and their office asked for your medical history from the VA. How can you share that with them?

\*started by looking in the Health Care box then moved to Records. I would click the View Medical Records button and then I would use the Veteran Health Record Information Exchange.

* Could you please go to VA.gov and show me what you would do?
* Can you talk to me about how you got here? _(or why you chose to go straight to Search)_
* How would you rate the ease of finding what you were looking for on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is _difficult_ and 5 is _easy_? And why?

4, I second guessed it when I saw Get your VA medical records. It sounds like it is for YOU to get your records and not for you to SEND your records.

**Task 9: \[Update dependents\] - 4 minutes**

* Say that you just got married. How would you tell the VA about your new spouse?

\*looked in Records first\* The closest thing I see if change your address or get a VA card, because they are going to need one. I don't see anything other than that. At the bottom of the page, I'd click "Resources and support." It's hard to find anything that relates to that. I would use the search, "add spouse to VA compensation" but that wasn't helpful. I would call the regional office, I guess. Most of the time when I get stuck or have a question, I call the 1-800 number.

* Could you please go to VA.gov and show me what you would do?
* Can you talk to me about how you got here? 
* How would you rate the ease of finding what you were looking for on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is _difficult_ and 5 is _easy_? And why?

**Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes**

_Type into \#feedback-backchannel: "Any questions you want me to ask?"_

* What do you _like_ about using the VA.gov website?
* What do you _dislike_ about using VA.gov?

There's nothing that I dislike, but there are things that should be added to make it easier.

"View your payment history" is under Education and Disability, but it should be under Records.

* What would you like to _change_ about VA.gov?
* When you're unable to find what you're looking for on VA.gov, what do you do next?
* Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you think I should know?

**Thank You and Closing - 1 minute**

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on improving the VA website.
