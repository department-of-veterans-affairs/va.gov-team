**Conversation Guide: Baseline Wayfinding Research on VA.gov**

_Start recording to the cloud._

* **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

**Warm-up Questions - 10 minutes**

Let's start with a few questions... _(Veteran / Caregiver; Phone / Computer; Notetaker: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_)_

* _(if using a screen reader)_ How would you rate your level of experience with using a screen reader--beginner, intermediate, advanced, or expert?
* Where do you typically go to get information and benefits from the VA?

Usually either HealthyVet or the VA itself.

  * _(Google / Facebook / MHV / eBenefits / Contact center call or email / VA.gov / \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_)_
* Can you tell me about the last time you were looking for information or trying to do something with your VA benefits?

Two days ago -- I had to get a list of my medications for an MRI. I did it online through my phone -- HealthyVet.

I have used VA.gov to schedule appointments, check the status of my claims, check the status of my payments, and I've looked through it to get info on other benefits that are available.

**Veteran Tasks**

Now I'm going to ask you to do a number of things that you may or may not have done before. Please do these tasks on your computer or phone as you normally might if I weren't here. For each task, I will stop you at a point when I feel like we've done enough, and I won't ask you to sign in.

I would like you to _talk aloud_ as much as possible so that you share what you're thinking, what you're doing, what you like, what you dislike, and what you're unsure about.

**Task 1: \[Message doctor\] - 4 minutes**

* Let's pretend that you had a doctor's appointment at the VA last week, and now you have a follow-up question for the doctor. How could you contact them?

That's going to be "Send a secure message to my healthcare team." Next, I would sign in, using the MyHeathyVet account.

* Could you please go to VA.gov and show me what you would do?
* Can you talk to me about how you got here? 
* How would you rate the ease of finding what you were looking for on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is _difficult_ and 5 is _easy_? And why?

5, finding it is easy. The actual process of signing in -- I am not a fan of. The two-factor authentication makes it difficult. I don't have very good cell signal, so doing it with my phone is a 10-minute process where I have to stand in the yard where I can get signal. There should be a work around for that -- I can use my email for other two-factor authentications.

**Task 2: \[Track claim status\] - 4 minutes**

* Say that you've already applied for disability compensation, and you want to find out if your claim has been approved. What could you do?

"Check my claim or appeal status" -- once again I have to sign in from here.

* Could you please go to VA.gov and show me what you would do?

_RECORD navigation:_

  * _Disability quadrant \> Check your claim or appeal status_
  * _VA Benefits & Health Care \> Disability \> Check claim/appeal status_
  * _(phone) Menu at top \> VA Benefits & Health Care \> ..._
  * _Disability link below photos_
  * _Search_
* Can you talk to me about how you got here? 
* How would you rate the ease of finding what you were looking for on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is _difficult_ and 5 is _easy_? And why?

5, very easy -- but the same log in issue. Also, DS logon doesn't always work.

**Task 3: \[Appoint a representative to help with your claim--Find form\] - 4 minutes**

* Pretend that you just found out that your disability claim was denied and you want to appeal. You know someone who has agreed to help you with that. How would you find the form to fill out to say that you want that person to be your representative?

I'm going to have to dig for that. It is going to be under Disability. \*clicked on, the top link" then, "Claim status tool FAQs"\* Since I've looked a couple of places now, I'd probably call the 1-800 number. If I kept looking, I'd go through the rest of the Disability section. I'll scan the rest of the page to see if there's a link that says anything about getting help on a claim. \*tried one other link at very bottom of page\* At this point I would probably just call.

* Could you please go to VA.gov and show me what you would do?
* Can you talk to me about how you got here? 
* How would you rate the ease of finding what you were looking for on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is _difficult_ and 5 is _easy_? And why?

It was not easy at all; I was not able to find it. A 1\.

* I'd like you to go to another page, which I've put the link to in the chat 
  * Can you try using this page to help with the task?
  * How would you expect to get to this page from va.gov?

\*On VA.gov/find-forms\* \*searched, "representative" and found 21-22a\*

I would have liked to see a link to this page at the top of VA.gov. Either to the right of "Find a location" or above that next to the other search feature. Front and center is always easier -- I wouldn't want to have to go through the entire page to find that.

**Task 4: \[Update direct deposit\] - 4 minutes**

* Imagine that you just changed your bank. How would you update this information with the VA so that your disability compensation payments will go to your new bank instead of your old one?

\*Clicked, Disability near bottom of page -- then clicked, "Manage my disability benefits" then, "change my direct deposit information"\* here I am.

* Could you please go to VA.gov and show me what you would do?
* Can you talk to me about how you got here? 
* How would you rate the ease of finding what you were looking for on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is _difficult_ and 5 is _easy_? And why?

That's more of a 4 to me because if I am looking for this, I know it is a payment and it may take a minute for me to realize that it is under Disability. I think it is the best it can be because there isn't enough banking going on from this page to have an entire Banking or Payments tab.

**Task 5: \[Travel reimbursement direct deposit--R&S\] - 4 minutes**

* Now that you've updated your bank information for disability compensation, you want your travel to medical appointments to be reimbursed by direct deposit, too. How could you set that up?

I'm not sure because I don't get travel reimbursement. It will again probably be under Disability. \*Could not find it under Disability links after clicking through some -- then used main search bar, searched, "travel" and found it\*

* Could you please go to VA.gov and show me what you would do?
* _RECORD did they find the "How to set up direct deposit for VA travel pay reimbursement" article in R&S? yes / no_
* Can you talk to me about how you got here? 
* How would you rate the ease of finding what you were looking for on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is _difficult_ and 5 is _easy_? And why?

A 4\. It took me a minute to search through some stuff and then I had to find and use the search bar.

* I'd like you to go to another page, which I've put the link to in the chat 
  * Can you try using this page to help with the task?
  * How would you expect to get to this page from va.gov?

**Task 6: \[Find a VA location\] - 4 minutes**

* I'd like you to imagine that you're planning a trip to another city, and you want to know where the nearest VA hospital is. How would you figure this out?

\*"Find a VA facility..." link near bottom of page. Used search feature with no issues\*

* Could you please go to VA.gov and show me what you would do?
* Is there a way you might do it using VA.gov?
* Can you talk to me about how you got here? 
* How would you rate the ease of finding what you were looking for on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is _difficult_ and 5 is _easy_? And why?

This one was very easy because it had its own link. I've never used it before, but it stands out. This link is delineated very well with the geo-location icon.

**Task 7: \[Get benefit letter\] - 4 minutes**

* Your mortgage lender has asked for proof of your income. How can you get a document that shows the income that you receive from the VA?

I believe my benefit let will show that, but I'd have to look. \*Clicked, "View benefit letter" then clicked, "View VA payment history"\* I'm not sure if that will get me there -- I'd have to sing in and see if there is a printable form from there, I assume there would be.

* Could you please go to VA.gov and show me what you would do?
* Can you talk to me about how you got here?
* How would you rate the ease of finding what you were looking for on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is _difficult_ and 5 is _easy_? And why?

At this point I still don't know if I found it. If it isn't there, then it'd be a 1 or 2\. If it does have that info then it'd be a 3\.

**Task 8: \[Get medical records\] - 4 minutes**

* You were just advised to see a doctor outside the VA, and their office asked for your medical history from the VA. How can you share that with them?

I would normally do it through MyHealthyVet. I would use the Records link and then click the "Blue button" link.

* Could you please go to VA.gov and show me what you would do?
* Can you talk to me about how you got here? _(or why you chose to go straight to Search)_
* How would you rate the ease of finding what you were looking for on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is _difficult_ and 5 is _easy_? And why?

5

**Task 9: \[Update dependents\] - 4 minutes**

* Say that you just got married. How would you tell the VA about your new spouse?

\*clicked, Family member benefits"\* If I don't see anything here then I would use the "Ask a question online" or the search bar. \*Searched, "add spouse" and found the link\*

* Could you please go to VA.gov and show me what you would do?
* Can you talk to me about how you got here? 
* How would you rate the ease of finding what you were looking for on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is _difficult_ and 5 is _easy_? And why?

**Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes**

_Type into \#feedback-backchannel: "Any questions you want me to ask?"_

* What do you _like_ about using the VA.gov website?

I like the fact that I can usually get what I need. The sit is laid out well, it isn't cluttered.

* What do you _dislike_ about using VA.gov?

Two-factor authentication every time. There's a few organizational changes I would make to the site, for example being able to close the COVID info banner.

* When you're unable to find what you're looking for on VA.gov, what do you do next?

I would use the search function up top and if I still couldn't find it then I would go to Google. If I need to, I will call someone -- but I don't always like to do it because you often get messengers and I prefer to leave out the middleman when possible.

**Thank You and Closing - 1 minute**

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on improving the VA website.

Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day!
