_Start recording to the cloud._

* **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

**Warm-up Questions - 10 minutes**

Let's start with a few questions... _(Veteran / Caregiver; Phone / Computer; Notetaker: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_)_

* _(if using a screen reader)_ How would you rate your level of experience with using a screen reader--beginner, intermediate, advanced, or expert?
* Where do you typically go to get information and benefits from the VA?

I go to the local VA Hospital. \[medical center name redacted\] I also get emails from them and from other Veterans almost every day.

* Can you tell me about the last time you were looking for information or trying to do something with your VA benefits?

Yesterday via email I was sent some information. I usually look into whatever I get because I am part of the American Legion and I have a Navy Squadron website -- every day I try to stay updated. I can't remember what it was off the top of my head.

* Could you please share a blank browser window in Zoom with me?
  * _(If using a screen reader)_: Did you see a checkbox that says, "Share computer sound"? Please make sure it's checked so I'll be able to hear your screen reader.
  * I would like you to go to a specific website: VA.gov
  * Have you seen this website before? Have you used it before?

Yes, I've used it before. I used it about a week ago. I was looking at my appointment for next week to verify it. They're sending me to \[name redacted\] University, so I was also getting the reimbursement set up for that.

**Task 1: \[Message doctor\] - 4 minutes**

* Let's pretend that you had a doctor's appointment at the VA last week, and now you have a follow-up question for the doctor. How could you contact them?

You could go to "Send a secure message to your health care team" under Health Care. That would be the first thing I've tried. I have not tried to do this on the website before, I usually just call.

* Could you please go to VA.gov and show me what you would do?
* Can you talk to me about how you got here? 
* How would you rate the ease of finding what you were looking for on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is _difficult_ and 5 is _easy_? And why?

**Task 2: \[Track claim status\] - 4 minutes**

* Say that you've already applied for disability compensation, and you want to find out if your claim has been approved. What could you do?

There's a website other than this one -- I don't recall what it's called, but I have it favorited. It lets you track how your claim is doing, etc.... I'm already on disability so I haven't had to check it for a while.

I'd click the first link under Disability, "Check your appeal or claim status."

* Could you please go to VA.gov and show me what you would do?

_RECORD navigation:_

  * _Disability quadrant \> Check your claim or appeal status_
  * _VA Benefits & Health Care \> Disability \> Check claim/appeal status_
  * _(phone) Menu at top \> VA Benefits & Health Care \> ..._
  * _Disability link below photos_
  * _Search_
* Can you talk to me about how you got here? 
* How would you rate the ease of finding what you were looking for on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is _difficult_ and 5 is _easy_? And why?

**Task 3: \[Appoint a representative to help with your claim--Find form\] - 4 minutes**

* Pretend that you just found out that your disability claim was denied and you want to appeal. You know someone who has agreed to help you with that. How would you find the form to fill out to say that you want that person to be your representative?

You could use the "Upload evidence to support your claim" but that would go to the VA not to the Rep. \*Tried "File a disability claim"\* This just tells you how to do it. \*Explained that we are looking for a form\* I am not seeing anything, I'll scroll down. I see VA Forms at the very bottom, but it may take a while to find it in there. \*Clicked "File a VA disability form" under the search option\* I don't see a form here that would do it. You could try Accredited Claim Representatives -- no. You could try your VSO. \*Asked: Is there anything else you could try on this page?\* Nothing comes to mind.

I guess you could try to search for the form. I don't think I've ever tried to find a form without having the form number to look for. \*Searched, "Representative for claim"\* I'm still not seeing what I'd want. \*Changed search to, "Representative for claim filing"\* This still isn't what I'd want. \*realized it is for an appeal and changed it to, "Representative for claim appeal"\* I'm surprised that it is buried in these results, there's quite a few pages of results. \*Cindy: Try a shorter search query...Tried, "representative appeal"\* It's the first one here. \*Opened Form 21-22a\*

Having the word "claim" in my search should've made it pop up.

* Could you please go to VA.gov and show me what you would do?
* Can you talk to me about how you got here? 
* How would you rate the ease of finding what you were looking for on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is _difficult_ and 5 is _easy_? And why?
* I'd like you to go to another page, which I've put the link to in the chat 
  * Can you try using this page to help with the task?
  * How would you expect to get to this page from va.gov?

Probably a 2 or 3\. I'm pretty savvy on a computer and it took me a while to find it.

**Task 4: \[Update direct deposit\] - 4 minutes**

* Imagine that you just changed your bank. How would you update this information with the VA so that your disability compensation payments will go to your new bank instead of your old one?

\*Clicked, View VA payment history\* I'm not sure if it would be under here but let's see...Yes, here it is, I found it. You could either do it online or go to the VA.

* Could you please go to VA.gov and show me what you would do?
* Can you talk to me about how you got here? 
* How would you rate the ease of finding what you were looking for on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is _difficult_ and 5 is _easy_? And why?

**Task 5: \[Travel reimbursement direct deposit--R&S\] - 4 minutes**

* Now that you've updated your bank information for disability compensation, you want your travel to medical appointments to be reimbursed by direct deposit, too. How could you set that up?

\*Clicked, "File a claim for compensation."\* I actually have to do this next week -- normally I would take my receipt to the VA and they mail me a check. I'm not sure how to do it for Direct Deposit. I'd have to dig around on here to find it. I'd look for a "Travel" section, but I don't think there is one. I could use the search \*from main va.gov page, searched, "travel payment"\* It pops up that way. Clicked, "VA travel reimbursement" I'm not sure how to do the direct deposit from here.

* Could you please go to VA.gov and show me what you would do?
* _RECORD did they find the "How to set up direct deposit for VA travel pay reimbursement" article in R&S? yes / no_

\*Guided to the R&S page\* I don't see any verbiage about "travel."

\*Searched, "Travel" and found the link\*

* Can you talk to me about how you got here? 
* How would you rate the ease of finding what you were looking for on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is _difficult_ and 5 is _easy_? And why?

Probably a 2 or 3\. It wasn't difficult, just time consuming. There should just be a "travel" link on the main va.gov page. That link would have info for reimbursement, where you can travel to, how much reimbursement you could get, and when are you allowed to travel and when will you be reimbursed.

* I'd like you to go to another page, which I've put the link to in the chat 
  * Can you try using this page to help with the task?
  * How would you expect to get to this page from va.gov?

**Task 6: \[Find a VA location\] - 4 minutes**

* I'd like you to imagine that you're planning a trip to another city, and you want to know where the nearest VA hospital is. How would you figure this out?

I would use, "Find a VA location" at the top of the page. \*types in a zip code and chose facility type: hospital\*

* Could you please go to VA.gov and show me what you would do?
* Is there a way you might do it using VA.gov?
* Can you talk to me about how you got here? 
* How would you rate the ease of finding what you were looking for on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is _difficult_ and 5 is _easy_? And why?

5, it's as easy as it could be -- its right up top. 

**Task 7: \[Get benefit letter\] - 4 minutes**

* Your mortgage lender has asked for proof of your income. How can you get a document that shows the income that you receive from the VA?

\*Clicked, View your VA payment history\*

* Could you please go to VA.gov and show me what you would do?
* Can you talk to me about how you got here?
* How would you rate the ease of finding what you were looking for on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is _difficult_ and 5 is _easy_? And why?

5

**Task 8: \[Get medical records\] - 4 minutes**

* You were just advised to see a doctor outside the VA, and their office asked for your medical history from the VA. How can you share that with them?

You can't. As of 2-3 years ago the VA stopped allowing the sharing of information back and forth unless you sign a letter that says you can release it to the doctor. I don't think you can do it here; I'd be surprised if you can.

\*Clicked, view your VA medical history\*

This is it right here -- VHIE. It says you can but that you can also opt out of it.

* Could you please go to VA.gov and show me what you would do?
* Can you talk to me about how you got here? _(or why you chose to go straight to Search)_
* How would you rate the ease of finding what you were looking for on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is _difficult_ and 5 is _easy_? And why?

4 -- I had to go to a couple places to get to it.

**Task 9: \[Update dependents\] - 4 minutes**

* Say that you just got married. How would you tell the VA about your new spouse?

\*Clicked, "How to file a VA disability claim"\* \*searched\* It is under Disability, Add dependents to your VA disability benefits.

* Could you please go to VA.gov and show me what you would do?
* Can you talk to me about how you got here? 
* How would you rate the ease of finding what you were looking for on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is _difficult_ and 5 is _easy_? And why?

5, it was easy once I searched.

**Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes**

_Type into \#feedback-backchannel: "Any questions you want me to ask?"_

* What do you _like_ about using the VA.gov website?

I like that you can do it right here instead of having to wait on hold on the phone.

* What do you _dislike_ about using VA.gov?

Nothing

* What would you like to _change_ about VA.gov?

A couple things. I'd like to rearrange the way some of this is displayed. I don't know when it was last updated, but maybe that needs to happen -- although some of the pages have COVID info so they've done some recent modifications.

* When you're unable to find what you're looking for on VA.gov, what do you do next?

If I couldn't find it, I would go to Google. If I couldn't find it there then I would get a hold of my VSO -- I talk to him every month already, but I would just call him.

* Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you think I should know?

**Thank You and Closing - 1 minute**

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on improving the VA website.
