# Content Ticketing Process

If you have a URL (or multiple URLs) that need to be redirected, please request the redirect via an issue in Zenhub in the ```va.gov-team repo```. 

All redirects will be routed through Content and IA team for validation and then assigned to the appropriate technical team for implementation. 

**Redirects must be requested *at least* 2 weeks in advance to ensure they are properly vetted and an implementation approach can be identified. However, some redirects may take longer to implement (weeks to months), so it is highly encouraged that requests are submitted as soon as you are aware that you will need one.**

1. Create an issue using the standard issue template

2. Title the issue "Redirect Request: [name of page/description of pages]"

3. Include the date redirects need to be implemented by

4. Include background and reason for redirect request

5. Document the current URL and where the URL should be redirected to.  Example:

Current Page/URL  |  Redirect to
---  |  ---
www.va.gov/HEALTHBENEFITS/access/index.asp | www.va.gov/health-care/

6. Please tag the issue with:
- Content and IA team labels  - `content-ia-team` and `ia` 
- Label used by your team (for example, ```BAH-526``` ```GI Bill Comparison Tool``` ```vsa-benefits-memorial```)
- Assign issue to @mnorthuis, @meganhkelley
