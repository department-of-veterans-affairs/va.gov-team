# Process for new product landing page

**1. Fill out intake form.**

**2. Meet with PW team to kick off work.**

We'll ask you these questions during kickoff:

- Who are the SMEs you're working with on this project, and who needs to approve?
- What's the estimated launch date?
- Will you need a REACT sign-in widget? 
- Do you anticipate a need for password-protecting the landing page for UAT testing and/or a phased rollout of the landing page? (If yes, we'll connect you with our PW engineers for guidance. Your team is responsibie for any flipper implementation and monitoring).

**3. Provide all information gathered to date.**

**4. Invite PW content representative to usability testing.**
