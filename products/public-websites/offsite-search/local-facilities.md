## Local VA Facilities Listing

### Problem Statement

Veterans using Google, Bing, Facebook and other popular "discovery engines" for local VA health and service facilities may find the experience unfulfilling -- and frustrating -- given the lack of data and information quality across the search ecosystem.   This quality issue is the result of three factors:

- There is no strong governance and quality management of VA local facility information-data (including for Health facilties, Vet Centers and VA benefits offices)
- The local search space is expanding and evolving (e.g. Facebook search, Alexa voice) and its tough to keep up without focused, expert effort
- The value of local search in delivering "better veteran outcomes" is not well understood/defined.

### What We Did

To better understand the problem -- and the promise -- for VA and local search, we conducted research to determine (a) VA's local search "standing" and (b) options for improvement.
