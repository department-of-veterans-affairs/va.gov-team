## Local VA Facilities Listing

### Problem Statement

Veterans using Google, Bing, Facebook and other popular "discovery engines" for local VA health and service facilities may find the experience unfulfilling -- and frustrating -- given the lack of data and information quality across the search ecosystem.   This quality issue is the result of three factors:

- There is no strong governance and quality management of VA local facility information-data (including for Health facilties, Vet Centers and VA benefits offices)
- The local search space is expanding and evolving (e.g. Facebook search, Alexa voice) and it is difficult to keep up without focused, expert effort
- The value of local search in delivering "better veteran outcomes" is not well understood/defined.

### What We Did

To better understand the problem -- and the promise -- for VA and local search, we conducted research to determine (a) VA's local search "standing" and (b) options for improvement.

Our findings:

1. A vendor audit of VA local listing presence across the discovery ecosystem -- including Google, Bing, Yelp, Yahoo, MapQuest and others -- found that there are an abundance of name, address and phone number mis-matches for VA health facilities. This inconsistency of key data elements could result in veteran confusion -- and negatively impacts how Google treats VA location listings (e.g. the more consistent entity information is, the more likely that entity will be featured as a Google knowledge panel search result).

2. The HTML structure of the new VAMC site template (https://www.va.gov/pittsburgh-health-care/locations/pittsburgh-va-medical-center-university-drive/) is not fully optimized for local search and [Google search rich results](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data).  

3. VA is not taking advantage of free local listings offerings from Google (Google My Business) and Bing (Bing Places for Business), both of which could improve
