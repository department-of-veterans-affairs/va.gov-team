MVP 2.0 [Desktop](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/P4W04QPWHTK) and [Mobile](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/36W0CAZHJ2U) prototypes created. Mobile version only contains screens demonstrating the different layout and search criteria presentation for smaller screen sizes

### Feedback & Outcomes

#### Yellow Ribbon a11y

Meeting date: 02/20/2020

#### Yellow Ribbon Sync

Meeting date: 02/19/2020  
Attendees: Liz Lantz, Kelson Adams, Anne Hurley, and Jennifer Lee

Outcomes

- Adding additional calls-to-action on each card to provide students w/ clear access to eligibility and application info for Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits
- Anne will work on recommendations for incorporating our MVP into the benefit hub page, and incorporating eligibility and application info for Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to our MVP landing page ([see GH Issue 6016](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/6016))

#### Yellow Ribbon Headings Discussion

Meeting date: 02/14/2020  
Attendees: Liz Lantz, Trevor Pierce

Outcomes

- Updating headings on Yellow Ribbon to improve screen reader experience ([mock-up here](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/P4W04QPWHTK#/405289244_Results_-__dev_Notes))

  - H1 will change on Search results page, and include a screen-reader only span with number of results

## Iteration 4 - Sprint 14

### Designs

[Iterations on designs](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/9SVV3Y8MBDP) with post-research feedback incorporated


### Feedback & Outcomes

#### Key research findings and recommendations :

Meeting date: 02/11/2020  
Attendees: Liz Lantz, Nick Sullivan, Kelson Adams, Anne Hurley, Jennifer Lee, and Mickin Sahni

Outcomes

- Research findings updated with detailed [recommendations](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/yellow-ribbon-mvp/research/research-findings.md#recommendations) and [next steps](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/yellow-ribbon-mvp/research/research-findings.md#next-steps) based on decisions made during this meeting
- Most significant changes
  - Team decision to remove comparison functionality from MVP; keep as a stretch goal
  - Need to update search criteria to better differentiate location options
  - Adding filter/search criteria to allow users to see only schools offering unlimited funding to unlimited students
  - Improving labels and language throughout prototype to reduce ambiguity
  - Due to lack of quality data, we decided to remove `degree type` and `program or school` information from the MVP
  - Adding `school website` as a data point for each school, to provide users with a next step

Resources

- Jen suggested to review REI's comparison functionality for a non-sticky option, when we do move forward with comparison functionality.  [Awaiting more info](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C52CL1PKQ/p1581521770073100)

### Feedback & Outcomes

#### Pre-Usability Design Review with VSP 

Meeting occurred asynchronously beginning 01/24/2020

Outcomes

- Updated comparison table 
  - `remove` button from a red `X` icon, to the word `Remove` presented as a text link, to eliminate ambiguity about the functionality
  - Update background color on table heading from blue to gray to help users understand the header is not interactive
- Use Source Sans Pro instead of Bitter in the comparison button since it is not a heading
- Revisit overall styling and color of button/bar to access comparison list
- Explored alternative placements for the `Add to compare` button in the card to eliminate awkward spacing. Reorganized cards so that the data is presented in 2 columns w/ 2 rows, and the button lives underneath each row (screenshot available in [GH issue #5182](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/5182))
- Made several copy updates based on content review, details available in [GH issue 4881](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/4881)
- Update label for `Displaying x of xx` from `results` to `schools` for clarity
- 

Resources

- Suggestion to explore alternate presentations for comparison functionality, such as the behavior on Samsung's website https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/phones/galaxy-s/?model_family=Galaxy+Note10%2B+5G,Galaxy+S10+5G

#### Yellow Ribbon Team Alignment / Present Hi-fis to team :

Meeting date: 01/22/2020  
Attendees: Liz Lantz, Nick Sullivan, Kelson Adams, Anne Hurley, Jennifer Lee, Mickin Sahni, Kara Kemahli 

Outcomes

- Reviewed MVP and research plan with team - all present agreed with way forward
- Team alignment on "why aren't we re-building the GIBCT?"
  - Legacy content must be migrated to va.gov
  - Another team works on that product
  - Their timeline is unknown, and typically much further out
  - We are in a position to quickly provide an improved FE experience for Yellow Ribbon data to Veterans
- Created draft product outline; Jennifer Lee and PM's to contribute to remaining sections (requirements, objectives, tracking, etc)

Resources

- [Mural board for product outline collaboration](https://app.mural.co/invitation/mural/vsa8243/1579702104127?sender=lizlantz1528&key=9bc900c5-957e-4a0b-988a-444b31ec1005)
- [Draft product outline created](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/yellow-ribbon-mvp/yellow-ribbon-mvp-product-brief.md)

#### Yellow Ribbon Team Alignment / Present Hi-fis to team :

Meeting date: 01/21/2020  
Attendees: Liz Lantz, Kevin Hoffman, Ryan Thurlwell, Crystabel Reiter

Outcomes

- Ryan shared new layout for cards to be incorporated in the design system. Asked for the following changes
  - Only non-default body text typography treatment permitted  in cards is an `h3` element for the card title
  - Remove icons for location
- In his card layouts, he presented call-to-actions as a list, instead of a button as shown with our `Add to compare` function.  Discussed usage of button for single calls-to-action that trigger a behavior in the UI, vs send the user to a new page, and agreed we can move forward w/ the existing design for now (using compare button instead of a link)

#### VSP Design Intent Collaboration:

Meeting date: 01/06/2020  
Attendees: Liz Lantz, Emily Waggoner, Crystabel Reiter, Trevor Pierce, Kevin Hoffman, Peggy Gannon, Mikki Northius

Outcomes

- Overall direction is appropriate; no major changes to flow or UI
- [Meeting recording posted in Slack](https://dsva.slack.com/files/UNP30MT7W/FRYERPLJW/zoom_0.mp4); feedback added to [Github Issue #4470](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/4470#event-2915928451), Feedback was discussed in comments
  - After discussing w/ product team, decided to stick with card over tabular presentation of search results to be consistent w/ similar experiences on VA.gov, and designer feels a card list is a more appropriate presentation for search results than a data table.
  - To eliminate accessibility concerns, we will remove the comparison drawer feature, and instead display comparison results on it's own page
  - Content team provided updates to copy which will be reflected in the next iteration
