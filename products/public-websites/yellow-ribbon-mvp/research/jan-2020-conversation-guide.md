# Yellow Ribbon School Finder Conversation Guide for Moderated Research

## Moderator logistics

*Use [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.*

*Before the session, send out the [observer instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/during-research/howto-observer-instructions.md) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into #feedback-backchannel).*

*In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute*

*In the Audio section, click the drop-down arrow and make sure "Play Entry/Exit Chimes" is unchecked*

*Check your [screensharing setup]*

*When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

### Project-specific setup

- [ ] Open the prototype in a new tab (link to come)
- [ ] Open the Yellow Ribbon page in your browser (https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/post-9-11/yellow-ribbon-program/)
- [ ] Begin screen sharing

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liz Lantz and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about Yellow Ribbon education benefits, and how you, as someone eligible to receive them, understand your benefits and go about using them.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 40 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.  The more you can think out loud and share what you're thinking as you go through the session, the better.
-  **You'll be interacting with an interactive prototype.** This is means it may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?" 

## Warm-up Questions  - 10 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

### For participants who have already used the Yellow Ribbon benefit:

- I understand you've used your education benefits, which is great. Are you currently in school?
- Where are/did you going to school, and what degree?
- I'd love to hear about your research and decision process once you knew you wanted to go to school.
  - What stage of your military service were you in when you decided to go to school?
  - How many schools did you apply to?
  - Do you recall the factors that made you want to apply to a specific school? 
  - Why did you choose that school, and area of study?
  - I understand you've used the Yellow Ribbon benefit. Tell me how that benefit works.
  - How did Yellow Ribbon benefits play into your decision?
  - What specific methods did you use to research schools, and your VA education benefits?

### For participants who are in the process of researching their education benefits:

- I understand you're considering going to school, and using your VA education benefits. That's great! Where are you in that process?
- Do you know what you want to study?
- I'd love to hear about your research and decision process so far.
  - What stage of your military service were you in when you decided to go to school?
  - How many schools are you planning on applying to?
  - What factors make you want to apply to a specific school?
  - How have you done your research on schools so far? 
  - How about research on education benefits available to you?
  - Have you encountered anything that made it harder, or easier, to do this research?
  - Are you familiar with the Yellow Ribbon benefit? Tell me how it works.
  - How does it fit into your decision making process?

###For all participants:

- How did you first learn what VA education benefits were available to you, and how Yellow Ribbon fit into those benefits?
- Were there any parts of the process that were particurlarly confusing? If so, how did you get clarification?
- Imagine I don't know anything about VA benefits. Can you tell me how the Yellow Ribbon program works?



We're almost ready to move to the prototype now, and I'll ask you to do a few tasks related to finding schools and understanding Yellow Ribbon benefits. Before we jump in, can you tell me where you would typically conduct this type of research?


## First Task: Find relevant schools in legacy Yellow Ribbon tables - 5 minutes

- Start on Yellow Ribbon benefit hub page.
- Find a school they're interested in, and tell me the Yellow Ribbon benefit information for that school
  - *If participant is interested in a state with a very small number of rows, once they have completed the task, ask them to react to a state like California with numerous rows.*

### Things to watch for:

- How does the participant understand and navigate the accordion pattern?
- How does the participant navigate the table on the state page? (Ctrl+f, manual scroll, etc)
- What emotions/thoughts does the participant verbalize while looking at a table presentation of this data?

## Second Task: Conduct a search in prototype - 5  minutes
- Go to the other tab we opened earlier, with the prototype.
- Take a look at the content on this page. Tell me what you think this page is for, what you can do here. You can scroll up and down, but don't click on anything just yet.  Think aloud as you look.
- What are your thoughts on the search criteria?
- Let's imagine you live in California, and you're interested in finding an in-state school for a Bachelor's degree. Go ahead and see if you can find that.

- After results are presented:

  - Again, take a look at the content on this page. Don't click on anything just yet.  Tell me what you're looking at, what you can do here.  Think aloud as you look.
  - Imagine you wanted to see this list in a different order, such has highest benefit amount first. How would you do that?
  - Does the information about each school feel complete to you?
  - Is the meaning of each piece of information in the card clear to you?
  - If you wanted to see the next set of schools, how would you do that?

### Things to watch for:

- Does the particpant understand what this tool is for?

- How does the participant react to the search criteria fields required to begin?

- After results are presented:

  - Does the participant notice without being prompted that they can sort the search results? Reaction to sort options?
  - Can the participant comfortably read the information presented in the cards?
  - Does the participant understand the information, specifically the number of students?
  - Does the participant notice the Add to Compare button?

  

## Third Task: Compare schools and change criteria - 8 minutes

- Let's say you're interested in [School A, School B, and School C] , and you want to see which one offers Yellow Ribbon to the most students.  How would you do that?
  - *If student does not use add to compare button and make their way to the comparison table, guide them there*
- Tell me about this screen - what do you see here, what do you think you can do?
- What are your thoughts on the way this information is presented?
- If you wanted to update this list somehow, how would you do that?
- Now that you have this information about these schools, what would your next step be?
- Imagine you want to go back and search for something different, maybe a specific school, or a different kind of degree.  How would you do that?

### Things to watch for:

- Why didn't they notice the Add to compare button?
- How many schools does the participant want to compare?
- Which data points is the participant most interested in comparing?
- Does the participant understand how to update their comparison?
- What would the participants next step be, once they have all the information about the school they're interested in?
- Does the participant understand how to start a new search?

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- Do you have any other thoughts or feedback you haven't had a chance to share yet?
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research sesson? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
