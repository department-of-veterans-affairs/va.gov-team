# CMS content / functionality


## Benefits Hub Landing Page

**What is:**

Veterans are eligible for a variety of Benefits, e.g. healthcare, education, pension, burial, etc. This Drupal content type holds overview content for each benefit, and links to drill down into specifics for applying for / managing that benefit.

**Example content:**
* URL: [https://www.va.gov/health-care/](https://www.va.gov/health-care/) 
* CMS: [https://staging.cms.va.gov/health-care](https://staging.cms.va.gov/health-care) 

**Governance / Editor guidance:**
* Primary editors: Sitewide Content team

Benefits hubs / detail pages feature strongly in the VA.gov header (aka the “mega-menu”)

* [VFS Product Directory: Benefits Hubs](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/benefits-hubs)


## Benefits Detail Page 

**What is:**

Page that contains detail about each Benefit, linked primarily from Benefit Hubs, e.g. how to apply, managing your benefit, or benefit-specific details. 

The content model is flexible to accommodate various types of content, using Drupal’s “paragraph” functionality, which allows insertion of accordion groups, link lists, alerts, process lists, Q&A (separate from Q&A node concept), images, etc. 

**Example content:**
* URL: [https://www.va.gov/health-care/about-va-health-benefits/](https://www.va.gov/health-care/about-va-health-benefits/) 
* CMS: [https://staging.cms.va.gov/health-care/about-va-health-benefits](https://staging.cms.va.gov/health-care/about-va-health-benefits) 

**Governance / Editor guidance:**
* Primary editors: Sitewide Content team

## Campaign Landing Pages (CLP)

**What is:**
[Product brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/campaign-landing-page)
The Campaign Landing Page (CLP) is a page builder in the VA.gov Drupal CMS which enables VA businesses to create, launch and manage modern, mobile-responsive, accessibility-optimized campaign landing pages to promote marketing or engagement content.

Campaign Landing Pages are intended to prevent creation of standalone marketing sites, and to create a rich experience for topics that are not otherwise Veterans benefit / facility related content.

[Runbook to create](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/campaign-landing-page#runbook-for-clp-creation)

**Example content:**
* URL: [https://www.va.gov/initiatives/vote/](https://www.va.gov/initiatives/vote/) 
* CMS: [https://staging.cms.va.gov/initiatives/vote](https://staging.cms.va.gov/initiatives/vote)

* [VFS Product Directory: Campaign Landing Page](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/campaign-landing-page)


## Events List

**What is:**

Template that displays chronological list of Events published to that list. There are two types of events lists: those that are associated with National VA (Outreach & Events hub) and those associated with specific VA Medical Center (VAMC) facilities.

Events / lists may only be managed by editors with permissions for that specific VAMC facility or office (aka “Section").

Events filters are available on Lists, to filter by past, future, or specific date(s). (Filters may also be referred to as “V2 filters”.)  Most common events lists:

**Outreach & Events hub** - typically online events, not location specific 
* URL: [https://www.va.gov/outreach-and-events/events/](https://www.va.gov/outreach-and-events/events/)
* CMS: [https://staging.cms.va.gov/outreach-and-events/events](https://staging.cms.va.gov/outreach-and-events/events) 
* Primary editors: VEO (Veteran Experience Office) editors

**VAMC Events** - example location: 
* URL: [https://www.va.gov/minneapolis-health-care/events/](https://www.va.gov/minneapolis-health-care/events/) 
* CMS: [https://staging.cms.va.gov/minneapolis-health-care/events](https://staging.cms.va.gov/minneapolis-health-care/events) 
* Primary editors:  VAMC editors have permissions to edit Events within their VAMC pages

* [VFS Product Directory: Outreach Events Hub & Calendar](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/outreach-events-hub-and-calendar)


## Event (detail page)

**What is:**
The event detail page, which is created via Drupal content type for online or in-person events like support groups, outreach events, public lectures, pickleball games and more.

Events must be associated with an Events list, which governs permissions for editing and presentation in the front-end for veterans. 

Events may be single or recurring, and are either: 
* At a VA facility
* At a non-VA location
* Online

**Outreach & Events event** - typically online events, not location specific 
* URL: [https://www.va.gov/outreach-and-events/events/48074/](https://www.va.gov/outreach-and-events/events/48074/) 
* CMS: [https://staging.cms.va.gov/outreach-and-events/events/48074](https://staging.cms.va.gov/outreach-and-events/events/48074) 
* Primary editors: VAMC editors have permissions to edit Events within their VAMC pages

**VAMC Events -**
* URL: [https://www.va.gov/minneapolis-health-care/events/47981/](https://www.va.gov/minneapolis-health-care/events/47981/) (recurring)
* CMS: [https://staging.cms.va.gov/minneapolis-health-care/events/47981](https://staging.cms.va.gov/minneapolis-health-care/events/47981) 
* Primary editors:  VEO editors

**More info:**
* A6 program GDrive folder: [Events](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1wGqhMBGs-baLOFarU2Jgii8Pz2IFIas6)
* Recurring events failed to launch twice in 2021, and launched successfully in Q2 2022: [https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/1956](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/1956) 
   * Event recurrences are tricky to manage in terms of listing / filtering logic, and Q3 2022, PW team is working to close out backlog of related bugs.



## Find a form / VA Forms

[Topic Dive overview of the Forms product](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/sitewide/topic-dives/README.md#71024---find-a-form), end to end

Forms product & engineering documentation: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/find-a-va-form

**What is:**

Forms are a critical part of the Veteran experience for applying for benefits & services. A Forms database is managed outside the context of Public Websites team or the Drupal CMS, and is the source of truth for Form data and PDFs. We import data from the Forms DB, and store data about each form as a node.

Forms are then findable from the “[Find a form](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/)” interface – a search / listing of VA Forms results.

**Example content:**
* Find a Form: [https://www.va.gov/find-forms/](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/) 
* Example Form URL: [https://va.gov/find-forms/about-form-10-0388-4](https://va.gov/find-forms/about-form-10-0388-4)   
* CMS VA Form node: [https://staging.cms.va.gov/node/6150/edit](https://staging.cms.va.gov/node/6150/edit)

**More info:**
* [Forms Product outline & historical docs](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/find-a-va-form)
* [Triage runbook](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/README.md#troubleshooting) for errors / defects
* [Engineering information](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/find-a-va-form/engineering) including data diagrams, architecture information

* [VA Forms Library Overview ](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/va-forms-library-overview)(Platform docs) - IS NOT RELATED. This pertains, instead, to making usable online forms within VA.gov 

## Announcement Framework

**What is:**
Announcements are reusable components that give a common way to make full page announcements on VA.gov.  They are designed to be configurable site-wide without messing with the source code of other applications or digging into Metalsmith layout files to conditionally render.

<img width="1167" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61624970/218570338-9e1728ce-db6b-4639-aa4c-926225f4db42.png">

Using a shared format and config file, developers are able to quickly create new announcements and easily implement rules for when and on what pages they should be displayed.  The config file is located in vets-website at `src/platform/site-wide/announcements/config/index.js` and an example config looks like this:

```
announcements: [
  {
    name: 'new-homepage',
    // Homepage only
    paths: /^\/$/,
    component: HomepageRedesignModal,
    disabled: false,
    show: AnnouncementBehavior.SHOW_ONCE_PER_SESSION,
    returnFocusDivContent: 'Current Homepage',
  },
],
```

New announcement components should be built in the announcements components directory (`src/platform/site-wide/announcements/components`), although the announcement framework allows any React component in vets-website to be used.

The `announcement` property in the rendered component will contain the announcement as stored in the config, so in this case `announcement.name` will render `New Education Feature`.

The `show` property can be set to one of 3 values defined in the AnnouncementBehavior enum constant, which are SHOW_ONCE, SHOW_EVERY_TIME and SHOW_ONCE_PER_SESSION. The SHOW_ONCE option persists to `localStorage`, the SHOW_ONCE_PER_SESSION persists to the `sessionStorage` and the SHOW_EVERY_TIME does not persist dismissal at all.

Architecture:

The Announcement entry point uses React to bind to an element inside an announcement-root div at the top of the page body.  It renders an empty div in its place when there is no announcement to show.  Placing the Announcement div at the top of the html body allows focus to be directed to the skip-link element of the page on modal close, allowing for an accessible user experience.

## Promo Banner

**What is:**

A promo banner is fixed content at the bottom of the viewport used for dismissible announcements such as new tools, news, etc.

Currently, www.va.gov supports three types of promo banners:
1. **Benefit announcements**, which relate to content focused on benefits: a new tool, a new online benefit application, etc.
2. **Email signups**, which relate to email signups for various VA updates / alerts / communications.
3. **News stories**, which relate to newly received or noteworthy information about the VA.

You can read more about these promo types in the [VA Design System](https://design.va.gov/components/banner/promo) or read more about Promo Banners in the [Knowledge Base](https://prod.cms.va.gov/node/39828).

## Outreach Materials Library (Publication Listing Page) / Publications

**What is:**
Currently there is one Publication Listing Page, the Outreach Library, where all Publications appear.
Not modified since launch.

As of Aug 2023, there is intent to deprecate the Outreach Materials Library: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/14835. A new product is being built by OPIA / VEO platform (tentative name: Discover). When that product launches, O&M Library will be removed.

**Example content:**
* URL: [https://www.va.gov/outreach-and-events/outreach-materials/](https://www.va.gov/outreach-and-events/outreach-materials/) 
* CMS: [https://staging.cms.va.gov/node/412/edit](https://staging.cms.va.gov/node/412/edit) 

**Governance / Editor guidance:**
* Primary editors: Sitewide Content team

## Resources and support
Resources & Support is a broad category of content managed by CAIA (Sitewide Content Accessibility & IA team). R&S content on VA.gov all appear within the https://www.va.gov/resources/ area of the site, and use the `/resources` path. However, within Drupal, content in this area can be created using multiple different content types, including (in order of usage): 
* FAQ
* Resources & Support Detail pages
* Reusable Q&A
* Image list
* Media list
* Checklist
* Support service

### FAQ page

**What is:**

A Drupal content type that is used to aggregate [Q&A nodes](#qa---single). Often published with a URL path in /resources/, indistinguishable to front-end users from other [Resources & Support](#resources-and-support-detail-page) content.

**Example content:**
* URL: [https://va.gov/resources/signing-in-to-vagov](https://va.gov/resources/signing-in-to-vagov) 
* CMS: [https://staging.cms.va.gov/resources/signing-in-to-vagov](https://staging.cms.va.gov/resources/signing-in-to-vagov) 

**Governance / Editor guidance:**

### Resources and support Detail Page

**What is:**

A page that contains in-depth information about a single resource available to Veterans or other beneficiaries. Formerly called Learning Centers.

**Example content:**
* URL: [https://va.gov/resources/choosing-between-urgent-and-emergency-care](https://va.gov/resources/choosing-between-urgent-and-emergency-care) 
* CMS: [https://staging.cms.va.gov/node/37196/edit](https://staging.cms.va.gov/node/37196/edit) 

**Governance / Editor guidance:**
* Primary editors: Sitewide Content team, for now. Goal: to expand to Editors in other areas.

* [VFS Product Directory: Resources & Support](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/resources-support)

### Reusable Q&A

**What is:**

A Question / Answer node type. Prior to the creation of this node type, Q&A data could be / was entered in Drupal “paragraphs”, but was not reusable (with edge case exceptions). Q&A nodes, on the other hand, can be referenced on additional node types such as Resources & Support or FAQ pages, making them reusable.

Q&As may be used as an entity reference on:
* Campaign Landing Pages
* Benefits Detail Pages
* FAQ page
* Resources & Support pages

They may also have a standalone Resources and Support page (/resources/). (Not typical.)

**Example content:**
* URL: [https://www.va.gov/resources/gi-bill-and-other-va-education-benefit-payments-faqs/#:~:text=When%20will%20I%20get%20my,way%20to%20receive%20your%20payment](https://www.va.gov/resources/gi-bill-and-other-va-education-benefit-payments-faqs/#:~:text=When%20will%20I%20get%20my,way%20to%20receive%20your%20payment) – Q&A appears on FAQ page
* CMS: 
  * Q&A node: [https://staging.cms.va.gov/resources/when-will-i-get-my-first-gi-bill-payment](https://staging.cms.va.gov/resources/when-will-i-get-my-first-gi-bill-payment) 
  * FAQ where Q&A is added as entity reference, under Q&A groups: [https://staging.cms.va.gov/node/15640/edit](https://staging.cms.va.gov/node/15640/edit)

## Translation React widgets

**What is:**

Q4 2023: Full site translations are not yet available. Drupal functionality has been scoped and is owned by CMS team for future delivery. 
Meantime: Some site content must be translated. When this is required, typically Sitewide CAIA (Content, Accessibility, IA) determine which pages and provide the translations as separate CMS nodes per translated page (e.g. English, Spanish, Tagalog).  Public Websites then implements a React widget on each of those pages, that acts as an in-page navigation / switcher. 

Public Websites team: 
* Maintains currently translated pages
* Supports new translation widgets for any pages that require it 

**Example translated content:**
* URL: [https://www.va.gov/health-care/covid-19-vaccine/](https://www.va.gov/health-care/covid-19-vaccine/)
* CMS: 
  * En: [https://staging.cms.va.gov/node/11463/edit](https://staging.cms.va.gov/node/11463/edit)
  * Es: [https://staging.cms.va.gov/node/16359/edit](https://staging.cms.va.gov/node/16359/edit)
  * Tl: [https://staging.cms.va.gov/node/16413/edit](https://staging.cms.va.gov/node/16413/edit)
* EN: https://www.va.gov/health-care/how-to-apply/

# VA Benefits Taxonomy
https://prod.cms.va.gov/admin/structure/taxonomy/manage/va_benefits_taxonomy/overview
Single source of truth for VA Benefits meta information, used by the Sitewide Content team through VA.gov benefits. 

Docs: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/structured-content/va-benefits-taxonomy/README.md

Taxonomy launched in 2023, in pilot use by CAIA for managing benefits information with intent to expand its use / association with other Benefits content coming from the Drupal CMS. Not yet incorporated in VA.gov frontend.

# Non-CMS content / products

## Discharge upgrade wizard
https://www.va.gov/discharge-upgrade-instructions

The discharge upgrade wizard was written by the Decision Tools team. That team transitioned responsibility to the Search & Discovery Team, which has since become Public Websites purview as of 2022. 

Q1 2024 will include an [initiative to rebuild the tool using the DS sub-task pattern](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/veteran-military-records/discharge-upgrade-wizard/initiatives/2024-discharge-upgrade-wizard-subtask), and to modernize content.

## Shadow / dark launches of content

### Ownership: CMS team
**Dark launches are owned by the CMS team as of 10/31/2023.**  
Docs will move to a new location, pending outcomes from https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/15932

### Usage
Sometimes content generated by the Sitewide Content team, other teams, or just portions of a page may need to “dark launch” meaning: not be available to all site users in production. We have options for how to manage dark launches: 

### It is **not** currently possible to
* Hide a specific CMS node from robots.txt & the sitemap. Not ticketed, and would/will require custom code.
* Display a CMS-generated page to a % of users for incremental launch.

### It IS currently possible to

#### 1. Use Tugboat to preview CMS + content-build + vets-website changes together.
* In the `/admin/content/deploy` Release Content interface on Tugboat, you can specify a content-build and/or a vets-website branch, to get a full feature preview in Tugboat frontend.

#### 2. Use vets-api “Flipper” feature toggles to show / hide page sections or react widgets (vets-website changes)

- https://api.va.gov/flipper/features – to login: you must have a verified ID.me account using your VA.gov email address (as primary or secondary email) 
- https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/feature-toggles 
- https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/feature-toggles-guide 

Flippers cannot control visibility of an entire page to unauthenticated users or prevent it from being accessed. Once a page exists in production, Flipper can control visibility of the element it's wrapped around. Flipper controls can show/hide:

- boolean style (on/off) for the wrapped element
- visibility to % of logged in users. Used for slow rollouts e.g. to 25%, 50%, 100% of page visitors
- visibility % time, which we believe means page serves, e.g. 25% of times the page is loaded, whatever is behind the flipper will be displayed. 
- Logged-in Actors, specified by email address, who will / won't see the content (can also specify a % of Actors)

A good summary of how to flipper: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/8853#issuecomment-625426153 

Flippers are typically using javascript, and do not require a code deploy to enable / change settings.

#### 3. Write custom vets-website code to control traffic to unauthenticated element / widget
With the release of chatbot, custom code was written to allow % traffic gating for unauthenticated visitors to the chatbot  React widget.
* Add contact chatbot CTA widget[#20280](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/pull/20280), [PR](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/commit/aeedb0e664c7e265ae8b0ffc9533d5d3108635ad)
* Render the content to a % of users: [#21363](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/21363); [PR](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/pull/20378)

#### 4. Publish a CMS page only to Staging (using EntityQueue) in order to stage CMS + content-build + vets-website for viewing off of VA network
Typically, when a CMS page is published, it publishes to production. 
However: as of Sept 2022, a CMS node may be published to staging.va.gov _only_ by using EntityQueue. This is useful to allow previewing a new CMS page that includes a React widget (aka vets-website code), before it reaches production for user acceptance testing (by off-network users) or stakeholder approval. CMS team does not want to get in the habit of having staged nodes that will not publish, so this method should only be used for business cases that warrant it, at Public Websites PO's discretion.

**How to stage:** 
* (Requesting team) cut a [Dark launch request ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/new?assignees=jilladams%2C+wesrowe&labels=Drupal+engineering%2C+Needs+refining%2C+%E2%AD%90%EF%B8%8F+Public+Websites%2C+VA.gov+frontend&template=pw-dark-launch.md&title=CMS%2FReact+content+dark+launch+request%3A+%3Ccontent+info%3E) to Public Websites to request support
  * Specify Node / prod CMS link to the node 
* (Requesting team) When PW has prioritized the work, merge React widget code to main & confirm deploy in vets-website. App code will not appear on prod, **if no live page is calling the app**. 
* (PW) Add the Node ID to the [Staged Content entity subqueue](https://prod.cms.va.gov/admin/structure/entityqueue/staged_content/staged_content?destination=/admin/structure/entityqueue)
* (PW) Request approval from requesting team to publish the node to staging, then publish it.
* (PW/Deployment) 
  * The nightly CMS build must run which pushes prod mirror to the staging site, or PW must request an out of band deployment. 
  * Content-release must then run. Page will be live on Staging after the first content-release after nightly CMS build.

**How to launch**
* (Requesting team) Greenlight to launch
* (PW) Remove the node ID from the [Staged Content entity subqueue](https://prod.cms.va.gov/admin/structure/entityqueue/staged_content/staged_content?destination=/admin/structure/entityqueue)
* (PW/Deployment) 
  * The nightly CMS build must run or PW must request an out of band deployment. 
  * Content-release must then run. Page will be live on Prod after the first content-release after nightly CMS build.

NOTES: 
1. It is _not_ possible to use this mechanism to test updates / additions to an existing live/published CMS page. The dark launch mechanism says: for this node ID, include it in the Staging build, and do _not_ include it in the Production build. So testing an existing node in this way would effectively unpublish it from Production.
2. For reference, the staging CMS database is not implicated in this process / these changes. The front-end of staging.va.gov is populated by a database mirror of Prod, and is rewritten everytime code is merged to prod. The staging CMS, staging.cms.va.gov, has no front-end -- no front-end is updated when the Staging db is modified.

**Entityqueue implementation:**
- Spike: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/10327
- FE: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/10374
- BE: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/10375


#### 5. Use CMS feature flags to show / hide fields or portions of templates in content-build
- CMS docs https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/blob/main/READMES/interfaces.md#featureflags 
- Front-end usage docs: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vspwiki/blob/master/frontend/pages/platform/tools/feature-toggles.md#testing-cms-feature-toggles 

CMS Feature flags can control visibility from the template layer, but cannot control query content / behavior.
CMS feature toggles take effect at the content-build level, and are not dynamically controlled with javascript, so do require a content release to take effect in prod.

For example, if a new feature is launching, that calls new fields / exposes new layout of a template, we may use CMS feature flags to wrap the new markup in order to show / hide the changes for testing or to simplify rollback. 

We try to avoid page-specific templates, so for example, we would not advocate controlling launch of content for a single page using this method. This is more a content type level option.


#### 6. Use content-build environment checks to publish a static page only to staging
This only applies to static pages, not CMS content. In content-build, we can exclude a static page from production builds.

PW team has done this twice: 
1. Published a static page for Harassment Reporting Tool, [#35161 [FE] Build static landing page in Staging environment](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/35161)
2. Published a homepage prototype for UA testing, /homepage-test: [#8340 Iterate VA.gov homepage changes for demo/testing in publicly accessible environment](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/8340); [PR](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/content-build/pull/1081/files#diff-9d481a9d1d5399befb7b3d6424a262b6e38796b248c017c0f6bacddd4bd54814) 

**Gotcha:** this method creates tech debt, and can cause unexpected behavior in future, when we test in Staging and end up with different behavior in Production. E.g. Feature A tests well in staging, but when we reach Prod, behavior is different due to a forgotten environment check in old / untouched code.

## Header / footer injection

**What is:**

Details: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/header-footer/injected-header

The VA.gov modernization project will take years to bring alllllllll VA content into the main site. In the meantime, VA offices / orgs that use TeamSite (old CMS) may want to adopt the new header/ footer. This can be achieved by “injecting” it, using a set of Javascript / stylesheets, and a cookie.


**More information:**
* https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/header-footer/injected-header

## Income limits web application

**What is:**

The income limits web app will be a tool that helps veterans understand if their income will be a factor in benefits eligibility. Discovery / design = Q3 2022 goal.

Veterans are eligible for benefits based on a complex matrix of factors including: income, number of children, location, location of service, known exposure to toxic chemicals, etc. Income limit is one factor. 

**Example content:**
* Current income limits information (that will be handled by the new web app): [https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/apps/explorer/AnnualIncomeLimits/HealthBenefits](https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/apps/explorer/AnnualIncomeLimits/HealthBenefits)

**More info:**

## On-site search (using search.gov)

**What is:**

VA.gov uses search.gov as its engine. Public Websites owns that integration, and display of search results within the site. 

**Example content:**
* URL: [https://www.va.gov/search/?query=test&t=false](https://www.va.gov/search/?query=test&t=false)  
* Example issue: TODO

**Note on API keys**
* API keys for search and search-typeahead are different keys generated by api.data.gov.  At the time this was written, keys are maintained by platform devops, and the keys belong to the universal devops user.  Should the email tied to these keys be lost, new ones will need to be generated

## Non-facility Redirects

**What is:**

Request to change a URL and/or implement a redirect for a URL. Also for vanity URL requests. 

Facilities team can handle redirects for Facility URLs / content. 

**Workflow:**
[Redirects IA Context & Workflow](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/information-architecture/process/redirects.md)
* Another team requests a URL redirect
* Sitewide Content team vets the request – IA will approve the requested URLs (Process: [Platform IA Redirects](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/information-architecture/process/redirects.md))
* Sitewide Content team assigns the issue to Public Websites via va.gov-team issue
* Public Websites moves the issue to va.gov-cms repo, assigns in sprint, completes work, merges
* If server-side redirect: Revproxy build job must deploy the code: http://jenkins.vfs.va.gov/job/deploys/job/revproxy-vagov-prod/ -- this job runs automatically at ~10a ET Mon-Thurs. (Job is owned by the Platform team. ) 
* If client-side redirect: vets-website deploys the code. 
* PW verifies in prod, before closing the ticket

### If you need an **Out of Band deployment** (off cycle deploy):
  * open a #vfs-platform-support request, "Off-out-band deployment." Example: https://dsva.slack.com/archives/CBU0KDSB1/p1664314493443639
  * Open an [OOB Github](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=&labels=frontend%2C+operations%2C+platform-tech-team-support&projects=&template=OOB-Deploy-Request.md&title=OOB+Deploy+Request) request, and link to the Platform support thread.
  * Plan to write a [post-mortem](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/1c1242cafc9f1d614abd933db5c92d13e1a2a19a/Postmortems/README.md) to describe why OOB was required.

## Unauthed React Healthcare widgets

**What is:**

Public Websites manages a React application for a CTA widget that appears on 5 Health care tool landing pages: 
* refill prescriptions
* make appointment
* get VA medical records
* send secure message
* view lab or test results

Calls to action on these widgets point users to the Electronic Healthcare Records (EHR) system used by their primary healthcare facility. Three flavors of EHR: 
* MyHealtheVet - Digital platform of the VistA healthcare provider. CTAs that point to MHV, once a user logs in, will take users out to MHV's platform.
* Oracle Health (formerly Cerner) - New EHR provider as of 2020, used at some VAMC systems/facilities. Systems were migrating to Cerner (at the time) through 2022; migrations on pause as of July 2022. For Veterans who have patient records at an Oracle Health facility, CTAs that point to Oracle Health will also appear and take those users out to Oracle Health's digital platform.
* MyHealtheVet on VA.gov - An in-house digital platform built by the VA. CTAs that point to MHV on VA.gov will take users to a VA.gov dashboard, where both MHV and Oracle Health data is pulled in via APIs.

As Health care tool teams are updating landing pages or CTA actions to point to MyHealtheVet on VA.gov, Public Websites may be called up on as code reviewers to review changes and ensure that the unauthed experience for these 5 widgets behaves as expected. 

**Other unauthed react widgets**
* BTSSS - Epic where it was created: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/9157
* Travel Pay -

## Downtime messaging

When sites or apps go down, there are 2 ways to handle downtime: 
1. Using formal downtime notifications that can be set up in PagerDuty, if your app has an external API dependency.
2. Using a full-width banner (CMS content type) that can publish to specific pages in VA.gov.

When using a full-width banner, Public Websites maintains the content type itself. If you are simply publishing a new banner for a downtime, activity should be managed with Sitewide Content, Accessibility, and IA who govern content for individual banners.

  * React component (vets-website): `src/applications/edu-benefits/component/createEducationApplicationStatus.jsx`
* https://www.va.gov/education/how-to-apply

## React widgets use within CMS

Product teams may want to integrate a vets-website React widget into CMS pages. When that's required, product teams work with CAIA regarding content, and integration into content pages. 
Public Websites helps support the mechanism that allows React widget integration into the CMS pages. (This should probably move to the CMS team someday.)

Sitewide content team documentation: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/sitewide-content/processes/dynamic-content-process.md
