## Overview
Currently, search tools such as the main Search page, Find a Form, Resources & Support and Facility Locator all have different UI styling. Our intent is to create UI consistency using the current style guide for all of the listed search tools.

## Problem Statement
Having an inconsistent UI style for each of the search tools creates confusion for veterans. 
In order to improve the UI style for veteratns we need to apply a clear and consistent styling across all tools.

 
## Desired User Outcomes

- a consistent UI is a better experience for Veterans

## Undesired User Outcomes

- createing a consistent UI across all search tools helps decrease confusion for Veterans


## Desired Business Outcomes

- Veterans use the search tools more


## Undesired Business Outcomes
