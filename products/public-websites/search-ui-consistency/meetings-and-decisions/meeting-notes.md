## 2021-04-15 Internal Design Review

#### Attendees
- John Hashimoto, PO
- Denise Coveyduc, PM for Search & Discovery Team
- Marci McGuire, PM for Decision Tools Team
- Brian Lloyd, PM for Public Websites Team
- Cassandra Allen, Designer for PW/DT
- Megan Gayle, Designer for S&D Team

#### Notes
- Megan & Cassandra will show their spreadsheet in the design intent review to set stage for why this is needed
- Megan doesn't have all of the states in her comps yet
- Megan & Cassandra will point out the differences in the elements that they observed
- Megan will share her comps first since it's global search
    - They are not showing the right rail because it's being discontinued
    - The green link text is consistent across Search.gov and cannot be modified.
- Cassandra will share next
    - Josh Kim confirmed that the underline should be added to any title hearder links.
    - Cassandra will add the sorting element and number of results back before they attach the link
    - I'll be curious of Josh's feedback on the hover.
    - Cristabell provided the icons.
    - Cassandra purposely picked the longest link 
    - Search term is one of the smallest thing on the page. Any latitude to make the title link smaller so it's not so overwhelming?
    - Cassandra will change the label to "Go to Online Tool"
    - Point out that the online tool button shifts on hover
- There is opportunity for these changes to be applied to Yellow Ribbon and other tools as teams have capacity/prioritize
   - Button on YR is green, doesn't have a search icon
- Form intro inconsistency -  need feedback from Design review - should those be re-displayed when the results are shown?
- Also point out lack of consistency in collapsing elements into a menu on mobile
- Intro text should still be displayed on Resources & Support when you initially land on the page
- R&S Beta banner will display until it hits a certain level of content (75-80% search success rate)

#### Action Items
- Add the sorting element to Find a VA Form
- Add number of results to Find a VA Form
- Change the online tool button label textto "Go to Online Tool"
- Add intro text to Resources & Support when you initially land on the page
- Designs will be uploaded to inVision and attached as artifacts to the Design Intent Review ticket. https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/22885

## 2021-04-09

#### Topic
- Design intent review
- Overview of project scope
- Current status of each design
- Date for design intent review
- Documents needed

#### Notes
- Brief scope overview
- Cassandra's update
    - Headers do need to be updated to have a link underneath per Josh Kim's feedback
    - There will be a separate ticket for R&S mobile per John to make it match the other mobile

- Megan's update
    - Adding an underline as well
    - Has also noticed there's a width difference

- Leyda's update
    - They did an audit for link styles and buttons
    - They did a review of the Facility Locator - font style differences; pretty minor
    - They probably align the least we well for some of the layout stuff.  Don't use the same form library

- Design Intent Review Timing
    - I have not put the request in yet; they ask for a date and time. 
    - Leyda needs probably another week
    - Early the week after next.

- Michelle - questions, concerns?
    - Are VAMC pages in scope?  
    - Leyda identified all the buttons that needed to be changed
    - Link styles - gets a little muddy. It's a decision we need to make. Do they want to update all the VAMC pages?
    - Marci asked if it would it be reasonable to just do a representative page for VAMC with the various pieces that could potentially appear.
    - Facility locator input field is currently bold.  Style guide is to unbold.

#### Decisions
- Implementation of the UI changes will be done as each team prioritizes and has bandwidth to roll them into their products. 

#### Action Items
- Complete Product Outline (Marci)
- Schedule design intent review (Marci)
- Gather design artifacts (Marci, Cassandra, Megan, Leyda)
