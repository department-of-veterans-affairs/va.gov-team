# Potential Research for Unauth
Cindy Merrill, Senior Researcher, Mar 2021
## Research Questions
### Overall
* Why do Veterans come to VA.gov? With what goals/tasks in mind?
* How do Veterans currently try to find what they’re looking for on VA.gov?
What have they looked for recently and how? 
Search and/or browse?
Where do they start typically? Google? Facebook?
Do they find what they need? If not, what were they looking for? 
What are the biggest pain points?
What are the most-asked questions at the VA call center? 
Search
Which of the multiple search boxes on VA.gov do Veterans use? (global site search in header, Resources and Support, Find a Form, Find a Location, Find Yellow Ribbon school)
Are Veterans currently aware of any of the tools besides Global search? (all the others are pretty new and haven’t really been advertised)
Are they confused about which search method to use, or do they only use one? If only one, which one?
What do analytics tell us? Are all of these search methods being used?
My hypothesis: Veterans just want to find what they’re looking for, and don’t want to choose from multiple ways to search unless it helps them get better results.
Get feedback on usability of search--findability, usage

Next Steps
Check analytics data to compare usage across unauth products 
Talk to people to learn what the biggest pain points are
Call centers (Chante Sweet)--ask re question topics/themes
Meg Peters (IA lead)
Danielle and Beth (content leads)
Gather the most important unauth user tasks from journey map & other sources
Speak to Meg Peters and Shawna about top task thoughts (maybe a meeting w/ all three of us)
Determine what unauth research would be the most impactful in the near term
Baseline research across new products that haven’t been tested
Research on products that support the most important user tasks
