# Potential Research for Unauth
Cindy Merrill, Senior Researcher, Mar 2021
## Research Questions
### Overall
* Why do Veterans come to VA.gov? With what goals/tasks in mind?
* How do Veterans currently try to find what they’re looking for on VA.gov?
  * What have they looked for recently and how? 
    * Search and/or browse?
    * Where do they start typically? Google? Facebook?
  * Do they find what they need? If not, what were they looking for? 
* What are the biggest pain points?
* What are the most-asked questions at the VA call center? 
### Search
- Which of the multiple search boxes on VA.gov do Veterans use? (global site search in header, Resources and Support, Find a Form, Find a Location, Find Yellow Ribbon school)
  - What Veterans think about searching on VA.gov?
  - Are Veterans aware of any of the search tools besides Global search? (all the others are pretty new and haven’t really been advertised)
  - What feedback do Veterans have on the search tools? Too many? Confused about which to use, or do they only use one? If only one, which one?
  - What do analytics tell us? Are all of these search methods being used?
  - *My hypothesis: Veterans just want to find what they’re looking for, and don’t want to choose from multiple ways to search unless it helps them get better results.*
- Get feedback on usability of search--findability, usage
- Get feedback on usability of search results
### Resources & Support
- Do Veterans use this? Check analytics data
- Get feedback on usability--findability, usage, mobile experience
- What do Veterans think about a "subscription or RSS feed" model where they could subscribe to content types and get notification when new content is added? 
### Benefit Hubs 
(is this the Benefits index below the 4 quadrants on va.gov?)
- Do Veterans use this? Check analytics data
- How do Veterans use this? (get info and leave? stay and browse?)
- Get feedback on usability--findability, usage
### Find a Form
- Do Veterans use this? Check analytics data
- Get feedback on usability--findability, usage
### Find Yellow Ribbon school
- Do Veterans use this? Check analytics data
- Get feedback on usability--findability, usage
- Any confusion with the GI Bill Comparison Tool? Do Veterans know which to use when?
## Next Steps
- Check analytics data to compare usage across unauth products 
- Talk to people to learn what the biggest pain points are
  - Call centers (Chante Sweet)--ask re question topics/themes
  - Meg Peters (IA lead)
  - Danielle and Beth (content leads)
- Gather the most important unauth user tasks from journey map & other sources
  - Talk to Meg Peters and Shawna together about top task thoughts
- Determine what unauth research would be the most impactful in the near term
  - Baseline research across new products that haven’t been tested
  - Research on products that support the most important user tasks
