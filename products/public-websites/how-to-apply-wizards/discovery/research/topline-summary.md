[Session Notes](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/how-to-apply-wizards/discovery/research/wizard-migration-study-notes.xlsx)

This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.

The goal of this document is:

 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings

 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data

Research Questions & Answers
----------------------------

**Are people still able to understand the wizard outcome in the new, simplified, icon-free design?**

Yes. No one had trouble understanding the wizard outcomes.  

**How easily do people understand where they're being routed to?**

-   Easily. 

-   One participant commented that they didn't remember the form number from the first wizard outcome when they saw the second, but it didn't hinder their experience in the session.

**Are people able to find the skip link?**

-   3 of 5 participants noticed the skip link.  

-   They read the page top-to-bottom, which may be a result of the think aloud methodology.  If we don't change the design pattern, we should keep an eye on this in future studies on a live product.

**When would people want to use the skip link?**

-   When they have a saved, in progress application

-   When they're told by a school counselor where to go.

> Probably because I would have talked to an education benefits counselor and verified that I actually needed that VA form... I would go ahead and hit that [link].

**How easily do people understand how to start over?**

-   I think the tasks were worded/flowed awkwardly to properly evaluate this.  

-   2 people didn't realize you'd have to fill out a similar form to update the school, and expected to find it in their profile/account information

-   3 participants noticed the link and 2 did not. 

**In the education flow, do people get confused by being started on the 1990 form page from the How to apply page?**

-   No

**How about when they're routed to a different form from the 1990?**

-   2 participants said it felt like they were in the same place. Upon closer inspection, they realized they were on a different form.

-   P4 wanted to see more confirmation in the subway map that they went to page about updating their school.

> Down in here [step list], I don't see anything that confirms I'm where I need to be.

-   P5 (and possibly someone else - need to confirm) was confused about why you would be "applying" to update your school if you had already applied for and been approved for education benefits.

**Can users get back to the wizard once they've navigated away from a form page?**

-   We didn't force this interaction but when it happened naturally, people said they'd use their back button. 

-   P4 and P5 stated they'd be frustrated to have to start over again on the wizard if their back button took them there.

> I would kind of be upset, because that's not where I want to be. I'd have to do everything all over again to get back to where I was.

**When do users want to go back to the wizard?**

-   One participant didn't really understand the question.

-   Not sure we got good data about this.

-   Skipped this question on last participant because we were running out of time.

**Do people understand the wizard questions? Are any of the questions confusing or unclear?**

-   All participants  were unsure how to respond to  by the national call to service question and wanted to click the  "meet eligibility criteria" link. They all expected it to open in a new tab  or pop-up so they could save their place and return to the wizard where they left off.

-   3 people were confused about VETTECH

**Are people confident they are applying for the right benefit after they take the wizard?**

-   For the 1990, everyone was sure they went to the right place

-   For the 1995

-   P4 wanted to see more confirmation in the subway map that they went to page about updating their school. Did anyone else have this experience?

-   P5 was uncertain about why they would "apply" if they were just changing their school.

Hypotheses & Answers
--------------------

**People will understand the wizard outcomes, and where they're being routed to.**

-   Yes, people understood. 

-   One participant commented they couldn't remember the first form number the wizard sent them to.

**The skip and start over links will be missed by some people, but those who are interested in those actions will easily be able to find them.**

-   3 of 5 people saw the skip link when reading carefully. This suggests that people are actively looking for a way to skip would be able to find this.

**People will be able to complete the wizard flows on desktop and mobile with the same level of ease.**

-   Unable to test mobile for this study

**People will think the intro/step-list page is overwhelming.**

-   False. No participants thought it was overwhelming

-   One participant skipped the steps and would just sign in and start filling out the application.

**People will feel more confident about completing the online benefit application because the wizard indicates they may be eligible.**

-   Not necessarily. 

-   We didn't explicitly ask this and no one talked about a lack of confidence in filling out online forms.

-   P5 was uncertain about why they would "apply" if they were just changing their school.

**People will find value in the wizard.**

-   True.  People liked this option in combination with the long format content eligibility/how to apply information. Both are useful for different scenarios.

-   One participant said they felt this approach was better for them on certain days, when they didn't want to read a bunch of information.

Other findings
--------------

**People expect links in the wizard and step list to open in a new tab, so they can return to where they were and don't need to start over. **

- When navigating away from the intro page, participants said they'd use their back button to get back to the intro page. 
- They expected to go back to where they were, not a restart of the wizard. 

> That would be frustrating, because I'm starting over.

> If it resets the page forcing me to re-select things becomes tedious after a while
