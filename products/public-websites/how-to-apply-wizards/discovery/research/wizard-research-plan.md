# Research Plan for Wizard Migration, VSA, October 2020

## Goals	

1. What product & team are you doing this research for?	

   This research is to test proposed changes to the wizard flow, which impacts both BAM teams, BAH team, and Public Websites.

2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 	

   We've been using the wizard pattern on Drupal content pages that guide users to forms to try to verify eligibility before they apply for a benefit.  However, users who go directly to form pages via a direct URL, or a link on VA.gov, bypass the wizard and don't get this eligibility check.  Some wizards, such as the 526, collect data that is then passed into the user's application. 

   We're moving the wizards from Drupal content pages to the form intro pages to minimize the chance of people bypassing the wizard.

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 

   - Are people still able to understand the wizard outcome in the new, simplified, icon-free design?
   - How easily do people understand where they're being routed to?
   - When would people want to use the skip link?
   - Are people able to find the skip link?
   - How easily do people understand how to start over?
   - How do people understand various entry points and ways of getting to the form?
   - In the education flow, do people get confused by being started on the 1990 form page from the How to apply page? How about when they're routed to a different from from the 1990?
   - Can users get back to the wizard once they've navigated away from a form page?
   - When do users want to go back to the wizard?
   - There may be other small, content PW website questions to tack on to this research (Peggy will check with Danielle / Peggy)
   - Do people understand the wizard questions?
   - Are people confident they are applying for the right benefit after they take the wizard?

4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 	

   - People will understand the wizard outcomes, and where they're being routed to.
   - The skip and start over links will be missed by some people, but those who are interested on those actions will easily be able to find it.
   - People will be able to complete the wizard flows on desktop and mobile with the same level of ease.
   - People will think the intro/step-list page is overwhelming.
   - People will feel more confident about completing the online benefit application because the wizard indicates they may be eligible.

## Method	

1. What method of research are you planning? 	

   Remote, moderated usability testing on an interactive, UXPin prototype.

2. Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 	

   Allowing users to interact w/ the wizards and flows will help us see first hand any usability issues they encounter with our proposed changes.

3. Where are you planning to do your research? 

   Online with Zoom

4. What will you be testing? *(Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)* 	

   UX Pin prototype

5. If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)	

   Zoom

## Participants and Recruitment	

1. Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?	  

   - We'd like to speak to 6-8 Veterans who have experience with education benefits, or are planning on applying for education benefits in the next 3 months.  

   - We'd like for 3-4 participants to complete the session on a smart phone, and 3-4 participants to complete the session on a desktop device.

   - Please recruit 12-16 Veterans to account for no-shows; we'll cancel remaining participants once we hit our quota.

   **Primary criteria / Must have**

   - Veterans who have applied for education benefits in the last 12 months, or are planning on applying for education benefits within the next 3 months. 
   - 50% participants must be able to participate on a desktop/laptop
   - 50% participants must be able to participant on a smart phone (iPhone, Galaxy, etc)

   - For this session, we are unable to include:
     -  Those who use assistive technology, such as screen readers (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and ChromeVox).
     -  People with significant vision loss.
     -  People who use magnification tools.

   **Secondary criteria / Would like to have** 

   - 50% women, 50% men
   - 50% people who identify as an ethnicity/race other Caucasian
   - At least 1 participant 35 or under and 1 participant over 55
   - At least one person with a disability rating of 70% or greater
   - At least two participants that have identified cognitive impairments and/or functional disabilities. Examples of diagnoses that may align with this would be Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), autism, and vertigo. Other conditions may be aphasia, dyslexia, dyscalculia, distractibility, memory loss, reading difficulties, low tolerance for cognitive overload, and intellectual/adaptive functioning challenges such as learning and problem-solving.

2. What is your recruitment strategy? 	
   We'd like to have Perigean recruit our participants for this study.
