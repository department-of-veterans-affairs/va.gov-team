When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro

Intro - 3 minutes
-----------------

Thanks for joining us today! My name is (Christian/Liz) and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about finding the right form when you want to apply for education or disability benefits on VA.gov.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

-   This entire session should take about 30 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

-   In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

-   You'll be interacting with a prototype. This is a prototype that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a prototype, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

-   If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

-   Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

-   If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

Start recording.

-   I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes
----------------------------------------

Before we look at the website, I'd like to understand if you have any experience with forms on VA.gov

-   Have you ever applied for benefits through a form on VA.gov before?
-   What was that experience like?
-   Do you remember going to any pages about eligibility before you applied? What did you think about those pages?

As we go through the session, it'll be a great if you can think out loud and talk about what you're seeing. I've found it can be helpful if we go through a warm up page first.  

*Ask participant to share screen, and guide them to a benefit hub page on VA.gov relevant to the experience they described above - e.g. [Disability eligibility page](https://www.va.gov/disability/eligibility/), https://www.va.gov/disability/how-to-file-claim/, [education how to apply](https://www.va.gov/education/how-to-apply/), [education eligibility](https://www.va.gov/education/eligibility/)*

- Thank you. Now, take a look at this page, and talk me through what you see, and what you can do on this page.
- Is there anything confusing or unclear about this page?

*Offer feedback to participant on how they're doing.  Suggest they talk more if they're too quiet, or point out anything that is especially helpful that they've done.*

First Task: Find form to apply for new benefits - 8 minutes
-----------------------------------------------------------

-   Great! Thank you for doing that.  Now, I'm going to send you a link to the prototype in the chat. The chat box can be tricky to find in Zoom when you're already sharing your screen - look for the 3 dots in the bar that tells you you are sharing content.
-   It'll be really helpful for you to think out loud as much as possible as we go through this.
-   INSERT LINK TO MOBILE AND DESKTOP PROTOTYPES
-   Send user link to prototype, starting on How to Apply education page
-   Imagine you wanted to go to use your education benefits for the first time, and you made your way to this page.  
-   Show me what you'd do from here to start that process, and please remember to think aloud.
    **If needed:**
    -   Guide participant to how to apply button

    -   Guide participant to complete wizard to trigger 1990 outcome

***Participant should be on the 1990 form intro (subway map) page***

-   How did that experience line up with what you expected?

-   Do you feel like those questions took you to the right place?

-   Is anything here unclear? 

-   Is anything here helpful?

### Things to watch for:

-   How easily does the participant find the how to apply button, and go to the wizard?

-   Does the participant notice they were sent to a form start page (1990) from the How to Apply page?

-   Did the participant notice the skip link?

-   How easily does the participant complete the wizard?

-   Does the sign-in alert present any usability challenges?

Second Task: Start Over - 2 minutes
-----------------------------------

***Participant should be on the 1990 intro / subway map page:***

- Now imagine this scenario: you already have education benefits, you've decided to move to a new school and need to update your school info with the VA. Show me how you would do that from here.

  **If needed:**

  -   Guide participant back to the how to apply page to start the wizard again.

### Things to watch for:

-   Does the participant know they need to fill out a form to update education benefits?

-   Does the participant notice the text link to start over?

-   Does the participant understand that the wizard has routed them somewhere?

Third Task: Find form to update benefits (change school) - 5 minutes
--------------------------------------------------------------------

***Participant should be on how to apply page***

- Now, please answer the questions as if you are going to update the school info associated with your education benefits.

  **If needed:**

  -   Guide participant through wizard to 1995.

***Participant should be on the 1995 form intro (subway map) page***

-   How did that experience line up with what you expected?

-   Do you feel like those questions took you to the right place?

-   Is anything here unclear? 

-   Is anything here helpful?

### Things to watch for:

-   Does the participant understand they've been routed to a new form page than where they started? 

-   Are they confused about where they've landed?

-   Did the participant notice the skip link?

Fourth Task: Review STEM scholarship eligibility info - 3 minutes
-----------------------------------------------------------------

***Participant should be on the 1995 page***

I'm going to have you go through one more set of questions.  Are you familiar with the Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship? 

*If not, okay to offer context: it allows some eligible Veterans and dependents in high-demand fields to extend their Post-9/11 GI Bill or Fry Scholarship benefits.*

- Imagine you wanted to use STEM scholarship to extend your benefits.  Show me how you'd go through that.

  **If needed:** 

  -   Guide participant back to wizard, and to select 3rd option in first question:
      *"Applying to extend my Post-9/11 or Fry Scholarship benefits using the Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship"*

*After reading eligibility info, it's fine for them to select yes or no.*

-   What do you think about the information you see here? 

-   Is anything here unclear? 

-   What is most helpful on this page?

### Things to watch for:

-   Did the participant get confused during this step?

-   Did the participant read the eligibility information?

Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes
-------------------------------

- If participant didn't notice or address this yet:
  - Did you ever notice a way to skip the wizard?

  - Can you think of a time when you wouldn't want to take the wizard?

  - Did you ever notice a way to start over?

  - Can you think of a time when you'd want to start over after getting to the intro page with the list of things you need to prepare for filling out the form?
- Thinking back to the warm-up page we looked at in this session about [eligibility/applying] - what do you think about that information compared going through a series of questions that tells you where to go?
- Any questions for me?

Thank-You and Closing - 1 minute
--------------------------------

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.
