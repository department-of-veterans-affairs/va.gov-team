## Research Goals 

This research was to test proposed changes to the wizard flow, which impacts both BAM teams, BAH team, and Public Websites.


## Research Methodology 

This study was a remote, moderated usability test planned by Liz Lantz and Christian Valla using an interactive Invision prototype. Zoom was used to facilitate a set of 4 tasks to test the changes to the wizard flow and participants were encouraged to talk aloud.

Liz Lantz acted as the primary facilitator and interviewer for all sessions. Notetakers included Tressa Furner, Josh Kim, and Megan Gayle. To mitigate confirmation bias, Megan Gayle and Josh Kim led this synthesis effort as they were uninvolved in the design of the wizard.


## Who we talked to

- Only 5 users could be tested in the study compared to the anticipated 6-8 due to an unforeseen facilitator withdrawal from the study. 
- 7 out of the 11 requested participant criteria were met
- There were not enough participants to provide confident recommendations. For more on sampling risks and potential solutions, [view the sample data and analysis document.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/how-to-apply-wizards/discovery/research/sample-data-analysis.md)


## Risks


### Technology Coverage
- Mobile was not tested which may have unveiled significant variance in behavior due to the sign-in alert covering the page to the fold e.g. participants may have not scrolled further down the page. Small touch targets within the wizard may have also posed challenges (one user struggled to select the right radio button on tablet).
- Screen reader and keyboard use was not tested which may have unveiled significant variance in navigational behavior as elements can be shown and hidden unexpectedly. 
- Zooming was not tested
- A tablet user existed, but the test was not designed for tablet viewports
- Low bandwidth was not tested


### Participants
- Due to variance in behavior between the 5 recruited participants, no recommendations can be made with confidence and should be treated as educated guesses in need of further validation.
- Although disability ratings were provided, categories of disabilities were not. Therefore findings related to any category of disability cannot be made confidently.

## Research Questions

- Are people still able to understand the wizard outcome in the new, simplified, icon-free design?

- How easily do people understand where they're being routed to?

- Are people able to find the skip link?

- When would people want to use the skip link?

- How easily do people understand how to start over?

- In the education flow, do people get confused by being started on the 1990 form page from the How to apply page?

- How about when they're routed to a different form from the 1990?

- Can users get back to the wizard once they've navigated away from a form page?

- When do users want to go back to the wizard?

- Do people understand the wizard questions?

- Are any of the questions confusing or unclear?

- Are people confident they are applying for the right benefit after they take the wizard?


## Key Findings
1. 2/5 participants did not notice the skip link and 4/5 participants did not notice the link to start over. Veterans were more interested in links that could provide them information relevant to them. 
2. All participants understood when the wizard routed them elsewhere for the first time, but 2/5 became confused when routed to a different form the second time.
3. Participants consistently wanted more information before taking any actions. Majority of the barriers to task completion for the veterans were a result of mismatched content or not having enough information to make a choice.
4. All participants read eligibility information, but this may have been positively influenced by the nature of the moderated read out loud activity.


## Details of Findings

### 2/5 participants did not notice the skip link and 4/5 participants did not notice the link to start over. Veterans were usually only interested in links that were relevant to them.

> "Uh.. I think there is a way... but I didn't do that. Is this the form I need... oh right here {Apply for VA education benefits with VA form 22-1990}. Well if you wanted to find this form number you could probably just put it in google to start the form." 

> "I guess I didn't really look um... hmm... I guess I did not notice anything to skip. I'd like to have a continue button if I've already started. Something like "continue" or having a link to reference to continue."

> "It's asking me if VA form 22-1990 is the right education form for me..." Hovering over the link: "I would click the 22-1990." "If I already knew this was the correct form, I wouldn't have gone through and read anything else."

> "{L: On the other page you said you'd never notice the go back link} Uh I think it's the font. The font is ... everything that's large or draws my attention that's what I need to pay attention to. So I would have to go back to the top if the go back [link] was at the top. I would go straight back to the larger fonts, the number, and then I'd go back up to the top and then I'd scroll down and eventually see it but..."

The variation in responses implies more testing will be needed. Behavior may depend on the following:

- Moderated vs. unmoderated study: would users still notice the skip/start over link if they weren't reading out their thoughts deliberately?
- Participant sampling: if we conducted an A/B test with participants with a use for the skip link/start over link vs. participants without a use for the skip/start over link change the findings?
- Visual hierarchy: if we were to increase the prominence of the links slightly, would more users who need it access it? Conversely, would this cause the negative effect of users who don't need it clicking it?
- Content: is this a matter of semantics? Would wording these links differently change behavior?


### All participants understood when the wizard routed them elsewhere for the first time, but 2/5 became confused when routed to a different form the second time.

> "That is exactly where I thought it would lead me to." {1990 form}

> "Down in here {subway map} I don't see {the header} that lets me know or confirms that I'm where I want to be. So when I scroll all the way up I see change... but where I am {in the subway map} I can't see this is the right place." {1995 form}

> "It doesn't seem like updating because it seems like I'm applying to a new school."

The variation in responses implies more testing will be needed. Confusion may have stemmed from the nature of the content of the 1995 form as opposed to the wizard itself. Content changes that may help include:

- Revisiting language in the subway map so that it re-enforces the form's purpose (e.g. instead of "apply", say "change" to match the h1 on the 1995 form). 
- Double checking links in the subway map (e.g. it may be confusing that a link on "career counselors" goes to a page in the disability hub).

This may only be a temporary solution until a more intuitive one is designed (e.g. moving updating education benefits into the user's account page).


### Participants consistently wanted more information before taking any actions. Majority of the barriers to task completion for the veterans were a result of mismatched content or not having enough information to make a choice.

> "I would expect there to be a link for me to have a chat which would be ideal or there would be additional information that would include what I need if I want to transfer schools."

> "Sometimes I just miss information. I don't see a place where I can change my program or anything." {LZ: what would you do next?} Hmm... call! {laughing} That's what I do. There's a number "Need help?" but I have a separate number in my house that I use that directs straight to the education office."

> "GI comparison tool... Would that show the different options? That's what I'm thinking if you click on this it could let you search for the school or what additional benefits they might have. I'm assuming if they have a veteran office there they would show an application."

We hypothesize veterans may be losing track of their tasks or becoming confused by the volume of 'learn more' links on any given page. We observed several participants falling through rabbit holes of content which distracted them away from the facilitated tasks. We also observed participants often attempting to click on 'learn more' links within the wizard itself which would lead to larger pages of content.

An unmoderated study may help us better determine if this is a significant usability issue that should be addressed. In the interim, **we recommend conducting another content review to see where we can make things more clear for veterans.**

Alternative solutions may be uncovered through tests with:

- [GOV.uk's one thing per page](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/form-structure#start-with-one-thing-per-page) to keep low-confidence users on track to task completion. 
- Reducing the amount of (or removing) 'learn more' links within the wizard itself.


### All participants read eligibility information, but this may have been positively influenced by the nature of the moderated read out loud activity.
Since no clear usability issues were observed, we believe this pattern will work well on desktop. However, it is important to note that this recommendation cannot be made with confidence until an unmoderated study is conducted.


## Additional Insights


### When asked, 2/3 participants expected more information within the wizard to open up in a new tab as they were hesitant about losing the selections they filled into the wizard upon leaving and returning to it.

> "{here or this page?} I think it would open up another page to see what I'm referencing. A lot of times after you hit the back button it resets all your submissions. If it resets the page forcing me to re-select things becomes tedious after a while... {Okay got it. I can understand the frustration of an experience like that}."

> "{one more thing, for the meet eligibility requirements link, if you were to click on that link, what would you expect? would you expect for that to open in a new tab/window/link?} I would expect it to be a whole new tab that would explain it and then I could go back and look and answer that question."

> "{What would you expect?} I would uh think it would take me somewhere else and tell me if I meet the eligibility requirements. {where would it take you?} it would take me probably on the same tab."

> "I'm looking for a form or something that will take me to that particular page because I wouldn't think I would need to fill out another application because I'm already in the program. I wouldn't want to answer questions again because I'm already in the program."

> Upon being prompted by the facilitator to return to the wizard page, the participant expressed frustration thinking she was starting over again before realizing there is an option to update her program within it.

Due to the variance in participant expectations and known risks related to opening content in a new tab, we cannot recommend opening more information in a new tab until further unmoderated testing is conducted. [WCAG 2.0 technique G200 states this is permissible](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G200.html), but cautions that users with disabilities in particular may become disorientated. 

The Cooper Group and [Nielsen Norman Group also warns off taking control away from the user](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/the-top-ten-web-design-mistakes-of-1999/) as a user who <em>does not</em> expect a new tab to open will not have control over whether or not it occurs vs. a user who can still use right click -> open in new tab.

Without further testing we cannot make any strong recommendations. A future test may involve:
- A/B testing opening up in a new tab vs. not opening up in a new tab
- A/B testing saving the user's choices in the wizard vs. not saving their choices

Potential solutions may include:
- Using one thing per page to split apart the wizard's questions into individual pages. This would allow for more information and hint text to be naturally included and reduce cognitive load to the user. However, there may be technical constraints due to the form system.
- Removing links from within the wizard itself in favor of summarized plain language descriptions through progressive disclosure similar to the format used for STEM eligibility. In theory, while users who are still confused could contact their education counselor (as observed).


### 1 participant expressed panic upon viewing the sign-in alert on mobile which distracted her from understanding the purpose of the page.

> "{What stands out?} That I need to sign in. Save work is always of interest. Um... I would start trying to rack my brain on a password because... when I see this I would pause because I'd be thinking of what's my password? Do I remember the password? Do I need my password? I would panic a bit."

> "Um... I see it's different because it has requirements but it still feels like I'm starting over... and I'm signing in again... I know initially I clicked that I'm updating but it does not... {reads header}. Down in the {subway map} I don't see {the header} that lets me know or confirms that I'm where I want to be. So when I scroll all the way up I see change... but where I am {in the subway map} I can't see if this is the right place."

We recommend conducting mobile testing to determine if this is a usability issue is compounded on smaller screen sizes where the sign-in alert has more prominence on the page and more scrolling is necessary to parse through content. We hypothesize there is a possibility users may become confused, miss important content information, abandon the flow, or become anxious.


### Participants weren't aware updating education benefits would be done through a form. Only 1/5 participants was able to complete this task without clear guidance from the facilitator.

> "I'm looking for something that says account information that would have my name and a contact us link to ask someone how to update my information. Or if there's a "update your account information" where you could update your home address. {L: What if I told you you'd have to do a form} Like an online form or a paper form? {L: An online form} A web form or a PDF? {L: A web form} Oh yea i'd prefer that since it would be easier. I could click it, make the updates, and save. {L: knowing it's a web form does that change how you'd look for it} No, I'd assume it would be under my account information."

It is not clearly intuitive for veterans to update education benefits through a form. This is a semantics mismatch due to the existing process. 
Although not directly related to the research questions of the study, this is a usability issue that should be investigated more.


### 4/5 participants got help from an education counselor. Education counselors may play a significant role in navigating veterans through the education flow.

> "Most of the stuff was directly through the school. [The VA representative at my school] sent me all the documents and digital forms to sign and they took care of everything else."

> "I have a bunch of scrambled knowledge from years ago, so I put the education counselor to the test to make sure I was doing things correctly..."

> "I used the counselor at the school to help me figure out if they had what they needed."

In future studies we may want to investigate this behavior more including: 

- How can we make it easier for veterans to go through this process w/out having to call someone for help? 
- Where else do veterans reach out for help?
- Consider interviewing school/education counselors for a SME's perspective and heuristic evaluation on the wizard.


### It is unclear from this study whether or not veterans will prefer a block of content type of page vs. the wizard. When asked, 2/5 participants said they would prefer a hybrid approach- but this should not be taken with confidence as users are bad at imagining what they want.

> "I thought the content block was simpler. I like that. You don't need to read as much. Some government websites you have to dig down for more. {to clarify which one..} yea the block one was easier instead of reading through a lot of information {wizard}."

> "I prefer concise {wizard}. Reading through all those paragraphs and stuff I might not be able to focus. And I'm more of a get to the point kinda person. That's why I prefer the counselor who can just tell me what to do. It's a lot more to the point. If I wrote down the step and if it's still confusing than I'd go to the lengthy page and go from there."

> "I think a hybrid approach is better. I do like the bullet format. Most people in the military read bullet format. Bam bam bam that's what I need to know with additional links and additional options. Having these bullets and a guided flow to narrow down... maybe a hybrid approach."

> "I like the option to have a lengthy and have a more concise [option] for everyone's personality. Everybody's different. Sometimes you'll have people like me. Sometimes I'll want to get to the point but sometimes I'll also want more information. As I said it just depends on how my headspace is on that day."

Unmoderated A/B testing will be needed to make a confident recommendation on what is better for veterans.


## Recommendations
- Participants wanted to learn more about what benefits they qualified for by clicking links which would lead them away from the wizard. 
  - Consider adding a shortened eligibility checklist on the page. 
  - Conduct testing or additional research to determine alternative ways to help users gather more information without losing their place in the wizard.
- Conduct content review for the following: 
  - Revisiting language in the subway map so that it re-enforces the form's purpose (e.g. instead of "apply", say "change" to match the h1 on the 1995 form.) 
  - Double checking links in the subway map (e.g. it may be confusing that a link on "career counselors" goes to a page in the disability hub.)
- Participants consistently wanted more information before taking any actions, they were not familiar with certain programs and wanted to know if they qualified for them. 
  - Consider breaking up the wizard questions to [one thing per page](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2015/07/03/one-thing-per-page/) to reduce cognitive load and better address users with low confidence.
  - > "If I'm eligible for it I wanna apply for it."
- The link to start over on the step list page can be removed as users intuitively made use of the browser's back button.
  - > {L: ok so you had clicked here... I'm interested in, say you were interested in applying... can you talk me through how you would get back to where you were?} I would go to these arrows in the top left [browser back button] that's how I would do things. And I've learned through the times working through gov websites- if you x out at the top sometimes you can never get back to where you want to be easily.
- Adjusting the visual hierarchy of the skip link may help users. An unmoderated user test exploring this with users who have a reason to use the link would help our team provide more confident recommendations.

## Next Steps
### Interview school counselors
4/5 participants spoke to a school counselor. Consider interviewing school counselors to better understand veterans’ pain points. What are common frustrations and frequently asked questions? This will help inform us as to why veterans may feel uncomfortable and what changes can be made to make veterans feel comfortable completing forms without external help. 
Besides school counselors, where else they are going to research this, are they going to an external site? Asking friends?

### Test on mobile and assistive technologies

- A significant portion, 39.59% of VA.gov of users, are on mobile. 
- 25% of veterans have a disability.

Testing will need to be conducted with mobile and assistive technologies (keyboard, screen readers) as we hypothesize there will be significant usability issues unique to each of them. If we choose not to test, we will need to acknowledge taking on potential risks for a statistically significant percentage of the veteran population.

### Conduct unmoderated user testing
Leading questions from the moderator, talk out loud methodology, and observers on the call may have caused participants to act differently than they usually would in an unmoderated environment.
