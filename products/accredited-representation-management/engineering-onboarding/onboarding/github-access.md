# How to Get GitHub Access

1. Create a GitHub account OR use one that you already have (yes, you can use your personal one)
2. Once you have a GitHub account, do the following:
    1. On your GitHub account, go to Profile → Settings → Emails
    2. Add your work email here (e.g., if you work at Ad Hoc, you'd add your Ad Hoc work email here)
    3. On your GitHub account, go to Profile → Settings → SSH and GPG keys
    4. Create an SSH key. Follow [this](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) link for help.
