# Product Outline: Accredited Representation Management

---

## Overview
Create a high-quality accessible service or suite of services within VA.gov to serve Veterans in managing their Power of Attorney (PoA) representation and to support the deprecation of the legacy system used to take those actions.

## Problem Statement
There is not currently an experience on VA.gov for Veterans to find a representative and appoint PoA.  The current experience happens either in person (offline) or through an older system called eBenefits which does not provide a great user experience: confusing errors, dead ends, and inconsistent user flows. 

**How might we unify this process on VA.gov and provide users with clear instructions and expectations around next steps?**
 
## Desired User Outcomes
#### MVP
1. Veterans can search for accredited representatives on VA.gov and filter by location and representative type (VSOs, attorneys and claims agents)
2. Veterans have a clear understanding of the different types of representatives (VSOs, attorneys and claims agents)
3. Veterans can easily see if they already have an appointed representative on file
4. Veterans can select a VSO, attorney or claims agents on VA.gov for new representation
5. Veterans can fill out (but not submit) a 21-22 or 21-22a form on VA.gov
6. Veterans can download a filled-out 21-22 or 21-22a form (PDF format) from VA.gov
7. Veterans will be given guidance on next steps, including obtaining a representative signature and submitting their form outside of VA.gov (in person, via mail, through an online tool like QuickSubmit)

#### Post-MVP 
1. Veterans will be able to submit their 21-22 or 21-22a form digitally on VA.gov
2. On related VA.gov interactions that may benefit from appointing PoA, Veterans can easily transition to searching for a representative and appointing PoA

## Undesired User Outcomes
1. Veterans are unable to easily or successfully appoint PoA on VA.gov
2. Veterans are unable to easily or successfully manage their PoA (including changing and removing representation) on VA.gov
3. Veterans continue to submit 21-22 or 21-22a forms outside of VA.gov (in person, via mail, through an online tool like QuickSubmit)

## Desired Business Outcomes

1. Increase the functionality of VA.gov to support searching and appointing representatives
2. Provide Veterans with an easy, safe and accessible experience for appointing and managing PoA on VA.gov
3. Reduce the time it takes for Veterans to find and appoint a representative and appoint PoA
4. Facilitate and support claim automation initiatives and processes aimed at reducing the amount of time it takes to render decisions and deliver benefits
5. Expedite the deprecation of the legacy eBenefits platform and legacy SEP product by delivering replacement services

## Undesired Business Outcomes

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
1. **% of users by traffic source**
   _Where are users coming into our product flow from?_
3. **% of users who end up downloading a form after initiating a search** 
    _Are users making it through the entire flow?_
    1. Drop off points to track could include:
        1. Display search results, but no selection
        2. Made a selection, but did not complete the form pre-fill
4. **Average time (minutes) from search → form download**
    _How long does it take to complete the entire flow?_
    1. Could be broken out by steps so we can understand which steps are taking longer
    2. Would be nice to pair the average metric with a bar chart that shows the minutes from initiating a search to downloading a form (to understand the average and median, but also the range)
5. **% of authenticated users who initiate a search** (logged on vs. not logged on)
    _How many of our users are logged into a VA.gov account?_
6. **% of authenticated users who end up downloading a form after initiating a search**
    _How many of our users are looking for replacement representation?_

### Baseline KPI Values
1. **Number of users completing the search→form download in VA.gov each week/month** _measuring growth_
2. **% increase of users completing the search→form download this week/month vs. last week/month** _measuring proportional growth_

### Objectives and Key results (OKRs)
1. **Objective**: Veterans start moving away from legacy processes for finding a representative, in favor of our solution on VA.gov 
    1. **Key Result**: % of week-over-week/month-over-month growth for users initiating a search
        _Comparing baseline KPI values over time to examine growth_
2. **Objective**: Our MVP flow on VA.gov allows users to successfully find a representative and download a pre-filled 21-22/21-22a form
    1. **Key result**: % of users who end up downloading a form after initiating a search
        _KPI #1 from above_
    2. **Key result**: Average time (minutes) from search → form download
        _KPI #2 from above_

## Assumptions
1. Veterans are interested in searching for a representative and appointing PoA on their own, as long as they have a clear understanding of the process

## Solution Approach
**Next step:** Our immediate goal is to provide Veterans with functionality that exists today, but on a unified website (VA.gov).  The plan is to kick off with an MVP which will mirror the same functionality on eBenefits (searching for a representative and digitally filling out a 21-22 or 21-22a form), but with a more consistent and intuitive experience that lives directly on VA.gov.  

**For future:** Our ultimate goal is to allow Veterans to search for a representative AND appoint PoA entirely on VA.gov.  Appointing PoA requires digital submission of a 21-22 or 21-22a form, which we currently do not have supporting API endpoints from Lighthouse to use.  To support digital submission, we plan to:
1. Identify support for these Lighthouse API endpoints
2. Investigate how to apply signatures from two parties to achieve digital form submission
4. Consider notifications for when a representative request is approved/rejected
5. Explore additional features like managing open requests for representatives and managing existing representative relationships
6. Integrate with other products or experiences that involve Veterans looking for a representative
7. Implement a satisfaction survey to assess the user perceptions of our product experience
