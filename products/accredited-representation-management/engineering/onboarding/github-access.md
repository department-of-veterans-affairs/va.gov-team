# How to get Github Access
1. Create a Github account OR use one that you already have (Yes you can use your personal one)
2. Once you have a github account do the following:
    1. On your Github account go to Profile -> Settings -> Emails
    2. Add your work email here (EX: If you work at Ad Hoc you'd add your Ad Hoc work email here)
    3. On your Github account go to Profile -> Settings -> Ssh and gpg keys
    4. Create an ssh key. Follow [this](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) link for help.
