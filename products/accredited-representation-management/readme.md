# Accredited Representation Management (ARM)

_Formerlly known as Find a Representative (FAR)_

This product is being revisited in 2023 with the goal of migrating the Veteran experience around finding a representative from the legacy eBenefits platform, to VA.gov.

The Accredited Representation Management (ARM) team is part of the Accredited Reps Crew in the OCTO Benefits Portfolio.

## Product Development

We are currently in discovery which includes:
- Secondary UX research across Github repositories, VA.gov, Mural boards, Subject Matter Expert (SME) interviews and external resources (Reddit, YouTube, Google, etc.)
- Review of previous development work around this initiative

After discovery, we will move into defining our MVP and outlining work within this repo.  Issues pertaining to this product will be tagged with our `find-a-rep-team` label.
