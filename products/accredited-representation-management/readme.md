# Accredited Representation Management (ARM)

_Formerlly known as Find a Representative (FAR)_

The Accredited Representation Management (ARM) team is part of the Accredited Reps Crew in the OCTO Benefits Portfolio.

**Mission**: Create a high-quality, accessible suite of services within VA.gov to serve Veterans in managing their representation, and to support the deprecation of legacy systems (eBenefits, OGC) currently being used for these actions.
