# Staged Rollout Details

- Limited production access to the v2 features of Appoint a Representative will be controlled through the frontend feature toggle `representative_status_enable_v2_features`
- Errors will be tracked in Datadog and will trigger a Slack alert to our team channel #benefits-representation-management-notifications, to initiate our rollback process (detailed below)

#### Rollout dates: May 22 - June 2, 2025
_The Profile page typically has ~130k users per week, but it can climb up to ~150k users per week._
1. Stage A: 5% of users - Thursday, 5/22
2. Stage B: 25% of users - Tuesday, 5/27

## Rollback Process

While we cannot think of any events that would be critical enough to merit a rollback, the following rollback process has been outlined just in case we need it.

**The rollback process is:**
1. Turn off the frontend feature toggle `representative_status_enable_v2_features` 
   1. Submit a PR
2. Alert the team in [#benefits-representation-management](https://slack.com/archives/C05L6HSJLHM) that the rollback process has been initiated
   1. Include any details as to what triggered the rollback
   2. Tag relevant teammates (@benefits-arm-core, @benefits-ar-enablement)
3. Create a ticket to document:
   1. A summary of what caused the rollback process
   2. Confirmation that the feature toggle has been turned off (or that a PR has been submitted)
   3. Next step ideas for solving the rollback trigger
   4. Other relevant links/images
   5. Link to initial Slack alert for reference
4. Follow up in the Slack alert thread with a link to the ticket
