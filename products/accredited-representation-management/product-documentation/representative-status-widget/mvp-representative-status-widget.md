# Representative Status Widget MVP

Developed by the Accredited Representation Management team, the Representative Status Widget will provide insight into any current representation.  This will be paired with the [Appoint a Representative](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/accredited-representation-management/mvp-appoint-a-representative.md) flow, but has an opportunity to live in other areas of VA.gov.

The MVP will include desktop & mobile experiences

1. Widget States
   1. User is logged in and has an existing representative (surface the status and the representative information)
   2. User is logged in and does not have an existing representative (include information on how to find a representative)
   3. User is not logged in (include copy on how signing in can assist with the appointing a representative process)
   4. Error state / system is down (show a message that the system is unavailable and to try again later)  
2. Include widget in the profile to display selected representative (pending request with link to next steps)

## Post-MVP
1. Link/integrate with other, related experiences
2. Satisfaction survey to assess the user perceptions of our product experience
3. Consider scenarios where a Veteran may have multiple representatives, each appointed to assist with different responsibilities
