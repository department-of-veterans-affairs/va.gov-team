## Staged Rollout Details

- Rollout date range: 5/13-5/20
- Feature Toggle: `representative_status_enabled` will be disabled in Production prior to staged rollout and will be enabled to an increasing % of users during the rollout. This will control visibility of the Representative Status Widget on our [Find a Representative page](https://www.va.gov/get-help-from-accredited-representative/find-rep/).
- Errors will be tracked in Sentry and Datadog, and will trigger a Slack alert to our team channel #benefits-representation-management-notifications, to initiate our rollback process (detailed above)


## Staged Rollout Schedule
**Go/No Go meeting 5/13 at 1:30p ET**
1. Stage A: 10% of users on 5/13 (Monday)
2. Stage B: 50% of users on 5/15 (Wednesday)
3. Stage C: 100% of users on 5/20 (Monday)
4. Stage D: Add the Representative Status Widget to the [Accredited Rep landing page](https://www.va.gov/get-help-from-accredited-representative/)

## Rollback Process

While we cannot think of any events that would be critical enough to merit a rollback, the following rollback process has been outlined just in case we need it.

**The rollback process is:**
1. Turn off the frontend feature toggle `representative_status_enabled`
   1. Submit a PR
2. Alert the team in [#benefits-representation-management](https://slack.com/archives/C05L6HSJLHM) that the rollback process has been initiated
   1. Include any details as to what triggered the rollback
   2. Tag relevant teammates (@benefits-arm-core, @benefits-arm-enablement, @benefits-arm-vba)
3. Create a ticket to document:
   1. A summary of what caused the rollback process
   2. Confirmation that the feature toggle has been turned off (or that a PR has been submitted)
   3. Next step ideas for solving the rollback trigger
   4. Other relevant links/images
   5. Link to initial Slack alert for reference
4. Follow up in the Slack alert thread with a link to the ticket
