# Product Outline: Find a Representative
Team: Accredited Representation Management

---

## Overview
Create a user-friendly, accessible tool for Veterans to search for an accredited representative on VA.gov. This experience is intended to mirror the search functionality of older, external tools: [OGC](https://www.va.gov/ogc/apps/accreditation/index.asp) and [eBenefits](https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/vso-search).

## Problem Statement
There is not currently an experience on VA.gov for Veterans to find a representative. The current experience happens either in person (referrals) or on older systems (eBenefits, OGC) which do not provide a great user experience: confusing errors, dead ends, and inconsistent user flows.

**How might we enable Veterans to find an accredited representative on VA.gov?**
 
## Desired User Outcomes
1. Veterans can search for accredited representatives on VA.gov and filter by location and representative type (VSOs, attorneys and claims agents)
2. Veterans have a clear understanding of the different types of representatives (VSOs, attorneys and claims agents)

## Desired Business Outcomes 
1. Increase the functionality of VA.gov to support searching for accredited representatives
2. Reduce the time it takes for Veterans to find an accredited representative
3. Expedite the deprecation of the legacy eBenefits platform by delivering replacement services

## Assumptions
1. Veterans are interesting in searching for a representative on VA.gov
2. Veterans are more likely to appoint VSOs, Attorneys and Claims Agents
3. Only a small percentage of Veterans are interested in appointing individual representatives in a VSO

## Solution Approach
Our immediate goal for the Find a Representative MVP is to mirror the representative search functionality on eBenefits, but with critical/impactful updates found through user research.  From there, we will examine the experience through usability testing and incorporate findings into a version 2.0.  Ultimately, we hope to provide a more consistent and intuitive "Find a Representative" experience that lives directly on VA.gov.

## Launch Strategy
A landing page "Get help from a VA accredited representative or VSO" (rooted in the Resources and Support section of VA.gov) will include a link to the Find a Representative tool.  There will be multiple entry points into the landing page, stemming from the main navigation as well as in-context with related benefits pages.

### Launch Dates
1. MVP target release: December 2023 -- **No Go** due to the data powering our search results being only ~50% accurate
2. Version 2.0 target release: March 2024
  
### Future
When our [Appoint a Representative product](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/accredited-representation-management/product-documentation/appoint-a-representative) goes live, we will work with stakeholders to redirect related pages within [eBenefits]([https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/vso-search).  

We may also redirect the [legacy OGC representative search](https://www.va.gov/ogc/apps/accreditation/index.asp), if there are no downstream effects.

## Solution Narrative

### Current Status
Find a Representative 2.0 is in development and the team is partnering with OGC and our VSO liaison to define a plan for updating contact information for all accredited representatives.

### Key Decisions
1. An MVP [originally scheduled for Dec 2023 release](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/accredited-representation-management/product-documentation/find-a-representative/release-plan-find-a-representative-mvp.md) was decidedly a "No Go" from the team, due to the data powering our search results being only ~50% accurate.  While the ARM team does not own this data, there are shared concerns with providing inaccurate search results to our users.
   1. To remedy this decision, the team has decided to implement solutions in our product to address this issue.  The team will also be working directly with OGC to really representatives for updated contact information.
   2. Until then, our team will incorporate findings from research for a v2.0
2. Version 2.0 is scheduled for March 2024 release
