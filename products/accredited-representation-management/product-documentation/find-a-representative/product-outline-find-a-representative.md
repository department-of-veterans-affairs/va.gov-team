# **Product Outline: Find a Representative**

**Team**: Accredited Representation Management

Product URL: [ Find a VA accredited representative or VSO](https://www.va.gov/get-help-from-accredited-representative/find-rep)

Main entry points:
1. [VA.gov homepage](https://www.va.gov/)
2. [Get help from a VA accredited representative or VSO](https://www.va.gov/get-help-from-accredited-representative/) (landing page)


## **Overview**

Create a user-friendly, accessible tool for Veterans to search for an accredited representative on VA.gov. This experience is intended to mirror the search functionality of older, external tools:[ OGC](https://www.va.gov/ogc/apps/accreditation/index.asp) and[ eBenefits](https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/vso-search).


## **Problem Statement**

There is not currently an experience on VA.gov for Veterans to find a representative. The current experience happens either in person (referrals) or on older systems (eBenefits, OGC) which do not provide a great user experience: confusing errors, dead ends, and inconsistent user flows.

**How might we enable Veterans to find an accredited representative on VA.gov?**


## **Desired User Outcomes**

1. Veterans can search for accredited representatives on VA.gov and filter by location and representative type (VSOs, attorneys and claims agents)
2. Veterans have a clear understanding of the different types of representatives (VSOs, attorneys and claims agents)


## **Desired Business Outcomes**

1. Increase the functionality of VA.gov to support searching for accredited representatives
2. Reduce the time it takes for Veterans to find an accredited representative
3. Expedite the deprecation of the legacy eBenefits platform by delivering replacement services


## **Assumptions**

1. Veterans are interested in searching for a representative on VA.gov
2. Veterans are more likely to appoint VSOs, Attorneys and Claims Agents
3. Only a small percentage of Veterans are interested in appointing individual representatives within a VSO

Targeted to release in December 2023, but a "No Go" was determined after discovering the representative data powering search results was only ~50% accurate.

## **Recommended Next Steps**

#### Next Version Priorities - Find a Representative 3.0
A future version of Find a Representative should strive for:
1. Advanced filters, for users to refine their search results based on the associated VSO, a representative's name, and their method of contact (online, in person, both).
2. A detail page for search results, to reduce the initial search result cognitive load and allow for scalability of representative inforamtion on VA.gov.

[Figma designs for Find a Representative 3.0](https://www.figma.com/design/bzbwObT9hiItve0q3cQX9c/ARM---Find-and-Appoint-a-Representative?node-id=0-19109&p=f&t=9UDkWLdMS1C7DVfU-0) have already been completed.

We recommend these designs undergo usability testing and be updated based on reasearch findings. After this, Find a Representative 3.0 will be ready for develpoment!

Please refer to these epics, to bring the Find a Representative 3.0 designs into Production:
1. [ARM Research: Find a Representative 3.0](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/97783) - validate v3 designs with user testing, and report on findings.
2. [ARM Design: Find a Representative 3.0](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/98591) - update v3 designs based on research findings, and finalize for handoff to development.
3. [ARM Development: Find a Representative 3.0](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/80758) - development of v3, based on finalized designs.

#### Known Bugs
Some bugs have been identified for our Production experience. These have not yet been addressed due to lower priority, feel free to prioritize + address as needed.

[Known bugs are stored in this view of the Github project board](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/1180/views/41). 

#### Redirect Goals
When [Appoint a Representative](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/accredited-representation-management/product-documentation/appoint-a-representative) is out of pilot for the online submission of VA Form 21-22 (i.e. most, or all VSOs can accept online submissions), we will work with stakeholders to redirect related pages within eBenefits:
1. https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenfits/vso-search - redirect to Find a Representative
2. https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenfits/about/feature?feature=request-vso-representative - redirect to Appoint a Representative
3. https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenfits/manage/representative - redirect to landing page

There may be an opportunity to redirect the following OGC Accreditation Search pages to Find a Representative, if there are no downstream effects. **Before proceeding with this redirect, connect with OGC and GCLAWS stakeholders to understand if any tools rely on this webpage.**
1. https://www.va.gov/ogc/apps/accreditation/index.asp
2. https://www.va.gov/ogc/apps/accreditation/accredpeople.asp (and all child pages)

#### Future Ideas
Longer term ideas are stored in our[ARM Future Ideas](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/vaabdvro/Shared%20Documents/Accredited%20Representation%20Management/ARM%20Future%20Ideas.docx?d=wfe95a788166e4670bfda5a59798550d7&csf=1&web=1&e=7iFIw0) document.
