# **Product Outline: Find a Representative**

Team: Accredited Representation Management

Product URL:[ Find a VA accredited representative or VSO](https://www.va.gov/get-help-from-accredited-representative/find-rep)

Main entry point:[ Get help from a VA accredited representative or VSO](https://www.va.gov/get-help-from-accredited-representative/) (landing page)


## **Overview**

Create a user-friendly, accessible tool for Veterans to search for an accredited representative on VA.gov. This experience is intended to mirror the search functionality of older, external tools:[ OGC](https://www.va.gov/ogc/apps/accreditation/index.asp) and[ eBenefits](https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/vso-search).


## **Problem Statement**

There is not currently an experience on VA.gov for Veterans to find a representative. The current experience happens either in person (referrals) or on older systems (eBenefits, OGC) which do not provide a great user experience: confusing errors, dead ends, and inconsistent user flows.

**How might we enable Veterans to find an accredited representative on VA.gov?**


## **Desired User Outcomes**

1. Veterans can search for accredited representatives on VA.gov and filter by location and representative type (VSOs, attorneys and claims agents)
2. Veterans have a clear understanding of the different types of representatives (VSOs, attorneys and claims agents)


## **Desired Business Outcomes**

1. Increase the functionality of VA.gov to support searching for accredited representatives
2. Reduce the time it takes for Veterans to find an accredited representative
3. Expedite the deprecation of the legacy eBenefits platform by delivering replacement services


## **Assumptions**

1. Veterans are interested in searching for a representative on VA.gov
2. Veterans are more likely to appoint VSOs, Attorneys and Claims Agents
3. Only a small percentage of Veterans are interested in appointing individual representatives in a VSO


## **Solution Approach**

Our immediate goal for Find a Representative is to mirror the representative search functionality on eBenefits, but with critical/impactful updates found through user research. From there, we will examine the experience through usability testing and incorporate findings into future versions. Ultimately, we hope to provide a more consistent and intuitive "Find a Representative" experience that lives directly on VA.gov.


## **Measuring Success**

Monthly performance metrics are currently documented in Sharepoint: the [Performance Metrics](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/sites/vaabdvro/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2Fvaabdvro%2FShared%20Documents%2FAccredited%20Representation%20Management%2FPerformance%20Metrics\&viewid=3fa7a9bb%2D3d4e%2D44c2%2Db93f%2D629268a08e72) folder includes raw data, which is summarized in the monthly [Sprint Report](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/sites/vaabdvro/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2Fvaabdvro%2FShared%20Documents%2FAccredited%20Representation%20Management%2FVeteran%20Facing%20Sprint%20Reports%20and%20Demos\&viewid=3fa7a9bb%2D3d4e%2D44c2%2Db93f%2D629268a08e72) decks.

We are actively working with the Platform Analytics team to visualize our[ ARM OKRs](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1718224425278/b300ea8d63dcaaa0cdad0ebf6b4a65a20fcc9371?sender=ubac5f0487f25bc4431288699) in a Domo dashboard at a future time.

## **Future Plans and Ideas**

When [Appoint a Representative](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/accredited-representation-management/product-documentation/appoint-a-representative) v2 (with digital submission) is released, we will work with stakeholders to redirect related pages within[ eBenefits](https://www.docstomarkdown.pro/convert-markdown-to-google-docs-online/%5Bhttps://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/vso-search).

We may also redirect the[ legacy OGC representative search](https://www.va.gov/ogc/apps/accreditation/index.asp), if there are no downstream effects.

While timeline is TBD, ideas for the next version are stored in our [Find a Representative v3](https://dsva.slack.com/docs/T03FECE8V/F086REGJ0JY) Slack canvas. Longer term ideas for Find a Representative are stored in our[ ARM Future Ideas](https://dsva.slack.com/docs/T03FECE8V/F06JUJ4CR19) Slack canvas.
