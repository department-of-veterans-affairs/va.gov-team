# Product Outline: Find a Representative
Team: Accredited Representation Management

---

## Overview
Create a user-friendly, accessible tool for Veterans to search for an accredited representative on VA.gov. This experience is intended to mirror the search functionality of older, external tools: [OGC](https://www.va.gov/ogc/apps/accreditation/index.asp) and [eBenefits](https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/vso-search).

## Problem Statement
There is not currently an experience on VA.gov for Veterans to find a representative. The current experience happens either in person (referrals) or on older systems (eBenefits, OGC) which do not provide a great user experience: confusing errors, dead ends, and inconsistent user flows.

**How might we enable Veterans to find an accredited representative on VA.gov?**
 
## Desired User Outcomes
1. Veterans can search for accredited representatives on VA.gov and filter by location and representative type (VSOs, attorneys and claims agents)
2. Veterans have a clear understanding of the different types of representatives (VSOs, attorneys and claims agents)

## Desired Business Outcomes 
1. Increase the functionality of VA.gov to support searching for accredited representatives
2. Reduce the time it takes for Veterans to find an accredited representative
3. Expedite the deprecation of the legacy eBenefits platform by delivering replacement services

## Assumptions
1. Veterans are interesting in searching for a representative on VA.gov
2. Veterans are more likely to appoint VSOs, Attorneys and Claims Agents
3. Only a small percentage of Veterans are interested in appointing individual representatives in a VSO

## Solution Approach
Our immediate goal for the Find a Representative MVP is to mirror the representative search functionality on eBenefits, but with a more consistent and intuitive experience that lives directly on VA.gov.  

We will be conducting a usability test on the Find a Representative MVP and a month after launch, we will iterate on this tool for a v2 that incorporates findings from user research findings and navigation/traffic analytics. The v2 could include:
1. Additional search parameters, including individual representatives in Veteran Service Organizations
2. Satisfaction survey to assess the user perceptions of our product experience
3. Integration with OGC APIs for direct access to accredited representative data
4. Adjustment/addition of entry points to the Find a Representative tool

## Launch Strategy
### MVP Launch 
1. Any VA.gov links to eBenefits or OGC that set expectations around searching for a representative will be re-routed to the Find a Representative tool
    1. Note: Any links on VA.gov that set expectations around appointing a representative will be re-routed to Appoint a Representative when that MVP launches
2. A landing page for "Find and appoint a VA accredited representative" (rooted in the Resources and Support section of VA.gov) will include a link to the Find a Representative tool
    1. TBD: There will be multiple entry points into the landing page, stemming from the main navigation as well as in-context with related benefits pages
  
### v2 Launch
Based on user research findings and navigation/traffic analytics, consider:
1. Adjusting/adding entry points
2. Enhancements to the Find a Representative experience

## Launch Dates
1. MVP target launch date: December 2023
    1. MVP launch will mirror the rep search functionality on eBenefits

2. v2 target launch date: February 2024
    1. v2 launch will include updates based on user research findings and navigation/traffic analytics
