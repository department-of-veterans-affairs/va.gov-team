# Find a Representative 3.0 Overview

Developed by the Accredited Representation Management team, the Find a Representative product will allow Veterans to search for an accredited representative on VA.gov.

The following overview demonstrates the changes we'll be implementing for version 3.0, based on research findings and our discovery of inaccurate representative data.  

🚧 This experience is currently in the design/research phase, and not yet available on VA.gov.
