# Release Plan: Find a Representative 2.0


### Development

Feature Toggles:

1.  `find_a_representative_enable_api` will be enabled prior to staged rollout
2.  `find_a_representative_enable_frontend` will be disabled prior to staged rollout and will be enabled to an increasing % of users during the staged rollout. This will control visibility of both our Find a Rep product and it's related entry point on the CAIA landing page

### Validation

#### Technical Preparation
- [ ] Follow [best practices for QA](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/qa-and-accessibility-testing)
- [ ] Unit tests and E2E tests are complete
- [ ] QA by Michael + ARM team
- [x] Mapbox is ready for use (frontend)
- [x] Address Validator in Lighthouse is ready for use (backend)

#### Content Preparation
- [x] New landing page content has been reviewed for accuracy and approved by stakeholders
- [x] The react widget has been added to the landing page
- [x] Entry points are ready to be redirected to the landing page

#### Data Consideration
- [ ] Discuss the pros and cons with releasing our MVP, knowing that the data from OGC has inaccuracies

#### Go/No Go meeting TBD
- [ ] review the plan with your DEPO/OCTO representative.
- [ ] review the release plan with your team.

## Rollback Process

While we cannot think of any events that would be critical enough to merit a rollback, the following rollback process has been outlined just in case we need it.

**The rollback process is:**
1. Turn off the frontend feature toggle `find_a_representative_enable_frontend`
   1. Submit a PR
2. Alert the team in [#benefits-representation-management](https://slack.com/archives/C05L6HSJLHM) that the rollback process has been initiated
   1. Comment on the initial Slack alert thread, also sending the message to the channel (checkbox)
   2. Tag relevant teammates (Holden, Jonathan, Colin, Lindsay, Michael, Janelle, Jennifer, Lesley, Alex, Sam, Steve)
3. Create a ticket to document:
   1. A summary of what caused the rollback process
   2. Confirmation that the feature toggle has been turned off (or that a PR has been submitted)
   3. Next step ideas for solving the rollback trigger
   4. Other relevant links/images
   5. Link to initial Slack alert for reference
4. Follow up in the Slack alert thread with a link to the ticket

## Staged Rollout Details

- Rollout date range: 3/5-3/18

2. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders?
3. Which assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated?
4. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
