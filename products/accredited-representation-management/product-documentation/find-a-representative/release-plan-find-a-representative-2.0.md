# Release Plan: Find a Representative 2.0


### Development

Feature Toggle:
`find_a_representative_enabled` will be disabled prior to staged rollout and will be enabled to an increasing % of users during the staged rollout. This will control visibility of both our Find a Rep product and it's related entry point on the CAIA landing page

### Validation

#### Platform Preparation
- [x] Are all Collaboration Cycle touchpoints complete?

#### Technical Preparation
- [x] Follow [best practices for QA](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/qa-and-accessibility-testing)
- [x] Unit tests and E2E tests are complete
- [x] QA by Michael + ARM team
- [x] Mapbox is ready for use (frontend)
- [x] Address Validator in Lighthouse is ready for use (backend)
- [x] Any lingering issues that are needed to address prior to rollout?

#### Content Preparation
- [x] New landing page content has been reviewed for accuracy and approved by stakeholders
- [x] The react widget has been added to the landing page
- [x] Entry points are ready to be redirected to the landing page

#### Data Consideration
- [x] Discuss the pros and cons with releasing our MVP, knowing that the data from OGC has inaccuracies

#### Go/No Go meeting 3/5/2024 at 12:30p ET
- [x] review the plan with your DEPO/OCTO representative.
- [x] review the release plan with your team.

**Verdict: "Conditional Go" after we're able to resolve the open issue with the csrfToken.**

## Rollback Process

While we cannot think of any events that would be critical enough to merit a rollback, the following rollback process has been outlined just in case we need it.

**The rollback process is:**
1. Turn off the frontend feature toggle `find_a_representative_enable_frontend`
   1. Submit a PR
2. Alert the team in [#benefits-representation-management](https://slack.com/archives/C05L6HSJLHM) that the rollback process has been initiated
   1. Include any details as to what triggered the rollback
   2. Tag relevant teammates (@benefits-arm-core, Jennifer, Lesley, Alex, Sam, Steve)
3. Create a ticket to document:
   1. A summary of what caused the rollback process
   2. Confirmation that the feature toggle has been turned off (or that a PR has been submitted)
   3. Next step ideas for solving the rollback trigger
   4. Other relevant links/images
   5. Link to initial Slack alert for reference
4. Follow up in the Slack alert thread with a link to the ticket

## Staged Rollout Details

- Rollout date range: 3/11-3/20
- Limited production access will be controlled through the frontend feature toggle `find_a_representative_enabled` 
- Errors will be tracked in Sentry and will trigger a Slack alert to our team channel #benefits-representation-management-notifications, to initiate our rollback process (detailed above)


## Staged Rollout Schedule
**Go/No Go meeting 3/5/2024 at 12:30p ET**
1. Stage A: 10% of users on 3/11 (Monday)
2. Stage B: 100% of users on 3/13 (Wednesday) + launch best bets for an initial boost to visibility
3. Stage C: Implement redirects on 3/18 (Monday) for an added boost to visibility
4. Stage D: Begin entry point work on 3/20 (Wednesday) so pages point directly to the [Accredited Rep landing page](=(https://www.va.gov/get-help-from-accredited-representative/)

## Post-Launch Questions

_To be completed once you have gathered your initial set of data, as outlined above._

1. **How do the KPIs you gathered compare to your pre-launch definition(s) of "success"?**
2. **What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders?** VBA and OGC request to allow users to sort or filter search results by VSO, CAIA content request to consolidate representative definitions into a single additional component.
3. **Which assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated?**
4. **How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?** We will take in feature requests and feedback and consider everything comprehensively for a v3 version of Find a Representative (timeline TBD).
5. **What technical tasks are needed to clean up (i.e., removal of feature toggles)?** None that we're aware of, the feature toggle has already been removed.
