[Product Outline for Find a Representative](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/accredited-representation-management/product-documentation/find-a-representative/product-outline-find-a-representative.md	
)	

## **Recommended Next Steps**	

#### Next Version Priorities - Find a Representative 3.0	
A future version of Find a Representative should strive for:	
1. Advanced filters, for users to refine their search results based on the associated VSO, a representative's name, and their method of contact (online, in person, both).	
2. A detail page for search results, to reduce the initial search result cognitive load and allow for scalability of representative inforamtion on VA.gov.	

[Figma designs for Find a Representative 3.0](https://www.figma.com/design/bzbwObT9hiItve0q3cQX9c/ARM---Find-and-Appoint-a-Representative?node-id=0-19109&p=f&t=9UDkWLdMS1C7DVfU-0) have already been completed.	

We recommend these designs undergo usability testing and be updated based on reasearch findings. After this, Find a Representative 3.0 will be ready for develpoment!	

Please refer to these epics, to bring the Find a Representative 3.0 designs into Production:	
1. [ARM Research: Find a Representative 3.0](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/97783) - validate v3 designs with user testing, and report on findings.	
2. [ARM Design: Find a Representative 3.0](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/98591) - update v3 designs based on research findings, and finalize for handoff to development.	
3. [ARM Development: Find a Representative 3.0](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/80758) - development of v3, based on finalized designs.	

#### Known Bugs	
Some bugs have been identified for our Production experience. These have not yet been addressed due to lower priority, feel free to prioritize + address as needed.	

[Known bugs are stored in this view of the Github project board](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/1180/views/41). 	

#### Redirect Goals	
When [Appoint a Representative](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/accredited-representation-management/product-documentation/appoint-a-representative) is out of pilot for the online submission of VA Form 21-22 (i.e. most, or all VSOs can accept online submissions), we will work with stakeholders to redirect related pages within eBenefits:	
1. https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenfits/vso-search - redirect to Find a Representative	
2. https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenfits/about/feature?feature=request-vso-representative - redirect to Appoint a Representative	
3. https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenfits/manage/representative - redirect to landing page	

There may be an opportunity to redirect the following OGC Accreditation Search pages to Find a Representative, if there are no downstream effects. **Before proceeding with this redirect, connect with OGC and GCLAWS stakeholders to understand if any tools rely on this webpage.**	
1. https://www.va.gov/ogc/apps/accreditation/index.asp	
2. https://www.va.gov/ogc/apps/accreditation/accredpeople.asp (and all child pages)
