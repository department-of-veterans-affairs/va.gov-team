# What to do if someone reaches out about updating representative contact info.

Note: The below content is only to be used on an individual basis to those who reach out to the team or adjacent teams directly. OGC is working on a larger task of creating a fact sheet for VSOs which we could then send to larger teams such as the contact center.

1. Inform the Accredited Representation Management team
    1. If you have OCTO Slack access, post in #benefits-representation-management 
    2. If not, email jennifer.bertsch@va.gov, shannon.ford1@va.gov, lindsay.li-smith@va.gov, marisa.dominguez@va.gov
2. Provide the below "Guidance for Representatives" content to the individual who reached out on how to update the representative contact information.
3. ARM team only: Log the occurrence in the "Occurrences" section below.
4. ARM team only: If more than 5 occurrences happen within 7 days contact OGC (Jonathan Taylor and Nathan Kroes).

## Guidance for Representatives
The messaging below can be copied/pasted into an email response, to the representative seeking help updating their information.

## Additional Guidance for VSO Representatives, If Needed
The following information should only be provided IF ASKED.

If the VSO representative does not know who their certifying official is, we can help to uncover this.

1. To determine the Certifying Official a VSO representative can reach out to, view the [GCLAWS Accreditation database](https://ogccowbd1.dva.va.gov/Reports/report/Accreditation/Accreditation) and click the Save icon to download an Excel export.
2. Open the export and view the "VSOs" tab.
3. In the "VSOs" tab, locate the organization and you will be able to see the Certifying Official's name along with any contact information.
4. For good measure, search for the Certifying Official in Find a Representative to see if any additional contact information is available.

If the certifying official does not know how to contact OGC, we can recommend the email address `accreditationmailbox@va.gov`.
