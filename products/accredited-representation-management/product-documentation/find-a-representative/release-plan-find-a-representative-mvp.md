## Rollback Process

While we cannot think of any events that would be critical enough to merit a rollback, the following rollback process has been outlined just in case we need it.

**The rollback process is:**
1. Turn off the feature toggle
   1. Submit a PR
2. Alert the team in [#benefits-representation-management](https://slack.com/archives/C05L6HSJLHM) that the rollback process has been initiated
   1. Comment on the initial Slack alert thread, also sending the message to the channel (checkbox)
   2. Tag relevant teammates (Holden, Jonathan, Colin, Lindsay, Michael, Janelle, Zach, Lesley, Alex, Steve)
3. Create a ticket to document:
   1. A summary of what caused the rollback process
   2. Confirmation that the feature toggle has been turned off (or that a PR has been submitted)
   3. Next step ideas for solving the rollback trigger
   4. Other relevant links/images
   5. Link to initial Slack alert for reference
4. Follow up in the Slack alert thread with a link to the ticket

2. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders?
3. Which assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated?
4. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
5. What technical tasks are needed to clean up (i.e., removal of feature toggles)?
