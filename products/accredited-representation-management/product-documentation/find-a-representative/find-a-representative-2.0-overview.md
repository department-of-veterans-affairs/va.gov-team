# Find a Representative 2.0 Overview

Developed by the Accredited Representation Management team, the Find a Representative product will allow Veterans to search for an accredited representative on VA.gov.

The following overview demonstrates the changes implemented for version 2.0, based on research findings and our discovery of inaccurate representative data.
