# Decision and Change Log: Content and Information Architecture

This document is actively maintained by Product Manager, Lindsay Li-Smith, and updates are made every Friday.

- **12/4/2023**: Stakeholder feedback is incorporated into landing page.\
  _Confirmed by CAIA Content Editor A Procik (_[_Slack message_](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C05L6HSJLHM/p1701698627241959)_). Feedback requested by Product Manager Lindsay Li-Smith via email “Review by Fri 12/2: Representative Landing Page” and received from Lisa Koenigsberg (OIT), Martin Caraway (VBA), Jessica Pierce, Jenny Rosenau and Kayce White (Compensation Service)._
- **3/12/2024**: Decided that it's best to lead with "accredited representative" as an umbrella term, before introducing specific types of accredited representatives, like "VSO." The order of these terms in the H1 doesn't impact findability or SEO, so we shouldn't change it. \
  _Confirmed retroactively by CAIA content partner, A Procik ([Github comment](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/90397#issuecomment-2286980488))_.
- :tada: **3/12/2024**: [Get help from a VA accredited representative or VSO](https://www.va.gov/get-help-from-accredited-representative/) landing page is published. \
  _Published by CAIA ([Github comment](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/67034#issuecomment-1989100865) confirming ready to publish)_.
- **3/18/2024**: Redirected [va.gov/disability/get-help-filing-claim](https://www.va.gov/disability/get-help-filing-claim/) and [va.gov/decision-reviews/get-help-with-review-request](https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/get-help-with-review-request/) to the accredited representative landing page. \
  _Redirect implemented by the Public Websites team_ ([redirect plan](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/SitewideCAIA/EXzlPiBgEiBKmYFApzlvs2oBxVQhSWag-nxboeMTNRLnNQ?e=I7Rpfu)).
- **3/18/2024**: CAIA will be deprecating the “Veteran Service Officer” term across VA.gov.\
  _Decided by CAIA content ([meeting notes](https://dsva.slack.com/docs/T03FECE8V/F065KP8MRHA?focus_section_id=temp:C:GGKa8a581d429694eecac216dcd5))._

  _Published by CAIA (_[_Github ticket_](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/68394)_)._
- **4/26/2024**: Redirected [benefits.va.gov/vso/index.asp](https://benefits.va.gov/vso/index.asp) to the accredited representative landing page.\

- **6/12/2024**: Added a “Get help from an accredited representative or VSO” link to the [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) footer, replacing the “Accredited claims representatives” OGC link. CAIA approved a slight deviation from the page’s H1 (Get help from a VA accredited representative or VSO), to ensure the link title would resonate with Veterans. \
  _Link language was recommended by Lead Information Architect Mikki Northuis and CAIA Content Lead Beth Potts (_[_Github comment_](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/84354#issuecomment-2153486227)_)._
- **7/22/2024**: Added [va.gov/ogc/accreditation.asp](https://www.va.gov/ogc/accreditation.asp) to the right rail on the disability hub landing page, which follows an already-established pattern for including non-Veteran-facing content on [VA.gov](http://VA.gov).\
  _CAIA received Disability compensation stakeholders approval ([Github comment](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/65809#issuecomment-2233214580)) and Product Owner Jennifer Bertsch advises that we don't need OGC's approval, but should inform them of this change ([Slack message](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C05L6HSJLHM/p1721403857190059?thread_ts=1721232811.854969\&cid=C05L6HSJLHM))._
- **7/24/2024**: Confirmed that there are no stakeholders required to approve the redirect of [benefits.va.gov/vso](https://www.benefits.va.gov/vso) to our FAQ page, but it's best to inform our VBA and OGC stakeholders after this redirect has been completed.\
  _Product Owner Jennifer Bertsch confirmed and Product Manager Lindsay Li-Smith communicated this to CAIA ([Slack message](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C05L6HSJLHM/p1721851542854749?thread_ts=1721760411.524119&cid=C05L6HSJLHM))._
- **7/30/2024**: Updated the "More information" section at the bottom of the landing page to include a link to OGC's accreditation website, and to reference "filing a complaint" in the description of the FAQ link. \
  _This recommendation was provided by OCTO’s information architecture lead, Mikki Northuis, and Product Owner, Jennifer Bertsch, in response to an email "GAO recommendations for making the OGC accredited representatives web pages more easily findable?" with OGC stakeholder, Christa Shriber.  Product Manager Lindsay Li-Smith requested this change from CAIA and Content Lead Beth Potts published this change ([Github comment](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/65809#issuecomment-2258929954))._

  _This was requested by Product Owner, Jennifer Bertsch, in an email "request: updating links on choose.va.gov" and the update was confirmed by Bronwyn Emmet, the director of Outreach._
- **8/5/2024**: Began engaging with other VA.gov product teams to update entry points to legacy pages like [va.gov/vso](https://va.gov/vso/) and [va.gov/ogc/recognizedvsos.asp](https://www.va.gov/ogc/recognizedvsos.asp) to instead point to our landing page.\
  _Product Manager Lindsay Li-Smith began this conversation with the core ARM team and broke off into separate thread to engage other VA.gov product teams, to request entry point updates ([Slack message](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C05L6HSJLHM/p1722880231966739))._
- **8/7/2024**: Informed VBA and OGC stakeholders of the redirect of [va.gov/vso](https://va.gov/vso/) and [va.gov/ogc/recognizedvsos.asp](https://www.va.gov/ogc/recognizedvsos.asp) to our FAQ page.\

  _CAIA content partner A Procik confirmed in ([Slack message](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C05L6HSJLHM/p1723148921019749?thread_ts=1722880231.966739&cid=C05L6HSJLHM))._
- **8/8/2024**: While content standards recommend spelling out an acronym the first time it's mentioned on a page, we are making some excpetions for "VSO".  Veterans are most familiar with the "VSO" term so we want to highlight that first for user recognition and will define the acronym in the following sentence of body copy.\
  _CAIA content partner A Procik confirmed in ([Slack message](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C01K37HRUAH/p1723151194544469?thread_ts=1723136972.151189&cid=C01K37HRUAH))._
