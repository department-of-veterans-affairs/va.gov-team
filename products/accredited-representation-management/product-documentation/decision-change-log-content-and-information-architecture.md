- **3/18/2024**: CAIA will be deprecating the “Veteran Service Officer” term across VA.gov.\

  _Published by CAIA (_[_Github ticket_](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/68394)_)._
- **4/26/2024**: Redirected [benefits.va.gov/vso/index.asp](https://benefits.va.gov/vso/index.asp) to the accredited representative landing page.\
  _Redirect implemented by the Public Websites team_ ([redirect plan](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/SitewideCAIA/EXzlPiBgEiBKmYFApzlvs2oBxVQhSWag-nxboeMTNRLnNQ?e=I7Rpfu)).
- **6/12/2024**: Added a “Get help from an accredited representative or VSO” link to the [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) footer, replacing the “Accredited claims representatives” OGC link. CAIA approved a slight deviation from the page’s H1 (Get help from a VA accredited representative or VSO), to ensure the link title would resonate with Veterans. \
  _Link language was recommended by Lead Information Architect Mikki Northuis and CAIA Content Lead Beth Potts (_[_Github comment_](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/84354#issuecomment-2153486227)_)._
- **7/22/2024**: Added [va.gov/ogc/accreditation.asp](https://www.va.gov/ogc/accreditation.asp) to the right rail on the disability hub landing page, which follows an already-established pattern for including non-Veteran-facing content on [VA.gov](http://VA.gov).\
  _CAIA received Disability compensation stakeholders approval ([Github comment](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/65809#issuecomment-2233214580)) and Product Owner Jennifer Bertsch advises that we don't need OGC's approval, but should inform them of this change ([Slack message](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C05L6HSJLHM/p1721403857190059?thread_ts=1721232811.854969\&cid=C05L6HSJLHM))._
- **7/24/2024**: Confirmed that there are no stakeholders required to approve the redirect of [benefits.va.gov/vso](https://www.benefits.va.gov/vso) to our FAQ page, but it's best to inform our VBA and OGC stakeholders after this redirect has been completed.\
  _Product Owner Jennifer Bertsch confirmed and Product Manager Lindsay Li-Smith communicated this to CAIA ([Slack message](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C05L6HSJLHM/p1721851542854749?thread_ts=1721760411.524119&cid=C05L6HSJLHM))_
