# Decision and Change Log: Accreditation API

- **6/4/2025**: Spotty API connection -- it was working, then access was denied, then later only some of the endpoints were returning a valid response).\
   _Decided at the Accredited Rep Lead meeting ([Meeting notes](https://dsva.slack.com/docs/T03FECE8V/F06H1TS0GBZ?focus_section_id=temp:C:IdV1d618ad5d37947208be72ddd0))._
- **7/16/2025**: There were records for all reprsentative types in the API's UAT environment (connected to our Staging Environment), but the data fields were empty. After GCLAWS updates, it seems the majority of records are now missing from the UAT endpoints.\
