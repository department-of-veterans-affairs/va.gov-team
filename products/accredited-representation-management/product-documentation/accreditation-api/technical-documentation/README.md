# Accreditation API - Integration Documentation

This directory contains documentation for the Accreditation API integration within the Accredited Representation Management (ARM) system. This integration enables direct data synchronization from the OGC GCLAWS (General Counsel Legal Administrative Workstation System) API to the vets-api PostgreSQL database, replacing manual file-based processes.

## Overview

The Accreditation API integration provides:
- Automated daily synchronization of accredited representative data from OGC GCLAWS
- Data processing for attorneys, claims agents, representatives, and organizations
- Address validation through Lighthouse Address Validation API integration
- Modernized data pipeline replacing manual Excel file processing
- Enhanced data accuracy and consistency for Find a Representative and Appoint a Representative features

This integration utilizes the vets-api PostgreSQL database to store processed and validated representative information.

## Project Status

**Current State**: Integration development complete, pending production deployment

**Feature Flag**: `find_a_representative_use_accredited_models` - Currently disabled in production, enabled in staging for testing

## Technical Architecture

## Database Integration

This system integrates with the **primary vets-api PostgreSQL database** through:

- **AccreditedIndividual Records**: Storage of attorneys, claims agents, and VSO representatives with complete contact and accreditation details
- **AccreditedOrganization Records**: VSO organization information with headquarters and contact data
- **Address Validation**: Integration with Lighthouse Address Validation API for geocoding and address standardization
- **Automated Processing**: Daily Sidekiq background jobs for data synchronization and validation
- **Data Integrity**: Stale data cleanup and record counting with monitoring alerts
