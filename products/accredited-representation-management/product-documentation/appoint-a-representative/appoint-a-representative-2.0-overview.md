# Appoint a Representative 2.0 Overview

Developed by the Accredited Representation Management team, the Appoint a Representative will support Veterans in a digital form fill of the 21-22/21-22a which is required for appointing a representative. 

The following overview demonstrates the changes we'll be implementing for version 2.0, based on research findings and input from our stakeholders.

1. Digital submission of 21-22
    1. Available for authenticated users of VA.gov
    2. Available for VSOs that accept online requests for representation
    3. Notifications (partner with VA Notify and Lighthouse)
       1. Representative approved request
       2. Representative declined request
2. The ability to appoint an organization without first selecting an individual VSO Representative


## Future Iteration

1. Digital submission of 21-22a (feature flag?)
    1. Determine if we can support digital submission for attorneys and claim agents who often require fee agreements before accepting
    2. Identify how the insurance field impacts Power of Attorney
    3. Authenticated users only
1. Manage requests (can the vet cancel a request)
1. Manage rep (can the vet cancel an existing rep)
2. Satisfaction survey to assess the user perceptions of our product experience
3. Consider how we might support situations where multiple representatives are assigned (Claim PoA vs. Claimant PoA)
4. Consider showing an error state if the user is [deceased, incompetent, or has a fiduciary appointed](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/use-cases/blocked-account.md)
5. Explore if there is an acceptable [esignature option for unauthorized users](https://design.va.gov/patterns/ask-users-for/signature)
6. Explore how to assist the homeless population with requesting representation, as they often do not have an address, phone number and/or access to internet to check email
7. Explore an option for a quick link or QR code, where a representative's information is quickly added to the 21-22/21-22a
