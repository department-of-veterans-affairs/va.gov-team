# Release Plan: Appoint a Representative 2.0 (Online Submission)

Feature Toggle/flag:
`appoint_a_representative_enable_v2_features` will be disabled prior to staged rollout and will be enabled as part of the 2.0 rollout. 

This feature toggle is setup for authenticated users and we can also enable early access in Production to individual users, via email address.

#### Go/No Go Meeting
- [x] Test the 2.0 flow in Production
- [x] Review the release plan
- [x] Determine a verdict

On March 14, 2025 we had a Go/No Go call with ARF and Lighthouse to test the flow in Production. The following issues were found:
1. Limitations on medical authorizations are not apperaing correctly in ARP (https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/104435). **LAUNCH BLOCKING**
2. The Confirmation and Decline email notifications are not being sent in Production (https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/105296).
3. The Accept email notification was not sent in Production (Lighthouse is working to resolve).
4. The POA request moved to established, but was still appearing as pending in ARP due to the email failure (Lighthouse is working to resolve).

The team is awaiting the medical authorization fix to deploy to Production before gathering again for another Go/No Go Production test.

On March 24, 2025 we had a second Go/No Go call with ARF and Lighthouse to retest the flow in Production. The issues found above have all been resolved and the team has agreed to "Go", after ARF confirms with the Connecticut Department of Veterans Affiars (the first VSO to accept online submission).

**Verdict: Ready to release on March 25, 2025**

## Rollback Process

While we cannot think of any events that would be critical enough to merit a rollback, the following rollback process has been outlined just in case we need it.

**The rollback process is:**
1. Turn off the frontend feature toggle `appoint_a_representative_enable_v2_features` 
   1. Submit a PR
2. Alert the team in [#benefits-representation-management](https://slack.com/archives/C05L6HSJLHM) that the rollback process has been initiated
   1. Include any details as to what triggered the rollback
   2. Tag relevant teammates (@benefits-arm-core, @benefits-arm-enablement, @benefits-arm-vba)
3. Create a ticket to document:
   1. A summary of what caused the rollback process
   2. Confirmation that the feature toggle has been turned off (or that a PR has been submitted)
   3. Next step ideas for solving the rollback trigger
   4. Other relevant links/images
   5. Link to initial Slack alert for reference
4. Follow up in the Slack alert thread with a link to the ticket
