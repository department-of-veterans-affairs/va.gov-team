# Release Plan: Appoint a Representative 2.0 (digital submission pilot)


### Development

Feature Toggle/flag:
`appoint_a_representative_enable_v2_features` will be disabled prior to staged rollout and will be enabled as part of the 2.0 rollout. 

This feature toggle is setup for authenticated users and we can also enable early access in Production to individual users, via email address.

### Validation

#### Platform Preparation
- [ ] All "launch blocking" items from Staging Review have been addressed
- [ ] All "should fix" items from QA have been addressed
- [ ] Contact Center Review is complete 
- [ ] Privacy, Security, IA Readiness Review is complete

#### Technical Preparation
The following will take place right before Staged Rollout:
- [ ] Enable digital submissions for Connecticut Department of Veterans Affairs in Production [#101542](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/101542)
- [ ] Enable digital submission email confirmation in VA Notify Production [#101050](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/101050)
- [ ] Enable expiration email notifications in VA Notify Production [#100841](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/100841)

#### Go/No Go meeting TBD
- [ ] review the release plan with your team.
- [ ] review the plan with your OCTO representative.
- [ ] test the 2.0 flow with Kevin Schneider / Sam Raudabaugh ❓

**Verdict:TBD**

## Staged Rollout Details

- Limited production access to the v2 features of Appoint a Representative will be controlled through the frontend feature toggle `appoint_a_representative_enable_v2_features`
- Errors will be tracked in Datadog and will trigger a Slack alert to our team channel #benefits-representation-management-notifications, to initiate our rollback process (detailed above)

**Rollout date range: March 11, 2025**
1. Stage A: Enable for Kevin Schneider and Sam Raudabaugh ❓
2. Stage B: 100% of users on March 11 (Tuesday) + implement Datadog monitoring in Production [#99975](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/99975)

## Rollback Process

While we cannot think of any events that would be critical enough to merit a rollback, the following rollback process has been outlined just in case we need it.

**The rollback process is:**
1. Turn off the frontend feature toggle `appoint_a_representative_enable_v2_features` 
   1. Submit a PR
2. Alert the team in [#benefits-representation-management](https://slack.com/archives/C05L6HSJLHM) that the rollback process has been initiated
   1. Include any details as to what triggered the rollback
   2. Tag relevant teammates (@benefits-arm-core, @benefits-arm-enablement, @benefits-arm-vba)
3. Create a ticket to document:
   1. A summary of what caused the rollback process
   2. Confirmation that the feature toggle has been turned off (or that a PR has been submitted)
   3. Next step ideas for solving the rollback trigger
   4. Other relevant links/images
   5. Link to initial Slack alert for reference
4. Follow up in the Slack alert thread with a link to the ticket
