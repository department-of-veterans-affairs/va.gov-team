## Troubleshooting

### Errors and Metrics

Errors and performance metrics for the 'Appoint a Representative' feature are captured through Sentry and Datadog respectively.

#### Error Logging

- **Sentry Integration:** Sentry captures any runtime errors and exceptions in the application.

#### Performance Metrics

- **Datadog Monitoring:** Datadog monitors the application's performance -- it track metrics like response times, server load, and API call frequencies.

- **ARM's Datadog Service:** ARM's Datadog service is called [_representation-management_](https://vagov.ddog-gov.com/apm/services/representation-management/operations/rack.request/resources?dependencyMap=qson%3A%28data%3A%28telemetrySelection%3Aall_sources%29%2Cversion%3A%210%29&deployments=qson%3A%28data%3A%28hits%3A%28selected%3Aversion_count%29%2Cerrors%3A%28selected%3Aversion_count%29%2Clatency%3A%28selected%3Ap95%29%2CtopN%3A%215%29%2Cversion%3A%210%29&env=eks-prod&fromUser=false&groupMapByOperation=null&isInferred=false&panels=qson%3A%28data%3A%28%29%2Cversion%3A%210%29&resources=qson%3A%28data%3A%28visible%3A%21t%2Chits%3A%28selected%3Atotal%29%2Cerrors%3A%28selected%3Atotal%29%2Clatency%3A%28selected%3Ap95%29%2CtopN%3A%215%29%2Cversion%3A%211%29&summary=qson%3A%28data%3A%28visible%3A%21t%2Cchanges%3A%28%29%2Cerrors%3A%28selected%3Acount%29%2Chits%3A%28selected%3Acount%29%2Clatency%3A%28selected%3Alatency%2Cslot%3A%28agg%3A95%29%2Cdistribution%3A%28isLogScale%3A%21f%29%2CshowTraceOutliers%3A%21t%29%2Csublayer%3A%28slot%3A%28layers%3Aservice%29%2Cselected%3Apercentage%29%2ClagMetrics%3A%28selectedMetric%3A%21s%2CselectedGroupBy%3A%21s%29%29%2Cversion%3A%211%29&start=1732205570609&end=1732209170609&paused=true) and is part of the [_OCTO Benefits Portfolio_](https://vagov.ddog-gov.com/organization-settings/teams/02d65116-27e9-11ee-ad54-da7ad0900007/benefits) team.

### Issue Investigation Steps

This section outlines the steps to investigate and resolve issues related to the "Appoint a Representative" feature.

#### Initial Assessment

- **Identify the Issue:** Use Sentry and Datadog alerts to identify the issue. Determine whether it's an API failure, a frontend error, or a performance bottleneck.
- **Impact Analysis:** Assess the impact of the issue. Determine how many users are affected and the severity of the impact on the feature's functionality.

#### Detailed Investigation

- **Log Analysis:** Review Sentry logs to pinpoint the error's origin. Look for stack traces, error messages, and the conditions under which the error occurred.
- **Reproduction:** Attempt to reproduce the issue in a test environment based on the information from Sentry and user reports.
- **Cross-Reference Metrics:** Use Datadog to cross-reference performance metrics around the time the issue occurred. This can help identify if the issue is isolated or part of a larger systemic problem.

#### Resolution and Follow-Up

- **Fix Implementation:** Once the issue is identified and understood, develop a fix. This could involve code changes, configuration updates, or infrastructure adjustments.
- **Testing and Deployment:** Test the fix thoroughly in a staging environment before deploying to production.
- **Monitoring Post-Fix:** Closely monitor Sentry and Datadog after deploying the fix to ensure the issue is resolved and no new issues have arisen.
- **Postmortem Analysis:** Conduct a postmortem analysis to understand the root cause and document learnings. Update the playbook accordingly to improve response for future incidents.

### Flipper Features and Rollback

- Enables Appoint a Representative frontend - `appoint_a_representative_enable_frontend`
- Enables Appoint a Representative PDF generation endpoint - `appoint_a_representative_enable_pdf`
- Use the original veteran_x models to power Appoint a Rep entity search - `use_veteran_models_for_appoint`

## Security

PII and PHI is collected from authenticated users who start or complete the Appoint a Representative form flow; the data is encrypted and temporarily saved in the SiP (Save in Progress) forms table -- `in_progress_forms` -- in the VA.gov Postgresql database. From our understanding, the data is purged after 60 days.

When the request to generate the 21-22/21-22a PDF is made, the user's PII and PHI data is encrypted in transit via HTTPS but the data, including the generated PDF, is not persisted anywhere.
