(_[_calendar link_](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvbacoweba5.vba.va.gov%2Fbl%2F21%2Fcalendar%2Fcal_Week.asp\&data=05%7C02%7C%7Cfb5aa9ac2a8144f1c2c108dc27cdcb98%7Ce95f1b23abaf45ee821db7ab251ab3bf%7C0%7C0%7C638429012045422344%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C\&sdata=za8k4WgCpYWf0LMiovJ54HLgaxR%2BSPHvtbzrV87ZVN4%3D\&reserved=0)_)._
- **2/21/2024**: Required fields for 21-22 and 21-22a forms are defined, with input from Compensation Service stakeholders. \
_Input was requested by Product Manager Lindsay Li-Smith via email “21-22/21-22a Required Fields?” and provided by Jenny Rosenau and Jessica Pierce with Compensation Service (_[required form fields](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/accredited-representation-management/product-documentation/appoint-a-representative/required-form-fields.md)_)._
- **4/25/2024**: MVP is updated to include feedback from multiple rounds of stakeholder review (VBA, OGC, OIT/VEO, Compensation Service).\
  _Communicated by Product Manager Lindsay Li-Smith via email “Design Review: Appoint a Rep (Digital form fill of 21-22/21-22a)”._
- **6/10/2024**: Decided to move forward with the search results experience where we show cards as the search result. No longer pursuing our "fuzzy search" design due to accessibility concerns from both Governance and Design System Council.\
  _Communicated by Product Manager Lindsay Li-Smith ([Github comment](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/84521#issuecomment-2159012482))._
- **6/12/2024**: Defined the MVP experience for LOA1 and LOA3 authenticated users, choosing to route any users with an incomplete profile through the "unauthenticated" text input experience.  This will reduce friction (no need to verify identity or call to update information) on the form-fill experience and supports VA's larger goal of digitizing form experiences. \
  _Confirmation received from Product Owner Jennifer Bertsch ([Slack message](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C05L6HSJLHM/p1718231009653709?thread_ts=1718137835.902289\&cid=C05L6HSJLHM))._
- **6/24/2024**: VA OI\&T Privacy Officer approves the MVP email notification (confirmation and next steps).\
  _Product Manger Lindsay Li-Smith requested approval via email “Seeking Privacy Officer for email Notification Content Approval” and Privacy Officer Gina Siefert confirmed there are no PHI concerns._
- **7/16/2024**: Confirming MVP will release before v2 work will begin, as there are still dependencies to figure out prior to v2 release.\
  _Confirmed at the ARM Leadership Sync ([meeting notes](https://dsva.slack.com/docs/T03FECE8V/F05SKGFB50Q?focus_section_id=temp:C:VBD1ae1d5de3ac54a0d9e1c1261c))._
- **7/18/2024:** Confirmed MVP will target Veteran and non-Veteran claimant users (no “I am the accredited representative” path). The representative path was removed from MVP to reduce scope to launch, and because there were still open questions regarding the rep-initiated user experience.\
  _Discussed by the core ARM team in the July 17 demo, with VA Enablement and stakeholders present. Confirmed with the team the next day in standup ([Github comment](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/67741#issuecomment-2237204197))._
- **7/22/2024**: Do not push contact information updates to the Profile. \
  _Confirmed by Product Owner Jennifer Bertsch ([Slack message](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C05L6HSJLHM/p1721064185404579))._
- **7/30/2024**: Determined that 2.0 should release on [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) (Veteran-facing) and _not_ the Accredited Representative Portal (VSO-facing).  In order to protect Veterans from unauthorized disclosure of personal and private information, the Veteran must sign a paper form or provide an electronic signature via their va.gov login method. \
  _Confirmed by Product Owner Jennifer Bertsch ([Slack Message](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C05SUUM4GAW/p1722360689132869)), based on guidance from Compensation Services ([detailed response and guidance in Sharepoint](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/vaabdvro/Shared%20Documents/Accredited%20Representatives/RFI-Accredited%20Representative%20initiating%2021-22%20POA%20request.docx?d=we0c18763433f46fca7b3e5ae69d0c244&csf=1&web=1&e=FBlw1B))._
- **8/7/2024**: Confirmed with stakeholders that there are valid scenarios where a user may want to re-submit a 21-22/21-22a for a representative they already have appointed. This could be to renew access to records (which expires after 5 years) or to change their consent to certain authorizations. \
  _Confirmed by stakeholders Jenny Rosenau (Compensation Service), Nathan Kroes (OGC) and Martin Caraway (VBA) in email "Re-appointing a currently appointed representative"._
- **8/15/2024**: Decided to save the prefill pattern for a future iteration of Appoint a Representative as it was adding 60-70% complexity for gathering claimant/Veteran info -- something we did not originally plan for, but discovered after diving into development. \
  _Proposed by Product Manager Lindsay Li-Smith and approved by Product Owner Jennifer Bertsch ([Slack Message](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C05L6HSJLHM/p1723759381357219))_
- **Pending**: Decide if the Request POA service lives in Lighthouse or vets-api
