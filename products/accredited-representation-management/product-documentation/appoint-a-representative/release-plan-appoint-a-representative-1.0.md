# Release Plan: Appoint a Representative 1.0 (MVP)


### Development

Feature Toggle/flag:
`appoint_a_representative_enable_frontend` will be disabled prior to staged rollout and will be enabled to an increasing % of users during the staged rollout. This will control visibility of both our Appoint a Representative product and it's related entry point on the CAIA landing page

### Validation

#### Platform Preparation
- [ ] All "launch blocking" items from Staging Review have been addressed
- [ ] Contact Center Review is complete
- [ ] Privacy, Security, IA Readiness Review is complete

#### Content Preparation
- [ ] The react widget has been added to the landing page
- [ ] Entry points to our landing page are ready to be added to the "About VA Form" pages for the [21-22](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-22/) and [21-22a](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-22a) 

#### Technical Preparation
- [ ] Enable backend feature flag `use_veteran_models_for_appoint` to use the legacy tables (since the Accreditation API is not yet available)
- [ ] Enable backend feature flag `appoint_a_representative_enable_pdf` to allow for searching for representatives in Appoint, generating the PDF, and sending the email notification.
- [ ] Any lingering issues that are needed to address prior to rollout?

#### Go/No Go meeting **TBD**
- [ ] review the release plan with your team.
- [ ] review the plan with your OCTO representative.

**Verdict:ðŸ”®**

## Rollback Process

While we cannot think of any events that would be critical enough to merit a rollback, the following rollback process has been outlined just in case we need it.

**The rollback process is:**
1. Turn off the frontend feature toggle `appoint_a_representative_enable_frontend` 
   1. Submit a PR
2. Alert the team in [#benefits-representation-management](https://slack.com/archives/C05L6HSJLHM) that the rollback process has been initiated
   1. Include any details as to what triggered the rollback
   2. Tag relevant teammates (@benefits-arm-core, @benefits-arm-enablement, @benefits-arm-vba)
3. Create a ticket to document:
   1. A summary of what caused the rollback process
   2. Confirmation that the feature toggle has been turned off (or that a PR has been submitted)
   3. Next step ideas for solving the rollback trigger
   4. Other relevant links/images
   5. Link to initial Slack alert for reference
4. Follow up in the Slack alert thread with a link to the ticket
