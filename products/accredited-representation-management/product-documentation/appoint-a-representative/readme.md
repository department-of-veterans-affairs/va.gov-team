## **Recommended Next Steps**

#### Next Version Priorities - Appoint a Representative 3.0
A future version of Appoint a Representative should strive for:
1. Updating the contact information entry pages, to use the prefill pattern and ensure any updates are also updated in the user's Profile.
   1. This will eliminate an existing risk: [Appoint a Representative is capturing a Veteran email address that is not aligned with Profile](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/accredited-representation-management/product-documentation/appoint-a-representative/product-outline-appoint-a-representative.md#appoint-a-representative-is-capturing-a-veteran-email-address-that-is-not-aligned-with-profile).
   2. Current implementation leans on text-input components that are pre-populated with Profile information, but any edits do not get routed back to Profile.
2. Features that did not make the version 2.0 release date - UX and accessibility improvements, code cleanup.

#### Expanding the online submission of 21-22
Currently a handful of VSOs are able to accept the online submission of 21-22 as a "pilot" initiative. As the pilot expands, or even comes to and end, there will be a need to [enable online submission for additional VSOs](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/accredited-representation-management/product-documentation/appoint-a-representative/enabling-online-submission-for-vsos.md).

#### Redirect Goals

When [Appoint a Representative](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/accredited-representation-management/product-documentation/appoint-a-representative) is out of pilot for the online submission of VA Form 21-22 (i.e. most, or all VSOs can accept online submissions), we will work with stakeholders to redirect related pages within eBenefits:
1. https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenfits/vso-search - redirect to Find a Representative
2. https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenfits/about/feature?feature=request-vso-representative - redirect to Appoint a Representative
3. https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenfits/manage/representative - redirect to landing page
