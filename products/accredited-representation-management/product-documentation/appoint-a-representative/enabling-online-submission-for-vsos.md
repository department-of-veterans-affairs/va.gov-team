# Enabling Online Submission for VSOs

Appoint a Representative has the option to end in online submission of VA Form 21-22 (to appoint a Veteran Service Organization). This feature is available to LOA3 Veteran users, that are appointing a VSO with online submission enabled.

### Steps to enable online submission for additional VSOs
1. Determine the VSO's POA code
   1. View the [OGC Accreditation Search website](https://www.va.gov/ogc/apps/accreditation/index.asp)
   2. In the 3rd, lower section, select the "VSOs with Reps" radio option and click the "Download" button.
   3. The download will be titled `orgexcellist.asp` -- rename the file to be `orgexcellist.xls` (essentially changing the file type).
   4. Open the `orgexcellist.xls` in Excel
   5. Locate the organization in Column A and the associated POA code is in Column B
2. Request help from Platform Support to enable online submission
   1. In the OCTO/DSVA Slack space, post in the #vfs-platform-support channel "Can someone please help run this query in a rails console, in Production?" and include a version of the query below.
   2. Example query: `Veteran::Service::Organization.where(poa: ['00V', '036']).update_all(can_accept_digital_poa_requests: true)`
      1. In this example, online submission is being turned on for two VSOs with the POA codes `'00V', '036'`.
      2. Make sure that you replace the POA code(s) with the one(s) you identified in Step 1.
   3. Platform Support may respond, asking if this can be achieved with a migration or rake task. If they do, respond letting them know that:
      1. A migration is not necsesary becuase the query is not updating the schema of the table.
      2. A rake task has the benefit of test coverage, but someone in Platform Support with Production access would still need to run the task; might as well run the query which has the same result.
      3. Provide assurance that this query is safe to run.
      4. If needed, you can reference the [previous Slack request](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/CBU0KDSB1/p1751297197519949) where this was hashed out.
   4. After Platform Support runs the initial query, you can ask them (in the same Slack thread/inquiry) to run the following query to confirm online submission was successfully enabled.
      1. Example query: `Veteran::Service::Organization.find_by(poa: '00V')`
         1. In this example, online submission is being turned on for the VSO with the POA codes `'00V'`.
         2. Make sure that you replace the POA code with the one you identified in Step 1.
      2. The returned object should confirm that `can_accept_digital_poa_requests` is set to `true`. 
      3. If online submission is being enabled for multiple VSOs, run the query multiple times with the different POA codes.
3. Confirm online submission is enabled in VA.gov Production
   1. Log into VA.gov Production, with an LOA3 Veteran user of VA.gov
   2. Navigate to [Appoint a Representative](https://www.va.gov/get-help-from-accredited-representative/appoint-rep/introduction)
   3. Indicate you're a Veteran claimant
   4. Search for the VSO (or a representative within the VSO)
   5. Confirm in the search results that the VSO/VSO representative now states "Accepts VA Form 21-22 online"


### Example of online submission enabled
In this example, you can see that Brian Daniel is part of a VSO that accepts the online submission of VA Form 21-22. Lisa Daniel is not and can only accept VA Form 21-22 by mail or in person.

## Previous work to enable online submission
Online submission was enabled in June 2025 for Wounded Warrior Project and Montana Dept of Veterans Affairs. As an example of the above process [here is the ticket to track the work](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/112473) and the related [Platform Support Slack request](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/CBU0KDSB1/p1751297197519949).
