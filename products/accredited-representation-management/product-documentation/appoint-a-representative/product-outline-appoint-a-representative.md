# Product Outline: Appoint a Representative
Team: Accredited Representation Management

---

## Overview
Create a user-friendly, accessible tool for Veterans to digitally complete a 21-22 or 21-22a form, with the ultimate goal of appointing an accredited VSO, Attorney or Claims Agent. This experience is intended to mirror the search functionality of the older, external tool [eBenefits]([url](https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/vso-search)).

## Problem Statement
There is not currently an experience on VA.gov for Veterans to appoint a representative. The current experience happens either in person (offline) or through an older system (eBenefits) which does not provide a great user experience: confusing errors, dead ends, and inconsistent user flows.

**How might we enable Veterans to appoint a representative on VA.gov and provide clear instructions and expectations around next steps?**
 
## Desired User Outcomes
1. Veterans can select a VSO, attorney or claims agents on VA.gov for new representation
2. Veterans can fill out (but not submit) a 21-22 or 21-22a form on VA.gov
3. Veterans can download a filled-out 21-22 or 21-22a form (PDF format) from VA.gov
4. Veterans will be given guidance on next steps, including obtaining a representative signature and submitting their form outside of VA.gov (in person, via mail, through an online tool like QuickSubmit)

## Desired Business Outcomes 
1. Increase the functionality of VA.gov to support appointing accredited representatives
2. Reduce the time it takes for Veterans to appoint an accredited representative
3. Facilitate and support claim automation initiatives and processes aimed at reducing the amount of time it takes to render decisions and deliver benefits
4. Expedite the deprecation of the legacy eBenefits platform by delivering replacement services

## Assumptions
1. Veterans are interesting in appointing a representative online through VA.gov
2. Veterans would prefer to complete a form online, compared to printing the form out and completing it by hand

## Solution Approach
Our immediate goal for the Appoint a Representative MVP is to mirror the 21-22 / 21-22a digital form fill functionality on eBenefits, but with a more consistent and intuitive experience that lives directly on VA.gov.  

As we work towards this MVP, we will also be preparing for a future goal of digital submission by migrating EVSS endpoints to Lighthouse and working with the Representative Facing team.  A future iteration could include:

1. The ability to submit a 21-22 or 21-22a form digitally on VA.gov
2. Notifications when a representative request is accepted/rejected
3. Management of open requests for appointment
4. Management of current representation
5. Satisfaction survey to assess the user perceptions of our product experience
6. Consider how we might support situations where multiple representatives are assigned (Claim PoA vs. Claimant PoA)

--- 

## Launch Strategy
1. Any VA.gov eBenefits links that set expectations around appointing a representative will be re-routed to Appoint a Representative when that MVP launches
2. The About VA Form 21-22 page will include a link to the Appoint a Representative form-fill tool 
3. The MyVA page will include a reference to any in-progress and completed 21-22/21-22a forms
  
### v2 Launch
Based on user research findings and navigation/traffic analytics, consider:
1. Adjusting/adding entry points
2. Enhancements to the Find a Representative experience 

## Launch Dates
1. MVP target launch date: June 2024
