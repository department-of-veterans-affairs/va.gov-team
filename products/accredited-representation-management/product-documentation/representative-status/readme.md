# Representative Status - Read Me

[Product Outline for Representative Status](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/accredited-representation-management/product-documentation/representative-status-widget/product-outline-representative-status.md
)

## **Recommended Next Steps**

#### Next Version Priorities - Representative Status 2.1

A future version of Representative Status should strive to:
1. Bring the error rate (for calling the [Lighthouse Benefits Claims API](https://developer.va.gov/explore/api/benefits-claims/docs?version=current)) below 1%. Currently, the biggest impacts to error rate are when the API undergoes scheduled maintenance or has an unplanned incident/outage.
2. Improve UX and messaging around pending requests and the error state
3. Address known bugs

Please refer to these epics, to bring Representative Status 2.1 into Production:
1. [ARM Design: Representative Status 2.1](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/106743) - explore ideas to improve the Representative Status UX.
2. [ARM Development: Representative Status 2.1](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/115970) - reduce the error rate to below 1%, address known bugs, factor in any design updates.

#### Known Bugs
Some bugs have been identified for our Production experience. These have not yet been addressed due to lower priority, feel free to prioritize + address as needed.

[Known bugs are stored in this view of the Github project board](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/1180/views/41).
