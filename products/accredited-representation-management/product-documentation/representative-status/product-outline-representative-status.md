# **Product Outline: Representative Status**

**Team**: Accredited Representation Management

The Representative Status widget is available on the following pages:

1. [Find a VA accredited representative or VSO](https://www.va.gov/get-help-from-accredited-representative/find-rep)
2. [Get help from a VA accredited representative or VSO](https://www.va.gov/get-help-from-accredited-representative/)
3. [Profile Subpage: Accredited Representative](https://www.va.gov/profile/accredited-representative)
4. [MyVA Dashboard (link in "Claims and Appeals")](https://www.va.gov/my-va)

## **Overview**

Create a user-friendly, accessible service on VA.gov that reflects a user's (Veteran or claimant) current representative status. This includes both a lightweight widget and a detailed Profile subpage for LOA3 users.

## **Problem Statement**

There is not currently an experience on VA.gov for users to understand their current representative status. Without insight into existing representation, a Veteran or claimant may accidentally remove a representative who is actively assisting with a claim, potentially delaying their already lengthy claims process.

**How might we provide Veterans with insight into their current representative status on VA.gov?**

## **Desired User Outcomes**

1. Veterans and claimants can easily see if they have existing representation when interacting with the Find a Representative tool.
2. Veterans and claimants can easily see if they have existing representation when interacting with the Appoint a Representative tool.
3. Veterans and claimants can easily see their representative status in the Account Profile.

## **Desired Business Outcomes**

1. Increase the functionality of VA.gov to support Veteran insight into current representation.

## **Assumptions**

1. Many Veterans are unaware that they have a current representative appointed.
2. Veterans would like to see if they have current representation.

## **Recommended Next Steps**

#### Next Version Priorities - Representative Status 2.1

A future version of Representative Status should strive to:
1. Bring the error rate (for calling the [Lighthouse Benefits Claims API](https://developer.va.gov/explore/api/benefits-claims/docs?version=current)) below 1%. Currently, the biggest impacts to error rate are when the API undergoes scheduled maintenance or has an unplanned incident/outage.
2. Improve UX and messaging around pending requests and the error state
3. Address known bugs

Please refer to these epics, to bring Representative Status 2.1 into Production:
1. [ARM Design: Representative Status 2.1](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/106743) - explore ideas to improve the Representative Status UX.
2. [ARM Development: Representative Status 2.1](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/115970) - reduce the error rate to below 1%, address known bugs, factor in any design updates.
 
#### Known Bugs
Some bugs have been identified for our Production experience. These have not yet been addressed due to lower priority, feel free to prioritize + address as needed.

[Known bugs are stored in this view of the Github project board](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/1180/views/41). 

#### Future Ideas

Longer term ideas are stored in our [ARM Future Ideas](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/vaabdvro/Shared%20Documents/Accredited%20Representation%20Management/ARM%20Future%20Ideas.docx?d=wfe95a788166e4670bfda5a59798550d7&csf=1&web=1&e=7iFIw0) document.
