## Research Goals<a id="research-goals"></a>

### Veteran Journey

Veterans can get the help of a representative at any point in the journey where they are submitting benefits. Such as; starting up, taking care of myself, retiring, and aging.

[Full Veteran journey for reference.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)


### Goals

- Understand Veterans' motivations for seeking representation, why they selected their representative, and what that experience has been like.

- Understand usability of the authenticated Appoint a Representative flow (21-22/21-22a form) on both desktop and mobile devices.


### Outcome

- Information on Veterans’ motivations and behaviors surrounding representatives will inform the MVP and future experiences.

- User testing will inform adjustments to the Appoint a Representative flow (21-22/21-22a form) to improve usability.


## Research Questions<a id="research-questions"></a>

1. What prompts Veterans to find representation?

2. What has the Veterans’ experience been with their representatives?

3. Do Veterans’ understand the information shown? Is there any information missing?

4. What are Veterans’ expectations of the experience?

5. Are there any challenges with using the experience?

6. Are the next steps clear and actionable?


## Methodology<a id="methodology"></a>

**Semi-structured interview** / The interviewer will ask the Veterans a series of questions to learn about their representative selection process and engagement with their representative.

**Usability testing** / Veterans will be asked to engage with a live prototype to test usability, understandability of content, and desirability of features.


### User Testing Tasks

1. Veteran expectations and understanding of the landing page and next steps.

2. Show how you would sign-in to see your representative information.

3. Show where you would go to appoint a new representative.

4. Complete the 21-22 form. Provide feedback at each step.

5. Veteran expectations and understanding of the review page and next steps.


## Key Findings<a id="key-findings"></a>

1. Veterans continue to look to representatives for their expertise of the claims process, but have many different drivers and needs.

2. Peer referrals and online searches continue to be Veteran’s go to when searching for a representative to support them. With paid options being frequently seen, considered, and discussed.

3. Communication preferences vary person to person and situation to situation.

4. Veterans continue to have questions and lack awareness of VA accredited representatives and associated processes, impacting their ability to get timely support and benefits.

5. Continue to hear a high desirability for the Find a Representative feature, but awareness of options outside of healthcare or claims on VA.gov could limit Veterans ability to find the feature.


## Details of Findings<a id="details-of-findings"></a>

### Key Finding 1

**Veterans continue to look to representatives for their expertise of the claims process, but have many different drivers and needs, including;**

- Don’t know the process, so they rely on experts to file quickly and lessen the chance of filing improperly. (P1, P2, P7, P8, P10)

- Told by their peers that they should never file without a representative (peer pressure). (P4, P7, P10)

- Feels like a ‘full time job’ to file a claim, and would rather pay someone to take it off their plate. (P7, P10)

- Want to understand what they should apply for with help on a records review. (P2)

- Denial after a self filing, and now need help. (P5)

- VA doctor recommended filing for a claim in response to the PACT Act. (P11)

- _Quotes_

  - _“Well, because I'm not. I'm not astute on how to. you know. Document everything, and and and who to go to and how to respond to enquiries, you know, when and if they come and things like that I'm I'm you know. I'm a layman, you might say, and there were people out there who assist you and who are experts, who've been through this time and time again, and I haven't.” P1_

  - _“No, I understand if you apply for reconsideration or for an additional potential disability benefit that they have the opportunity to open up your current situation. Nobody has said they will. Nobody has said they won't. I've just heard and one organization I've spoken with. You know. Promises. No, no, no, don't worry about it. Don't worry about it, and I'm just you know I'm not trying to be quote unquote a pig. I just would like fair consideration. But I'm concerned about is it better just to stay with what I have rather than risk that, and potentially get nothing rather than be satisfied?” P1_

  - _“So I just went ahead and continued, filing on my own even though I've been told don't do that. Use somebody because it will be better for you. I was tired of waiting, so I just did it myself.” P4_

  - _“Well, basically. I got denied for a bunch of stuff, and so I needed to appeal. I guess. Okay, so yeah, I decided at that point I should try to get some help.” P5_

  - _“So in my experience. It was, you know, like a room full of government employee, military veterans, griping and groaning about their various levels of of disability, or like their knees hurting just normal veteran complaints. We reserve the right to complain endlessly. And I was just sort of like, yeah, like I'm not, this is my exact issue. That I said to my coworkers was of filing for disability and getting it processed, much less getting it assessed for a higher disability rating feels like it's a full time job ... It's a very bureaucratic, very labyrinthine, and I feel like in order to navigate this with expediency, and to get to my end state that I want like I would need to either be a professional in this field, or like this would be my full-time job for an extended, you know, like period of time. And that was when they came back. And they're like, Oh we all like. We all use the same person.” P7_

  - _“They know all the ins and outs of it, and the the chance of me filling something out improperly is certainly lessened.” P8_

  - _“I feel like a blubbering fool. I guess I just feel like as I'm saying all these things out loud. It's just like girl. You just lazy like you just all the things, and that's really why I got the attorney, cause I'm like, I don't know what I'm doing. It's not straightforward. No one's helping me. Not that anyone needs to, but still, like it seems so easy for everybody else. But I'm like I don't know what what format this is supposed to be like, I don't know.” P10_

  - _“So that's why I initiated the claim, based on some information that was provided from PACT Act and things that I have it impacted me. So that's where the push came from.” P11_


### Key Finding 2

**Peer referrals and online searches continue to be Veteran’s go to when searching for a representative to support them. With paid options being frequently seen, considered, and discussed.**

- Reasons why Veterans would consider paid representation included;

  - Not wanting to impact existing claims. (P1)

  - Having a complex claim, too complex for self-filing. (P2)

  - Not having time to put towards their claim. (P7, P10)

  - Hearing bad reviews about free services from peers. (P7, P10)

  - Not feeling as though VSOs are professional due to their bar/restaurant like nature. (P10)

- Some reasons Veterans would not consider paid help included;

  - Peer pressure not to, it’s frowned upon. (P10)

  - Not wanting to pay to file on a disability claim; seems easy to do themselves. (P11)

- Many Veterans did additional research about their considered representative by;

  - Discussing with peers, both known and unknown (such as Facebook groups).

  - Further online research.

  - Calling or going to the representative to meet them to build trust.

- Less commonly, Veterans were either ‘assigned’ a VSO by the VA hospital or started with their local Veteran Service Department.

- _Quotes_

  - _“Well, I Googled, you know, just to try to get some ideas and one organization responded, with their package, you might say. As to how they assist vets. Move forward. they do charge a fee they say they don't charge unless you are upgraded and come up with additional benefits. And then they charge a percentage of those fees. But everything sounds too good, you know. It just sounds like, oh, yeah, we can do this. We could do this, and and you know, everybody gets it, and and I know you know it just sounds like trying to take advantage, and I'm not sure I want to be part of that, although it seems like they've got experience. Then I've talked with another individual who secured an attorney and the attorney charges a flat fee, win or lose, and this individual who I spoke with did very well. But you know this person did very well, doesn't mean everybody does very well, and of course I always say I have no luck, you know. The only luck I have is bad luck. So again, I kinda take a step back, and I wonder whether it's worth moving forward. And then a Veteran's Officer, or who I had met with before. Who helped me fill out some paperwork at all. Was my next consideration and I haven't had an opportunity yet to speak in person with that person, and I'd rather have a face to face meeting rather than over the telephone before I make my decision. Whether I'm gonna pursue it or whether I'm gonna choose somebody other than her.” P1_

  - _“I would you know, kind of get lost. Looking around it to see what I need to even look at. There's a lot out there. And yeah. I think I just need someone laser focus like, Hey, look here at this specific spot and do these things.” P2_

  - _“If I felt that I had something that was debilitating and that that didn't make it through the claim process. Then I would. I would go to. I'd probably go to professional help. maybe first at that point.” P2_

  - _“It was an Internet search on help with filing claims.” P5_

  - _“Well, let's see, I called DAV. I guess that's what it is. Yeah, I called them and they actually yeah, they were one of the ones that told me they couldn’t help me and I don't remember which other organization I talked to. But I had the same problem.” P5_

  - _“So I have received, like some headway, just because the VA application process is understood. The meme is that it's very bureaucratic and opaque, and it's very slow. And several of my coworkers are also military veterans, and in the last 6 months they started sharing that they used an agent. This like to push their claims forward to get, you know, to get pumped from like 30% to 60%, 60 to 70, etc. And to that end, like, I had not had a whole lot of delta I hadn't seen like a whole lot of change, getting my claim process, in the first place, much, much less like having, like an increase in my disability rating. And so I around October, November of last year, just a stone's throw ago I just went to them. I was like, Okay, so like, what would you recommend to be agents that I should look into so that I can, you know, like I'm paying somebody to like work on this full time rather than like me doing it after work.” P7_

  - _“It was there that the claim was generated. Umhm, and from there it is out of the hands, then, of the Veteran Service Commission, and goes totally to the VA.” P8_

  - _“Well, we have some legions, some local legions, and I've been in there. But I'm like, how are these folks supposed to help me? It's just like a bar restaurant kind of thing where I am, so I don't know. I don't know. My mom was saying, well, I can help you. But no, she never helped me. So I was like, you know what. So I can just get with the ball rolling.” P10_

  - _“I'm on some Facebook group pages, or whatever Facebook pages for veterans and their claims and all that, and someone on there said that they had success with this particular attorney. So I reached out to them and went from there. Or reached out to the attorney on the recommendation of this stranger on Facebook.” P10_

  - _“Not really other than the fact that my mom asked me if I filed, and I said yes, and I told her I wasn’t going to use an attorney. She said, no, don't do that. But unbeknownst to her, I did do that. I did use an attorney. So yeah, it's something I don't wanna broadcast because it's kind of frowned upon. You see, so many people. No, don't pay anybody to do your thing. Do it yourself. whatever they say. So I'm like, I don't tell anybody. I don't broadcast that I got an attorney.” P10_

  - _“I actually looked at something online. They wanted more. They wanted the money to help. So I was like, you know, that wasn't something I wanted to look deeper into because of the financial costs. But I was trying to find someone to help me, you know, get back into this. But I just had. I just kind of gave up at that point to see the outside source would have been.” P11_

  - _“Because when I was looking at, I think the information probably didn't jump out at me. So that's probably why I didn't look into it further. Of course, I was just looking at using the claim status there, cause that's where you see your status. So I was just looking more so there, and I didn't even go about looking other, you know, to say, Hey, if there's help, and I don't think I saw anything additional information to see it unless I just missed it. But I didn't see any, you know, like you're saying that support contact, or Hey, this is where you can help. But I may. It may have been there. I just was probably more so looking at the status when I started it, and I didn't even look outside of it like said, I just kinda gave up.” P11_


### Key Finding 3

**Communication preferences vary person to person and situation to situation.**

- In person meetings continued to come up with Veterans who want to create a personal connection and build trust in the representative and processes.

- While others had no preference, they just wanted help, and kept reaching out through any means necessary.

  - When some Veterans heard nothing back, they self-filed, and were denied their claims. (P5,P11)

- Email was also brought up as a common way to connect in off-hours when no other option was available. 

- _Quotes_

  - _“Because I met with her once before, face to face, and it just seemed more personal rather than quote unquote business on the telephone. It seemed like she cared, it didn't seem to me like you know. She wanted to hit a grand slam for me, and promised the world she wanted to do what was right, and I told her that's all I wanted to do. So you know, I thought that was good. She helped me fill out some papers. You know, and told me to contact her again if I had questions or needed additional assistance, and I just felt that the personal discussion I had before went very well and I trusted her. And I thought that would be better than taking up her time on the telephone.” P1_

  - _“So that's how it started. So then I tried to contact the county office, but I could not. I couldn't get them to contact me back at all. I left messages. All kinds of things never got a response. Then I called them literally the week before Christmas. and they answered on the second ring, and I was totally shocked.” P4_

  - _“Not during business hours? It'd be nice to send off email cause remembering the call is a big. It's a big thing for me, and especially during business hours. It seems like I always remember things that I've forgotten after business hours, or I forgot to call. You know. I could send an email at that point then.” P5_

  - _“I yeah, I prefer like I would prefer, just because ultimately, I'm forking over my personal data with like social security number, medical history, all of that stuff to someone who is nominally a stranger. They're highly recommended by my coworkers, but I also wouldn't trust my coworkers with my HIPAA. So I want to meet somebody, and sort of. Just feel it out and make sure it's legit. Maybe get a business card before I just, you know, provide ever someone, all of the tools for identity theft that makes sense. It's a little bit of a hesitation. But that was my rationale. I was like before. I'm gonna like, send, you know. I think all of my medical records from the Air Force Top out at about 967 MB as a zip before sending somebody. All of that. I just kind of wanna make sure this person nominally feels trustworthy.” P7_

  - _“You know I got. I very quickly got a letter from the VA. Saying that we've received your intent to file, and then, like a day later, might have even been the same day. Just because the way the mail runs. I got something saying we've received your claim. So that was nice, cause I wasn't sure. Actually, if there was anything else I was supposed to do with the attorney cause I didn't really tell them anything.” P10_

  - _“I was declined in the original decision that I've made. So that was the only claim that I had made, and it was declined.” P11_


### Key Finding 4

**Veterans continue to have questions and lack awareness of VA accredited representatives and associated processes, impacting their ability to get timely support and benefits.**

1. Most didn’t know what a representative does, the difference between a VSO or attorney, and which option was best for their situation. (P1, P2, P8)

   1. All but one participant referenced VSOs as Officers, not Organizations.

   2. For one Veteran, variations in state names and processes for VSOs led to confusion and frustration.

      1. Scenario: Ohio’s Veteran Service Commission are VSO members, but are not accredited representatives. Veteran was adamant they had never worked with a VSO, but clearly had. (P8)

   3. One Veteran was working with a VSO and thought they were a claims agent. (P11)

2. **Most participants were unaware they were being supported by a VSO until later in their claims process, and/or assumed they were ‘assigned’ a VSO by VA. Leading many to believe they had no options to change representation, even when not receiving support. This led to self filing, claim delays, paid option considerations, and sometimes denials. (P2, P4, P8, P10, P11)**

3. One participant was unsure if asking for assistance would negatively impact their claim, so they didn’t ask for help. (P1)

4. One participant were unsure if they had to meet in person, and were unable to do so, delaying their search for representation. (P4)

**21-22 Specific**

5. Almost all participants were unaware how power of attorney (21-22/21-22a) works, or the impacts of completing the form. (P2, P4, P5, P7, P8, P10)

6. _Quotes_

   1. _“I don't know you. You know I don't know the pros and cons of just going to a local VSO. Or, you know, getting an attorney or using an organization that walks you through the process! … You might say I II wasn't looking for anything, and didn't even realize that I was entitled to anything. So you know, in my case, everything was new to me. That was pointed out to me actually, by the VA. My entitlements rather than me going to them initially. So, you know, somebody who is looking to do something and has an understanding would be more versed in and knowing how to utilize this somebody who is entitled, but has no clue that they even are entitled, or what to do. That would be the first step, you know. I never got to VA.gov looking for something. I got there because I was told that I'm entitled to benefits and here's what I need to do to secure some of them.” P1_

   2. _“So I guess if I've been assigned, I should be familiar with this place. If I'm not, and I haven't worked with them before. I don't know. I guess I'd be a little confused like who assigned me this. Why was I assigned? But assuming I had yeah, I could give them a call. I guess.” P2_

   3. _“So I don't recall selecting one. But I actually am listed for the American Legion as my current representative. Exactly. So. That's why I'm saying that's good. If you didn't know who your person was, II don't remember selecting a representative.” P4_

   4. _“Yeah, I didn't even realize we needed to, formally. you know. Appoint somebody … Just didn't realize it needed to happen.” P5_

   5. _“That's just where it came from. When I did my first filing. I had no idea that the DAV. Was even involved. I thought that it was just the Veteran Service Commission.” P8_

   6. _“Let's get away from the DAV. And I'm not being smart about that. There's no interaction with the DAV anymore. In fact. over the last couple of years regarding any claim. Only once did I have interaction with the DAV, and it was called to find out if they knew what the disposition was as to date for a specific claim, because I could not get that information online. And they were able to tell me that it was in process. That's that, was it. Aside from that, I have not had any communication with DAV aside from them, providing me information specific to a claim after it's been approved or disapproved.” P8_

   7. _“That was automated from what it looked like. It was more so based, you know, that was not my decision \[to select my representative]. So it was VA, that had, you know, provided that person. So yeah, I don't. I didn't have any interaction with that._

_Janelle: Okay, so they were in the Va hospital._

_Yes, yes. So they yeah. Well, actually the claims agent. They were most off site, and, you know, kind of remote. But I didn't have to. I wasn't the one that picked them, in a sense.” P11_


### Key Finding 5

**Continue to hear a high desirability for the _Find a Representative_ feature, but awareness of options outside of healthcare or claims on VA.gov could limit Veterans ability to find the feature.**

1. All Veterans had not considered VA.gov to manage their representative because they were unaware it existed.

2. Veterans are looking for a trusted registry to reference when looking for representatives. (P7, P11)

3. One participant mentioned they like digital forms to remove chances of error on the forms themselves. (P4)

4. Saw challenges with Appoint a Representative adoption due to lack of digital submission options. (See Task 5)

5. Quotes

   1. _“I didn't, you know. Honest, I didn't even know that I was able to to go on through VA.gov and and and get options that way. Okay, I was not aware of that.” P1_

   2. _“My brain kind of feels like if they were like a registry of like trusted agents for something like this, and I don't know if such a thing exists. If it does, I'm very embarrassed. … And they have been vetted or trusted, you know, like they're, you know, nominally on a database some somewhere, and, like that, would inspire some more feelings of confidence on my part rather than just like for me, I'm still doing a little bit of due diligence with this opaque agent that that's based out of \[city]. My father, also a Veteran, much more skeptical. No, he wants to see like a blue check or a green check next to somebody's name before he will even call them so like, that's just sort of like an idea that's been bouncing around the back of my brain. But that's probably outside of the scope of this project.” P7_

   3. _“No, I didn't. I guess I didn't realize that they had that available like I mean, it makes sense that they would, but I just didn't think oh, let me check the VA. Web site, for you know, or it might have, and it might have said, “Find a VSO in your area”, or something it could have. I don't really remember.” P10_

   4. _“It would be very likely for me, honest because I would want to find. Maybe I moved. And you know I had to find another person to contact, and I wouldn't want to find somebody in my area to help. Or if there are other options, if I'm navigating the, you know, help that I need. Maybe I want to find somebody else. That would be very, very reluctant to find that information. I do it all the time when I'm doing different searches and things and things like that. So I wanna make sure I have all the information.” P11_


## Tasks and Conclusions<a id="tasks-and-conclusions"></a>

### Task 1 / Veteran expectations and understanding of the landing page and next steps.

1. Most feedback was around understanding VA processes.

   1. Even when participants had questions, most still saw the steps, and associated them with an order of ‘find’ then ‘appoint’ a representative.

   2. The number one question being ‘What’s the difference between representatives and which option is best for me?’

      1. _Note: When participants landed on this page they lingered at the top looking for this information. It felt as though they were looking for an additional step before ‘Find’ and ‘Appoint’ that would explain the process in full before continuing._

      2. _“I wish there was somewhere on here that maybe said, like told you what the difference is between an accredited attorney or a VSO. Like that's great. Y'all are helping me find one. But which one do I want based on. I don't know whatever my needs are, I guess, but like what's the difference between the 2? Aside from, I guess, an attorney you have to pay, but I mean but like if I didn't know which was which I don't know, so that might have been helpful to have maybe a link, another link. What's the difference? Which one do I want? I don't know.” P10_

   3. Other notable questions included;

      1. If I assign a new representative do I now have two assigned to me? (P2)

      2. What situations would I want to replace my representative? (P4)

      3. Why aren’t the 21-22 and 21-22a a single form? (P4)

      4. If you self-filed, does your claim transfer to your representative when you appoint them? (P7)

      5. Is this form a power of attorney? (P10)

2. Some participants felt that the page had too much information, and were looking for a better hierarchy to determine what was important on the page.

   1. _“Okay, I think that that is one of the issues that that I ran into is just there's, sometimes information overload. And so being able to mentally just block out what is easily identified is not important or not relevant so that it can focus on what is.” P2_

3. A participant mentioned that seeing attorneys on VA.gov boosted their confidence in their decision when historically they had been told it was wrong by peers.

4. A participant called out that they had ‘seen this page before’ on VA.gov.


### Task 2 / Show how you would sign-in to see your representative information.

1. Almost all participants were able to find and sign-in to see their representative.

   1. One participant went to claims expecting to see their representative there.

2. The biggest question around the widget was; _what if someone is representing me and I didn’t realize it? Whether because I forgot or because they were assigned to me (by VA) and I didn’t know\._

   1. _“So I don't recall selecting one. But I actually am listed for the American Legion as my current representative. Exactly. So. That's why I'm saying that's good. If you didn't know who your person was, II don't remember selecting a representative.” P4_

   2. _“Well, I mean like. I mean, there are like long wait times right in between from when we file our claims, and then, when you hear something, so I might have forgotten or not me necessarily. But I could have a lot of things going on, and I'm dealing with a lot of different attorneys, or just you know, organizations who knows? So I'm like, I don't know. Did I sign up for that? I mean, because my sign up process was very they didn't ask me any questions. Really, it was just, you're a Veteran. You want to file a claim? Okay, we'll sign this power of attorney, and we'll get it, rollin’, and that was pretty much it. I think I did get a letter at some point that was from the VA. It wasn't even from them that was from the VA. So you know, depending on what a person's got going on that you might not have realized. Oh, this! These are the folks representing me, for I don't know.” P10_

3. Most participants found the card information to be good, but some were looking for additional information such as;

   1. Representatives email address. (P5, P10, P11)

   2. A way to export the contact information to their phone. (P7, P11)

   3. Office website. (P7)

   4. Office hours. (P7)

   5. Fax number. (P7)

      1. _“Well, that's always good, because trying to use stickies or pieces of paper, you know, just to keep track of things. Which I know doesn’t work for me, but I still try and still do it. And yeah, it’d be nice to have it there.” P5_

      2. _“If there was a way to export this information immediately to a contact in my phone. That would be great. If you, regardless of what kind of machine you're on Microsoft or Apple and it would be able to go directly into your address book, which, if it's synced to a cloud like it. Just yeah, especially if it's on a phone. That's a dream. Because then it's just your VSO is now in your phone. Immediately, that would be great.” P7_


### Task 3 / Show where you would go to appoint a new representative.

1. No participants showed any challenges in finding the call to action on the landing page, but many did want to find a representative first.

   1. _This is a good sign that participants understood the order of tasks and would complete them prior to starting this step._

2. On the ‘Fill out your form to appoint a VA accredited representative or VSO’ page most participants were not clear on next steps, or felt the page was redundant.

   1. Many participants were looking for clearly defined steps on what to do and expect. Some directly called out wanting a numbered list. (P1, P4, P5)

   2. One thought the form titles at the top were links, and recommended removing them. (P7)

      1. _“I think this is a little confusing, at least to me. Before you fill out this form, you'll need to find an accredited representative. Then you'll need to contact them to make sure they're available after you fill out the form. You and your credit representative need to sign it. Then you need to submit it. We'll send you an email with instructions how to submit it. So I guess on the previous page I found a representative or list of representatives. And I've contacted them, or I've chosen one who could help me, and the next step is, I go to the green arrow, and I fill out the form and appoint them, in other words, fill it out with their name and respective information ... Okay, it's just I don't know. I don't know. Maybe a little clearer, clearer would be step one step, 2 step 3. You know, actually pointed out that way.” P1_

      2. _“So like the text here of appointment a veteran service organization is a claimant representative via 21-22, I don't quite see what the purpose of these, they just look like the titles of PDFs.” P7_

      3. _“Alright under, what to know before you fill out this form.  It said, you need to find the creditor representative. Wasn't that on the prior page?” P8_

3. There was no feedback on the ‘Tell us who you are’ page, and all participants selected the ‘Yes, I’m the Veteran’ radio button with no issue.


### Task 4 / Complete the 21-22 form. Provide feedback at each step.

#### Step 1 of 4 / Accredited representative information

**Representative Search**

1. When searching, half of participants went to the ‘Find an accredited representative’ link first, rather than the search box to narrow down their search. Highlighting that users expected to complete the find task first.

   1. _“If I had typed in just Veterans I would have expected a much longer list. And if I, you know, typed in Disabled American Veterans, again a longer list, unless there is something previously that I was able to narrow down to location.” P2_

   2. _“I, in this situation would have done the find look, and I would see, like the 3 options that came down like the Catholic organization, the Vfw. And then, like the the DAV, I think, is the the one that we selected and I would have called them or done some cursory research on another browser tab into those organizations, maybe ask some coworkers and then elected but and then, in addition to that, like it, the prompts came up where it was like you should call this organization, and like on a base level. Call them to see if they have the ability or the flexibility, or the manning to take another case. Yes, website, telling me to call them. No, I'm going to call them when I want to.” P7_

2. Some participants expected the search to be geolocated to their area.

3. One participant expected the search to show results inline on the page. (P4)

**Replace Current Representative**

4. There was a general expectation that when assigning a new representative that the representatives would be notified of the change.

   1. _“Oh, yes, just you know. So that's you know it has been sent to somebody, and then, you know, it's being worked, and we have the information. But then it's going to eventually alert that person. Hey? This is your claim, you know. This is the next claim that you have. This person has a lot like, you know, has notated you as a representative, or whatever, or the power of the system as so they would be able to contact as well. So again, schedules permit things like that. So everyone is pretty much this aware of what's going on so that it's not one, sided.” P11_

5. Otherwise, there were no major concerns or questions around replacing an existing representative.

**Contact the Representative**

6. Half of participants assumed they would have contacted the representative before this point and would not have started this process to begin with if they hadn’t.

   1. One participant mentioned they’d pause and call the representative at this point.

      1. _“I guess to me it would. It would make more sense, you know, if this is a I guess in my head, I'm thinking, okay, th it. It's not completely out of place, because it's more of a verification process to make sure that I don't know kind of a cover. Cover your base right? Everyone's covering their bases. Make sure that nothing gets gets dropped, so I don't think it's completely out of the blue that I would need to call them. But also I would wonder. You know, if I didn't call, or if I'm just clicking through and and click continue without verifying it? Am I just gonna a and that they were actually not able to represent me? Then? am I just gonna be sitting in limbo without knowing that I'm sitting in limbo.” P2_

      2. _“Well, see, I thought we were supposed to have already done that before we come and try to appoint them. Okay. I guess this is just them making sure in case you missed that in case, you didn't know.” P10_

      3. _Again noting that this could be a limitation of the study and where users are at in their journey with finding and working with a representative. What’s important to note is that they understood that this was a task they needed to do prior._

7. Most interpreted the replace and contact pages as confirmations that no steps were missed. Some commented that if that were the case they’d expect them to be more in their face through color or modals.

   1. _“I would have assumed that that was done with step one, and I'd be going on the step 2 but this type of information that I would think would come up on a pop up, or something, or or something kind of a wait, verify or confirm. This is the action that you're taking. I like that to make sure that you're not accidentally doing something that you didn't intend to do.” P2_


#### Step 2 of 4 / Your information

1. All participants were able to complete this portion of the task. Most commented that it was very basic information.

2. One participant was confused why personal and contact information weren’t on the same page. As well as why they had to call to edit some information and not others.


#### Step 3 of 4 / Accredited representative permissions

**Version A (proposed legal) vs version B (original legal)**

1. The proposed legal content had half the questions, concerns, and feedback than the original legal content.

2. Version B only; all participants were confused on if the checkboxes were optional or required. Half expected them to be required, the other half optional.

**Permission to access your medical records**

3. (Version A & B) No one objected to providing their medical records as the representative would need access to them in order to file their claim.

   1. _“It's not my favoriteest thing to do. But in this situation you're gonna have to. If you want the help and assistance to properly file your claim and give the information needed that will benefit you in the long run.” P4_

4. (Version A & B) Most participants questioned and were looking for more information as to why specific medical conditions were called out on the page.

   1. One participant was looking for the US Codes associated with the policies to learn more.

      1. _“Well, this page is clearly I don't understand. The one with the 4 specific medical conditions. I don't understand why you highlighted those.” P1_

**Permission to change your address**

5. (Version A & B) Every participant but one was confused why permissions to change their address was there and would not grant permissions to do so. Why?

   1. Most were uncomfortable proceeding without clearly understanding why this was being requested. (P1, P4, P7, P10)

   2. They confirmed their address on the previous page, and can update in the future on their own. (P8, P10)

   3. Assumed the change of address would send all written documentation to the representative, not them. (P2)

   4. Assumed it was confirming a previous address change from step 2. Did not notice this was permissions at all. (P5)

      1. _“Why would they need to change my address? I would get nervous about this cause, you know, for such a big system. Right? The VA, yeah. Same thing coming out of the military. It seems like the potential that your record, your information, can get either lost in the bottom of the pile somewhere or just lost in the interwebs somehow, somewhere, and you know, I guess sometimes you really have to chase down an organization and ping them to make sure that they're staying on top of your your stuff. Whatever it is, right. And I'm not talking VA, specifically. So with this I'm nervous about changing my address, because then, if I change it, and now notifications are going to, you know, presumably with this office. But who knows where notifications that I need to be doing this or that, or here's per number information that now I'm not getting it, and I don't know that I'm not getting it.  yeah, I don't. I'd be curious like, why, why would I need to change? Why would they need to change my address?” P2_

      2. _“I'm very curious as to why. I would like \[to know] why they would need the ability to change my address. But okay. I understand that I need to consent to that. I understand that they need to have like super user authorities over my profile or over my account on VA.gov. My question then becomes like, this is something that would take up with my VSO. Over like, why do you need that? I become a little skeptical? But we'll power through.” P7_

      3. _“I mean, your address is already filed with the VA. Whether it's email or whether it's your home address. I'm trying to figure out why the VSO. Or the accredited representative would need to change your address. But if you don't check it, they may not be able to help you. You know now, it seemed to me in one of the pages, it is specific to the Veteran, it had your information. I think it had the address and it had that type of thing  so that kind of makes my point that address that was I assume automatically populated is what the VA has on file I don't know, maybe I'm overthinking it. You know.” P8_


#### Step 4 of 4 / Review

1. All participants expected the ‘Print Form’ button to launch a PDF or print view of the page.

   1. _“My brain immediately assumes that this is going to bring up a print file prompt like a little like. Push the sync to your printer. I would like, I know that from that prompt that will pop up like there is the option to save as PDF. If there were an option here, export is PDF or print that would be great.” P7_

2. Some participants were confused on the ‘+’ as a way to expand the dropdowns and were looking for a caret instead.

3. Otherwise all participants were able to complete the task and continue to the next step.


### Task 5 / Veteran expectations and understanding of the review page and next steps.

1. Half of participants openly commented that the final page was not what they expected, mostly due to the expectations set by the ‘Print Form’ button, and admitted they’d probably drop off here.

   1. Some expected the flow to be a digital submit despite earlier content.

   2. One mentioned they’d drop because they don’t have a printer.

      1. _“But like just giving these options to us as far as like, okay, like, you have your finalized form. Here's what you need to do to send it to your VSO. That would be a bit more respectful. That would be a bit more like just productive. This again, like I go like my test cases like, imagine my father going through this process on VA.gov, and he's just like, no, he's checked out. He's closed the browser window. He's going back to like Farmville on Facebook, like he's mad. Which is unfortunate. He needs. He needs his disability as well. But I understand what this is doing. I just think that there's a better way to execute the jump from the last page of printing the form to this page, which is printing the form with a new set of tasks. It's just it's another fetch quest.” P7_

      2. _“I don't know to me, coming from me, who hired an attorney to avoid the hassle. This is a hassle to me, so I'm probably not gonna do it.” P10_

2. Half of our participants were looking for a way to access their document later on VA.gov. Whether in their documents or myVA.

3. The provided steps caused confusion. Some of the common topics were;

   1. Confusion  on whether they were submitting or the representative was.

      1. When asked to clarify they said they’d expect the representative to submit once they received the document.

   2. Confusion on if mail was email or snail mail.

   3. Some skipped steps 2 and 3 entirely and jumped straight from download to submit on their first read through.

      1. Moderator had to ask participants to slow down and re-read sections to get them to notice that they had to have signatures from both themselves and the representative.

         1. _“I would download my information just to make sure I have it just so that it's in my, you know, somewhere in my, you know area. And then I mean, I think, here, I just submit. Okay, so how to submit your form. So now this is … Oh, so now it gets a little like, okay, making sure that I read this because some would think that it's going to automatically be submitted. But I have to print it out and then take it in person and sign. And then the representative, actually okay, they gotta sign it. And then it has to be. So. There's a form to submit. So I guess I guess to make sure, okay, and that you have to really read this page because you will get really, you'll think that everything is done. But yeah, you have to make sure that you're looking at the last 2 items because you have to sign it and then make sure that the representative signs, and then mail your form to them, or bring it to them in person. So this is where, maybe, having that contact information would be helpful.” P11_

4. One participant was looking for representative contact information to discuss next steps.

**Previous 21-22 Use**

1. Three participants remembered working with a representative previously to submit their 21-22/21-22a.

   1. One filled the form out in person with a VSO. (P1)

   2. One was told to fill out the 21-22 and return it to the VSO. (P4)

   3. One was digitally through docusign with an attorney. (P10)

2. All others did not remember filling out the form even though four of them would have had to have filled it out in order to work with their representative (VSO). Other than P7 who had not started working with a representative yet.


## Additional Insights<a id="additional-insights"></a>

None


## Recommendations<a id="recommendations"></a>

### Disruptive to Task Completion

1. **On the landing page, how might we inform Veterans about what representatives do, their differences, and the processes surrounding them?**

   1. Team ideas included;

      1. Numbered process list.

      2. Additional info components.

      3. Have a step before the Find a Rep CTA that links to the FAQ.

2. **On the widget, how might we address Veterans unawareness that VA does NOT assign representatives and / or are confused why a representative’s there?**

   1. Top team idea is to place a disclaimer in widget linking to an FAQ.

   2. Lindsay to add the topic to the call center guide.

3. **On the permissions pages, how might we provide additional context to help users understand the legal purpose of permissions?**

   1. Top team idea is to work with CAIA to find an eloquent way to provide legal reasons to Veterans.

      1. Confirm wording with stakeholders.

4. **How might we decrease drop-off on the review and final page by addressing non-digital submissions and improving user guidance?**

   1. Top team ideas included;

      1. More clearly setting expectations earlier in the process, especially on the ‘Fill out your form …’ page.

      2. Swap the ‘Print Form’ button to ‘Download’, ‘Generate Form’, or another standard confirmation page option.

      3. Combine steps to be 1/ Print and sign and 2/ Representative sign and submit.

         1. With optional information on how to submit if your representative cannot do so.


### Nice to Have

5. **What additional information can we provide to users to help them contact their representative easier?**

   1. Current state will add email to the widget.

   2. Future state;

      1. Potential to share or download the contact.

      2. Have a details page that contains more information that users can bookmark.

6. **On the ‘Select the accredited representative page’, how might we better set expectations on how the search box works?**

   1. Team ideas included;

      1. Moving the ‘Find a Rep’ link under the search box.

      2. Clarify that VSO is a Veteran Service Officer, so it’s clear the users have to search for a name.

   2. Future idea; Provide representatives with referral links, so no need to search. If a user is signed in and uses a link they can complete 21-22 in a few clicks.

7. **On the Select and Contact the representative pages, how might we emphasize that the steps are confirmations, not actions?**


### Cross Team Collaboration Opportunities

8. **The proposed plain language summary of legal content outperformed the original legal content. Team recommends implementing the proposed option.**

   1. Work with Kayce to confirm proposed legal treatment.

9. **On the final page, how might we provide a clear way for the user to access their 21-22 later?**

   1. Work with MyVA and Profile to confirm placement of representative information and 21-22 document locations. 


## Next Steps<a id="next-steps"></a>

1. Work with CAIA to update content and designs.

2. Test Appoint a Representative unauthenticated flow with the top four recommendations.
