# Research Plan for ARM Team, Authenticated Appoint a Representative Form User Test, 01/2024<a id="research-plan-for-arm-team-authenticated-appoint-a-representative-form-user-test-012024"></a>

## Background<a id="background"></a>

The Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) is seeking to migrate Veteran and Power of Attorney (PoA) experiences from the legacy Stakeholder Enterprise Platform (SEP) product and eBenefits platform to VA.gov.

The primary goal is to make it easier, safer, and faster for Veterans to assign and manage Power of Attorney (PoA), and explore new ways that VA.gov can better support Veterans who choose to interact with VA through a representative.

### OCTO Priorities<a id="octo-priorities"></a>

- **Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience**: team is developing a widget to provide authenticated Veterans clear insight into existing representation as well as a simplified experience for digitally submitting a request for representation using their information on file.

- **Fast-track disability claims, starting with PACT Act claims**: many Veterans who are applying for disability benefits are working with representatives; our product will help these Veterans understand and manage their representation on VA.gov.

### Veteran Journey<a id="veteran-journey"></a>

Veterans can get the help of a representative at any point in the journey where they are submitting benefits. Such as; starting up, taking care of myself, retiring, and aging.

Full [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) for reference.


## Research Goals<a id="research-goals"></a>

- Understand Veterans' motivations for seeking representation, why they selected their representative, and what that experience has been like.

- Understand usability of the authenticated Appoint a Representative flow (21-22/21-22a form) on both desktop and mobile devices.


### Outcome<a id="outcome"></a>

- Information on Veterans’ motivations and behaviors surrounding representatives will inform the MVP and future experiences.

- User testing will inform adjustments to the 21-22(a) form flows to improve usability.


### Research questions<a id="research-questions"></a>

1. What prompts Veterans to find representation?

2. What has the Veterans’ experience been with their representatives?

3. Do Veterans’ understand the information shown? Is there any information missing?

4. What are Veterans’ expectations of the experience?

5. Are there any challenges with using the experience?

6. Are the next steps clear and actionable?


### Hypothesis<a id="hypothesis"></a>

1. Veterans understand a representative's abilities, and proactively seek their support.

2. Veterans’ have criteria when searching for a representative to ensure they meet their needs.

3. Veterans will prefer to sign-in to simplify the form experience and save their progress.

4. Veterans will want to provide full access to their information to their representatives so they can better support them.

5. Veterans will prefer plain language legal copy, as it will be easier to understand.

6. Veterans will prefer to use the online form to fill out the 21-22(a) in order to reduce error, rather than downloading and filling out on their own.


## Methodology<a id="methodology"></a>

**Semi-structured interview** / The interviewer will ask the Veterans a series of questions to learn about their representative selection process and engagement with their representative.

**Usability testing** / Veterans will be asked to engage with a live prototype to test usability, understandability of content, and desirability of features.
