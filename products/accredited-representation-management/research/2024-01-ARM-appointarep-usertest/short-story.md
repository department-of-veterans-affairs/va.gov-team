# Veterans Seek Clarity and Confidence in Appointing Representatives

*Insights from the Authenticated Appoint a Representative Form User Test (Jan 2024)*

## tl;dr

Veterans want help navigating the claims process but face confusion and barriers in finding, understanding, and appointing representatives online.

## What we did

This study was conducted by the OCTO-DE Accredited Representative Management Team. Researchers used semi-structured interviews and usability testing with 8 Veterans to understand motivations for seeking representation, usability of the authenticated Appoint a Representative flow (21-22/21-22a form), and areas for improvement on both desktop and mobile.

## Key insights

- **Veterans value expert help but have varied needs.**
  - *“Don’t know the process, so they rely on experts to file quickly and lessen the chance of filing improperly.”* (Line 116)
- **Peer referrals and online searches drive representative selection.**
  - *“Peer referrals and online searches continue to be Veteran’s go to when searching for a representative to support them.”* (Line 101)
- **Confusion about the process and roles is common.**
  - *“Most didn’t know what a representative does, the difference between a VSO or attorney, and which option was best for their situation.”* (Line 237)
- **Digital features are desired, but awareness is low.**
  - *“All Veterans had not considered VA.gov to manage their representative because they were unaware it existed.”* (Line 282)
- **Unclear permissions and process steps disrupt completion.**
  - *“Every participant but one was confused why permissions to change their address was there and would not grant permissions to do so.”* (Line 456)

## Between the lines

Despite a strong desire for expert assistance, Veterans are often left to self-navigate a complex, bureaucratic process. Lack of clear, accessible information—especially about the differences between representatives—creates hesitation and confusion. Digital solutions are welcomed, but poor discoverability and unclear steps create drop-offs.

## Yes, but

This research focused on a small, specific group and may not fully represent underserved populations, such as Veterans using assistive technology or from diverse backgrounds. Future studies should include these voices to ensure solutions are inclusive.

## Why it matters

Improving the representative appointment experience directly supports VA’s mission to deliver better, faster benefits to Veterans and aligns with OCTO KRs around digital access, user satisfaction, and reducing unnecessary barriers.

## What’s next

- Update content and designs to clarify representative roles and permissions.
- Test the unauthenticated flow and address top usability barriers.
- Collaborate on technical solutions to increase awareness and streamline digital submissions.
