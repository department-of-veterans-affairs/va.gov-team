# Veterans' Journey to Finding Representation: Insights from User Testing

*Find a Representative User Test Research Findings, 12/2023*

## tl;dr
Veterans face challenges navigating representation options on VA.gov, but integrating better tools and language could transform their experience.

## What we did
The Accredited Representation Management Team at OCTO conducted semi-structured interviews and usability tests to understand Veterans' motivations, behaviors, and challenges when seeking representation and using the "Find a Representative" tool on VA.gov.

## Key insights
- **Veterans prioritize fast and thorough claim support** ([Line 106](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/accredited-representation-management/research/2023-11-ARM-findarep-nav-usertest/research-findings.md#L106)).  
  - Quote: “Us guys from Vietnam, we’re being overlooked. I understand with the PACT act we qualify with agent orange. That’s been hard to prove. It’s been frustrating.”  
- **Trust in representatives is crucial, often built through peer referrals** ([Line 143](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/accredited-representation-management/research/2023-11-ARM-findarep-nav-usertest/research-findings.md#L143)).  
  - Quote: “I’ve just been reaching out to all my connections through our old unit. We belong to an association. We got about 6,000 members.”  
- **In-person support builds trust but isn’t always accessible** ([Line 176](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/accredited-representation-management/research/2023-11-ARM-findarep-nav-usertest/research-findings.md#L176)).  
  - Quote: “People are less apt to lie to you, or swindle you, if they can look you in the eye, or you can look them in the eye.”  
- **Terminology confusion limits usability** ([Line 187](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/accredited-representation-management/research/2023-11-ARM-findarep-nav-usertest/research-findings.md#L187)).  
  - Quote: “I don’t think a VSO and an accredited representative are the same thing.”  
- **Veterans were eager to use the tool after seeing it in action** ([Line 238](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/accredited-representation-management/research/2023-11-ARM-findarep-nav-usertest/research-findings.md#L238)).  
  - Quote: “If they were vetted attorneys, I'd absolutely use it.”

## Between the lines
Veterans navigating VA.gov face systemic trust issues and terminology barriers. Building clearer pathways and integrating relatable language fosters trust and adoption.

## Yes, but
While VA.gov tools inspire confidence post-exposure, initial lack of awareness and usability hurdles deter Veterans from exploring these resources independently.

## Why it matters
This research aligns with OCTO’s mission to streamline Veteran experiences, reduce reliance on legacy systems, and foster trust through reliable, user-centered tools.

## What’s next
- Improve tool discoverability via homepage placement and search optimization.
- Simplify terminology to align with Veterans' language (e.g., emphasizing "VSO").
- Enhance data transparency, include ratings for representatives, and consider expanding search radius for rural users.
