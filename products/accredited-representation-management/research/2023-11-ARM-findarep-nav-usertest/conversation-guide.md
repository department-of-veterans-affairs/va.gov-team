## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Janelle and I’m a researcher working on improving VA.gov so Veterans can get the support they need. [NAME] will be joining us to take notes.

Before we get started a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about an hour.**
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions to improve digital tools that better meet Veterans needs.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback. I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation is completely voluntary.** If for any reason you want to stop, or do not want to answer a question, please let me know. You'll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete today.
- **During today's interview, we may discuss experiences that have caused serious frustration.** I do want to know about those experiences in case there are processes we can improve in the future, but they are not experiences I can help with directly. I don’t have any connection to your benefits or those that support you, nor do I have access to your records and wanted to provide that transparency up front.
- **Knowing this, I have [#] teammates who would like to observe our session, but only if you're comfortable.** Would that be okay, or do you prefer to keep the session to just the three of us?
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers.
   - Then, ask the observer(s) to give a brief, camera-on introduction, first name and position with VA.gov.
   - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observer(s) to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth.
- **Are you ok if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and your comments will stay anonymous.
   - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

_Start recording._

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Do I have permission to record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
