# Research Plan for ARM Team, Find a Representative User Test, 11/2023

## Background
The Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) is seeking to migrate Veteran and Power of Attorney (PoA) experiences from the legacy Stakeholder Enterprise Platform (SEP) product and eBenefits platform to VA.gov.

The primary goal is to make it easier, safer, and faster for Veterans to assign and manage Power of Attorney (PoA), and explore new ways that VA.gov can better support Veterans who choose to interact with VA through a representative.

### [OCTO Priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202023.md)
- **Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience:** team is developing a widget to provide authenticated Veterans clear insight into existing representation as well as a simplified experience for digitally submitting a request for representation using their information on file.
- **Fast-track disability claims, starting with PACT Act claims:** many Veterans who are applying for disability benefits are working with representatives; our product will help these Veterans understand and manage their representation on VA.gov.

### [Veteran Journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)
This work touches on various aspects of the Veteran Journey. Whenever a Veteran could potentially need help from a representative this feature would be relevant. For many Veterans, this can happen at any point along their life journey.

## Research Goals	
Understand how users navigate to and use the find a representative tool on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Outcome
User testing will inform navigation to and usability of the find a representative tool.

### Research questions
Please refer to the [conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/accredited-representation-management/research/2023-11-ARM-findarep-nav-usertest/conversation-guide.md) for all participant questions.
1. When would Veterans’ engage with the find a representative experience?
2. Where would they expect to find this experience on VA.gov?
3. Do Veterans’ understand the information shown? Is there any information missing?
4. What are Veterans’ expectations of the experience?
5. Are there any challenges with using the experience?
6. Are the next steps clear and actionable?

### Hypothesis
1. Veterans will associate finding a representative with the benefit they’re wanting support with.
2. By providing information in plain language, Veterans’ will understand representatives, and the processes to manage them.
3. A representative's location is important to Veterans so they can easily see their representative in person.
4. Veterans will prefer to sign-in to see their current representative.

## Methodology	
**Usability testing** / Veterans will be asked to engage with VA.gov and a prototype to test usability, understandability of content, and desirability of features.

### Location
Remote on Zoom
