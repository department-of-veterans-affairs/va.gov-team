# Research Goals<a id="research-goals"></a>

## Veteran Journey

Veterans can get the help of a representative at any point in the journey where they are submitting benefits. Such as; starting up, taking care of myself, retiring, and aging.

[Full Veteran journey for reference.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)


## Goals
- Understand how Veterans search, select, and expect to work with a representative.
- Evaluate if changes to Find a Representative address previous research findings.
- Evaluate if adding in digital submit and design changes to Find and Appoint a Representative, cause any usability challenges with participants.


## Outcome
- Information on how Veterans search, find, and want to work with a representative will provide input on how Find and Appoint work together.
- User testing will inform adjustments to the Find and Appoint a Representative flows (21-22 form only) to improve usability.


# Research Questions<a id="research-questions"></a>
- What methods do Veterans use today to find representation?
- Are we hearing the same feedback from Veterans after Find a Representative updates?
- Do Veterans see themselves using Find and Appoint together as a process?
- Are there any usability challenges with the Find and Appoint user flows?
  - Do participants understand the information shown?
  - Are there any challenges with using the experience?
  - Are the next steps clear and actionable?


# Methodology<a id="methodology"></a>
- **Warm-up questions /** The moderator will ask the Veteran a short series of questions to understand their current status with finding a representative and VA.gov engagement.
- **Usability testing** / Participants will be asked to engage with a prototype to test usability, understandability of content, and desirability of features.


## Meet our Participants

### Previous Representation
- 2 participants had never worked with a representative before. (P3, P9)
- 3 participants had worked with a representative in the last 5 years. (P2, P7, P10)
  - 1 was changing because their representative only helps with disability benefits, and they need help with education benefits. (P2)
  - 1 was changing due to lower than anticipated benefits, but had positive comments about their representative experience. (P7)
  - 1 was changing representatives due to lack of previous support. (P10)
- 2 participants had worked with 2+ representatives in the last 5 years. Both were changing representatives due to lack of previous support. (P4, P6)


### Search Methods
- 4 participants were searching through their local VA facility. (P7, P10)
- 4 participants were using online resources.
- 3 participants were searching through peers.


### VA.gov Use
- All participants used VA.gov for healthcare purposes.
- 3 participants used VA.gov for additional services such as letters and claims.
- 2 participants noted that they have difficulty using VA digital experiences. (P7, P10)


### VA.gov Consideration
- 4 participants had used VA.gov (either eBenefits, OGC, or Find a Representative).
  - 1 participant attempted to use Find a Representative, but stopped after realizing the contact information was out of date.
  - 1 tried VA.gov but gave up. (P7)
- 2 participants were considering using VA.gov.
- 1 participants had never considered VA.gov as an option. (P10)


# Tasks and Conclusions<a id="tasks-and-conclusions"></a>
1. **Adoption**: Would participants use the Find and Appoint a Representative tools?
   1. **üí°Conclusion**: Participants were split on whether or not they‚Äôd adopt the tools, which led us to defining new audiences for ARM.
2. **Task 1**: Review and provide feedback on Find a Representative experience, focusing on new features and functionality.
   1. [üö´](https://emojipedia.org/prohibited) **Conclusion**: Changes in content, addition of the VSO filter, and digital submit caused participants new challenges we have not previously seen on Find a Representative. Recommend revisiting new content and features.
3. **Task 2**: Complete Appoint a Representative (21-22 form) and provide feedback on the experience.
   1. [‚ö†Ô∏è](https://emojipedia.org/warning) **Conclusion**: The form tested well with participants, other than the concepts of digital submit, organization selection, and missing context of VA forms and processes. Recommend adding in additional context of VA forms and processes, along with any learnings from FAR V3 testing.


# Details of Findings<a id="details-of-findings"></a>

## Key
‚úÖ No challenges completing the task.
[‚ö†Ô∏è](https://emojipedia.org/warning) Caused some hesitation or questions but didn‚Äôt stop task completion.
[üö´](https://emojipedia.org/prohibited) Unable to complete task without help/would abandon flow.


## Adoption: Would participants use the Find and Appoint a Representative tools?

**üí°Conclusion**: Participants were split on whether or not they‚Äôd adopt the tools, which led us to defining new audiences for ARM.

This was our first time testing Find and Appoint a Representative side by side. Which led to new findings on how participants saw the two products working in tandem, and whether they‚Äôd adopt one or the other.

- 3 participants commented that they‚Äôd want to use both tools.
  - These participants were comfortable with exploring VA processes, and use VA digital healthcare tools.
  - > _‚ÄúIt's pretty, it's very self-explanatory. If you can read it without difficulty, see it or have someone describe it for you, your vision's off a little bit. It looks really simple.‚Äù P3_

- 2 participants commented they would not use Find a Representative (FAR), but would use Appoint a Representative.
  - Primary reason they did not want to use FAR was due to previous bad experiences with data on VA.gov, or preferring alternative search methods such as Google.
  - > _‚ÄúSame, but I, no, for me, I've called and tried to email and nothing works. So maybe not on your end, but just, you know, in general. Yeah.‚Äù Does that sway your use of the tool or the trust, the data there? ‚ÄúYes, it does. So for me, again, I can't speak for everyone. Right. But for me, like I legit can see like, oh one 800, blah, blah, blah, right? But I will call and make sure that I'm like calling the right person, but it doesn't always work that way. So, yeah.‚Äù P2_
  - > _‚ÄúOkay. So you're assuming I'm gonna come into this as opposed to just Google VA in my county or maybe that's how I get here.‚Äù Is that how you normally would start searching? Is you'd go to Google and search for VA In my county? ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù P4_

- 2 participants commented that they would not use either tool.
  - These participants were not comfortable with VA processes and digital tools, and prefer in-person interactions.
  - > _‚ÄúI don't know if it's just me, but I get a little exasperated over the processes of getting through and then trying to navigate around. So I guess it would go back to computer skills, etcetera. You know, and I, I, I'm not familiar with any trainings to get to, for someone in the VA elderly to use their site, you know, use like something like va.gov. I mean, I the, I'm gonna put it to you straight. Young people like yourself that basically were born into a computer world. I have a skill set that is hard for someone my age to deal with. We don't have it. It's never coming. You know, I mean, I come from the era of the first telephones, etcetera. You know what I mean? It's it's a different ball game today. So it's harder for me to get in and use a site rather than me walking in shaking hands with a representative and say, OK, yeah, this is my story. What are you going to do with it or what can you do with it, I guess.‚Äù P7_
  - > _‚ÄúA lot of us older veterans, you know, we're not computer literate. You know, I'm somewhat literate. But anytime I see something, you know, like this, it, it just comes up as an obstacle to me that I get frustrated with and I don't pursue it. You know, that's why I prefer in person appointments. You go in, you hand them the form, they scan it and upload it. You don't have to do it, you know? ‚Ä¶ That's this, this doesn't help the older veteran, in my opinion.‚Äù P10_


## Task 1: Review and provide feedback on Find a Representative experience, focusing on new features and functionality.
[üö´](https://emojipedia.org/prohibited) **Conclusion**: Changes in content, addition of the VSO filter, and digital submit caused participants new challenges we have not previously seen on Find a Representative. Recommend revisiting new content and features.

**General Findings**
- Increase of content and new concepts lead to lower participant understanding and interaction with the Find a Representative tool.
- Participants who were confidently incorrect in their understanding of VA processes and terms had increased confusion when engaging with the tool. Common misconceptions included:
  - Existence of multiple types of VSOs, including VA VSOs, which are typically associated with VA facilities or those with VA.gov emails.
    - Or there are a limited number of VSOs (typically including DAV, AL, and VFW) so VSOs such as American Red Cross cause pause and suspicion.
  - VSORs can exist without a VSO.
    - Or VSORs can only associate with a single VSO.
  - VSOs are individual people, not organizations.

- Common misconception quotes:
  - > _I'm just curious, what does VSO mean to you? ‚ÄúWhat it means to me is that it's someone that's willing to help a veteran who's willing to assist with things that most veterans might not know about when you get out of the service, if you're not aware of benefits, things you can have or if you need assistance with a claim.‚Äù P3_
  - > _‚ÄúYou got three categories of VSOs, you got VA payroll VSOs, and then two categories of VA VSOs that don't get paid. And that would be private goodwill helpers not associated with veteran groups. And then you have some accredited by VA, then you get an accredited group under the flag of their own veterans group. Still has to be accredited by VA. Then you have the attorneys that charge for whatever they do. And they also have to be accredited by VA. So I guess there's actually four. VA payroll, nice guy, no pay, nice club, no pay, and attorneys.‚Äù P4_
  - > _‚ÄúWell, I'm interested in a claim. Why? I don't understand why I need to talk with it. Why I'd want to talk with the American Red Cross or any of them. No, I I just want something pertaining to what? Who's going to be handling my claim? I mean, I see on the Army and Navy Union. I mean, I don't know what I would do with any of that information there.‚Äù P7_

**Veterans Service Organization (VSO) Filter**
- Participants who were familiar with VSOs saw the list as a way to find VSOs they knew or to see what options were available. (P10)
- Participants who were less familiar with or had assumptions about VSOs were confused by the filter. For some, engaging with the filter gave them enough confidence to move on.
  - > _‚ÄúI don't understand why I need to talk with it. Why I'd want to talk with the American Red Cross or any of them. No, I I just want something pertaining to what? Who's going to be handling my claim? I mean, I see on the Army and Navy Union. I mean, I don't know what I would do with any of that information there.‚Äù P7_

**Representative information component**
- Most participants missed the component, and usually only engaged when prompted by the moderator. (P7)
- Some participants were confused by the content.
- While it was difficult for participants to explain specifics as to why the component was missed or confusing, there were three changes that could have altered the positive feedback we‚Äôve seen in previous studies, including:
  - Consolidating 3 components into 1
  - Changing the title of the component
  - Adding in additional complexities about fees

**Digitally Accept Form**
- Participants were split on whether they‚Äôd prefer a representative who could digitally accept the 21-22/21-22a or not.
- Some participants were confused on how digital accept worked or wanted more information on what form was being accepted.
  - > _‚ÄúDoes digital include email?‚Äù Would you expect it to include email? ‚ÄúI would think it would include email.‚Äù P6_
  - > _‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs gonna be later in the information, like, which forms do you submit? So there‚Äôs like, I guess what I would want would be a preview of like this is the form to file.‚Äù P9_
- One participant interpreted digital accept as being remote support only. (P10)

**‚ÄòReport Outdated Information‚Äô Button Updates**
- We AB tested ‚ÄòSuggest an edit‚Äô and ‚ÄòFlag incorrect information‚Äô as alternatives to ‚ÄòReport outdated information‚Äô.
  - ‚ÄòSuggest an edit‚Äô was frequently misinterpreted as a way to change the participants filter selections.
    - > _‚ÄúI would imagine that it would be like using a filter on someone else‚Äôs webpage where you were able to get more specific about what your search entailed.‚Äù P6_
  - ‚ÄòFlag incorrect information‚Äô was correctly interpreted by all participants as a way to identify outdated information.
    - > _‚ÄúI‚Äôm assuming that the flag incorrect information would allow me to click on that and say what was incorrect.‚Äù P9_
- Participants expected to be notified that their submission had been received, and an update when the information was corrected. (P10)


## Task 2: Complete Appoint a Representative (21-22 form) and provide feedback on the experience.
[‚ö†Ô∏è](https://emojipedia.org/warning) **Conclusion**: The form tested well with participants, other than the concepts of digital submit, organization selection, and missing context of VA forms and processes.

**Form Landing Page**

- Although there were some questions about the process, feedback on the form landing page was generally positive. Questions included:
  - What form am I filling out?
    - _Note: The content ‚ÄòVA Forms 21-22 and 21-22a‚Äô at the top of the page was easily missed by some participants._
  - What does the 21-22/21-22a do?
  - Why does the form require a social security number?
  - How do I submit the form after I print it out?
  - > _‚ÄúOK, so I do like that. It's very descriptive, like what what they need from you. What if you have like, you know, questions? And I like that. It's very what's the word I'm looking for simple, if that makes sense. I like that it's very simple.‚Äù P9_
  - > _‚ÄúOkay, so when you say another way, what do you mean?‚Äù What does that mean to you? Or what would you expect to do? ‚ÄúI don't know, I would just assume it meant, you know, email or fax or you know, mail. So what do y'all mean by that?‚Äù P2_

- Some participants were looking for the same contact information on the widget as they saw on Find a Representative.
- Some participants missed the call to action link, and commented that the language should be more actionable.
  - > _‚ÄúI've got feedback I, I don't know if that \[button] was the one to fill out your form.‚Äù What kind of language were you looking for when looking for the button? ‚ÄúMaybe click here to start something or start here or something of that, that nature.‚Äù P3_
- When asked what they would do if the representative didn‚Äôt accept the form digitally most participants mentioned they‚Äôd take the form to the representative in person.
  - One participant mentioned submitting through QuickSubmit.
  - One participant would not complete the form, and would go to the representative to fill it out in person.
  - > _If the representative didn't accept the form digitally, what would you expect to do from here? ‚ÄúCouple things. Since we picked the guy that was closest to me, I could take a nice walk, go to the clinic office where he is and hand in a copy or give him the original, have him make me a copy or I could just mail it in to his address so he'd get the copy information, the papers I have. So on that one I would probably walk in and say, hey, I've got my paperwork and can I get a copy of it please? So that way I know they have it because I gave it to somebody and I, I, I know who I gave it, who I gave it to.‚Äù P3_
  - > _If the representative you selected and spoke to did not accept their form digitally, what would your next steps be from here? ‚ÄúWell, I would, my first thought would be to complete the form and upload it through Access VA. Unless, unless that's part of the digital process that that can't be done?‚Äù P6_
  - > _‚ÄúI've never seen one like anything like this, but I the it's I would have to get confirmation on certain things to with them, you know, and like first thing that jumped in my face was this that they can digitally sign it. Well, I don't understand. I first, I don't know what that form would state, you know, that they would need to sign. I would think I would have to digitally sign it. ‚Ä¶ Does he have the telephone number? So there's a number there. So I could call him if I had a question.‚Äù P7_
- Almost all participants mentioned they would sign-in to save their progress of the form.

**Step 1 of 5 Accredited representative information: Select the accredited representative**
- Participants had no challenges with searching and selecting a representative from search results.
  - All participants used the ‚ÄòSelect this representative‚Äô button to continue.
- Some participants were looking for all information they had seen on Find a Representative search results, including distance, as a way to confirm they had found the right person.
  - > _‚ÄúSo for me, I would just say like just the distance wise and then going with that button.‚Äù So you wanna make sure they‚Äôre close to you? ‚ÄúOh yeah. One mile away or two miles away, you know, that kind of thing.‚Äù P2_

**Step 1 of 5 Accredited representative information: Contact the accredited representative**
- All participants understood the task and next steps.
  - > _‚ÄúMaybe it's just me, but I, I would not have selected him unless I've already contacted him and talked to him. But it's just me. I'm just doing it officially here online. Probably either because he's said, well I need you to fill out this form, you can do it electronically or do it by mail or stuck into the office.‚Äù P4_

**Step 1 of 5 Accredited representative information: Select the organization**
- Despite some hesitation in selecting an organization, most participants completed the task by defaulting to the one they were most familiar with or related to the most.
  - One participant would reach out to the representative to confirm.
  - One participant would leave the flow to research their options.
  - > _‚ÄúI'm thinking Disabled American Veterans.‚Äù Is there a reason you would select that? ‚Äú'Cause I'm disabled, OK? I, I don't what I, it's, it's what I don't see there. I don't, I don't see an organization for Vietnam Veterans, etcetera. You know what I mean? I don't anything related directly to who who I am. So in short, the Pickens will lean.‚Äù P7_
- Some commented that digital accept would sway their decision.
- Some were confused why a representative was accredited with multiple organizations.
  - > _‚ÄúI would guess this VSO representative works with some VSOs. Yeah, that's a little confusing. This Brian Daniel works with some VSOs. I thought he's the VSO or are we saying the VSO is down there in the blue? The disabled American vets VA regional office. That's not A-V-S-O-V-S-O is a person. Is that not correct? ‚Ä¶ Okay, so this guy belongs to DAV and I guess now it's letting me know, he also works digitally with not only the dis DAV but American Legion and the rest of these, I guess that's, that's my interpretation.‚Äù P4_

**Step 1 of 5 Accredited representative information: Replace your current accredited representative**
- Participants who had never had to replace a representative before were confused as to why they‚Äôd replace their representative. (P2, P10)

**Step 2 of 5 Your information**
- All participants understood the task and next steps.

**Step 3 of 5 Accredited representative authorizations: Authorization to access your medical records**
- All participants understood the task and the next steps, but questioned the relevance of the specific medical conditions mentioned.

**Step 3 of 5 Accredited representative authorizations: Authorization to change your address**
- Participants continue to be split on whether or not they‚Äôd allow the representative to manage their address.

**Step 4 of 5 Review**
- Most participants understood the task and next steps.
- One participant was unsure of the purpose of the page, and after noticing the mention of the 21-22 in the Terms & Conditions would abandon the flow. (P7)

**Step 5 of 5 Download a copy of the form for your records**
- All participants understood the task and next steps.

**You‚Äôve submitted your form to appoint the accredited representative**
- Some participants wanted to see the representative contact information.
- Participant was confused on if they were waiting on VA or the VSOR to follow-up with them, and how long it takes.
  - > _‚ÄúAll right, we're at the your submitted information. So I do have a question. It says you once you submit it, it says after receiving a form, you usually process it within a week. Is that giving the information to the VSO or what exactly do you mean by it receiving after receiving a form that they process it? Is that just putting it in the system Is that, you know, I, I don't understand what that means. I guess a little bit more on that.‚Äù How would you expect it to work? ‚ÄúI would expect that it, once I submit it within a week, I guess the processing after that week that once I go back in that that is now my legal VSO and all my forms and all my medical records would be sent to them. And to be able to review. Am I correct in that? ‚Ä¶ So it, it just to be clear, like where is it going? Is it just, I don't know, I, I think outside of the box maybe because I was a teacher before, but like I would want to, you know, OK, who is, who is it going to, is it just going to be updated in the va.gov site? Or could we just say we'll process the, your form and update your VA profile and send this forward to the VSO? You know, I think that would be a little bit clearer than, you know, where you're going and who, who, who has the next step in the process.‚Äù P9_
- Participant expected notification updates from VA about their form status.
- Participant had strong distrust in VA systems and would re-submit the form, every week, with no end in mind. (P2)


# Additional Insights<a id="additional-insights"></a>
Findings that have been previously captured, but are continuing to be brought up by Veterans have been captured in Additional Insights.


## VA.gov
- Almost all participants would sign-in upon arriving to VA.gov. No concrete reasons were provided as to why, but participants expected the system to recognize them and act accordingly. (P7, P10)
- The participant requested a suffix input be added to the form to indicate their gender, as they have a name that was traditionally male but is now commonly used for females.
- Participant abandoned the form because the unchanging status bar led them to believe there was an issue. (P7)


## Find a Representative

**Filter Feedback**
- Assumed if they were signed in their address would auto populate. (P4)
- Was confused by accredited representative name search field. (P4)
- Wanted a way to search for both attorneys and VSOs at the same time. (P9)

**Representative Information**
- Wanted representative medical specialty, such as MST or PTSD. (P9)
- Wanted accreditation status of representatives, including year last trained. (P10)
- Wanted profile and photograph of representative. (P10)


# Recommendations<a id="recommendations"></a>

## Recruitment Improvements
- Continue to use broad screener questions for Find a Representative testing.
- When testing Appoint a Representative, target Veterans who are capable and willing to fill out forms digitally and on VA.gov.¬†
- Review VEO materials on best practices, screeners, and recruitment communications for interviewing Veterans in more vulnerable groups.


## Content Guidelines

1. Provide specificity in plain language, but do not remove mention of processes or actions, examples below.
   - **21-22/21-22a Form**: Include information that the form is required for the representative to support with VA benefits.
     - **Example**: Use VA Form 21-22 or 21-22a to appoint a VA accredited VSO representative, attorney, or claims agent to support you with your VA benefits and claims.
   - **Digital appointment:** Be clear that the representative or VSO can be appointed online rather than referencing a form. If mentioning the form list the form number (21-22 or 21-22a).
     - **Example**: This accredited representative can be appointed online
     - **Example**: This VSO can be appointed in person or by mail
   - **PDF Pre-fill**: Emphasize that the form is only pre-filled, not digitally submitted, and how to submit after completion.
     - **Example**: If you‚Äôre appointing an accredited attorney, claims agent, or VSO representative that can‚Äôt digitally accept your form, you‚Äôll need to print your form at the end of our online tool and get the signature of the representative in person or by mail.
     - **Example**: Pre-fill your form to appoint an accredited representative in person or by mail

2. When discussing Veterans Service Organizations and Veterans Service Organization Representatives in the same sentence, do not use acronyms. Instead, spell out the terms or use "organization" in place of Veterans Service Organization.

3. Use VA accredited representatives for H1 titles and intros only, and accredited representatives for everything else.

4. Use [additional information components](https://design.va.gov/components/additional-info) only for non-required information. Required information should be placed on the page or in an accordion.


## Find a Representative

**General Recommendations**
- Move non-contact information for representatives into a detail page.

**Veterans Service Organization Filter**
- Place optional search filters under ‚ÄòAdditional filters' to avoid confusing users unfamiliar with representative processes.

**Representative information component**
- Bring representative definitions from FAQ to Find a Representative.
  - <https://www.va.gov/resources/va-accredited-representative-faqs/>¬†
- Move link to Veterans Service Organizations list into VSO content.
  - <https://www.va.gov/ogc/apps/accreditation/accredvso.asp>¬†

**Digitally Accept Form**
- Update content to only discuss the organization or the representative.
- Change organization list back to original design, and move whether or not the organization digitally accepts the 21-22 under dropdown or representative detail page.

**‚ÄòReport Outdated Information‚Äô Button Updates**
- Remove button for current experience. Revisit with ARF profile update project.
- Future: Move button to representative detail page.
- Future: Update selections to:
  - Incorrect contact information
    - Provide information to representatives on how to update their information.
  - Representative is no longer accredited or supporting Veterans
    - Provide open input to provide any additional information.
- Future: When a user reports incorrect information, do we want to notify them of updates if they‚Äôre signed in?


## Appoint a Representative

**Form Landing Page**
- Add in additional information about the 21-22/21-22a forms.
- Add in how to submit a form after printing out the PDF pre-fill form.
- Update call to action to be more actionable.
- Future: Provide individual VSO representative information on user widget.

**Step 1 of 5 Accredited representative information: Select the organization**
- Provide clearer content that the VSOR is a member of all listed organizations, and if they‚Äôre unsure of which organization to pick to call the representative.

**Step 1 of 5 Accredited representative information: Replace your current accredited representative**
- Provide information to the user that by doing this task they will be replacing their current representative.
  - Confirm content with stakeholders.

**You‚Äôve submitted your form to appoint the accredited representative**
- Provide representative contact information.
- Update information to explain that the representative is responsible for next steps, not VA.
- Idea: Do we limit the number of requests?


## FAQ Improvement
- Create content about what a VSO is, and the relationship between the VA and VSOs.
  - Confirm content with stakeholders.


# Next Steps<a id="next-steps"></a>

## Further Research Needed
- Recommend conducting two additional studies:
  - Research with cross accredited VSOs to understand organization assignment.
  - Research with Veterans on Find a Representative content updates.
