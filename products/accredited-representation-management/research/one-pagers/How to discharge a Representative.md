# How to discharge or remove a representative
> The following information is from a google search on 7/11/2025. This is the same level of information the user received when their search starts online. 

To remove a Veterans Service Officer (VSO) representative, a veteran can either appoint a new representative or submit a statement to the VA indicating they no longer wish to be represented by the current VSO. Appointing a new representative automatically revokes the previous one. 

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

1\. Appoint a new representative:
*   A veteran can appoint a new VSO, attorney, or claims agent by completing a new VA Form 21-22 or 21-22a.
*   Submitting the new form automatically revokes the previous representative's appointment, without needing to notify the previous VSO. 

2\. Submit a statement to the VA:
*   If a veteran wants to remove their VSO without appointing a new one, they can submit a statement (using VA Form 21-4138) to the VA stating they no longer wish to be represented by the current VSO.
*   This statement should be sent to both the VA regional office handling the claim and the VSO.
*   It is recommended to send the statement via certified mail with a return receipt to have proof of delivery.
*   A copy of the statement should be kept for the veteran's records.
*   No explanation is needed when submitting the statement to remove a VSO. 

3\. Seeking assistance:
*   It's recommended to seek guidance from another VSO or an attorney when removing or changing representatives, especially if there are active appeals.
*   Some VSOs may not take representation for claims at the Board of Veterans Appeals, so it's important to find a representative who can assist with the specific stage of the claim.

### Revocation: does a Veteran/claimant need to include any specific keywords when requesting a representative’s authorization be revoked?  And how do they contact the VA for this?
> The information below is from the slack canvas titled ARM Investigation

1.  There are no specific keyword requirements nor mandated form of communication (written or verbal) for a represented individual to expressly revoke an appointed representative in 38 C.F.R. § 14.631 or M21-1 I.i.2.A.6.. A completed VAF 21-22 or VAF 21-22a may be used to implicitly revoke an appointed representative.
2.  If someone wants to expressly revoke their representative, they can submit any type of correspondence stating they no longer want their representative to assist them. It doesn’t need to have any specific language, but we do need to be able to construe that the claimant no longer wants someone as their representative. Representation can implicitly be terminated by death of the represented individual, completion of a limited representation, or by appointing a new representative.
3.  At this time, there isn’t a required form to explicitly request termination of representation, so really any kind of correspondence is suitable for someone who would be working a claim.
4.  There is currently no “best way” for a represented individual to notify the VBA that they wish to expressly revoke an appointed representative. 
*   A represented individual may use the [1-800-827-1000](tel:18008271000) VBA hotline to notify the VBA verbally that they wish to expressly revoke an appointed representative. 
*   They may also write in on a regular piece of paper or VAF 21-4138 and mail to the Claims Intake Center, PO BOX 4444, Janesville, WI 53547, or fax the VBA at [844-531-7818](tel:8445317818) (domestic individuals) and [248-524-4260](tel:2485244260) (foreign individuals). A represented individual may also visit their local VA Regional Office’s Public Contact to notify the VA in person. [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) is an online portal in which a represented individual may upload a document stating that they wish to revoke an appointed representative. 
*   A represented individual may also use the VAF 21-22 or VAF 21-22a to implicitly revoke an appointed representative. They can upload the VAF 21-22 or VAF 21-22a document to [VA.gov](http://va.gov/), mail or fax to the Claims Intake Center, or drop the form off at their local VA Regional Office. 
5.  Correct, there is no general email option to either expressly or implicitly revoke an appointed representative. 
6.  Although an infrequent happening, if a claims processor were to reach out to a represented individual via email to clarify a claim or gather evidence for a claim, that individual may reply via email to that specific claims processor that they wish to revoke their appointed representation, either expressly with a written statement or implicitly with a completed VAF 21-22 or VAF 21-22a. While the VA would accept this option, it would be very unusual.
