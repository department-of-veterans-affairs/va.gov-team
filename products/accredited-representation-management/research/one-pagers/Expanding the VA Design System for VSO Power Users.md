\### Research Goal 

To understand the usability and accessibility needs of VSO power users interacting with the VA Design System, informing the development of efficient components that enhance workflow and ensure compliance with 508 standards. 

\### Objectives 

*   Identify usability challenges faced by VSO power users in the current interfaces. 

*   Gather feedback from VFS teams exploring non-veteran-facing solutions. 

Recent product discussions have emphasized the need to adapt and expand the VA Design System to better serve VSO power users. This report synthesizes insights from recent meetings, highlighting the importance of accessibility, usability, and collaboration in the exploratory process. 

\### Current Challenges 

1.  Accessibility Compliance: Accessibility compliance is essential for all VA software. However, there is a distinct difference between the VA\-level of accessibility and the Government\-level accessibility.  
2.  User Interface Limitations: Current non-veteran-facing interfaces require the use of more appropriate design components that take into consideration the viewport and the actions within that space. 
3.  Resource Constraints: Design and development teams may lack sufficient resources for the redesign and implementation of new components. 
4.  Stakeholder Buy-In: Gaining support from all stakeholders, including management and users, is crucial for successful implementation. 

\### Findings 

Finding #1: VADS is not geared for non-veteran-facing-users 
*   The VA Design System was developed for veteran-facing experiences. The system has been created and tested with veteran pain-points in mind, including cognitive and physical disabilities. Design considerations such as these create safe UI environments free from dark patterns, contextual pressures, or induced ux anxieties. The VADS utilizes methods and patterns that promote the veteran’s efforts to access their benefits online. 

*   The Accredited Representative Portal is a non-veteran-facing digital experience dedicated to supporting Veteran Service Organizations and their Representatives in the handling and processing of Veteran documents for access to VA benefits. The VSORs are business-oriented  professionals and therefore require a more robust product design that takes into account the dense amount of data required to effectively support veteran claims.  

Finding #2: Distinctions between veteran-facing design systems and non-veteran-facing design systems 
*   Veteran-centric vs. Broader audience 
    
*   Emphasis on trauma-informed design vs Focus on business goals and market research 
    
*   Accessibility as a core principle vs General accessibility standards 
    
Finding #3: Multiple teams expressed interest in an alternate VA-supported solution 
*   As the VA grows it’s efforts to digitize the need to support those who support the Veterans has arisen. Today, with the development of exteranl team tools, there is a clear need for an additional design system branch to support non-veteran facing VA users. One of the main concern raised numerous times is the resourcing required to develop and maintain any newly developed components. 
    

\### Recommendations for Expansion 

1.  Develop a Separate Design System for Non-Veteran-Facing Users 
Establish a Dedicated Framework: Create a design system tailored specifically for non-veteran-facing applications like the Accredited Representative Portal. This system should focus on business-oriented goals, accommodating the unique needs of VSO power users. 

2.  Prioritize User-Centric Design 
Focus on Usability and Workflow: Engage VSO power users in the design process to identify key usability challenges. Incorporate their feedback to create interfaces that facilitate efficient handling of dense data related to veteran claims. 

3.  Strengthen Stakeholder Engagement 
Foster Collaboration Across Teams: Involve all relevant stakeholders—including management, design, development, and VSO representatives—in the design and implementation process to ensure buy-in and support for the new system. 

4.  Address Resource Constraints 
Assess Resource Allocation: Conduct a thorough assessment of current resources and identify gaps in personnel or budget that may hinder the development of the new design system. Advocate for additional funding and personnel as needed. 

5.  Create a Feedback Loop for Continuous Improvement
Implement Iterative Testing: Establish mechanisms for ongoing user feedback and testing throughout the development process. This will allow for continuous refinement of the design system based on real user experiences. 

6.  Advocate for a Branch of the VA Design System 
Develop a New Branch for Non-Veteran-Facing Solutions: As the VA expands its digital capabilities, advocate for a formal branch within the VA Design System dedicated to supporting non-veteran-facing users, ensuring that their specific needs are met effectively. 

\### Conclusion 

Expanding the VA Design System to better accommodate the needs of VSO power users is essential for improving usability, accessibility, and overall efficiency. By developing a dedicated design system tailored for non-veteran-facing applications, the VA can address the unique challenges faced by Accredited Representatives in handling veteran claims. Prioritizing business goals, user-centric design, fostering collaboration among stakeholders, and addressing resource constraints will enhance the effectiveness of the new system. 

Establishing a continuous feedback loop ensures that the design remains responsive to user needs, promoting ongoing improvements. Advocating for a formal branch within the VA Design System dedicated to non-veteran-facing solutions will further solidify the VA's commitment to serving all users effectively. Together, these efforts will not only streamline processes but also empower VSO power users to provide better support for veterans seeking access to their benefits.
