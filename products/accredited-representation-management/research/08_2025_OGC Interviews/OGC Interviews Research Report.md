## Research Goals 
  
**Guiding Questions:** 

1. What are the primary obstacles and concerns experienced by applicants during the VA Form 21a accreditation process, from initial submission to final decision? 
2. How do OGC staff perceive the effectiveness of current communication and notification systems in supporting and guiding applicants through the accreditation journey? 


## Research Questions 

1. What are the key challenges and pain points that applicants face when completing the VA Form 21a to become accredited attorneys or claims agents? 
2. How do OGC staff currently communicate application status, denials, and requests for additional information to applicants, and what improvements could be made to these notification processes? 
3. What are the most common reasons for application denials or delays? 


Methodology 
Semi-structured interviews. The interviewer will ask the participants a series of questions to understand OGC’s current experiences with accepting and processing Form 21a. 

Hypotheses and Conclusions 


* Hypothesis Statement: 

Applicants and OGC staff experience significant challenges and inefficiencies with the current VA Form 21a digital accreditation process. 
    * Definitely True 
        * Manual Contact Information Updates 
            "So everything's pretty much manual, like we're the ones that update all the information..." (0:03:09) and "...we actually have to go in and change their information." (0:03:51). 
            * This indicates a high manual burden for OGC staff. 
        * Decentralized Inquiries 
            "Even though we have the mailbox and we strongly encourage people to send the information there to distribute it, a lot of times people will send to maybe the person they're familiar with... versus sending it to the mailbox..." (0:05:54). 
            * This shows a lack of a single, efficient intake point for updates. 
        * Challenges with Outdated Information 
            "I think the challenge is them not letting them, letting us know their content information change." (0:10:40) and "And I'm saying that because when we do have reason to send stuff by mail, a lot of it gets returned at certain times." (0:10:50). 
            * This directly points to the problem of inaccurate data due to representatives not providing updates. 
        * Significant Burden of Status Inquiries 
            "I respond to a tremendous amount of congressional inquiries on just status requests because those are really difficult for our paralegals to reply to because they're trying to move, you know, the backlog of cases and that everyone's writing in. Where is it now? Where, where is it now?" (0:14:50). 
            * This highlights a major inefficiency for OGC staff. 
        * Incomplete Applications 
            "...making fields required. Stuff like that is always good because I can't tell you too how many incomplete applications we get..." (0:12:06). 
            * This points to an inefficiency at the application intake stage. 
        * High Volume of General Emails 
            "...we get, on average we couldn't get up to 500 emails a day and that's just only in the mailbox." (0:20:27). 
            * This suggests a high volume of unorganized communication that likely includes many status inquiries or requests that could be automated. 
        * Inefficient Character Reference Process (now addressed, but historical inefficiency) 
            "Right now we're not doing our character in reputation requests until after they pass the exam because only 40% of them pass the exam and that took out a big chunk of time." (0:16:59) and "I would say about about 20% [of processing time saved by this change]." (0:19:46). 
            * This demonstrates a past, significant inefficiency that has been mitigated. 



* Hypothesis Statement: 
    Targeted improvements to communication, notification systems, and user guidance can increase user satisfaction, reduce application errors, and improve overall process efficiency. 
    * Likely True 
        * Desire for Self-Service / Preference Setting 
            "...we are hoping that something with the online application, they're able to, to provide us with their preference. So we're not going not only just displaying the home address they don't wanna display, but instead of going back and forth with these manual changes, which at that point it won't be manual, but, you know, whatever it is that they want upfront." (0:15:26). 
            * This directly supports the need for a system that captures user preferences upfront, reducing manual corrections. 



        * Need for Automated Status Updates 
            "we would love for them to be able to see the status of their application and be transparent about it without having to have that extra interaction that takes us away from our processing job." (0:15:06). 
            * This explicitly states the desire for automated, transparent status updates to reduce inquiries and improve efficiency. 



        * Value of a Comprehensive Checklist/Pre-screening 
            "...for claims agents we did recently even we developed like a checklist for our paralegals to use in assessing the quality of the application. And maybe that would be something that would be of interest to you all. Yes, absolutely. That sounds very interesting." (0:04:18) and "And absolutely the checklist is gonna be huge for our knowledge. Yeah, we would love to ask of all of the questions that we need to know at one time rather than dragging it out because it's painful for us and them." (0:10:12). 
            * This shows that a structured checklist/pre-screening mechanism can help gather necessary information upfront, reducing back-and-forth. 



        * Addressing "Red Flags" with Upfront Questions 
            "...if they work in this type of work, there's, there's potential for a conflict of in interest if they're a financial planner, if they work in home care, if they're a doctor, all of those things do raise additional questions for us." (0:18:56). 
            * This implies that pre-screening questions could surface these issues early, preventing downstream problems. 



        * Clearer Communication on Public Information 
            The discussion about whether applicants are explicitly told their information will be public and the sharing of approval email templates (0:24:32 - 0:28:31) 
            * This suggests a need for clear, upfront communication regarding privacy and data display. 
        * Addressing Incomplete Applications through Required Fields 
             "...making fields required. Stuff like that is always good because I can't tell you too how many incomplete applications we get..." (0:12:06). 
            * This highlights that guiding users with required fields can improve application quality. 


Key Findings 

* Manual Contact Information Updates 
* Centralized but Decentralized Inquiries: 
* Limited Proactive Outreach for Updates 
* Challenges with Outdated Information 
* Applicant Notification of Public Information 


Details of Findings 

1. Finding: Manual Contact Information Updates 
    The process for updating contact information for accredited representatives (attorneys, claims agents, and VSOs) is largely manual. Attorneys and claims agents can send emails, faxes, or mail, while VSO representatives require their certifying official or assistant to initiate the request. 

    * Supporting data: "Okay. So everything's pretty much manual, like we're the ones that update all the information." - Speaker 1 (0:03:09) 



1. Finding: Centralized but Decentralized Inquiries 
    While there is an OGC accreditation mailbox intended for all accreditation-related inquiries, representatives often send update requests directly to individuals they have previously worked with, leading to multiple points of contact for updates. Margaret Talbot is primarily responsible for monitoring the OGC accreditation mailbox. 

* Supporting data: "Even though we have the mailbox and we strongly encourage people to send the information there to distribute it, a lot of times people will send to maybe the person they're familiar with and they were working with, so they were recently accredited, they might send their responses to that person that they were working with versus sending it to the mailbox and then it gets, you know, forwarded or maybe, you know, one person do them." - Speaker 2 (0:05:54) 



1. Finding: Limited Proactive Outreach for Updates 
    There are currently no ongoing outreach programs to remind representatives or certifying officials to keep their contact information updated, beyond initial accreditation emails and annual recertification projects. It is primarily the representative's responsibility. 

* Supporting data: "But in terms of ongoing outreach, we currently do not have one that I'm aware of where we notify them." - Speaker 2 (0:08:18) 



1. Finding: Challenges with Outdated Information 
     The biggest challenge in keeping information up to date is representatives not notifying OGC of changes. This can lead to returned mail and affect the representatives' ability to receive updated information regarding claims and even impact pay. 

* Supporting data: "I think the challenge is them not letting us know their content information change." (0:10:40)  



1. Finding: Applicant Notification of Public Information 
    For attorneys and claims agents, the approval email explicitly states that their contact information will be publicly displayed on the VA's accredited search index. For VSO representatives, this information is sent to the certifying official, who is expected to advise the representative. The VA Form 21A itself does not contain this notification. 




* Supporting data: "So in the approval email, that language is contained in there. Okay. That their contact information is contained. We tell them they need to verify it, and if they want to change it, we give them instructions on how to do it." (0:24:32) 


Additional Insights 

1. Insight: Challenges with Inconsistent System Functionality 
    The OGC's database (GC laws) has inconsistent functionality between its web and desktop versions, particularly regarding displaying multiple email addresses. This inconsistency can make it difficult for staff to determine what information is accurately displayed or utilized by the system. 



1. Insight: Increased Efficiency by Delaying Character References 
    OGC has significantly improved the efficiency of their application processing (saving about 20% of processing time) by delaying character reference checks until after applicants pass the exam. This change was implemented because a large percentage (60%) of applicants were not passing the exam, making early character reference checks a wasted effort. 


Recommendations 

1. Develop a self-service portal for contact information updates 
    Allow accredited representatives (attorneys, claims agents, and VSOs) to directly update their contact information (email, phone, address, and potentially name changes) through a secure online portal. This would significantly reduce the manual effort currently required by OGC staff and improve the accuracy and timeliness of the data. The portal should clearly indicate which information is publicly displayed and allow users to set preferences (e.g., preferred business address over home address). 

    * Supporting evidence:  
        * "So everything's pretty much manual, like we're the ones that update all the information..." (0:03:09) 
            * This highlights the current manual burden on OGC staff. 
        * "...we actually have to go in and change their information." (0:03:51) 
            * This further emphasizes the manual process. 
        * "...instead of going back and forth with these manual changes, which at that point it won't be manual, but, you know, whatever it is that they want upfront." (0:15:26) 
            * Margaret expresses a desire for a system where preferences are handled upfront, suggesting a portal. 
        * "It's honestly, it's their responsibility to keep us updated when it comes to their information." (0:07:57) 
            * This indicates that representatives should be proactive, aligning with a self-service model. 



1. Implement status tracking and automated notifications for applications 
    Provide applicants with an online dashboard or clear status updates for their accreditation applications. This would reduce the "noise" of frequent inquiries about application status, allowing OGC paralegals to focus on processing. Automated notifications for key milestones (e.g., "application received," "background check initiated," "decision rendered") would keep applicants informed without requiring manual communication. 



    * Supporting evidence: 
        * "I respond to a tremendous amount of congressional inquiries on just status requests because those are really difficult for our paralegals to reply to because they're trying to move, you know, the backlog of cases and that everyone's writing in. Where is it now? Where, where is it now?" (0:14:50) 
            * This clearly states the significant burden of status inquiries on paralegals and the desire to reduce "noise." 
        * "Well if we haven't told you it hasn't moved right and that, that answer is not makes no one happy, we would love for them to be able to see the status of their application and be transparent about it without having to have that extra interaction that takes us away from our processing job." (0:15:06) 
            * This directly supports the need for transparency and automated status updates to free up OGC staff. 
        * "Is there any direction provided immediately once an application is submitted? Like do you guys have an automatic message that goes out? Not one that anyone's happy with?" (0:21:35) 
            * This shows a current lack of effective immediate communication upon submission, indicating a need for automated notifications. 



1. Integrate pre-screening questions and a comprehensive checklist into the application process 
    Digitize the claims agent checklist and embed its questions directly into the online application form. This would allow for immediate screening of applicants based on criteria that currently raise "red flags" (e.g., issues with good standing, specific employment types). 



    * Supporting evidence:  
        * "...for claims agents we did recently even we developed like a checklist for our paralegals to use in assessing the quality of the application. And maybe that would be something that would be of interest to you all. Yes, absolutely. That sounds very interesting." (0:04:18) 
            * The existence and value of this internal checklist for screening are highlighted. 




        * "And absolutely the checklist is gonna be huge for our knowledge. Yeah, we would love to ask of all of the questions that we need to know at one time rather than dragging it out because it's painful for us and them." (0:10:02) 
            * This explicitly states the desire to collect all necessary information upfront to avoid prolonged processes. 




        * "...if they work in this type of work, there's, there's potential for a conflict of in interest if they're a financial planner, if they work in home care, if they're a doctor, all of those things do raise additional questions for us." (0:18:56) 
            * This shows specific "red flags" that could be addressed by targeted pre-screening questions to filter applicants or gather necessary information early. 




        * "...making fields required. Stuff like that is always good because I can't tell you too how many incomplete applications we get..." (0:12:06) 
            * This supports the idea of mandatory fields to ensure complete applications from the start. 




Product User and Business Outcomes 


1. Desired User Outcome 
    This research supports our desired user outcome by focusing on the following user outcomes: 

* Design a digitized version of Form 21a that incorporates new questions needed by VA OGC employees who process applications. 
* Reduce the time for VA OGC employees to review and process accreditation applications. 
* Provide accurate applicant data to VA OGC employees; this will also improve Veteran experiences on VA.gov for related applications. 
* Effectively convey the seriousness and commitment required for accreditation, discouraging applicants who are not genuinely motivated. 
* Create a more efficient accreditation process for applicants. 
* Ensure the accreditation process is accessible to all users, including those using assistive technology. 



1. Desired Business Outcome 
    This research supports our desired business outcome by focusing on the following business outcomes: 

* Reduce the backlog of accreditation applicants (currently around 2,000). 
* Streamline the accreditation process to help VA OGC staff manage applications more efficiently. 
* Decrease the time applicants spend waiting to become accredited, thereby increasing the number of qualified representatives available to assist Veterans. 
* Minimize the need for back-and-forth communication between OGC staff and applicants by capturing required information digitally. 
* Improve applicant and staff satisfaction with the accreditation process, measured by metrics like processing time, error rates, and user feedback. 


Key Performance Indicators 
These KPIs help assess efficiency, system reliability, and user experience improvements resulting from digitizing the accreditation process. 


1. KPI: Average Application Processing Time 

    * Measure the average time it takes for an application to be processed, compared to previous (paper-based) processing times. 
         

1. KPI: Form Submission Success Rate 

    * Track the percentage of successful form submissions versus failed submissions, including metrics such as overall submission volume and submission error percentage. 
         

1. KPI: Applicant Satisfaction (CSAT Score) 

    * Collect and analyze applicant satisfaction through surveys or feedback, using a Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) score. 

Next Steps 


1. Review the Claims Agent Checklist 
    Your team needs to thoroughly review the "CNF agent checklist from May 7th" that Nate mentioned. This checklist is expected to provide insights into what OGC looks for in quality applications and potential "if-then" scenarios. 



1. Ongoing continuous learning with OGC 
    To facilitate ongoing continuous learning with OGC, a structured feedback loop and regular knowledge-sharing sessions should be established. This would involve collecting feedback from paralegals and attorneys on common application issues and "red flags" encountered, especially concerning the new digital forms and updated checklists. 


Further research needed 


1. Investigate the impact of the inconsistent GC Laws functionality 
    Research should be conducted to fully understand the scope and impact of the "iffy" and "inconsistent" functionality between the web and desktop versions of GC Laws, especially regarding how it displays or processes multiple email addresses and other contact information. This would help identify specific pain points for OGC staff and potential data integrity issues. 



1. Explore current post-denial/reapplication communication channels 
    While the document mentions written decisions with appellate rights and occasional email chains for reconsideration, further research could delve into the specific content, frequency, and effectiveness of these communications. Understanding common applicant misunderstandings or persistent questions after a denial could inform the development of clearer, more proactive communication strategies or self-service resources.
