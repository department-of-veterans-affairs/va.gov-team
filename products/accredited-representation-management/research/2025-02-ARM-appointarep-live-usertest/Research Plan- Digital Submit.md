# **Research Plan for ARM Team, Appoint a Representative Digital Submit - VA.gov User Test, 04/2025**

**Office of the CTO - Digital Experience (OCTO-DE)**

Marisa Dominguez, marisa.dominguez\@oddball.io


## **Background**

Create a high-quality accessible service or suite of services within VA.gov to serve Veterans in finding and managing their accredited representatives (Power of Attorney (POA)) and to support the deprecation of the legacy systems used to take those actions.

### **2025 OCTO Priorities**

**Objective 1:** VA’s digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.

[2025 OCTO Priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202025.md#octo-de-priorities-2025)


### **Veteran Journey**

Veterans, their family members, and caregivers can get the help of a representative at any point in the journey where they are submitting claims. Such as; starting up, taking care of myself, retiring, and aging.

## **Research Goals**

- Evaluate the usability of Appoint a Representative with Digital Submit on VA.gov. Usability includes the understandability of content, whether the experience meets user expectations, and identifying system bugs.
- _Stretch goal:_ Evaluate the usability of the Representative Status Widget on VA.gov.


### **Outcome**

- User testing of Appoint a Representative with Digital Submit and the Representative Status Widget on VA.gov will help the team to identify and fix any outstanding user pain points and system bugs in the experience. We are interested in learning more about the AT users and how they experience the product.


### **Research questions**

1. Are there any usability challenges with the Appoint a Representative with Digital Submit feature?
   1. Do users understand the information shown?
      1. Is there any information missing?
   2. Are there any challenges with using the experience?
      1. Is there any confusion with legal portion of the form?
      2. Do users correctly interpret the "Note: If you submit another request, you'll cancel your current one." content on the confirmation page?
   3. Does the experience meet user expectations?
   4. Are all form steps clear and actionable?
   5. Are assistive technology (AT) users able to successfully use the feature?
      1. Is there any information out of order or confusing?    
2. _Stretch goal:_ Are there any usability challenges with the Representative Status Widget?
   1. Same additional questions as above.


### **Hypothesis**

1. Veterans (who utilize screen readers) will be able to successfully navigate Appoint a Representative through tested patterns and informative content.
2. Veterans (who utilize screen readers) will clearly understand whether the process concludes with a PDF or digital submission, as well as the next steps to take upon completion.
3. Veterans will find value in signing in to see their current representative.
4. When signed in, Veterans will expect their information to be pre-filled in the form.


## **Methodology**

- **Warm-up questions /** The moderator will ask the veteran a short series of questions to understand their current situation with finding an accredited representative and VA.gov engagement.
- **Usability testing** / Users will be asked to complete the Appoint a Representative flow on VA.gov and provide feedback along the way.
