## **Intro - 5 minutes**

**AT participants/** Thanks for joining us today! My name is Marisa, and I’m a researcher working for VA.gov. \[NAME] will be joining us to assist with any technology needs today.

Before we get started a few things I want to go over:

**Confirmations**

- I want to confirm a few things from the notes I received prior to our session.
  - During the session we will be asking you to complete a form on VA.gov and provide feedback. While the form is real, you will not be asked to sign in if you do not want to, and completing the form will have no impact on your VA.gov account in any way. Are you comfortable with proceeding?
  - **All participants/** I understand that you are \[searching for/working with] a \[VSO/attorney/claims agent]? Is that correct?
  **AT participants/**
  - What assistive technologies are you using in this session?
  - Do you need a screen reader to access va.gov?
- _If yes;_ Thank you so much for confirming.
- _If no;_ Thank you for showing up today, but unfortunately, we are looking for participants who [are comfortable providing feedback on VA.gov]/[are engaging with representatives]/[use assistive technology]. Perigean will reach out to you to follow-up, but otherwise I’m going to end our session today. Thank you so much for your time. Have a good day.

**Legal**

- **This session should take about an hour.** We’ll be focusing on new experiences on VA.gov.
  - **Screen reader participants/ This session should take about an hour and thirty minutes.** We’ll be focusing on new experiences on VA.gov.
* **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions to help improve digital tools on VA.gov.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback. I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation is completely voluntary.** If for any reason you want to stop, or do not want to answer a question, please let me know. You'll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete today.
- **I want to be transparent that myself and my co-workers are here in a research capacity only.** We want to hear about your experiences, good or bad, in case there are processes we can improve in the future, but we cannot directly impact your benefits in any way.
- **Knowing this, I have \[#] VA employees who would like to observe our session, but are optional.** Would that be okay, or do you prefer to keep the session to just the three of us?
  - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
  - If yes: Admit observers.
    - Then, ask the observer(s) to give a brief, camera-on introduction, first name and position with VA.gov.
    - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observer(s) to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth.
- **Are you ok if I record my screen and audio for analysis and reporting purposes?** We like to record to confirm that we’ve captured your opinions accurately and sometimes share video or audio clips with our colleagues at VA. Nothing is ever shared outside of VA. If we do share video or audio we don’t share anything that identifies you, such as your name or face.
  - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

_Start recording._

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Do I have permission to record my screen and the audio as we talk today for analysis and reporting purposes?
