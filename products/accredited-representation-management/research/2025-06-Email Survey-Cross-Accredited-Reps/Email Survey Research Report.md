## Research Goals
1.	Evaluate the level of understanding among Veteran Service Organization (VSO) representatives regarding the procedures for updating their contact information with the Office of General Counsel (OGC).

2.	Determine how many VSO representatives are aware of who selected their primary organization, whether it was a personal choice or assigned by a director.

3.	Investigate the email preferences of VSO representatives, focusing on which email they use for communication and whether it aligns with the email used by OGC. 

4.	Provide insights into how ARP can help representatives identify their primary email, ensuring effective communication and account access.

5.	Collect data that can inform future training and resource development aimed at improving VSO representatives' understanding of organizational processes and communication methods.

6.	Use the findings to recommend strategies for enhancing communication between VSO representatives and the ARP, ultimately improving service delivery to Veterans.

## Research Questions
1.	Do VSO Reps understand how to update their contact info?
2.	Do VSO Reps know who selected their primary organization? 
3.	Which email does ARP use to pre-set up access accounts?
4.	How can the survey assist in determining which email is their primary email?

## Methodology
We conducted an unmoderated survey that was emailed to the participants. The survey was administered using a third-party tool that allows the participant to fill out the survey online via their browser. It consisted of seven questions. 
•	Method 1: Unmoderated, untimed, optional survey

## Hypotheses and Conclusions
This study hypothesizes that a significant portion of Veteran Service Organization (VSO) representatives lack clarity regarding the processes for updating their contact information and understanding who selected their primary organization. Additionally, it is hypothesized that there is variability in the email preferences among representatives, particularly concerning the email used by OGC. To address these issues, the study aims to identify the primary email preferences of representatives and explore how to assist ARP in determining which email should be designated as their primary contact.

## Key Findings
1.	Limited Understanding of Contact Update Processes
2.	Automatic Organizational Selection Predominates
3.	Preference for Localized Communication
4.	Recommendations Based on Primary Affiliations

## Details of Findings
1.	Finding: Limited Understanding of Contact Update Processes
Approximately 31.65% of VSO representatives reported feeling confident in their knowledge of the process for updating contact information with the Office of General Counsel (OGC). This indicates a significant knowledge gap, suggesting that many representatives may struggle with maintaining accurate contact details.

2.	Finding: Automatic Organizational Selection Predominates
A notable 46.84% of respondents indicated that their choice of primary organization was automatic, while 20.25% stated that their director chose it for them. This finding reflects a lack of agency in organizational selection, potentially impacting representatives' engagement and commitment to their roles.

3.	Finding: Preference for Localized Communication
The survey revealed that a combined 65.38% of representatives preferred County or "Other" email contacts for communication. This preference suggests a desire for more localized and immediate engagement with Veterans, indicating that representatives may feel more connected to community-based resources.

4.	Finding: Recommendations Based on Primary Affiliations
A significant majority (53.16%) of representatives reported recommending the primary organization they work with to Veterans, highlighting a tendency to prioritize organizational affiliations over the specific needs of Veterans. This could limit the options available to Veterans seeking assistance and underscores the need for more personalized recommendation practices.

## Additional Insights
1.	Insight: High Frequency of No Updates Required
Over 50% (50.63%) of the representatives indicated that they have never needed to update their contact information. This finding may suggest a stable working environment or a lack of awareness about the importance of keeping contact details current, which could have implications for communication and outreach efforts.

2.	Insight: Diverse Preferences Indicated by "Other" Category
The significant representation of the "Other" category in email preferences (32.47%) points to a variety of communication needs that are not adequately captured by standard classifications. This indicates an opportunity for organizations to explore and understand specific preferences among representatives, allowing for more tailored and effective communication strategies.

## Recommendations
1.	Enhance Training on Contact Update Processes
Develop targeted training sessions to educate VSO representatives about the procedures for updating their contact information with the Office of General Counsel (OGC). This can improve confidence and ensure accurate communication.

2.	Promote Awareness of Organizational Selection
Implement workshops or informational resources to help representatives understand the implications of their organizational selection and encourage active participation in choosing their primary organization.

3.	Investigate "Other" Email Preferences
Conduct follow-up surveys or focus groups to explore the reasons behind the significant "Other" email preference. Understanding these preferences can lead to more effective communication strategies tailored to individual representative needs.

4.	Regular Communication Audits
Establish a routine process for reviewing and updating contact information to ensure that all representatives have current and accurate details, thereby improving overall communication efficiency.

## Product User and Business Outcomes
1.	User-Friendly Contact Management Tools
Develop intuitive tools within ARP that simplify the process for VSO representatives to update their contact information. Features could include automated reminders for updates and easy access to contact management options.

2.	Feedback Mechanism
Implement a feedback loop within ARP  to gather insights from representatives about their communication preferences and challenges. This data can guide continuous improvement in product features.

3.	Resource Library:
Build a centralized resource library that includes guidelines, FAQs, and best practice documents related to updating contact information and organizational processes, making it easily accessible for representatives.

## Product User and Business Outcomes
1.	Improving User Experience:
The findings highlight a significant knowledge gap regarding the processes for updating contact information and organizational selection. By developing user-friendly contact management tools and integrating training modules, ARP aligns with its goal of enhancing the overall user experience for VSO representatives. These features will make it easier for users to navigate essential tasks, thereby increasing their confidence and efficiency.

2.	Continuous Improvement Through Feedback:
The significant representation in the "Other" category for email preferences points to diverse needs that require ongoing attention. Implementing a feedback mechanism within the product aligns with the goal of continuous improvement. By actively gathering insights from users, the product can adapt to their evolving needs, ensuring relevance and effectiveness.

3.	Building a Comprehensive Resource Hub:
The findings emphasize a need for accessible information regarding organizational processes and communication best practices. Creating a centralized resource library aligns with the product’s goal of providing comprehensive support to users. This resource will enable representatives to find answers quickly, enhancing their efficiency and effectiveness in serving Veterans.

## Key Performance Indicators
1.	Adoption Rates of New Tools:
Recommendations for developing user-friendly contact management tools and collaboration features can be evaluated through adoption rate KPIs. By tracking how frequently representatives utilize these tools, the VA can gauge their effectiveness and make adjustments as needed, ensuring that the representative portal meets user needs.

2.	Feedback and Satisfaction Scores:
Implementing a feedback mechanism will allow for the collection of user satisfaction scores and qualitative feedback. KPIs related to user satisfaction can be established, enabling the organization to measure the overall sentiment towards the product. This data can inform continuous improvement efforts and guide future feature development.

3.	Resource Utilization:
The creation of a centralized resource library can be measured through KPIs that track usage rates and user feedback on the resources provided. Understanding how often representatives access training materials and guidelines will help assess whether the resources are effectively supporting their needs.

4.	Impact on Service Delivery:
Ultimately, the findings and recommendations can contribute to KPIs related to service delivery outcomes for Veterans. By tracking metrics such as resolution times for Veterans’ inquiries and overall satisfaction ratings from Veterans, organizations can measure whether improvements in representative training, communication, and resource accessibility lead to better service outcomes.
