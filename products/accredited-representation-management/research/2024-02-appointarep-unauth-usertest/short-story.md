# Streamlining the Appoint a Representative Process for Veterans

*Insights from the Appoint a Representative Form Usability Study (Unauthenticated), 02/2024*

## tl;dr (too long, didn’t read)

A usability study revealed significant challenges and opportunities to improve the unauthenticated "Appoint a Representative" form experience for Veterans and their caregivers. Key pain points included unclear expectations, a lack of digital submission, and confusion around representative selection.

## What we did

The Accredited Representation Management (ARM) Team at OCTO conducted a mixed-method study, combining semi-structured interviews with usability testing. The goal was to evaluate the clarity, usability, and accessibility of the unauthenticated "Appoint a Representative" form (21-22/21-22a) on desktop and mobile devices. Eight participants, including Veterans and their caregivers, were recruited.

## Key insights

- **Expectation Gap for Digital Submission**  
  Many users were frustrated to learn the form wasn’t digitally submitted.  
  - *“I mean, I really wish that this could be done digitally. There are a lot of us that aren't close by VA.”* (Line 513)

- **Confusion with Representative and Organization Information**  
  Users struggled to understand the connection between representatives and organizations.  
  - *“Why is he part of so many organizations? That almost makes me question him.”* (Line 306)

- **Usability Issues with Permissions and Steps**  
  Participants hesitated to grant address change permissions and misunderstood the review step as final.  
  - *“I don't think that they should have access to anything like that. I don't think that they should be able to change anything at our records period.”* (Line 435)  
  - *“Oh, so page five of five. I like the progress bar because I know I'm done.”* (Line 474)

- **Desire for Better Support Features**  
  Users expressed interest in two-way communication options and representative ratings.  
  - *“I just think there should be some type of record-keeping system where there's information that says, hey, this is why this person didn't help me.”* (Line 251)

## Between the lines

A key insight is the strong demand for a fully digital submission process, reflecting broader trends in user expectations for government services. Additionally, the confusion around representatives and organizations suggests a need for clearer educational content.

## Yes, but

While digital submission is a priority for users, it may not be immediately feasible due to policy or technical constraints. In the interim, improving transparency and setting clear expectations could mitigate frustration.

## Why it matters

Streamlining this process aligns with OCTO’s goal of enhancing the digital experience for Veterans and supporting their journey in accessing benefits with ease and confidence.

## What’s next

1. Update content to clarify that the form is a pre-fill PDF and not digitally submitted.  
2. Explore opportunities to provide detailed representative and organizational information.  
3. Conduct follow-up testing on proposed design changes.
