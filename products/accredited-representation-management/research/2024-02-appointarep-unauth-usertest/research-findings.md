## Research Goals<a id="research-goals"></a>

### Veteran Journey

Veterans can get the help of a representative at any point in the journey where they are submitting benefits. Such as; starting up, taking care of myself, retiring, and aging.

[Full Veteran journey for reference.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)


### Goals

- **FUTURE REPORT/** Understand Veteran’s family or caregiver motivations for seeking representation, why they selected their representative, and what that experience has been like.

- Understand usability of the **signed-out** Appoint a Representative flow (21-22/21-22a forms) on both desktop and mobile devices.


### Outcome

- **FUTURE REPORT/** Information on Veteran’s family or caregiver  motivations and behaviors surrounding representatives will inform the MVP and future experiences.

- User testing will inform adjustments to the Appoint a Representative flow (21-22/21-22a forms) to improve usability.

## Details of Findings<a id="details-of-findings"></a>

### Key

✅ No challenges completing the task

[⚠️](https://emojipedia.org/warning) Caused some hesitation or questions but didn’t stop task completion

[🚫](https://emojipedia.org/prohibited) Unable to complete task without help/would abandon flow

[💡](https://emojipedia.org/light-bulb) Future ideas/good to know


### Task 1/ Veteran family and caregiver expectations and understanding of the landing page.

1. ✅ **Conclusion:** All users understood the task and next steps.

2. [⚠️](https://emojipedia.org/warning) There were **questions and requests for information** about representatives, including;

   1. Clear delineation between free and paid representative options.

   2. Already in the FAQ:

      1. What does it mean to be accredited?

      2. What is a claims agent?

      3. How do I switch VSOs?

      4. _Note: These three topics could have come up due to the fact that the FAQ was not clickable during this study._

3. [⚠️](https://emojipedia.org/warning) Half of users were **concerned the feature would not work** due to previously encountered challenges on VA.gov. _See additional insights for more details._

4. Quotes

   1. _Paid vs free reps/ “So my personal feedback would be that I would like to have those three split up into, I mean, really any fashion at all. They can have parentheses or they can be split up separately. But just to say that there are both free options and paid options, I think that'd be really nice to do upfront.” P3_

   2. _Claims agent/ \[What does claims agent mean to you?] “You know, I don't really know. I really don't know.” P3_

   3. _Claims agent/ \[If you had to guess what a claims agent is, what would you guess it is?] “All I know is like an insurance agent, right? That you file a claim and they investigate it. I dunno, I have no idea what that is. Absolutely no idea what that is.” P9_

   4. _Accreditation confusion/ “I mean what does it mean to be accredited? That's another thing. Like I don't even know what that means. Does that mean you just sign up and pay a fee and you're accredited? Does that mean you've been through a vetting process and a background check and some training and you agree to charge like a certain amount? I mean I, I don't know what accredited means.” P9_

   5. _Switch VSOs/ “Something here, people don't always know that you can switch your VSO, which we've done when you know a specific person left and the additional people just weren't as helpful as the first guy. That could potentially be something to consider here. Signing in to see if you have an accredited representative doesn't necessarily mean that you have to stay with that person.” P3_

   6. _Chat feature/ “In addition, like right, maybe it could be here too to accompany the phone number or maybe some kind of text chat option with Brian.” P11_


### Task 2/ Complete the 21-22 form. Provide feedback at each step.

#### Form start

1. [🚫](https://emojipedia.org/prohibited) **Conclusion:** Users **easily missed that the flow is not a digital submission**, and wanted more information up front on what to expect. Including clear steps and necessary information for the form.

2. [🚫](https://emojipedia.org/prohibited) Users were looking for **clearer instructions up front** to set expectations that the form is a pre-fill PDF, not a digital submit.

   1. Only **one user** noticed that the form was not digital.

3. [⚠️](https://emojipedia.org/warning) Most users wanted a **list of required** information before entering the form.

   1. Especially since they were completing the form on behalf of the Veteran, and may not have their information readily available.

4. [💡](https://emojipedia.org/light-bulb) Half of users mentioned they’d **sign-in to to autofill information**.

5. Quotes

   1. _List of required information/ “You know, that an information list to be prepared before you bother signing in to fill out anything might be like a preparatory, you know what I mean? I would think that would be a helpful thing. Somebody could like go and look at this and see this and then go back in your bedroom in strong box or wherever all their information is of, you know, dates that you were, you know, needed or whatever information from your doctors or whatever. But I would think you would need to have all that stuff right before you get to filling out stuff. Be prepared.” P5_

   2. _Better expectations/ \[Is there anything that we could have provided upfront that would've prepared you that this is a paper form?] “Maybe something on the first page kind of going over like what the process would look like, like before you start searching for a VSO? Just kind of a, like a heads up or a landing page with what the process looks like overall. I know that I, like if I was doing this I would be like, yeah, forget that. I'll just go reach out to the VSO myself.” P8_

      1. [__https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/af96500c-8362-4803-b3c2-b0cf19e1fe82__](https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/af96500c-8362-4803-b3c2-b0cf19e1fe82)

   3. _Caregiver accounts/ “I think the only thing would be, and I know I've, so I've done a few of these before and I've talked about like how it would be really great to have like a login for the caregiver if the caregiver doesn't necessarily have like a, a Veteran, like a va.gov login themselves or is someone representing the, the Veteran. So like if I was just a military spouse and didn't have, you know, va.gov access instead of having me sign in under my dad's account or my husband's account, having like a secondary thing so that you, so that like you as the caregiver can sign in would be kind of nice. But I know that's like a bigger thing and not just for this project.” P8_


#### Step 1 of 5/ Accredited representative information/ Representative search

1. [⚠️](https://emojipedia.org/warning) **Conclusion:** Inconclusive if this task will be a challenge with the live experience due to study limitations.

   1. **Limitations of study:** There were concerns from users on how they would select a representative. Users did not see the Find a Representative tool, but did notice the link. Have not received this feedback on previous studies. _Recommend keeping an eye on these behaviors in Find a Representative research to see if they continue._

   2. ✅ Users did notice the ‘Find a Representative’ link and mentioned they would **use it to find representatives local to their area**.

2. [⚠️💡](https://emojipedia.org/warning) Half of users wanted more information about the representative to **help in the decision making process**. Information requested included;

   1. \*Peer rating system

   2. Picture of representative

   3. \*Availability tracker

   4. Dates of accreditation

   5. Government supplied email

   6. Languages spoken

   7. Link to VSO website showing representative

   8. \*Support specialty

   9. \*Office hours

3. [⚠️](https://emojipedia.org/warning) Most users assumed that they would **only be supported by the Veterans Service Officer**, not the organization. This was typically due to their previous experiences with VSOs presenting themselves as ‘exclusive’. (P2, P3, P9)

   1. **One user** expected to be supported by the entire organization, but are a VSO employee and volunteer.

4. Quotes

   1. _Representative search/ “Okay. So I'm trying to go back and see if I can find an accredited representative to represent me without having to type his name in. Okay … So the name isn't going to mean anything to me. It's going to say his name is Brian. Daniel. Well, who is Brian? Daniel? What is he, what is his credentials? Why am I picking him? I have no idea why I'm picking him. So am I gonna end up with another dud? Probably, you know, just, I don't know.” P2_

      1. [__https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/b3f1f336-ace6-4461-bd37-155751264816__](https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/b3f1f336-ace6-4461-bd37-155751264816) __

   2. _Rating system/ “I just think there should be some type of record keeping system where there's information that says, hey, this is why this person didn't help me. And then not accept that person in the programs anymore. And not, I mean, not allow them to help because they're not helping and we don't know what they're doing with our information. We don't know where it's going. So it puts a little bit of a concern out there with HIPPA and other, other concerns like, why are they using our data? What are they using it for if they're not actually reaching back out to us? So I think like having a system where we can actually share our voices with each of these persons, putting a rating system in kind of like, kinda like what Google Review does or Amazon review or whatever reviews. I think it's really important. And then that way other people can avoid those people that are not really doing their jobs.” P2_

      1. [__https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/c5d3ebad-ba96-4006-91fb-dffe34f521e0__](https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/c5d3ebad-ba96-4006-91fb-dffe34f521e0) __

   3. _Availability tracker/ \[So some way to mark them as available at this time.] “Right. You know, kinda like when you're looking for a medical provider and they say we're taking new patients, you know, if they're not no use calling. Right. So, but, so if this guy is available, you know, that would be good. You know, it would maybe at the top and then, then I could email him or call him or whatever.” P6_

   4. _Language spoken/ “And another question, if my wife's using these services on my behalf, I guess would there be somebody that could talk to her in Chinese if she requested it? … Yeah, I would think Spanish and yeah, Chinese and I mean there's a few different languages that are, you know, kind of predominant over here, you know, so it would be helpful because yeah, it's difficult for her to understand that stuff. So she usually has me do all this stuff for her.” P6_

   5. _\[What could be done to make this more trustworthy for you?] “I could have a picture of him. I could have a link to something where I see something official, like the DAV site. If I see him on the DAV site, like maybe that's okay. Maybe he could have some sort of\@dav.org. At va.gov. Like some kind of official email address that's not a Gmail and his area code, he should have a local phone number. I mean I know his cell phones, like I have a Philly phone number and I haven't lived there in a long time. But this is an official person, right? This isn't just your, your friend that you have lunch or play tennis with. This is an official person that's helping you. So like with our VSOs that help us, they have a text.gov email address and they have like an official phone number and they have an office where you visit them.” P9_

      1. [__https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/f4bf035e-d0ef-4f10-872d-ef76b518bed9__](https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/f4bf035e-d0ef-4f10-872d-ef76b518bed9)

   6. _Photo wanted/ “So not fraudulent individuals on VA, but just in meeting people outside, like at court or at a place like him who may be misrepresenting themselves as Brian. Like if I never met him before, I would like to know, I know what he looks like.” P11_

   7. _Exclusive representative/ “I don't really know what they're asking because I'm, I think I'm working with Brian, but now I'm all of a sudden working with an organization. \[Expand on that a little bit. What are your thoughts on that?] So if I'm working with Brian, it, this form should pretty much not ask me what VSO I wanna work with, right? Because if I already know that I'm working with Brian exclusively, why am I being asked which veterans organization I wanna work with? With the way this is, this is appearing is he's a part of one of the part of these groups. And now I get to choose a group or organization rather than, am I, am I working with him and the disabled Americans, American veterans, and the American Legion or whatever I choose here, am I selecting an organization to work with as well? \[Would you expect to be working exclusively with Brian or would you, if he say, was working for disabled American veterans, would you expect to work with the entire organization and Brian might be your main point of contact?] Okay. So I would've expected that. Okay. So if he said, I'm with Disabled Americans Veterans, I will be, you'll be working with the organization to assist you in this process. I am your go-to person if you need any assistance so that we can all assist you as a group that, but that's not how they talk. So they talk like they are, they are exclusive and that they, even though they're part of the organization, that they're the only ones that you're gonna be speaking to. So that's, that's how they, that's how they speak. So maybe they should change the way they talk and the way they, the way they make themselves sound so important. So they're working within the organization. And I know that the last person that I was working with, not the last person, the person I went to the hospital, he was working for the DAV. When I saw that, I was like, oh yeah, he's with the DAV. So, so I know that they're part of the organization, but if you're going this, this almost looks like you're gonna be working with the organization versus working with that person. So I, I don't know, maybe, maybe it's the same thing. I don't know? \[Which would you prefer?] I would prefer to know that, I mean an organization, if an entire organization actually had your back, which I know is not really possible based on experience, that would be great. But like I said, these people address themselves as they’re representing you only like they're the only person a part of that group that's representing you. So maybe this is confusing that this is, I think this is the only, this is a, I think this is the confusing part right here. What, what organization? Because first it starts out with, I'm working with Brian and all of a sudden I'm in an organization and I'm like, what do you mean organization? I thought I was working with Brian. Does that make sense?” P2_

      1. [__https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/c37ce2b1-7836-497e-bc70-c88e0df3cfbb__](https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/c37ce2b1-7836-497e-bc70-c88e0df3cfbb) __

   8. _Exclusive representative/ \[And when it says Brian, Daniel and type VSO, do you expect to only be supported by Brian Daniel or do you expect the support from the entire organization?] “Oh, based on my experience, I know that it's just him unfortunately because that means once Brian Daniel is gone, I'm screwed. So it would be really, really nice if that wasn't the the truth that I know to be true. But I mean that's a bigger change than probably what you guys are focused on right now.” P3_

      1. [__https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/2b560ef6-0343-4b1b-88a7-43febce69f35__](https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/2b560ef6-0343-4b1b-88a7-43febce69f35) __

   9. _Entire organization support/ “I would say entire DAV … I mean if I'm gonna, if I'm gonna pick an office or like a VSO to be represented by, I would assume that like if there's some chance that like this, this guy doesn't know, you know, enough about my situation or my claim, it wouldn't be like a, well sorry I can't help you. It would be like a, I'm gonna connect you to someone in my office who knows more about this kind of claim or you know, or how to, how to better help you. And so like getting your team to work on it instead of it just being one person. I feel like that would kind of be the, the way that I would like to see it done. And also like, I don't know if there's a, if there's a way to delineate when you're picking out your representative, whether you are looking for someone who's really good at filing claims or disputing the A claim denial, depending on what it is you need the representative for, it might be nice to kind of like have the accredited representatives sectioned off as far as like who is, you know, who's capable of doing which of those things instead of like reaching out to this person and then getting shuffled off to someone else who, who's better qualified to like file the claims or do one of the other things that you might need a rep for.” P8_

#### Step 1 of 5/ Accredited representative information/ Organization selection

1. [🚫](https://emojipedia.org/prohibited) **Conclusion:** Most users were **unsure how** to select an organization or why it was there.

2. [🚫](https://emojipedia.org/prohibited) Most users were **unsure how** to select an organization or why it was there. Main reasons why included;

   1. Unsure **what benefits each organization provides**, and if they’re different from one another. (P5, P9, P11)

   2. **Too many options**, didn’t feel genuine. (P3)

   3. The Veterans Service Officer is **their only support**, so why would they select an organization? (P2)

3. [⚠️](https://emojipedia.org/warning) When asked how they’d select an organization users stated they would select;

   1. An organization they’d **heard of or seen advertised**. (P5, P8)

   2. An organization they can relate to. (P3, P11)

      1. _Example; my husband was in a foreign war, so I prefer Veterans of Foreign Wars because they understand his situation. (P3)_

   3. The largest organization because they ‘have more power’. (P3)

   4. The organization the VSO informed them to select. (P9)

4. [⚠️](https://emojipedia.org/warning) **One user, who is a VSO employee and volunteer**, would prefer to select the organization prior to selecting the representative.

5. Quotes

   1. _Why so many organizations/ “Oh my gosh, this guy is affiliated with so many things. That makes me really wonder like why? Why is he part of so many of these? That almost makes me question him. That's too much. \[Why does that make you question him?] It doesn't seem genuine. It's way too many things. Okay. Realistically in my understanding, like I mean the American Legion, the VFW, a lot of these just, they don't seem real or valid and it almost feels like, it feels a little cheesy that if he's become a member of all these different places, like what's he, what's the end game here, why are you in so many places? But that's just me and I'm just not a super trusting person of the VA because we've been burned so many times and maybe this is reflective of where you live and it would show me somebody local and I would really prefer to have that if it is an option. But again, definitely not a deal breaker.” P3_

      1. [__https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/e6163915-e6cd-4e70-91b6-6efbba2fed89__](https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/e6163915-e6cd-4e70-91b6-6efbba2fed89)

   2. _Unsure which organization to pick/ “I mean I don't like that it's so many of them, particularly if I was new to this and I didn't know what I was doing. So when I say that, I mean personally I'm gonna go look for the largest entity here because I think that gives him more power, more understanding and probably more education and experience as well as a network to reach out to. So I am purely judging these off of some of their names and thinking that like some of these might be really small guys and while I appreciate what they're doing or trying to do, they might not have the backing in support of somebody bigger with more money who's been around longer. So for me personally, I mean I shy away from the American Legion a bit because I, we're a, we're a wartime family and so I'm gonna go to the VFW over the American Legion, but I just do still know that they are a very large, well educated group in my opinion. So I'd probably go to the DAV, which is the second one there, or Vietnam Veterans. But again, like I, a lot of these would, would turn me off if I didn't fit into them. So whereas I know the Vietnam veterans really know their stuff and they're probably the the right guys for the job.” P3_

      1. [__https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/4820d2eb-89b8-494f-abff-fa696e5c1ebd__](https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/4820d2eb-89b8-494f-abff-fa696e5c1ebd) __

   3. _Unsure about organization/ “I don't really have any thoughts about it. Is it, in what way are they working with this organization? I'm, I'm, I'm kind of lost at what the meaning of this is. What, why, why, why is it even here? I mean I'm, you know, is this basically asking me who, who I want somebody that has like, experience with the American Legion or Disabled American Veterans or what is it really asking me here? I don't, I'm not kind of lost the, it says it works with more than one service. What would that have to do with my personal case?” P5_

      1. [__https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/da993c2b-1486-4797-b4c9-363e23a23695__](https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/da993c2b-1486-4797-b4c9-363e23a23695) __

   4. _Wants organization first/ “So I think having like selecting an accreditor representative and just seeing a bunch of names instead of maybe being able to look at the orgs first. Like whether it's like DAV Wood Warrior project, you know, department of veteran services, maybe having that be the first thing that searches and then having the option to like look at the representatives themselves because like, I don't know, like assuming the veteran is new to all of this, they might not have a lot of experience or they might not know specific people within the orgs but they might know of the organizations. So like it seems a a little arbitrary to have the names be the first thing that come up unless you're someone that's like already done a ton of research and you're like, this is the person that I want to, to represent me and I know that because I did the legwork and research this before going to the VA page.” P8_

      1. [__https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/f4a5173d-bbf5-4f88-a56a-9dbabd8c8e74__](https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/f4a5173d-bbf5-4f88-a56a-9dbabd8c8e74) __

   5. _What organization to select/ “So this assumes I already picked Brian and this is showing me the different like, like what the heck difference does this make? I don't understand. Like if I'm Jewish, I'm supposed to work with the Jewish war veterans. If I'm Polish, I'm supposed to work with the Polish veterans. I don't understand this. Like how would I know, how in the world would I know unless Brian, I met Brian at the, wherever he works, DAV and Brian told me, make sure you, you know, pick DAV or make sure you pick Vietnam Veterans of America. But how would I know what to pick?” P9_

#### Step 1 of 5/ Accredited representative information/ Contact representative

1. [⚠️](https://emojipedia.org/warning) **Conclusion:** Inconclusive if this task will be a challenge with the live experience due to study limitations.

   1. **Limitations of study:** There were concerns from users on how they would contact the representative. Users did not see the Find a Representative tool with this study. Have not heard similar concerns in previous studies. _Recommend keeping an eye on these behaviors in Find a Representative research to see if they continue._

2. [⚠️](https://emojipedia.org/warning) ****Negative feedback was due to;

   1. Previously being **unable to get in contact with their VSO** for weeks or months at a time. (P3)

   2. Previous **difficulty navigating the VA phone systems**. (P6)

   3. **Unsure if the representative was ‘legit’** and safe to contact. (P9)

3. ✅ Neutral/Positive feedback included;

   1. **No challenges** as they would have met the representative in person first. (P2)

   2. **Would call or email at this stage** using provided information. (P5)

4. Quotes

   1. _Contact frustrations/ “Okay. So essentially here you've led me to this page, you the the third party, you this site has led me here and now all of a sudden it's saying I may have in, in my opinion I may have given you bad information about somebody who's not available and who's not currently working with people. We're taking on new cases so I'm asking you to reach out and try to figure out if they wanna work with you or not. In my history that's sending an email that doesn't get responded to for two or three weeks, maybe I forget that I'm doing this and then that two or three weeks and we've just added on additional time to me actually getting anywhere in this whole process I might call them and go through a lot of different channels trying to actually talk to a person which is frustrating or have the wrong name and number there in my experience. So I mean I understand the value and having this here, but it, it frustrates me to say like there's one person, you've gone this far down the path and now you've gotta figure out if they're currently accepting people or if they wanna work with you or if they're even real and still attached to this organization.” P3_

      1. [__https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/51560222-c5ec-45da-9338-419befc7f2b4__](https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/51560222-c5ec-45da-9338-419befc7f2b4) __

   2. _Data dead end/ “And I realized like it is a lot of work to go in here and say we're gonna guide you to someone we know the information's accurate and up to date we know that they're accepting people, yada yada. That's a lot of work. So I don't have a solution for you on that but, and my history, we've gotten this far and it's been a total dead end.” P3_

      1. [__https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/4fc090b4-fa1f-4565-a309-598dd3628f43__](https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/4fc090b4-fa1f-4565-a309-598dd3628f43) __

   3. _Bad phone system/ “Okay. You'll need to, you'll need to contact the accredited representative you selected to make sure they're available to help you, you know, idea the, I I think that these should be vetted to make sure that the representative you contact is still providing this service. Because sometimes when you make phone calls to, to businesses in general, you get transferred all around and they have these automated systems and it's quite frustrating. And so I, if he wasn't available to help me, maybe maybe there'd be a way to lick or identify or sort by available to help, you know, something like that. Or if there was a, a waiting list for to talk to somebody.” P6_

   4. _Safety first/ “Okay. So then it says that I need to contact him. So why can't I contact him at the DAV at the VA regional office? Why do I have his Gmail and why do I have, I think that's Nevada. I'm not sure. But like why isn't his contact information matching where he is alleged to work? This is bothering me. \[Speak a bit more about that.] Well like I said, if he is supposed to be working, my experience with VSOs is they've all been government employees, the county or the state. So they have official email addresses. They have an office at the county office or in the va. Right? Like I know that they're legit because I can verify them and this person, he could be anyone. He could be absolutely anyone and he could be stealing my dad's disability money.” P9_

   5. _Correspondence in VA.gov/ “Do I go on to continue? Yep. Okay. Contact. Okay. So if I were to contact Brian, contact Brian, would the correspondence be saved in the VA website or once I contact him, like I'm outside and into my own personal email? \[How would you want it to work?] I would want to be able to have like a saved correspondence here and then have a copy to my personal email.” P11_


#### Step 2 of 5/ Claimant information

1. ✅ **Conclusion:** All users understood the task and next steps.

2. ✅ Users stated that the ‘Claimant information’ section was **‘pretty easy’**.

3. [⚠️](https://emojipedia.org/warning) One user, who was a friend and caregiver, **assumed they were the accredited representative**, and would select the radio button accordingly.

4. Quotes

   1. _Would select accredited representative/ “Tell us how you connected to the veteran and I for me, you know, I, I have a, we don't have a relationship listed here, right? Well, I guess I would be is accredited representative, I guess you would call it. \[Which one would you select here?] Well, I would think I'm, I don't know about the word accredited, what that really implies, but I'm, I'm, I'm a mentor more than an accredited representative. I'm a mentor that representative, so I would click on accredited 'cause as he chose me to help him.” P5_

   2. _Step tracker not moving/ “So I dunno if I'm supposed to pay attention to this or not, but the two outta five doesn't feel like it's moving. Maybe that doesn't matter, maybe it really is but I keep looking up there and feeling like, like the last like three pages have said two outta five. \[What are your thoughts on that?] I do wanna know how far along I am in the process, but if it doesn't work 'cause then it doesn't serve me any value. It is nice to know that this might take me five more minutes versus an extra hour, you know, for example. So I do like having the progress. That form was all easy enough. Oh look it moved.” P3_

      1. [__https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/5273e182-fd6c-41b8-9eca-3c78aad3d018__](https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/5273e182-fd6c-41b8-9eca-3c78aad3d018)

   3. _Language request/ “Yeah. Is this available in multiple languages? My wife doesn't speak much English and she would probably be much more comfortable if it was in Chinese or something, you know, if there were a way to highlight it in, you know, translate it or something, you know what I mean?” P6_


#### Step 3 of 5/ Veteran information

1. ✅ **Conclusion:** All users understood the task and next steps.

2. [⚠️](https://emojipedia.org/warning) Users were **split on whether or not** they’d have the Veterans information on hand, especially social security number.

3. Quotes

   1. _“Maybe if there's an option to not have things mailed because I know how long it takes the VA to mail things. Digital forms would be, would be better. \[Communication preferences essentially.] Yeah, I just know that like I get appointment reminders for appointments that have been like two months past or like, yeah stuff like that. So if, if there's a way to be more efficient and not risk things going missing in the mail, I would prefer, you know, different comms options.” P8_

      1. [__https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/c3bf30d9-f809-4277-a054-e0d2599cd489__](https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/c3bf30d9-f809-4277-a054-e0d2599cd489) __


#### Step 4 of 5/ Accredited representative permissions/ Medical records

1. ✅ **Conclusion:** All users understood the task and next steps.

2. [⚠️](https://emojipedia.org/warning) Some users were concerned about medical records being **released without the Veterans knowledge**.

3. [⚠️](https://emojipedia.org/warning) One user previously encountered that if medical records were not released that the **VSO would not move forward** and wanted that information more front and center.

4. ✅ All users were **comfortable with providing access** to the Veterans medical records to aid in claim submission.

5. ✅ There were **no differences in preference or use** between the accordion or button style for legal content.

6. Quotes

   1. _Record release/ “We also potentially have a situation there where I just okayed somebody else to view his medical records with or without his authorization, which could be an issue. It's not a problem that we fight but they're bad people so things happen.” P3_

   2. _VSO support/ “I feel like you need like an asterisk at the bottom of this, of the the third option the no because if they can't access your records, you, in my experience, you can't move forward. Okay. So I don't know what that actually does, but if it kicks you out or whatever, I would wanna have information about that.” P3_

      1. [__https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/c386c2d7-660d-47ab-b9d4-f0d37a1434af__](https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/c386c2d7-660d-47ab-b9d4-f0d37a1434af) __


#### Step 4 of 5/ Accredited representative permissions/ Address change

1. [⚠️](https://emojipedia.org/warning) **Conclusion:** Most users would select ‘no’ to address change permissions, and **asking this question caused hesitation and/or discomfort.**

   1. **Note:** This could be due to the fact that this is a digital form and most participants would be signed in, allowing them to update their address in real time versus relying on the representative. _Recommend tracking this step for drop off post launch._

2. [⚠️](https://emojipedia.org/warning) Reasons users would not grant permissions to change their address included;

   1. Don’t know why they’d need to change my address. **Doesn't feel necessary.** (P2, P3, P8, P11)

   2. What if the representative **gets the address wrong?** (P2, P9)

3. [⚠️](https://emojipedia.org/warning) Almost all users expected the address change to be **for the Veteran _not_ the claimant.**

4. Quotes

   1. _What if they get the address wrong/ “I don't think that they should have access to anything like that. I don't think that they should be able to change anything at our records period. \[And why is that?] Would you, would you allow somebody you don't know to change your address, your profile information, anything about you without their personal written consent that says we're going to change it to your current address. Here is the old address and here's your current address. Do you mind if I change it? Sure, I consent, but I don't, I don't, I wouldn't, I wouldn't feel comfortable just being like, yeah, you can change anything on my profile information. Go ahead. Or on my address. So I, I just wouldn't have the map access that. What if they're wrong too? Let's say they're wrong. What address are they gonna be using?” P2_

      1. [__https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/5c0d98ec-71a3-46e4-9eea-69f786f91833__](https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/5c0d98ec-71a3-46e4-9eea-69f786f91833) __

   2. _Not necessary/ “I mean is this necessary, this authorization to change address thing or could it just be like a brief reminder to go update your own address since you're already logged in? \[What are your thoughts on, on that?] I don't know if this is necessary.” P8_

      1. [__https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/1edfeac1-d55a-4393-ab5c-b93d3a362a14__](https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/1edfeac1-d55a-4393-ab5c-b93d3a362a14) __

   3. _Address wrong/ “Yeah. You know what? When I saw yes, they can change my address, I'm thinking, wait, who's changing my address? Like I would change it. The representative wouldn't change it. It seemed like it would be someone else in control of that, which is why I said, oh no, what is that? So if I did need to change the address, I would be the one to update that. Right. \[You, would you want to change your address?] Yes, I would wanna be the one to update that, to make sure it's correct. Review our address authorization. So I would have to review the policy before any adjustments or updates were made.” P11_

      1. [__https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/18d80efd-a316-4d3c-9748-117319bb525b__](https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/18d80efd-a316-4d3c-9748-117319bb525b) __

   4. _Address change for Veteran/ “I would assume that it would be changing my dad's address because he is the, the beneficiary in this case.” P8_


#### Step 5 of 5/ Review

1. [⚠️](https://emojipedia.org/warning) **Conclusion:** None of the button options properly conveyed that there was a step after the review page misleading user expectations.

2. [⚠️](https://emojipedia.org/warning) No matter the button presented (Complete Form, Confirm, or Continue) **every user assumed they were done with the task and would have no further steps** after the Review page.

   1. One user assumed they were done because the progress bar was completed.

3. [⚠️](https://emojipedia.org/warning) One participant noticed in the Terms & Conditions that power of attorney was mentioned. Made the participant uncomfortable, and they wanted it **more clear** that the form being filled out is a limited power of attorney.

4. Quotes

   1. _Complete form button/ \[What do you expect to happen when you hit complete form?] “That everyone, everything will auto populate and I'll be done. \[And when you say auto-populate, what does that mean to you?] So that everything that I have clicked is in and the form is done. And if I click on that button, it's gonna be all set.” P1_

      1. [__https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/afbe39e5-4ce4-427b-9679-7cd4700f0a3e__](https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/afbe39e5-4ce4-427b-9679-7cd4700f0a3e) __

   2. _Confirm button/ \[What do you expect to happen when you hit confirm?] “I don't know. I, I would think that, I, I would think and hope that it's going to, you know, basically put me in with this Brian Daniel or whatever this he, I I would think that, that this is confirming that I've selected him and I I agreed to him being my attorney. Is that what, is that what the agreement is here? Is that what I'm confirming? \[Is that how you expect it to be?] That's that I would want it to be, if that's who I selected, if they, he's the name I, you I'm giving all this information is going to him, then I'm, I, I've selected in my mind that that made me select them.” P5_

      1. [__https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/15759962-a0df-491c-a012-626a499ed398__](https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/15759962-a0df-491c-a012-626a499ed398)

   3. _Continue button/ \[Before you hit continue, what do you expect to happen when you click continue?] “Like some sort of confirmation page like the, the representative has been selected instructions on next steps in the process. Maybe a timeline. Whether it's like a, a window like three to five business days or blah blah blah. Like something like that. It could be as simple as that but yeah. Some sort of timeline guidance.” P8_

      1. [__https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/a70dd6d3-3a14-4b92-919f-e55fa886b2e2__](https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/a70dd6d3-3a14-4b92-919f-e55fa886b2e2) __

   4. _Done because of progress bar/ “Oh so page five of five. Okay, well that's helpful. I like the progress bar at the top so I know I'm done. Okay, so this is assuming I did all of it. Review the terms and conditions and so this is basically saying if I wanted to like go back to Dasia, it's replacing the new guy. Yeah, that makes sense.” P9_

      1. [__https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/fd6819e1-8c71-4d5e-af22-7da264ee7635__](https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/fd6819e1-8c71-4d5e-af22-7da264ee7635) __

   5. _Power of attorney/ “And so I didn't go through all the steps, but like right here on this popup with the terms and conditions, it says that I've given this person power of attorney and that hasn't come up before. Like maybe if I'd actually filled out the form but it hasn't come up in this process that what I'm actually doing is giving them power of attorney. And I know that 'cause we've done that process several times but that hasn't come up and that's a big deal. And that's another reason I would not just pick brian\@gmail.com because power of attorney is a big thing and every time I've been with my parents and we're, we're going through this and we have to sign it, I just clarify now this is just for his VA. Right. This isn't anything else. 'cause with elderly people you just, you can't be too careful. Right?” P9_

      1. [__https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/d208e76e-9f85-46d9-9afd-2e969ab6a69d__](https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/d208e76e-9f85-46d9-9afd-2e969ab6a69d) __


### Task 3/ Veteran family and caregiver expectations and understanding of the next steps.

1. [🚫](https://emojipedia.org/prohibited) **Conclusion:** Most participants were frustrated that the form was not digitally submitted, and some would abandon the experience at this time.

2. [🚫](https://emojipedia.org/prohibited) Most users expected the form to be digitally submitted after the review page, which lead to frustration and some users mentioning they’d abandon the flow.

   1. This was mostly due to;

      1. The user **missing critical information** on the form entry page.

      2. **Use of confirmation buttons** on the review page.

      3. The **review step being the final step** in the progress tracker.

   2. Two users didn’t notice that the form was **not** digitally submitted.

   3. One user saw the instructions but was **confused** on whether they should submit or the representative would.

3. [💡](https://emojipedia.org/light-bulb)Two users were looking for the representative contact information on the page to **follow-up on next steps**.

4. [💡](https://emojipedia.org/light-bulb)Representatives office hours to know when they could **drop the form off.**

5. [💡](https://emojipedia.org/light-bulb) After completing the experience, **half of users** remembered filling out the 21-22 in person, the other half assumed they had filled out the 21-22, but weren’t sure.

6. Quotes

   1. _Still so much to do/ “I'd be like, oh God, I have so much more to do. Okay. And I think it's because we're all moving a million miles a minute. It's like you just wanna go in and have it be done and then it's like you've, you've done everything you need to do. It seems like another layer of a task and I would not want to mail it from my home. I'd want to go to the post office. Gotcha. And probably do registered mail because it's an important document. But it would save so much time if I could just e-sign it, get it to the VSO rep and then go from there.” P1_

      1. [__https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/da38742c-0608-4112-99a2-a4505b1f5f50__](https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/da38742c-0608-4112-99a2-a4505b1f5f50) __

   2. _Aren’t close to VA to take to officer/ “I mean I really wish that this could be done digitally. Again, there are a lot of us that aren't close by VA and it's just, it takes like a half a day to do things like this. The VAs are busy and you're gonna go fight through traffic and you're gonna go fight through parking issues and then get into a really busy facility and then either make an appointment if you know you're supposed to or wait in line a whole freaking day to get all of this done. It could be simplified so nicely if the VA just had the backend ability to do some of these things. And I realize that some of this might need to be done in person because of the, the nature of what it actually is.” P3_

      1. [__https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/e2b3a9f1-cd39-455d-8361-d4a78a441b96__](https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/e2b3a9f1-cd39-455d-8361-d4a78a441b96) __

   3. _Not able to travel/ “Also if I am a disabled veteran and I don't get out of the house much, going to someone's office in person doesn't sound super stellar and also waiting for mail again not great. So maybe adding the option to like send it and have it DocuSigned or something would be helpful. Like we are in a digital age, digital things should be an option.” P8_

   4. _Do I submit or does the rep?/ “If he signed it and I signed it, how come he sends it back to me? How come he wouldn't just upload it and get it going? Is there any reason? \[Would you expect that if once you signed it and he signed it, he would send it in for you?] That, that's what I would think would happen because I'm designated him as my representative so if I hadn't signed it, it would make sense to send it to me and then I could submit it. But if I signed it first and then he signed it second, you know, why would I need it back?” P6_

   5. _Assumed the form was digitally submitted/ \[So what would your next steps be? Walk me through that.] “Well, a, after I would imagine I've confirmed everything and I would think the ball is now in this Brian Daniels court. It's up to him to, I guess I'd be waiting for him to contact, you know, us and after I have all my forms are done, I guess he, they'd have to put me on some kind of schedule and for an appointment. And I guess I just have to sit and wait for that. So be patient.” P5_

      1. [__https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/2441daf7-32c7-43b4-8f51-2bc74e98d966__](https://app.enjoyhq.com/sh/hl/2441daf7-32c7-43b4-8f51-2bc74e98d966) __

   6. _Remember the 21-22/ “I don't. Okay. And it reminds me that that that form name just doesn't ring a bell to me. It makes me wanna Google it and see what it looks like.” P3_

   7. _Remember the 21-22/ “So fill out a form. So we've always filled out this form in the office. Like the, is this the power of attorney that you fill out? Like where you give them limited power of attorney to file the claim? Yeah, so I, I mean power of attorney is like a pretty big thing. So I would not do that form online. Okay. I, I don't think I might look for someone and then go to the office and fill that out. But I don't, I mean I'm pretty open to online and my, my parents are not, but I don't think I do like a power of attorney online. I think I'd go in person and do that.” P9_


### Task 4/ Veteran family and caregiver adoption and final feedback.

1. [⚠️](https://emojipedia.org/warning) **Conclusion:** Continue to hear positive feedback on the ‘Find a Representative’ feature, but potential challenges with non digital submit ‘Appoint a Representative’.

2. [🚫](https://emojipedia.org/prohibited) Some users would not use the Appoint a Representative feature. Either due to the lack of digital submit, or because they’d rather complete the form in person instead.

3. ✅ Many participants spoken to are actively searching for representation, and are looking for tools to do so. Making Find a Representative a good fit for their needs.

4. Quotes

   1. _Would abandon flow/ \[So you mentioned at this point you would just call the representative and leave the form essentially?] “Yeah.” P8_

   2. _Would complete in person/ “So fill out a form. So we've always filled out this form in the office. Like the, is this the power of attorney that you fill out? Like where you give them limited power of attorney to file the claim? Yeah, so I, I mean power of attorney is like a pretty big thing. So I would not do that form online. Okay. I, I don't think I might look for someone and then go to the office and fill that out. But I don't, I mean I'm pretty open to online and my, my parents are not, but I don't think I do like a power of attorney online. I think I'd go in person and do that.” P9_

   3. _Excited for Find a Rep/ “Oh, cool. Well this looks, this looks like something great. My initial reaction to it is like, where have you been in all my life?” P5_

   4. _Excited for Find a Rep/ “So find an accredited representative. Like I would definitely use that. In fact, if this exists now I will use it because I think we do need a new one.” P9_


## Additional Insights<a id="additional-insights"></a>

### 1/ Participants were concerned the feature would not work due to previously encountered challenges/bugs on VA.gov. (P2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 11)

1. The **automated call system** has long wait times and automated loops making it difficult to use. (P2, P9)

   1. Plus, caregivers have challenges with being recognized as having power of attorney, which blocks them from completing actions on behalf of the Veteran on the phone. (P9)

2. **Upload** sometimes does not work or times out. (P3)

3. General challenges **signing in** to VA.gov. (P9)

4. Expects **digital form not to work**, so would Google paper form as a backup. (P3)

5. Has experienced long communication times, sometimes **receiving mailed letters after appointments**. (P8)

6. Quotes

   1. _General frustrations/ “It's definitely, it's a recurring issue enough so that we, you know, seemingly joke that this happens all the time and clearly there's a reason behind it. And honestly I just think the VA doesn't have the staffing that they need or the agencies or the individuals like you all to get all of these things done. I think that they don't appropriately staff and make sure that things are intentionally followed up on and reviewed regularly. I mean, things break, websites break, things happen, but it happens so often with the VA that it's just comical.” P3_

   2. _Call system/ “So contact us if you have questions. Like that's just the main number. So whoever I call might not know what I'm talking about because I've had mixed experiences with calling the number and I might have to wait on hold for two hours. So I probably wouldn't call. I'd probably just suffer through and make an educated guess. And when I call, they can never find the form that my dad filled out to say that I can act on his behalf because he's 95, disabled and blind. So then they have to get him on the phone and it's a whole nightmare. So I would not, I mean, it would have to be like a nuclear war before I would call.” P9_

   3. _Upload/ “A lot of these things just, they simply don't work. There's a lot of frustration when uploading files through the VA in multiple formats. So that's just my 2 cents. And what happens in those scenarios, it's essentially just an error with no way to get help, really. It's just, it doesn't work and there's no one for you to contact or get help with.” P3_

   4. _Digital form broken/ “So I mean the alternate option would be simply, I mean this, this little link here to fill out your form without signing in could be a benefit or I really like the fact that it has the form names right up here. I don't know if I can highlight that or not. No, but just right here underneath the bold header because it has happened before. If this website doesn't work or the links aren't connecting right, then I can go back up here and I can Google those form names and then I can go print out or utilize Adobe and fill in what I need to fill in. And then my time hasn't been a complete waste on this page because I have learned something and I'm walking away with something that I need.” P3_

   5. _Missed appointments/ “Maybe if there's an option to not have things mailed because I know how long it takes the VA to mail things. Digital forms would be, would be better. \[Communication preferences essentially.] Yeah, I just know that like I get appointment reminders for appointments that have been like two months past or like, yeah stuff like that. So if, if there's a way to be more efficient and not risk things going missing in the mail, I would prefer, you know, different comms options.” P8_

### 2/ There were several pieces of feedback on VA.gov web experience and forms.

1. Feedback on the form elements;

   1. Noticed that the **step bar was not moving** and therefore ‘served no value’.

   2. Thought the **address input was for military bases only** due to the checkbox at the top.

   3. Wanted the ability to **select communication preferences** when entering contact information.

   4. **No idea what the ‘VA file number’ is** or how to find it.

2. Pie in the sky feature requests from users included;

   1. **Chat feature** to ask VA questions or directly talk to their representative.

   2. **Navigation that follows the user** down informational pages.

   3. **Caregiver accounts** linked to Veteran information to complete tasks on Veterans behalf.

   4. **Two-way communication options with representatives** on VA.gov (such as discussions with their doctors).

   5. Ability to **change the language** of VA.gov for their partner's language needs (Chinese).

   6. A way to **access a completed document** later on VA.gov.

   7. A **copy of the completed form** sent to their email.

3. Quotes

   1. _Chat feature/ “In addition, like right, maybe it could be here too to accompany the phone number or maybe some kind of text chat option with Brian.” P11_

   2. _Caregiver accounts/ “I think the only thing would be, and I know I've, so I've done a few of these before and I've talked about like how it would be really great to have like a login for the caregiver if the caregiver doesn't necessarily have like a, a Veteran, like a va.gov login themselves or is someone representing the, the Veteran. So like if I was just a military spouse and didn't have, you know, va.gov access instead of having me sign in under my dad's account or my husband's account, having like a secondary thing so that you, so that like you as the caregiver can sign in would be kind of nice. But I know that's like a bigger thing and not just for this project.” P8_


## Recommendations<a id="recommendations"></a>

### Disruptive to Task Completion

1. Evaluate the experience to set expectations with users that this is not a digital submission process.

   1. Paying close attention to;

      1. The Form start, Review step, and Next step pages.

      2. Use of button language and step tracker on the Review step.

2. Evaluate the organization selection feature to help users be more confident in the why and what behind their selections.

   1. Consider exploring;

      1. Organizational benefits.

      2. Limiting or highlighting recommended options.

      3. Explaining organizational vs representative level support.


### Content & Design Improvements

1. Create a clear delineation between free and paid representatives on the landing page.

2. Provide a list of required information on the Form start page.

3. Provide explanatory copy on the ‘Claimant information’ page as to what an ‘Accredited representative’ is or provide a ‘Friend’ option.

4. Provide an explanation on what a VA file number is and how to find it.

5. Provide explanatory information on how releasing Veteran medical information works if the Veteran is not applying.

6. Provide additional content explaining that the address change applies to the claimant not the Veteran.

7. Explore options to better explain how the 21-22 is a limited power of attorney.

8. On final steps, make clearer that the Veteran is not being asked to submit, but the representative is.

9. Provide representative email and phone number on the final page.

10. _Find a Representative:_ Evaluate inclusion of reporting incorrect organization and/or no longer practicing representation.

    1. Why? Participants frequently mentioned high turnover of VSOs causing delays in claim processing.


## Next Steps<a id="next-steps"></a>

1. Work with CAIA to update content.

2. Team to explore options to better set user expectations on PDF generation and organization selection.

3. Test updated designs with Veterans and potentially VSOs.


## Further Research Needed<a id="further-research-needed"></a>

- Validate that similar patterns do not come up with finding representation in our next study.

- Track drop off at areas of pain points on live experience.
