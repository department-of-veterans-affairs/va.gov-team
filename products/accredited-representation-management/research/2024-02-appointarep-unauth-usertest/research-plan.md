# Research Plan for ARM Team, Appoint a Representative Form User Test (Unauthenticated), 02/2024<a id="research-plan-for-arm-team-appoint-a-representative-form-user-test-unauthenticated-022024"></a>

## Background<a id="background"></a>

Create a high-quality accessible service or suite of services within VA.gov to serve Veterans in managing their Power of Attorney (PoA) representation and to support the deprecation of the legacy system used to take those actions.

### OCTO Priorities<a id="octo-priorities"></a>

**(Q1 2024) Grow digital submissions.** Focus on the needs of accredited representatives, and the Veterans who work with them: After years of focusing exclusively on Veterans who want to interact directly with VA, we will build tools for Veterans who want to work with accredited representatives, and the reps who support those Veterans. In doing so, we will redirect to VA.gov traffic currently going through eBenefits and Stakeholder Enterprise Portal (SEP).

[Current OCTO priorities.](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C055573C508/p1702505912797899?thread_ts=1702499959.887149\&cid=C055573C508)


### Veteran Journey<a id="veteran-journey"></a>

Veterans, their family members, and caregivers can get the help of a representative at any point in the journey where they are submitting claims. Such as; starting up, taking care of myself, retiring, and aging.

Full [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) for reference.


## Research Goals<a id="research-goals"></a>

- Understand Veteran’s family (such as spouse or dependent) or caregiver motivations for seeking representation, why they selected their representative, and what that experience has been like.

- Understand usability of the **unauthenticated** Appoint a Representative flow (21-22/21-22a forms) on both desktop and mobile devices.


### Outcome<a id="outcome"></a>

- Information on Veteran’s family (such as spouse or dependent) or caregiver  motivations and behaviors surrounding representatives will inform the MVP and future experiences.

- User testing will inform adjustments to the Appoint a Representative flow (21-22/21-22a forms) to improve usability.


### Research questions<a id="research-questions"></a>

1. What prompts Veterans’ family or caregivers to find representation?

2. What has the Veterans’ family or caregiver experience been like with their representative?

3. Do users understand the information shown in the 21-22/21-22a? Is there any information missing?

4. What are users' expectations of the experience?

5. Are there any challenges with using the experience?

6. Are the next steps clear and actionable?


### Hypothesis<a id="hypothesis"></a>

1. Veterans’ family or caregivers understand a representative's abilities, and proactively seek their support.

2. Veteran’s family or caregivers have criteria when searching for a representative to ensure they meet their needs.

3. Users will have an easy time navigating our form through tested patterns and informative content.

4. Users will want to provide full medical and address permissions to their representative so they can receive better support.

5. Users will prefer to use the online form to fill out the 21-22/21-22a in order to reduce error, rather than downloading and filling out on their own.


## Methodology<a id="methodology"></a>

- **Semi-structured interview** / The moderator will ask the Veteran’s family or caregivers a series of questions to learn about their representative selection process and engagement with their representative.

- **Usability testing** / Users will be asked to engage with a live prototype to test usability, understandability of content, and desirability of features.
