# Research Goals<a id="research-goals"></a>

## Veteran & Caregiver Journey

Veterans and their family / caregivers can get the help of a representative at any point in the journey where they are submitting benefits. Such as; starting up, taking care of myself, retiring, and aging.

[Full Veteran journey for reference.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)


## Goal & Outcome

Expand our knowledge of additional tasks, motivations, and challenges Veterans and caregivers have when working with representatives, to inform the Disability Claims Process journey map and future features.

# Research Questions<a id="research-questions"></a>

1. What are Veteran / Veteran family and caregiver motivations for seeking representation?

2. What are their search habits and considerations?

3. What have their experiences been like?

4. Do experiences or approaches differ between Veterans and their family/caregivers?


# Methodology<a id="methodology"></a>

Across three studies we spoke to 24 participants. We asked Veterans and caregivers a **series of questions about their representative selection process and engagements with representatives.**

Participants had to be **actively searching for, or working with, a representative** in the last 3 - 6 months. If a caregiver was a Veteran they had to be filing a claim on behalf of another Veteran.

Perigean, OCTOs research recruitment company, managed the recruitment efforts of our interviews, which occurred from December 2023 to March 2024. [Link to recruitment site.](https://veteranusability.us/)


# Key Findings Summary<a id="key"></a>

1. Understanding Representatives

   1. Participants frequently lacked understanding of representatives, what they do, and how they fit into VA processes. This directly impacted their ability to promptly get support and expectations of representative engagements.

2. Motivations

   1. Veterans and claimants who use representation need help understanding and navigating VA processes, and do not feel equipped to handle the task themselves. This could be due to mental or medical challenges, physical disabilities, peer pressure, lack of time to commit to the task, discomfort with government processes, and many more.

3. Search Approach

   1. Through the search process Veterans and claimants are weighing pros and cons to build confidence in their decision. They’re looking to their peers, online resources, and their local VA and VSO facilities to help support their decision.

   2. The largest challenges when searching for a representative was scattered or inconsistent information, and when calls or emails weren’t returned. This made for a frustrating experience and delayed the Veterans and claimants benefits process.

4. Representative Engagement

   1. Engagement from representatives varies immensely and can make or break a Veteran or claimants experience. Veterans and claimants with a positive representative experience tended to have the representative help them craft complete claims, gather evidence, and help them submit files. While also taking time to be empathetic, listen, and communicate often on updates.

   2. The largest challenge with representative engagement was lack of punctual task completion and long wait or travel times. Which often led to delays, or missed claim deadlines.


# Details of Findings<a id="details-of-findings"></a>

## Understanding Representatives

Participants **frequently lacked understanding of representatives, what they do, and how they fit into VA processes.** This was reflected in many of their motivations, choices, and experiences with representatives.

For this section we’ll only be **focusing on Veteran and caregiver interpretations** of VA processes and terminology that relate to representatives, as well as representatives roles and responsibilities.


### 1/ VA Processes & Policies

Participants were **unaware of many VA processes and policies around representatives**, including:

- Laws and regulations.

- Required forms and processes.

- VA VSO relationship and how representatives fit in.

This led to many questions and **assumptions** on what to expect. Common process questions included;

- What is the difference between the 21-22 and 21-22a?

- Is the 21-22/21-22a required?

- Can I select my own representative?

- How do I change or cancel my representative?

- How much can a representative charge?

- Plus many more …

Due to lack of understanding processes and policies some participants thought that getting a representative was a **requirement of filing their claim, even if they didn’t feel the need for representation.** This audience could very well have self-filed, **but don’t because they think they can’t.** This was typically due to **online information or peer input** either directly or through social media such as Facebook.

> _“He was listed \[on Facebook] as the County VSO, and so I thought, oh, ok, maybe I have to include them on the process. I was not soliciting assistance I was following like a checklist from the VA that said, ‘Go to your nearest VSO’. And I thought, okay, I don't know if that is, is that a VA thing?” P5 Find a Representative Veteran_


### 2/ Terminology

Many participants **didn’t know what accredited representative meant and how it relates to VSOs or attorneys.** Instead participants tended to focus on terms they knew such as VSO, service officer, or attorney. Analytics support this with **VSO frequently in the top 35 search terms on VA.gov.**

They also **wanted information** on what accredited meant, expectations of accredited representatives, and how representatives obtained or lost accreditation.

Participants were split on **whether VSO was referring to the organization, officer, or both.**

Participants who **referred to VSO as an organization** were a smaller segment including:

- VSO employees or volunteers.

- Those who had been supported by multiple representatives in a single organization.

> _“I mean if I'm gonna pick an office or like a VSO to be represented by, I would assume that like if there's some chance that like guy doesn't know enough about my situation or my claim … It would be like, I'm gonna connect you to someone in my office who knows more about this kind of claim or you know how to better help you. And so like getting your team to work on it instead of it just being one person. I feel like that would kind of be the, the way that I would like to see it done.” P8 Appoint a Representative Veteran and VSO employee_

Participants who **referred to VSO as an officer** were the majority, and included those who:

- **Trusted and built a relationship** with their individual officer.

- Had been informed that their representative was **‘exclusive’.**

- Had been **‘assigned’** an individual VSO by a VA facility.

> _“I am your go-to person if you need any assistance so that we can all assist you as a group that, but that's not how they talk. So they talk like they are exclusive and that they, even though they're part of the organization, that they're the only ones that you're gonna be speaking to. So that's how they speak. So maybe they should change the way they talk and the way they make themselves sound so important. So they \[sound like they’re] working within the organization.” P2 Appoint a Representative Veteran Caregiver_

Participants **continuously struggled with understanding claims agents.** Frequently mistaking them for VSOs, claim sharks, or simply not knowing what they are, or that they’re a paid option.

Participants had **very few questions or concerns about attorneys.** The only question that came up frequently was if they were **all** paid.

> _“I always thought a claims agent was a VSO, unless we’re talking about claim shark organizations, didn't realize they were separate. Didn’t realize they could charge. I’ll call them “claim sharks”. I thought it was talking about a VA claims agent. I’ve heard about them being predatory towards Veterans. I know dozens of Veterans who have used claim sharks, so they had to resort to paying these agencies to assist them with their claims. They were happy to finally get claims submitted and approved, but had to pay.” P2 Find a Representative Veteran_


### 3/ Roles and Responsibilities

Many participants were **unsure what roles and responsibilities representatives have.** Common questions included;

- What benefits can each representative type provide? **Is there a difference?**

- **When and how** do I reach out to a representative?

- **What benefits** can representatives help me with?

- My local VSO is **more than a beer and bingo hall?**


### How might we …

1. Provide documentation for Veterans and claimants that **effectively communicates** what to expect throughout VA processes, clarifies their rights, and explains the role of representatives **in a language that they relate to?**


## Motivations

There is an additional task Veterans and caregivers consider when deciding to file a claim, and that is deciding **how to file their claim**. Altering the Disability Compensation Journey to be:

- Hear about disability compensation claims

- Decide to file

- **NEW Decide how to file**

Why file with a representative rather than do it themselves? It’s because Veterans and caregivers **need help with a task they cannot complete themselves.**


### 1/ Understanding Available Benefits

Participants were looking for support in understanding:

- **All benefits available** through VA.

- **Which** benefits they qualify for.

- If applying will **impact existing benefits.**

> _“No, I understand if you apply for reconsideration or for an additional potential disability benefit that they have the opportunity to open up your current situation. Nobody has said they will. Nobody has said they won't … I'm not trying to be quote unquote a pig. I just would like fair consideration, but I'm concerned about, is it better just to stay with what I have rather than risk that, and potentially get nothing rather than be satisfied.” P1 Appoint a Representative Veteran_


### 2/ Filing Claims Fast and Error Free

Participants felt that the **VAs processes were overwhelming or ‘tricky’** and this caused hesitation and fear of **filling out paperwork improperly.** Representatives ensure they’re ‘going through the proper channels and receiving the full amount of benefits’. **They’re looking for that expert advice.**

> _“I feel like a blubbering fool. I guess I just feel like as I'm saying all these things out loud. It's just like girl. You just lazy like you just all the things, and that's really why I got the attorney, cause I'm like, I don't know what I'm doing. It's not straightforward. No one's helping me. Not that anyone needs to, but still, like it seems so easy for everybody else. But I'm like I don't know what format this is supposed to be, I don't know.” P10 Appoint a Representative Veteran_


### 3/ Time

There were two situations where participants needed representative help surrounding time.

1. I do not have time to **complete this task on my own.**

2. I do not have time to **wait for this task to be completed.**

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/8kuaW6VkDMsGYbRLb4YiGW6SyscGbsnYKKxaiNki9dGUxQdRKQynagbXpj5s-IjgcbFgibkEPLNz-PaXxOoIS38FPMUAiiNysIcQuYAZti0g8MYfvk2eUX-gF7nh-cOf7rH1OrxXDxdAStYuqcXu-uY "Points scored")

**I do not have time to complete this task on my own.**

Completing claims feels like a **‘full time job’.** From hours spent waiting for appointments to gathering and highlighting hundreds of pages of medical records. Filing a claim takes **extra time that some don’t have to give.** Many in this group were younger with full-time jobs.

> _“Every time we go it's a morning or an afternoon and I work, you know, I need to earn money. So it's like time that I can't work because they're only there taking appointments between nine and three, three days a week or some random schedule that if I kept at my job I would be terminated … I have a stack like this thick of his hospital records that the hospital printed it out and it's not in chronological order, it's in order by lab tests, ER visits, admissions, rehab. And then the dogs knocked over the whole pile anyway … And that's still like, that's taken me five hours that I can't work, like just to put his papers in order. You almost need to do this full-time with your life if you want to get anything meaningful out of it.” P9 Appoint a Representative Caregiver_

**I do not have time to wait for this task to be completed.**

Many participants found themselves in changing scenarios that impacted their benefits and livelihoods, primarily;

- Crisis situations (hospitalizations, mental decline, aging, financial insecurity, etc.).

- Claim denials.

Due to these situations this audience could not wait for benefits and were **looking for expedited help from representatives.**

> _“I went to a medical center, and they had to do some digging, but they found my \[medical] study. So I got that into my records at that point, but they still denied me. Don't know a lot more I could have shown that it was done, and when it was done, and it was done while I was still in \[the military].” P10 Find a Representative Veteran_

> _“I was. I was. I was devastated when my claims were denied because I had done. I thought I had done everything right.” P9 Find a Representative Veteran_


### How might we …

1. **Empower** Veterans and claimants who utilize representatives, rather than self-filing, with **information earlier on in the process** on VA.gov?

2. Get representatives **access to claimant information faster**, so they can help **quickly and efficiently** with claims (especially during crisis situations)?


## Search

Searching for a representative is a multi-step task, and more complex than documented in the Disability Compensation Journey today. There are two tasks Veterans and caregivers go through when finding a representative: 

- **NEW Research available representatives**

- **NEW Select a representative and connect, continue until established**


### Search Methods

The most **common search methods** to find a representative was through online resources, VA facilities, peer referrals, and being a VSO member. Two **notable one-off search methods** included:

- Hosting a Veteran Roadshow to attract representatives to their community.

- Referral from an attorney they ‘buy materials from’ to complete their claim.

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/FTLOnDpGeF2cZCmlepPvMHeDq1E-aGj_qM3Z0QwOSlCsKrsc9p-c3_zvHqCBHHftdpajFMvn4vrMrVup800n5Ykqn13T0jI37v8GBp3w3xqUufGIK9Gs7Y3N8Giu0NUVlWBJC7X3TGupeybDRyEaGNs "Points scored")


#### 1/ Online Resources

Many **started or cross referenced** using online resources, with **Google being the most mentioned** resource. Some also mentioned:

- VSO websites

- Veterans affair and hospital websites

- Facebook

- VA.gov

> _“So I did call 1 or 2 of just Google search VSO offices in my area. But after speaking with them I they wanted me to know kind of, I guess they provided more direct help. So if I went to them, knowing specifically what my issues were they would help me organize that and and get that effectively entered. So really wasn't what I was looking for. So I think it was just Google searching and kind of asking around and that landed me on the American Legion.” P2 Appoint a Representative Veteran_

**Online Resources - VA.gov**

Only five participants had **actively used VA.gov** (either [eBenefits](https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/vso-search) or [OGC](https://www.va.gov/ogc/apps/accreditation/index.asp)) for representative information. Two had heard of the options on VA.gov but had not used them. The rest had **never considered VA.gov as an option** for representative information typically because they had not considered it, or it hadn’t crossed their mind as an option.

> _“Initially, no. 'Cause I didn't, I didn't really know if that that resource was available. It wasn't until I did have like, some friends refer me to VA.gov I was like, oh really? Like I, I thought I needed to like kind of go out of that. So that wasn't initially, no, I didn't really think about that.” P11 Appoint a Representative Caregiver_

> _“I didn’t know that was available. I don’t recall seeing that on the website.” P7 Find a Representative Veteran_


#### 2/ VA Facilities

Almost half of participants went to their state or county VA facilities for representation from a VSO. Typically this was **connected to their medical visits and was a recommendation** by the facility, their doctors, or in their military discharge instructions.

_Note: Many assumed that VSOs in VA facilities were VA employees, and that they were ‘assigned’ a VSO by VA._ 

> _“Within a month after I was discharged. They they they asked me just to call, make an appointment at the local VA hospital which was about driving time with traffic about a 2 hour drive each way. And  I think they they I think I was probably assigned to you know, this is this is the VSO that's available, and I was automatically assigned. I think, I'm sure, from the VSO person at that time.” P9 Find a Representative Veteran_


#### 3/ Peer Referral

Many reached out to their peers for referrals, **which included not only personally known peers**, but also;

- Peers online through Veteran and caregiver Facebook groups.

- Their local VSO chapter communities.

- Veterans they met while waiting at the local VA facility.

- Friend’s wife’s cousin’s husband.

> _“I'm on some Facebook group pages, or whatever Facebook pages for Veterans and their claims and all that. And someone on there said that they had success with this particular attorney. So I reached out to them and went from there. So reached out to the attorney on the recommendation of this stranger on Facebook.” P10 Appoint a Representative Veteran_


#### 4/ VSO Member

Some participants were VSO members which **included volunteers and VSO employees.** Since they **already have a relationship** with the VSO that was their default when selecting their representative.

When selecting their VSO they tended to focus on the VSOs that were **most responsive, they related to, or were at their local VA facilities.**

> _I do a lot of other events and stuff with them \[WWP] and I, out of all the like organizations that I've either volunteered with or like interacted with, I just feel like at least the people that work in our area in \[city] like I'm very comfortable with them. Like it seems like they do a decent job of screening their people. So I, I went with something that I knew, I know a lot of people recommend DAV and stuff like that and I've never had a bad experience with them. I've just never really interacted with them much.” P8 Appoint a Representative Veteran Caregiver_


### Search Criteria

When asked, there was **not a list of strict requirements** that participants were looking for when considering a representative. Instead they **weighed the pros and cons of each representative to improve the confidence in their decision.** There were four themes we saw frequently:

1. What do my **peers** have to say?

2. Do I prefer to meet the representative **in-person or remotely?**

3. Do I **keep or change** my current representative?

4. Am I open to **paid** representative options?


#### 1/ Peers

Veterans and their caregivers look to their peers to provide them **trusted guidance.** Peers provide referrals, information on processes, second opinions, and emotional support. **Many participants' decisions were based on their peers' prior experiences** and they weigh their peers' highs and lows in their personal decisions.

> _“I was looking for something more personal where I could actually like get in like a local guy's office … I wanted somebody that maybe somebody had an experience with that I could say, I could sit down and they could say, hey, he represented me and I know this guy and I know how much of a fighter he is.” P5 Appoint a Representative Veteran Caregiver_


#### 2/ In-person or Remote

Most participants **preferred to meet their representatives in-person**, especially during the first meeting to **build trust**. They want to see if;

- They feel the representative is **trustworthy**.

  - Several felt that meeting in-person would reduce the amount of ‘swindling’ or illegal actions.

- The representative's workspace is **clean and organized.**

  - Some commented on the bar or restaurant-like nature of their local VSOs and how it impacted their trust of the quality of their service.

There’s also the aspect of logistics and having a local representative makes it easier to;

- Drop-off or sign paperwork.

- Share a time zone.

- Ability to ‘drop in’ in case they’re not answering the phone.

**Once a connection was established**, many were comfortable switching to a remote communication method such as phone or Zoom.

> _Because I met with her once before, face to face, and it just seemed more personal personal rather than quote unquote business on the telephone. It seemed like she cared. It didn't seem to me like you know. She wanted to hit a grand slam for me, and promised the world she she wanted to do what was right, and I told her that's all I wanted to do. So you know, I thought that was that was good … I just felt that the personal discussion I had before went very well and I trusted her.” P1 Appoint a Representative Veteran_

When participants **only had digital communications** there were some additional aspects needed to build trust. Such as having a photograph of the representative and their information on official government or VSO websites. Digital communications specifically were helpful for those who needed to contact the representatives **after hours** due to their job or having household responsibilities during the day.

**For some there was no preference**, they simply wanted help, and this question did not sway their decisions in any way.


#### 3/ Changing Representatives

Several participants had a representative and had to **make a decision** on whether they were going to continue with their representative or not. Many in this group were considering **changing to paid representation.** Reasons for changing included:

- They were **recently denied** and wanted to work with someone new.

- Their representative is **no longer available** and the new representative is not as helpful.

- **Moved** and do not have a VSO location in their area.

- **Don’t realize** they’re currently being represented by a representative.

> _“I found out that well, I was assigned American Legion when I left the military.  and I worked with them, and then, when I moved to \[state]. I knew, and I found out in advance that that DAV is stronger in \[state]. So I switched you know, gave the legal representation to DAV, and I've never been able to talk to them. When you call their number. It's always busy. So anyway, that's the situation I have with those VSOs.” P9 Find a Representative Veteran_

> _“That's just where it came from. When I did my first filing. I had no idea that the DAV. Was even involved. I thought that it was just the Veteran Service Commission.” P8 Appoint a Representative Veteran_

> _“I don’t recall selecting one (a VSO), but I found out I enlisted with American Legion.” P4 Appoint a Representative Veteran_


#### 4/ Paid Options

Participants who were considering paid representation saw it as a way to **increase speed and accuracy of their claims process.** Participants typically fell into two categories:

- Only considering paid **from the start (disability claims).**

- Now considering paid **due to long process times or denials (decision reviews).**

> _“When I got the denial, I still haven't heard from anybody from the DAV. That was what 2 months ago, a month and a half ago. So it's like whatever I said. I hate the fact that I should have to pay out of my pocket for benefits that are owed me, you know, and so, but I mean, I guess if I want to see anybody whatsoever. That's what I have to do. So that was my experience with the DAV. They were not helpful. They, the the service officers through the state areas only were not helpful. So everybody that said that they're here to help did not help.” P3 Find a Representative Veteran_

Some participants were **angry they even had to consider paid representation** to obtain benefits they need. For those that felt this way paid options were not a consideration when looking for a representative and did not impact their decision.

> _“I'll just be very blunt with you, it makes me furious to think that I have to pay someone to get help with the very basics of the VA. It makes me really angry to think that the military is the reason that my husband is challenged and quite literally messed up the way that he is. And for me to have to or to not have that support offered back through the military community through the VA hospital, it really infuriates me. I do know people who have used paid help …  when it comes down to it, I just think that's absolutely ridiculous that I would have to lose money to get help that I feel like he's very much earned and should be given.” P3 Appoint a Representative Caregiver_


### Search Challenges

Searching for a representative came with **several challenges**, which impacted participants ability to get representation, **causing delays and frustration**. The top three challenges were:

- Participants were **unsure where or who to go to.**

- No one **would meet with them.**

- **Bad data** encountered.

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/-GCpIuqbS2cFFRmyKl_pXUz1UZM790uBbZ3PHWIzG1vdzvQ0JuZpBfT8EPpPnm9gIxKZ3K7g2vttQ5Z0cmNowf-rNWSRPqarZU1K37T53Fwl2IM-sLSPB5l_Czk-3mPpjX4Y-nkE0pxJPRvJbXNOTCE "Points scored")


#### 1/ Unsure Where to Go

Information on representatives is **fragmented across several resources,** including: the internet, VA facilities, representative websites, social media, etc. This causes **confusion on where to go and who to speak to.**

**This challenge was shared across all search methods.**

> _“At this level, you're really just looking for information and you don't know what you don't know. So if you don't have friends in the Veteran community that can help you out or the caregiver community, it just feels really, really alienating and it definitely has given us a feeling that the VA just simply doesn't care and that you almost have to find ways around the system to get the help that you actually need.” P3 Appoint a Representative Caregiver_


#### 2/ No One Returned Their Calls

Several participants attempted to get ahold of their county VSO or a VSO they found online, but **no one returned their calls.** This caused delays in filing claims, which **some attempted for years without success.**

There were some **unique cases** where Veterans couldn't get a representative to come to their rural locations or work with them remotely.

We also had one participant who was denied representation but **couldn’t understand why due to memory loss.** They saw no path forward for their situation.

> _“So that's how it started. So then I tried to contact the county office. but I could not. I couldn't get them to contact me back at all. I left messages. All kinds of things. Never got a response. Then I called them literally the week before Christmas, and they answered on the second ring, and I was totally shocked.” P4 Appoint a Representative Veteran_

> _“I have a really hard time with some veteran service officers and some veterans assistance personnel, not just with the VA, but with the like American Legion, and VFW. So on Linkedin they're like, Oh, we did this crap and everything else. No one's help, no one's help, you know. We're always there for you. We're willing to do anything to do it, I said, well, you know what. Come here, come 500 miles in a direction no one will help us. So that's very frustrating. So this is the first person who's ever willing to help us in this area, which is stupid, and I don't care for a small number. That's supposed to be that the point is you're supposed to be there. Don't say you're gonna help, and then don't help.” P2 Find a Representative Veteran_


#### 3/ Bad Data

While online, some participants ran into **incorrect representative contact information** which **negatively impacted their trust** in the information due to being unable to contact the representative. Typically this was mentioned in relation to VA.gov. While this was a smaller group of five, it is notable for future developments.

> _“I tried my first two years and never got one successful answer. I stopped using it for that reason and went to other means. On VA.gov I haven’t tried in two plus years because of the frustration before. So I don’t use it out of frustration and I have an avenue now I’m working on.” P2 Find a Representative Veteran_


### How might we …

1. Ensure that information regarding representatives is **easily accessible** to Veterans and claimants in **areas where they typically seek guidance** (focusing on analytics and participant feedback)?

2. Put all information about representatives **in one place across VA entities** to make it easier for Veterans and caregivers to find?

3. Provide Veterans and claimants an **easy to use, informative, and reliable** list of accredited representatives to support them with their claims?

4. Provide **clear communications on statuses and next steps** when completing VA processes in relation to representation?


## Representative Engagement

Representatives will stick with Veterans and caregivers for much of their claims process, and frequently communicate with them on claim updates. The steps of the journey in which representatives engage are:

- Build a case

- Gather records

- Submit claim

- Get notifications

- **NEW Receive updates from representative**

- Interpret decision

- Fight for more


### Representative Engagement Process

Of the 24 participants, 20 were working with or had previously worked with a representative, 4 had not. For this next section we’ll **only be reviewing the 20 that had representative engagement.**

Of the 20 participants we spoke to there were **four levels of support** we saw and support varied by task;

1. Completing the 21-22/21-22a.

2. Advising on building a claim and evidence.

3. Completing forms.

4. Gathering evidence.

5. Submitting the claim.

6. Following-up on claim status.

_There were three participants we could not assess the level of support they were receiving from their representative._

We found that the **more hands on a representative was, the more positive experience the participant had.** It wasn’t just their activities though that made a good representative. There were **several soft skills** that helped improve the experience and relationships between participants and their representatives:

- **Taking the time** to set realistic expectations and answer all their questions.

- Using the Veterans **preferred means of communication.**

- Being **punctual** in communications and actions.

- Keeping the Veteran **up to date during the entire claims process.**

- **Successfully** aiding them in obtaining benefits or **helping in cases of declined benefits.**

> _“She's 2 hours away … She is going to go out of her way to help people, and actually make the travel and drive and everything else that was really great, and it's made it so much easier because you can ask a question. Get an answer, and she's willing to help and do the work for you, and she'll come back to you with questions or things she needs, or whatever, get some clarification. So it's been a very nice.” P2 Find a Representative Veteran_


### Representative Engagement Challenges

The top two challenges that participants encountered when working with a representative were;

- **Lack of representative support.**

- **Long travel and wait times.**

Two notable challenges included;

- Inconsistent VSO support and knowledge.

- One participant's representative was fired for misconduct.

#### 1/ Lack of Representative Support

The biggest challenge for participants was representatives **not completing or following up on tasks leading to lost or delayed claims.** Common dropped tasks included:

- **Not filing Veteran claim documentation** after Veteran brought the documentation to the representative, per request, in person.

  - Or **filing multiple versions** of the same paperwork causing delays.

- **Not responding to calls or emails in a timely manner.** Sometimes taking weeks or months to respond, or not at all.

- Turnover of representatives caused **cases to be lost** and not picked up by others in the organization's office. _(Finding specific to VSOs.)_

> _“And unless you are on top of it, I mean, I'm talking about like aggravating the crap out of these people. They don't respond back. They, like I said, they don't follow up ever. I handed, I, I did the same thing with me. I mean, with some of my disabilities, I, I handed over documentation directly to somebody and promises to follow up. Nothing ever gets done. I mean, nothing ever, ever gets done.” P2 Appoint a Representative Veteran Caregiver_

> _“I think the DAV in \[city] didn't have the capacity I think they were way understaffed and had working too many claims.” P4 Find a Representative Veteran_


#### 2/ Long Travel and Wait Times

The other major challenge was VA facilities were not local to the participant causing **long travel times, anywhere from 30 minutes to 4+ hours.**

Once at the facilities many VSOs **did not hold consistent hours or allow pre-scheduled times.** Participants would show between 5:30 - 7 AM in the morning, sign a piece of physical paper, then wait until they were called, which could take until 4 - 7 PM at night. Even after waiting all day **sometimes the participant would not be seen.**

This travel time and wait **is not sustainable for many either due to age, the inability to drive, or holding a day job.**

> _“So it's in person. They have, I wanna say, maybe 2 to 3 days a week that they have open office. And it's a first come first serve. So yeah, you go in. At first couple of times it was. I was really lucky a short wait, and then I was seeing them the the last time I think I was there 5 or 6 hours before I was able to get seen.” P2 Appoint a Representative Veteran Caregiver_

### How might we …

1. Provide representatives with tools to **improve their workflows and decrease time on task?**

2. How might we provide or identify representative options for Veterans and claimants **who cannot travel** on VA.gov?

3. Provide a way for Veterans and caregivers to **report representatives not upholding their accreditation duties** to ensure consistent support?


# Additional Insights<a id="additional-insights"></a>

## Caregiver Considerations

Caregivers and families of Veterans come with **special considerations** when working on benefits and with representatives.

Many took over filing the Veterans benefits because they could **no longer do it themselves.** Primarily this was due to injury or age. This required many to get legal power of attorney and fiduciary in order to represent the Veteran in their lives.

While some caregivers are Veterans themselves, many aren’t, and **do not have in-depth knowledge of VA systems and processes.** Therefore, many joined caregiver groups and communities, who helped them navigate VA systems and complexities of VA. At times they support one another emotionally as well.

**Not all caregivers are family or related to the Veteran.** Sometimes friends help when the Veteran has no family to lean on. This causes some confusion as there are not many options for non family Veteran caregivers in our interfaces and information.

> _“The reason I took it over is because my dad can't, he does not know how to do all that … And sometimes that can, can be time consuming for them to find the right people to get the right answers. And then when you have vets, my dad is 93 when they don't, you know, drive anymore and they're not mobile anymore.” P1 Appoint a Representative Caregiver_


## VA Process Feedback

**1/ VA Processes Take Too Much**

Many commented that VA processes **require too much information and take too long.** Some commented that at times it **felt purposeful** as though VA was attempting to hinder their ability to get benefits. Some had been trying for **months, years, or multiple decades to get benefits.**

> _“But it blows my mind when I am talking to his army buddies about what we've done and then, you know, trying to guide them through it 'cause they don't have a spouse or a parent or whomever to, to help them. But just seeing like what, how little they actually comprehend about the process and the fact that the process is, this is my opinion, the process isn't made to help you. It's not spelled out to make it easy for you. It's my opinion that the way the process is laid out right now is to hinder you at some point.” P3 Appoint a Representative Caregiver_

**2/ Challenges with Phone Systems**

Some commented on challenges with the phone systems. Specifically that they **end up in ‘automated loops’** with no path forward, or the person on the phone **doesn’t know what the claimant is referring to**. This led some to travel to VA facilities to get questions answered rather than pick up a phone.

> _“So contact us if you have questions. Like that's just the main number. So whoever I call might not know what I'm talking about because I've had mixed experiences with calling the number and I might have to wait on hold for two hours. So I probably wouldn't call. I'd probably just suffer through and make an educated guess. And when I call, they can never find the form that my dad filled out to say that I can act on his behalf because he's 95 disabled and blind. So then they have to get him on the phone and it's a whole nightmare. So I would not, I would, I mean it would have to be like a nuclear war before I would call.” P9 Appoint a Representative Caregiver_
