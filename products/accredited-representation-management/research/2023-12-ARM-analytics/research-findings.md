# Research Goals<a id="research-goals"></a>

## Veteran Journey<a id="veteran-journey"></a>

Veterans can get the help of a representative at any point in the journey where they are submitting benefits. Such as; starting up, taking care of myself, retiring, and aging.

[Full Veteran journey for reference.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)


## Goals<a id="goals"></a>

Holistic view of representative ecosystem encompassing, Veteran/claimant demographics, claim submission analytics, and web performance.


## Outcome<a id="outcome"></a>

Information will be used to support qualitative research findings and team product decisions.


# Methodology<a id="methodology"></a>

1. Submitted PA\&I requests for data around Veterans, representatives, and claim submissions.

2. Gathered data from publicly available reports on VA.gov and Census.gov.

3. Requested submits of the 21-22/21-22a and associated documents from the VBA team.

4. Reviewed analytics on Google Analytics.

_Note: Data available to us is scattered, and hard to correlate at times. There are gaps in information, and several questions we were unable to answer in this study._


# Key Findings<a id="key-findings"></a>

1. Demographics of Veterans with a representative closely match the overall Veteran population, except in race, where Black Veterans are 67% of those with representatives, compared to 13% in the total population.

2. Non-Veteran claimants, forming just 0.1% of representative claims, tend to be younger, particularly in the 35-44 age group.

3. Veterans appear to be actively seeking representative support, with 78% of Veteran claims having a representative on file, while only 4% of non-Veteran claims have a representative.

4. Disability claims are the top claim filed with a representative on file. Other than attorneys, which are two times more likely to support decision reviews than other claims.

5. VSOs are the top representative type, with DAV, AL, and VFW being the most documented organizations. It is notable that attorneys make up 41% of available accredited representatives, and are in the top 10 of digital submissions on QuickSubmit.

6. We have a lot of opportunity to grow in digital submissions with 78% of all claims submitted having a representative on file, but only 12.5% of those were submitted online.

7. We have an opportunity to consider cross flow embedment of the 21-22/21-22a since many packets being submitted have the 21-22/21-22a attached. Including Intent to File and the 21-526EZ form.

8. Both in interviews and web analytics we see a promising desirability for finding representatives on VA.gov. With 21-22 being in the top 15 search terms, and VSO in the top 50. As well as the current landing pages having on par traffic with top navigation links under Disability.


# Veterans & Claimants<a id="veterans--claimants"></a>

## Research Questions<a id="research-questions"></a>

### Veterans<a id="veterans"></a>

1. For FY 2023 (10/2022 - 09/2023), what are the demographics of Veterans with a representative on file? Including their age and race. **_(_**[**_PA\&I Request 2_**](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/vaabdvro/EhvxJXpdbJZLhhyzFvhZZOsBE1lnPcb4Yc-F2PGIWl0obQ?e=7LjyAF)**_)_**

   1. How do Veterans with representatives on file compare to all Veterans? **_(_**[**_National Center for Veterans Analysis and Statistics, Veteran Population_**](https://www.va.gov/vetdata/veteran_population.asp)**_)_**

2. How many Veterans are receiving disability benefits? **_(_**[**_2017, Benefits Received by Veterans and Their Survivors, Census.gov_**](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2021/demo/p70br-175.pdf)**_)_**

3. **_(No answer found.)_** For FY 2023 (10/2022 - 09/2023), of Veterans with a representative on file, how many have 1 representative with limited appointment? 2? 3+?


### Claimants<a id="claimants"></a>

1. For FY 2023 (10/2022 - 09/2023), what are the demographics of claimants with a representative on file? Including their age and race. **_(_**[**_PA\&I Request 2_**](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/vaabdvro/EhvxJXpdbJZLhhyzFvhZZOsBE1lnPcb4Yc-F2PGIWl0obQ?e=7LjyAF)**_)_**


## Hypotheses and Conclusions<a id="hypotheses-and-conclusions"></a>

### Veterans<a id="veterans-1"></a>

1. **Veterans who submit claims with a representative on file will skew older as they need more benefit support.**

   1. **False**/ There was no major difference between all Veterans and those that submit claims with a representative on file. We did see a small increase in ages 35 - 44 and decrease in 65+, which could be for many reasons including; discharge dates, already established benefits, lack of benefit awareness, etc.

2. **Veterans with a representative on file will skew towards an audience who may need more support due to language, location, or socioeconomic barriers.**

   1. **Partially true/** Black Veterans make up 13% of the Veteran population, but 67% of the population with a claim filed with representation. While White Veterans are 79% of the Veteran population, but only 24% of the population that filed with representation. No other demographic had a large difference.

3. **Majority of benefits being requested by Veterans and claimants will be disability compensation.**

4. **Most Veterans will have only one representative on file.**

   1. **Inconclusive**/ Unable to answer by quantitative means.


### Claimants<a id="claimants-1"></a>

1. **No hypothesis, seeking to understand an unknown audience. Some observations to note;**

   1. Claimants who filed with a representative on file are a minority of the audience. Making up only 0.02% of those that filed with a representative on file in 2023.

   2. The audience continues to skew towards a Black audience, but has a larger population of 35 - 44 year olds filing.

2. **Disabled American Veterans, American Legion, and Veterans of Foreign Wars will be the top three VSOs in terms of claims filed.**

   1. **Inconclusive/** We cannot confirm how many claims each group files, but we can see engagement on QuickSubmit which shows DAV, AL, and VFW are the top three VSOs in terms of submissions. Note that Veterans are number two with almost as many submissions as DAV.

### Search Terms<a id="search-terms-1"></a>

1. **Accredited representatives will not be the top search term when it comes to user representative search habits.**

   1. **True**/ We see in both top search terms and qualitative interviews  **_(_**[**_ARM research_**](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/accredited-representation-management/research)**_)_** that Veterans do not typically use accredited representatives, but instead terms they know such as VSO or representative.

### Web Traffic<a id="web-traffic-1"></a>

1. **There is a high desirability of accredited representative support on VA.gov.**

   1. **Positive trends**/ While representative pages aren’t top traffic (ex. disability with 6,167,333 views), the accredited representative landing pages (474,903 views), once combined, do have traffic on par with top navigation disability links “Eligibility for Claims” (596,114 views) and “DIC” (448,908 views).

**NEW: What methods can a 21-22/21-22a be submitted? Of those submission options, what is the number of 21-22/21-22a’s submitted per method in FY 2023? _(Source:_** [**_2024/03 VBA Email_**](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:i:/s/vaabdvro/EaooUbp5yOdKvq0hUGTNdGoBSf2b30ARIuJ37hDQjg_tqw?e=D9gkDR)**_)_**

**Submission Methods**

- Benefits Intake API – Digital mail, the vendors that utilize the BIAPI send the 21-22/21-22a over and it also follows the same path and processing as paper mail once it reaches CMP.

- QuickSubmit – Digital mail, a Veteran or family member fills out the form, it gets uploaded by Veteran, Family member, or VA Business Partner using QS and it goes through the same processing normal paper mail is processed once it reaches CMP.

- Fax – Digital mail, same pathway as paper mail once it reaches CMP.

- Paper mail – mailed in via USPS and processed through our mail facility which eventually ends up in the Centralized Mail Portal where mail automation or claims processors work the claims from there.
