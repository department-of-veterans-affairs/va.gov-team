# Representation Gaps and Digital Opportunities in Veteran Claims

*Insights from the Analytics Findings for ARM Team, 02/2024*

## tl;dr (too long, didn’t read)

Most Veterans use representatives to file claims, but digital options are underused and some groups are overrepresented, pointing to opportunities for equity and efficiency.

## What we did

This study was conducted by the Office of the CTO - Digital Experience (OCTO-DE) and the Accredited Representative Management (ARM) team. It was a mixed-methods analytics review aimed at understanding who uses accredited representatives, how claims are submitted, and where digital processes can be improved.

## Key insights

- **Black Veterans are overrepresented among those using representatives**
  - “Black Veterans are 67% of those with representatives, compared to 13% in the total population.”

- **Most claims are submitted with a representative, but few use digital channels**
  - “We have a lot of opportunity to grow in digital submissions with 78% of all claims submitted having a representative on file, but only 12.5% of those were submitted online.”

  - “87.5% of claims with a representative on file were submitted by mail, 12.5% submitted online.”

- **Digital submission for POA forms is growing fast**
  - “Benefits Intake API and QuickSubmit are 85% of submissions, fax 10%, and paper mail only 5%.”  
    - [See in report (line 548)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/accredited-representation-management/research/2023-12-ARM-analytics/research-findings.md#L548)

- **Veterans are actively searching for representatives and related forms**
  - “21-22 being in the top 15 search terms, and VSO in the top 50.”  
    - [See in report (line 81)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/accredited-representation-management/research/2023-12-ARM-analytics/research-findings.md#L81)

## Between the lines

Disproportionate representation suggests there may be barriers or unique needs among Black Veterans that drive higher use of representatives. The low digital adoption rate is a critical opportunity area for modernization.

## Yes, but

Digital channels are growing, but persistent reliance on mail hints at access, awareness, or trust issues. A one-size-fits-all digital approach may not close the gap for all groups.

## Why it matters

Understanding these gaps supports VA’s goals to improve equity, efficiency, and accessibility (OCTO KRs). Increasing digital submissions can reduce processing delays and administrative workload, while focusing on equity ensures all Veterans benefit.

## What’s next

- Explore reasons behind demographic disparities in representative use.
- Identify barriers to digital adoption and pilot targeted outreach or support.
- Continue aligning digital processes with Veteran needs and preferences.
