# Research Plan for AR Team, VSO - VA Benefits (526ez, 686c, 674) - Interviews, 10/2024

## **Background**

The Accredited Representative Facing (ARF) team, within the Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) Benefits Portfolio at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), supports accredited representatives in their work with Veterans.

Our mission is to create an accessible, modern, and secure online system for accredited representatives. We aim to streamline the use of digital forms, providing a faster and smoother experience for both representatives and the Veterans they serve, ultimately improving the overall VA experience.

### **OCTO priorities**

Objective 1: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.

- Key Result 2: Number of transactions processed during our products have increased by 25%.

- Key Result 3: All new products have a faster transaction time than those they replaced.

- Key Result 4: No transactions accepted by our products have a fatal error.

### **Veteran journey**

Veterans, their family members, and caregivers can get the help of an accredited representative at any point in the journey where they are submitting claims. Such as; starting up, taking care of myself, retiring, and aging.

## **Research overview**

### **Goals**

- Understand how Veterans Service Organization Representatives (VSORs) prepare and file VA compensation disabilities claims ([VA Form 21-526EZ](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-526ez/)) with Veterans.

- Understand desirability of SEP replacement and what features are required for minimal viable product (MVP) adoption.

- Understand VSOR assistive technology (AT) user needs.


### **Outcome**

- Understanding VSORs process, technology use, and additional forms used will help inform features and functionality in the Accredited Representative Portal (ARP).

- Understanding what VSORs expect in an ARP MVP will help inform priorities.

- _Stretch goal:_ Understanding how VSORs prepare and file VA compensation disability claims could inform existing benefits workflows on VA.gov.


### **Research questions**

- What is the VSORs process for preparing and filing VA disability compensation claims ([VA Form 21-526EZ](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-526ez/))?

- How do VSORs support Veterans with managing dependents with VA Forms [21-686c: Application Request to Add and/or Remove Dependents](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-686c/) and [21-674: Request for Approval of School Attendance](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-674/)?

- What technology do they use in their processes?

  - What do they like and dislike about their digital tools?

  - How do AT VSORs use technology to support them?

    - What do they need to be successful with new VA.gov tools?

- What additional forms do VSORs frequently use?

  - Which would they find most beneficial to have digitized?

- If the ARP MVP only included instant acceptance/denial of VA Form 21-22, and submission of 21-686c and 21-674, would that be enough for ARP adoption?


### **Hypothesis**

- VSORs will want a reliable VA tool for processing claims.

- VSORs will want all claims forms, including supporting forms, digitized.

- VSORs will want a way to upload supporting documents.

- VSORs will want a way to review past claims, and track new claims.

- VSORs, including AT users, will prefer to fill out a PDF form, rather than a stepped flow.

- VSORs will be open to ARP adoption without VA Form 21-526EZ.


## **Methodology**

### **Location**
