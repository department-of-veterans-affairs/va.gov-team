## **Research Overview**<a id="research-goals"></a>

### **Veteran Journey**

Veterans, their family members, and caregivers can get the help of an accredited representative or VSO at any point in the journey where they are submitting claims. Such as; starting up, taking care of myself, retiring, and aging.

Full [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) for reference.


### **Goals**

- Understand how Veterans Service Organization (VSO) representatives prepare and file VA compensation disabilities claims ([VA Form 21-526EZ: Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-526ez/)), as well as dependent VA Forms [21-686c: Application Request to Add and/or Remove Dependents](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-686c/) and [21-674: Request for Approval of School Attendance](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-674/) with Veterans.

- Understand desirability of SEP replacement and what features are required for minimal viable product (MVP) adoption.

- Understand VSO representative assistive technology (AT) user needs.


### **Outcome**

- Understanding VSO representative processes, technology use, and additional forms used will help inform features and functionality in the Accredited Representative Portal (ARP).

- Understanding what VSO representatives expect in an ARP MVP to help with prioritizations.

- _Stretch goal:_ Understanding how VSO representatives prepare and file VA benefits could inform existing workflows on VA.gov.


### **Research Questions**<a id="research-questions"></a>

1. What is the VSO representatives process for preparing and filing VA disability compensation claims ([VA Form 21-526EZ](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-526ez/))?

2. How do VSO representatives support Veterans with managing dependents with VA Forms [21-686c: Application Request to Add and/or Remove Dependents](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-686c/) and [21-674: Request for Approval of School Attendance](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-674/)?

3. What technology do VSO representatives use in their processes?

   1. What do they like and dislike about their digital tools?

   2. How do AT VSO representatives use technology to support them?

      1. What do they need to be successful with new VA.gov tools?

4. What additional forms do VSO representatives frequently use?

   1. Which would they find most beneficial to have digitized?

5. If the ARP MVP only included instant acceptance/denial of VA Form 21-22, and submission of 21-686c and 21-674, would that be enough for ARP adoption?


### **Hypothesis**

- VSO representatives will want a reliable VA tool for processing claims.

- VSO representatives will want all claims forms, including supporting forms, digitized.

- VSO representatives will want a way to upload supporting documents.

- VSO representatives will want a way to review past claims, and track new claims.

- VSO representatives, including AT users, will prefer to fill out a PDF form, rather than a stepped flow.

- VSO representatives will be open to ARP adoption without VA Form 21-526EZ.


## **Methodology**<a id="methodology"></a>

- **Interviews**/ The moderator will ask participants a series of open ended questions to understand process, pain points, needs, and wants.

- **Recruitment Requirements/** Our target audience were 9 VSO representatives, who had recently supported a Veteran with filing a VA compensation claim. With a mix of Blind Veterans of America (BVA) AT, SEP, and non-SEP users.


## **Key Findings**<a id="key-findings"></a>

1. VSO representatives **number one priority is speed and accuracy when supporting Veterans.** This is typically due to extensive time required to complete and research claims, large workloads, or both. VSO representatives **rely heavily on tools to speed up their process.**

   1. For blind VSO representatives, tools that **maintain and promote autonomy through assistive technology (AT) use were critical.**

2. Non VA VSO digital tools have permeated the market with anywhere from 50 - 70% adoption. Due to this, VSO representatives have **expectations and minimum requirements when considering what tools they’ll use as many have alternatives.**

   1. The biggest expectation being that the forms will **pre-fill with available VA data, and will be a section by section digital flow.**

3. The biggest draw to the ARP MVP was the promise of **instant acceptance of all forms into VBMS.** All other options can take hours to days to be uploaded into VBMS, or can be lost.

   1. VSO representatives were open to only having VA Forms 21-22, 21-686c, and 21-674 to start, but also **commonly requested 21-0966 (ITF).**

4. The most mentioned pain point were **PDFs that frequently upload to VA blank and lack accessibility.** If the team goes this route, additional measures are recommended to ensure the tool is reliable and accessible.

   1. The next biggest pain points were **outdated forms and challenges with uploading documents.**

5. Hypothesis answers:

   1. **TRUE/** VSO representatives will want a reliable VA tool for processing claims.

      1. VSO representatives are open to new VA tools that improve their day to day and expect it to be reliable, fast, and secure.

   2. **TRUE/** VSO representatives will want all claims forms, including supporting forms, digitized.

      1. With the most requested forms requested in support of completing VA disability compensation claims and decision reviews.

   3. **TRUE/** VSO representatives will want a way to upload supporting documents.

      1. Not only do they want it, but it is a requirement in order to submit certain forms such as VA Form 21-526ez, which requires several attachments.

   4. **LIKELY TRUE/** VSO representatives will want a way to review past claims, and track new claims.

      1. This is one of their biggest pain points, as it is a time consuming manual process in VBMS, or doesn’t exist at all in their process.

   5. **LIKELY FALSE/** VSO representatives, including AT users, will prefer to fill out a PDF form, rather than a stepped flow.

      1. Most expected the flow to be a digital form and be chunked out by form section rather than be a PDF.

   6. **LIKELY TRUE/** VSO representatives will be open to ARP adoption without VA Form 21-526EZ.

      1. They are open, and mostly drawn to the promise that submitting forms on the tool will lead to instant submission and acceptance into VBMS.


## **Details of Findings**<a id="details-of-findings"></a>

### **About VSO Representatives**

**1/ What are VSO representatives' top tasks?**

The number one task for all participants was **supporting Veterans with VA benefits claims**, primarily disability compensation claims. **This finding is in line with analytics**, with 97.7% of  claims submitted with a representative on file in FY 2023 were live compensation claims, which includes disability compensation and decision reviews.

Managers and directors have additional tasks including: **training and managing others, including their and others mental health.**

**2/ What is a VSO representatives number one priority?**

A VSO representatives **number one priority is speed and accuracy when supporting Veterans.** This is typically due to extensive time required to complete and research claims, large workloads, or both.

Singularly accredited national VSO representatives commented that **one of their biggest tasks is researching and gathering evidence** to determine how medical conditions are service-connected through discussions with Veterans and online research.

While county VSO representatives frequently mentioned their **lack of time due to large workloads**. Two examples included:

- 11 VSO representatives per 800 - 1,000 new monthly claims, plus follow-ups, walk-ins, and in process claim tracking.

- Four VSO representatives for a population of 25,000 Veterans and their family.

We have heard similar feedback previously from county VSO representatives at the NACVSO conference.

**3/ VSO representative tools.**

Understanding what tools VSO representatives use today both within and outside the VA ecosystem can help us better understand expectations of future products. **Knowing this can help increase chances of adoption for ARP.**

**VA tools for VSO representatives**
| Tool  | Used for | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Adobe Acrobat (Not a VA tool) | Viewing and editing VA PDF forms | Only reliable program to edit PDFs. Some pay out of pocket for the tool, as it is not provided by VA or their organizations. |
| CAPRI | Viewing VA medical records | Only heard use of the tool from BVA. All others mentioned they did not have, but would like, access. |
| QuickSubmit | Submitting documents to VA | The tool is experiencing major delays, with turnaround times increasing from 2–3 days to 3–6 weeks, and no explanation from the VA. |
| Share | Viewing Veterans POA status | Mention of this tool was rare, and this tool is being sunset. |
| VBMS | Viewing Veterans VA medical records, service history, claim history and status | Most widely used VA tool. Requires PIV card, which not all VSO representatives have, and can limit their ability to support Veterans. Use bookmark and filter features to manually track claims. |

**VSO representative form fill / CRM tools**
| Tool | Total users | Customer management | Form completion | Notable features |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |

_\*Percentage is reported users divided by total VSO representatives in Find a Representative (7,852) as of 11/2024._

The accredited representative teams are seeing similar permutation of tool use with our VSO representative panelists as seen in the attached. Results are based on 103 responses from general population VSO representatives in the OGC database.

_Audience size of \~7,900 VSO representatives with 103 responses from general population gives us a confidence of 95% with a +/- 10% variance. Example: Tyler Tech’s market share (44.7%) can vary anywhere from 34.7% - 54.7%._

**4/ VSO representatives and assistive technology.**

- **Participant assistive technology (AT) use.**

  - One participant relied on JAWs, the other on Zoom Text and Apple Accessibility.

  - Our participants' reasons for selecting a specific screen reader was either because it was government provided or was the most suitable option for their disability.

- **VSO representatives supporting blind Veterans.**

  - Veterans receive training at 13 nationwide Blind Rehabilitation Centers. During their time at these centers, they learn to use technology to navigate their disabilities. The primary screen-reading technology used by the VA is VoiceOver.

  - As there are only 13 locations, many Veterans have to travel far, or can only receive remote support.

  - Once a Veteran leaves the Blind Rehabilitation Center, BVA VSO representatives are cleared to submit blind Veterans claims.

- **The most important aspect of any digital tool to a blind VSO representative is maintaining their autonomy.**

  - Autonomy is maintained through features that do not rely on sight. Such as eSignatures and fully accessible digital forms and experiences.

  - Many older VA tools and PDFs are not currently accessible making it difficult for blind VSO representatives to support Veterans. They have come up with workarounds, such as relying on partially sighted co-workers to get around the challenges.

- **Big wish is for a dedicated AT contact center help line to support blind users of VA.gov.**


### **21-526ez Process**

**1/ VSO representatives start the 21-526ez process with understanding the Veterans situation, setting expectations, and submitting VA Form 21-22.**

1. **(Optional) Make an appointment**. Due to high caseloads some VSO representative offices require Veterans to make appointments. During scheduling, Veterans are typically provided an overview of what to expect, including what documents to prepare and bring to their appointment.

2. **Understand the Veterans current situation.** VSO representatives will confirm the Veterans identity through state IDs, DD-214, and VBMS. They also ask questions about the Veterans:

   1. Current or previous POA

   2. Current or previous VA benefit claims

   3. Dependent information

   4. Medical conditions

   5. Service history

3. **Set ground rules and expectations.** Including how VA claims processing works and what to expect. As well as expectations of both the VSO representative and Veteran.

4. **(Optional) Create a Veteran CRM profile.** If a VSO representative has a CRM software they will create a Veteran profile to pre-fill forms.

5. **Complete and submit VA Form 21-22.** Forms are completed by paper, Adobe Acrobat, or through the VSO representatives CRM system. VA Form 21-22 is typically submitted alongside VA Form 21-0966 or 21-526ez.

**2/ VSO representatives will then gather all supporting evidence, medical records, and additional VA forms before submitting. Much of this documentation is on the Veteran or non Veteran claimant to obtain.**

1. VSO representatives primarily want to **understand the Veterans condition, how the condition is service connected, and evaluate the strength of the evidence connecting the two**. In order to do this they primarily obtain medical records, service records, and statements.

   1. Medical records from when the Veteran was in active duty, or from VA facilities, are available to VSO representatives in VBMS or CAPRI to view.

      1. Private records can be obtained by the VSO representative using [VA Form 21-4142: Authorization to Disclose Information to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-4142/), but **almost all preferred the Veteran obtaining their own  private medical records**. This was due to concerns that completing VA Form 21-4142 would delay the claim either due to processing time or providers being unaware of the form's purpose.

      2. It was a common theme that **many Veterans came to VSO representatives with aches and pains with no diagnosis**. Knowing their claim could be denied they strongly encourage the Veteran to receive a medical diagnosis prior to filing.

   2. Service records were either obtained with [DD214](https://www.va.gov/records/get-military-service-records/) or via VBMS.

   3. The most common statements gathered were:

      1. [21-0781: Statement in Support of Claimed Mental Health Disorder(s) Due to an In-Service Traumatic Event(s)](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-0781/) for PTSD, MST, and other mental health conditions.

      2. [21-10210: Lay/Witness Statement](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-10210/) for ‘buddy’ or ‘battle buddy’ statements.

      3. Nexus letter written by a Veteran’s physician detailing the connection between their current conditions and their military service.

      4. [21-4138: Statement in Support of Claim](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-4138/) became a catch all. Including presenting a full case as to why the VA should accept the claim, personal statements, spouse statements, buddy statements, describing the Veterans current living situation, etc. **If something in the claim needed explaining, this is the form VSO representatives used.**

      5. _Note_: It was a common theme that **many VSO representatives did not want to write statements on the Veterans behalf.** Not only did they not feel equipped to explain another Veterans experience, as many are Veterans themselves, **the statements can be triggering to their own mental health.** For this reason many would ask the Veteran to type out their own statement and provide it to the VSO representative to attach to the claim.

   4. Some notable documentation included:

      1. Court records related to the claim. Example provided was long lasting injury during a car accident while on active duty.

      2. Known toxic exposure sites for PACT Act claims.

      3. Online medical studies to support the claim.

2. There were several situations in which VSO representatives would **expedite a Veterans claim. Such as in situations of financial or medical hardship.** Additional forms that VSO representatives could include to expedite the Veterans claims, included:

   1. [20-10207: Priority Processing Request](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-20-10207/)

   2. [21-2680: Examination for Housebound Status or Permanent Need for Regular Aid and Attendance](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-2680/)

   3. [21-8940: Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability](https://www.va.gov/disability/how-to-file-claim/additional-forms/) or [21-4290: Employment Information in Connection with Claim for Disability Benefits](https://www.va.gov/disability/how-to-file-claim/additional-forms/)

3. VSO representatives would also submit documentation to **ensure that the Veterans dependents and next steps were in order prior to submitting**. Including submitting forms:

   1. [21-686c: Application Request to Add and/or Remove Dependents](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-686c/) which was only included if the Veteran already had, or was anticipating, a 30% disability rating.

   2. [21-0845: Authorization to Disclose Personal Information to a Third Party](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-0845/) to allow spouses and caretakers access to Veterans benefit information.

   3. [21-674: Request for Approval of School Attendance](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-674/) and [21-674b: School Attendance Report](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-674b/) for any dependents close to, or over, 18+ years of age.

   4. [SF-1199a: Direct Deposit Sign-Up Form](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-sf-1199a/) to ensure the Veteran is paid quickly.

**3/ Forms are then completed, signed, and submitted to VA.**

1. To complete forms VSO representatives **typically  either use a CRM form fill tool or Adobe Acrobat**. For those who use a CRM tool they rely heavily on pre-fill features to save time, while those completing by hand can take up to 1 - 2 hours to complete.

2. Signatures are then either captured electronically or on paper.

   1. **High praise for VetPros signature feature.** A Veteran is directed to a secure website where they enter a one time code to access and sign their documents.

3. The 21-526ez form is then submitted with all supporting documentation through the VSO representatives CRM tool, QuickSubmit, fax, or mail.

   1. Some have to send their documents to their headquarters for review prior to VA submission.

**4/ After submission of the 21-526ez, VSO representatives support Veterans by answering questions, guiding on VA processes, and advocating for claim completion.**

- Veterans will frequently reach out to VSO representatives for **assistance with VA communications, C\&P exams, and claim status updates.**

- Some VSO representatives **proactively track all Veteran interactions and claims** in their CRM tool or VBMS. While **others rely on the Veteran to proactively reach out** due to workload constraints.

- If a Veterans claim is not resolved within a timely manner some VSO representatives will submit a Claim Accuracy Request (CAR) or work directly with the VSRs **to have the claim re-evaluated.**

- During the claim processing period VSO representatives do not receive claim status letters, and **have to manually check VBMS for updates.**

- If all goes well most claims take 6 - 8 months to complete, with most expedited claims completed in 30 days or less.

**5/ The two largest pain points specific to the 21-526ez process were claim processing delays and C\&P exams.**

1. Claims were delayed due to many reasons, including:

   1. Internal VSO **review processes**

   2. Veterans Service Representatives (VSRs) **missing critical information** in VBMS

      1. One notable mention. One VSO representative provides a ‘top sheet’ (think a fax cover) that explains where in VBMS to find the Veterans file. Including which PDF, on which page, **so the VSR can easily find medical records.**

   3. Claims getting lost in the queue or **‘lost in a black hole’**

   4. Priority claims **not receiving priority status**

2. Compensation and pension exams (C\&P exams) were frequently **scheduled far away from Veterans** unable to transport themselves typically due to disability or age. Exams were then marked as unattended and the claim denied. VSO representatives commented that they **have to call and negotiate with the C\&P examiners** to reschedule and relocate the Veterans exam to an accessible location.

   1. There were also concerns on accuracy of C\&P exams, and some would review the C\&P exam request to **ensure that the correct disability was being evaluated.**


### **21-686c Process**

**1/ 21-686c Form Use**

- VA Form 21-686c was **most commonly submitted alongside VA Form 21-526ez, or as a standalone**. The form was only used for Veterans **with an existing 30% disability rating** or who were anticipating a 30% disability rating.

**2/ 21-686c Frequency of Use**

- VSO representatives were **split on how often they used VA Form 21-686c.** Frequency ranged from multiple times a day to never. Use was typically associated with the age of their Veteran demographic, as **younger Veterans were more likely to have newborn children.**

**3/ 21-686c Supporting Documents**

- The **most commonly included documents were birth certificates, marriage licenses, and divorce decrees.** Although it was commonly mentioned that the VA does not require these documents, some gathered them **just in case.**

- Notable mentions are **inclusion of VA Form 21-674/674b for dependents 18+ years of age**, and VA Form 21-4138 for any clarifications.

**4/ 21-686c Pain Points**

- **Pain points were few**, with most noting that the form is just necessarily long.

- Two commented that **documenting multiple marriages was difficult.**

- One commented that if the form was submitted with VA Form 21-526ez that it would **sometimes** **get lost in processing.**


### **21-674 Process**

**1/ 21-674 Form Use**

- VA Form 21-674 was **most commonly submitted alongside VA Form 21-686c**, and is only used for Veterans **dependents attending secondary school who are 18+.**

**2/ 21-674 Frequency of Use**

- Most VSO representatives used this form only once or twice a month, with **influxes of submissions around fall school admissions.**

  - **Due to such low usage** there wasn’t much feedback on this form or process.

- One VSO representative mentioned **working with local colleges** to ensure Veterans dependents were receiving benefits.

**3/ 21-674 Supporting Documents**

- The most common attachment was VA Form 21-674b.

**4/ 21-674 Pain Points**

- **Most VSO representatives had no pain points with VA Form 21-674.**

- One wanted the ability to **submit dependents close to the age of 18** so as to not delay benefits.

- One wanted VA Forms 21-674 and 21-674b **to be combined.**


### **VA Process Pain Points**

**1/ One of the largest pain points in the VA benefits process is human error. Whether that’s on the VA, VSO, or Veteran side.**

- VSO representatives commented on the **inconsistency of VSR support**, which can **delay or deny Veterans benefits.**

  - One example is outdated forms, if submitted on an approved digital tool, are allowed to be accepted up to one year after a form is updated. But many VSRs do not know of this law and deny claims due to being submitted on outdated forms. This leaves the VSO representative to either have to resubmit on the new form, or send the law to the VSR to review.

- VSO representatives rely on their VSO(s) for support, training, and up to date information, and **if they don’t provide it, it can impact their ability to do their jobs.**

  - One example was with a VSO representative who was unaware of the option to obtain a PIV to review VBMS, or the ability to submit documents through QuickSubmit.

- There is also a **strong reliance on the Veteran to provide information and documentation about their military and VA experiences.** Which may be inaccurate and can impact their claims.

**2/ The second biggest pain point was the lack of timely communication about the Veterans claim, or communications that were confusing to Veterans.**

- VSO representatives are frequently **manually reviewing VBMS to get status updates on claims**, which is a time consuming process.

- Veterans also **frequently reach out to the VSO representatives for clarification on VA communications** due to either being confused by the content or the timing of the letter. Since some communications are so delayed, they are repeating topics that the VSO representative has already completed with the Veteran.


### **ARP Features & Adoption**

#### **Attractors (Adoption)**

- The number 1 biggest attractor to ARP for VSO representatives is the **instant acceptance of forms directly into VBMS.** Which not only includes VA Form 21-22, but all forms available in ARP, so they are **not delayed or lost in processing.**

- When participants were asked if they’d adopt the tool they were split on either being a resounding 100% yes, or ‘it depends’.

  - For the ‘it depends’ participants they would only adopt if the experience was **as fast, secure, and reliable as their current tools.**


#### **Expectations**

- VSO representatives had **two main expectations based on their experiences with their current form fill tools (which includes SEP):**

  - **The forms will pre-populate** with Veterans information from the VA.

  - The forms will be a **digital form broken out by form section.**

    - Example: VA Form 21-674 has 6 sections, the VSO representative expects to see 1 section at a time, for a total of 6 screens or groups of questions.

- Additional **SEP user expectations based on current functionality** included:

  - **Instant acceptance of forms into VBMS.**

  - **Inclusion of confirmation messages and numbers**, so they can track submissions.

  - **VA Form 21-526ez Specific**

    - Ability to choose VA medical center in form flow.

    - Form flow being ‘10 clicks or less’.

  - **VA Form 21-686c Specific**

    - Pre-population of dependent information into form.

    - No requirement of additional documentation.

  - **VA Form 21-674 Specific**

    - VA Forms 21-674 and 21-674b combined into one flow.


#### **Wishlist**

- The top 2 most requested additional features to be added to ARP MVP were:

  - Addition of **instant Intent to File.**

  - Ability to **track Veterans previous and in progress claims.**

- There were several notable mentions, including:

  - **Dedicated phone lines** for support with Veterans to help with login, dependent benefits, and for **blind Veterans navigating using AT.**

  - Provide documentation to VSO representatives that they can **share with Veterans on how to request representation on VA.gov.**

  - Add disability compensation claims and decision reviews.

  - Ability to obtain Veteran eSignatures without requiring VA.gov login.

  - Integration into current tool (VetPro).

  - Ability to see Veterans current POA status.

- 1 additional **SEP user request based on historical functionality** included:

  - **Ability to re-open and escalate claims.** This used to exist, and was removed from SEP functionality. We also heard this as a request from non-SEP users.


#### **Detractors (Pain Points)**

- PDFs were the most **universally mentioned pain point**. There were several issues, including:

  - Appearing blank in VA systems if not edited with Adobe Acrobat.

  - Not being accessible by screen readers or by tabbing navigation.

  - Incorrectly generating from form fill programs such as SEP and VetPro.

  - Field restrictions, and no overflow pages.

  - Not successfully downloading from VA systems.

- A close tie for second were 3 major pain points:

  - **Outdated forms** in form generation tools (including SEP, VetPro, and Tyler Tech) causing Veteran claim submissions to be denied or delayed.

  - Challenges with uploading, especially SEP and QuickSubmit, either **failing or significantly delayed with processing.**

  - **Lack of system access to VBMS, CAPRI, and Share** to view Veterans information to support in filing claims.

- Pain points specific to SEP included:

  - **Lack of notifications of POA requests.**

  - Generally slow, and prone to error.

  - Inability to make new user accounts.

  - Veteran experience is cumbersome and difficult to use.

  - **VA Form 21-526ez Specific**

    - Forcing the VSO representative to enter a Veterans statement in the system, even when they feel the Veteran should do so.

  - **VA Form 21-686c Specific**

    - Blocked from completing the form if a Veteran does not have a 30% disability rating.

    - Flow is difficult to navigate if a Veteran has multiple ex-spouses.


## **Additional Insights**<a id="additional-insights"></a>

### **VSO Representative Recruitment Feedback**

- No new findings.


## **Recommendations**<a id="recommendations"></a>

### **General Recommendations**

1. Consider completing an **evaluation of SEP prior to sunsetting** to gather current functionality. Especially if targeting SEP users who have expectations that the new system will work similarly to the old one.

### **MVP Recommendations**

1. **Consider incorporating pre-fill into MVP** to meet parity of SEP.

   - Including pre-filling VA Form 21-686c with dependent information.

   - [Documentation of current SEP pre-fill fields.](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/vaabdvro/EWW7_ngDgARHoXpxJz81gnoBJ8azLvhVnPQsmkDR0Dn3ow?e=uMDXyU)

2. **Consider incorporating ITF into MVP** as it is one of the top used forms, is commonly submitted alongside POA, and is very short.

3. PDF vs digital form

   - **PDF considerations:** Strong need for QA of PDFs from a download, upload, and accessibility standpoint. Consider providing pilot participants with Adobe Acrobat to reduce chances of errors if they have to edit PDFs outside of the tool.

   - **Digital form considerations:** Do not follow VA.gov standards of one question per page. Instead block out the form section by section.

   - **Both:** Provide users with a way to upload documents, if a form requires additional supporting documentation. If the form does not require additional documentation, provide messaging that explains it is not required.

   - **Both:** Provide users with a confirmation message and number once their form is completed to confirm submission success.

4. VA Form 21-686c and 21-674

   - Consider evaluating the existing 21-686c flow in SEP, as **addition of multiple spouses was deemed challenging and unusable.**

   - Consider **combining VA Form 21-674 with 21-674b** as is currently in SEP.

5. Communication

   - Strongly recommend a **strong communication strategy**, outlining timelines, expectations, and next steps for pilot and upcoming pilot users.

   - Consider providing VSO representatives with **documentation they can send Veterans** walking them through how to request representation on VA.gov.

   - Provide in system messaging in cases of **known down time or errors.**

   - Provide **notifications that representatives received a POA request.**

6. AT recommendations

   - **All features need to be accessible with common AT technology**, including: JAWs, Apple, and Voiceover.

   - All features need to be usable **without the need of vision**, including signatures and upload.

### **Post MVP Recommendations**

1. **Consider launching forms in order of** disability compensation claims, decision reviews, supporting documents, and ‘widows benefits’.

2. Form experience

   - **21-526ez:** Consider allowing VSO representatives to upload VA Form 21-686c with the form even if a Veteran does not have 30% disability.

   - **All forms:** Consider allowing representatives to upload a Veteran statement, rather than forcing them to enter it themselves.

   - **All forms:** Consider providing users points in the experience to **upload related documentation**, as is currently in SEP.

3. Consider **dedicated call center support for blind VSO representatives in ARP.**

4. Consider providing VSO representatives with a way to **track in progress claims.**

5. Consider bringing back the ability to re-open and escalate claims.

6. **For forms that are knowingly out of date**, consider sending a cover sheet with the law informing VSRs that the form is acceptable up to a certain time. Provide that time if possible.


## **Next Steps**<a id="next-steps"></a>

1. To be determined based on next steps discussed by the team.

### **Quotes**

**About VSO Representatives**

- And when you say research, what do you mean by research? _“So sometimes you know, if a veteran, I don't know, it says they were at a certain place or something maybe had happened. We like to research maybe the incident, if there's something that was in the papers or things like that. Or if it's a certain condition that they have, maybe other secondary issues, things like that. So like we research either the disability itself or we can research incidents sometimes. The, you know, or the law or the regulations as well.“ P1_

- And as a director, if you had to pick three main tasks of your job, what would they be? _“Probably getting the veterans claim correct would be my primary thing. And the other one is training, training other blind service officers. And the last thing probably would be making sure I take care of my own mental health when I'm doing claims for a veteran because I myself am a veteran.” P3_

- _How many VSOS are in your office currently? We have a staff of 14. Three of those are admins that run our front desk. So approximately 11 … I think it's around 808 hundred to 1000 \[claims] … Because we're not just filing claims in our one-hour appointments. You know what, somebody will call us and say, hey, \[name], I got denied for this. I look it up and go, yeah, that's that's a clear and unmistakable error. And then I'll just file a higher level review right on the spot, you know, things like that.” P9_

- _“It's a little hard when you've got the number of veterans we do and the few number of VSOs that we have. So, but I make every effort to try to help them get everything that they need, whether I do it or they do it, it doesn't matter … So there's four of us basically handling about 25,000 people and their families. So that speed of Vet Pro is really helpful. Really does a lot of help. Does a lot of work for me that I don't have to do multiple times over and over and over again. “ P10_

- _“Just making sure that it's it's accessible for those of us who are blind and visually impaired. It has to be accessible for us to do our job. We do serve a serve a large demographic of veterans like ourselves and we need to be able to do that without the bumps in the road.” P3_

**21-526ez Process Quotes**

- And when you say you review their medical history, are you doing that in VBMS or is there another system that you use? _“It is in VBMS. It is in VBMS. We review that. And also we review if the VA actually puts in their CAPRI records, which are the ones from the hospital, we review the, we review their problem list and compare it to the conditions that occurred in service as well. So that way we can see that there's a continuum of care for the condition, which makes us more likely to submit the correct claim for the veteran and not just throw something like spaghetti on the wall and see if it sticks. We don't do that. We just make sure that the claim is correct when we submit it.” P3_

- _“When I am building veterans files, I don't do that as much anymore 'cause that's a lot of the times handled by our, our front guy. But if I do build a veteran's file, I usually try to, you know, submit as much information as possible. That way it saves a whole lot of time filling out forms in the long run.” P4_

- _“And so, you know, if, if it's a veteran that's utilized the va, you know, we just on the 526ez, we'll list those VA locations. However, if it's only been private records, I will usually have the veteran then go get their medical records. It's always easier for the veteran to retrieve their own records rather than having the VA do it through a 21 -4142 and 4142a.” P4_

- _“So most time gathering would be personal statements, you know, from the veteran, from the spouse, you know, any family or friends that could provide, you know, helpful testimony. Battle buddies, oftentimes that takes a while 'cause it could have been decades since they, they talked to these people last and then medical records, that's evidence gathering.” P4_

- _“We let them know by law it's for service connected disability, they would need to have a diagnosed condition. And then that's not a hundred percent across the board because some of the conditions are not diagnosed when the claim gets to va. And they may be sent for a C\&P exam, but by law it should be a diagnosed condition. And, and preferably, depending if there's a length of time, some continuity of care, you know, that they've seen the doctor been seen for the condition, just to determine that. And then of course, there's the connection that has to be made with the condition and then the service event in order for there to be a nexus. And so those are the things that we discuss with the veteran.” P6_

- _“I always wanna know where they get their treatment from. So if it's va, I'm able to input that into SEP. You know, we can choose the medical center … So I need to know where they're getting treatment from. If they have private treatment, I don't want to do a records request. I want them to get the records for me because it's, it's a lot easier on our end and it's a lot less confusing for the veteran if, if we do records requests, they're gonna get letters that they don't understand.” P7_

- _“If there's explanation needed, we'll use a 4138. So it's just a statement and support a claim. It's a blank form. Sometimes we'll put arguments in there. Other times we will, we have these briefs that we write. They're called informal hearing presentations. And sometimes we'll write mini ones to support a claim. And basically it follows a format of irac IRAC issue rules, application and conclusion. So, you know, we present the evidence, this is why it should be granted, or this is why the, you know, this particular percentage should be there. Here's the applicable regulations. And then here's our final conclusion of what we're looking for.” P7_

- _“I guess, finagle the system a little bit, even with unemployability and PTSD. So if I was to file for PTSD, like when I get to the disabilities list, I'll type in PTSD. The next page after that, it's gonna ask you, ask you two questions. I don't know which one comes first, but it's, do you wanna file a claim for PTSD? I will always mark, no, the reason is, if I was to mark, yes. My next page is basically blank screens of me typing what the Veteran's stress statement was. So I, I hit no and I just upload their stress statement at the end with unemployability.”  P7_

- _“I'm asking them everything from, we're broken down by congressional district, so I'm asking, you know, what town they live in to establish that they're within the congressional district. I'm asking them when they served to get a time period of what we're looking at in terms of not only the things that they think that they want to file for, but if there's other things that are on the presumptive list based upon other service. I'm asking them what disabilities they're looking to pursue. I'm asking them if they have dependents, be it a spouse, minor children, college age children or special needs children. I am asking them to provide their banking information so that we can establish the direct deposit. That's about it.” P8_

- _“Then I have a discussion with them, take representation, scan their information in, do the claim, give them a large education. You know, I like, you know, everybody's different, but I like to give a large education on, you know, the structure of the VA because if you give that upfront, generally they're not confused when they're going to the VA appointment. They're not their VHA appointment vice their VBA contract, you know, C\&P examination. We see that every once in a while. So I kind of break that down. Then I give them an expectation what they, you know, basically what they can expect. The VA is going to pull their records. It's going to pull their with their DD214. It's going to pull their records and pull their medical records, review those, determine if they should request examinations, which generally they do, and then make sure that they have their phone on hand to and you know, sometimes it's going to look like spam to go ahead and answer all their phone calls until they get that appointment, get their appointments, go to their appointments. They have to go to their appointments. I get so many questions. Do I really have to go to this? Yes, you really have to go to that.” P9_

- _“4142 and 4142 alpha for requesting records if they didn't bring records in and I know the VA is going to want to see those records. Generally I tell them it's better to go get those and bring them to me. But when that's an issue, then we'll do the 4142. And I just informed them that that just prolongs the claim by a month or so. And the VA, if the VA, they don't send the records to the VA, the VA is going to ask them to go get it regardless.” P9_

- _“Then a lot of them have their medical records with them. Some folks don't. So like, for example, I'll have somebody come in and complain about their back and then I'll say, OK, that's a little too broad. What are we talking here? Sciatica. What? What exactly? And did you see a doctor for it? What diagnosis do you have? So I use the correct terminology on our VA form … Well, you know, I was infantry. My back is killing me. I saw a doc and then I don't have health insurance. Currently they're not even registered with the VA. So we have to totally backtrack and we, we order their medical military medical records so that we could kind of make sense of their pains and what's going on and what could, what that could possibly be. And then we take it from there. And then sometimes they just have to come back once they have a diagnosis because I tell them back pain is very broad. So we need a diagnosis. So we could be a little bit more specific so it could make sense. So we definitely go over everything.” P11_

- _“ And then that claim the veteran must sign himself or herself because it is the initial claim and is required by VA that they signed the first original claim.” P3_

- _“So what we do is we submit, submit the e-mail to the veteran with the form already populated and it allows them on the other end to sign the document electronically. And most of the time I am spending the time teaching the veteran how to sign electronic documents because if they have never gone to a blind rehab center, they don't know how to do those things. So they get a lesson from me on how to sign an electronic document. And it's, it's amazing because they can use voice over, but when they use Voiceover, when they get to the end to where you sign it, they're not able to sign it with Voiceover on. They have to turn it off in order for them to sign the document. Yes, that is the only difference that they have is doing that, which it worked. But there's another way that we can do it to bypass that is that we use finger dot ink and finger dot ink. What it does is that the veteran goes to that website and it brings up what looks like a little calculator with a box at the top of it where you plug in numbers and we put those, they put the number in. I am going to give them the number because I have a QR code that comes to me to give them the number and then that allows them to sign as well.” P3_

- _“So I had mentioned the original claim, so once a veteran has submitted his original him, his or hers original claim, after that we can submit paperwork on their behalf, sign on their behalf. But there are still, there's, there are still exceptions to that. Like we can't do a, a 686c without the veteran that actually, yeah, I, that might have just changed previously we couldn't file a 686c without the veteran signature. And then like for, for next, if kin like documentation, the, you know, the 534 has to be, I believe has to be signed by the, the PO or the claimant 0845 has to be signed by the veteran. But like if we're submitting a claim, an appeal, statements, we can, we can sign on the veteran's behalf. And honestly if, if we can, we, we usually do just because again, if we can prevent the veteran needing to come to our RO or trying to figure out email, you know, we'll just be very clear on what we're doing, we'll let 'em know like, Hey, I'm gonna submit this claim, I'm gonna, you know, sign on your behalf, is that okay? They'll usually give us a confirmation and then I'll, if they have an email, I'll usually send them the confirmation that the whatever has been submitted has been submitted.” P4_

- _“You know, you just, you just get the PDF form offline. Okay. Fill that in, print it off, have the veteran sign it, and then we mail it in too. 'cause all of our stuff has to be screened by our, the headquarters, which is in \[VSO headquarters], and they work in the same building as the \[VSO headquarters] Regional Office.” P6_

- _“We have a, a spot in VBMS. So if we, in the upper left hand corner in VBMS, there's a, a spot called all claims and VSOs it, like right now it says there are documents requiring your attention. So nationwide we have 8,196 documents available and then we filter it per state. So like I'll only filter South Carolina people and then we go and we provide notification that way. So anytime someone gets a rating decision, we send them a letter from our program as well saying, Hey, the VA made a decision, expect some mail here shortly.” P7_ 

- _“Quick submit. Quick submit, yeah. You have to constantly go back in there and see if it was successful. So right now there's issues, there's, I guess the VA allowed, you know, quick submit to be available to everybody, to every veteran, VSO, everybody. So now they're being inundated with all these documents and they can't, they can't catch up. It used to take maybe three or four days for our documents to show up up in VBMS and now it's taking, you know, 10 to 14.” P7_

- _“I've had some troubles with SEP. Oftentimes I can't submit medical records or documents at the same time that I'm submitting a claim, so that's super frustrating. What's the other error that I get? One error, another error? I think the records is probably the biggest thing is, is I, I found since like, oddly enough, it was like probably a little before we got Tyler. So sometime last year for whatever reason, I can't, documents just don't, just don't upload. When I'm, when I'm using it and I'm using, you know, I'm using PDFs, I'm not submitting large super large files. It could be a one page, you know, PDF document, but it's, it doesn't go in, doesn't, what's the word? The, the upload often upload fails.” P8_

- _“So what what we all did was fax it directly to the VA and say a prayer. You know, the quality control through New York State is very useful, but if you are waiting for days to for your package to go through, sometimes I just say, well, you know, screw it. I haven't heard from them. They haven't approved it. So I'm just going to send it straight to the VA. Especially, especially when someone is in a financial dire situation.” P11_

- _“But then, you know, once the veteran has conducted his exams, depending on the veteran too, like I'll usually take a look at the exams just to kind of see where things are at. Unfortunately there's been a lot of, lot of errors in, in the, in the process, the claims process lately. So we've been trying to, again, stay on top of things just so you know, if, if we see, you know, an exam request was requested incorrectly or you know, the wrong exam was requested altogether and we try to stay on top of that, that way we're not losing time for the veteran or the veterans, you know, or the VA's not getting charged for the wrong exam. It's, it has been an issue.” P4_

- _“We are CC'd, however, the interoffice mail that used to come to like literally like we'd get stacks a couple times a day of, of VA letters. Those, they don't do those anymore for the most part. There are certain ones that, that we do still get, but for like actual VA claims and decisions, we don't get those.” P4_

- _“That's with the claims accuracy request. Yeah. And so only VSOs can make this CAR claims accuracy request review. Maybe it's review, it's either claims accuracy request or review. I abbreviate it so often that I don't know what it is, but it allows the VSO to submit it. There's specific parameters as to when it can be submitted. And then oftentimes we get a decision really, really, really quickly. And, again, oftentimes I'm getting like super favorable decisions because we've identified something is wrong with it, you know, wrong with the initial decision. So I would love that sort of feature within, if that's a program that's going to continue the claim accuracy master review, if that's something that's gonna happen for the foreseeable future, I would love for that option within and knowing again that it's only for VSOs.” P8_

- _“One of the things I like to do is to have veterans and service members respond back to me after they have exams, so that way if there's an issue with those exams, I can be aware of it. Yeah. And, and report that if necessary. Or, you know, explain to them why they considered what happened a problem, or if it was just a misunderstanding or something like that.” P10_

- _“I have the ability to, however, due to the number of people I deal with on a regular basis, I don't always go in and take a look at something. Generally, I tell veterans, you know, I, I am a very busy person. I will do whatever I can to help you, but I need you to help me by reminding me to, every once in a while go do this.” P10_

**21-526ez Pain Point Quotes**

- _“Well, one, one thing is the exam, I guess the contracted examiners when I put a veteran in, I like I spoke to you earlier about the flashes when I, when I flashed someone who is, is a blind amputee and then they the person has cancer. That is a priority veteran. So I put it in as a priority and I put it in let's, I'm going to give you the date I put it in April 24th. And here it is October 18th and that veteran still has not had his exams and he's a priority veteran priority means priority. It's it should, it should, but it, but it hasn't. And that veteran is blind, a double amputee with two forms of cancer and he's yet to have his exams. And I've gone through numerous calls, emails and everything to try to get the veterans exams done housebound because he is basically housebound 'cause he has to use a wheelchair to move around in his apartment. And so far, we are still trying to get those exams done for this veteran. But he received letters from QTC, which is also one of the VAs contractors. They sent him letters to go to exams 2 1/2 hours away from where he lives, and there's no one who's going to transport this veteran to those locations. He lives in \[City, State]. They want him to go to either \[State] or \[State] for his C\&P exams and he has no transportation.” P3_

- _“Once the veteran has conducted his exams, depending on the veteran too, like I'll usually take a look at the exams just to kind of see where things are at. Unfortunately there's been a lot of, lot of errors in, in the, in the process, the claims process lately. So we've been trying to, again, stay on top of things just so you know, if, if we see, you know, an exam request was requested incorrectly or you know, the wrong exam was requested altogether and we try to stay on top of that, that way we're not losing time for the veteran or the veterans, you know, or the VA's not getting charged for the wrong exam. It's, it has been an issue.” P4_

- _“We always want top sheet stuff so the VA doesn't miss it. So we just wanna make sure that those records are there. But that's primarily what I'm looking for, is the records to support the claim, whether it be an increase or a new service connection … So in, in VBMS, it's, it's a virtual folder. So when you go over to documents, like if I click into it, so this particular person I'm looking at has 918 documents. So I do mine per hundred. So I have 10 pages of documents, which in within each document are multiple pieces of paper. It can be from one to, you know, 3000 doesn't matter. So when we top sheet, we always want to put the service treatment records are within this person's file. He got out a long time ago. So his service treatment records may be buried at the bottom of VBMS. Right on page 10. Unfortunately, I always, I, my quip is the best and worst part of the VA is that there's people involved, right? 'cause people make mistakes and sometimes you don't always get the best quality. And, and the same thing for VSOs too. I, I shouldn't have to expect the VSR, the veteran service representative, the person that gets the claim first to go and search out that service treatment record that's at page 10, right? If they're not a veteran, if they're not, if they're new, they may not know how to find it. So I want, it's my job to go into that service treatment record, pull out the relevant evidence and submit it with the claim. So I'm putting it at the top of the file. So when I scan those documents and put 'em in direct mail upload, or if I do it in SEP, it's right there at the top. So as soon as I click documents in VBMS and it's sorted by date, that's gonna be up top. So it's gonna be directly associated with the claim. There's really no excuse for the VA to ignore it.” P7_

**21-686c Quotes**

- _“We don't use it as often. I have not used it on VePro yet. When I did in the past on the PDF, it's a lot and I think it's crazy that VA wants every marriage, every divorce ev you know what I mean? Like especially when like if it's a veteran that had several marriages.” P1_

- _“The 686C we don't use as often because the majority of the time we try to make the veteran be. Use their technology as much as possible and we will let them know that they can add their spouse or their children on their My Healthy Vet account. They can go on and add, add their dependents and a lot of them have just phoned the VA and added their dependent. They've been able to do it that way. So we don't use that form as often, but what we do do is that when there's one in place, we use it to gather our information when we're doing what is called a DIC claim for a surviving spouse.” P3_

- _“I don't use it that often because most of the claims that I've submitted with the three months that I've been here have been just to, to start the, the compensation, the disability compensation. A lot of veterans have never claimed benefits before. So they're, they're just looking to get benefits. And if, and if they don't get rated 30% or higher, the dependents don't come into play. So it's, I can count on my hand how many times that I've included the 686C with that. That's because they have to get rated at 30% or higher first. And so some of them want to do the 686C at the time of the application and we have no problem doing that. And they'll bring the birth certificates for the children, the, the marriage marriage certificate or whatever. It's, it's never an issue. We can always, it's just another form to submit with the claim. It's never a problem to do that. But I've only had it requested for maybe about, like, say for instance, let's take for example, a hundred claims. I may have had it requested maybe three or four times.” P6_

- _“I just ask for the information and within 24 hours, if it's simple, you know, there's nothing crazy about it. It's approved notification letter is post dated or to be sent out and the award print is already done within I'd say 24 hours. It's phenomenal. Anytime I can, I'll use it.” P7_

- _“You know, we generally ask veteran to bring in their marriage certificate. We've been told by the VSRS locally that that's not required, but I generally like to have it on hand because it's nice to have on hand just, you know, in case questions arise, which they do sometimes. And in the situation where, you know, a veteran passes away, that's normally a requirement to be submitted by DIC. So, so we'll we like to get that. As far as Social Security numbers, no, I just need the number to put it into the system. Birth certificates, I'll send that if they bring them, but I know that's not required. And so we just put their birth, their dates of birth and Social Security numbers into the system. They have any previous marriages, we'll ask them for that information. We'll put that into the system as well.” P9_

- _“Not too often, not too often. And, and I'll tell you why, since I just started here, people just started coming in. So I haven't conducted a lot of outreach once I get my work, my, my VA work study person, which that was also a pain in the neck to get. I mean, I, that was really hard to, to pinpoint and figure out how to do. I had to use my personal account to get this city's application through, which I think it's ridiculous. I had to use my ID me to submit a work study application on behalf of this this city. And then you there, there's a thing where it says business or personal. I had to hit business. But truly and honestly, it's not business because this is my ID me. So it's going to be tied to my ID me. And if I leave the next person, they don't have an ID, They have to create one, right? So just so you know about that work study, trying to bring a work study person here in the in this office. So my goal over, you know, I don't want to keep blabbing, but eventually I'm going to conduct outreach to the reserve stations and the younger population. And I think that once I'm able to conduct that outreach, I might be using those forms a lot, you know, a bit more often, if that makes sense.” P11_

- _“It's a long form. That's about it. It's only long because there's so much space and that's not a bad thing. I have no complaints on either one. It asks everything that the paper asks for is what SEP asks for and that's really all that matters. It's super long and it's just because like it only allowed for like three kids at one point and now it allows, you know, you can have a, a whole football team of children.” P7_

**21-674 Quotes**

- _“No, we don't use it at all. It's not in the Vet Pro system we have. We have forms that are not in the Vet Pro system that should be. That's one of them. We have the automobile allowance form, it's not in Vet Pro. And the one for a special specially adaptive housing, it's not in Vet Pro. Those are the forms that are not in their that should be because our veterans are qualified for those benefits and just like the education one, your, your dependents are in your spouse or eligible for those benefits. But it's not in our system, not in the Vet Pro system. We only have so many forms and I think that those are the, the forms that are used more frequently that are listed in Vetpro.” P3_

- _“Yes, I do. Just did one yesterday. As a matter of fact, we do have two colleges here, a community college and a college that's connected to the Texas Tech system. It's a university, which is the one I graduated from. And I've done several, you know, dependent school things, whether it's a child that's turning 18, but still in high school or a child that is going into college or may have already been in college and didn't know about the benefits. Mm. Which is one of the things that sometimes really surprises me. Yeah. But I, I've done several of those.” P10_

**Process Pain Point Quotes**

- _“I mean, I think every, like, there's always gripes about it. I, I think, you know, for, for what it is, it's, it's a good process. I, I think it's very, it's definitely a well-intentioned process. And again, i, I kind of fall back to like, there's people involved, right? So you get folks that may be jaded, they may have been doing this for 20 years and they're jaded about these claims, or they think that this person doesn't deserve this or they're just, they're not, not working hard enough to find the information or they didn't receive good training because the people that train them didn't receive good training. So I think it all falls back to a training aspect.” P7_

- _“And if there was a way that we could track that, we could track these claims without having to call the benefits hotline, that would be like one of my dreams where we could just plug in the veterans information and boom, there's the claim. And this is where they are in the process. If I could do that first, the majority of the people I work with, that would be wonderful because then I can keep, I can keep track without the phone calls and the chat and plug it in. This is where they are and send them an update and we're done. And it, it makes me feel like I I did my job all the way through.” P11_

**Attractors Quotes**

- _“I would say the instant access to the 2122 would definitely be because the 686 is something that's going to come secondary. The POA has to be first. You can't do anything unless you have to 2122 instantly. You can't do anything. You can't get in the record. You can't do anything with a 686C do you can get in it?” P3_

- _“The thing is, is, you know, the fastest way for me to get representation is to bring someone in the office, sit them down, create a file and get their signature. And then we can D2D that intent or that, that POA. But that really depends on how quickly the VA is moving. Sometimes I don't get that POA for a couple of hours. You know, on average, I'd say it's 5 to 10 minutes to get that representation. But they're in front of me. We're talking, we're creating the file and then about 10 minutes later, I have access to VBMS. But when I'm talking to somebody on the phone, they have a dire situation and, and I have to bring, schedule them an appointment and bring them. And before I can answer their simple question, if I can tell them, go on your va.gov and give us representation and then I can quickly go on there and click accept and then I have access. I think that's very cool. And that's, that's a huge benefit to the veteran or the surviving spouse.” P9_

**Expectations Quotes**

- And just confirming, because you did mention it earlier, but I just wanna confirm that you mentioned you do prefer the, the Vet Pro or the va.gov experiences over filling out the PDFs? _“Oh yeah. A million times, yes. Yeah.” P1_

- Do you prefer going step by step or would you like to see all of that at once for any reason? _“No step-by-step. Because that's kind of how we take the paper claims too. You know, they're broken up into sections and I think the paper claims do a really good job of presenting guidance and instruction beforehand. You know, like the first four pages I think are instructions before we get the actual, not actually the first seven pages. So say it's like six to eight, I can never remember. But it's a lot of instructions. So I think, you know, if you present it all at once, it'd probably be overwhelming. Especially for people that don't use SEP in the capacity that DAV uses it.” P7_

- _“No, I, well at least let me say this, I don't want the same, it's a nightmare of what they go through when it's asking. There's a lot of, in my opinion, a lot of unnecessary blocks. But again, if you're doing it on your own and you don't have representation, then perhaps they are valuable fields that are being asked on it. But it's the, what is it? It asks for the, like, I don't wanna say a narrative, but it asks for a brief statement on each of the contentions where oftentimes I don't think that it's necessary, especially if someone was diagnosed on active duty. And I would love to just see a dropdown box that says diagnosed on active duty, rather than thinking that someone's spending a considerable amount of time writing a small narrative about how the condition is related to their active duty service time. But then there are cases when it wasn't diagnosed on active duty. Right? And so that additional information may be helpful to the DI in considering the claim. So I think the SEP portal for the 526ez right now is, it doesn't have that box. And I think from the, from the VSO standpoint, I don't need, I don't think we need all those boxes. And if there was something that we needed to expand on, I know the methods in which that we could add that information in order for it to be part of the claim in order for it to be part of consideration with the claim.” P8_

- _“Oh, I want to see the entire form. And I mean, that's just kind of the way that I've come up. Like if you go into Vetraspec and you pull up the form and edit it in real in real time. Yeah, I don't like to see it. That's very confusing. I think to go box by box when you go on to va.gov and then it fills out the form for you. So I like to see the entire form.”_ And what about the box by box on va.gov is confusing? Can you just expand on that a bit? _“I just don't like it. I just don't like and yeah, I just don't like. I like to see the entire form. So I think that's just personal preference. I wouldn't say there's that one's better than the other. And then then I'm just trusting the document.”_ P9

**Wishlist Quotes**

- _”I mean, you know, if you guys had ITF functionality, the intent to file as well. You know, I mean I, I love Tyler and I will still always use it because it is my national organization's tool, but like, you know, with SEP, my director, he pretty much uses it for filing all his, you know, when he does file claims, that's what he uses it for. I would definitely see myself using it a lot more if, if it was a one stop shop for, you know, the 686C, the 2122, the 21-0966, 21-674. Yeah, I mean I would, if there's a direct system to use, I would absolutely do it because if we can do anything to do to like expedite dependency, it's, it's always in the benefit of the veteran when we're talking, you know, nine to 11 months of wait time. If they file paper, you know, 674s paper, 686c's, you know, there's no reason for it to be taken that long. I, I understand they're not prioritized, but the, at the same time it, it takes minutes for me to do a 686c.”_ P4

- _“Now SEP back in the day we used to be able to reopen previously denied conditions and that's still an option. Like I said, the program hasn't been updated in forever. I think I worked with the last two guys that VA had like that would do errors for SEP when I was in DC for a little bit … Oh yeah, previously denied. Thank you so much. Thank you. So in there it says reopen and that was a great feature. I mean I did it on my own personal claim. If you do it now, it just generates a out of date application. So the VA's gonna send you what we call an AMA letter, an Appeals Modernization Act letter. And it's gonna say you need to file it on the appropriate form. However, as a veteran myself, if I go into my va.gov profile, I can file an appeal, I can file a supplemental claim and I can do a high level review all from my profile. So that's frustrating. It'd be nice to have that function back.” P7_

**Technology Pain Point Quotes**

- _“Well, actually, they vet pro had not removed the old ones and until they did, until they updated the ones, we we usually let them know that there's an error on the form and that will prompt them to go in and correct it and put in the proper form. And when the VA kicks a claim back, because the forms outdated, how long can that delay a veteran's claim? Roughly? It can be anywhere from a month to maybe four months.” P3_

- _“So what we do is we submit, submit the e-mail to the veteran with the form already populated and it allows them on the other end to sign the document electronically. And most of the time I am spending the time teaching the veteran how to sign electronic documents because if they have never gone to a blind rehab center, they don't know how to do those things. So they get a lesson from me on how to sign an electronic document.  And it's, it's amazing because they can use voice over, but when they use Voiceover, when they get to the end to where you sign it, they're not able to sign it with Voiceover on. They have to turn it off in order for them to sign the document. Yes, that is the only difference that they have is doing that, which it worked. But there's another way that we can do it to bypass that is that we use finger dot ink and finger dot ink. What it does is that the veteran goes to that website and it brings up what looks like a little calculator with a box at the top of it where you plug in numbers and we put those, they put the number in. I am going to give them the number because I have a QR code that comes to me to give them the number and then that allows them to sign as well.” P3_

- _“More than likely, I would say more than likely than not, I would definitely use those tools. I can tell you when, when we're submitting some POAs it has taken us like 12 days for it to go through for POA. I've never seen it do that before, but sometimes it has done that. And also, I found that if we submit any of these documents in the mornings, they go right through. And I've even seen an ITF that's been in since October 3rd. It didn't go through until yesterday. But I find that if you sit submit them in the morning, for whatever reason, I don't know, they come through the next day fine. But if you submit them after a certain time, they're sitting there and then you have to wait until whenever they get through there. I don't know what that's about, but that happens.” P3_

- _“Yeah. So that, and on multiple occasions, my clients, my veterans have received kickback letters from the VA that the submissions were done on outdated forms. So that's super frustrating as well. And then trying to clear that up. And that was not the, the, that, that wasn't on every single submission, but it was on a lot of submissions. So that made it really frustrating my clients, you know, I felt as though it was, it was a reflection of me. If the outdated 686C form goes in and the VA does not accept it, and then the veteran gets a kickback letter and then my client is like, well, I'm coming to you, why, why am I getting this letter that it was done on an inaccurate form. So that was probably one of the larger reasons too. I've even had kickbacks with the 526 claims form. And so that's frustrating.” P8_

- _“Yes. Well I should say yes as it applies to SEP. So SEP like four years ago, I don't know when it was exactly, it was kicking out the 2018 686c I think. And then all of a sudden it just started kicking out the 2014 version. I don't know why. And so we had some growing pains with that, but as soon as the VA understood like, hey, this is, this is the form we're gonna get, they, it usually is no problem. I say usually because SEP to the 686C religious or marriage, marriage type isn't populated on the form. So we've gotten kickbacks where it's like, hey, how were they married? Well, religious ceremony, well it doesn't say it on the form, it's just because that that information doesn't transfer from SEP to the form. And so that's been kind of a, a recent pain. They weren't really picking us picking at us over that, but in the last month or so, we've got a couple dependency forms kicked back. But it's, it's usually been solved by, by filing a leaf, which is our internal VA with, with St. Paul at least our internal like complaint or you know, messaging, formal message invoice it, I don't know what you wanna call it. But once we send a leaf, usually those get turned out over with, you know, with no issue.” P4_

- _“I don't know. So for example, on the 21-526ez under the page it'll be page 10 under the toxic exposure portion of the form. I think that's section three or four. Now there's a box under like, so like you have all these check boxes for like, you know, asbestos exposure, MOS related exposure, but then they have a other, which is what we've been using for a lot of stuff and you know, you can check it and then you can start typing things in there. But you know, you may only get one or two lines of, of text in there before it just, it won't let you add anymore. But you can st I mean visually you physically can still see there's more space available on the form.” P4_

- _“An updated version. Okay. So, you know, say My Tyler isn't up to date yet with the updated version, and so I'm going to the web to do that fillable form so that ultimately my client doesn't get a rejection letter. And you know, everything I've read and everything I know says that the VA has an obligation to accept outdated forms within a certain period of time, and usually we're within that period of time, but I'm getting somebody on the other side that's receiving it that's not aware of it. So then it's like, okay, I can educate that person on the other side of what the rules and are, or we can just use the most up to date form if, if I know that it exists. Right. Use the most up to date form so that it's just smooth sailing when we, when we submit it.”  P8_
