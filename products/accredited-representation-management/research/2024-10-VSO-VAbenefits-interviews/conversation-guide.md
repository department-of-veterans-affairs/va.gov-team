## **Intro - 5 minutes**

Thanks for joining us today! My name is \[name] and I’m a user experience researcher working for VA.gov. \[NAME] will be joining us to take notes.

- **This session should take about an hour.** We’ll be focusing on your experiences supporting Veterans with VA disability compensation claims to inform a VA.gov tool that will be replacing the Stakeholder Enterprise Portal or SEP.

* **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions to help improve digital tools for VSOs.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback. I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

- **Your participation is completely voluntary.** If for any reason you want to stop, or do not want to answer a question, please let me know.

- **I want to be transparent that myself and my co-workers are here in a research capacity only.** Your honest opinions will not impact your accreditation in any way, and we want to hear about your experiences, good or bad, in case there are processes we can improve in the future.

- **Knowing this, I have \[#] VA employees who would like to observe our session, but are optional.** Would that be okay, or do you prefer to keep the session to just the three of us?

  - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.

  - If yes: Admit observers.

    - Then, ask the observer(s) to give a brief, camera-on introduction, first name and position with VA.gov.

    - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observer(s) to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth.

- **Are you ok if I record my screen and audio for analysis and reporting purposes?** We like to record to confirm that we’ve captured your opinions accurately and sometimes share video or audio clips with our colleagues at VA. Nothing is ever shared outside of VA. If we do share video or audio we don’t share anything that identifies you, such as your name or face.

  - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

_Start recording._

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Do I have permission to record my screen and the audio as we talk today for analysis and reporting purposes?

    1. _Unlikely - very unlikely_, is there anything we could change or add to help with adoption of the proposed tool?

### **Things to watch for:**

- What is the VSORs process for preparing and filing VA disability compensation claims ([VA Form 21-526EZ](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-526ez/))?

- How do VSORs support Veterans with managing dependents with VA Forms [21-686c: Application Request to Add and/or Remove Dependents](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-686c/) and [21-674: Request for Approval of School Attendance](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-674/)?

- What technology do they use in their processes?

  - What do they like and dislike about their digital tools?

  - How do AT VSORs use technology to support them?

    - What do they need to be successful with new VA.gov tools?

- What additional forms do VSORs frequently use?

  - Which would they find most beneficial to have digitized?

- If the ARP MVP only included instant acceptance/denial of VA Form 21-22, and submission of 21-686c and 21-674, would that be enough for ARP adoption?


## **Post-task questions - 5 minutes**

15. We’d love to hear what you think about your overall experience of being scheduled and participating in the research session. Could we have done anything differently/better?

    1. _BVA only:_ For Veteran studies, do you have any feedback on anything we could do differently or improve in the recruitment and research process?

16. Observers, do you have any additional questions?


## **Thank-you and closing - 2 minutes**

Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for representatives.

Lastly, I will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other representatives you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
