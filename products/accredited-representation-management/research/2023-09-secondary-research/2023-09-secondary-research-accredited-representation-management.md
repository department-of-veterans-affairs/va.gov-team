# 09/2023 Secondary Research Findings
Office of the CTO - Digital Experience (OCTO-DE), Benefits, Accredited Representation Management Team

Date: Revised 10/17/2023

Janelle Finnerty (janelle.finnerty@oddball.io)

# Background
The Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) is seeking contractor support to help the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to migrate Veteran and Power of Attorney (PoA) experiences from the legacy Stakeholder Enterprise Platform (SEP) product and eBenefits platform to VA.gov.

The primary goal is to make it easier, safer, and faster for Veterans and people whom they assign Power of Attorney (PoA), to create and update their PoA relationships and explore new ways that VA.gov can better support Veterans who choose to interact with VA through a representative.

## OCTO Priorities
- Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience
- Fast-track disability claims, starting with PACT Act claims

## [Veteran Journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)
- Getting out
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring

# Research Goals
1. Understand Veterans' process with searching, selecting, and maintaining their relationship with their representative. Including Veteran goals, needs, and pain points.
2. Understand the representatives process with approving PoA and maintaining their relationship with a Veteran. Including representative goals, needs, and pain points.
3. Understand VA processes for power of attorney/representatives and how those processes can impact the Accredited Representation Management experience.

## Outcome
Clearly defined user and process needs to inform the digital Accredited Representation Management experience.

## Research Questions
### Veteran Process & Pain Points
1. At what point in the claims process are Veterans researching representatives? Is it at the initial claim, for decision reviews, or both?
    - What information are Veterans looking for in this process?
    - Do Veterans want to ‘shop’ representatives prior to selecting one?
2. Do Veterans have challenges understanding why they’d want a representative?
    - Do Veterans understand the differences between the representative options (VSO, attorney, claims agent)? As well as which one is best for their scenario?
3. Do any of the following have impact on the Veterans representative selection decision:
    - Cost
    - Community or peer feedback
    - Location (local or remote)
4. After a representative is selected do Veterans want a digital option  to manage their representation? Including seeing, changing, or removing representation.

### Representative (Rep) Process & Pain Points
#### About Representatives
1. What benefits can representatives support?
2. Are all representatives brought on as Power of Attorney (PoA)?
   - What systems are used to manage PoA?
3. What systems can a Representative use?
4. What is the difference between each representative (attorney, claims agent, VSO)?
   - What are the pros and cons of each representative?
   - Do representatives work alone or on teams?
   - Which representatives can and cannot charge fees?
5. Can representatives support Veterans remotely?
6. What accreditation is required for representatives? Is it nationwide or state specific?
   - Do representatives ever lose accreditation? How is loss of accreditation managed?
7. What happens once a claim has been finalized and a representative is no longer needed?
#### Veteran Representative Engagement
8. What is the typical audience the VSO supports in filing claims?
9. Can Veterans contact/request more than one representative at a time?
10. Can Veterans decline a representative after contacting them?
#### 21-22 Specific
11. What are the differences between the 21-22 and 21-22a?
12. What situations link to the 21-22? Or should link to the 21-22?

# Key Findings
## Veteran Process Key Findings
1. Veterans seek assistance from representatives to **successfully** navigate the complex claims process in a **timely** manner, from initial submission to appeals.
2. Veterans **lose trust** in representatives whose actions lead to **claim delays** or **unsatisfactory results**, leading them to explore **alternative** representation or self-help options.
3. Many Veterans come to VA.gov to complete **specific, well-defined** tasks, with filing and tracking **claims** being the most popular task.
4. Veterans' choices between in-person and digital support **varied**, but their choices were primarily influenced by the level of **convenience** and the **quality** of support offered.
5. Among both Veterans and representatives, attorneys were the most **easily understood** in terms of their purpose, often being the go-to choice for handling claims at the **Board** level.

## Veteran Process Details of Findings
1. Veterans seek assistance from representatives to **successfully** navigate the complex claims process in a **timely** manner, from initial submission to appeals.

   - Veterans rely on representatives to help them understand the claims process and submit a **well-prepared, evidence based** claim that is **easily understood** by the VA. Well-prepared claims can **decrease** filing time and **increase** satisfaction of the claim decision.

3. Veterans **lose trust** in representatives whose actions lead to **claim delays** or **unsatisfactory results**, leading them to explore **alternative** representation or self-help options.

   - Veterans appear to hold **diverse opinions**, especially regarding Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs), as their quality can fluctuate significantly. Among veterans, the most frequently reported **Power of Attorney (PoA) change** involved transitioning from a VSO to an attorney following an unsatisfactory disability rating or extended wait times.

    - The primary cause of claim and appeal delays are **duplicate submissions**. Such duplicates often arise from representatives' misunderstanding of claim requirements or their tendency to submit multiple copies of the same claim as a precaution, due to poor claim status and tracking.

4. Many Veterans come to VA.gov to complete **specific, well-defined** tasks, with filing and tracking **claims** being the most popular task.

    - Veterans interviewed indicated they visit VA.gov **weekly** to complete specific tasks and **don’t browse** very often.

5. Veterans' choices between in-person and digital support **varied**, but their choices were primarily influenced by the level of **convenience** and the **quality** of support offered.

    - Many Veterans opt to conduct online research or complete tasks **independently** before resorting to visiting a physical VA location, including expressing interest in chat-bots. When they are unable to complete the task independently, Veterans typically **prefer in-person** visits over making phone calls. This preference arises from their **frustration** with the phone tree system, which often proves ineffective in assisting them with task completion.

    - Conversely, there are numerous Veterans who **favor** in-person support, particularly widows, combat Veterans, senior Veterans, those who have never filed a claim before, and those with limited technology access. VSOs mentioned that these are the primary groups they assist. One of the **most common** reasons for visiting was to file claims and check their statuses.

6. Among both Veterans and representatives, attorneys were the most **easily understood** in terms of their purpose, often being the go-to choice for handling claims at the **Board** level.

    - They were also perceived as having the strongest motivation to "win a case" since they receive 20% of the Veteran's award as part of their fees, and they are also the most likely to establish and maintain relationships with Board staff.

## Rep Process Key Findings
1. The most commonly mentioned representative challenge was navigating their **extensive caseloads**.
2. Representatives face **persistent** difficulties in navigating documentation within the VA ecosystem, **regardless** of the particular process or paperwork involved. These challenges can lead to **negative impacts** on the quality and timeline of document processing.
3. Power of Attorney (PoA) introduces its own set of challenges, often stemming from **inconsistent information management** and a **lack of notifications**.

## Rep Process Details of Findings
1. The most commonly mentioned representative challenge was navigating their **extensive caseloads**.

    - VSOs have identified **personnel shortages** as a challenge in proactively assisting Veterans with their claims. Additionally, variations in **access to resources** , including accredited representatives, emphasizes the need to ensure VA accessibility across all regions. For instance, a county VSO in an urban setting mentioned having just 10 representatives to serve 50,000 Veterans.

    - Since Veteran Law is federal law, and there are **limited** specialized firms nationwide, attorneys and claims agents often handle **hundreds, if not thousands**, of clients. They tend to work in teams, but the VA's restriction to a single Power of Attorney (PoA) prevents support teams from accessing Veteran information needed to assist the attorney or claims agent. This is a **major pain point** that distracts from the work of representing Veterans.

2. Representatives face **persistent** difficulties in navigating documentation within the VA ecosystem, **regardless** of the particular process or paperwork involved. These challenges can lead to **negative impacts** on the quality and timeline of document processing.

    - Across initial claims, decision reviews, supplemental claims, and power of attorney there were common themes of document errors including:

        - **Most common were signature errors** ; missing signatures from Veterans and representatives, signatures appearing questionable, or signatures from representatives who are not authorized
        - Lack of complete documentation or over documentation
        - Typos, misspellings, and extra spaces that **systems cannot read** or understand
        - Information **not matching** official records
        - Incorrect form submission

    - Importantly, documents with **only representative signatures** can delay rating decisions as they fail to fulfill the Duty to Assist requirement. In such cases, VA sends a notice to the Veteran, imposing a 30-day hold on the claim, during which it can be developed but not rated until either the 30 days pass or the Veteran returns the 5103 Response Waiver.

3. Power of Attorney (PoA) introduces its own set of challenges, often stemming from **inconsistent information management** and a **lack of notifications**.

    - In the intake process for 21-22 forms, there are **common issues** such as mislabeling or incorrect labeling as correspondence. Furthermore, there appears to be **no streamlined method** for tracking or modifying Power of Attorney (PoA) information, including editing representative addresses and contact details. This necessitates **manual** notification to multiple entities (VBA, BVA, OGC) for address updates to reflect across various systems, leading to instances where PoA attorneys and claims agents **miss critical correspondence**, including decisions.

    - Representatives frequently experience **unexpected loss of PoA** without notification, typically due to the Veteran or another representative filing for new representation without realizing it'll revoke current representation access. This **abrupt loss** of access not only restricts representatives from logging into VBMS but also ceases their receipt of important Veterans' claim-related communications. Additionally, it can lead to situations where representatives without PoA access **continue to receive notifications for claims** they shouldn't be involved with. In the worst-case scenario, these sudden changes can even result in attorneys and claims agents **not receiving payment** for their services.

    - Extent of Authority
        - A representative is authorized to prepare, present, and prosecute a claimant's claim and has the authority to
            - review the claimant's records
            - present evidence on behalf of the claimant
            - sign an informal claim, a notice of disagreement (NOD), or a substantive appeal on behalf of the claimant, and
            - withdraw an appeal.

    - Representatives cannot sign for an original claim. If it's an increase or a subsequent claim, the representative can sign for the Veteran.
        - Note: There are two systems that digitize Veterans signatures today: VetPro and VetraSpec.

5. **What is the difference between each representative (VSO, attorney, claims agent)?**
    - VSO
        - VA-recognized and accredited
        - Free to Veterans and their families
        - Helps gather any evidence to submit a Fully Developed Claim
        - Can correspond with the VA about the Veterans claim on their behalf
        - Many VSOs also sponsor a range of Veteran-centric programs such as providing transportation to and from VA medical center appointments, funds and volunteers for disaster relief, and grants.
        - VSOs also lobby Congress on behalf of issues facing Veterans and help support requests for resources needed by VA to better serve Veterans, their families, and survivors.
            - [VA.gov Accredited Representatives](https://www.benefits.va.gov/vso/)
        - Not all recognized VSOs provide accredited representatives and must advise Veterans on how to find accredited representation to support in PoA.
            - [2022/11 VSOs Frequently Asked Questions](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46412)
    - Attorney & Claims Agent
        - Typically perform their representation **after** the VA has issued an initial decision on a claimant's claim.
            - This is when attorneys and claims agents are permitted to charge fees.
            - At that stage of the adjudication process attorneys or claim agents may be helpful in further developing evidence in support of the Veterans claim and crafting persuasive and legal arguments on their behalf to submit to the VA.
            - Both can assist in navigating the VA appeals process.
                - [VA.gov Accredited Representatives](https://www.benefits.va.gov/vso/)
    - Attorney vs Claims Agent
        - Claims agents are basically VSOs, but they function independently and are not usually associated with an authorized organization.
        - Attorneys can provide similar service as claims agents and VSOs, but usually specialize in appeals and other higher-level dealings before the VA, the Board of Veterans Appeals (BVA), or other US Courts. Like claims agents, they also charge a fee, and so do not usually work on initial claims.

6. **What are the pros and cons of each representative?**
    - Note: These are collected from Reddit to see what opinions Veterans have of these groups. Would love any VA input on these.
    - Pros: All
        - Years of experience
        - Access to up to date claim information/have VBMS access
        - Can help build a successful claim leading to higher disability ratings
        - Up to date knowledge on available claim options
    - Pros: VSO
        - Don't charge fees
    - Pros: Attorney
        - Good for appeals

    - Cons: VSO
        - Lack of responses or long wait times
        - Some VSOs are volunteer based and lack training
        - No consequence if actions impact the Veterans case
    - Cons: Attorney
        - Cost more
    - Cons: Claims Agent
        - Can be seen as 'back alley' operations
        - Otherwise there isn't a lot of information out there on claims agents

7. **Do representatives work alone or on teams?**
    - Representation of a claim can take years, for this reason usually teams, not just individuals, work through the claim lifecycle.
    - Attorneys and Claims Assistants rely on support staff to perform administrative tasks like tracking deadlines, securing evidence, uploading documentation, ensuring the claim makes it to the VA, troubleshooting, etc.
        - [2021/04 Power of Attorney VSO Research Report](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/lighthouse-ux/tree/master/Benefits%20and%20Appeals%20Research/2021-04-Power-of-Attorney-Experience-with-VSOs)

8. **Which representatives can and cannot charge fees?**
    - **VSO** : It is important to know that VA-recognized VSOs, and their representatives, always provide their services on benefit claims free-of-charge.
    - **Attorneys & Claims Agents** : Unlike VSOs, VA-accredited attorneys and agents may charge you a fee for their representation in appealing or requesting additional review of an adverse VA decision. Only VA-accredited attorneys and claims agents may charge you fees for assisting in a claim for VA benefits, and only after VA has issued an initial decision on the claim and they have complied with the power-of-attorney and the fee agreement requirements.
        - [VA.gov Accredited Representatives](https://www.benefits.va.gov/vso/)
        - There are 3 types of appeals: Supplemental Review, Higher Level Review, and Decision Review Request

9. **Can representatives support Veterans remotely?**
    - **VSOs** : It does appear that VSOs can help Veterans remotely as it is mentioned on VSO websites and in press releases by the VA.

        - [2022/06 Individuals Using the Department of Veterans Affairs' Information Technology Systems To Access Records Relevant to a Benefit Claim](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/06/24/2022-13312/individuals-using-the-department-of-veterans-affairs-information-technology-systems-to-access#:~:text=VA's%20objective%20with%20this%20rulemaking,representation%20consistent%20with%20VA's%20policies.)
    - **Attorneys and claims agents** : Veteran Law is federal law, therefore attorneys can support Veterans anywhere in the country.
        - [2021/04 Power of Attorney VSO Research Report](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/lighthouse-ux/tree/master/Benefits%20and%20Appeals%20Research/2021-04-Power-of-Attorney-Experience-with-VSOs)
    - Veterans looking for remote access can vary. Some examples include; being homebound due to medical, looking for better support, or being overseas.

        - [Reddit: Overseas Example](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransBenefits/comments/gsq12q/overseas_vso/)

10. **What accreditation is required for representatives? Is it nationwide or state specific?**
    - Governed by the Office of General Council (OGC), this process recognizes Veteran Service organizations, attorneys and claims agents as valid representatives. This is the first step to gain access to VA systems.
    - **VSOs** work closely with the Office of General Council (OGC) to accredit their representatives. VSOs will provide internal training and exams approved by OGC, and then will email the list of trained representatives to OGC. Re-certification happens every 5 years, but VSOs undergo continuous training. There's no standard process for VSOs to verify with OGC which representatives need recertification, and all the variations are manual.
    - **Claims agents** will take an exam at the regional branch of the OGC. They have to recertify by taking Continuous Legal Education (CLE) every two years. Attendance to NOVA conference counts as CLE. Claims agents can sometimes go 2 - 4 years attempting to get accredited without success.
    - **Attorneys** have to provide their bar license to be accredited. Have to recertify by taking CLE every two years. Attendance to NOVA conference counts as CLE.
        - [2021/04 Power of Attorney VSO Research Report](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/lighthouse-ux/tree/master/Benefits%20and%20Appeals%20Research/2021-04-Power-of-Attorney-Experience-with-VSOs)

11. **Do representatives ever lose accreditation? How is loss of accreditation managed?**
    - There are very few consequences for not keeping up with accreditation renewal since the OGC has no targeted way to regularly track or remind representatives to complete their training.
        - [Power of Attorney/ A discovery sprint](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1686839758569/c518e69a2bf19d2ef1b868b98322f25d72ae9aab?sender=u1d7fe27ad03a782e135e8404)

12. **What happens once a claim has been finalized and a representative is no longer needed?**
    - **VSOs** do not terminate representation unless faced with ethical issues or if they are fired by the client.
    - **Attorneys and claims agents** regularly terminate representation when they have secured the benefits they were hired for, and they have set processes for this.

### Veteran Representative Engagement

1. **What is the typical audience the VSO supports in filing claims?**
    - VSOs primarily provide support to widows, combat Veterans, senior Veterans, and those who have never filed a claim before but are now dealing with service-related debilitating issues. VSOs also commonly assist Veterans with limited access to technology and email. Non-Veteran claimants, primarily surviving spouses, constitute a minority of VSOs' caseload, comprising no more than 15%.

2. **Can Veterans contact/have more than one representative at a time?**
    - From[@Lesley Ropp](https://dsva.slack.com/team/U04R9D4EWA2) / Veterans can only have one, but frequently forget they have a PoA on file and then try to assign another.

3. **Can Veterans decline a representative after contacting them?**
    - Veterans may discharge their attorney, claims agent, or VSO representative at any time and for any reason by informing VA of their request in writing. Veterans may also replace their representative with a new representative by filing a new[VA Form 21-22, Appointment of Veterans Service Organization as Claimant's Representative](http://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-22-ARE.pdf) or[VA Form 21-22a, Appointment of Individual as Claimant's Representative](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-22A-ARE.pdf) with VA.
        - [VA.gov Accredited Representatives](https://www.benefits.va.gov/vso/)

### 21-22 Specific

1. **What are the differences between the 21-22 and 21-22a?**
    - **21-22** : Grants PoA to an organization. Any representative working for the organization has the ability to represent the Veteran. Accredited VSOs like American Legion or VFW, or State and County VSOs have this type of POA. Usually representatives are[cross-accredited with multiple organizations](https://community.max.gov/x/yCGggQ) so they can better service Veterans. This means that they have access to the VBMS records of all the Veterans represented by the organizations that they are affiliated with.
    - **21-22a** : Grants POA to an accredited individual. Only the representative signing the form has the ability to represent the Veteran and access their VBMS records. This type of POA is available to attorneys and claims agents, who primarily represent Veterans in the appeal process, but who will occasionally take initial claims to build the relationship with a client. Attorneys and Claims Agents operate federally, meaning they can take clients from anywhere in the country because Veteran Law is federal.
    - **For unaccredited individuals** : They can represent Veterans on one-time matters with VA. They do not have electronic access to the Veteran's record, but can ask Veterans to request physical copies of their C-file.
        - [2021/04 Power of Attorney VSO Research Report](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/lighthouse-ux/tree/master/Benefits%20and%20Appeals%20Research/2021-04-Power-of-Attorney-Experience-with-VSOs)

    - [Instances of Find a Representative are documented here.](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1686839758569/c518e69a2bf19d2ef1b868b98322f25d72ae9aab?sender=u1d7fe27ad03a782e135e8404)
    - Plan on answering where the 21-22 should link during further user flow evaluation.
    - **Note** / on the 21-22 form and website, the only mention of Power of Attorney is hidden on Page 2 under the signature that a Notary is not needed. There is no mention of PoA on the website for the 21-22 form.

2. **Pay close attention to accessibility best practices**. The Facility Locator experience previously tested did not perform well due to lacking proper grouping, headers, and other screen reader best practices.

# Further Research Needed

There were several questions that I was unable to answer based on secondary research. It is recommended to cover these topics with Veterans during the first round of user testing:

1. What information are Veterans looking for in the representation selection process?
2. Do Veterans have challenges understanding why they'd want a representative?
3. Do Veterans understand the differences between the representative options (VSO, attorney, claims agent)?
  1. As well as which one is best for their scenario?
  2. What would Veterans call VSO representatives?
4. Does cost have any impact on Veterans representation decisions?
5. What are the use cases for Veterans coming to VA.gov to search for representation?
6. Where on VA.gov would Veterans expect to find and manage their representative information?
7. Mixed feedback on pagination on search results, recommend further testing.
