# Research Plan for Accredited Representative Management, Find a Representative LIVE User Test, 03/2024

## Background<a id="background"></a>

Create a high-quality accessible service or suite of services within VA.gov to serve Veterans in managing their Power of Attorney (PoA) representation and to support the deprecation of the legacy system used to take those actions.

### OCTO Priorities<a id="octo-priorities"></a>

**(Q1 2024) Grow digital submissions.** Focus on the needs of accredited representatives, and the Veterans who work with them: After years of focusing exclusively on Veterans who want to interact directly with VA, we will build tools for Veterans who want to work with accredited representatives, and the reps who support those Veterans. In doing so, we will redirect to VA.gov traffic currently going through eBenefits and Stakeholder Enterprise Portal (SEP).

[Current OCTO priorities.](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C055573C508/p1702505912797899?thread_ts=1702499959.887149\&cid=C055573C508)


### Veteran Journey<a id="veteran-journey"></a>

Veterans, their family members, and caregivers can get the help of a representative at any point in the journey where they are submitting claims. Such as; starting up, taking care of myself, retiring, and aging.

Full [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) for reference.


## Research Goals<a id="research-goals"></a>

1. Understand how Veterans navigate to the Find a Representative tool on VA.gov.

2. Understand usability of Find a Representative search feature on VA.gov.

3. Gather feedback from both mobile and assistive technology users on VA.gov.


### Outcome<a id="outcome"></a>

1. Navigation evaluation and recommendations to improve findability as needed.

2. Usability recommendations for improvements on the Find a Representative tool.

3. Documentation on any bugs or errors that arrive from live testing on mobile and assistive technology devices.


### Research questions<a id="research-questions"></a>

**Navigation**

1. Are Veterans easily able to locate the Find a Representative tool on VA.gov?

2. Does the navigation meet user expectations?

**Usability**

1. Do Veterans understand the information shown? Is there any information missing?

   1. Missing information can include page or representative level information.

2. Are there any challenges with the experience?

3. Are the next steps clear and actionable?

   1. Appoint a Representative; from the Form start page do users understand next steps of the 21-22/21-22a?

4. Does the experience meet user expectations?

   1. Do users want to search or filter by Veteran Service Organizations?

   2. Are there any other filter or sort options users are looking for?

   3. Does the name search function the way users expect?

5. Would Veterans engage with the tool? Why or why not?

**Mobile and Assistive Technology**

1. Are there any critical errors with the experience?

2. Are there any minor adjustments we could make to enhance the AT experience?


### Hypothesis<a id="hypothesis"></a>

**Navigation**

1. Veterans will navigate focusing on terms they know (such as VSO or attorney) or by associating representatives with claims.

**Usability**

1. By providing information in plain language, Veterans’ will understand representatives, and how they can help them.

2. Veterans will want to search for individual officers in their local area, not organizations.

3. Veterans will be looking for more information about the representative to make a decision. Such as reviews, office hours, or photographs.

4. Veterans will find the tool useful, but may look to outside sources to cross reference to increase comfort in their decision.

**Mobile and Assistive Technology**

1. Using the patterns created by VA.gov technical challenges with mobile and AT users will be limited and fixable.


## Methodology<a id="methodology"></a>

- **Warm-up questions** / The moderator will ask the Veteran a short series of questions to understand their current status with finding a representative and VA.gov engagement.

- **Usability testing** / Users will be asked to engage with VA.gov to test navigation, usability, and desirability of features of the Find a Representative tool.
