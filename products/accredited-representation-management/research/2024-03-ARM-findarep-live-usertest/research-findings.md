## Research Goals<a id="research-goals"></a>

### Veteran Journey<a id="veteran-journey"></a>

Veterans, their family members, and caregivers can get the help of a representative at any point in the journey where they are submitting claims. Such as; starting up, taking care of myself, retiring, and aging.

Full [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) for reference.


### Goals<a id="goals"></a>

1. Understand how Veterans navigate to the Find a Representative tool on VA.gov.

2. Understand usability of Find a Representative search feature on VA.gov.

3. Gather feedback from both mobile and assistive technology users on VA.gov.


### Outcome<a id="outcome"></a>

1. Navigation evaluation and recommendations to improve findability as needed.

2. Usability recommendations for improvements on the Find a Representative tool.

3. Documentation on any bugs or errors that arrive from live testing on mobile and assistive technology devices.


## Research Questions<a id="research-questions"></a>

**Navigation**

1. Are Veterans easily able to locate the Find a Representative tool on VA.gov?

2. Does the navigation meet user expectations?

**Usability**

1. Do Veterans understand the information shown? Is there any information missing?

   1. Missing information can include page or representative level information.

2. Are there any challenges with the experience?

3. Are the next steps clear and actionable?

   1. Appoint a Representative; from the Form start page do users understand next steps of the 21-22/21-22a?

4. Does the experience meet user expectations?

   1. Do users want to search or filter by Veteran Service Organizations?

   2. Are there any other filter or sort options users are looking for?

   3. Does the name search function the way users expect?

5. Would Veterans engage with the tool? Why or why not?

**Mobile and Assistive Technology**

1. Are there any critical errors with the experience?

2. Are there any minor adjustments we could make to enhance the AT experience?


## Methodology<a id="methodology"></a>

- **Warm-up questions** / The moderator will ask the Veteran a short series of questions to understand their current status with finding a representative and VA.gov engagement.

- **Usability testing** / Users will be asked to engage with VA.gov to test navigation to the tool, usability, and desirability of features of the Find a Representative tool.


## Tasks and Conclusions<a id="tasks-and-conclusions"></a>

1. Navigate to the Find a Representative landing page or tool.

   1. üö´ **Conclusion**: Unless a participant specifically searched ‚Äòvso‚Äô or ‚Äòveteran service officer‚Äô they struggled to find the landing page or tool.

2. Search for a representative in your area.

   1. ‚úÖ **Conclusion**: All users understood the task and next steps.

3. _Mobile only participants_: Review Appoint a Representative form start page and explain your next steps.

   1. üí° **Conclusion**: Participants would reach out to the representative for next steps or questions. They expected the representative available to instruct them on what to do.


## Details of Findings<a id="details-of-findings"></a>

### Task 1: Navigate to the Find a Representative landing page or tool.<a id="task-1-navigate-to-the-find-a-representative-landing-page-or-tool"></a>

üö´ **Conclusion**: Unless a participant specifically searched ‚Äòvso‚Äô or ‚Äòveteran service officer‚Äô they struggled to find the landing page or tool.

**Average time on task was 1:48.**

- Searching for ‚Äòvso‚Äô or ‚Äòveteran service officer‚Äô averaged **only 23 seconds.**

| ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Participant **starting** points were:                      | No matter where participants started they **found the tool in two places:**                                                                         |
| (4)Search, (2)MyVA, (2)Homepage, (2)Footer, (1)Top Navigation | (5)Search, (3)‚ÄòGet help from an accredited representative‚Äô link on the [How to file a claim page](https://www.va.gov/disability/how-to-file-claim/) |

Participants looked for **words they know, and skipped words they don‚Äôt know.** Commonly skipped links included:

- ‚ÄòGet help from an accredited representative‚Äô on the [Disability](https://www.va.gov/disability/) page

- ‚ÄòAccredited claims representatives‚Äô in the footer

- ‚ÄòOGC - Accreditation Search‚Äô in search

> _‚ÄúI was just scanning through it. I was looking for like the actual, the, what can I say? I'm trying to see how to word it. Like, okay, so like if they had like you know, accredited VSO or something like that on the actual, you see how like the, the heading on, once you open it, it says find a VA accredited. If they had wording like that when I was looking for it, then I wouldn't have, you know, scanned over it.‚Äù P13 Mobile User_

Participants were **looking for ways to bypass information irrelevant to their situation.** Some went straight to the footer while others searched, using terms such as:

- vso (#34\*)

- vso rep (#300\*)

  - _Note: ‚Äòvso rep‚Äô does not return our tool, and led to challenges._

- veteran service officer

- file claim with vso

- attorney for VA claim

_\*Numbers provided for search term ranking from May 17 - April 20, 2024_

> _‚ÄúI use the main navigation probably 10% of the time. Search is my 90% ‚Ä¶ Because once you hit it, it it, it gives you all the things that you may not need.‚Äù P8 AT Magnification User_

> _‚ÄúUsually if you go to the very bottom, it lists in a list which is quicker to go through than all of the this upper stuff. It has a, a list of things that, so I, I tend to jump to the bottom of the screen to find the list to, to look for the category I was looking for.‚Äù P11 AT Screen Reader User_

Those that did not use search wanted the tool in **places where they‚Äôd need a representative.** Such as higher on the ‚ÄòEligibility‚Äô page or at the start of the 526EZ form.

[This aligns with our most recent analytics.](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/report/content-pages/a50123418w177519031p176188361/_u.date00=20240317&_u.date01=20240421\&explorer-table.plotKeys=%5B%5D&_r.drilldown=analytics.pagePath:www.va.gov~2Fget-help-from-accredited-representative~2F&_r.tabId=navigationsummary/) With our top 3 sources of traffic being [Check claim or appeal status](https://www.va.gov/claim-or-appeal-status/) (42% of traffic\*), [How to file a claim](https://www.va.gov/disability/how-to-file-claim/) (9%), and [Survivors Pension](https://www.va.gov/pension/survivors-pension/) (7%) pages.

_\*Numbers provided for percentage of traffic to ‚ÄòGet help‚Äô page from May 17 - April 24, 2024_

> _‚ÄúI myself would put it on top, on top of eligibility. And that's, that's just my take on it because a lot of people get to this point and eligibility how to file a claim, file a claim after you file your claim. That's, that's four steps. And that scares people absolutely to death.‚Äù P4 AT Magnification User_


### Task 2: Search for a representative in your area.<a id="task-2-search-for-a-representative-in-your-area"></a>

‚úÖ **Conclusion**: All users understood the task and next steps.

Participants had feedback that will be broken down by section:

- Informational content

- Filters and sort features

- Search results

- Report outdated information button

- Representative selection and next steps


#### 1) Informational content feedback<a id="1-informational-content-feedback"></a>

There were **additional participant questions and content requests.** Feedback was **generally positive.**

Two participants **skipped the content at the top**, which impacted their understanding of available representatives.

One participant wanted all the content at the top expanded so they wouldn‚Äôt miss it.

Open questions:

1. **Accreditation** questions:

   1. Are all representatives at a VSO accredited?

   2. Can attorneys help me with a claim if they only need to be in good standing with the bar?

   3. Are attorneys accredited representatives?

2. What is a **claims agent?**

3. Are Department of Veteran Affairs **VSO Representatives VA employees?**

4. Which representative type **is best for me?** | 1) Make **free and paid** representatives more obvious.

Content requests:

1. Make free and paid representatives more obvious.
2. Provide a full **list of Veteran Service Organizations (VSOs)** and their contact information.
3. Continue to **put VSO above other representatives** to build trust in VA. |

> _‚ÄúSo I'd go here and this is good. What does an accredited VSO does? Good. What does an accredited attorney do ‚Ä¶ good. This is good clarification. You almost might wanna put this stuff on the previous \[landing] page.‚Äù P3 Desktop User_

> _‚ÄúKnowing that accredited attorneys file or charge. I think they ought to be at the bottom of the list. Most of the other Veteran service VSOs do it at no cost and that an attorney shouldn't try to make any money off of a Veteran.‚Äù P2 AT Magnification User_


#### 2) Filters and sort features feedback<a id="2-filters-and-sort-features-feedback"></a>

Participants were **generally positive towards the filters and sort options.**

Many **found location to be the most important filter** so they could easily **meet with their representative in person.** Especially those in large cities, who preferred to reduce radius down to 5 - 15 miles to **reduce travel time.**

Participants were split on whether they‚Äôd use the ‚ÄòRepresentative Name‚Äô search field, but it **didn‚Äôt deter their use of the tool.**

The only requested filter was an **option to filter by organization.** This was typically mentioned by participants who:

1. **Already had a relationship** with a VSO.

2. Wanted to **omit VSOs** they did not want to work with. Such as:

   1. ‚ÄòGovernment‚Äô (county) VSOs.

   2. VSOs that haven‚Äôt responded.

   3. VSOs that promote alcohol.

Participants who were actively searching and **had never worked with a VSO** didn‚Äôt mention searching by organization.

> _‚ÄúI guess for me personally, because my biggest concern is like the traveling part, I think, you know, using my location is like best. But I also saw once you go down you can actually, you know, sort it out better. So let's see, closest to farthest.‚Äù P13 Mobile User_

> _‚Äú\[I] probably prefer for convenience to start with somebody close. \[Do you prefer to meet them in person?] Well, initially at least over the phone and then in person.‚Äù P5 AT Alternative Navigation User_

> _‚Äú\[I want to] sort by ‚Äògovernment‚Äô and ‚Äònon-government‚Äô agencies. I don't know, some people feel a little bit better with using a government agency rather than a non-government agency ‚Ä¶ just for me if I'm gonna get help, I might want to choose maybe a government agency and somebody, it would be the opposite. They don't wanna, they want to work with an outside organization so they might wanna see those first rather than, you know, like the Washington State Department of Veterans Affairs or the VA. So you, they'd want to have the government agencies at the bottom and get the VSOs or whatever toward the top of the list. Kind of a comfort zone thing.‚Äù P3 Desktop User_


#### 3) Search results feedback<a id="3-search-results-feedback"></a>

Participants wanted additional individual representative information to **help in the decision making process.**

_Notable observation_: one participant assumed addresses were private homes.

Top requested information included:

1. Representative **website**

2. Representative **biography** including information such as if they‚Äôre a Veteran, how long they‚Äôve been a representative, photo, etc.

3. **Remote availability**

4. Representative **specialty** such as claim vs. decision review support

5. Representative **rating system**

6. Clearly **marked paid** representatives

7. **Hours of availability**

Participants also frequently **commented on representative information.**

- Participants noted **missing contact information (email, phone)** for representatives, leading to decreased trust.

  - Some suggested representatives without contact information **shouldn't be listed.**

  - Due to missing contact information some wanted a **contact form** instead.

- Large presence of representatives **from one organization in one place** raised suspicion and lowered trust.

- Organizations listed as "\*no longer recognized\*" led participants to assume **lack of individual accreditation.**

- One participant noted the **absence of their local DAV chapter** representation.

> _‚ÄúSee, there's no phone number for these people. There's one, there's one. It's all the same number. But, and see this ‚Ä¶ they got a post office box in an office. What's that good for? You know, you can't call 'em and you'd have to write 'em a note, write 'em a letter. There's no email address. And to me, a representative would have to have all of that information on that card to even be on your site.‚Äù P4 AT Magnification User_

> _‚ÄúThere was several that said no longer, no longer representative. The very last one had it on there. Yeah. That AXE POW no longer recognized. I don't even know what that means, but it, it did cause me to say why are they not recognized anymore? The person or the organization? So I would be more hesitant to select that person to represent me because of that statement. And I don't know what it is, but it's a negative thing on their thing. So I would wonder why negative, but it was on several of them. So I'm guessing the organization's not a legal organization anymore or something.‚Äù P11 AT Screen Reader User_


#### 4) Report Outdated Information button feedback<a id="4-report-outdated-information-button-feedback"></a>

Participants were **evenly split** on whether they would use the ‚ÄòReport Outdated Information‚Äô button:

- Four participants **would use the button.**

- Three were **hesitant**, wanting more information on how the report feature works, and didn‚Äôt want to ‚Äòcause problems‚Äô for the representative.

- Three would **not use it at all** either because they wouldn‚Äôt come back or they wanted a reviewing system instead.

Those hesitant or who would not use it wanted the button **in a less prominent area** such as the top or bottom of the page.

> _‚ÄúOh yes. I like doing reviews on Google, like you help other people. Especially you see a lot of bad reviews, but there's some people that have good experiences. Not everything is bad.‚Äù P13 Mobile User_

> _‚ÄúAs a new person looking for A VSO? No, because I wouldn't know their information's out unless I tried to contact them and then couldn't get through to them. \[Would you use it after you tried to call?] I doubt I would ever come back.‚Äù P11 AT Screen Reader User_


#### 5) Representative selection and next steps<a id="5-representative-selection-and-next-steps"></a>

Almost all participants would select a representative **closest to them in order to be able to meet in person.**

Some also considered organizations they‚Äôre **familiar with, belong to, or could accommodate specific needs.**

Some participants mentioned they‚Äôd **avoid**:

- ‚ÄòNo longer recognized‚Äô organizations.

- Organizations they‚Äôve had prior bad experiences with.

- Organizations that have opposing values.

For next steps participants mentioned they would **contact the representative** either through phone or email to **make an appointment.** Contact preference was determined based on which method participants determined was **most reliable or had least resistance.**

> _‚ÄúI would probably pick the ones in \[city] and talk to the two. There's two there that are listed and that's just for location. That's just because they're fairly closed, 20 minutes away from where I live. And start with them and ask them a few questions and see first of all, how responsive they are. And two, if they can represent somebody up in the state of \[state] while working with me. And again, on not only a VA disability claim, but also a what, a class action compensation suit.‚Äù P14 Mobile User Searching for Attorney_

> _‚ÄúA lot of those guys, in my experience, they get bogged down with a lot of emails, not just from Veterans, but from work and from with the claims they're working on from the VA, from so forth. And so it's just that quick ‚ÄòI am such and such. I need a VSO. Can I make an appointment?‚Äô Takes about 5 minutes. It's just that initial \[greeting]. Plus it gets you past the gatekeeper. There's always a gatekeeper. You've got to find a way past.‚Äù P16 Mobile User_


### VSO Feedback on Find a Representative<a id="vso-feedback-on-find-a-representative"></a>

During recent interviews with **VSO Representatives**, the ARF team showed the Find a Representative tool to five participants. Most feedback was **generally positive** with feedback similar to Veterans.

**All** participants were able to find themselves using the tool with some challenges:

- One participant was **easily** able to complete the task, ‚ÄúI like this, that was easy.‚Äù

- One participant struggled due to their **address being 11 years out of date.**

  - Assumed ‚Äú90% of OGCs records are outdated‚Äù so location and contact information are ‚Äúirrelevant‚Äù.

- Three participants struggled due to **all representatives having the same address** at the organization (WWP, State).

**Informational Content**

Participants **liked the definitions** of each representative type.

- One participant found the content ‚Äúwordy‚Äù and wanted it in a **bulleted format.**

**Filters and Sort Features**

Two participants who had a centralized organizational model wanted the ability to **search by organization.**

- One participant **attempted to use the name search field** to search by organization.

**Search Results**

One participant was surprised to see multiple organizations listed. Sees additional organizations as ‚Äúpartnerships‚Äù, not who they‚Äôre accredited with. **Wanted main VSO listed at the top of the list.**

**Report Outdated Information Button**

Four participants **would not use** the report button for various reasons:

- Three participants were concerned that reporting their information would **impact their accreditation status.**

  - _‚ÄúOGC scares me.‚Äù_

- Two participants **wanted to update their information**, but wanted more information on how the ‚Äòreport‚Äô would be used first.

- One participant would not use it, because they _‚Äúdo everything through OGC‚Äù._


### Task 3: Review Appoint a Representative form start page and explain your next steps.<a id="task-3-review-appoint-a-representative-form-start-page-and-explain-your-next-steps"></a>

üí° **Conclusion**: Participants would reach out to the representative for next steps or questions. They expected the representative available to **instruct them on what to do.**

All participants **didn‚Äôt notice the print and fill** option without moderator prompting.

Those **filling out on behalf of themselves** would sign-in to continue.

- One participant was a caregiver, and would use the pre-fill PDF option, then **send the PDF to the Veteran they‚Äôre supporting to submit.**

> _‚ÄúFrom here I would click the link to start the form. Like I said, everything seems self-explanatory. And if I'm going through the form and I have a question, since I do know who my VSO is, I can just call them and have them walk me through it.‚Äù P13 Mobile User_

> _‚ÄúOnce I've filled everything out, I would go ahead and submit it and I'm not sure what the next steps would be once I've submitted it ‚Ä¶ So I would go ahead and submit the form and, I would let the VSO know that the form's been submitted because they've obviously signed it and they're gonna wanna know what the status is. And then I'm going to ask them what, what our next step is so we can go ahead and move forward with our claim.‚Äù P16 Mobile User_


### User Adoption<a id="user-adoption"></a>

Response to the Find a Representative tool was **mostly positive.**

- Participants who were **actively searching** for a representative stated they‚Äôd use the tool right now.

- Participants who **already had representation** stated they‚Äôd use the tool in the future, or would refer the tool to other Veterans.

- One participant said they would not use the tool, preferring Google instead. A reason was not given.

> _‚ÄúAnd yeah, no, I think that I'm really pretty impressed with this page and wish I'd ‚Ä¶ I've only been doing this for a week or so, so it's not that I've lost a lot of time on it, but this would have been very useful. And I even thought about going to the VA.gov website to find this kind of information right up front.‚Äù P14 Mobile User_

> _‚Äú\[Now that you have this tool, is this something you could see yourself using in the future?] Yes. Yeah, I don't plan on living where I live forever, so in the future when I move, I'm gonna need something to find somebody more local.‚Äù P1 AT Magnification User_


## Additional Insights<a id="additional-insights"></a>

### Assistive Technology Findings<a id="assistive-technology-findings"></a>

‚úÖ All AT participants were able to complete the tasks on VA.gov using their technology.

**Magnification user findings:**

1. Almost all magnification participants **did not feel the need** to use their magnification devices on VA.gov due to the large and dark fonts.

2. Use of Safari ‚Äòreader mode‚Äô **blocked participant from completing the form.** Had to switch to Chrome to complete task.

   1. No fix for this, it‚Äôs a feature that hides non-essential page elements like sidebars and footers. It alters the text size and contrast for better readability. [Source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/tabs/toggleReaderMode)

> _‚ÄúWell the other side of it is I've got bifocals and I'm also probably six, eight inches away from my tablet ‚Ä¶ Yeah. And I really like the font, you know, the, your fonts are legible. They're readable and it's a very nice font. Whoever came up with that font, give him a fat raise.‚Äù P4 AT Magnification User_

> _‚ÄúThe overall, if you go into settings for the iPad, you could change the size of the fonts, you know.¬† \[On va.gov, have you ever had any issues with the font is big and things overlap?] Something I haven't seen it on va.gov no. But on other websites, yes. The things are just jumbled and, and you can't read it.‚Äù P1 AT Magnification User_

Alternative navigation participants used technology to aid in hearing or content heavy tasks. Findings included:

1. A hearing impairment participant **relied on hearing aids with closed captions.**

2. A participant with a cognitive disability used a Microsoft instance on their Mac computer to use Dragon Speech Recognition Software in a Word document. Then copy and pasted the content back to their Mac. This was to **aid in content-heavy tasks, or when they could not physically type.**

> _‚ÄúAnd your question was, how do I decide which one to do? It's on the spur of the moment. Sometimes I can type and spell, sometimes my hands won't work and I can't type at all, and sometimes my brain won't work and I can't spell it all. So I ended up getting this.‚Äù P6 AT Alternative Navigation User_

Screen reader findings:

1. Participant would **sign-in first** to ensure they‚Äôre on an ‚Äòofficial‚Äô website.

2. Participant navigated **using the footer because they found it easier** to use due to links being more exposed.

3. Participant **relies on phone numbers**, as email is difficult to navigate.

4. Participant focused on representatives that **specialize in blind Veterans** to ensure they‚Äôre getting the proper support.

> _‚Äú\[Would you sign in normally?] Yeah, that would be the first thing. As soon as I get to government sites, I usually sign in to make sure that it's my, I'm not on a fixed site ‚Ä¶ The next one had a phone number and I would probably call the phone number I and ask questions. Then from that point being blind, I don't, I have a horrible time getting through email 'cause I get so much junk mail that comes in and anytime you do stuff to VA.gov you get a bunch of extra junk mail and so I would call.‚Äù P11 AT Screen Reader User_


### Live Testing Bugs<a id="live-testing-bugs"></a>

1. Search icon in header appearing elongated on iPhone user with Chrome browser.

   1. [Status: Fixed](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C52CL1PKQ/p1713791706066419)

2. Print screen on Safari does not work on VA.gov.

   1. Status: Ticket submitted

3. Search inputs do not work if user uses autofill on Safari.

### Veteran Misconceptions of Representatives<a id="veteran-misconceptions-of-representatives"></a>

**Misconceptions of VA**

- VA will not provide a list of representatives because they don‚Äôt want Veterans to file claims successfully.

- Representatives are required to file a VA claim.

> _‚ÄúI believe the, the claim filing process is an adversarial one. So I'm skeptical about anything the VA would be sending me, to help me, you know, do battle with them. It looks pretty straightforward finding an accredited representative ‚Ä¶ I think it's a good option here. It's just, you know, I really don't trust the government anymore. It‚Äôs not that I don't inherently trust the VA, I just, you know, just like any bureaucracy, I think there's, you know, things that, that, that are by design set up to work against the Veteran.‚Äù P1 AT Magnification User_

**Misconceptions of VSOs**

- Every organization that helps Veterans with claims is a ‚ÄòVSO‚Äô.

  - _‚ÄúThere‚Äôs 7,000 Veteran Service Organizations in the United States.‚Äù_

- Not all VSOs are accredited.

- Some VSOs can charge, others can‚Äôt.

- VSOs can be ‚Äòindependent‚Äô and don‚Äôt work with an organization.

- _‚ÄúThought it was \[only] a place to go drink beer!‚Äù_

VA facility VSO confusion:

- VSO Representatives at government facilities are VA employees.

- All VSO Representatives are volunteers, except those at VA facilities.

- VSOs, such as American Legion, should not be at VA facilities.

- County VSOs can‚Äôt help with VA claims because they don‚Äôt know federal law, they can only help with local law.

> _‚ÄúOK. I have a problem with the word VSO because apparently there are five or ten different types of VSOs. I live in the state of \[state]. \[state] has an office that serves as a VSO and they help me with a claim for disability and they are paid employees of the state of \[state] as opposed to volunteers working with American Legion. Or some lawyers who is doing this stuff. And so I'm not sure if VSO is a universal word or if it's specifically to one thing or another, but my VSO is the \[county name] County agency. I don't have the name in front of me, but they're state employees.‚Äù P6 AT Alternative Navigation User_

> _‚ÄúI actually met him through, he's A VSO on his own organization. So that's who I knew him before he became a VSO. So that's who I go through. Not DAV anything. He has his own, does his own thing helping vets.‚Äù¬† P8 AT Magnification User_

**Misconceptions of Attorneys**

- Attorneys can hold up to 30% - 50% of back pay.

- Attorneys purposefully delay claims so they can get paid more.

- Attorneys need to be VA certified and accredited.

- Attorneys can‚Äôt help with VA claims because they are bar certified only, so they‚Äôll pair with a VSO.

- Attorneys aren‚Äôt accredited representatives.

> _‚ÄúAnd I've had people that know that I'm adept at all this stuff, and still they go and get some, hoodwinking attorney, you know, just nonsense. And they'll give them all their back pay. You know, they say, well, that's money that I wouldn't have had otherwise, and blah, blah, blah. And you go, you're a victim. And, they don't have to pay 'em. That's the funny thing. They're limited to, I wanna say 30% on the back pay. But a lot of these claims people, they can settle the claim in two months, but they'll hold it out for a year because there's more money in it for them to delay the decision.‚Äù P4 AT Magnification User_

**Misconceptions of Claims Agents**

- Claims agents are VSOs.

- Claims agents can take 10 - 30% of back pay.

- Little old ladies with card tables, filing cabinets, doing everything by hand, no clue if they‚Äôre accredited.

> _‚ÄúThere was one that was in \[city], \[state], and she was like 150 years old and she did everything longhand and she'd mail it in and she got good results. I was super, super suspicious of what she was up to and how she was operating. Cause she had like a file cabinet and the telephone and, you know, I didn't really, I don't think she was accredited. I don't think it was just that everybody went to her in this little town.‚Äù P4 AT Magnification User_


## Recommendations<a id="recommendations"></a>

### Quick(er) Fixes<a id="quicker-fixes"></a>

**Navigation Recommendations**

1. Landing pages

   1. Standardize titles and call-outs across pages.

      1. Recommend using [Survivors Pension](http://va.gov/pension/survivors-pension/) page as a starting point since 11% of users who see the page come to the ARM experience. Verses other top sources of traffic for the ARM experience, only 2% or less of users click through.

         1. Survivors Pension does not mention accredited representative in their link ‚ÄòGet help filing your claim‚Äô and is higher on the ‚ÄòHow do I apply for a VA Survivors Pension?‚Äô list.

   2. Recommend including ‚ÄòVSO‚Äô in the title or description for those looking for the term.

2. Search: Add ‚Äòvso rep‚Äô to best bets.

3. Footer: Update link in the footer to direct to [Get help from a VA accredited representative or VSO](https://www.va.gov/get-help-from-accredited-representative/) page.

**Find a Rep Content Recommendations**

1. Clearly mark paid and free representative options in both content and in the representative search results.

2. Provide a link to a list of Veteran Service Organizations with contact information.

3. Remove ‚Äòno longer recognized‚Äô organizations from the list.

**Appoint a Rep Content Recommendations**

1. Remove mention of ‚ÄòInsurance Card‚Äô as it is not on the digital form fill.

2. Make ‚Äòprint and fill‚Äô content more prominent.


### Future Recommendation<a id="future-recommendation"></a>

1. Provide a way for users to filter by organization.

   1. Team has discussed several possible solutions, but the soonest we can update would be with Find a Representative version 3, after Appoint a Representative digital submit.
