## Intro - 5 minutes<a id="intro---5-minutes"></a>

**Mobile users/** Thanks for joining us today! My name is Janelle and I’m a researcher working for VA.gov. \[NAME] will be joining us to take notes.

**AT users/** Thanks for joining us today! My name is Janelle and I’m a researcher working for VA.gov. \[NAME] will be joining us to assist with any technology needs today.

Before we get started a few things I want to mention:

- **Mobile users/ This session should take about an hour.** We’ll be focusing on your experience searching for a representative, such as a VSO, attorney or claims agent, as well as a new tool on VA.gov.

  - **AT users/ This session should take about an hour and thirty minutes.** We’ll be focusing on your experience searching for a representative, such as a VSO, attorney or claims agent, as well as a new tool on VA.gov.

* **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions to improve digital tools that better meet yours needs.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback. I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

- **Your participation is completely voluntary.** If for any reason you want to stop, or do not want to answer a question, please let me know. You'll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete today.

- **During today's interview, we may discuss experiences that have caused serious frustration.** I do want to know about those experiences in case there are processes we can improve in the future, but they are not experiences I can help with directly. I don’t have any access and can’t impact your benefits in any way, and wanted to provide that transparency up front.

- **Knowing this, I have \[#] teammates who would like to observe our session, but only if you're comfortable.** Would that be okay, or do you prefer to keep the session to just the three of us?

  - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.

  - If yes: Admit observers.

  - Then, ask the observer(s) to give a brief, camera-on introduction, first name and position with VA.gov.

  - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observer(s) to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth.

- **Are you ok if I record my screen and audio as we talk today for analysis and reporting purposes?** We like to record to confirm that we’ve captured your opinions accurately and sometimes share video clips with our colleagues at the VA to show user feedback. If we do this, we don’t link anything you choose to share in the session to any information that identifies you, and we remove your face and name from any videos that we share.

  - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

_Start recording._

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Do I have permission to record my screen and the audio as we talk today for analysis and reporting purposes?
