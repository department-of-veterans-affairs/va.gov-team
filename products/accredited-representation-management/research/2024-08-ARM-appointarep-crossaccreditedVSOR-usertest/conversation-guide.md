## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Janelle and I’m a user experience researcher working for VA.gov. \[NAME] will be joining us to take notes.

- **This session should take about an hour.** We’ll be focusing on your experiences as a representative that is accredited with multiple VSOs, as well as gathering feedback on a new experience on VA.gov.

  - Confirming your current title is \[title], you’ve been a representative for \[time], and currently work \[remotely/hybrid/in-person]?

  - As well as that you are accredited with multiple VSOs and help Veterans with VA Form 21-22?

    - _If no:_ Thank you so much for your interest today, but we are looking for representatives who are accredited with multiple VSOs to understand their needs today. I’m going to end here unless you have any questions or comments you want to let me know before we end?

      - Thank you for your time and we’ll reach out for future studies.

* **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions to help improve digital tools for VA.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback. I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

- **Your participation is completely voluntary.** If for any reason you want to stop, or do not want to answer a question, please let me know.

- **I want to be transparent that myself and my co-workers are here in a research capacity only.** Your honest opinions will not impact your accreditation in any way, and we want to hear about your experiences, good or bad, in case there are processes we can improve in the future.

- **Knowing this, I have \[#] VA employees who would like to observe our session, but are optional.** Would that be okay, or do you prefer to keep the session to just the three of us?

  - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.

  - If yes: Admit observers.

    - Then, ask the observer(s) to give a brief, camera-on introduction, first name and position with VA.gov.

    - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observer(s) to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth.

- **Are you ok if I record my screen and audio for analysis and reporting purposes?** We like to record to confirm that we’ve captured your opinions accurately and sometimes share video or audio clips with our colleagues at VA. Nothing is ever shared outside of VA. If we do share video or audio we don’t share anything that identifies you, such as your name or face.

  - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

_Start recording._

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Do I have permission to record my screen and the audio as we talk today for analysis and reporting purposes?
