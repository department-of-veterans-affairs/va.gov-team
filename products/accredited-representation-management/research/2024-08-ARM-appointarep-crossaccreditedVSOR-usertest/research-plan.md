# Research Plan for ARM Team, Appoint a Representative - Cross-Accredited VSOR - User Test, 08/2024


## Background

Create a high-quality accessible service or suite of services within VA.gov to serve Veterans in finding and managing their accredited representatives (Power of Attorney (POA)) and to support the deprecation of the legacy system used to take those actions.

### Veteran Journey

Veterans, their family members, and caregivers can get the help of a representative at any point in the journey where they are submitting claims. Such as; starting up, taking care of myself, retiring, and aging.

## Research Overview

### Goals

- Understand how cross-accredited VSO representatives (VSORs) intake and process power of attorney (POA).

- Understand usability, understandability, and desirability of Appoint a Representative (digital 21-22 form) with VSORs.

- _Stretch goal:_ Gather feedback on Find a Representative from VSORs.


### Outcome

- Information on how cross-accredited VSORs intake and process POA will inform how Find and Appoint a Representative tools will present VSOs for Veteran selection as well as the Accredited Representative Portal (ARP).

- User testing will inform adjustments to the Find and Appoint a Representative flows to improve usability.


### Research questions

#### General

1. How and why did the VSOR decide to become cross-accredited?

2. How does cross-accreditation impact their Veteran interactions and day-to-day activities?

3. What is their preferred contact method?

   1. How do they keep their information up to date?

4. How do VSORs interpret VA processes and terms such as certifying officials and OGC?


#### POA specific

1. How does the VSOR fill out the 21-22 today?

   1. Are there any specific needs being a cross-accredited VSOR?

   2. How is the form processed once it’s submitted?

2. Are there any challenges with the 21-22?

3. How does the VSOR communicate about the 21-22 with the Veteran?

4. Are POA requests ever declined? Why or why not?

5. What technology do VSORs use to process POA?


#### Appoint a Representative prototype

1. Would the VSOR adopt the digital form? Why or why not?

2. How does the form compare to their current experience?

3. Is there any information missing or confusing in the experience?

   1. How do they feel being a point of contact mentioned within the form?

4. Any missing features they’d like to see included?

5. Any feedback on the representative search and selection process? Including organization selection.


#### Find a Representative prototype

1. Would the VSOR adopt the search tool? Why or why not?

2. Is there any information missing or confusing in the experience?

3. Any missing features they’d like to see included?

4. How would the VSOR expect outdated information managed?


### Hypothesis

1. Cross-accredited VSORs will have unique needs with their processes, including POA.

2. VSORs will want an instant digital option for submitting a Veteran-signed POA to access Veterans' records immediately.

3. VSORs will be able to easily navigate through our form through tested patterns and informative content.


## Methodology

- **Interview /** The moderator will ask the VSOR a short series of questions to understand processes related to being cross-accredited, with a special focus on POA.

- **Usability testing** / Users will be asked to engage with a prototype to test usability, understandability of content, and desirability of features.

Remote on Zoom
