Form 21a v4 Research Plan Background\
The Accredited Representative Management Team is seeking to digitize the accredited applicant experience to expedite the onboarding process and ultimately, effectively supporting Veteran VA interactions.\
The current process to submit a paper 21a form is [outdated and inefficient](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/accredited-representative-facing/21a-digital-accreditation.md). The 21a form is the application utilized by attorneys and claims agents.\
To modernize this experience, we propose the development of a Digital 21a form. This digital form will be accessible through the Accredited Representative Portal, ensuring that applicants can easily submit the necessary information for review by the VA OGC. By implementing this digital solution, we aim to streamline the application process, reduce the likelihood of errors, decrease delays, and enhance the overall experience for those seeking VA Accreditation.\
&#x20;\
OCTO priorities\
Objective 1: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.

- ****Key Result 2:**** Number of transactions processed during our products have increased by 25%.&#x20;
- ****Key Result 3:**** All new products have a faster transaction time than those they replaced.&#x20;
- ****Key Result 4:**** No transactions accepted by our products have a fatal error.&#x20;

\
****Objective 2: Our platforms are the best way to deliver products at VA****&#x20;

- ****Key Result 3:**** Our platforms power twice as many interactions compared to last year&#x20;

\
After years of focusing exclusively on Veterans, we will build tools for accredited representatives who support Veterans. The digitization of form 21a will support the modern onboarding of perspective claims agents, and attorneys, as well as increase processing efficiency for OGC.\

\
****Veteran journey**** \
This proposed solution is not meant for veterans, though we recognize the connection between veterans and those who apply for accreditation.\
****Research Goals**** \
****We aim to:****&#x20;

1. ****Uncover assumptions, rumors, and myths ****about the accreditation process for attorneys and claims agents
2. ****Understand the applicant expectations**** upon completing the ****Form 21a v4****&#x20;
   1. Emphasis on understanding their communication expectations and preferences while completing the application in addition to post-submission
3. ****Understand the usability of Form 21a v4**** for prospective claim agents and attorneys&#x20;
4. Validate previously learned findings about**** applicant motivations and challenges****&#x20;

\
****Outcome****&#x20;

1. Findings will identify specific areas for improving the user experience.
2. We will uncover key assumptions and myths about the accreditation application process.
3. Insights will guide improvements in communication, including language and support materials.

\
****Research questions**** \
****All Applicants****&#x20;

1. What prompted the applicants to apply for accreditation?
2. Did the applicant have any trouble understanding the ****Form 21a v4**** questions?&#x20;
3. How long did it take the applicant to complete and submit the application?
4. How long did it take after submission, for the applicant to become accredited?
5. For those approved, what were the biggest pain points applying for/receiving accreditation from the VA?

1) 1) What would they change?
      1. i.e., What tips would they give someone, who was about to start this process?
   What does the applicant do (activity) when awaiting word back from OGC?
2) Did anyone reach out to the applicant for clarification after they submitted the application?
3) How are they currently notified of changes to their application status?
4) For those not in good standing with the Bar, what process is triggered?
   1. Are they able to provide supplementary information to prove their standing?
5) Would they recommend the process?

****21a usability****&#x20;

1. What are users’ expectations of the digital ****Form 21a v4**** experience?&#x20;
2. Are there any challenges with the current form experience?
3. Do users understand the next steps after submitting the ****Form 21a v4****?
4. Saving progress, do users understand how the time-saving functionality works?

****Accessibility****&#x20;

1. Are there any issues with VA Forms Library components that make the AT user experience incomplete or unable for them to finish the form?

****Language****&#x20;

1. How do users respond to the language of potentially triggering questions around imprisonment, convictions, terminations, suspensions, etc.?
2. Do users understand the legal jargon in various questions, especially in Step 6? Is this a blocker to the completion of the form? Are there better ways to word these questions?

****Hypothesis****&#x20;

1. Usability testing will show that many prospective accredited applicants can navigate the digitized ****Form 21a v4 ****on desktop devices.

1) If shown a substantial portion of their form, applicants will find the form long and desire to:

   1. See more granular data about how far through the form they have progressed
   2. Be able to jump between steps/questions

2) Applicants desire an ability to upload a pre-formatted resume that auto-fills into the appropriate form fields

   1. Desire ability to save time/energy/money
   2. Seen as an "easy-button"

3) Applicants expect email confirmation along with periodic updates notifying them of changes to their application status

****Methodology**** \
****Semi-structured interviews**** \
The interviewer will ask the participant a series of questions to understand users’ current experiences with obtaining accreditation from VA with an emphasis on clarifying users’ mental models and attitudes towards the accreditation experience.\
\
****Usability testing**** \
Accredited representatives will be asked to walkthrough a prototype of the ****Form 21a v4**** to test usability, accessibility, and comprehensibility of content. \
\
****Location**** \
Microsoft Teams. Point of contact is Marisa Dominguez @Mdomngz.\
\
****Research materials****&#x20;

- Conversation guide
- Figma Prototype link

****Recruitment**** \
****Recruitment criteria**** \
Our target audience for this research are attorneys/claims agents who:

1. Those who are seeking to apply for accreditation
2. Those who are in-progress completing their application for accreditation
3. Those who have recently completed their application (within the past 120 days)
4. Those who have recently been awarded accreditation (within the past 6 months)

\
****Recruitment approach**** \
Recruitment sources for these users may prove difficult, as these users may not currently have a relationship with VA OGC, or an outside organization, such as a law office with practicing accredited attorneys.\
Our approach will be as follows:

1. Working with OGC to identify recently accredited attorneys or claims agents.

   1. Utilize an internal list of VSO Representatives who have signed up for research participation.
   2. Expand net to include full list of VSO Representatives in order to locate specific screen requirements.

2. If necessary, working with Perigean to identify Veterans who are interested in becoming (or actively applying to be) an accredited attorney or claims agent.
