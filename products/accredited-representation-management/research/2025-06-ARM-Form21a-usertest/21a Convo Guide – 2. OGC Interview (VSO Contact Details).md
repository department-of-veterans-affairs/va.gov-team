****Intro - 5 minutes**** \
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Marisa and I’m a user experience researcher working for VA.gov. Michael will be joining us as our official notetaker.

- This session should take about an hour. We’ll be focusing on your experiences as an applicant attempting to fill out the application to become an accredited attorney with the VA.
  - Confirming your current title is \[title], you’ve recently applied to become accredited as either an attorney or claims agent?
    - If not, thank them for their time.

- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions to help improve digital tools for VA. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback. I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

- Your participation is completely voluntary. If for any reason you want to stop, or do not want to answer a question, please let me know.

- I want to be transparent that myself and my co-workers are here in a research capacity only. Your honest opinions will not impact your accreditation in any way, and we want to hear about your experiences, good or bad, in case there are processes we can improve in the future.

- Knowing this, I have \[#] VA employees who would like to observe our session, but are optional. Would that be okay, or do you prefer to keep the session to just the three of us?

  - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.

  - If yes: Admit observers.

    - Then, ask the observer(s) to give a brief, camera-on introduction, first name and position with VA.gov.
    - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observer(s) to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth.

- Are you ok if I record my screen and audio for analysis and reporting purposes? We like to record to confirm that we’ve captured your opinions accurately and sometimes share video or audio clips with our colleagues at VA. Nothing is ever shared outside of VA. If we do share video or audio we don’t share anything that identifies you, such as your name or face.
  - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

_Start recording._&#x20;

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Do I have permission to record my screen and the audio as we talk today for analysis and reporting purposes?
