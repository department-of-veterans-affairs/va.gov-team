Hello [Name], 
I’m a researcher for the VA.gov working on the accredited representative team. We’re interested in hearing your feedback on the application process for accreditation with OGC at the VA. This is part of our efforts to improve VA.gov tools for VSOs and Veterans. 
 
We’re looking for feedback from those who applied for Attorney or Claims Agent accreditation within the past 12mos. 
Additional requirements are as follows: 

* Walk through a design prototype while providing feedback 
* Are comfortable sharing their screen (we can assist with this if needed). 


Note: sessions will be hosted using VA’s Teams to satisfy security requirements. 

We are holding sessions next week starting Wednesday 6/4 through Friday 6/6. Sessions will last up to 60 minutes and you will be invited to an online Teams event. If you’re interested in participating, let me know which times below would work for your schedule. All times are in ET.
