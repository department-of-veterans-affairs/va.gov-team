-              **Michael Tri, Sr. Product Designer**

-              **Lindsay Li-Smith, Product Manager**

-              **Allison Nuttall, Program Manager**


**Research Goals**

After years of focusing exclusively on Veterans, we will build tools for accredited representatives who support Veterans. The digitization of Form 21a will support the modern onboarding of prospective claims agents and attorneys, as well as increase processing efficiency for OGC.

**Veteran journey**

This proposed solution is not meant for veterans, though we recognize the connection between veterans and those who apply for accreditation.

**Research Questions**

**We aim to:**

1. Uncover assumptions, rumors, and myths about the accreditation process for attorneys and claims agents

2. Understand the applicant’s expectations upon completing the Form 21a v4

   1. Emphasis on understanding their communication expectations and preferences while completing the application, in addition to post-submission

3. Understand the usability of Form 21a v4 for prospective claim agents and attorneys

4. Validate previously learned findings about applicant motivations and challenges

_ _

**Methodology**

**Semi-structured interviews**\
The interviewer will ask the participant a series of questions to understand users’ current experiences with obtaining accreditation from VA, with an emphasis on clarifying users’ mental models and attitudes towards the accreditation experience.\
\
**Usability testing**\
Accredited representatives will be asked to walk through a prototype of the **Form 21a v4** to test usability, accessibility, and comprehensibility of content.

 

**Hypotheses and Conclusions**

1. Usability testing will show that many prospective accredited applicants can navigate the digitized Form 21a v4 on desktop devices.

1) If shown a substantial portion of their form, applicants will find the form long and desire to:

   1. See more granular data about how far through the form they have progressed
   2. Be able to jump between steps/questions

2) Applicants desire the ability to upload a pre-formatted resume that auto-fills into the appropriate form fields

3) Applicants expect email confirmation along with periodic updates notifying them of changes to their application status

 

**Key Findings**

Finding #1: **Low-grade confusion with the form’s UI/UX**

1.        Applicants are requesting additional clarification and background information for military-related questions on the forms.

2.        There is a need for examples to be provided for more complex questions to assist applicants in correctly filling out the forms.

3.        Personal information is currently being used in a manner visible to the public, raising privacy concerns.

4.        There is a demand for an additional response option in the yes/no questions within the background section to better capture applicants' situations.

 

Finding #2: **OGC Communication processes could be reviewed for improvement**

1.        There is a notable absence of communication from the OGC (Office of General Counsel) after application submissions, leading to applicant frustration.

2.        The use of a general inbox by the OGC has led to distrust among applicants regarding the handling of their queries.

3.        Several cases have been reported where the OGC sent the incorrect applicant information in response to inquiries, indicating a breach in information management.

4.        One applicant experienced a significant issue where her application was reported lost, highlighting concerns with the application handling process.

Finding #3: **A modern and transparent application process is expected**

1.        Applicants are confused about the submission process, particularly whether applications should be sent by mail or email.

2.        There is a strong preference for in-application support, with applicants requesting access to human support specialists to assist them.

3.        The timeline for processing applications is highly inconsistent, leading to uncertainty and frustration among applicants.

 

**Details of Findings**

_Provide detailed descriptions and supporting evidence for each key finding._

**Findings:**

Finding #1: **Low-grade confusion with the form’s UI/UX**

1. Applicants are requesting additional clarification and background information for military-related questions on the forms.

This finding centers around the user asking for clarification or a better directive when answering questions within the Military and Background sections.

·      _Supporting data: (Military service experience): “It’s not immediately obvious that you can add multiple service experiences.”_

·      _Supporting data: (Impairment declaration) – “What is the extent of the condition? Diabetes? COPD - sleep apnea? Do they want my entire health history?”_

2. There is a need for examples to be provided for more complex questions to assist applicants in correctly filling out the forms.

This finding specifically speaks to the Supporting Docs Uploader and the Supplementary Statements portion of the Form 21 v4.

·      _Supporting data: “I know it says optional, but is it really optional?”_

·      _Supporting data: “It’s not immediately understood that you will be able to add multiple items.”_

3. Personal information is currently being used in a manner visible to the public, raising privacy concerns.

We spoke with two agents who mentioned they were not aware their contact details would be used for public-facing. They wish they had known and would have selected a different option.

·      _Supporting data: “_If the address is being used for public/Veteran-facing (ie Find a Rep), then that should be made very clear.”

·      _Supporting data: “Communications for what purpose? Is it for the application? Is it work-related?”_

4. There is a demand for an additional response option in the yes/no questions within the background section to better capture applicants' situations.

When speaking with the Attorneys, they expressed concern when being asked to respond to a background question without the ‘not applicable’ option. This will allow them to signify which questions apply and which do not.

·      _Supporting data: “Seeking an option outside of yes/no for scenarios where the questions don't apply.”_

·      _Supporting data: “Not all use cases will fall between ‘yes or no’”_

 

Finding #2: **OGC Communication processes should be reviewed for improvement**

5.        There is a notable absence of communication from the OGC (Office of General Counsel) after application submissions, leading to applicant frustration.

Most participants reported feeling frustrated when communicating with OGC overall. 

·      _Supporting data: “The not knowing part is awful.”_

·      _Supporting data: “What is the reason for not giving timelines when things are completed?”_

6.        The use of a general inbox by the OGC has led to distrust among applicants regarding the handling of their queries.

Participants were worried about the use of a general inbox and wondered how OGC manages the different types of inquiries from agents. There was concern their email would fall into a black hole as they only receive a generic response.

·      _Supporting data: “I had concerns about reaching out to OGC with questions because it feels like a black box (delayed/no response)”_

·      _Supporting data: “Because you're emailing OGC, it's going into the ‘hole’ -- "it's not really knowing if anyone got the email or if they're working on it. and not knowing who to check up with”_

7.        Several cases have been reported where the OGC sent the incorrect applicant information in response to inquiries, indicating that human error is causing a breach in information management.

Two different participants spoke about this experience of being emailed the wrong information.

·      _Supporting data: “I was provided someone else's information upon emailing OGC.”_

·      _Supporting data: “Got sent the wrong results for the test, and on the person’s results, they had failed!”_

8. One applicant experienced a significant issue where her application was reported lost, highlighting concerns with the application handling process.

Brief description

·      _Supporting data: “Started 2018, first time I submitted. It disappeared somewhere, and I had to apply again.”_

Finding #3:** A modern and transparent application process is expected**

9. Applicants are confused about the submission process, particularly whether applications should be sent by mail or email.

Brief description

·      _Supporting data: “It was all very confusing.”_

·      _Supporting data: “No extra directions were given after applying, just went on the website, saw what they had, and submitted the application.”_

10. There is a strong preference for in-application support, with applicants requesting access to human support specialists for escalated issues.

Brief description

·      _Supporting data: “(I) looked online for more information.”_

·      _Supporting data: “_If the user could communicate with OGC directly through the portal…”

11. The timeline for processing applications is highly inconsistent, with some applications taking up to 2 years, leading to uncertainty and frustration among applicants.

Brief description

·      _Supporting data: “(I) didn't hear back for months.”_

·      _Supporting data: “It’s a kindness to be able to know what to expect.”_

**Additional Insights**

1.        We spoke to an agent who supports international veterans.

a.        There are fewer than 10 VSO Representatives with an international phone number.

b.        The Form21 v4 will incorporate the international phone number component from the VA Design System.

** **

**Recommendations**

1. **Recommendation:** Focus on directive language by auditing the content on the questions and areas of concern. Language and tone should consider the user and the additional clarification required to confidently provide a response.

   - _Quick pass – include additional micro-copy that addresses areas of concern._
   - _Long term – consider utilizing the sidebar area on-screen for additional guidance and examples._

2. **Recommendation:** Explore possible tools to help support OGC staff with support-level communications. By streamlining the incoming queries with a digital tool or service, we will effectively dissect the user problem by viewing data around the most common reasons for contacting OGC. 

   - _Human error is a factor when managing a large volume of data entry._
   - _By providing a more granular view of the OGC inbox, the business can estimate resourcing requirements based on the reasons, frequency, and seasonality for contacting OGC._

**Next Steps**

1.        Interview OGC to better understand their side of the funnel. We are seeking to learn more about their workflow, along with their inbox policy.

2.        Explore the best solution for providing more clarity with specific questions. We will meet with our product team to determine lift for a few options.

** **

**Further research needed**

1.        It is necessary for us to communicate with the other side of the funnel, specifically with OGC, to better understand their tools, processes, and workflows.

2.        Ongoing research with Attorneys and Claims Agents is recommended to continue to uncover pain points and recommendations for improving their workflows with VA tools.
