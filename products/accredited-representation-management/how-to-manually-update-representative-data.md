# How to Manually Update Representative Data

Until the ARM products are connected to the Accreditation API, the representative data powering Find a Rep, Appoint a Rep and Rep status will need to be manually updated. This update currently takes place weekly on Fridays. 

## While connected to the VA network
Users must be connected to the VA network (either on-site or via VPN) to access the Accreditation report.

### Ensure Access
If a user does not have access to https://ogccowbd1.dva.va.gov/Reports/report/Accreditation/Accreditation they should request it from GCLAWS.  Once access is granted they can proceed.

### Download the Accreditation data as an Excel file
The report can be found at https://ogccowbd1.dva.va.gov/Reports/report/Accreditation/Accreditation.  Click on the export menu with the ðŸ’¾ icon and select "Excel" to download the report as an Excel file.
