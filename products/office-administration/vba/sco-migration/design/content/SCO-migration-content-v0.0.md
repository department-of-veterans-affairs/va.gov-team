### Begin the GI Bill program approval process {accordion}

**Where does a facility begin the process of GI Bill program approval?**     
The approval authority for GI Bill programs generally begins with the individual states via the [State Approving Agency (SAA)]() of jurisdiction.  Contact your SAA for approval of education and training programs in your respective state. They are the pathway into VA for a program's recognition and identification as being eligible for the payment of VA education benefits.

**[Education program approval guidelines >]()**   

**When is VA responsible for approval of education and training programs?**   
VA is responsible for approvals in some circumstances and for some states that do not have an SAA assigned. If you fall into one of these groups, your application will be reviewed by VA.
* [Foreign schools]()
* [California]() 

**Applications for jurisdictions where VA is acting as State-Approving-Agency (SAA):**   
* [New application for approval — accredited institutions]() 
* [New application for approval — non-accredited institutions]()
