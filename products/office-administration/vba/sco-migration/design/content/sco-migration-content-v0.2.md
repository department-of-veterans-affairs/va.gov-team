### GI Bill program approval process {accordion}

**How does a facility begin the process of GI Bill program approval?**     
The approval process for GI Bill programs generally begins with the [State Approving Agency (SAA)](http://www.nasaa-vetseducation.com/Contacts.aspx) of jurisdiction.  Contact your SAA to seek approval for education and training programs in your respective state. They’re the path to a program’s eligibility for payment of VA education benefits.   

**[Education program approval guidelines >](https://gibill.custhelp.va.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/1481/kw/1481)**   

**When is VA responsible for approval of education and training programs?**   
VA will approve schools in some circumstances and for some states that do not have an SAA assigned. If you fall into one of these groups, VA will review your application.
* [Foreign school program approval](https://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/foreign_program_approval_information_for_schools.asp)
