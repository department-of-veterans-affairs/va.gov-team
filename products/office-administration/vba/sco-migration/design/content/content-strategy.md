# Resources for Schools Page Content Strategy


### Overview

The new [Resources for Schools Page](http://www.va.gov/school-administrators) is based on the [VA.gov Hub page template](https://app.moqups.com/Rnc4BDEKrA/view/page/a8b9b0da7) and follows the VA.gov content style guide.  The [VA.gov content style guide](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/) is a valuable resource that helps to ensure that all content on VA.gov is written in the same voice.  

### Content approval process

Further discussions with DSVA will be needed before this element is leveraged.
