# School Resources Page Content Strategy


### Overview

The new School Resources Page (http://www.va.gov/school-administrators) is based on the VA.gov Hub page template and follows the VA.gov content style guide.

**Page Template:**
- Hub Page Template: https://app.moqups.com/Rnc4BDEKrA/view/page/a8b9b0da7

**Page Purpose:**
- Serves as a key landing page. Provides content and links to help users understand what information is available in the section.  

**VA.gov content style guide:**
- The VA.gov content style guide (https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/) helps to ensure that all content on VA.gov is written in the same voice.  
- _[Describe the content approval process for EDU]_ 

### Components

**Page Title:**

- The On This Page section contains links to the main sections of the School Resources page are:

**Critical Callout:**  
- Future functionality: Once the School Resources page is migrated into Drupal, the Critical Callout element could be leveraged as needed.  The Critical Callout only appears when a critical message needs to be communicated to the hub's audience.  On Beneficiary-focused hub pages, the call is primarily used for homeless or mental health services. It is not used on all hubs. Futher discussions with DSVA will be needed before this element is leveraged.
