# School Resources Page Content Strategy


### Overview

The new School Resources Page (http://www.va.gov/school-administrators) is based on the VA.gov Hub page template and follows the VA.gov content style guide.

**Page Template:**
- Hub Page Template: https://app.moqups.com/Rnc4BDEKrA/view/page/a8b9b0da7

**Page Purpose:**
- Serves as a key landing page. Provides content and links to help users understand what information is available in the section.  

**VA.gov content style guide:**
- The VA.gov content style guide (https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/) helps to ensure that all content on VA.gov is written in the same voice.  
- _[Describe the content approval process for EDU]_ 

### Components

**Page Title:**
- Name of the area.   

**Intro Text:**  
- A brief description of content on the page.

**On This Page:**  
- Contains jump links to each section of content. 

**Critical Callout:**  
- Future functionality: Once the School Resources page is migrated into Drupal, the Critical Callout element could be leveraged as needed.  The Critical Callout only appears when a critical message needs to be communicated to the hub's audience.  On Beneficiary-focused hub pages, the call is primarily used for homeless or mental health services. It is not used on all hubs. Futher discussions with DSVA will be needed before this element is leveraged.

**Key Resources for SCOs**
-	This section is comprised of the 5 most valuable resources for School Certifying Officials. 
-	These are quick links that the officials can access right away as they come into the page due to their hierarchy.

**Announcements**  
- Displays un-expired announcements  
- These announcements are also displayed on the Breaking News page. 
- Announcements may include links to resources that reside in their permanent location.
- To ensure proper display, announcement titles should be capped at 120 characters.
- As the date of the announcement is captured separately, there is no need to include it in the announcement title.
- Announcements related to events or webinars will now appear in the Conferences and events area.
-	The link to “See past announcements…” displays the Breaking News page where users can the full text of current and past announcements. 
-	Examples of announcements include: new versions of the School Certifying Official Handbook, recently revised forms, news related to legislation.

  - Training & Guides

  - Content and links appear within each accordion.
