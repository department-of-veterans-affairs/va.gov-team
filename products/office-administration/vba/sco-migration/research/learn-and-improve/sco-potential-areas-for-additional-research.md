## Other things we want to know

### Activities
- Determine if there is a way to track analytics on a page hosted in GitHub. 
   - DSVA GA SME indicated that the current GA implementation would not be the answer.
- Let SCOs know how they can provide feedback on the new page when it's launched, so we'll have user feedback for the Learn & Improve phase.

### Areas of Inquiry
* Which additional education programs and benefits could we include within the GI BIll Benefits and Programs accordion? Which could be removed?
* Would users benefit from continuing to optimize longer labels to improve how scannable they are?
* How frequently are forms used? Freqently enough that "Forms" would be a useful addition to "Key Resources", rather than having it appear below the fold?
* Is there value in having Forms on the same HTML page as Brochures and Factsheets? If they are frequently accessed independently, would users expect to see Factsheets and brochures in the GI Bill Benefits and Program area?
* Would users benefit from a description under the Forms & Factsheets link?
* Do users see the process for GI Bill program approval as a how to/procedure? If so, should it be placed at the top with other how to/procedure links?
* If there is only one procedure in the Policies and Procedures section (how to obtain GI Bill program approval), should procedure be plural? Should the Policies & Procedures section become "GI Bill Policies and Programs"?
