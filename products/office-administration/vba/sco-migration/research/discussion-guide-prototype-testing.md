# SCO Migration: School Resources Discussion Script
*October 17-18, 2019*

### Welcome and Opening Remarks (5 minutes)
*[When the participant is ready, the moderator will begin the session with the following introduction.]*

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Theresa], and I also have two colleagues on the line, Amy and Cindy. We work with the Education & Training group at the Veterans Administration and we're in the midst of redesigning the School Resources section of the VA website.  As we update pages on the site, we to share the designs with people in sessions like this to be sure the contain all of the necessary information and are easy to use.   

We’re looking for your impressions on what aspects of the website work well and where we might make improvements to make things even easier for school certifying officials & administrators.

Before we start, I’d like to mention a few logistical details:

* The most important thing for you to know for today is that we’re not testing your knowlege or ability, we’re interested in understanding how well the pages meet the needs of school administrators.  As our focus is on the design of the webpage, there are no wrong answers.  
*  By testing the site thoroughly, we hope to ensure that it’s written in a thoughtful way and gives school officials quick access to information they need to help their military-connected students.
*  We are interested in hearing your honest opinions.  And we look forward to hearing your thoughts and ideas and welcome your feedback.
*  If for any reason you want to pause or stop the session at any time, just let me know. I'll be happy to do so.

*  Do you have any questions so far? 
*  Lastly, we generally record sessions, in case we need to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. 

Are you comfortable if I record the audio as we talk today? 

Great! I'm going to turn on screen and audio recording now.  Once it's on, I'll ask again, as we like to have your verbal consent

[The meeting host will begin audio and screen recording.]

Have you participated in usability testing before? 
[Respond…   Y: How’d that go? N: No problem. ]


### Warm-up Questions (5 minutes)

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.  

1.	How many GI Bill students are at their school?
2.	How many people at your school supporting military-connected students?
3.	How long have you been a School Certifying Offcial? 
4.	Have you visited the School Administrators pages in the Education & Training section of benefits.va.gov before? 
5.	Approximately how often do you visit these pages? 
6.	What type of info are you typically looking for when you go there? 
7.	Is there any content you wish were available on the site?

Okay, let's go ahead and walk through a few scenarios.

#### Think Aloud

While you are going through the site, we ask that you please think aloud and vocalize your thoughts and decisions. The more you say about what you are thinking and wondering, the more we’ll learn.  We are interested in your first reaction, as well as what you are thinking as you engage with the content.  Sharing your thoughts aloud may seem strange at first, but it helps us understand what you are thinking and give us valuable information.

#### Prototype

Today we’ll be working with a prototype, not a real website.  We create mock-ups like these to be sure we have everything right before we code the actual website.   You may notice only certain links have been activated.  If you get to one of those links, no worries.  We’ll just mention it’s not active yet and may ask what you thought would happen when you clicked it. 

[ Start participants on VA.gov homepage.]



### Scenario #1 (5 minutes) FINDING SCO HANDBOOK

Let’s start off with one of the most important tasks. Could you use this prototype to show me how you’d go about getting to the SCO Handbook on the VA website?     

As you go about finding it, please talk aloud and let us know what you are thinking.

Observe…

Let’s say a student asks what scholarships they may be able to obtain to help with educational expenses.  Where would you go to find information that might help them?
