# SCO Migration: School Resources Discussion Script
*October 10, 2019*

### Welcome and Opening Remarks (5 minutes)
*[When the participant is ready, the moderator will begin the session with the following introduction.]*

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Theresa], and I also have two colleagues on the line, Amy and Cindy.  They are observing and taking notes. We are working on refining content within the school resources section of the VA website and are interested in getting your thoughts on some work in progress. 

We’re looking for your impressions on what aspects of the website work well and where we might make improvements to make things even easier for school certifying officials & administrators.

Before we start, I’d like to mention a few logistical details:

* The most important thing for you to know for today is that we’re not testing you, we’re trying to get a handle on how well the pages we’ll look at meet the needs of school administrators.  
There aren’t any wrong answers.  The more you say about what you see and whether it works for you, the better info we have to work with after we wrap up.  
*  We are interested in hearing your honest opinions.  Our goal is to be sure this content meets the needs of school officials and administrators. You are welcome to express any opinions you wish.  We look forward to hearing your thoughts and ideas and welcome your feedback.
*  If for any reason you want to pause or stop the session at any time, just let me know. I'll be happy to do so.
*  By testing the site thoroughly, we hope to ensure that it’s written in a thoughtful way and gives school officials quick access to information they need to help their military-connected students.
*  Do you have any questions so far? 
*  Lastly, we generally record sessions, in case we need to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. 

Are you comfortable if I record the audio as we talk today? 

Great! I'm going to turn on screen and audio recording now.  Once it's on, I'll ask again, as we like to have your verbal consent

[The meeting host will begin audio and screen recording.]

Have you participated in usability testing before? 
[Respond…   Y: How’d that go? N: No problem. ]


### Warm-up Questions (5 minutes)

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.  

*DEMOGRAPHICS*

Be sure we have this info…
-	How long have they been SCO? 
-	How many GI Bill students are at their school?
-	Possibly: How many people supporting military-connected students at their school?

*GENERAL WARM UPS*

1.	Have you visited the School Administrators pages in the Education & Training section of benefits.va.gov before? 
2.      How often do you visit these pages? 
3.	What type of info are you looking for when you go there? 

Okay, let's go ahead and walk through a few scenarios.

#### Think Aloud

While you are going through the site, we ask that you please think aloud and vocalize your thoughts and decisions. The more you say about what you are thinking and wondering, the more we’ll learn.  We are interested in your first reaction, as well as what you are thinking as you engage with the content.  Sharing your thoughts aloud may seem strange at first, but it helps us understand what you are thinking and give us valuable information.

#### Prototype

Today we’ll be working with a prototype, not a real website.  We create mock-ups like these to be sure we have everything right before we code the actual website.   You may notice only certain links have been activated.  If you get to one of those links, no worries.  We’ll just mention it’s not active yet and may ask what you thought would happen when you clicked it. 

[ Start participants on VA.gov homepage.]



### Scenario #1 (5 minutes) FINDING SCO HANDBOOK

Let’s start off with one of the most important tasks. Could you use this prototype to show me how you’d go about getting to the SCO Handbook on the VA website?     

As you go about finding it, please talk aloud and let us know what you are thinking.

Observe… 
* How do they attempt to find the school Resources page?
* How do they get to SCO Page?
* Can they quickly find SCO Handbook?

*After the participant has found the required training or given up on the task.*

### Follow up questions

2.	How do you typically get to that site? 
4.	What’s it like for you to get the info you need from that website?   



### Scenario #2 (10 minutes) FINDING REQUIRED TRAINING

As part of the Colmery Act, we understand that SCOs at schools with 20 or more GI Bill students will need to complete additional training this year.

Let’s say you'd like to complete your training for the year.  Could you walk us through how you’d go about finding the training that’s required for SCOs this year?   

Please talk aloud and let us know what you are thinking.

Observe… 
* How do they get to required training once they’re on the page? (Jump links vs. Scroll)

### Scenario #3 (5 minutes) FINDING INFO ON AN UPCOMING WEBINARS

Let’s say your colleague has signed up for an online session offered by the VA's Education Services group. You are are interested in staying up to date regarding recent changes, as well.  Using the site, how would you go about signing up to attend the same session in December?

Observe… 
* How do they return to the School Resources page when they’re done with the task?

### Follow up questions

### Scenario #6 (10 minutes) FINDING RESOURCES FOR MILITARY-CONNECTED STUDENTS

We’ve frequently heard that SCOs help military-connected students in many ways beyond certifying their enrollment.  Does that ring true for you? [respond to their input… ]

Let’s say a student asks what scholarships they may be able to obtain to help with educational expenses.  Where would you go to find information that might help them?  

*NOTE: this task will take them off the prototype to a page like https://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/non_va_resources.asp#financial_aid
When they’ve gotten there OR you’ve confirmed they are where they think they should be:*

That was great info.  Now, could you show me how you would locate Employment Assistance information?
