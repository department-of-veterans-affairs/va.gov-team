# SCO Prototype Research Plan
*October 3-25, 2019*

## Product & team
In support of the Education team’s goal of updating the School Resources pages, we plan to conduct usability testing research to evaluate the effectiveness of the School Resources prototype. Based on the research, the School Resources prototype will be revised to ensure that SCOs and school administrators can easily find the information they need to support military-connected students.

## Background
Currently, VBA GI Bill School Resources comprises three pages on benefits.va.gov.  These pages provide resource links and documents for School Certifying Officials and administrators.  The resources allow users to complete required training and certification, view upcoming events and announcements, access various tools, and support military-connected students.

During the Discovery phase, we conducted interviews with SCOs, ELRs and SCO Hotline Representatives and analyzed existing research to determine how the SCOs’ and school administrators’ ability to access necessary VA resources and support military-connected students is hindered by the layout of the information on the current School Resources pages and the prevalence of out-of-date content.  Based on Discovery research findings, we created a prototype of the new School Resources pages.  


## Hypothesis
The improved organization, layout and functionality of the new School Resources pages will increase the SCOs’ and school administrator’s ability to locate key content and functionality that allows them to perform their job efficiently and better support military-connected students.  


 
## Research questions
The research is designed to answer the following questions:
1.	How might the user interface, information architecture, design or content be adjusted to improve usability?
2.	Are users able to easily locate the School Resources area of the site?
3.	Are users able to easily return to the School Resources page after viewing resources on other VA sites?
4.	Are users able to locate the resources that enable them to perform their job and support military-connected students?


## Method
### What method of research are you planning?
We will conduct usability testing on a high-fidelity prototype or on a live site in a demo environment with School Certifying Officials. 

### Why this method?
Usability testing will allow us to ensure that users can complete key tasks and locate necessary information. We will ask probing questions, as necessary, to fully understand the participant’s’ goals and objectives.  Conducting the sessions over WebEx will allow us to observe screen actions as participants engage with the site. 

### Where are you planning to do your research?
Interviews will be conducted remotely over WebEx. 

### What will you be reviewing?
During the sessions, we will review the School Resources prototype or demo site.  
 
## Participants and Recruitment
### Participant criteria
