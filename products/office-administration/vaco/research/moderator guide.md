## Introduction

Hi there. My name is _____ and I’m joined today by _____ who will be notetaking for our discussion today. We will try our best to limit our conversation to the half hour that we have allotted. Is right now still a good time for you to talk?

As you know, we’re calling on behalf of the Department of Veterans Affairs to learn more about what it’s like for people like you to use the VA’s content, as well as va.gov. Specifically, we are interested in learning about your experiences in using VA’s content to achieve your goal, whatever that might be. Thanks so much for your time! 

I would like our conversation to feel relatively informal today. If you ever feel like there’s a question that you don’t want to answer, simply let me know. Also, if you don’t want to participate in the study, you can cut this conversation short at any point. Your input is extremely valuable, but your level of comfort in participating is more important.

We have an idea of how we would like to talk today: I’d like to start by learning more about you and your experiences, then delve into more specific ways that you have sought information. Do you have any questions about anything I’ve said?

I’d like to record today’s session so that we can ensure we hear you correctly when we review our notes. This recording will only be used for our research and will be promptly deleted at the conclusion of the study. May I record this session?

Any questions before we begin the recording?

`With permission, begin the recording... `
