# How to apply wizards: UX/Research background

*Liz Lantz, Public Websites*

*3/5/2020*

Attempts to find relevant research studies on my own were not fruitful - met with Alex Taylor, Sophia Dengo, and Ben Shyong to discuss work they completed in the past around wizards for Education and Disability benefits and answer:

- How did the wizards get to live on the content page rather than on the tool pages?
- What other options were explored other than putting wizards directly on the content pages?

## Notes

#### Convo w Alex Taylor, 3/5/2020

##### Background on earlier work

- 1990 came first then 1995, education had a similar thing [to what disability has now] where if you want this one, we can help you but if not you need to go to eBenefits
- "Where in the IA should this thing go?" was a difficult question to answer at the time, 
  - We could put them on the forms themselves - the trick with education, it's interesting, there's actually 5 different "web apps", it's not like it's the same one with different modes.  
  - You still could put it on that front page [of the tool], but at the time we didn't have a good way to tell the person had already filled out the wizard.
  - This was a compromise to put it on the eligibility and how to apply pages.
  - We just fundamentally have no control over how people drop into the site and land on it.

##### Thoughts on current initiative

- The core problem this is attempting to solve is the same everywhere - **get the person to the place they need to be.**
- Discussed the point of people using search engines to try to go exactly to the form they think they need
  - It's just like taxes! Just because someone knows the form number and looks it up, doesn't mean it's necessarily the right form. 
  - Government forms can be confusing even when you think you know what you're doing.

##### Where can I find research around this?

- Look at the studies that call out the 1990 form, that was the first one we did.
- Disability comp - probably the first study has some feedback and how people interacted with it.
- I don't think we ever did anything [research study] that was just on the wizard component - maybe we did a mini-one at the beginning of education, look around the 1990 study, in that time period.

**Had you considered a two option approach: walk me through it, or let me go straight to the form?**

They did have a link straight to the form thing that was happening, on the how to apply page. There was at one point that sort of thing thing, at the time we found it was largely driven by stakeholders because they didn't want to fill out the wizard every time.  The trade off that we made that it's not actually that onerous to fill out the wizard, at least not at that time. Now there are a lot more questions.

**Anything else I should consider?**

One thing we did have in some cases, there's some pages (e.g. [Fry Scholarship page](https://www.va.gov/education/survivor-dependent-benefits/fry-scholarship/)) that are specifically about forms, and, we don't need the wizard, we'll just link directly to the form.  Can't remember where the threshold was that they were crossing for that.
