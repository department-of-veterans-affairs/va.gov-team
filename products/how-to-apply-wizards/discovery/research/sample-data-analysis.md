# Sample Data and Analysis

## Risk Analysis

### Areas of Risk
- For the amount of tasks and devices needed in this study, the requested sample of 6-8 users and ultimately final sample of 5 users is not enough to provide confident recommendations. 
- Specifically, findings from this study cannot be confidently applied to any of the dimensions marked with a :heavy_exclamation_mark: below. 
- For dimensions that do not have a :heavy_exclamation_mark:, confidence can only be determined based on whether or not clear patterns in behavior emerge from the study between similar dimensions. Otherwise, if no clear patterns emerge, more testing will be required before providing confident recommendations. 
- No mobile testing was conducted in this study due to unforeseen constraints.
- It is uncertain what kinds of disabilities this study can confidently address due to a lack of categorical data. 

### Potential Solutions
- We strongly recommend conducting additional testing with users on mobile and assistive technologies. Ideally, we would recommend at least 4 test participants per type of technology. For example, 4 mobile users, 4 screen reader users, 4 keyboard users, etc.
- Should time constraints limit the sample size of a future test, abbreviated tests can be conducted. For example, instead of 4 test participants per type of technology, a future test could use more purposeful sampling techniques such as [deviant case sampling](http://www.qualres.org/HomeExtr-3808.html) to intentionally select a smaller group of more complicated use cases. e.g. testing with 2 screen reader users (using Wizard of Oz method for prototype), 2 mobile users, and 2 users over the age of 80. Should no major usability defects emerge from more complicated use cases, we will be able provide confident recommendations for all use cases.
- Should testing not be possible, any recommendations from the research synthesis should be delivered along with a documented list of risks to be acknowledged by the project team. Ideally more testing would be backlogged for the future.
