# Wizards: Discovery Synthesis

*Liz Lantz, UX Designer/Researcher*

Updated 3/12/2020

## Problem Statement

We canâ€™t send users directly to online applications/tools to complete education benefit and disability claim forms because our critical pre-requisite wizards exist only content heavy pages.  

These wizards are sometimes so far down these pages, some users scroll right past them.

[Our epic (#6315)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/6315) contains business goals and more details about the problem we're addressing.

## Discovery Goals

In this stage of discovery, I sought to understand:

- Are there other URLs not defined in our epic that have similar wizards we need to include in our work?
- How did the wizards come to live on the content page rather than on the tool pages?
- What other options have been explored other than putting wizards directly on the content pages?

## Relevant Meetings

3/3/2020: Mikki Northius, IA (with Kelson Adams and Aruna Kucherlapati).  [Notes here.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/how-to-apply-wizards/discovery/20200303-ia-discovery.md)

## Findings

### Answers to initial questions

**Are there other URLs not defined in our epic that have similar wizards we need to include in our work?**

Yes. The complete list of pages we will address with our work:

- https://va.gov/education/eligibility
- https://va.gov/education/how-to-apply
- https://va.gov/disability/eligibility
- https://va.gov/disability/how-to-file-claim

The wizard currently in progress for Add/Remove Dependants addresses a different use case than the wizards we're looking at here - it keeps the user in the same form rather than sending users to different places based on responses. Using a series of check boxes, the wizard complies sections of the same form for the user to complete based on their task.

Another wizard exists for [submitting a discharge upgrade](https://www.va.gov/discharge-upgrade-instructions) that we may want to consider looking at, although it since already lives on it's own page, it does not line up with our problem definition. It also requires updates to align with the DSVA's current accessibility and design best practices.

**How did the wizards come to live on the content page rather than on the tool pages?**

- There was a very high rate of users completing the wrong forms, and these content pages were where users were landing when looking for forms relevant to their task.
- This was a compromise, because it was difficult to control how people got to the site, and there wasn't a way to tell if someone had already filled out the wizard

**What other options were explored when the decision was made to put the wizards on the content pages?**

- They had a "turbo tax" approach at one point (asking user if they want to be walked through or if the user wanted to go directly to the form)
  - Driven by stakeholder request because they didn't want to have to keep going through the wizard
  - Ultimately it was decided the wizard wasn't that hard to go through (although it has since grown)


### Additional information

- It is very difficult to find relevant research studies in our research history document. After dedicating a full day to combing through the existing research, I have decided to rely on conversations w/ the IA and UX resources available.
- We need to consider that content pages exist that are specific to a form and link directly to the form itself, e.g. the [Fry Scholarship content page](https://www.va.gov/education/survivor-dependent-benefits/fry-scholarship/).
- Veterans receive mailers with urls sending them directly to the online form (bypassing the wizard).


## Outcome

- We have a complete list of the pages in question
- No major findings in terms of other options previously explored
- Leaning toward the "Turbo tax" approach - will discuss with team
- Mapped wizard outcomes, URLs impacted, and possible flow: https://app.mural.co/t/vsa8243/m/vsa8243/1583339328670/26c12cb441183d0cccb2c0f38d1fb28dff4454f9
- Additional questions to discuss with team
   - What prevents users from erroneously submitting other forms on va.gov that don't have these wizards?
   - Do we need to wrap the Higher Level Review wizard shown in the Sprint 16 demo on 3/10/20 ([video here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UhFD634WSVVQchORAvGzGScmN-3cntRB/view), approx 28m mark)
