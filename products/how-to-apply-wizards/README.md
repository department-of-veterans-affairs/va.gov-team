# "How to Apply" Wizards Product Outline

> Up to date [Product Epic is here](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vft-59c95ae5fda7577a9b3184f8/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/9665).

## Overview
Help Veterans and others find the right online experience to apply for benefits by making it easier to complete "How to Apply" wizards. 

We'll make this happen by iterating content pages to quickly navigate users to tools pages where wizards will help determine the right online application for a Veteran's situation. 

## Problem Statement
> From [Wizards: "How to Apply" and "Can I file a claim online?" - Discovery Readout](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/how-to-apply-wizards/discovery/wizards-discovery-readout.pdf)

Veterans learn about benefits and eligibility requirements from detailed content pages. 
These pages may include prerequesite questions potential applicants *could* answer before intiating the "actual" application process. 
Answers to these questions help determine where applicants are taken in order to apply i.e. which form or online tool is most appropriate. 

A helpful example [is available here](https://www.va.gov/education/how-to-apply/). Applicants navigate to the wizard and complete a series of questions to determine which education application is most appropriate for their needs.  

- They are currently four (5) urls where in-content "How to Apply" wizards exist:
  - https://www.va.gov/education/eligibility
  - https://www.va.gov/education/how-to-apply
  - https://www.va.gov/disability/eligibility
  - https://www.va.gov/disability/how-to-file-claim
  - https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/higher-level-review/

Veterans typically land on these content pages while researching benefits. 
However, these pages may not always make it easy for Veterans to find these helpful in-content wizards (and subsequently the right online application). *data point --> % of views on https://www.va.gov/education/how-to-apply/ that result in outbound navigation to application*

How might we make the Veteran experience of starting online applications more seamless? 


<!--*In a couple of sentences, describe the Who, What, Why, and Where of the challenge / pain point you seek to address. [Here's a sample problem statement definition activity you can try on your team to help generate this](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/problem-framing)*-->

<!--*Follow your problem description up with a "How might we... _______" statement re-framing that challenge as an opportunity. Don't hint too much at what the solution might be, you should have enough of a focal point here to guide your ideas, but plenty of freedom to think laterally and innovatively as you experiment and prototype later.* --> 

## Assumptions
- Veterans fill out applications that don't apply to their situations (riskiest)
  - Source: Contact Center, respective product teams e.g. Disability, Education
- It's difficult to find "How to Apply" wizards
  - Source: Google Analytics (bounce, etc.)
- Benefit content pages are unnecessarily detailed
  - Source: research studies, Google Analytics (scroll depth, etc.)

<!-- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumtion w/your initial set of functionality* -->

## Desired User / Business Outcomes

**Why would a user want to use this?**
**With this problem solved, what should users be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?**
**Why would your business want this to exist?**
**With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?**

- It's easier for Veterans to find the right online experience to apply for the benefits they're looking for 
- Veterans aren't spending time filling out the wrong online application

## Undesired User / Business Outcomes

- It's harder for Veterans and others to find/start applications for benefits they seek  

## KPIs
- *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
  - Ratio of appropriate/inappropriate disability benefit applications started/completed
  - Ratio of appropriate/inappropriate education benefit applications started/completed
  - ~% of "How to Apply" wizard content pages resulting in applications started~

## Solution Approach

- (1) Develop user flows that outline proposed approach of moving wizards to the Applicaton/Tool landing pages - https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vft-59c95ae5fda7577a9b3184f8/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/6315
- (2) Validate assumptions -- as much as possible -- with usage data (Analytics Team) and user insights (Contact Center)
- (3) Determine if a prototype can/should be built to validate assumptions -- or if we can/should build a live MVP version on site with traffic throttling


--- 

## Go-to-market Strategy
- *How are Veterans and others using this product going to know it exists?*
  - Proposed hypotheses make it easier for Veterans to apply for benefits/submit a claim from content pages where they're most likely to end up in their research.  
- *What marketing, outreach, or communications are necessary for this product to be successful?*

## Target Launch Date
- *What is your target launch date of your MVP/iteration?*
  - to be determined
  
- *What is your date for when you'll evaluate impact after launch?*
  - to be determined
