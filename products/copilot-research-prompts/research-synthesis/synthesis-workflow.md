# Recommended Workflow for Using These Prompts

## Step 1: Individual Session Analysis
1. Start with the [Core Prompt Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/copilot-research-prompts/research-synthesis/copilot-research-synthesis-prompt.md#-core-prompt-template) for each session
2. Save Copilot's analysis as `session-[number]-analysis.md`
3. Review and annotate with your observations

## Step 2: Cross-Session Synthesis
```
I have [NUMBER] analyzed sessions. Please synthesize across all:

[PASTE ALL INDIVIDUAL ANALYSES]

Provide:
1. Meta-themes across all sessions
2. Confidence levels for each finding
3. Contradictions or tensions
4. Strongest patterns
5. Executive summary of collective insights
```

## Step 3: Stakeholder-Ready Insights
```
Transform this research synthesis into stakeholder-ready insights:

[PASTE SYNTHESIS]

Create:
1. 3-slide executive summary
2. Top 5 actionable recommendations with effort/impact
3. Risk mitigation strategies
4. Success metrics to track
5. 90-day roadmap
```

## Step 4: Research Repository Entry
```
Format this synthesis for our research repository:

[PASTE SYNTHESIS]

Include:
- Title
- Date
- Method
- Participants (anonymized)
- Research questions
- Key findings (bulleted)
- Recommendations (prioritized)
- Impact assessment
- Tags/keywords for searchability
- Related studies
- Next steps
```

## Pro Tips for Researchers

### ðŸŽ¯ Prompt Chaining
Start broad, then narrow:
1. First prompt: "What are the main themes?"
2. Second prompt: "Deep dive into [SPECIFIC THEME]"
3. Third prompt: "Generate solutions for [SPECIFIC ISSUE]"

### ðŸ”„ Iterative Refinement
- Run initial analysis
- Ask: "What did I miss?"
- Request: "Challenge these findings"
- Probe: "What alternative interpretations exist?"

### ðŸ“Š Validation Prompts
```
Review this analysis for:
- Confirmation bias
- Sampling bias
- Recency bias
- Interpretation alternatives
- Statistical significance (if applicable)
```

### ðŸŽ¨ Visualization Requests
```
Create a:
- Journey map in ASCII/markdown
- Affinity diagram structure
- 2x2 prioritization matrix
- Emotional journey graph description
- Persona summary card
```
