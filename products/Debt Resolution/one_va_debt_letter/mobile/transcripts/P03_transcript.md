0:00	"Recording, right."	  	  
0:02	OK.	  	  
0:02	"So now that we are recording, are you OK if I record our audio and visual today?"	  	  
0:09	"Yes, great."	  	  
0:10	And would you be OK if we potentially show any clips from this to our VA partners?	  	  
0:16	Sure.	  	  
0:16	"All right, great."	  	  
0:17	"So first, just a a general question at whatever level you're comfortable with, I'd love to know just a little bit about you as a veteran."	  	  
0:25	That could be what branch you served and when you retired or separated.	  	  
0:30	"Well, yes, I started the \[redacted\] and I left 2012, 2012."	  	  
0:37	"OK, got it."	  	  
0:38	Great.	  	  
0:39	And what sort of experience interactions have you had with Veteran Affairs since then?	  	  
0:46	"Yeah, just getting insurance, getting the bill, GI Bill, you know, look, things like that."	  	  
0:50	Just try and get the benefits.	  	  
0:51	So I've just been getting benefits from the VA.	  	  
0:54	MM Hmm.	  	  
0:54	"OK, great."	  	  
0:55	"And what sort of sorry experience have you had using the website and or the mobile app doing the claims, you know, settle appointments, set appointments on there, just load up my information, mostly claim stuff and all that."	  	  
1:14	"And you know, just get my get my insurance stuff, get my medical stuff off there too."	  	  
1:19	OK.	  	  
1:21	And do you are there times that you are specifically choosing to use the app versus the website?	  	  
1:29	So it depends on everything website.	  	  
1:31	"You know, if I got on my computer, you know, that's not it's more convenient wise."	  	  
1:35	I could take my time.	  	  
1:36	It's much easier to upload my documents.	  	  
1:38	"So definitely the computer, I could update my, you know, my forms, anything I need because I scan it on there."	  	  
1:47	So it's much easier to do all that stuff on my computer versus the app.	  	  
1:51	"OK, got it."	  	  
1:52	So in what instances would you be using the app?	  	  
1:56	"You know, if I'm not, I'm away from the computer, I have to check some statuses, you know, just check, you know, appointment stub or just try to get information."	  	  
2:04	"So I'm more using the app for that and everything, you know, just trying to get data and all that versus on a, on a laptop, you know, from, from, from away from the laptop."	  	  
2:13	So I'll use it for that instance.	  	  
2:15	"OK, so, so if you're, it sounds like make sure I'm going to get this right."	  	  
2:19	"If you are, let's say at home near a laptop, are you always going to use the, the website or Yeah, definitely laptop and everything because I work from home."	  	  
2:29	"So, you know, it's just easier to pull it up while I'm working and I can pull up the browser just more convenient."	  	  
2:35	"And I'm, you know, pulling my medical records, all my personal information, you know, it's all my laptop versus my mobile."	  	  
2:42	"OK, so the, the app, it sounds like only if you're not near your computer."	  	  
2:46	"Yes, correct."	  	  
2:48	"OK, great."	  	  
2:49	So now we're going to move to the financial portion of the discussion.	  	  
2:52	And I want to make sure that you're only sharing what you're willing.	  	  
2:55	"I'm like I said, I have no information about you or your finances with the VA."	  	  
3:00	Yep.	  	  
3:01	"So I'd love to know just a little bit at again, at whatever level you're comfortable, what sort of experience you have had with benefit over payments over the years."	  	  
3:11	I had some this year and all that.	  	  
3:13	"You know why I had came across some hardship earlier this year, You know, I couldn't, I was trying to keep up financial wise."	  	  
3:21	I made a mistake earlier this year.	  	  
3:23	So I had some over some depth due to a financial clear.	  	  
3:28	"I had to pay other things, other things need to be taken care of, you know, rent and some other personal things."	  	  
3:34	"So that's how I kind of ran to the depth of of, you know, going through the VA."	  	  
3:39	So this happened this year.	  	  
3:41	"OK, got it."	  	  
3:42	And do you recall how did you back up?	  	  
3:47	Did you know that this debt was going to be incurring incurring?	  	  
3:53	I really did.	  	  
3:54	"I just really lost count, just like just life changes happened earlier this year."	  	  
3:58	"And I just kind of be honest, which I kind of forgot about it."	  	  
4:01	"You know, just try to keep up the stuff that's in front of me."	  	  
4:04	"And I totally kind of forgot pretty much, to be honest with you."	  	  
4:08	"OK, got it."	  	  
4:09	So do you recall how you first learned that you had this overpayment?	  	  
4:14	What was it?	  	  
4:15	I think it was the e-mail or mail.	  	  
4:17	"Got it in the mail, I think."	  	  
4:18	I believe it was in the mail.	  	  
4:19	"Yeah, I got it in the mail."	  	  
4:20	So that's how I found out about it.	  	  
4:22	"Oh, OK."	  	  
4:22	Got it.	  	  
4:22	So it sounds like you did not know that that was coming before this letter arrived.	  	  
4:28	"I believe I knew it was coming, but it's my my stuff was going on."	  	  
4:32	So I kind of forgot about it.	  	  
4:34	So it just kind of landed in my lap.	  	  
4:36	"You know, it's one of those situations."	  	  
4:39	"Got it, Got it."	  	  
4:39	OK.	  	  
4:40	"And when when you did receive this communication, was it clear what your options were regarding the debt?"	  	  
4:48	Not really.	  	  
4:49	"I just called them, you know, I just tried to call as soon as possible."	  	  
4:51	"I just gave them a call, OK."	  	  
4:53	"And then once you did call, how how much did you did you understand like what your options or what was going on at that point at the time, you know, they try to offer some financial options that I could do so that was they told me back then."	  	  
5:11	"So I won't so it won't go to the credit Bureau, it won't be reported."	  	  
5:15	So that would be that they gave me back then OK.	  	  
5:19	"And so that were, were those options presented in in the letter or you only learned about them once you were on the phone?"	  	  
5:26	"On the IT was on the phone, everything."	  	  
5:28	So definitely on the phone.	  	  
5:30	"OK, got it, got it."	  	  
5:32	"And then since then, what sort of communication regarding this debt have you received since then?"	  	  
5:40	"You know, they sent me some stuff, whatever."	  	  
5:42	"Then I just kind of got on a payment plan trying to, you know, attack it before it got worse."	  	  
5:47	"Got it, got it."	  	  
5:47	OK.	  	  
5:48	"And was that payment plan, was that something you set up when you first called them?"	  	  
5:51	"Yes, it is."	  	  
5:52	Do I call them?	  	  
5:52	"Yes, I did yes."	  	  
5:54	Great.	  	  
5:54	"OK, OK."	  	  
5:55	"And then similar question and again, what at whatever level you're comfortable, what sort of experience have you had with medical co-pays from VA?"	  	  
6:06	Medical co-pays.	  	  
6:07	"I know a little bit, I mean a little bit and everything, you know, you got the the the upfront and everything."	  	  
6:11	So I know a little bit about it.	  	  
6:13	"You know, I I usually have the the money for medical co-pays."	  	  
6:18	"OK, and then so when you do receive them, do do you know how you learn about any co-pay bills that you have?"	  	  
6:27	How I learned about?	  	  
6:28	"I mean, you know, it's just like, you know, just like anything else, whatever you know, we would have provided outside or whatever they kind of give to you, then you get the bill and got the co-pay in there."	  	  
6:37	It shows the co-pay they take how much you owe.	  	  
6:39	"OK, and do you always know when these bills are coming?"	  	  
6:43	Are they ever a surprise to you?	  	  
6:45	"I mean, not really."	  	  
6:46	"It's just like, all right, I go see him just now."	  	  
6:47	"It's going to come when it's coming, everything right."	  	  
6:49	So I don't know if it's the next day.	  	  
6:51	I don't really pay attention to that.	  	  
6:52	"I just know all right, it's coming."	  	  
6:53	But I don't know how long it's going to take a week or two weeks.	  	  
6:55	I'm not really keep up with that.	  	  
6:57	"OK, got it."	  	  
6:58	"And then so is it always clear what the co-pays are for when when the bills do arrive, it just says co-pay it Don't tell me exactly what it is."	  	  
7:06	So it's not really clear to me from my understanding.	  	  
7:08	Interesting.	  	  
7:09	OK.	  	  
7:10	And similar questions before any are are any financial options are those clear to you when these bills do arrive?	  	  
7:20	"Financial options that that I recall, I don't remember to have financial office on here, just that I remember."	  	  
7:28	"OK, got it."	  	  
7:29	"And then any is outside of I know you said you, you received the bills in the mail."	  	  
7:34	Is there any other communication you received regarding the bills?	  	  
7:39	I saw the mail on the app.	  	  
7:43	I'm trying to think that's it.	  	  
7:45	Yeah.	  	  
7:46	"OK, got it."	  	  
7:47	"And are you, are you, are you logging into the website to see anything or are or only when, when the, the, the physical letters arrive."	  	  
7:56	"I usually the physical letters and all that, that more catch my attention 'cause like I say, I don't build my VA app like that unless like I go to it and all that."	  	  
8:03	"So I check my mail everyday, you know, just everyday life and all that."	  	  
8:06	So that's more preferred.	  	  
8:08	"Got it, got it."	  	  
8:09	"OK, Excuse me."	  	  
8:12	All right now I'd like to ask you about times that you're actively managing these Denton bills.	  	  
8:16	"And when I say manage, this could be like calling the phone, calling VA on the phone or maybe maybe making payments or like looking at your finances in general."	  	  
8:26	"So when when you're looking to do any sort of management of your finances, when are you typically doing it?"	  	  
8:33	"And that could be like time of the day or night or time of the month or like any if if anything prompts that to me, I feel like more beginning of the month and all that because, you know, usually most of my bills are due in the beginning of the month."	  	  
8:47	"But you know, Rand and electricity and all that."	  	  
8:49	So I try to do more at the beginning of the month.	  	  
8:52	"OK, got it."	  	  
8:53	"And are you, so are you, are you paying everything at that time, including any majority like yeah, rent, electricity, cell phone, all that."	  	  
9:02	So those the three I paid most and everything that's like my big chunk and all that.	  	  
9:06	Then I got some bills that's due in the middle of the month.	  	  
9:09	"Oh, you do."	  	  
9:09	"OK, got it."	  	  
9:10	And what's your method or how are you keeping track?	  	  
9:14	"Like I know you say you have some bills due in the middle of the month, some at the beginning."	  	  
9:17	What is your method to to keeping track of when things are due?	  	  
9:21	"Like I say, I have all my bills in general, like I move them in a certain like I have these bills."	  	  
9:28	"I moved the due date around this time and when due date, you know, like mid of the month."	  	  
9:33	So I have a due dates that's in the middle of the month.	  	  
9:35	I got due dates at the beginning.	  	  
9:36	"So I, I, I purposely do that, especially with the people I do, I have my services with."	  	  
9:44	"OK, got it."	  	  
9:45	"And is this something like when you are paying the bills, is that where like physically where are you when you're, when you're making these payments or, or, or, or setting up these payments?"	  	  
9:57	"Oh, you stay at the house doing this."	  	  
9:59	"OK, OK, got it."	  	  
10:01	And are there any other things I know of course you you said the due dates either the beginning of the month or middle.	  	  
10:07	Is there anything else that prompts you to take action on on any of these debts or bills?	  	  
10:14	"Anything else that you know, like I say when I you know, I go on there."	  	  
10:18	"Hey, due dates due this and that, unless you know, you're going to get, you know, what do you call it?"	  	  
10:23	You get charged interests or anything like that that's gonna definitely prompt me.	  	  
10:27	"You know, they're gonna charge me interest or, you know, they're gonna threaten me."	  	  
10:30	They're gonna cut your electricity off.	  	  
10:31	"You don't pay with them ten days after, you know, those little things like that, that stuff are gonna grab my attention."	  	  
10:36	Mm hmm.	  	  
10:37	"OK, got it."	  	  
10:38	"So thinking about both the overpayment debt and the co-pays, I'd like to know just how you think of them."	  	  
10:46	Like are you thinking of them as something similar in your head or do you think of them as two separate things in your head?	  	  
10:54	"Oh, sorry, answer that question."	  	  
10:55	"Sorry, I'm trying to stay in the question."	  	  
10:56	"That's yeah, that's good."	  	  
10:58	So I'll just say let's pretend you have both co-pay bills and the money you need to pay for the overpayment debt.	  	  
11:06	"Like in your mind, are those the same type of thing or do you think of them as as as separate things?"	  	  
11:15	"I mean, I kind of think as a separate."	  	  
11:17	"OK, got it."	  	  
11:20	"And can you, can you tell me more about that about about why you're thinking of them as as separate as opposed to similar like co-pays is more upfront and all that."	  	  
11:28	"Like you know, you go in doctor's office, right?"	  	  
11:30	It's co-pay.	  	  
11:30	"Hey, you know, it's $40 co-pay that's more upfront and everything, right."	  	  
11:34	"And the stuff that's, you know, overpayment, whatever, that's kind of do you know, it's like, all right, you know, you go pay that whenever you know."	  	  
11:41	So that's that's how I think of it.	  	  
11:44	Got it.	  	  
11:44	OK got it.	  	  
11:45	And are you are you making those payments at at the same time or different pay or different times?	  	  
11:51	"Oh, different times, different times."	  	  
11:52	OK.	  	  
11:53	And is that is that just due to the due date or are there other reasons that you make them at different times?	  	  
11:58	I feel like the co-pay is more cheaper than the overpayment.	  	  
12:01	So co-pay is always cheaper.	  	  
12:02	So that's why I can afford to make the co-pay than the other one.	  	  
12:06	"OK, got it, got it, got it."	  	  
12:09	"And is there in, in terms of managing any debts and bills that you have, is there anything that is challenging or confusing in terms of keeping track of everything?"	  	  
12:21	"Oh, anything that's challenging everything."	  	  
12:23	"I'm trying to think of it just sometimes you get lost in the mix and all that, right, 'cause you know, I know my recurring bills, that's everyday life."	  	  
12:35	"But VA bill, it's like it's like once or twice a year, something like that versus the current bills where hey, does rent is due every month, electricity bill due every month, you know, water bill this and that."	  	  
12:49	"So those things I can remember, remember, but you know, the medical bills, stuff like that, sometimes I just get lost, you know, I kind of get lost and kind of forget about them."	  	  
12:57	"OK, got it."	  	  
12:58	"And are there things that you could think of that would make it easier to like as, as you say, not not lose track or or get lost, just get reminders, You know, maybe I get reminders on here, you know, just say, hey, you know, we got a bill due the next this net, you know, if you came forward this bill, you know, we got to finance you got other ways to help you, you know, with your hardship or something like that."	  	  
13:21	"Some of that nature and all that, you know, some of that nature."	  	  
13:24	"OK, So it sounds like you would want more communication as to what sort of options."	  	  
13:28	"Yeah, yeah, yes, got it, got it."	  	  
13:31	OK.	  	  
13:33	All right.	  	  
13:33	So we're going to move into looking at a prototype and I'm going to have you share your screen.	  	  
13:41	Have you shared your screen from Zoom before?	  	  
13:43	"Yes, I have."	  	  
13:44	"All right, let me have you go and do that and then we'll get a couple steps in there."	  	  
13:50	Let me know if you need any assistance with that full screen.	  	  
14:06	"All right, it's coming up."	  	  
14:07	Let's see.	  	  
14:08	"Oh, right."	  	  
14:08	"Oh, we've already got Figma."	  	  
14:10	Perfectly perfect.	  	  
14:11	So you have read my mind.	  	  
14:13	This is the next step.	  	  
14:14	"OK, let me have you go tap the login to Figma."	  	  
14:17	"I'm going to give you a test account, OK?"	  	  
14:25	And the screen just went black.	  	  
14:26	So hopefully that will resolve itself soon.	  	  
14:31	"Is it is, is something showing up on your end?"	  	  
14:34	"Yeah, yeah."	  	  
14:34	e-mail password.	  	  
14:35	"Yes, it is."	  	  
14:36	And I'm not seeing it here.	  	  
14:38	That is interesting.	  	  
14:41	"OK, well, let me, I will try giving you the login and maybe it'll resolve itself by the time we're done."	  	  
14:48	Hopefully.	  	  
14:50	OK.	  	  
14:50	"So for the e-mail address, it's VA test zeroyeahohsorrysovasandveteranaffairsohohohvaokvatest000thenumbers000yep@gmail.com Gmail."	  	  
15:13	"Oh, I'm going to tune at at at gmail.com and password and the password."	  	  
15:21	"So this is going to be it's kind of long, but it is a pattern on the phone."	  	  
15:25	So hopefully it'll be sort of easy.	  	  
15:28	So capital A and then everything else will be lowercase Z as in Zebra SXDCFV.	  	  
15:45	And then moving to numbers 2468 the was it the S or X?	  	  
15:57	We said earlier it's both actually.	  	  
16:02	"So it, it makes it makes a zigzag pattern on the keyboard."	  	  
16:06	"If if you I, I I can start over."	  	  
16:08	It's not a problem.	  	  
16:09	"OK, yeah, let's do one more time."	  	  
16:10	"Yeah, I think I messed up."	  	  
16:11	"I think I put 2S, Yeah."	  	  
16:14	So what we're doing is I'm sorry.	  	  
16:16	"I know that it requires so many letters, and I was trying to try to make it as easy as possible."	  	  
16:21	"OK, so capital AZ, So sorry."	  	  
16:25	"After this, everything will be lowercase ZSXDC FV2468 2468 Yeah all right."	  	  
16:48	"I should be good in why I come here Browser OK, you can see also use the Figma desktop app."	  	  
16:55	"Well, I don't know this means update."	  	  
16:58	I don't know what this OK did it show up?	  	  
17:02	This shows not yet Hell still hasn't shown up.	  	  
17:05	So try can you switch to the the zoom app?	  	  
17:09	Maybe you'll just try.	  	  
17:11	"OK, does anything let me go here?"	  	  
17:16	"Let me stop and try again, OK?"	  	  
17:18	That's my plan to everything restart everything.	  	  
17:23	"All right, Here 'cause when I went to a share one app, no entire screen, OK, Entire screen."	  	  
17:32	"Oh, yeah."	  	  
17:32	There we go.	  	  
17:33	Perfect.	  	  
17:33	You are here.	  	  
17:34	"OK, So switch back to Figma."	  	  
17:35	"OK, All right, so let's go to."	  	  
17:37	"Oh, OK, let's go."	  	  
17:39	"Yeah, that's what that's yeah, that's what it took me to."	  	  
17:41	"So, oh, update or switch browsers."	  	  
17:44	You can also use the Figma desktop app.	  	  
17:47	Figma requires Safari or Chrome.	  	  
17:52	"All right, let's see."	  	  
17:54	"Oh, do we have to actually do?"	  	  
17:59	Let's see my guess.	  	  
18:01	I'm going to talk to my colleagues here.	  	  
18:03	"Dave, if you want to unmute, my guess is that this would be too long to do an update that I should switch to another option."	  	  
18:13	"Would you agree with that, Dave?"	  	  
18:15	Yeah.	  	  
18:16	I guess I'm wondering which browser you have installed right now.	  	  
18:23	"Yeah, I got Chrome."	  	  
18:24	You have Chrome.	  	  
18:26	"It's usually pretty quick to do an update to Chrome, if you don't mind doing that."	  	  
18:31	So I'll just click on Chrome.	  	  
18:32	Do I just click on Chrome?	  	  
18:33	"Yeah, I think hopefully that link works."	  	  
18:36	Yeah.	  	  
18:36	"OK, let's see about this."	  	  
18:39	"I mean, I got Chrome on here, so why ask me this?"	  	  
18:41	That's weird.	  	  
18:42	"Yeah, I think it's just an outdated version of Chrome, and it wants you to have an updated version."	  	  
18:49	"OK, so."	  	  
18:50	So I'm on here now.	  	  
18:51	So how do I get the Figma to work on here?	  	  
18:54	"Oh, that's interesting."	  	  
18:57	"OK, so it did."	  	  
18:58	"Emily, does this run within the Chrome browser?"	  	  
19:04	The entire no like it's supposed to be?	  	  
19:09	"Oh, well, it's probably it's opening."	  	  
19:15	It's probably opening a web view because it needs to ask me for A2 factor authentication.	  	  
19:23	So maybe that's what it's opening.	  	  
19:28	"OK, so it is."	  	  
19:29	Look.	  	  
19:29	OK.	  	  
19:30	I am.	  	  
19:31	It's an interesting.	  	  
19:32	So Phil is logged in.	  	  
19:35	"Yeah, it's just."	  	  
19:36	"Yeah, it's just giving me."	  	  
19:38	Yeah.	  	  
19:39	Yeah.	  	  
19:39	"Oh, my goodness."	  	  
19:40	What is going on?	  	  
19:40	"Yeah, Yeah."	  	  
19:44	I wonder what would happen if I just sent the prototype link.	  	  
19:51	Let's just.	  	  
19:51	We're going to see what happens.	  	  
19:54	We're going to try a little experiment.	  	  
19:55	"OK, so I am sending you, I just sent you a link in the zoom app."	  	  
20:00	So if you could switch back to the Zoom app.	  	  
20:07	"OK, OK, I see it here and then Oh yeah."	  	  
20:11	So the chat there we go.	  	  
20:12	"So tap on that very long URL, open up Chrome."	  	  
20:17	"Oh, sorry."	  	  
20:18	"So just tap once and it oh, oh, OK, I was I was gonna copy."	  	  
20:24	"Yeah, I'll try to."	  	  
20:25	"Yeah, I should have just typed one."	  	  
20:26	You're right.	  	  
20:27	I should have just tapped once.	  	  
20:28	Maybe that might work out.	  	  
20:29	"Yeah, try that."	  	  
20:30	We'll just.	  	  
20:30	We'll see what happens.	  	  
20:33	Still wants to go back in.	  	  
20:36	"Yeah, it's not."	  	  
20:38	I tapped it and it can't.	  	  
20:41	Did that happen?	  	  
20:42	Got it.	  	  
20:43	"All right, let's try one more thing and then I'm going to switch to showing my phone."	  	  
20:49	"All right, switch back to Zoom."	  	  
20:52	"OK, so I want you to copy that link, which I think you accidentally did before."	  	  
20:59	I think you so copy text and then maybe try going to your Chrome browser.	  	  
21:07	And no way.	  	  
21:08	"Now she would probably want, yeah, OK, so put the."	  	  
21:12	"So paste that into this URL, and we're going to see what happens."	  	  
21:20	"Oh, hell, I should do that in the beginning."	  	  
21:21	"All right, All right, all right."	  	  
21:22	OK.	  	  
21:22	We're gonna we're gonna go with this.	  	  
21:24	We're not gonna touch it.	  	  
21:27	"Gotta love, gotta love technology, son of us."	  	  
21:28	"OK, Thank you for holding out with me for that one."	  	  
21:32	Let me just.	  	  
21:33	So I just gotta rearrange a window again.	  	  
21:35	"OK, So now that we've got this up, thank you for your patience there."	  	  
21:40	So we're gonna pretend that you have some overpayment debt from some disability and education benefits and then medical co-pays from some regular doctor visits and prescriptions.	  	  
21:51	So that what you're looking at now is really just a like a testing dashboard.	  	  
21:57	This sort of kind of looks like the app.	  	  
21:59	"Part of it looks like the app, but part of it is not related to the app whatsoever."	  	  
22:04	"So if you were looking on the phone, let's say you wanted to check out your finances, what do you think would be important or backup?"	  	  
22:18	Would there would there be time that you would want to look at everything together?	  	  
22:22	"When I say everything that would be both overpayment debt and co-pays or do you think you would prefer to look at each one individually, each co-pay bill separately, each overpayment separately."	  	  
22:34	"Like like I said on this one problems upper right, you got the co-pay separately, overpayment separately."	  	  
22:39	I don't want to look at combined.	  	  
22:42	So I prefer co-pay separately than overpayment separately.	  	  
22:46	OK.	  	  
22:46	"And oh, go ahead."	  	  
22:48	Yeah.	  	  
22:48	"So in this way, like as I saw right here, these are co-pay $75 due for two co-pay bills and all that, then, you know, this is the due for three overpayments, right?"	  	  
22:58	So in in this way.	  	  
23:00	Yeah.	  	  
23:00	"OK, got it."	  	  
23:01	And can you say more about why you would prefer to look at them separately?	  	  
23:05	"Because I, I, it'd be very confusing, you know, to have them all both combined and all that, you know, so I'll just wonder like, hey, COVID pills or something like I got like AI feel like I'm comfortable, like I paying it off right now versus overpayment where I got any time and all that."	  	  
23:20	"So I want them to separately, it is just for just financial confidence wise."	  	  
23:26	"OK, got it, got it."	  	  
23:27	"And so I'm, I'm not going to have you tap quite yet, but what would be your expectation of what you will find inside the combined statement button there combined statements."	  	  
23:38	"I think the combined statement is going to show all both of them, right?"	  	  
23:41	"It's going to show both bills all together, you know so that's what I'm expected to see."	  	  
23:46	OK got it.	  	  
23:46	So let me have you tap into combined statement.	  	  
23:49	"OK, great."	  	  
23:51	OK.	  	  
23:51	"And so you can Scroll down, look around here, have a look around and then I'll I'll and if you want to share any thoughts of what you're seeing will be charges a patient in your description."	  	  
24:04	It's the copay 35A dollar $20 information for $5 due.	  	  
24:12	This is copay for Raphael 401010104050 dollars due on the payment charges 1500\.	  	  
24:24	"OK, so just three dollars decrease dates balance decrease hundred hundred."	  	  
24:34	"So there's all overpayment, GI Bill overpayment charges post 911 most recent payment may not reflect here."	  	  
24:42	OK amount Chapter 25 education depth over pay charment.	  	  
24:46	"So, so, so on this, what do you call it?"	  	  
24:51	What's this name called?	  	  
24:52	"We call it Yeah, combined."	  	  
24:54	"Yeah, yeah, combined statements."	  	  
24:56	It's just got a breakdown from both the the Co payment information and over and the overpayment where it got the information where the charges come from right here.	  	  
25:05	So this is what I expected just showing.	  	  
25:08	OK.	  	  
25:09	"You know, just all both, all combinations showing where it came from, days and times."	  	  
25:14	"Got it, got it."	  	  
25:14	And I know you said before that you would prefer to see things separately.	  	  
25:19	"Now that you are looking at this, would there be anything here that would make this a useful tool seeing everything together?"	  	  
25:27	"Like I say, you know, if I wanted to, you know, download and everything like, hey, just download how to statement, like I'm trying to get financial help and all that."	  	  
25:34	Whatever.	  	  
25:34	"This'd be a good where I could download it and print it out and send it to, you know, somebody that's going to help me with payment."	  	  
25:40	I got proof and all that.	  	  
25:41	So I see that that that's a good way reputation or just me downloading to know.	  	  
25:47	"Hey, just have it on my fridge, right."	  	  
25:49	"Hey, I know this is do this and that, you know, diligent wise where I could keep up with it, right."	  	  
25:53	"So that's one of the ways I could, you know, combined wise, I, I everything's on here, but I, like I said before, I'd prefer everything to be separated off that 'cause I want my copays separate than my overpayment."	  	  
26:05	"OK, got it."	  	  
26:06	"So it sounds like just to make sure I understand you, you might use this to download to send it to if, if, if someone's helping you out with financing or like put it, putting it on on on your fridge just as a like as, as a general."	  	  
26:19	"OK, got it."	  	  
26:20	"OK, great."	  	  
26:21	Got it.	  	  
26:22	"And then looking at at everything, I know you read through briefly what is here on the scale to one to five, How overwhelming, if at all, does this feel to you?"	  	  
26:35	"I mean, Pfizer over whatever because you got all both of them at once and all that."	  	  
26:38	"So that's all like I, I prefer to be separate, but it's definitely overwhelming because there's a lot of information on here."	  	  
26:45	"OK, got it."	  	  
26:46	And then what actions or decisions might you make if you were viewing all this?	  	  
26:52	I know you said you might print things out or send it to people.	  	  
26:55	Is there anything else that you might want to decide and or take action on from this page?	  	  
27:01	"Yeah, I will."	  	  
27:02	"You know, I'll go review and resolve Co payment bills and all that."	  	  
27:04	So I'll review them and resolve them guarantee or I'll call them and discuss payment plans.	  	  
27:08	So either I'm going to go those two routes.	  	  
27:12	"OK, got it."	  	  
27:13	And then any other thoughts on how you would prefer to interact with this?	  	  
27:19	I know you said you would print it out so you'd have a physical copy.	  	  
27:23	"Any, any other ways that you might want to interact with all this information as it's presented here?"	  	  
27:30	"Like I said, print it out or like I said, review and resolve and see what, what, what they have to offer."	  	  
27:34	"So I'll, I'll choose that option up there and also review and resolve depth, you know, going there and see, you know what they have, you know, what's doing there also."	  	  
27:44	So what all should they have?	  	  
27:45	"So, so, you know, those are things I would, you know, check out and see what they have."	  	  
27:49	"OK, got it."	  	  
27:51	And would this be something that you might want to look at on your phone?	  	  
27:55	Would this be just your desktop?	  	  
27:56	What's your preference there?	  	  
27:59	"I mean, it could be both ways, depends on, you know, what I'm doing, you know, if I'm in the car or away from the laptop I can do on my phone or, you know, if I'm home, you know, I'll take my time."	  	  
28:07	"And you know, I could have open, you know, 2 screens, you know, I have three screens."	  	  
28:11	"I could open it up and look at some stuff, open up a new tab where I right click on the review and just to see what it says while while I'm looking at these things here."	  	  
28:19	"So, you know, I could, you know, both ways."	  	  
28:22	"Got it, got it."	  	  
28:22	"OK, so I know you mentioned you might download this, the button at the very top of this screen where it says download combined statement or maybe scroll."	  	  
28:32	I know it's very long.	  	  
28:33	Scroll all the way back up.	  	  
28:35	"Yeah, there we go."	  	  
28:36	What is your expectation of what this button would do?	  	  
28:40	The download combined statement or exactly what what are we looking at?	  	  
28:43	"It's going to download it, you know, it's going to be in APDF file."	  	  
28:46	"You know it's going to be download everything you PDF file where I can print, you know, or I can save it on my computer."	  	  
28:54	OK.	  	  
28:55	"And would you, are you ever using PDFs on your phone?"	  	  
29:01	"No, I'll use more."	  	  
29:02	It's more laptop wires and all that because I have the PDF Nitro and all that.	  	  
29:07	"So I you know, some more Oh my more on my computer because much bigger than on my phone."	  	  
29:13	So it's definitely going to be more on my phone.	  	  
29:14	"I mean on my on my laptop than my, you know, on my phone's mobile."	  	  
29:19	"OK, good."	  	  
29:21	Have you have you ever used PDFs from your phone?	  	  
29:23	Do you recall?	  	  
29:24	"I have like, look at certain bills, whatever, you know, but like I said, I got a scrolling, you know, I got to zoom in the recent stuff and all that because, you know, I have a, you know, Android phone, but I just prefer it on the bit screen versus little screen, you know, like I put my glasses on."	  	  
29:38	Sure.	  	  
29:38	"OK, got it."	  	  
29:39	Let me have you tap that download combined statement just to see what it is.	  	  
29:43	"And yeah, tell me your thoughts on how this compares to what you were expecting."	  	  
29:50	"Yeah, like I said, I, you know, usually like download a little bit, but it took it straight there and all that."	  	  
29:55	"So, you know, it got everything here."	  	  
29:57	"So like I said, I got to zoom in to see stuff, whatever."	  	  
29:59	That's why I like the like the laptop and all that.	  	  
30:02	"It's just much easier to read on here, but it's kind of hard to read on the phone."	  	  
30:06	So.	  	  
30:07	"But, you know, this is what I expected, you know, have other information, you know, for the copay and the benefit overpayment and all that, right."	  	  
30:14	"But this is more like I said, more laptop."	  	  
30:17	"OK, got it."	  	  
30:18	And is there any information here that you would want to make sure to have to make this useful for you information.	  	  
30:26	"I mean, the main information is, you know, you got your information about your co-pay, how much amount you owe now, right?"	  	  
30:31	"So that's that's the big thing, right."	  	  
30:32	"So how much you pay, you know you owe 75."	  	  
30:35	"You know all the information, right."	  	  
30:36	"So maybe I don't say maybe you know, Hey, have the number you can call like hey, you know, if you want to call for, you know, assistance this and that the number, the telephone number should be on here."	  	  
30:46	That that's on the page.	  	  
30:47	The one I had the number so that that helps out.	  	  
30:51	Got it got it.	  	  
30:52	I think it's on here already.	  	  
30:53	It's probably on here.	  	  
30:54	"See, I can't zoom."	  	  
30:55	It won't let me zoom in.	  	  
30:56	I think that's the number.	  	  
30:57	"Yeah, actually, so that that's a that's a prototype thing."	  	  
30:59	"If you tap once in it, it'll do a magic zoom if you ever go yes in in real life, you know you you could actually like do the bigger zoom."	  	  
31:08	"Yeah, OK, yeah, that's just a prototype thing."	  	  
31:12	OK.	  	  
31:13	And then what in what situations might you use this PDF versus the page that we just looked at with with everything listed in a list?	  	  
31:27	"Situations like I say, if I'm just trying to just log in and look at some information, whatever, I just go on the web page just like, OK, how much I owe doesn't that, you know, and that and that and that route and everything."	  	  
31:40	"But if I'm trying, I'm taking my time and I need to look over over the things and all that, then I'm definitely going to use the PDF."	  	  
31:48	"So I could, you know, just trying to, you know, print it out right quick so I could be at home and look at some information."	  	  
31:55	"Got it, got it."	  	  
31:56	"OK, and let me have you tap on done at the top."	  	  
32:00	"Oh, done."	  	  
32:01	"OK, Yep."	  	  
32:02	"And then press the home button on the at the bottom, the blue button."	  	  
32:06	"OK, and then tap into overpayments."	  	  
32:09	"We're just going to look quickly at this actually, since you, you said you would when we, when we started talking, you said you would prefer to look at things separately."	  	  
32:18	"So let's just look at at just this, this top, this top debt, the disability compensation and pension."	  	  
32:24	"Go ahead and look into look into the details of this and to get a sense of, of what you're seeing here."	  	  
32:32	"Oh, oh, just go, oh, scroll through here."	  	  
32:33	OK.	  	  
32:36	Oh yeah.	  	  
32:36	Compression perhaps.	  	  
32:37	So 3 is supposed to be 3 with 90\.	  	  
32:39	"OK, so, yeah, this is the Ferrari car, whatever this is the three overpayment charges here."	  	  
32:45	"You know, it's pretty stressed, successful, planatory, you know, you know, just doing the 14 current balance, chapter 5 education."	  	  
32:53	"So you know, this is something, you know, it's pretty simple."	  	  
32:56	"You know, there's two types of bills to have."	  	  
32:58	"You know, I can read details, resolve overpayment."	  	  
33:00	"So it's pretty, you know, it's very transparent."	  	  
33:02	"It's not, it's not too overwhelming."	  	  
33:04	"Oh, OK."	  	  
33:04	This is not too good.	  	  
33:06	"Maybe the, the, the top debt."	  	  
33:09	Let me have you tap the review detail just to look at.	  	  
33:12	I think that's OK.	  	  
33:13	Yeah.	  	  
33:13	Tap the review details.	  	  
33:15	Yeah.	  	  
33:15	And just Scroll down here again.	  	  
33:16	"Just want to get a sense of of, of what this looks like so you can compare it to the combined statement we looked at earlier."	  	  
33:25	Yeah.	  	  
33:25	Balance now or request help by November 14th.	  	  
33:27	"All right, so ask for help."	  	  
33:29	"Transaction history, overpayment letter history."	  	  
33:31	No right responsibility.	  	  
33:33	"If you need help, call this number, A-100 number."	  	  
33:36	"If you're outside, call this number or contact us through the VA."	  	  
33:41	OK.	  	  
33:42	Transaction history 50\.	  	  
33:44	"OK, Yeah."	  	  
33:45	Transaction history.	  	  
33:46	There.	  	  
33:47	Overpayment letters and find dates and summaries and letters sent to your address.	  	  
33:50	"OK, first the mail."	  	  
33:51	"OK, they got the letters they showed that sent to you."	  	  
33:55	OK.	  	  
33:57	"I might have this overpayment balance, you know."	  	  
34:00	"So yeah, this is yeah, this is pretty, yeah, pretty simple, not too much going on."	  	  
34:05	"OK, yeah, got it."	  	  
34:07	"So again, comparing this what you're looking at to the combined statement, any further thoughts on when you might use one or the other and just the, the, the differences in terms of how you might use everything."	  	  
34:21	"So this comparative, this is much easier to go through separate, but you know, it's at ease, you know, it's not too overwhelming or anything."	  	  
34:27	"I can see, you know, the three different, three different payments I owe."	  	  
34:32	And also I could just go individually look at the information.	  	  
34:34	"So, you know, I could concentrate on one at a time."	  	  
34:37	"So I just feel more this is more I feel more comfortable just using this in general because just, you know, it is at ease."	  	  
34:45	"It's not too, too much stuff going on."	  	  
34:48	"I could just, you know, contracted the big 1 and I bet myself on the, you know, the big one in the middle then in the least."	  	  
34:55	"So, but this definitely, just definitely enjoyable."	  	  
34:58	It's not too intimidating.	  	  
34:59	Got it.	  	  
34:59	"OK, that's stupid."	  	  
35:01	"OK, any thoughts on actually, well, tell me your thoughts on how much you are trusting the information you're seeing here versus the information on the combined statement, if there's one that you might trust more than the other more, more I trust more and more because you know, it's broken down individually."	  	  
35:21	"Like if I can let me let me go back, I can explain it more so well, I was trying to OK, so I trust Morris like I, I'm actually looking at individually post 911."	  	  
35:35	"I could go in here, view details this and that, or I could resolve it, overpay me."	  	  
35:39	I could just do it like that.	  	  
35:40	"I feel like the the the combined statement, it was very long."	  	  
35:43	"It just had, you know, just everything all showed up front, you know, on here, you know, I just got read details."	  	  
35:49	"So I want to see the information like a look at the transaction history just like that over my, you know, got the, the the arrow downs and ups."	  	  
35:55	"So if I want to collapse it, expand it, I could just look at the here it is much easier to go through versus the the other one."	  	  
36:03	"You know, this is something I trust more because it's not thrown in my face like the other one."	  	  
36:08	"Got it, got it."	  	  
36:09	OK.	  	  
36:10	"And then any would there would there be any time to think that you might look at that, that combined, that full combined statement?"	  	  
36:21	"And if you want to tap on the home, you can go and look at the combined statement again."	  	  
36:24	"All right, oh, this one right here, this one OK, maybe maybe it's like, hey, you know, if I need a I'm trying to think any time I would click on this, I don't know if I would click on the combined 1."	  	  
36:40	"I feel like the other one, the individual would just look better for me when I'm trying to just look, just look at my, you know, my just my over over depth bill versus this combined, because I have to go all the way to the bottom just to get to it and everything right."	  	  
36:58	"You know, it's just, it's just too long for me and everything."	  	  
37:00	So I feel like I wouldn't I wouldn't use this because it's just too long.	  	  
37:04	"You know, I prefer the other one."	  	  
37:06	It's just more ease.	  	  
37:06	"It's just more ease and I could collapse and and, you know, expand and collapse."	  	  
37:11	"OK, got it."	  	  
37:12	Since you mentioned it's very long.	  	  
37:15	"So with the with this with this example, the the first debt we did put about a full year of history."	  	  
37:22	What's your thought on just how much history you would want to see for the with the transactions?	  	  
37:28	"I mean, here is fine and everything, you know, years is most manageable."	  	  
37:32	"I mean, I can imagine you put the whole time where you've been in since you got to be a best friend."	  	  
37:36	That would be very old when whatever.	  	  
37:37	"But like I say, if you go to VA for a lot too many times, that could be very overwhelming."	  	  
37:42	"You know, just you know, that's just me personal and all that."	  	  
37:45	But a year is fine.	  	  
37:46	That's OK.	  	  
37:47	"OK, great, great."	  	  
37:48	All right.	  	  
37:48	Now let me have you tap on home again.	  	  
37:51	We're going to look at some new designs.	  	  
37:54	"So now in just a moment, we're going to have you go to some designs that are not yet built anywhere."	  	  
38:01	"Let me have you tap on the yellow, the future version B on the right hand side."	  	  
38:07	"OK, so we're and this is a potential combined statement that you might see in the app or maybe scroll around, look around this and just share any thoughts that you have on this one."	  	  
38:22	"So on this one, all that right up, you know you could switch copay overpayments here."	  	  
38:26	So I do it like that.	  	  
38:28	I could go between these two and I know it's not at the top.	  	  
38:31	"You know, if I want to view the combine, you know, PDF stuff, it's the option if I want to PDF statement, I want to download that right, you know, view it right here and I want to a combine statement A is that something different or we will yeah, we're we're going to get to that in just a moment."	  	  
38:47	"Yeah, OK, OK, yeah, I was just wondering."	  	  
38:49	"But you know, I like, you know, the the tabs, which is OK there the copay."	  	  
38:53	"I mean, I have an issue with that."	  	  
38:54	"You know, go back and forth, see the things you know, copay review resolve copay appears right here and you know, claim your outpatient clinic O payment chapter 5 OK, these also pretty much these the three things that the overpayments, you know, came from over here."	  	  
39:12	"So you know, it just been pretty much breaks down and these Co payments came from these two clinics."	  	  
39:17	So which is cool.	  	  
39:18	"You know, it's easy to yeah, it's pretty simple, not too complicated."	  	  
39:22	Got it.	  	  
39:23	"And then so comparing this to the first combined statement, the long I know I mentioned with with the first combined statement, it was very overwhelming."	  	  
39:32	How about this one?	  	  
39:32	Any thoughts on how overwhelming if if at if at all this one is?	  	  
39:37	"It's not, you know, you go between these two and everything."	  	  
39:39	"I mean, they're both here."	  	  
39:40	"You know, I could see, hey, these three are here."	  	  
39:41	"I could just click here and it pretty much, you know, I could collapse it."	  	  
39:45	"It shows everything right here, you know, so it's not like showing like the other one."	  	  
39:48	It shows the whole thing.	  	  
39:50	"So, but this, this, this, this is manageable."	  	  
39:53	"OK, got it, got it."	  	  
39:55	And how likely do you think it would be that you might use this in the app?	  	  
40:00	"The the this combined statement, It's very likely now that I'll go between these two and everything now it's pretty much tell you, you know, these the bills that came from, you know, and here, you know, Co payments and goes to tab up and down."	  	  
40:11	"I mean, I mean to tap the left side."	  	  
40:12	"I just, I very likely use this."	  	  
40:14	This is very easy to use.	  	  
40:16	"Great, great."	  	  
40:17	And any thoughts on in what instances you might use this within the app?	  	  
40:23	"You know, if I'm trying to log in, like hey, I'm trying to see hey, you know what this bill come from and I'm trying to look information, hey, how much I own this bill from GI debt bill or disability here, you know, trying to see which bill is the biggest and all that."	  	  
40:33	I could easily attack and all that.	  	  
40:35	"You know, just trying to gather information here, you know, or go to co-pay."	  	  
40:39	"Hey, you know, to go my co-pay and pay my co-pay right quick, whatever."	  	  
40:42	"OK, we'll see where it came from and make my payments."	  	  
40:44	"So yeah, those answers."	  	  
40:46	"I just want to do a quick check up, which is easy."	  	  
40:47	I could just go back and forth.	  	  
40:49	"OK, got it, got it."	  	  
40:51	"And since we talked about trust before, how about this one?"	  	  
40:55	Any anything that would I'll compare.	  	  
40:59	I'll ask first.	  	  
41:00	"Yeah, thoughts on how much you trust this information versus like you can get just your overpayment bills that we did a few months."	  	  
41:09	I definitely trust this and all that.	  	  
41:10	"It's just much easier to go through there, go switch back and forth."	  	  
41:14	"You know, this is just good on good understanding."	  	  
41:16	"You know, I'm not overthinking, so I think just something I'm comfortable with."	  	  
41:21	"Got it, Got it."	  	  
41:22	OK.	  	  
41:23	And let me have you Scroll down to the bottom.	  	  
41:24	We're going to look at the version A Yeah.	  	  
41:28	So tap combined statement A to get the other version.	  	  
41:33	And this.	  	  
41:33	Yeah.	  	  
41:33	I'm curious if you what differences you might see here and how it compares to the other version.	  	  
41:40	So this one copays.	  	  
41:43	It's the same.	  	  
41:43	It's all together.	  	  
41:44	"Oh, OK, try to think so this is you see this bill statement because you're trying to enroll in the requirements this and that certified dollars then show the bill."	  	  
41:52	"I'm trying to think, I mean, this design's a little bit different than the other one."	  	  
41:57	"It just kind of OK, what just happened?"	  	  
42:02	"Oh, oh, there you go."	  	  
42:02	"Benefit due to changes your benefit results, you paid this and that."	  	  
42:05	So I guess it's getting an explanation.	  	  
42:07	This was getting more explanation on this one versus the other one.	  	  
42:12	"I mean, it's still showing the you know, the patience, you know how much I owe in here."	  	  
42:15	"But this getting explanation at the top, you know, yeah, OK."	  	  
42:20	And thoughts on how useful or not that that explanation is.	  	  
42:25	"I mean, you should build stuff because you turn and roll and probably group of ground Co payments."	  	  
42:28	"I mean, I kind of already know."	  	  
42:31	"I mean, it's just kind of it's just extra, you know, I, I would, you know, yeah."	  	  
42:36	"OK, got it."	  	  
42:37	So thoughts on which version you prefer?	  	  
42:41	"The one without the explanation versus which, yeah, I like the other one without explanation, you know, saying like, yeah, OK, got it."	  	  
42:48	So we're going to imagine that you have full control over what you are seeing here.	  	  
42:53	"Thoughts on what you what, if anything, you might add, remove, or change to make it useful for you?"	  	  
43:00	This particular one?	  	  
43:02	"Yeah, Yep."	  	  
43:02	"Or actually, if you want to, if you want to Scroll down, we'll, we'll go back to version B, since I know you said you liked that one."	  	  
43:07	"OK, Version B so this version B, this is the one I just looked at or it's the same one this so this is version B the so you're you're seeing the explanation because this one can be expanded or collapsed and you have expanded this."	  	  
43:26	"Oh, OK, that's what it is OK, that's what it is OK yeah, I like this one up."	  	  
43:31	"You know, if I want to expand to see that, but the other one I think the other one is just right there in my face."	  	  
43:35	It's just right there.	  	  
43:36	"So I definitely like this one in general and everything because it's like, OK, you know, I know that's here, but I'm more concentrated on, OK, what's this do review called, you know, make the payment or resolve the coal bills and all that."	  	  
43:48	So this is more more better for me and all that versus other one.	  	  
43:51	You just throwing that in my face.	  	  
43:52	"I already know that that just kind of that just, you know, just what's the point showing that to me when I think, but I prefer the this one."	  	  
43:59	This is what better one than the other version.	  	  
44:01	"OK, good."	  	  
44:02	"And are there things that could make this even more useful to how you might use it could be things that are you want more information, you want less."	  	  
44:11	Some things moved around.	  	  
44:13	"I mean, I mean, I say less than anything."	  	  
44:15	"I'm whole point is, Hey, I got to build the student whatever, right?"	  	  
44:18	"So, you know, give me options how to resolve my Co bill or payment plans and just let me know, Hey, where it came from and how much it is."	  	  
44:25	"What's just what's just providing me, show me how much I got billed for these two clinics, you know, 2 clinics."	  	  
44:30	I'm going to go get my my services and all that.	  	  
44:33	So those are the main things I care about.	  	  
44:35	"You know, you know, how can you help me get out of depth how to resolve this?"	  	  
44:39	"You know, little things like that, those things to what, what I care about."	  	  
44:43	OK.	  	  
44:43	And the way that it is presented here.	  	  
44:47	Would you want more?	  	  
44:49	"Yeah, I guess what, what what else might you want?"	  	  
44:51	"Like when you mentioned you want to you want to know where the bill is coming from, how to resolve that?"	  	  
44:58	"How, how how is this possibly not serving that need for you right now?"	  	  
45:05	"I mean, me personally, I think it it is serving for me, OK."	  	  
45:08	"Because you give me the options to review it and resolve the Co bill, you know, and tell me where it's coming from and how much I'm getting charged, you know, previous balance and all this information."	  	  
45:21	"So give me a breakdown of the co-pay for my different providers and you know, and just you know, and let it right here say, hey, you need help or call this number or this and that."	  	  
45:30	"So let's get this is to provide all the information that I need and everything, you know, just to be honest with you."	  	  
45:37	Got it.	  	  
45:38	"OK, So it sounds like you wouldn't change anything here."	  	  
45:40	"Yeah, No, I wouldn't change anything."	  	  
45:41	"Yeah, this is I like to keep it simple."	  	  
45:44	We call it KISS in the \[redacted\]	  	  
45:46	Keep it simple stupid.	  	  
45:47	"So, you know, you want to, I don't want to be too much, you know, too overbearing, whatever."	  	  
45:52	"I want to keep it simple, like, all right, this is my bill."	  	  
45:54	"This is the breakout of my bill, you know, and you know, how can I resolve it?"	  	  
45:59	"You know, or I have a pay right here."	  	  
46:00	Or what about solutions?	  	  
46:02	Right.	  	  
46:02	So those are things little things I care about.	  	  
46:05	"OK, good."	  	  
46:07	"And then thoughts on I saw you, you noticed the the download PDF toward the top."	  	  
46:13	Any further thoughts on if you might use it from this version?	  	  
46:18	"And if so, when you might use the PDF statement?"	  	  
46:21	"I mean, I might use it, you know."	  	  
46:23	"Hey, I finally get an overview right quick and everything if I want to look at them both, right?"	  	  
46:26	"But I know me, I just I definitely want to look at an individual and I always been like that and all that, but I want to get a quick overview and let me look at them both and all that."	  	  
46:32	"So I could see OK, all right, my co-pays and all that."	  	  
46:35	Whatever.	  	  
46:36	I'm being whole people.	  	  
46:37	"I'm showing to somebody, you know, or show it to my family member, whatever."	  	  
46:40	"But other than that, I'm just going to use I'm do I'm used to separate thing."	  	  
46:44	That's just me.	  	  
46:46	"OK, so some more if you're if you're showing it to other people, but for your own personal use, you want to look at them separately."	  	  
46:51	"Yes, got it."	  	  
46:53	"OK, and let me excuse me, let me have you tap on or actually before you get to that."	  	  
47:01	"So thoughts on this the the two different tabs versus the oops, the information that's that's exactly where you want to go."	  	  
47:13	"So you are, I was going to ask you about comparing this versus the two tabbed combined statement."	  	  
47:21	"Oh, the two tabs."	  	  
47:22	"Oh, OK."	  	  
47:24	"Oh, I mean, I, I really like this one also, you know, the two tabs where I could go down everything, but this was good too."	  	  
47:29	"I mean, I like both the two tabs where I can look at the copay, you know, the overpayment, they know here, you know, this is the overpayment."	  	  
47:37	"You know, I like this also."	  	  
47:38	So I kind of like them both right there.	  	  
47:40	"You know, it's still keeping the air thing separate, you know, each bill separate, you know, in general, you know, from post 911 and all that and I could resolve it."	  	  
47:48	I can invent individual concentrator on there.	  	  
47:50	So I kind of like them both.	  	  
47:51	"OK, got it."	  	  
47:52	Any thoughts on when you might choose to use one over the other?	  	  
47:58	"You know, what can, how do I go back to the other one?"	  	  
48:02	I believe you tap the payments on the bottom right.	  	  
48:09	Yep and then combined statements part way down just just blow words.	  	  
48:15	"Yeah, the word the word combined statement and toward the bottom of the page."	  	  
48:18	"Yep, OK, Yep, Yep, OK, overpayments."	  	  
48:29	"OK, I don't know why I just did that this one because is this more this is bum is showing you it's in bold resolve O payment."	  	  
48:37	It's it's more bold than the other one where I was trying to I don't know.	  	  
48:42	I clicked on something.	  	  
48:43	Whatever this is more blunts.	  	  
48:45	"The more bold make me make me want to do, you know, make actions than the other one because it's just the blue, just the highlight here."	  	  
48:57	"Yeah, it's kind of hard to explain, but this is more me make me want to go make more action, be more click on it than the other one."	  	  
49:04	Got it.	  	  
49:05	OK.	  	  
49:06	"So do you know if there would be a time that you would actively choose like to look at all of your overpayments like this versus going into the payment, Sorry, the combined payment and looking at one of the two tabs, this one, you talking about comparing this one to the combined payments, correct?"	  	  
49:25	"Yes, correct."	  	  
49:26	Yep.	  	  
49:28	"I, I don't know, like if I'm the one to look for an individual, I'm trying to make a payment for one, then yes."	  	  
49:33	"But if I'm trying to make the whole pay, the whole thing that might go to combined payments where I can make the make the pay the whole bill off, then I'll probably go to that."	  	  
49:41	"OK, got it, got it."	  	  
49:42	All right.	  	  
49:44	And then any thoughts on like within the app where it would make sense to you to find a combined statement?	  	  
49:56	"What makes me define the combined statement where each of my, where in general it'd be at the top."	  	  
50:01	"Oh, at the top, you'd want to see the combined statement."	  	  
50:04	"Yeah, at the top and everything."	  	  
50:05	Like I want to do combined statements.	  	  
50:06	Yeah.	  	  
50:06	"I mean, sorry at the bottom because you got the you got the split, you got the coal pill, then the overbed."	  	  
50:10	"But the combined, if I want to see the combined statement, just be at the bottom."	  	  
50:15	OK?	  	  
50:15	Like like you mean at the like at the bottom of this page here?	  	  
50:18	"Yeah, yeah, yeah."	  	  
50:19	Bottom of the page here.	  	  
50:20	"Oh, OK."	  	  
50:20	I see.	  	  
50:21	I see.	  	  
50:21	So so you've so like you've got all of your debts.	  	  
50:23	And then below that I want to combine.	  	  
50:26	"If I want to combine it, then I go there."	  	  
50:28	Yeah.	  	  
50:28	I see what you're saying.	  	  
50:29	"OK, got it."	  	  
50:30	Got to go.	  	  
50:30	OK.	  	  
50:31	And then any I'm just looking at my notes.	  	  
50:34	"If I've forgotten some questions here, any further thoughts about the combined statement?"	  	  
50:44	"If you want to tap on the payments in the lower right, you can get back to it and then press the combined statements toward the bottom of that page."	  	  
50:52	"Yeah, there we go."	  	  
50:53	"This is version A, but we'll just ignore that."	  	  
50:56	Yeah.	  	  
50:56	"Any, any further thoughts on this combined statement that you have not yet shared?"	  	  
51:02	"Combined statements, right."	  	  
51:04	"Like I said before, if I want to get the overview of all my bills, then honestly, the combined statement be makes sense and all that."	  	  
51:10	It's all right.	  	  
51:11	I want to pay everything off and all that.	  	  
51:12	"Just give me overbill, you know, just an overview of the whole thing."	  	  
51:16	"Or if I want to print it out, you know, you know, go through some show to my financial advisors, you know, just help me out with my payments."	  	  
51:23	"Yes, that'd be that kind of perfect world that makes sense and all that."	  	  
51:26	"But me in general, I would not use the whole combined PDF statement."	  	  
51:32	I'm type person.	  	  
51:32	I want to attack one bill at a time.	  	  
51:35	"So not just my person, that's just my personal preference."	  	  
51:38	"Yeah, OK, got it."	  	  
51:40	And then any more just wrapping up any further thoughts about specifically managing your finances from the app that you might not have shared before the app?	  	  
51:50	"I mean, like I say, app up."	  	  
51:52	I could just go in here and copay O payments is much easier.	  	  
51:55	The ones I'll talk about on the video.	  	  
51:57	"It just much easier to look at the bill, where it come from everything."	  	  
52:00	"So on the app, it's just makes life easier just to go through the air being tutored because I don't have something If I want something that's overwhelming, that'd be on my laptop."	  	  
52:09	"Well, I got a big screen, I can read stuff, whatever, but that's on my app."	  	  
52:12	"I want everything to be very intuitive, like, hey, I go for tab copay, overpayment, look at the bill, this and that."	  	  
52:17	"Very simple, right?"	  	  
52:18	"Because my phone, you know, so much you do on your phone."	  	  
52:20	So I want my phone to be very intuitive and easy to use and easing on my eyes also.	  	  
52:25	"Oh, easy and nice."	  	  
52:25	Yeah.	  	  
52:26	"OK, got it."	  	  
52:27	Any would there be anything else that could make it even easier on your eyes?	  	  
52:31	"This like this combined statement here, like I said, the PF also, I don't like the the the you know, the zoom in and out because it's a lot of information, right?"	  	  
52:39	"So you look at the PDF, it's just a lot of information."	  	  
52:41	So that's why it's more better on a laptop.	  	  
52:44	"But other than that, you know, just having an individual individual pretty hassle with me and everything I could, I could read things and concentrate on one thing on my mobile."	  	  
52:53	"So that's what I really, really like about it."	  	  
52:56	"OK, got it."	  	  
52:56	"And any final thoughts on really anything else regarding the your management of finances, both the debt and the co-pays together that you had that you haven't shared already?"	  	  
53:07	"I mean, pretty much, I pretty much touched on everything."	  	  
53:09	"You know, I'm just, I'm more individual."	  	  
53:11	I don't pay everything at once.	  	  
53:13	"So that's just always, always been the other things."	  	  
53:15	"So anything, you know, just have options for for individual, I can resolve one bill at a time."	  	  
53:21	"So it just, it just, it just helps out, you know, build confidence, especially reading the whole got it, OK, got it."	  	  
53:27	"All right, I'm going to check in with my colleagues."	  	  
53:29	"If anybody has any other questions you would like to ask, feel free to unmute and ask now."	  	  
53:36	"All right, I'll take that as a note."	  	  
53:45	So that is it for us.	  	  
53:46	"Phil, I really appreciate your time."	  	  
53:48	"This is super helpful to talk directly with veterans about how you're managing things, how you're using our tools so that we can figure out how to make things better."	  	  
54:00	"I do want to check back once again, making sure are you still comfortable if we potentially use a clip from this to show our VA part?"	  	  
54:06	No problem.	  	  
54:07	I have no issues with that.	  	  
54:08	Thank you so much.	  	  
54:10	So that is it for us today.	  	  
54:11	I know Para Jean will be reaching out with a thank you note and that is it for us.
