0:01	Great.	  
0:02	So now that we are recording, are you OK if I record our screen and audio as we talked today?	  
0:08	Yes, ma'am, I'm OK with the record.	  
0:11	Great, thank you.	  
0:12	And would you be OK if I shared any clips from this session with our VA partners?	  
0:19	Yes, ma'am.	  
0:19	Any shared clips will be OK with me.	  
0:21	Great.	  
0:22	Thank you so much.	  
0:24	So first, I'd love to know at whatever level you are comfortable in, know a little bit about yourself as a veteran, maybe what branch you served when you retired or separated.	  
0:35	Yes, ma'am.	  
0:37	So my name is [redacted]	  
0:39	I did seven years active with the [redacted] and then in order to complete my 10 year original contract, I did one year ready reserve and two years in active ready reserve.	  
0:58	So and that was from the years of 1998 to 2007 when I finished my military career and I left as [redacted] was my pay grade.	  
1:13	I was a [redacted] during my entire time in the military and I left with, of course, with some disabilities and things of the sort that I started to receive the disability payments and things of the sort.	  
1:33	So that's been going on ever since I started the VA process, I guess right around about 2014, I think I was kind of kind of behind on joining the VA.	  
1:46	So I, I really didn't know what was available to me.	  
1:49	And, and I guess, you know, through the help of the app, I've been starting to see, you know, so many things that are available and, and, and things like that.	  
1:58	So, you know, the, the, the VA app really helps me to learn about my benefits and keep track of my overpayments that I've made because I can that, that been made to me because I see it in the app.	  
2:13	So that really helps out.	  
2:14	And I guess as far as budgeting to, to pay those debts back, you know, I, I just use regular models.	  
2:23	I just use, you know, the whatever I can find on Google how to budget and things like that.	  
2:30	So, and, and I'm pretty old school.	  
2:33	So, you know, a calculator helps a lot.	  
2:35	You know, I use the calculator, you know, numerous times and also spreadsheets.	  
2:42	I see that kind of helps with Microsoft Excel just to see where, where my funds are going.	  
2:48	Yes, ma'am.	  
2:49	OK, Yeah, great.	  
2:50	Well, you've jumped into my other questions, so excellent getting a head start there.	  
2:55	So I know you say it.	  
2:55	So you, you're using the app now, are you also, are you using the website va.gov or you're just using the app?	  
3:04	Do you know?	  
3:05	I also use the website because I do have a home computer that I use most of the time.	  
3:15	So, so yes, I, I use the website pretty frequently as well.	  
3:19	I, I, I, I do see that by using the website, it kind of expands things a lot better.	  
3:27	You know, I because I can see it on a bigger screen, which is pretty awesome, but the app is you know it, it works.	  
3:33	So like quick things like no one with my appointment is seeing when a VA payment is due to come and seeing when a VA payment, the overpayments, of course, the balances and things like that.	  
3:47	OK, got it.	  
3:48	And so, so you said for, for quick things, quick check, you use the app, any other reason or like timing that you choose to, to be on your phone as opposed to on your computer?	  
4:01	Yes, So being on the computer is mostly like for the weekend, because during, during the work week, you know, I, I have my cell phone with me.	  
4:11	It's pretty handy.	  
4:12	And during like my break times or things like that, I can, I can always check to see when an appointment is coming up or when a prescription has been mailed out, which is really, you know, an awesome part of the app.	  
4:29	You, you know exactly when your, your meds meds have been sent and when to expect those to arrive.	  
4:36	If I need to make an appointment, I, I do find it better to use the app.	  
4:42	It seems like I it's it's just really, really quick to do using the app to make an appointment because I can just check in with my my medical team to let them know what it is I want to be seen for and that that that's real quick and handy by using the app as opposed to waiting on the weekend to use the computer.	  
5:04	OK got it.	  
5:05	OK yeah, that's good to know.	  
5:06	So you can make appointments there quickly.	  
5:09	Got it.	  
5:09	So we're going to move into more into the financial portion of the discussion.	  
5:13	And I do want to make sure that you're only sharing what you are comfortable.	  
5:16	Like I said, I have no, I know nothing about your financial background, so I'd love to know.	  
5:23	I know you've mentioned some overpayments at whatever level you're comfortable.	  
5:28	Just tell me a little bit about that experience.	  
5:31	It could be like how you first learned about the overpayment and did you know it was coming like things like that.	  
5:38	Yes, ma'am.	  
5:39	So the overpayments, I feel comfortable talking about this one because it really had a lot to do with my Montgomery GI Bill.	  
5:48	I believe it was called at one time I paid into the Montgomery GI Bill and I had something that was called a top up for my educational benefits, I think is what what they called it.	  
6:02	But of course, I think something happened with the paperwork or there was a, I have a miscommunication.	  
6:09	They said I used too many benefits.	  
6:11	So it was an overpayment from the Montgomery GI Bill.	  
6:15	So I'm kind of paying some of that back, you know, right now for my educational benefits.	  
6:20	That was the overpayment.	  
6:21	I learned about it through a letter.	  
6:23	A letter came to the household and it was addressed.	  
6:28	It was coming to me from, it was addressed from the, where the educational benefits come from in somewhere.	  
6:38	It was like Montgomery, AL somewhere that was one of those places.	  
6:41	And it was in a Manila envelope.	  
6:43	It was a rather large envelope.	  
6:45	So I knew it had to be official.	  
6:46	And when I opened it, that's when it told me that I had some, some, some over overpayments from the Montgomery GI Bill and the post 911 bill.	  
6:55	So I had to pay, you know, those items back and, and I, I, I kind of, I didn't know it was coming because I, I hadn't spoken to anyone about it.	  
7:08	Just actually the overpayments showed up before the letter showed up.	  
7:13	So I kind of didn't know it was coming up.	  
7:17	So when I saw the overpayments that, you know, it, it, it was kind of like an eye opening experience because, you know, I, I had just automatically felt that whatever the, the Montgomery GI Bill had paid into it would, would cover everything, but, but it didn't.	  
7:36	So OK, so, so it was like, so it was a like a letter.	  
7:41	So you said the, the overpayment came separately from the letter.	  
7:44	When you see overpayment like like almost like a statement or what you owe.	  
7:48	I just want to understand what was, that's what it was a statement of, of what was owed.	  
7:53	And I didn't know what it was for just said over overpayment of benefits.	  
7:58	And then the letter the the more official letter came from.	  
8:01	Oh, OK, got it, got it.	  
8:03	OK, So that sounded like that was confusing, which is understandable.	  
8:06	Any when when you read all this information that you were given, was it clear to you what like what what you had to do or what options you had in order to to address this, this situation?	  
8:22	Yes, it it, it, it was, it was all pretty self it it it explained itself to me in in a way that that if I had a grievance or I wanted to dispute who I should send a dispute to.	  
8:37	It had a a separate letter for that.	  
8:38	So it was really detailed and and I understood it clearly.	  
8:42	Yes, ma'am.	  
8:43	OK, got it.	  
8:43	Great, great.	  
8:45	And then similar question.	  
8:47	What sort of experience have you had with co-pays through VA healthcare at one time?	  
8:55	And, and I when I originally joined the VAIII had several disabilities that I had left the military with and that those 3 disabilities equated to a [redacted] disability.	  
9:16	I think it was [redacted]	  
9:18	And so I had co-pays because I was not in the right group.	  
9:24	There's several different groups you can be into that will explain to you if you have co-pays, if you can use the VA services, they give you something called a means test.	  
9:38	And it was, it was, it was a couple of things that you just have to go through the process and following it all.	  
9:45	I, I, I think they explained, I know they explained it to me rather well.	  
9:50	They did the the the things I had to do in order to know if I would have to do co-pays.	  
9:59	And then Fast forward a couple of years later, I had more disabilities that became approved.	  
10:08	So I moved to a higher percent rate and that moved me into a different tier.	  
10:15	So I had co-pays up into a point and they would send the letter to the house, of course, you know, stating what was old and I could see it in the app.	  
10:29	And those were things that was really essential to me.	  
10:33	No one to stay on top to pay those co-pays back.	  
10:37	My co-pays now are not as high, which is me.	  
10:42	And so looking in the app, it keeps me aware of what what is old.	  
10:50	And, and, and I think, I think the app helps out really great with that too.	  
10:55	OK, got it, got it.	  
10:56	OK, so then, yeah, I want, I want to ask about times that you're, that you're actively managing both these debts and bills.	  
11:05	And when I say manage, this could be, I know you mentioned like you've got spreadsheets, you've got other things that you're looking at calculators.	  
11:13	So, so, so manage could really be anything where you're Yep, dealing with money that is owed when, when are you typically doing that?	  
11:24	And that could be either time of day, time of different days of the month or so or if, if any or at very at like some physical location.	  
11:36	Listen, yeah, like when you're doing this, OK.	  
11:40	So usually the, the time of the month when I start budgeting out the bills is usually at the the first, the very first of the month.	  
11:48	That gives me an idea of, of, of where I am financially in order to have these, these these bills paid for.	  
12:01	Usually at the beginning of the month is the best time for me to be able to, to to budget.	  
12:12	And I usually do that from the comfort of my own home.	  
12:15	My mother downstairs in the dining area is when take care of it usually in the dining area, because in the dining area I can spread all of the bills out on the table and I can see exactly which ones need to come first.	  
12:33	And and that that usually helps, you know, being able to, to visually see those, those bills, you know, know what, what, what what takes priority first.	  
12:44	Yes, ma'am.	  
12:45	OK, got it.	  
12:46	OK, so you said around the 1st of the month.	  
12:48	Any anything else that prompts you or is it really just the calendar like the first?	  
12:53	Yes, ma'am, really the calendar is what prompts me.	  
12:56	Yes, ma'am.	  
12:57	OK, got it.	  
12:58	And the so thinking about both overpayments and co-pays, talk to me about how you think of them both overall within your like overall financial realm.	  
13:12	It's more like do you think of them together?	  
13:14	Do you think of them as different things?	  
13:16	Kind of curious how you how you think about them.	  
13:19	That's that's good.	  
13:20	Yes, ma'am.	  
13:21	I, I, I tend to think of that's money owed to the government.	  
13:24	So I think of it as just one, one item.	  
13:27	Yes, ma'am.	  
13:28	OK.	  
13:29	And so it sounds like you are making payments at the same time.	  
13:32	Would that be you are OK, good.	  
13:34	Got it.	  
13:36	And then any I know you said you've got your your spreadsheets.	  
13:40	Any other ways that you are keeping track of money that you owe the government?	  
13:46	No, I just keep I just keep keep my eyes on on the app.	  
13:51	That's that's the other the the app like the va.gov on computer and in the app.	  
13:58	Yes, ma'am.	  
13:59	OK, so, and then so you said when you're when you're keeping an eye on, is that just at the 1st of the month?	  
14:04	Or is that any other times that you're keeping an eye on things?	  
14:08	So, so, so one thing I like about the, the way the app is set up it, it kind of takes you to your, your homepage, my VAI think it's called my VA and it shows your service connections.	  
14:22	It shows if you have any, any, any open claims or, or things like that.	  
14:31	And then it shows, you know, your appointments that are coming up and then it shows co-pays and things like that.	  
14:38	Everything is just all in one area.	  
14:40	So usually when I'm going to the app to check on a claim or check on appointment, I can usually just thumb down and you know, so, so periodically throughout the month, I see it, you know, if, if there's any changes or things like that.	  
14:57	And I can see all of that in the app.	  
15:00	OK, so you said, you said periodically throughout the month.	  
15:02	Is there anything that prompts you to check?	  
15:07	Usually if I get a get one of those, those bills in the mail, because I will say that about the VA, they're they're still still sending out the letters and, and, and, and I like that, you know, that they still send the letters out because if I go to the mailbox and and it says, you know, here's a co-pay from, from this prescription that you had or something like that, it kind of lets me know, OK, let's go to the app and check on that just to just double check.	  
15:35	Yes, ma'am.	  
15:36	OK, got it.	  
15:38	And is there anything that you experience experience as challenging or confusing with keeping track of both overpayments and co-pay bills?	  
15:50	I don't find too much of it as overwhelming as I did when I first started receiving those waters and knowing that I had co-pays because now it's almost, you know, like second nature.	  
16:06	I know, I know I get a prescription, there's going to be a co-pay that's going to come along with it.	  
16:11	And I do like the like, like, like one thing that that I think could be done in order to, to to maybe help the veterans.	  
16:22	Maybe, you know, I think like how civilian doctors have like a generic sheet.	  
16:27	And I think maybe most of the drugs at the VA are generic.	  
16:30	But I think if there was something like maybe a lower cost similar drug or something like that, that will probably help veterans out to know about some co-pays wouldn't be as high.	  
16:42	That would be really helpful.	  
16:44	Oh, OK.	  
16:45	So, so just have having ideas of of how you can lower the cost of anything.	  
16:49	Yes, ma'am.	  
16:51	OK, got it.	  
16:51	Got it.	  
16:53	OK, so we're now going to move into looking at a prototype and I'd love to have you share your screen.	  
17:01	Have you done that before here on Zoom share screen?	  
17:10	I'm happy to walk you through in case it's a little confusing.	  
17:14	Here it is.	  
17:15	I see.	  
17:15	Share.	  
17:16	OK, great.	  
17:17	Microsoft OneDrive.	  
17:19	I guess that's it.	  
17:21	No, you would just want to share.	  
17:22	It should be share and then like your entire screen or screen, you might have to Scroll down to see some options.	  
17:33	Oh wow, this is new.	  
17:43	Share.	  
17:44	Share entire screen.	  
17:45	Yeah, yeah, yeah.	  
17:48	How's that?	  
17:49	OK, yes, perfect.	  
17:51	OK, so then I am going to send.	  
17:57	Oops.	  
17:58	Just copying a link to send you.	  
18:02	Give me just a moment.	  
18:04	Yes, ma'am.	  
18:05	And let's see, we'll see if this this should open up the Figma app and then I'm going to have you login and I'm going to give you something to login.	  
18:16	So you should see.	  
18:19	Yeah, there we go, Emily to meeting group chat.	  
18:21	So go ahead and tap on that and let's just see what happens.	  
18:25	With any luck, the Figma app will open.	  
18:28	If not, we will get there somehow.	  
18:39	Try tapping it again.	  
18:40	It didn't.	  
18:40	It didn't seem to respond to you for some reason.	  
18:45	Yes, ma'am.	  
18:46	Could you send it one more time?	  
18:47	Because I try.	  
18:48	I try tapping once in the middle of the screen, and we should be able to see the chat.	  
18:53	Oh.	  
18:54	So on the far left, lower left, I can see a tiny little one.	  
18:59	I see it there.	  
19:00	Yeah.	  
19:00	Sometimes it gets here.	  
19:01	Yeah.	  
19:01	Here we go.	  
19:02	Got it.	  
19:03	Oh, yeah.	  
19:03	So tap on that very long link.	  
19:07	OK.	  
19:07	It's doing something and I think here we go.	  
19:13	It's coming.	  
19:13	It's slowly coming back.	  
19:15	And hold with two fingers.	  
19:19	Yeah, you can, you can ignore that.	  
19:21	And it just, it takes a moment to load up.	  
19:26	All right.	  
19:27	And it it looks like you had signed in on Figma already.	  
19:31	It's it's my guess because it's not, it's not, it's not asking for a sign in.	  
19:35	So that's fine.	  
19:36	All right, we'll just wait a moment here.	  
19:41	There we go.	  
19:42	I love when things just work.	  
19:44	Makes my makes my life easier.	  
19:46	OK, so I'm not going to have you tap on anything quite yet.	  
19:49	OK.	  
19:51	So in this example, we're going to pretend that you have some overpayment debt from some disability education benefits.	  
20:02	Along with some medical co-pay was from some routine doctor visits and prescriptions.	  
20:10	So again, before we tap on anything, this this is really is this is just kind of a, a a mixture of what a couple of the designs actually look at.	  
20:19	So like this wouldn't actually be what you are really looking at, but when, what might be a time that you would look at let's say just your co-pay bills or just your overpayments as opposed to when you might want to see everything together, Steve, I see.	  
20:40	I would say maybe maybe once a week, maybe like on Friday, like on a payday.	  
20:48	Absolutely on a payday.	  
20:49	OK to see sorry.	  
20:51	So would that be to see everything together or to look at each one individually?	  
20:55	Just to look at each one individually, OK and any money you said like on on a Friday any that that was payday other any other reasons you might want to look into individual copay bills or individual overpayments?	  
21:12	Yes, when when whenever I received the letter in the mail that that prompt me to yes ma'am.	  
21:18	OK, got it.	  
21:21	And then before I'm going to in just a moment, I'm going to have you tap into combined statement.	  
21:25	But before you do, what do you expect to find under the combined statement, combined statements?	  
21:34	Oh, maybe that's going to be everything together like a total bill perhaps or OK, got it.	  
21:42	And any end, I'll have you tap in just a moment, but thoughts on how helpful that might or might not be?	  
21:50	You said you'd mentioned like seeing a total bill.	  
21:53	Yeah, I think that would be helpful.	  
21:56	Yeah.	  
21:57	Because then it would, it would be like it would just be the total bill that I actually owe that that would be kind of helpful.	  
22:05	OK, got it.	  
22:06	All right.	  
22:07	So go ahead and tap where it says combined statement.	  
22:10	OK.	  
22:12	OK.	  
22:13	So this is a representation of of of an actual combined, I mean actual meaning with fake data, of course, everywhere but scroll around or scroll up and down rather and share your thoughts on how this compares to what you were expecting and maybe what might, what you would consider helpful.	  
22:40	Oh, OK.	  
22:40	So this is more more more like each individual payment and what it was for is what it looks like.	  
22:50	I think that that that is really helpful.	  
22:52	It shows what the previous balance, the description of the drug that you're paying the co-pay for the outpatient care.	  
23:00	So even even even even if you had to try to remember what the bill was for this, this would kind of remind you of each, each bill and, and, and the total of them together.	  
23:19	So I find this very helpful.	  
23:21	OK, very helpful.	  
23:25	And when I made my payments balance decrease, it shows when I paid or, or had payments or when the balance decreased and when it increased.	  
23:38	So it's almost like a one stop shop and the post the overpayment for education benefits.	  
23:47	Yes, ma'am.	  
23:49	So it's it's it's it's self-explanatory.	  
23:52	I I think it it would really help help out with this type of button.	  
23:58	Yes, ma'am.	  
23:59	OK, great.	  
24:01	Is there any other information maybe that you're not seeing that wouldn't make it even more useful?	  
24:13	I know a lot of with with most of my bills for other places it shows where the where the payments are coming from.	  
24:22	Like it may show my half of my bank account number or it may show the last four digits of my credit card.	  
24:31	So, so I know which, which account I'm paying these these bills with that that would probably be a little helpful if if I had that.	  
24:44	OK, makes sense.	  
24:46	Anything else that you think would anything additional that you think would make it even more useful?	  
24:53	No, ma'am.	  
24:55	OK.	  
24:56	And then in, in what situations do you think you would use something like this, this combined statement?	  
25:04	Oh, the first of the month knowing we're going to budget everything.	  
25:10	OK.	  
25:11	And would this be something I know you said you will occasionally look at at the website or app at other times.	  
25:18	Would you use this at other times beyond the 1st of the month, do you think?	  
25:23	Oh, yes, I would, I would use it maybe, maybe, maybe now I would use it more often just to just to see what my balance decreases are, you know, because that's real helpful.	  
25:39	OK, so since you mentioned the balance decrease in the in this example here we have balance, we have transactions going back.	  
25:49	Oh, I think about a year or so.	  
25:51	Thoughts on like how far back you might want to see transactions?	  
25:58	A year, a year, definitely a year.	  
26:01	Yeah.	  
26:01	OK, got it.	  
26:04	And then on a scale of one to five, how overwhelming or not does this feel to you one being and not at all 5 being completely overwhelming.	  
26:18	OK, I would say it's it's not overwhelming at all.	  
26:21	I would say it's a one.	  
26:23	OK, got it.	  
26:25	And then are there any actions or decisions you would want to make specifically when viewing this?	  
26:34	I do like that they have an option to review and resolve.	  
26:47	So if I ever wanted to make the action to pay it all off, I could.	  
26:52	If it was a small bill, I could just review and resolve, you know, the bill I want to pay off.	  
26:59	And then there's a phone number I can call to discuss the payment options.	  
27:04	I think that's that's a good feature.	  
27:07	OK, so you'd want to be able to resolve from here.	  
27:08	Got it.	  
27:10	And how about anything you might want to do looking at this page that might be different from viewing the individual statements?	  
27:21	I think this lays it out pretty rather well.	  
27:25	Yes, ma'am.	  
27:26	I I don't think there's any.	  
27:27	Yeah, it's it's a real it's a great tool to be able to see everything all at once and just and just not from that first one.	  
27:38	It just showed just the number told.	  
27:41	This one is an actual.	  
27:43	It shows you each payment where it could it could possibly go into.	  
27:47	OK, got it.	  
27:51	And how might you prefer to interact with this information?	  
27:54	I know you said often at the 1st of the month you like to be at your, I think you said a dining room table, you're at your computer, everything laid out.	  
28:03	Yeah, Yeah.	  
28:05	I'd be curious like seeing this combined statement, how you would want to be viewing all this information that could be on your computer, on your phone, physical copy of something APDF, things like that.	  
28:17	Yes, yes.	  
28:18	So, so usually in in with, with this amount of information, it's, it's, it's great to have it, you know, on the phone, like when I'm trying to reference it, but at the beginning of the month, I would, I would like to have it printed out or, or perhaps maybe on a larger screen so I could, you know, be able to not make any mistakes.	  
28:47	OK, so you would, you would print that and and do do you often print things out from the website?	  
28:54	I do because I'm, I do have access to a printer in the household.	  
28:59	I like to print things out and, and, and be able to physically, you know, see it if I need to keep it for my records because I know sometimes things on the computer may, you know, if the computer's down or the cell phones down, I don't have quick enough access to it.	  
29:19	I like to have it printed out.	  
29:23	OK, got it.	  
29:24	And maybe you scroll to the top of this page here.	  
29:29	OK, All right.	  
29:34	So I'm not going to have you tap on yet, but the blue download combined statement, what do you assume that is?	  
29:43	So that's going to put it in a, as you mentioned, maybe APDF file or, or, or something that I would be able to print either at this time or later time because it'll say to my and I could save it as a file to my phone or my computer or as as everyone does now to be in in some type of Microsoft cloud or something of another.	  
30:09	OK, got it.	  
30:09	And currently do you look or somehow interact with PDFs on your phone at all?	  
30:17	Yes, ma'am.	  
30:19	Usually if I have like tickets or something like that, it usually goes to APDF file.	  
30:24	OK, excuse me.	  
30:27	And then you mentioned possibly saving things, the saving PDFs on your phone as well.	  
30:32	Yes, ma'am.	  
30:33	OK, got it.	  
30:34	And is that mostly to the to the cloud somewhere?	  
30:38	Do you have anything on your phone itself where you're saving it?	  
30:42	I have, I have a downloaded file tab on my in, in, in my apps.	  
30:49	Yes, ma'am.	  
30:50	Got it.	  
30:50	Got it.	  
30:50	OK, Let me have you tap on that Combined.	  
30:52	Sorry.	  
30:53	Combined download, combined statement.	  
30:58	OK.	  
30:58	All right.	  
30:59	Oh, yeah.	  
31:00	Yes.	  
31:01	Yes, ma'am.	  
31:02	Yeah.	  
31:02	Yeah.	  
31:02	Thoughts on what this looks like compared to what you were assuming it might be?	  
31:12	This looks like something that they would send me in the mail is what it looks like.	  
31:16	Yes, ma'am.	  
31:18	And would.	  
31:19	Yeah.	  
31:19	Go ahead.	  
31:21	I, I, I would definitely hang on to this because it has the department, the United States Veterans Department Insignia at the top and the, the file number.	  
31:30	So it, it, it, it would definitely be something I would keep from my own records if I printed it.	  
31:35	OK.	  
31:36	And, and would you, would you print it from your phone?	  
31:38	You think?	  
31:39	I, I could, I, I have a, a option with the printer that I have.	  
31:44	It's a Wi-Fi printer, so I could, if I really wanted to.	  
31:48	Yes, ma'am.	  
31:49	OK, got it.	  
31:50	And what do you think you might do?	  
31:53	You said printing.	  
31:54	Would you think you would do anything else with this PDF from your phone?	  
31:59	I could also send it if if there was some financial assistance needed and they needed a copy to see what my bills were, how much in debt, there was some help.	  
32:11	I could always save it and send it to that industry or that that department that's providing assistance.	  
32:21	Yes, ma'am.	  
32:22	OK, got it.	  
32:24	And would there talk to me about how you might use this PDF versus the page We just looked at the the full combined statement that you were scrolling through 1 you might use one versus the other.	  
32:38	I would use that one we just visited for my own viewing and then I would use this one to to have for, for for when I'm budgeting out things or or looking for that assistance.	  
32:58	Yes, ma'am.	  
32:59	OK, got it.	  
33:02	And let me have you tap on the top you can where it says done there, OK.	  
33:09	And then tap where it says home on the bottom, OK.	  
33:15	And let me have you tap into overpayments.	  
33:20	Just going to have a quick look into these.	  
33:23	Sorry.	  
33:24	So this is OK.	  
33:26	I'm pretending this is all the same information as what you would seen on the combined statement.	  
33:31	But looking at that first one, the disability compensation and pension debt go the part of these don't work.	  
33:39	But thoughts on you can go into the details, but thoughts on the information provided on this overpayment section compared to the information you saw on the combined statement?	  
33:54	OK, this one, this one is more what you have left your current balance, what's to pay.	  
34:03	So if you wanted to resolve an overpayment, I'm, I'm guessing maybe this is, this is the resolve at all at one time or it may be able to let you break it down into like a certain payment.	  
34:17	It just says current balance and then it says resolve the overpayment.	  
34:22	So hopefully by pressing that button, I would think that it's now going to take me to another page where I can say how much I want to pay on it.	  
34:34	I, I think is what I'm thinking or, or it it could be I'm resolving the total current balance.	  
34:44	So it could probably be one of two things is what I'm thinking.	  
34:49	OK, let me go and tap into the review details for that first, just to see the information here and Scroll down and have a look around and just looking at the information provided here again, how, how, how it might be, how you might use this versus the combined statement we looked at earlier.	  
35:12	OK, so this is, this is definitely for use when I'm getting ready to make that payment.	  
35:18	I'm I'm pay the bill, pay the bill off maybe as opposed to that statement, I'm just looking at what I need the budget to pay.	  
35:30	OK, so, so this one more when you're looking to pay and the other one for like get to understand everything want to make sure.	  
35:39	OK, got it.	  
35:42	So do you think with the the other combined statement, do you think you would use that at all when you are looking to pay?	  
35:56	I, I, I could, I could only, I would only say this one gives me that option to pay everything off.	  
36:09	And I do remember that, that, that the, the statement had the number to call.	  
36:16	I think it was the number to call to speak to someone.	  
36:18	So no, if I wanted to physically speak to someone, I would use the other one.	  
36:25	But if I'm just making a payment all all all on my own, I would use this one.	  
36:32	OK, got it.	  
36:33	And thoughts on if one might be more useful than the other at any time?	  
36:39	The combined statement versus this individual overpayment information?	  
36:45	I think the combined statement is more useful to know where I'm making a payment to which, which of the the different Co payments and things like that that I'm making a payment to as opposed to this one.	  
37:00	Looks like I'm just paying a full debt off.	  
37:04	OK, got it, got it.	  
37:06	And then is there any other, and I've already mentioned a lot, but if is there any other information that might be important to you when considering your entire financial situation?	  
37:23	I would say this debt management center phone number that that's pretty helpful.	  
37:29	And there's a, there's the phone number to call Speaking of days and the time.	  
37:33	So having that available, that debt management phone number really helps.	  
37:38	I think of, you know, someone like me out is trying to make sure that I'm making the payments on time or if I needed to reach out to ask for an extension or something like that, they could maybe direct me to who to speak to or tell me what type of other options I may have.	  
38:01	Yes, ma'am.	  
38:02	OK, so so information on just how to get in touch with someone as long as useful.	  
38:06	Got it.	  
38:06	OK, got it.	  
38:08	And then tell me about any thoughts you have on the trust you have for viewing the information, both the individual and then on the combined statements, like how, yeah, how much you're trusting what you're seeing.	  
38:27	I think that lays it all out.	  
38:31	If I have a discrepancy or something that, you know, maybe I didn't attend that if I, if I see something that I did not attend or some type of prescription that I didn't get, that would probably be the time for me to call and speak to someone and say, you know, maybe that that payment isn't, isn't accurate because I didn't receive that medication or that's not my medication.	  
38:55	So I think it really helps seeing it spread out like that.	  
39:02	It it really shows you that combined statement tells you exactly what why you're being charged that amount of money.	  
39:12	OK, all right, got it.	  
39:16	All right, So let me go, let me have you tap on home again.	  
39:21	We're going to jump to the the future versions here.	  
39:27	So so we're going to look at some designs for the mobile app that don't currently exist.	  
39:33	So let me have you we'll start with version A on the left there.	  
39:40	So this is like I said, this is not currently in the app, but let me have you scroll around and look at things to get a sense of of what is here and any thoughts you have along the way.	  
39:54	I'll certainly ask some follow up questions.	  
40:01	This is it's kind of like the combined statement and showing the balances.	  
40:10	OK, OK, OK.	  
40:16	I think it's a good layout.	  
40:18	And I like that you can view your combined statement.	  
40:21	The PDF button is right at the top if you want to see everything made out.	  
40:25	So I think it's rather useful.	  
40:30	OK, OK.	  
40:33	And then so knowing that you have both both co-pays and overpayments in this situation here.	  
40:41	Yeah, talk to me about looking at at both of those and just how how that experience would be.	  
40:48	OK, so I can press the co-pay bill tab to see co-pays and then press the overpayment tabs to see overpayments.	  
40:57	So even though it's on the same same site, I guess same site, I got two options to go to see both of my co-pays and my overpayments.	  
41:12	So it, it, it's, it's handy and, and once again, I had the combined statement that I can, I can print out OK and do that.	  
41:24	So I know you mentioned the, the combined PDF statement you would, you would print out looking at, at how the information is displayed here.	  
41:34	Do you think you would view that PDF on the phone or, or would that just be for printing?	  
41:39	Do you think I would view it on the phone?	  
41:45	Yeah, I could definitely view it on the phone as well before I print it.	  
41:49	OK and talk to me about why you might choose to view the PDF as opposed to the information on the co-pays tabs and the overpayments tab.	  
42:02	I'd like I like the the the the PDF statement because it puts everything all together.	  
42:07	I think things all together.	  
42:10	OK, all right.	  
42:11	So it's so it sounds like you would you would prefer to have everything on one-on-one page then?	  
42:18	Yes ma'am.	  
42:19	Got it.	  
42:20	OK.	  
42:22	And so looking at the the two different tabs, the co-pays and overpayments, any are there any details missing that would be important to you for managing finances?	  
42:34	You saw Bill tells me what my total due is, what my payments are.	  
42:43	Everything's pretty much laid out.	  
42:45	Yes, ma'am.	  
42:45	There's that phone number at the bottom.	  
42:47	So I think everything's pretty, pretty spread out on this page.	  
42:52	Yes, ma'am.	  
42:54	OK.	  
42:55	And if this were built in the app just like it is, talk to me about how likely you think you it would be that that that you would use this this design right here.	  
43:08	This design.	  
43:15	I would, I would probably use it if not as frequent as the other one.	  
43:22	And only reason why I say that is just because I would, I would more or less likely print my statement and I would have that at my disposal.	  
43:33	So I, I really wouldn't come back to this page because I have to go to two different tabs.	  
43:39	So I wouldn't use this one that that much.	  
43:42	OK, got it.	  
43:45	And let me have you Scroll down to the bottom.	  
43:50	Just going to have you get to the other version.	  
43:52	Yeah, go back where it says combined statement B OK, see what we have here?	  
43:58	Yeah.	  
43:58	So, yeah, look around, see what differences you notice and and again, like which one might be more useful to you.	  
44:08	If you want to switch back and forth between A&B, that's fine.	  
44:12	Yeah.	  
44:13	This is just like before, it just shows the total amount that's due and not like a breakdown to which ones they were upfront, not unless these little arrow things take you somewhere.	  
44:26	But yeah, payments made-up the one.	  
44:28	OK, so, so you have to use the arrows to kind of open it up as opposed to that first page.	  
44:33	It pretty much showed everything right there as soon as you open it.	  
44:39	So I would, I would prefer A / B because at least a kind of tells me immediately what that bill is for.	  
44:48	So I'm not really blind sided.	  
44:50	I have a $75.00 bill, but I just don't know what it's for here.	  
44:55	I actually hit the arrows.	  
44:57	Not, not that it, it really would be hard to do, but I, I just think that maybe for anyone that's just trying to find out what they have to pay at once, they're trying to do it quick because it's on the phone.	  
45:11	I think it's best to have it all laid out like in in the model A because it shows me exactly what's due and and and who's getting paid.	  
45:23	Oh, OK, so so you, you, you would want to have those, those, those things expanded with the errors, right.	  
45:29	OK, got it.	  
45:30	How about any information the differences between A&B of on the the rest of the pages or sorry, the rest of the page looks like they all pretty much have notice of rights and responsibilities, which clinics you went to and which medications you had to use.	  
45:53	So I think, I think all the information is the same on looks like it's the same on both, but it's just not expanded.	  
46:00	OK, maybe go back to my statement a there.	  
46:04	OK, Yeah.	  
46:08	So it's not.	  
46:09	I see.	  
46:10	And I'm so sorry.	  
46:11	This one does tell you why you're receiving a bill for.	  
46:15	I do notice that as opposed to B doesn't tell you, you know, some folks do.	  
46:21	Yeah.	  
46:22	B doesn't tell you why you're receiving it.	  
46:25	I do notice that difference because this is B.	  
46:29	And then on A it it tells you you're receiving this billing statement because you're currently enrolled in a priority group.	  
46:35	Exactly.	  
46:36	So, OK, thoughts on how how useful that information either just like you read, you read yes, that's that's very useful because it gives the gives the veteran at least the idea, you know, to inform the veteran.	  
46:53	You know, This is why you're receiving this this bill.	  
46:56	So so that helps for treatment of non service connected conditions.	  
47:00	Yes, ma'am.	  
47:01	Got it.	  
47:01	OK, All right.	  
47:02	So sounds like you would you would want that you would want the the menu with the arrows.	  
47:08	You want want those expanded.	  
47:13	And then it also sounds like you would want everything in one screen as opposed to like the co-pays and overpays as opposed to tabs.	  
47:22	Is that right?	  
47:22	Yep, that's right.	  
47:24	And then any, you know, imagining you have full control over what you're seeing.	  
47:29	Are there other things that you would want added or moved changed that would make it easiest for you to look at?	  
47:36	Everything I think, I think everything is right where it needs to be at.	  
47:42	Yes ma'am.	  
47:44	OK, and then let me have you go.	  
47:48	Let me see.	  
47:51	I forget if this is hooked up, but go ahead and try tapping the payments on the very, very top left.	  
47:55	Actually forget this is hooked up or not.	  
47:57	Let's find out.	  
47:59	Yep, it is OK.	  
48:01	And then tap on where it says co-pay bills.	  
48:05	This is hooked up.	  
48:07	Yes, ma'am.	  
48:07	All right, great.	  
48:09	See and you can go into the details of this and just I wanted to get any, any final thoughts on looking at an individual co-pay bill versus the combined statement and any any further thoughts on when you might we use one or the other?	  
48:29	So I would use this one maybe, maybe, maybe I didn't remember which which clinic I might have went to or which prescription I got if I wasn't looking at the, the combined statement.	  
48:47	So I would use this just to kind of jolt my memory, I guess.	  
48:53	And I like how it has all the, the, the PDF statements.	  
48:57	You could open them up for the for the past six months, the charges and download your mail statements from the past six months.	  
49:05	And I think that's a great feature to have because a lot I, I, I just like having it on being able to see the PDF if I needed to, to download or print it just to keep for my records.	  
49:16	OK, got it.	  
49:21	And then, OK, so you'd want to look here for possible downloading things for your records.	  
49:28	Any other thoughts about when, like when you might use the individual co-pay statement here or co-pay information or I want you to tap into the overpayments just to look at that one as well.	  
49:41	Yeah.	  
49:42	And again, you can go into the review details.	  
49:45	Yeah, I'd love to know any further thoughts on when you think you might use this area versus a combined statement seeing everything at once.	  
49:55	You know, likewise I if, if I needed to, to kind of refresh my memory about what, what, what the balance is, what is it for this one says post 911 for tuition payment.	  
50:10	And then then if I had a disability compensation payment, which, which ones of those are the, the, the, the, the breakdown of that full payment that that I have due for, for, for the overpayments of of benefits.	  
50:28	Yes, ma'am.	  
50:29	OK, So more, more detail on this one.	  
50:33	OK, got it.	  
50:35	And are there any other thoughts about or I shouldn't back up?	  
50:41	So going back to a conversation we had earlier about like when you're doing any sort of management of finances and you said on your phone, it's more like quick checking, referencing.	  
50:53	Any other thoughts on when or yeah, really, really when you might use the phone, especially in regards to having a combined statement.	  
51:04	Maybe maybe maybe like if I get that letter in the mail that you know, that they usually send out, I can I can use it for like a quick reference I think.	  
51:20	OK.	  
51:21	And then yeah.	  
51:23	Anything else regarding management of VA debts and bills overall?	  
51:28	Doesn't have to be just the phone that you haven't yet shared that you would like to No, not about that like that.	  
51:37	Just just the just the, the, the, the, the payments of it.	  
51:42	You know, using my dining room table to spread the thing out that I printed out or, or using my computer, you know, spreadsheet that I have.	  
51:51	Yes, ma'am.	  
51:52	OK, got it.	  
51:54	And I'm just going to check in with the team.	  
51:57	Natasha, if you have anything you would like to ask, feel free to unmute and ask.	  
52:08	I am curious with the view of the combined statement that had everything expanded that you saw first, do you feel like you trust that information more than the individual statements or do you trusted about the same?	  
52:26	That's a good one.	  
52:27	I, I, I would, I would, I would probably trust the, the, the well, I would trust the, the overview statement, which was the combined statement just just for the fact that everything is is laid out all together or because everything is at one place to see it.	  
52:51	I would trust that when now the individuals, it's just just like what I was had mentioned, like if I have a discrepancy or I have to refresh my memory to think about if I had that drug or if I showed up to that appointment that they're saying I have on record, I would really, really want to look into it.	  
53:13	So I do trust the the overall combined statement.	  
53:18	But then once again, you know, I guess it's like 5050 because if I see it broken down to each individual payment and what it's for, I can always look into it to see if it's something that I did and I hadn't remembered it or, or I could look into everything else that I've already printed out to see if it was a drug, a drug that I got or was prescribed to me.	  
53:46	So, so it's almost like pretty much basically the same.	  
53:50	I guess I would look at them both the same because if I had any discrepancies or something on my end that I wanted to question, I could always reach out to someone.	  
53:59	It's just good to see it laid out all together.	  
54:05	Thank you.	  
54:06	OK, And then if you're pretending you're you're like you're opening up your app like this.	  
54:15	Thoughts on if you would first go to a combined statement or go to the specific co-pay bill or overpayments first?	  
54:25	I want to go to that combined statement first.	  
54:29	Got it.	  
54:29	OK, Yeah, great.	  
54:31	OK.	  
54:32	I believe those are all the questions.	  
54:35	So thank you so much for talking with us today.	  
54:39	It's very helpful for us to talk to veterans about their experiences here.	  
54:44	So we are working on making everything better as you know as as much as possible with within the app.	  
54:51	So appreciate you taking the time.	  
54:54	I just want to check again and make sure you are still comfortable if we decide to use any clips from this session with our partners.	  
55:02	Yes, I am comfortable if if any clips have to be used from this session.	  
55:06	Great, thanks so much.	  
55:07	Well, that's all for today.	  
55:08	So again, I appreciate you taking the time and I know Para Jean is going to be reaching out to you with a thank you note and thank you for your time and hope you have a great rest of your day.	  
55:20	I hope you all do the same.	  
55:22	Thank you so much.	  
55:23	All right, take care.	  
55:24	OK, goodbye.
