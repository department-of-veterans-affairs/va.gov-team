## **Transcript: P11**

0:02	"OK, so we are recording."  
0:04	Are you OK if I record my audio and visual today?  
0:08	"Yes, Great."  
0:09	And are you OK if we potentially use any clips to show our VA partners?  
0:14	"Yes, Great."  
0:15	Thank you.  
0:16	"OK, so first at whatever level you're comfortable, I'd love to know a bit about you as a veteran."  
0:23	Could be the branch you served and when you were tired or separated.  
0:27	"Yeah, I was."  
0:29	"So I served \[redacted\] from 2004 till 2014, \[redacted\]."  
0:41	And so I just separated normal.  
0:45	"So just a normal or just a just a veteran, not a not a retiree or anything like that."  
0:50	"No, no medical retiring or anything."  
0:52	"So just yeah, I did did my nine years with the \[redacted\] and and then got out."  
0:58	"OK, great."  
0:59	And then what sort of interactions have you had with Veteran Affairs since then?  
1:04	It is very limited for the first.  
1:09	Let's see.  
1:11	"It was it was well, basically until this year, essentially like I, I would have signed up with that."  
1:17	"I would have like started interacting with Veteran Affairs like after the PACT Act was passed and I realized that I like had access to some things I didn't know about really, or I was just, I, I probably should have known about it, but I didn't."  
1:31	"So I, I would have signed up in 2023-2024 for just the standard VA healthcare."  
1:37	"And then I, I did, I would have done my first claim this year from March and then it was completed in July."  
1:45	"So from basically, I had like no interaction until this year around March, April, when I started like actually using VA healthcare for just standard stuff."  
1:57	So I've actually interacted with them a decent amount this year.  
2:02	"But prior to this year, you know, next to nothing really."  
2:07	"OK, good."  
2:08	"And you said, oh, I want to make sure I didn't miss here."  
2:11	Were you not aware of what you were entitled to?  
2:15	Yeah.  
2:15	"I mean, yeah, no fault of anybody."  
2:18	"But I, I believe when the PAC tax stuff, I, I started getting emails about like, hey, like you're, you know, due to PAC tax burn pit registration was, so I did the burn pit registration and then I, and then I just found out like, oh, no, like, you know, if you, you can enroll and you're automatically will qualify for, you know, for VA healthcare, there were, there are levels to it or whatever."  
2:40	"But so, yeah, I, I went ahead and did that."  
2:43	And then this year I actually started utilizing like the VA healthcare like services.  
2:50	"Oh, got it."  
2:50	"OK, great."  
2:52	"And then so it it, it was through those, those notifications about the pack tech that, that that was when he first heard."  
2:57	"OK, got it."  
2:58	"And then how about any, any experience you've had with the VA website and or the mobile app?"  
3:06	I used both.  
3:08	"Well, again, mainly it would have been, you know, this year, but yeah, I've used both for what the app and the the website both for different, well, some, some some of the reasons and some different."  
3:25	"But I think I think the website obviously will probably have more, more information in there."  
3:30	"But I do, I have the app and I regularly use the app, you know, on on a monthly basis at least."  
3:36	"And then the website, you know, because it has everything in there from, you know, education, medical and and compensation and stuff like that."  
3:46	So yeah.  
3:46	"OK, So what, what specific things are you going to the app for?"  
3:54	So the app would mainly be anymore it would just be I'm trying to remember if there is it.  
4:03	"So mainly it's just to check on the compensation and benefits like whenever they're due or yeah, whenever they're getting close to being due."  
4:13	"Trying to think what else I go into the app for if I need to get a letter, if there's something that I'm, I'm submitting for or whatever, and I need a, a verification letter or whatever, I will go to the app because it's pretty quick to go in there."  
4:24	"You can just go, it's on the bottom tab, like I think it's under benefits and you can, you can click on the various level letters and like customize it to whatever you need."  
4:33	"So I, I do go there because it's a lot."  
4:35	It's quicker for me just to do that and then e-mail it to myself and print it out.  
4:42	"So, but yeah, really, really the app would be more on the compensation stuff, just getting, you know, information on on like on on that when it's processing and stuff."  
4:53	And then if I do need a letter and the website is more other stuff.  
4:59	OK.  
4:59	"Yeah, got it."  
5:01	OK.  
5:01	"So we're going to move into the financial portion of the discussion and I want to make sure you're only sharing what you are comfortable, what you're willing."  
5:09	"Like I said, I don't have any access to any of your records in any way."  
5:14	"So just looking at the the the Screener question that that Perigita had sent out, I saw that you had checked that you either currently or previously had had an unpaid VA benefits overpayment debt and let them know just at whatever level you're comfortable a little bit about that experience."  
5:34	"Yeah, so I believe I got it in the so I got a notice in the mail and it's still showing on VA."  
5:41	"But yeah, there there would be they're they're they're claiming it's a debt that I owe, but I, I don't quite understand it."  
5:48	That could be a separate topic.  
5:50	I know.  
5:50	"But yes, I, I, I got the letter, I got the letter in the mail."  
5:52	And then I also have a notice on the on the VA website.  
5:55	"It's like still showing from September of, of unpaid, unpaid debt."  
6:01	Really.  
6:03	"OK, got it."  
6:04	"And so it's, it's, it's not clear to you like what it, what it's from."  
6:09	"Well, it says it's the Co payment that, that is due to \[redacted\] or I think it's like the, the one that I've been to here, or maybe they just administer everything for this area."  
6:20	"But it, it just doesn't make any sense to me because I did pay."  
6:24	"I, I went and and then paid it on the treasury because I got it."  
6:27	"I'm like, oh man."  
6:28	"Because I was worried that like this was going to affect like, you know, anything."  
6:31	"What you don't want to like what you don't want to owe them money, I guess."  
6:35	"And so I wouldn't pay it and it just, it won't, it's not, it's not coming off."  
6:39	And so I don't know what's going on.  
6:40	"I haven't contacted them, but but yeah, I know."  
6:44	"I, I did get the letter and then I got another thing."  
6:46	That one disappeared though.  
6:48	"But I did have another one, a Co payment as well over the summer that I that I, that I took care of."  
6:56	And that one did go away on the website.  
6:59	"But yeah, OK, got it."  
7:02	So then are there other types of money that that the VA has told you that you owe outside of Co payments?  
7:12	"No, got it."  
7:14	OK.  
7:15	"And so so with the with these co-pays, you said you got got a letter in the mail and then when you log into your account, you're seeing it there."  
7:24	"How was the clarity in terms of what, any next steps or what options you, you might have had in terms of dealing with this?"  
7:35	I thought it was clear when I went on the website.  
7:37	"And then because I think even the letter, I'd have to see, I'd have to go through my, my paperwork and, and like, look at the letter again."  
7:43	"But like you go to the treasury, like I think you go to treasury.gov or it, it's, it's another, it, it's not the VA where you, where I go and pay it."  
7:51	"I was under the, I was under the understanding that you just go there and then you enter there."  
7:58	"There's something about a code, you it, you would enter your information and you would pay it."  
8:03	But I did that.  
8:04	"And then unfortunately though, when I go back into it, it says unless you, unless you, I'm trying to remember now, unless you would have used like the code that was in the the letter, they have no record of your payment."  
8:19	"So I'm like, I, I don't really know where they're told that at this point."  
8:24	"That was just like the frustrating thing 'cause it, I don't know if the letter was reflecting everything on when you go onto your va.gov site 'cause they, they, they do say on the side that like, unless you have the code we have, we, we have no way of tracking payments."  
8:40	Cause the payment obviously goes to Treasury dot obviously.  
8:42	"But I believe the payment, the issue was the payment is through treasury.gov or whatever."  
8:47	"And so then the V as like we, we can't, we can't tell you whether that got paid or not, basically."  
8:52	"So I'm like, great, OK, got it, got it."  
8:54	OK.  
8:55	And where do things currently stand with getting that result?  
8:59	"It's still showing, it's still showing the same thing September."  
9:04	"So I'm like, I don't want to pay it again, but it yeah, it's, it's September 15th."  
9:09	"It I actually, I checked it today and it's like the same, same information."  
9:15	Got it.  
9:15	OK.  
9:17	"And have you what, what steps have you taken to, to try to figure out just what is going on and what you can do that that I, I that that's as far as I've gone."  
9:29	"I thought that it was something that would like in, in the system or whatever would, would, you know, would get corrected or whatever, but it hasn't."  
9:37	"So I guess it's been, you know, over two months now."  
9:39	So I would probably need to reach out and just call.  
9:43	"I, I don't know."  
9:45	"I honestly don't know what number to I, I don't know if you just call her like the regular, what 800 number or they may say, maybe it says on va.gov who, who, who I could call, But then that would be my next step that I would have to do at at this point because it doesn't look like it's going to come off."  
10:02	"OK, got it."  
10:04	OK.  
10:06	So then I'd like to move into like how you manage finances from a pretty broad perspective.  
10:14	"So could be any you know bank statements or credit card utilities thing, you know things along those lines."  
10:21	"And I'm curious what sort of system, if you will, you might have in terms of managing all that."  
10:29	"And when I say managing, that could be looking at statements or making a phone call or sitting down and making payments."  
10:37	Yeah.  
10:37	"Talk to me about what sort of system you have in terms of paying bills and debts throughout, throughout the, the months."  
10:44	"So everything would be my, my, I, I guess I really thought so my system would just be for it to be, to be automated."  
10:52	I do try to have alerts set up really tied to like the credit and the debit cards so that if like basically I would get it.  
11:01	"I, I, I've said it almost the threshold's like really low because I've kind of gotten like burned."  
11:06	I'm sure we all have.  
11:08	"But like, you know, for the unauthorized charges, I want to catch them as quick as I can because that can get really annoying."  
11:16	"So I, I guess my system would be for like the regular, the regular like bills, like utilities, like you mentioned, like water, gas, all that stuff."  
11:29	"I do check, I checked the stuff that would get where usage would come into play."  
11:36	So more like my utility bill.  
11:38	I do monitor that like more closely.  
11:40	"Maybe maybe a lot of Americans are doing that now, but like I do monitor that closely for the usage, whatever."  
11:46	"But that would, you know, that all my bills would be, you know, deduct or they're automatically paid on the due date."  
11:57	And then some of the bills like I do monitor more closer than other.  
12:01	"I'm like, I'm not really digging into the weeds of my water bill 'cause it's usually consistent or my Internet bill."  
12:08	"But like the usage ones that are a little more expensive, I would I would monitor those more closely, but it would all the system would all be automatic payments on the date, you know, on or about the the due date."  
12:26	"OK, got it."  
12:26	And is there is there any way that you're confirming or or just or just checking up to make sure that everything does get paid?  
12:34	"Like I said, you've got things set up automatically."  
12:37	I get it.  
12:37	"I, I usually yeah."  
12:38	"So what I, it would get confirmed because I, I would get an e-mail and then I do, I do check my statement though, to make sure that that it's being debited or whatever it's getting, it's getting taken out like just so you can plan."  
12:55	"You always want to make sure there's enough in there, of course."  
12:57	"So like, so, yeah, like I, I usually would get an e-mail to confirm it and then I do verify it in the various apps I have for like the, you know, for your debit, like your banking accounts."  
13:11	"And when you say that you are verifying things in the app, what what is prompting you to do so at whatever day you happen to do that?"  
13:29	"So I guess it would be the what would prompt me to do it is just to make sure that I'm I'm coming in behind it, just to make sure that there that you have enough for each month."  
13:38	"So like I don't, I don't necessarily when I say it verify, I'm not verifying like when I'm with my gas and electric bill that the the day it it comes out, but I want to make sure like I did it's it's on the front or back end."  
13:51	"You want to make sure that there's enough obviously in the account, like before you pay it."  
13:55	"And then for any subsequent bill after you want to make sure that it's taken out or where it's, you want to make sure that it's accounted for before you go in and address another bill or whatever, or you're like you're planning for something else."  
14:08	So like I would verify on the front and the back end the like that there would be sufficient and then the sufficient for the bill and then sufficient after the bill.  
14:17	But you just want to make sure it's like been moved.  
14:20	"It's it's accounted for, I guess."  
14:22	Yeah.  
14:23	OK.  
14:23	And then what's your method of like making sure that you are doing that on at at the correct times?  
14:31	Is there is there something you have set up?  
14:33	"Yeah, my method would be I have a Google Calendar."  
14:38	"So every bill, like the big ones at least like the date, the date is supposed to be deducted is, is on my calendar."  
14:46	"And then like I have like, so yeah, it's just, it runs every every month or whatever."  
14:53	And then which bank account it would it would come from.  
14:56	"So, so yeah, that that'll pop up on the day when it's due until yeah, I can, yeah, I can."  
15:06	Like that week.  
15:06	"I'll, I'll take a look and like tell like, all right, this week we got this."  
15:10	"OK, got it."  
15:11	And then are you using or making use of any notifications from any apps for for minder or is or is it purely from your calendar and alerts that you've set up?  
15:23	"I do, you know, I do get, I get I get text alerts from like so the big yeah, I would get text alerts from like a lot of the utility stuff, gas, electric Internet, I can't remember if like cable is in there, but I I'll get tax alerts from the like so from the provider I'll get, I'll get an automated tax alert really when payments due, when payments been processed and stuff."  
15:50	And then the bank.  
15:51	"I can't, I'm trying to think if, if my bank, if any of them for like my like R note."  
16:00	"I think I do get an alert from my bank, I believe when that has been processed."  
16:07	OK.  
16:08	But usually it's from like separate apps or the the provider I sign up for alerts for that.  
16:15	"So I know when it's been, when the bill's been issued and then when it's been paid."  
16:19	Got it.  
16:19	"OK, So you got those as well."  
16:21	All right.  
16:23	So we're going to move into a bit of looking at prototypes and screen sharing.  
16:29	"Let me have you share your screen 1st, and then after that we're going to go through Figma and I'll get you a link to the prototype."  
16:37	"All right, There we go."  
16:57	And you can just tap outside of that.  
16:59	Got it.  
17:01	And now let me have you open up the Figma app and I have a test login to give you.  
17:12	Perfect go.  
17:15	Not now.  
17:17	"OK, it looks like you already have an account, so that is fine."  
17:20	"In that case, let me just send a link."  
17:24	Just a moment.  
17:27	"OK, If you want to go back to Figma and you can open up the link that I just sent."  
17:33	"Oh, I got it."  
17:39	Sorry.  
17:39	Back out of it.  
17:40	"Sorry, back back to Zoom."  
17:41	I misspoke.  
17:41	My apologies.  
17:42	"OK, yeah, so if you wanna tap in the middle and get to your the chat."  
17:51	"Oh, I just saw at the bottom tap on."  
17:52	"Yeah, I see."  
17:53	"Yeah, there's a OK, sorry."  
17:55	"Yep, Yep, the chat at the bottom."  
17:57	"OK, there we go."  
17:59	And then tap once on that extra long URL.  
18:04	"OK, alright, wait a moment for this to come up and you can swipe my video image out of the way to give you a little more screen share."  
18:12	Perfect screen Rezo.  
18:13	There we go.  
18:14	"Oh, right, here we go."  
18:16	"OK, so this is part of a sort of a representation of a little bit what you might see on the app."  
18:22	It's also a bit of just a general dashboard to get around to various parts that I want to bring you to.  
18:29	"So we're, we're going to be in a pretend scenario where you have you do have co-pay bills and then also from radical, sorry regular medical appointments plus some prescriptions and then also have some benefit overpayments."  
18:47	And I forgot to check before do do you know what a benefit overpayment is?  
18:55	"I, I, it would just be a guess if it, it would just be a guess."  
18:59	"I, I, I haven't heard that specific term."  
19:01	So.  
19:01	"OK, yeah, that's no problem."  
19:03	Yeah.  
19:03	"So what it is, is when the the veteran receives more, really more money than they are entitled to at that moment."  
19:13	"So it, and it could, it could happen for a variety of reasons."  
19:17	"One example I usually use is if they receive money for an education benefit, if they're signing up for some classes and then after they've received the money, they need to drop the class for whatever reason."  
19:29	"And so because they've already received that money, the VA says, OK, now you need to repay that money because you're not using it for education at that time."  
19:38	That's that's one example of a benefit overpayment.  
19:41	Sometimes it also happens if if dependents aren't updated for a variety of reasons.  
19:46	So sometimes it's generally if records with the VA don't match the money they are receiving.  
19:54	"OK, that is so yeah."  
19:56	"So in this in this situation, we're going to pretend that you have a few benefit overpayments from both disability and education benefits."  
20:05	And then also you have co-pay bills like I mentioned for some doctor visits and prescriptions.  
20:11	"So knowing that pretending being in your pretend situation before I have you tap into anything, any thoughts off the bat of?"  
20:22	If you would generally prefer to look at just the co-pays or just the overpayments or if you would want to look at everything together in what we're calling a combined statement.  
20:34	"Oh, so the combined, my initial thought was like, I would like it together."  
20:40	"Like I, I do like it together."  
20:43	So is the combined statement something you ought to be able to download is that or would it just appear on the app?  
20:49	"I guess either way, either way I do like I do like that that I can see it All right there like that was that was my initial reaction."  
20:57	Yeah.  
20:58	"OK, great."  
20:59	So let me have you tap into combined statement and we'll look at what this is.  
21:08	"OK, so the."  
21:09	Yeah.  
21:09	So scroll around.  
21:10	This is an example of what a combined statement might look like if if you had that pretend situation that I mentioned of having both the overpayments and the copays.  
22:17	"OK, Yeah."  
22:21	Thoughts on the information presented and how?  
22:25	"Yeah, thoughts on just how it's presented and how that might be useful or or not to you?"  
22:30	It it's detailed and it is.  
22:33	"So I guess the only there wouldn't be there wouldn't be it it's totaled up like and I and I guess there's probably no way to like, because I think we're talking about different like, so you're talking about VA healthcare and then you get into VA education."  
22:49	I guess you're covering everything that a veteran would potentially financially touch medical education and compensation.  
22:57	"So it is, yeah."  
22:59	"I mean, it, it, it makes sense to me the where it was like, I guess if you're in the, the disability and pension won the debt."  
23:12	I understand why that happened because that's showing.  
23:14	"Because if I guess what I'm seeing, it would be every month there would have been a change, I guess when it, when this, when this was discovered, I guess, or whatever."  
23:26	"So it makes sense like I'm sure when you add it all up like the pluses and the minuses, that's how you get down to the total."  
23:33	"That was a little like, I mean, they're a little hard to follow, but I, I think it, I mean it for for somebody in that position, it would, it makes sense."  
23:45	"And you probably have to you, you do have to show the change each month."  
23:47	"So I understand, I understand the thought process by it."  
23:50	"It makes, it makes sense."  
23:52	"Everything else like, yeah, you know, I was adding, not adding the model, of course, but like just that."  
24:01	"So like, yeah, I, I, I get where you're coming or where they're getting to the, the total due, which is kind of like what you want to know or, or whatever."  
24:09	"So yeah, I think, I think that would that's, that's helpful."  
24:16	"OK, got it."  
24:18	And are there things that like on on a page like this that would make it more useful for you?  
24:34	"I well, I guess my first question would be, let's see, does it?"  
24:40	I guess this is just a statement.  
24:42	"What I was going to say is say there it says how to resolve it that I would that's what I was going to ask is like, all right, so now I know what I owe."  
24:50	Like how do I how do I pay it?  
24:52	"I guess was my question, but that's that appears to be a link up there review and resolve co-pay bills."  
24:57	"So, yeah, I mean that that would, this makes sense to me."  
25:03	"Like it is, it's explaining where, where, where it happened."  
25:06	"Like, like it you should be able to know like where you were at on that day, like when you went for that visit."  
25:12	So I'm just looking at the medical stuff right now and then what I owe.  
25:15	"And so like, yeah, that that would answer my questions if I was reviewing this page for me, for myself."  
25:27	"OK, got it."  
25:28	"And then so I know you mentioned, you know, you, you like seeing that you could review and resolve the bills."  
25:34	"Are there other actions or decisions that you might want to take from this page here, the medical stuff?"  
25:47	"No, because like that assuming that, that assuming that, you know, myself being a veteran, that I can, I would confirm that, you know, I, I, I should be able to know like, you know, that those visits happened, you know, the disability and compensation that that's probably straightforward."  
26:06	Let's see what is the overpayment.  
26:20	"I I, the, the, the education stuff while in the moment."  
26:27	"So I, I don't know if that's the intent or whatever, but like the education stuff really wouldn't."  
26:33	"Again, as the veteran, you could probably under you, you would probably this wouldn't be the first time you're hearing about this."  
26:38	"So like you should know, like what what what is happening behind the scenes, Like why there would be a a decrease or whatever it it just says increase or decrease."  
26:47	Like the other ones like kind of like get a little bit more like the the medical stuff.  
26:51	"Like seems to have a little bit more information like, or at least I saw on some of them, like they were actually talking about like some of the medicine that was provided or the drugs."  
27:03	"Again, like you would probably know as a veteran, like why your education benefits are going up or down for whatever reason."  
27:09	But there could be like why did it?  
27:13	Why did it decrease?  
27:14	"Like, OK, so more, more, more description on that."  
27:18	Yeah.  
27:18	"I mean, you know, this is the first time seeing it."  
27:24	You wouldn't like if you didn't know anything about it like that would I would assume this still wouldn't be the first time you're seeing it.  
27:29	"But if it is like you really wouldn't have any idea, I guess."  
27:32	Yeah.  
27:32	"OK, got it."  
27:33	Got it.  
27:34	And then what are your thoughts on how you would prefer to interact with this type of information?  
27:40	And when I say how that could be on your mobile or on your laptop or desktop or predict things out or you only like PDFs or just an e-mail.  
27:51	What are your thoughts on on how you would want to be viewing and using this information?  
27:56	I would like to interact with it in the app.  
27:58	That'd be for me.  
27:59	"That'd be great 'cause it's like it's one of my, it, it, it's right near my home screen."  
28:05	"So like, you know, I don't need to, is this easier to log into?"  
28:14	"I mean, it's, it's simple things, but like when you know you can verifies your identity just with your face scan and then boom, we're in I'm into the app."  
28:21	"So like the more I can do in the app, the better for me personally, rather than logging in, like if I'm at work, I have to use my cat card to log in and like there's that whole processor even at home."  
28:31	"Like usually it's like, I think, I think the, the secondary thing would be like having a, a text message to my phone to like, so anyway, it's just quicker and easier."  
28:41	"Like the more I can do in the app from my standpoint like like that, that to me is like where I like it."  
28:51	"OK, good."  
28:51	And then maybe you scroll to the top of the screen here.  
28:58	"All right, what what is your assumption of what the download combined statement button will get you?"  
29:06	My assumption would be it would give me everything that I would just scroll through down there.  
29:11	"So all the charges and the information, the increase or decrease for the various VA benefits or yeah, that I would it it would give me whatever I just scrolled through."  
29:26	It should give me all of that in a in a downloadable like a form that I could save or e-mail or whatever.  
29:33	"OK, great."  
29:34	And then maybe tap on that and see if that matches what you actually see.  
29:42	"Yeah, well, actually wait, this is for it seems more detailed, right?"  
29:53	"Or my maybe that I I scrolled through it so fast that it like at first glance there seems to be more entries, but it maybe is the same amount of entries."  
30:04	"It's only three pages, so it might be the same thing."  
30:09	It's it is actually the same information.  
30:12	Can you say more about how how this appears to give you more information whether the line items are like would it appear?  
30:23	But it was so there.  
30:26	"I mean, there's obviously a a bunch of lines with the amount dew."  
30:33	"OK, it it, it would just be a smaller print and, and, and you know, more lines when I say like it, it appears to be more entries, more individual entries rather than than not."  
30:48	"But obviously I was second guessing myself as I as I was talking, but I do like the total."  
30:56	"So yeah, I would read more like a traditional like financial document, I suppose, but OK, yeah."  
31:02	And then thoughts on would this be something that you might like to use compared with the list that you just that you just looked at?  
31:11	"I would, yeah, I would like to use it because it's like this is something that like you could like if you're so inclined, you could historically save this."  
31:19	"Like this could be like part of your like documentation that you keep just for tracking of your own purposes rather than like, you know, the actual web page like this."  
31:28	"You can, this is something you can save and it's like you're one of those guys you could like store it in and use it for whatever, you know, budgeting or whatever purposes you want to use it for in the future."  
31:40	Like it's a searchable document that that can be referenced at any point.  
31:45	I got it.  
31:46	And would this be something you would print or just view on a screen?  
31:51	More than likely I would just view and then and then save.  
31:55	I wouldn't print it unless I needed to provide it to somebody.  
31:58	I would just save it.  
31:59	"And yeah, OK, so, so just so I'm understanding it."  
32:03	"So it sounds like this is less for reading the details, but more for saving for any sort of future records."  
32:10	"Yeah, exactly."  
32:11	OK good.  
32:12	So let me have you tap done.  
32:14	We're going to get back to the previous screen.  
32:16	Yeah.  
32:18	"And so looking at back on this page here on a scale of one to five, how overwhelming or not does this feel to you?"  
32:27	"5 being very overwhelming, one being not one, one."  
32:32	"OK, Yeah, not overwhelming."  
32:34	Great.  
32:35	OK.  
32:36	"And then any, any further thoughts on this view versus the PDF view that we just looked at?"  
32:44	"I mean, this, this view is like significantly easier to read."  
32:48	"Yeah, this would be preferred."  
32:53	"I I prefer, I like having the PDF option just for like, you know, for whatever reason you would need in the future."  
32:59	"But like this, this is the view I would prefer to see."  
33:03	"It's just it's, it's easier on the eyes and everything."  
33:07	"So it's like, yeah, OK, I got it."  
33:09	We'll maybe tap home at the bottom of the screen there.  
33:13	"OK, so now we're going to get into some other designs that are not currently, well, anywhere."  
33:20	So maybe tap on future version B on the right hand side.  
33:25	"OK, so this is another version again, all the the numbers are all the same."  
33:31	"So the number of bills or the number of debts that you have is all the same, but we're in a different format here."  
33:36	So have a look around and let me know thoughts on how this information is presented.  
33:53	"I do like this it, it's, it's like, I guess it's like, it's just, it's like, I mean intuitive, I guess I don't know like the automatic Intel that you can like open this up."  
34:08	"Like this is like a, you know, a specific place that, you know, you as the veteran you went to and you know, the the IT it, you know, sums it all up."  
34:18	"And then like the bottom line is what what I would owe, I'm just clicking down."  
34:27	"So yeah, they give these two clinics."  
34:29	Obviously that's pretty detailed.  
34:37	"OK, I get it."  
34:39	So I'm assuming I just wanted to check one thing.  
34:43	25 shoot.  
34:51	"Yeah, yeah, it makes yeah."  
34:52	So like I get it now.  
34:57	"I mean, it was, but anyway, the total bill and then you you can get into the the total bill, what I would owe and it it all comes from the the below."  
35:08	"Yeah, I guess the most important thing is right there in the front, like what I owe and then and then it and then it tells you why and from what purpose."  
35:21	So yeah.  
35:24	"And then how about considering in this pretend scenario where you have both co-pays and overpayments, what about that experience and knowing that that that you have both, how would you want to use this?"  
35:38	I guess so like do I OK?  
35:42	Is that OK if I did that?  
35:43	"OK, so I didn't."  
36:25	"Yeah, it would be the same thing as far as like my impression of it."  
36:30	"I, I, I like it."  
36:32	"It's it, it, you know, it's, it's just in a similar manner like the bottom line is, would be right there up front for you and then it gets into the, you know, the why."  
36:41	"So I guess the overpayments would, it would only come from like education or compensation."  
36:47	I'm guessing that that makes sense to me.  
36:50	"So yeah, you know, if you have any questions as to like when it started or whatever, that's right there like that, that's when the changes were to happen."  
36:59	So and it titles it all up.  
37:03	Like obviously you can dispute that with the VA later on or whatever what you think is right or not.  
37:08	But it there it tells you right up front like what the issue is and like how much you owe.  
37:13	"And so, yeah, that both tabs look good to me."  
37:20	"OK, got it."  
37:21	"And then comparing this view here with the two different tabs, any, any thoughts on using this versus the PDF view?"  
37:32	"I know before you said you would generally just file that away, but seeing this tab view versus the PDF view, any, any anything to add with when you might use one over the other?"  
37:44	I would I would definitely want to use this one.  
37:46	"So the PDF, I guess where where I would use that is if I, if I had, if I was under the impression that I was right and DA was wrong, that's when I maybe would like, I would maybe use that to sit down and dig into it and see like, what if these charges make sense?"  
38:04	"You could, I guess you could use bill."  
38:05	"That PDF would just be a like a longer like I just associate that to like actually sitting down and working on something rather than viewing like the because I think it's going to say it's going to tell you probably the same information, but you're maybe doing it with combined with something else."  
38:21	You give a reason why you think these charges are not are not accurate.  
38:27	"The PD the the tab view, though, is just going to give you a quick and it's going to give you the same information, but it would just give you like as long as you don't have an issue with what you're seeing, then you can just get to a decision or you'll you'll, you can just resolve your your situation a lot sooner."  
38:45	"Like if you if you knew this was going to come, like you were getting compensated too much, like you didn't report you're you're dependent getting getting to 19 or something like that."  
38:53	"Like you're like, Yep, Yep, makes sense."  
38:55	"Like right there or, or whatever you owe co-pay for this visit."  
38:59	"Like, yeah, it's just a quicker resolution to like, all right, let me go pay this bill real quick."  
39:05	So that's like that's why I like the app or whatever.  
39:10	This this just speed.  
39:12	"It could speed up your decision and resolution, I think quicker."  
39:17	"OK, got it."  
39:18	"All right, so we're I'm going to send you in another location just a moment."  
39:21	So we're going to compare this view.  
39:23	"You're seeing the two different tabs where you can go back and forth between the co-pays and the overpays and then tap on the payments on the lower right, that little tab there."  
39:36	Yeah.  
39:36	And go into co-pay bills.  
39:38	So we're going to compare the two tabbed version to looking at just the co-pays separately from the overpays.  
39:46	"And again, this is the same, the same numbers, all the basic information in this pretend scenario."  
40:19	"I mean, yeah, this is, it makes sense to me."  
40:30	It's an easy way to take care of a take care of your of your co-pay bill.  
40:41	"Again, you wouldn't it it it's right up front."  
40:44	"Like I, I like it because I can, I guess the details would just be yeah."  
40:53	"So this gives me the OK, this does give you a lot."  
40:58	This allows you to to download it and do whatever you want with it.  
41:07	"Yeah, I think that's helpful."  
41:09	"Having it right there, right there in the in the tab."  
41:14	"OK, I got it."  
41:14	"And let me have you tap again the, the payments on the lower right back to yeah."  
41:21	And then tap on overpayments.  
41:23	"OK, so it's a similar thing."  
41:25	This now gives you all of your overpayments in a similar format.  
41:29	I do like this.  
41:30	"I, I this also I do like again, we're we're probably getting to the same, the same total for resolving all this."  
41:40	"But you know it, it gives you the balance."  
41:47	So current balance.  
41:49	"All right, So that's what you would OK, got it."  
41:51	So that's what you would owe.  
41:57	I like it.  
41:58	"I like it 'cause it it, it, it, it's right there balancing or you know, your balance for the, the various debts are right there and then it gives you the option of of of resolving it with, with like I guess one click."  
42:14	"OK, I got it."  
42:15	"And OK, so, so considering like this, this section which is all over payments and then the other section you went into versus with the co-pays."  
42:26	Thoughts on comparing that experience to the view where you had the two different tabs that you can go back and forth or when like is does 1 stand out as being more useful to you than the other?  
42:40	"And if if you want to tap back into payments on the lower right, you can get back to that 210, the combined statement right in the middle."  
42:48	Yep.  
42:52	"I like, I like the the last one this this view right here."  
43:01	"Yeah, OK, I, I like that one."  
43:03	It's just it's it's just right there up front.  
43:06	"You know, if you, if you do have a debt, it's just automatically, I'm just looking, I mean it, that's right there too."  
43:14	I don't know.  
43:15	"I, I do like the, it's, I guess I just like that view better."  
43:27	"Like when, when, when it comes to when it comes to resolving that, like it's right there."  
43:30	The balance is right there.  
43:31	"Obviously you can get into disputes and all that, but like it's right there and then it's assuming everything is, is, is on you're, you're in agreement with, you can resolve it like immediately."  
43:43	"You can review the details with the same amount of like you can review the details easily, but I do like this current view that I'm on right now."  
43:51	OK.  
43:51	And that and is that primarily coming from easily resolving it or are there are there reason?  
43:57	Yeah.  
43:57	"OK, got it."  
44:00	"And any thoughts of looking at I Oh, sorry."  
44:05	"Yeah, I lost my audio."  
44:11	"Oh, OK."  
44:13	Can you are you able to hear me?  
44:14	"Yeah, I can hear you now."  
44:15	Sorry.  
44:15	Yeah.  
44:16	Yeah.  
44:16	"No, I can still hear you."  
44:17	Fine.  
44:17	So.  
44:18	OK.  
44:18	Yep.  
44:19	All right.  
44:19	"If you want to switch back to Figma, I'm now seeing this, the Zoom sharing screen."  
44:25	Can you just say that again?  
44:26	I might.  
44:27	"Oh, is it?"  
44:28	Yeah.  
44:28	If you could switch back to Figma.  
44:29	I'm just seeing the the.  
44:30	"Oh, Yep."  
44:31	Yep.  
44:34	Let's see.  
44:34	Sorry.  
44:35	"OK, got it."  
44:36	"OK, thank you."  
44:38	"So I'm so I know you said you, you like this view better, it's easier to resolve anything that you need to do."  
44:47	How about any level or any differing level of trust with the information meaning looking at the individual overpayments or Co payments versus seeing everything in that 2 tab or even the the long list view if one seems any more trustworthy to you.  
45:13	"So in that for that question, the long the the the the a version would seem more trustworthy."  
45:23	"It, it, it gets it 'cause it gets this is the one where like for the I know for the, the, the compensation one it, it, it gave it went like month by month."  
45:35	"So like that, like, you know, would be like an itemized."  
45:41	Let me just see what it does when I review the details.  
45:46	"I guess, I guess it does that."  
45:49	"I guess you're getting the same information, but like the other one did seem to be more more detailed initially."  
45:59	"Yeah, the one with the the two tabs looked more like a detail."  
46:04	Yeah.  
46:04	"OK, got it."  
46:05	All right.  
46:05	And and you feel like that that leads to being more trustworthy.  
46:09	Yeah.  
46:10	"OK, got it."  
46:13	"And then let's see, how about tap back into the combined statement?"  
46:24	"OK, so this is combined statement A."  
46:28	And let me have you scroll all the way down and I'm going to have you go to version B and just see some differences there.  
46:35	"Yes, tap on B."  
46:38	Any differences jump out at you between A\&B?  
46:43	This one's B here.  
47:05	"I'm not sure if I see like I mean did a I, I, I I'd have to go back and look."  
47:10	"I don't know if the, I can't remember if the the total due was at the top for a, for a or not, but they seem to both have like the itemized more or less like received, sorry, received and then the balance and then the balance due."  
47:26	"So, yeah, so the there, there's just the one difference that I'll I'll point out."  
47:34	"So on this on this page here where it says co-pay bills and the little circle next to it, if you if you tap on that, it expands a little bit and shows you some information."  
47:44	"Yeah, the you're receiving this billing statement, etcetera."  
47:47	"And then on the other one, that information is is always there instead of last."  
47:56	So thoughts on the usefulness of that information.  
48:10	OK.  
48:10	Yeah.  
48:10	So like not all veterans.  
48:15	So I guess this is what this is saying.  
48:19	"It's basically like letting you know because of your priority group, you're gonna get like, you're gonna get that."  
48:25	"Yeah, yeah, that that is useful."  
48:28	"Like the veteran should, should have an understanding."  
48:30	"But I so I guess I wouldn't mind seeing like what part of the group I'm in like, yeah, like I don't even honestly as the veteran or like I think they're one through 8 or something like that."  
48:49	Yeah.  
48:49	"Like that would be my own, my only thing yeah OK, good."  
48:56	And so so is that it it is useful.  
48:59	"It is useful because like you don't want to assume like like, yes, I'm getting this because I, I'm in a I'm in a priority group and just like, why am I getting this bill?"  
49:09	"Like, yeah, that that is useful."  
49:11	"OK, good."  
49:12	And would you thoughts on if you would prefer this version where the information is actually collapsed first as opposed to the other version where that information is always there as always viewable or I get collapsed and then it allows me to open it if I want to.  
49:28	OK.  
49:28	I like the collapsed.  
49:29	Got it.  
49:30	OK.  
49:33	"And let me see, I'm going to check in."  
49:38	"Oh, I did have a sense you had mentioned you weren't sure what a next step might be to resolve the issue with your co-pay."  
49:48	"I I did have my team pull up a number that you can call just yeah, so they work on the financial management team to."  
49:57	So this will be the best number of so it's the the debt management center.  
50:02	Do you want me to?  
50:03	"I could put the number in the chat if you want, or I can just read it out for you."  
50:08	What?  
50:09	What My view?  
50:10	I'm just gonna.  
50:11	Let's see.  
50:15	Yeah.  
50:15	If you could just read it out.  
50:16	I can type it.  
50:17	Yeah.  
50:17	So.  
50:17	"OK, So."  
50:18	"Debt Management Center 800, 827."  
50:24	"Emily, sorry, I think you're reading the wrong number."  
50:27	You want the number for the Health Resource Center.  
50:30	Thank you.  
50:31	Thanks.  
50:31	"See, good thing people are reading the things."  
50:32	"OK, Health Resource Center."  
50:35	"Oh, so we need that as not the Debt Management Center."  
50:39	Is that right?  
50:40	I'm not sure.  
50:41	I don't know the differences between these numbers here.  
50:44	"Yeah, since he doesn't have any overpayments, he would need to call the Health Resource Center for."  
50:49	Thank you.  
50:50	Thank you.  
50:50	OK.  
50:51	"Yes, This is why I asked my team to to check up on me."  
50:55	So try that again.  
50:56	Scratch that number.  
50:57	I was trying to tell you.  
50:59	So the Health Resource Center is 866-400-1238.  
51:07	OK.  
51:08	Yeah.  
51:08	So that's the the Health Resource Center should be able to help you.  
51:12	"OK, OK."
