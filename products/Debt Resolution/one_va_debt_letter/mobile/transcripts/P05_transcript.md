0:00	Cloud.			  
0:01	"OK, great."			  
0:02	"So now that we are recording, are you OK if I record the video and audio today?"			  
0:08	That's fine.			  
0:09	"OK, great."			  
0:10	"And are you OK if we share any VAS or any clips of this session with our VA partners, that is fine as well."			  
0:18	Great.			  
0:18	Thank you so much.			  
0:19	"All right, so first I'd love to tell you the to know at whatever level you're comfortable a little bit about yourself as a veteran, maybe what what branch you served and when you retired or separated active duty \[redacted\] from 1989 to 1998 had a little bit of a mess at the end of that time."			  
0:47	"OK, medically separated."			  
0:49	"Oh, got it."			  
0:52	But I should have been medically retired.			  
0:55	"And I think about 22 years for them to realize that they've made a mistake and oh goodness, changed everything to retirement."			  
1:01	"Oh, oh, wow."			  
1:03	All right.			  
1:07	And then any I'd like to know overall what or how you have been involved with Veteran Affairs over the years.			  
1:16	"So I've been, that's my, that's my medical separation of time."			  
1:22	"I, I separated in 1998."			  
1:25	I think I got into the VA healthcare system about 2000 ish 2002 and have been in the VA healthcare system since.			  
1:38	"OK, got it got it."			  
1:40	And then what sort of experience with the VA website or the VA app have you had?			  
1:47	"So I, I my primary use of the VA website or app has been BTS 3 Travel."			  
2:05	"Oh, OK, got it."			  
2:06	I use that quite a bit.			  
2:09	That's one of the reasons my camera's off.			  
2:10	"I'm sitting here waiting to go to another community care appointment, just waiting for for it."			  
2:15	So I'm sitting in my truck.			  
2:18	So I used BTS 3 nearly daily with some issues and then of course I will use the mainly the the VA website up till recently using the VA website to to access medical records or to do prescription refills.			  
2:44	"OK, got it."			  
2:46	And then how about anytime with the the mobile app specifically when might you be using that?			  
2:58	"Just very recently I've started using it because I know that there's been a lot of changes to the, to the, to the technology."			  
3:07	"And I use it recently to get to the, to the, the healthcare side to like, like I said, to either access medical records, send a secure message or, or order prescriptions using the app as opposed to va.gov and going that route or my health or more used."			  
3:28	I was a user of my healthy vet a lot until they done away with it.			  
3:33	Got it got it.			  
3:34	And in what instances do you specifically choose to use the app over the OR I I guess why?			  
3:41	Why do you choose to use the app over our website at any time?			  
3:47	"Sorry, I've had \[redacted\] I had to think about while wording a little bit."			  
3:54	"I have the app on my phone, so it's, it's very convenient to just use the app and automatically log on as opposed to going through the website and have to do the the, the the security verification."			  
4:15	The code sent to me.			  
4:16	"The way it's set up now on my phone, I can just, it does the facial recognition and connects you right to the VA website."			  
4:23	"Oh, got it, got it."			  
4:24	And you said that that the app recently had some technical updates.			  
4:30	"I'm wondering how you learned about those updates or like, yeah, did someone tell you?"			  
4:34	Did you read about it somewhere?			  
4:36	I knew that I had heard that the amount of healthy vet was going away.			  
4:41	I am also a I'm associate with the disabled American vets.			  
4:46	I'm a \[redacted\]			  
4:49	So I have to I keep track of what's going on in the VA realm as well as other things that are going on in the veteran community.			  
5:01	"OK, got it."			  
5:02	Great.			  
5:02	"All right, so now we're going to move over to the financial portion of the discussion and I want to make sure that you're only sharing only thing, only that things that you are comfortable."			  
5:13	"Like I said, I have no information into anything about your personal records or anything."			  
5:20	So first love to hear at whatever level you're comfortable what sort of experience you have had with benefit overpayments.			  
5:30	"I have had, I've run into issues in the past with particularly travel, travel overpayments, which are actually errors on the VA part that have to have had to go through the process of getting fixed."			  
5:54	Probably the best way to explain it.			  
5:56	Yeah.			  
5:56	OK.			  
5:57	"And then I've had, there was there about a year ago, I had a a civilian emergency room visit that the the VA wanted to recoup, recoup for me."			  
6:12	And that's still a work in progress as well.			  
6:15	"It's all, it's all working through things."			  
6:19	Got it.			  
6:19	OK.			  
6:20	"So with the, the, the travel overpayments, do you recall how you first learned of this letters to the from the VA letter, letters to my local VA Medical Center."			  
6:36	I know that there's been some changes.			  
6:38	"I know I don't want to assume that you are also familiar with the BTS 3 side of things, but yeah, not, not, not very much no."			  
6:48	"So up till recently with the last within the last year, the at least here my \[redacted\], they have gone away from processing travel claims locally in house and are all travel claims for the \[redacted\] are being processed off site someplace somebody, somebody else is processing them."			  
7:23	"So it's just a just a little bit of a change, technological change a little bit so faster, but still it's not without its problems."			  
7:41	Got it.			  
7:42	"So you said you you received letters were before these letters arrived, were you aware that this that that these overpayments were coming or or what was was it a surprise when it arrived?"			  
7:56	So you don't find out whenever you don't realize until after the fact.			  
8:00	Got it.			  
8:01	"OK, sorry too late."			  
8:03	Got it.			  
8:03	"OK, excuse me."			  
8:05	"And when the information did arrive, was it, was it clear what it was?"			  
8:11	Was it clear what your options were?			  
8:15	"I would say clear what it was because I, I, I'm somewhat familiar with the travel system."			  
8:23	"Not the most clear, not the most clear what the options are, especially with dealing with with how to deal with what was it debt management, whatever I forgot what they're called debt manager, whatever the their office is not that they're not the clearest on how to deal with them."			  
8:41	"OK, all right."			  
8:46	"And has there's a outside of the the original letter you received, has there, has there been other communication regarding this that you you have received?"			  
8:54	"So I would, I would typically get a letter from local VA folks."			  
9:00	"The the office was telling me that there's a there's a problem, then I'll get the letter or get the more details from that management explaining how to how to resolve it, what what the options are to resolve it."			  
9:18	"Oh, OK, got it."			  
9:21	"And then with medical co-pays, so are are you, I know you mentioned there was an, an issue with an, an an extra visit."			  
9:33	"Are you regularly paying co-pays for, for any of your other healthcare?"			  
9:37	"No, no, no, OK, got it."			  
9:40	And there's that really wasn't a co-pay.			  
9:42	It was an emergency room visit.			  
9:45	So the emergency room billed the VA and the VA wouldn't cover it.			  
9:54	"Oh, I see, I see."			  
9:55	"OK, got it."			  
9:56	"I know there's been some changes since make the VA start paying these, these emergency room visits."			  
10:04	Just the the timing did not work out for me.			  
10:06	"Oh, got it."			  
10:07	OK.			  
10:08	"And then so similar question is with the, the, the travel."			  
10:13	What was that all?			  
10:15	Did you also learn about that from a letter?			  
10:19	"Yes, OK, got it."			  
10:21	"And then same kind of thing was it, how was that communication in terms of what your options were what what you had to do next."			  
10:29	"Again, the similar to these to the other one were understand what what had happened just not the best from what I recall from letters not the best way to address it with debt management to get that taken care of."			  
10:50	"Well, how how are you currently working with debt management at this moment in time?"			  
10:55	I'm not I'm waiting for the the issues are being looked into now the everything's on hold.			  
11:07	"OK, got it."			  
11:09	And is that something that you are able to log into your account and see any updates or are you just contacting debt management directly?			  
11:18	I'm just kind of contacting debt management directly.			  
11:21	"OK, got it."			  
11:23	"OK, So now I want to ask you about times that you're actively and, and this this could be outside of just Virginia, but like actively managing any sort of debt or bills that you need to pay."			  
11:38	And that could be making phone calls or deciding how to pay things.			  
11:45	"When are, or do you have a particular time or place that you're doing that?"			  
11:50	"Like could be different time of of the month or if you are in a physical location, like talk to me about when you are doing any sort of financial management."			  
12:02	"Oh, it's typically at home, usually around the beginning of the end of or the beginning of the month, but it can happen throughout the month because of just how my bills come in just on the timing of the bills itself so that they're they're spread out through the month."			  
12:22	"So I'm working on them all the time, but also like focusing on the on the main bills come at the beginning or the end of the month, depending on just what's going on."			  
12:37	Just happened to me when I start doing them.			  
12:39	"Oh, got it."			  
12:39	"OK, And then what is like whenever you are doing any sort of financial management, what is prompting you to, to, to work on any, any of your finances?"			  
12:54	Nothing just happened to be the I know the bills are due and just happened to know that I need to take care of them.			  
13:01	"OK, do you have a method for keeping track of when particular ones are due?"			  
13:09	"Not particularly other than dropping as I I receive e-mail notices from credit card, for example, I'll drop them into a folder on my on my phone and know they come back and look at it and take care of them before they're due."			  
13:28	"Oh, OK, so this is all within e-mail that you're keeping track of this."			  
13:31	"Oh yeah, pretty much pretty much everything that I have comes all my bills pretty much come through e-mail or through an through their dedicated app."			  
13:40	Got it.			  
13:40	"Typically, typically I'll get both, but like a lot of them will."			  
13:46	"Yeah, it's OK."			  
13:47	Your Bill's due in 10 days and I'll get that either through the app or through through an e-mail.			  
13:54	I'll know the they were trigger me to make sure I take care of it.			  
13:57	OK got it.			  
13:59	"OK, so is any anything else beyond those emails that might prompt you to to work on your finances?"			  
14:09	Not particularly now.			  
14:10	Got it.			  
14:11	"OK, so the emails come through, all right."			  
14:14	"And then thinking about, let's see, thinking about both."			  
14:20	I know you said you've you've had that you've got current issues with the emergency room visit with the the travel pay overpayment.			  
14:32	Are you thinking of those in like as one as one type of thing or is or as as as separate things within the VA?			  
14:47	"I'm sorry, I can't, I, I don't know how to answer that one that I don't, I don't know how to know 1 So yeah, no, that, that that's fine."			  
14:54	That's fine.			  
14:55	No worries.			  
14:58	"And so you said, so anytime you're making payments that that's, that's more like whenever you learn that, that a bill is due, it's, it's not a, you're not, you're not grouping this much."			  
15:07	"Some of well, probably a 75% of my bills come up all at once at the, like I said, at the very beginning or the end of the month."			  
15:17	So they'll they'll get taken care of because I right off the bat immediately right then and there.			  
15:22	"But there are, but there are a couple of the bills that come like towards the middle after first or second week, so middle of the month."			  
15:30	So I'll just remember to get to them whenever I have the time to sit down and work on them.			  
15:38	"OK, got it."			  
15:40	And is there anything that you find that might be challenging or confusing in terms of keeping track of when you need to make payments?			  
15:49	"Not, not, not particularly now because like I said it, the the these private company type creditor apps or emails are, are work pretty good."			  
16:04	"Yeah, OK."			  
16:04	"They're, they're, they're informative and they give, they'll they'll give me a plenty of heads up to to make sure I don't that I'm not late."			  
16:16	"OK, all right, That's, that's certainly helpful."			  
16:19	"Are there so do you get those, those, those heads up notifications from from everybody?"			  
16:30	"Those that are coming through the those of those bills that I don't pay automatically at the at the beginning or end of the month, those that don't they, they seem to all I can remember, I don't remember."			  
16:44	"I don't, I don't know if any of that don't give me a, a warning."			  
16:49	"They'll give me the 10 days or so saying, hey, like I got one just a couple days ago."			  
16:53	"Hey, this credit card is due and on the 17th."			  
16:55	"OK, got it."			  
16:59	"OK, So we're going to move into looking at a prototype."			  
17:05	So first I'd like to have you share your screen.			  
17:08	Have you done this before with?			  
17:11	"OK, so if you tap on the screen, there should be an option toward the bottom that says share might have a little rectangle screen."			  
17:33	"All right, Yep."			  
17:34	And I think you can just tap outside of that rectangle.			  
17:38	"Yeah, perfect."			  
17:38	All right.			  
17:40	"And then if you can go to the Figma app, I'm going to have you log in there with a a test account that I've got."			  
17:51	You can actually swipe the the image of my video off to the right or left.			  
17:58	"Yeah, there you go."			  
17:59	Perfect.			  
17:59	Easier to see that way.			  
18:05	"OK, so tap in the login to Figma."			  
18:10	"Yeah, go ahead and continue."			  
18:14	"OK, so under e-mail it's going to be VA test 000 at gmail.com."			  
18:34	Great.			  
18:34	"And then the password, it's a long one, but it is a it is a pattern."			  
18:39	So hopefully this will be easy to see.			  
18:43	"Oh, this, this is a Figma thing, nothing to do with the VA right now."			  
18:47	"OK, so it's capital AZSXDCFV 2468."			  
19:09	All good.			  
19:09	"And yeah, yeah, sorry."			  
19:10	And then login and then that should ask for.			  
19:15	Don't need to save that.			  
19:16	Yeah.			  
19:16	"Oh, there we go."			  
19:19	OK.			  
19:20	"Oh, that just logged you in."			  
19:21	Great.			  
19:21	"OK, so don't open those quite yet."			  
19:24	What I'm actually going to do is send you a different link.			  
19:29	Wait just a moment.			  
19:30	I'm sending a link.			  
19:32	"OK, so I'm going to go back to Zoom because I just sent a link in the Zoom app."			  
19:47	Switch back.			  
19:48	"Yeah, you have to switch back to Zoom."			  
19:51	Let's see.			  
19:54	"Oh, there we go."			  
19:55	So the the chat with a tiny red one.			  
19:57	There we go.			  
19:58	Tap on that once and that should open up.			  
20:01	"Yeah, tap on that long URL there."			  
20:05	"All right, that should open there."			  
20:08	Great.			  
20:09	It's coming.			  
20:10	It's coming.			  
20:10	That's a little bit slow.			  
20:16	"And if you want to swipe my video picture off to the side again, give you more space."			  
20:21	Perfect.			  
20:21	"Hooray, it worked."			  
20:22	I love when this works.			  
20:24	"OK, so we're going to."			  
20:26	And you can tap anywhere outside of those blue.			  
20:28	Yeah.			  
20:29	There we go.			  
20:29	I'm going to give you directions in just a moment.			  
20:32	"So we in this example, we're going to pretend that you have some overpayment debt from a couple different benefits and you also have some medical co-pays from some regular doctor visits and prescriptions."			  
20:47	So pretending that you have both of those.			  
20:50	"Any thought before I have you tap into anything, any thoughts about whether you might like to look at each of those separately, the co-pay separately, the overpayment separately or if you might like to look at everything at once?"			  
21:10	"No, doesn't matter, doesn't matter."			  
21:13	"OK, that's fine."			  
21:16	"We'll have you look at everything and then then perhaps you'll, you'll have an idea."			  
21:20	"Let me have actually before you tap into that, what is your, I'm going to have you tap into combined statement in just a moment."			  
21:27	"But what are your thoughts about what you might what, what do you expect to find there?"			  
21:37	"Well, it's similar to a regular like a a typical creditor's bill or it has a like a statement with the date and the nature to charge and the option of being able to pay it."			  
21:59	"OK, great."			  
21:59	Thanks guys.			  
22:00	"Yep, Yep."			  
22:00	"All right, So tap into where it says combined statement."			  
22:05	"OK, so you can scroll around to your look around."			  
22:08	"So again, this is in this situation, we're pretending that you have a few co-pays and you also have some overpayment, some benefit overpayments."			  
22:17	"Look around and yeah, share any thoughts that you have about what you are seeing here."			  
22:32	It seems to make sense.			  
22:35	OK.			  
22:38	And how does this compare to what you were expecting it?			  
22:47	This seems to to me it it's giving me the information I'm looking for to make the payment to to take care of it.			  
22:56	So it it seems to be like like a better word spot on what I'm looking for.			  
23:03	"OK, good."			  
23:04	"And what, since you said this would be what you needed to to make payments specifically, what information would you want here to, to make this a useful tool?"			  
23:16	"Again, going a different breakdown of what the the individual Co payments are for."			  
23:30	"Mind you, I don't I don't have Co payments."			  
23:32	I'm \[redacted\] so I don't have Co payments.			  
23:34	So I have to think about this a little bit wording a little bit more.			  
23:37	So it's giving a a detail of what of the what the individual had a thought what the individual payments or 4\.			  
23:51	"Especially when they're saying, hey, you owe $75 Co payments gives me a breakdown of what the what they are."			  
23:59	The only thing that I wouldn't mind is if I can click on billing reference and see more details about the actual event.			  
24:19	"Mm hmm, OK, makes sense."			  
24:21	Yep.			  
24:21	OK.			  
24:23	"And then actually, if you want to continue scrolling down just so, you can also see the benefit overpayment section as well."			  
24:55	Let me stop right there.			  
24:57	Sure.			  
24:57	"Yeah, yeah."			  
24:58	"Any, yeah."			  
25:00	"Any any thoughts on the information presenting here in terms of making it useful for you again, probably someplace down here towards the bottom or someplace in that section, maybe a link to the original document where you had the the details of where they came up with the 1395 from."			  
25:25	Does that make sense?			  
25:25	The overpayment?			  
25:26	Yep.			  
25:28	"So something will link back to a document, whether here be an overpayment where the 1395 comes from or for the Co payments where the outpatient visit came from like a regular bill bill where it goes into a little bit of details of what, where they came up with this number."			  
25:53	"OK, got it, got it."			  
25:55	"OK, And let me have you scroll to the top."			  
25:57	I'm going to have you look at something else.			  
26:04	"OK, so where it says sorry, download combined statement, what is your assumption about what that would be maybe a all this information here and one document that can be printed or downloaded or saved."			  
26:31	Mm Hmm.			  
26:33	"OK, got it."			  
26:35	Let me have you tap on that Exactly.			  
26:41	OK Yeah.			  
26:41	So this is what you were expecting?			  
26:44	That's why.			  
26:44	"Yeah, I was."			  
26:45	I'm thinking of whenever.			  
26:46	Yeah.			  
26:48	"OK, got it."			  
26:49	"And are you, do you ever interact and view PDFs on your phone now at any time You started to break up?"			  
27:01	"I missed, I missed everything about phone."			  
27:04	"Oh good, I got it right now on your phone."			  
27:07	Do you are there any times that you are looking at PDFs like a statement like this on your phone?			  
27:14	I do you do OK And can you tell me more about like how you are viewing things or what you are doing with these PDFs?			  
27:25	Typically I would have to save it to my phone because it from here it does not give me an option to zoom in.			  
27:33	"So it's not the best thing to try to to try to look at, especially on a phone 'cause you can't see it, it's too small."			  
27:45	You have to save it.			  
27:46	"You got to save it and reopen it to be able to zoom in and zoom out, pinch in or pinch out."			  
27:52	"OK, so that, that that's actually a prototype issue."			  
27:55	"So if you do one tap in the middle, it will do a, a very big zoom just to yeah, there we go."			  
28:03	Just so you can see what it might lead.			  
28:05	This is obviously not what the real app would do.			  
28:07	"You would be able to, you know, pinch in and out."			  
28:09	But this is just a representation I'm trying to remember.			  
28:15	"I think that I would, I think that I would have to still save it and reopen it to actually pinch and zoom it."			  
28:28	"Oh God, I, I think so."			  
28:30	I think.			  
28:31	"Oh, got it."			  
28:32	Do you know offhand what app you open it in when you're pinching and zooming Adobe?			  
28:38	Adobe basically saving saving this.			  
28:42	"Sorry, basically saving using the using the the square arrow thing up in the upper right hand corner."			  
28:53	"Yep, Yep."			  
28:53	Saving it to my device and then reopening the document in Adobe from opening the files in Adobe from from where it's saved up.			  
29:05	Got it.			  
29:05	"OK, great."			  
29:06	OK.			  
29:07	"And then so any thoughts of this information that we're viewing right here compared with the view we were just looking at with everything in one column, thoughts on do you prefer one over the other?"			  
29:25	How do you how do you compare the two?			  
29:27	"If you want to press done, you'll be you can go back to the other one."			  
29:34	I like this right here just for a simple fact of being able be able to easily view it on the phone.			  
29:45	And I'm looking at stuff probably being able to easily view it on the phone.			  
29:52	"But also like the other way because you can save it if you need to look at it later without, without having to get back into the to the VA app 'cause sometimes the VA app is not the fastest or logging on to the VA is not the fastest thing in the world."			  
30:09	But now that I can say I can save the the document and either print it or save it someplace for storage if need be.			  
30:21	OK.			  
30:21	"And when you say that you'd want to save it, would that be saving it on your phone or saving it on your your computer, either or either or?"			  
30:29	"OK, what might you prefer?"			  
30:33	"I would typically use my I have an iPad, so I would use the iPad."			  
30:40	"OK, great."			  
30:41	"And you mentioned printing, Do you sometimes print anything from your phone?"			  
30:48	"Yes, you do."			  
30:49	"OK, great."			  
30:51	"Thoughts on how you would prefer to interact with this kind of information And when I when I say how that could be on your phone like this, that could be this information on your computer that could be printing it out yeah."			  
31:06	Thoughts on how you would prefer to view everything in that is listed here.			  
31:11	"So typically phone or my tablet, OK, I don't get on a computer very often like you typically the phone or the tablet and yeah OK, got it."			  
31:26	"And then on a scale of one to five, how overwhelming or not does this feel to you that you're this view you're looking at getting a bit overwhelming just because this example or just a lot of debt going on or like this right here where it's giving you $15 little, little little pieces of payments and stuff."			  
31:59	"So it just, it's a lot for one screen."			  
32:01	"Yes, yeah."			  
32:06	"But it, it, it depends on how much, how much debt you may have."			  
32:11	"Or I might, I might have got it."			  
32:14	OK.			  
32:15	And then does a number come to mind for from 1:00 to 5:00 on the overwhelmed scale?			  
32:28	"Well, this one maybe two or three if if that much."			  
32:31	This is not terrible.			  
32:33	This right here is not terrible at all.			  
32:35	"Again, it's all going to depend on how many, how much debt or how many, how many co-pays or how many, how much little payments or, or."			  
32:55	"Just the number of transactions, this can get a little bit confusing on this page."			  
33:04	Sure.			  
33:04	"OK, got it."			  
33:05	"Maybe that's the best word of confusing it just it's just a lot of, lot of information on one page."			  
33:09	Yeah.			  
33:09	OK.			  
33:10	"So since you mentioned a lot of information on one page, like in this example, the one you have up right now, we chose to put in a full year of transactions."			  
33:20	"What are your thoughts on like maybe how, how far back you might want to see the information on on the transactions the the year, what the year is not bad."			  
33:35	"OK, sorry, sorry."			  
33:43	Let me think for a minute here.			  
33:58	Possibly my little bit more recognizable from from from civilian billing.			  
34:10	"If instead of having these these big blocks of of of a transaction N1 have having all this information in a big block, a simple date column, make a column date balance increase $15 and one or a \+ 15."			  
34:32	"Oh, oh, oh, to make to to make it a one line across, make it a one line across."			  
34:36	"So it's so you're so thinking about it, thinking about it, you're not scrolling through and scrolling and scrolling and scrolling to get down to your path, your back."			  
34:50	"OK, sorry, a SEC."			  
34:52	"So each, each each of these blocks could be a one liner thing."			  
34:56	"Mm, Hmm."			  
34:58	"OK, got it."			  
34:59	"As most in most cases the the phones, I don't like that here."			  
35:04	"In most cases I can't do it on this screen, but I would be able to if I wanted to be able to pinch and zoom on the website to to see the complete line or zoom in or out, if that makes sense."			  
35:21	"Yeah, Yep, totally."			  
35:23	OK.			  
35:25	"And maybe, sorry, maybe scroll back up."			  
35:29	I just want to look at the the PDF image one more time before we move on to something else.			  
35:34	Yeah.			  
35:35	So tap on the adapt.			  
35:35	There we go.			  
35:37	"So any now that we've looked at both versions, any further thought on how this PDF might be completely useful to something that you're to to you?"			  
35:52	"Yes, I like how I like how this is formatted OK, and been able to take this somewhat similar format and put it on the V as VA that Gov part of the side of the house making it somewhat similar would would would be a little to me a little bit easier to look at."			  
36:17	"OK, easier than than the list we were looking at correct got it OK, great."			  
36:23	"So I'm, I'm I'm a good example is if, if, if I had a a bunch of debt, had all this going on overpayments and then getting getting into chapter 35, if I had a bunch of debt going on and I just wanted to get to chapter 35 or, or particular there."			  
36:46	"If there's anything further down, it's a lot of scrolling to get to."			  
36:54	"OK, got it."			  
36:55	"Oh yeah, go ahead."			  
37:00	"If these if even if this was just the date and the amount, but but able to expand it."			  
37:13	So it's just a it's just a it's just a date and amount.			  
37:19	"And then if I wanted to see details, I can tap on it and give me details."			  
37:24	Got it.			  
37:24	"OK, yeah, that makes sense."			  
37:26	It's just a lot of it's just for like it is a lot of stuff on one page.			  
37:29	Mm hmm.			  
37:30	Just scroll through.			  
37:32	"Yeah, Let me have you tap on the blue home button at the bottom of the screen."			  
37:37	"OK, and I'm going to have you tap on the yellow future version a right there."			  
37:44	"OK, so we have so this is not existing anywhere."			  
37:49	These are potential designs we're testing out.			  
37:52	So I'd love to have you look around at this and let me know your thoughts.			  
37:57	"It is going to be the same again, same situation."			  
38:01	Yeah.			  
38:01	"So we're going to, we're pretending that you still have those same debts and still have the same co-pays."			  
38:44	Like this very much.			  
38:46	"OK, actually, let me have you tap into the the payments on the lower right, the very the small payments tab."			  
38:56	It's going to get you back to Yeah.			  
38:58	"And then in the middle of the screen where it says combined statement, I'm going to get you back there."			  
39:04	Perfect.			  
39:05	"OK, Yeah, yeah, there there's something it, it switched you to a different section."			  
39:11	So yeah.			  
39:12	"Thoughts on why I, I, I think you said you like you like this one."			  
39:17	What?			  
39:17	What what about it do you like again?			  
39:22	"Not, not nearly as cluttered."			  
39:25	"OK, not nearly as much information thrown at me and then I can have the ability to switch between the two being able to see the different breakdown between the Co payments and overpayments."			  
39:55	"OK, separate it out."			  
39:57	OK.			  
39:57	"And and is that what do you prefer the the separated out first, is there anything you do you do?"			  
40:01	OK.			  
40:01	"I do go ahead of the two, yes."			  
40:06	"OK, and let me have you Scroll down."			  
40:11	There is going to be a yellow box for version B.			  
40:15	"Yeah, there we go."			  
40:15	Click on that for a combined statement B.			  
40:18	Look around and see what differences you notice between this one and the previous one.			  
40:42	"All right, to think about it for a minute."			  
40:43	Our brain don't work that well.			  
40:44	"Sure, sure."			  
40:56	"Personally, I, I can't, my brain can't tell the difference."			  
41:00	Got it.			  
41:00	"OK, so let me Wow, wow."			  
41:02	"I, I could just, I'm talking to my brain to to figure out see the difference."			  
41:08	"Yeah, no, that's OK."			  
41:09	"Let me have you scroll up and I'll, I'll, I will point out the difference because it it it is small."			  
41:13	I do admit the main difference is so we see where the the box toward the bottom where it says co-pay bills right there.			  
41:22	Yeah.			  
41:22	So if you look at if actually if you scroll all the way down and go back to a statement as to version A with the yellow box.			  
41:31	Yep.			  
41:32	And so now that same box has the that that statement of you're receiving this billing statement.			  
41:39	That's that's the only difference between the versions.			  
41:46	Thoughts on what might be more useful?			  
41:52	Probably the BE.			  
41:57	"Then again, because personally I don't fall underneath that category where I have copays understanding it might be helpful for maybe somebody else, but most people realize what what the priority group they're in."			  
42:17	"OK, yeah."			  
42:17	And that they would have that they have co-pays and stuff.			  
42:23	So of the two probably that's 1B.			  
42:28	"OK, makes sense then."			  
42:31	OK.			  
42:32	And then I know one of the things that you had mentioned with the long list of combined statements is that you wanted to know details about individual transactions.			  
42:50	"Any any further thoughts looking at that this version, does it look any different to you?"			  
42:55	Would you want any further detail?			  
42:59	"Oh, sorry."			  
43:00	Tap on the the payments on the lower right.			  
43:05	Yeah.			  
43:05	And then tap on combined statement again.			  
43:07	I was looking at Sept.			  
43:08	I'm sorry.			  
43:09	"No, that's it."			  
43:10	"Yeah, you're good."			  
43:21	Yeah.			  
43:21	So like looking at like each of the the transactions for this co-pay bill.			  
43:27	Would you want to know any further information?			  
43:30	Is this enough?			  
43:31	What's your thought on the level of detail that's here?			  
43:45	"I'm thinking the ask for like the pharmacy stuff that, that that that OK, I can I can understand it."			  
43:57	"But either being able to the the possibility of, of linking to medical records so that, for example, outpatient care date on 1092025I can link back to, I can tap it, link back to that date of care and figure out what I was doing at the hospital that day."			  
44:28	"Especially for if I have a lot of, if I have a lot of medical appointments or if I'm elderly and have a caregiver or something, whatever."			  
44:51	"And they're trying to link this outpatient care date to what, what was I seen for that day?"			  
45:00	"What, where did this $20 come from?"			  
45:03	"OK, if it was able to link to medical health record, I don't know if it was able to link to medical health record and bring me up to the to my, to my provider note from that day, I can say, hey, I went to, I went and saw my primary care that day and it would."			  
45:24	"And that way if I had a dispute after the fact, I would know what I was."			  
45:31	"I would hopefully be a little bit prepared enough to know, Hey, this they they charged me for going to see this provider this day, but maybe maybe they should not have."			  
45:44	"OK, got so do you want you want and I would I would be I would be able to to get my my ducks in a row before I went back to that management or the VA or whatever and say, Hey, why are you charging me for this?"			  
45:58	MM Hmm.			  
45:59	"OK, got it."			  
46:00	"Let me have you tap on the payments on the lower right again, I'm going to get you back to another section and then tap where it says co-pay bills toward the top of this screen."			  
46:14	"So again, this is the same information."			  
46:16	"We're just, we're only looking at co-pay bills."			  
46:20	"Let's let's look at this, this top one, this Chalmers P Wiley veteran's outpatient clinic."			  
46:26	Tap into the the details of this and I I'd be curious to get your thoughts on how the information is presented here compared with the two tabs where you can switch back and forth of the other design and and we'll go back and forth so you can look at them.			  
46:55	But can I tap on these other?			  
46:57	"Oh yeah, recent."			  
46:58	"Yeah, OK."			  
46:59	Sure.			  
47:21	And this works.			  
47:22	I like this as well.			  
47:23	You like this as well.			  
47:24	"OK, well, what about this?"			  
47:25	"Do you like one be able to simply take care of it rather than have that management give me the option to go ahead and take care of it right here, right from home instead of having garnishment?"			  
47:44	Got it and seems simple enough to use.			  
47:52	"OK, got it."			  
47:53	"And then so again in this pretend, sorry pretend situation, you have both co-pays and you have overpayment benefit, overpayment debt."			  
48:05	Thoughts about viewing the two of them together?			  
48:10	"If you tap on the payments on the lower right again, I'll get you back to a section and then you would tap into overpayments on this screen like right in the yeah, right in the middle."			  
48:23	Thoughts on looking at the two of them together or maybe going back and forth?			  
48:32	"I would say I yeah, I do not mind either version of the of the A or B DNB would yeah, either one would work."			  
48:46	"Personally, I'd be able I wouldn't mind either one."			  
48:51	"OK, got it."			  
48:52	"So I, I go ahead thinking putting VADAV hat on."			  
49:01	"I don't know if you're looking for this as well, putting DAV hat on."			  
49:04	I know that there are quite a few veterans that are may not be technologically inclined that any of these current version feature versions or whatever of of how this is done is going to give them grief.			  
49:30	OK.			  
49:31	"And and to make it trying to help them, trying to make it as as simple to work through that's possible for them as well, especially if they're like I said, if they're not technologically inclined that we I know like my dad, he was he was retired."			  
49:54	He would probably throw his phone across the the the room.			  
50:00	"OK, yeah, with with the changes and understanding, understanding changes are going to happen."			  
50:06	But that's why I'm saying either to A or B work seem to work fairly well for me because they're they're fairly straightforward.			  
50:14	"OK, got it."			  
50:16	It's AI.			  
50:17	Just want to make sure that I'm understanding when you say ARB like 1 version being the two different tabs.			  
50:24	You can go back and forth as opposed to right here where you need to go to back up a page or two to get into each one of the of the two.			  
50:34	I like the what what was it a where you have the two tabs.			  
50:38	We could just select your your Co payments or overpayments and right there at the top of the thing you can choose whichever 1 you want to go looking into.			  
50:48	"Of the of the two versions, I I like that the mic I can work with that probably easier of the two."			  
50:59	"Got it, got it."			  
51:00	And would there be any instances where you would choose to do this route that you're looking at where you have an entire section of just the overpayments and then an entirely separate page of just the co-pays?			  
51:14	"Personally, if the VA was to choose one or the other, I I wouldn't mind work."			  
51:21	I would not have a problem working with either one.			  
51:27	It doesn't.			  
51:32	Neither one of them is like preferable or not preferable over the other.			  
51:36	That makes sense.			  
51:37	I can.			  
51:38	I can work.			  
51:38	I can work with them.			  
51:39	Got it.			  
51:40	Got it.			  
51:40	And how about the level of trust that you have with the information presented?			  
51:46	Any thoughts on if one version you might trust more than the other?			  
51:52	You're asking me if I trust the VA?			  
51:54	"No, I'm just joking."			  
51:56	"No, no, again, at least it's given depending on how much, depending on if the, if the system allowed, allowed me to, for example, go back and see what actually happened on October, whatever day it was, it's a outpatient visit."			  
52:18	"So I can go back and say I have the ability to go back and, and say, hey, this makes sense to me or I didn't go to the doctor that day or whatever 'cause then we, we all know the VA is never perfect."			  
52:37	"At least you have some place here where you can one look, look at these different transactions."			  
52:47	Got it.			  
52:48	OK.			  
52:48	"And hopefully get get more details and maybe if you had questions, you'd be able to to address them right off the app."			  
53:00	"OK, good."			  
53:02	"And then, so let's say we did have this version here where you've got separate pages entirely for overpay and separate pages for copay."			  
53:11	Any thoughts of if you did want to look at everything together like in that PDF of where you might expect to do that?			  
53:35	Can you ask that question again please?			  
53:36	"Yeah, of course."			  
53:37	"So considering the PDF statement that we had looked at earlier, let's say what you did have, the version that you're looking at here of overpay and co-pays were in separate pages."			  
53:51	Where might you hope or expect to find that PDF that did show everything in one page?			  
54:00	I would and I may not be following completely either review details maybe have an option.			  
54:14	"Sorry, may have an have any option to download APDF."			  
54:18	"I don't know if the transaction history would do that or not, but I don't know if you're asking me if like if I, if I wanted to have the combined a combined PDF of both the overpayment and the and the copay at once."			  
54:42	"Yeah, yeah."			  
54:42	"So I mean in general, like would would that be useful to you?"			  
54:49	"Useful, yes."			  
54:50	Maybe not necessary as long as you had like as long as at least here I can download a a a PDF of a a statement of my pension debt of a of a of a overpayment.			  
55:09	It can be separated though I wouldn't mind if I had to.			  
55:11	"If I had to get the overpayment PDF and then I had a separate co-pay to PDF, it wouldn't mind me."			  
55:18	It wouldn't bother me a bit.			  
55:20	"OK, got it, got it."			  
55:21	"Great, great."			  
55:22	"OK, we are at time."			  
55:25	So I'm going to wrap us up here and any any other final thoughts about financial management that you would like to share that you have?			  
55:34	"Not, not that I think of I've I've BTS running my BTS 3 running through my brain with some financial stuff on that in that area."			  
55:58	Got it.			  
55:58	But that's a that's a whole different topic and a whole different hour.			  
56:03	Got it.			  
56:03	"So we won't, we won't get into that."			  
56:05	"Then if there's if there's not, if there's not time."			  
56:08	"Well, I really appreciate you taking the time to talk with us."			  
56:11	This is super important for us to see just how veterans are like manage things and how you're looking at our tools.			  
56:19	So I do appreciate that and I hope that you have a great rest of your day this time.			  
56:27	Hope you have a good weekend.			  
56:27	"All right, thanks."			  
56:28	Take care.			  
56:29	Bye.
