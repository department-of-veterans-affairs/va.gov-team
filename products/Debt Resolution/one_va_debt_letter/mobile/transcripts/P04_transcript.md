## **Transcript: P04**

0:00	I'm going to ask the ask those again.					  
0:03	"So now that we are recording, are you OK with if I record the audio and visual today video today?"					  
0:10	"Yes, OK, great."					  
0:12	And are you OK if I potentially use any clips from this session to share with our VA partners?					  
0:17	"Yeah, that'd be fine."					  
0:18	Great.					  
0:19	Thank you.					  
0:20	So first I'd like to know at whatever level you are comfortable a little bit about yourself as a veteran.					  
0:26	Could be the branch you served when you retired or separated.					  
0:32	So I was in the \[redacted\] from 97 until 8O2.					  
0:38	"OK, got it."					  
0:39	And then what sort of interactions have you had with Veteran Affairs since then?					  
0:46	"Pretty good garden variety between healthcare, disability and compensation."					  
0:53	GI Bill as well.					  
0:56	I also have Ava home loan.					  
0:58	OK great.					  
1:01	And then how about any use of the VA website and the app?					  
1:07	"What, what's been your experience there?"					  
1:08	"Or what, what how how, how have you used either one?"					  
1:12	I've used both.					  
1:14	"As the app has improved, I've leaned more towards using the app than than using the site itself."					  
1:21	"OK, So what, what, what about the app do you like that is making you learn more toward that?"					  
1:29	"Just so First off with it not being, you know, I'm mostly using it on my phone."					  
1:36	"So not using a, a browser on my phone as opposed to an app to where it's just visually better and easier to navigate."					  
1:44	"Plus, I mean, I know you can do it with a browser too, but with the app, it's got my Biogen or bio biometrics saved in it."					  
1:53	"So it's, I don't have to, I mean, I remember the passwords and I have them saved, but I don't have to type them in or anything else like that, you know, So it's just, you know, you open the app and it looks at your face and you're in and you're in."					  
2:09	There you go.					  
2:10	"And what's, what sort of things are you doing in the app?"					  
2:17	So let me just open it real quick and I will kind of go through that.					  
2:23	"So the biggest thing I would say is probably pharmacy and you know, keeping like it's easier now than it used to be to see your what's ready to refill and everything else and to do those."					  
2:37	"So, so that part's probably like the, the biggest use that I get out of it."					  
2:46	"And then it's nice with the appointments where I can just screenshot that and then send it to, you know, like my supervisor, like, hey, I'm going to be out this day because I'm having, you know, get this appointment or that appointment."					  
2:58	"Or I get, I get \[redacted\] a year."					  
3:03	"And depending on how those go, like I've got to the point where I usually just, I plan to be off at least the rest of that day."					  
3:11	"So depending on what time I schedule them, you know, hey, I'm going to have to leave about an hour before this appointment and I won't be returning and you know that."					  
3:21	"And so it's, it's easy just to to take a quick screenshot, screenshot of that and then just e-mail it or text it."					  
3:28	"OK, good."					  
3:29	"Yeah, sounds convenient."					  
3:32	"OK, so we're going to move into the financial portion and I want to make sure that you're only sharing what you are comfortable sharing."					  
3:39	"Like I said, I don't have any access into your records, any sort of finances with the VA."					  
3:44	"So I know on on your Screener you you had selected that you either currently or previously have had unpaid benefits, overpayment debts 1."					  
3:55	If you could tell me at whatever level you're comfortable a little bit about that.					  
4:01	"Yeah, they had initially I think when I went from \[disability %\], there was a little bit of an over payment on that one."					  
4:12	So there was that.					  
4:13	"And then in the reverse overpayment, I'm still in the process trying to get this one rectified."					  
4:17	But in May I went from \[disability %\] and they backdated it to May of 2023\.					  
4:26	So I'm still in the process of trying to get the co-pays that I did have refunded.					  
4:32	So an overpayment by what I overpaid.					  
4:36	OK.					  
4:37	So is that just for the co-pays or for any other benefit payments?					  
4:43	"So that's just yeah, prescription co-pays."					  
4:46	Yeah.					  
4:46	"Because I mean, I don't know what your level of awareness is, but once you go over 50, you don't pay co-pays for any medicine."					  
4:55	"OK, Yeah."					  
4:56	"I, I knew, I didn't know exactly what the number was, but I knew that."					  
4:59	Yeah.					  
4:59	"But that when that went through, that changed my status as far as that goes."					  
5:05	"OK, got it."					  
5:05	"And so I was working on getting well, I'm still working on getting the what I did pay refunded."					  
5:13	"OK, got it."					  
5:15	"OK, so when so it sounds like so now you're not paying any co-pays."					  
5:18	Is that is that right as of May?					  
5:20	"Yeah, OK, got it."					  
5:21	"OK, so then when you were paying co-pays, how were you notified whenever you did get a co-pay bill?"					  
5:31	Usually be a letter in the mail.					  
5:32	OK.					  
5:34	And often times I just let it sit until it just came out of one of my BHX.					  
5:41	"Oh, got it."					  
5:42	OK.					  
5:43	Yeah.					  
5:43	"Which meant I paid some interest on it, but OK."					  
5:47	Yeah.					  
5:47	Yeah.					  
5:48	"For these bills, did you always know they were coming or were any ever a surprise?"					  
5:53	No.					  
5:53	"They always mailed a letter in advance, 00 and yeah."					  
5:58	And they would tell you what month the the bill would be deducted from the benefits.					  
6:05	"OK, got it."					  
6:06	"And was that so the the bill being deducted from the benefits, was that an option you had to choose or was that automatic?"					  
6:13	How did that process go?					  
6:15	"That was the like if you did nothing often, basically."					  
6:20	Yeah.					  
6:20	"Like if you didn't take any action to take care of it, it wouldn't take care of itself that way."					  
6:25	"Oh, OK."					  
6:25	Got it.					  
6:26	So when you first learned just about any Co base in general.					  
6:31	"So you said that like that process happened if you didn't do anything, were you aware of the options into in terms of next steps for the co-pay bills when they first arrived?"					  
6:43	"Yeah, Yeah."					  
6:44	"I mean, I knew that I could go and pay the Gov or whatever it is and pay it there."					  
6:48	Yeah.					  
6:48	OK.					  
6:49	"And what's talking about any other communication you received regarding these bills, if at all?"					  
6:56	"I mean, that's the most of it that I remember."					  
7:00	"I mean, yeah, you would get statements and it would say, and then what if it drug out too long?"					  
7:05	"Then they would send you that, you know, hey, there's going to be a deduction or reduction based out of your benefits based upon the amount you owed."					  
7:15	"I also though too, for years, you know, nobody's, nobody can be perfect."					  
7:21	My primary care's biggest thing was that she was not ever coding my service connected medicine as being service connected.					  
7:30	"Oh, wow."					  
7:31	"So every couple, like every about 3 or 4 times a year, I would have to call in and ask for a review so that they could change the the coding and make it reflect what it was supposed to be."					  
7:44	"Oh, got it."					  
7:45	OK.					  
7:46	"Yeah, I see."					  
7:47	"But I mean, that's that's a provider issue, you know, and that's just as I've had this primary here."					  
7:54	Got it.					  
7:55	"OK and then, OK, so you said you received letters and then was there anything, did you ever log into your account to see anything regarding these co-pays or any bills?"					  
8:10	"Usually I just looked at the statements, just statements."					  
8:12	"OK, yeah, 'cause what I would do is before I called in, I would highlight off the ones that were service connected so that when I was speaking to the representative, I had it right in front of me along with the item number on the bill and everything else."					  
8:29	"OK, so just just being prepared going into the call."					  
8:32	So.					  
8:33	"OK, got it."					  
8:34	"And had you ever, I know you said you, you, you used the physical statement."					  
8:38	"Had you ever come across any of those statements within, within the website or the app?"					  
8:45	"Yeah, I saw where they were, but I rarely ever went there and looked."					  
8:51	Got it.					  
8:52	OK.					  
8:52	"Any, any other reason that you, you chose not to look at them online, that you, that you preferred the physical statements?"					  
9:01	It's probably just laziness.					  
9:03	Like I knew that it would come to me.					  
9:05	"And so just, yeah, take care of it when it gets here."					  
9:09	"OK, good."					  
9:11	"So I'd like to ask about like, overall managing of finances."					  
9:17	And so managing amusing is a fairly broad term.					  
9:19	"It could be like making phone calls to VA or maybe talking to your provider or sitting down down to like pay any, any other bills you might have or just any sort of money management."					  
9:31	"And I'm curious when you do that, when I say when, that could be like certain days of the month or a certain day of the week or maybe only when you're at home or something along those lines."					  
9:43	"So yeah, I'd love to know about like when you do an any sort of financial management."					  
9:50	"I mean, so at work I generally don't do any calls or anything like that, but there are times I definitely have, you know, figured out my budget while I was at work."					  
10:03	"But I work as an, \[redacted\] so obviously I'm not calling anybody because they're going to get put on hold if someone else calls in."					  
10:10	"So, you know, I just say that for when I'm off work."					  
10:16	"So yeah, they call."					  
10:17	Any kind of calls or anything like that would be outside of work hours.					  
10:21	"I figure the budget, you know, both on and off work hours, just depending."					  
10:26	"And then, I mean, if it's an e-mail, yeah, I would reply to an e-mail even while working, but that's just kind of one of those like this doesn't interfere with my job."					  
10:40	"So in the downtown between calls, one of the things I might do."					  
10:44	"OK, good."					  
10:45	"And what sort of method do you have just for for managing finances overall, keeping track of budget or making sure that you're paying anything that you need to pay?"					  
10:56	Yeah.					  
10:57	"So I mean, I have a Excel spreadsheet that I've made my own formulas for and everything else and use it to manage a couple different accounts."					  
11:07	"And you know, I have one, that one all my direct deposits go into where I transfer money over to that one for bills to come out of."					  
11:20	"And like that card, I don't even carry the card to that."					  
11:23	I called my bills account.					  
11:24	So I don't even carry that card on a daily basis because I don't use that that account for anything besides paying bills.					  
11:31	Got it.					  
11:32	OK.					  
11:33	And then how about any timeline throughout either month or year in terms of making sure money's in the right place or making sure the bills are being taken care of?					  
11:43	That's usually I'm like going around once a two week time period every two week.					  
11:47	OK.					  
11:48	Yeah.					  
11:49	"So you know, along with my regular paydays and then wherever my BA check falls like kind of calculated into there too as well."					  
11:56	"And then you know, with the next payday then I'll, I'll update it again."					  
12:02	"OK, got it."					  
12:03	"So sounds like it's, it's, it's based around when when you're receiving payments and in terms of what you're managing."					  
12:09	Yeah.					  
12:11	"OK, great."					  
12:14	"And is there, are you finding that there's anything challenging or confusing when keeping track of money going in and out for, for how you're managing things?"					  
12:27	Not really.					  
12:27	"I mean, I've, I've kind of got it down."					  
12:30	I've shared that spreadsheet with actually like in a mentoring way with younger coworkers to help them too.					  
12:37	"So yeah, I've got a blank version that I can give out at any moment."					  
12:42	Good to help folks with that.					  
12:43	Excellent.					  
12:45	"OK, so we're going to move into some prototypes now and let me have you share your screen and then we'll look to get Figma open and then I'll send you a link."					  
13:29	And just so you know that here pretty soon I'm going to have to run and grab something off the porch for my wife.					  
13:34	"Oh sure, no problem."					  
14:11	"I'm not seeing anything in mind yet, so let me know if you need any help walking through screen sharing."					  
14:16	Give me one second.					  
14:22	I'm logging into Figma now.					  
14:26	"Oh, I've got a test account so we don't want to do that."					  
14:29	"But yeah, if you want to share, OK."					  
14:56	"All right, great."					  
14:57	Screen is sharing.					  
14:58	Beautiful.					  
14:59	So did do you already have an account with Pigma?					  
15:01	Did you log in already?					  
15:02	It's fine if you did.					  
15:04	"I would, yeah."					  
15:07	So I am going to go ahead and send you a link.					  
15:12	"All right, just sent it in the zoom chat."					  
15:16	If you want to switch back to Zoom and grab.					  
15:18	Yeah.					  
15:18	There we go Emily to meeting Yep.					  
15:24	Tap once on that and it should open in the app.					  
15:28	Sometimes it takes a moment.					  
15:30	Great.					  
15:30	And you can swipe my my video image off to the side just so you've got more space.					  
15:35	"Oh, that came up nice and fast."					  
15:37	I love when things work.					  
15:38	"All right, so in this situation, we're go actually back up."					  
15:44	"So I, I just said you you you haven't had experience with any sort of overpayments outside of of medical are are you are are you aware of what benefit overpayments are in general?"					  
16:00	"I mean, I believe so yeah, it looks like here yeah, you can kind of see the the different versions."					  
16:11	Yeah.					  
16:11	"So in this, let me have you go back to home, actually tap the home at the bottom."					  
16:15	"OK, great."					  
16:16	"Yeah, I mean, in general, it's it's when it's it's usually outside of of medical."					  
16:22	"But when, when VA sends more money to the veteran than they are entitled to at that moment, because it's it's very often tied to let's say if they receive money for education and then have to drop a class for what whatever reason they would need to pay that money back."					  
16:37	Or if there's something with the dependents that the dependents didn't get updated and then therefore they received more money than they were entitled to at the moment.					  
16:48	So it's usually records with VA are not quite updated to to real time where the veteran then has to then incurs a debt and has to pay back these overpayments.					  
16:59	That's what that's what we mean when for the overpayments.					  
17:03	"So in this pretend situation, we're going to say that you have a few benefit overpayments from both some disability and education benefits plus some co-pays for a few routine medical appointments and some prescriptions."					  
17:20	"So knowing that in this pretend situation you do have both, what are your initial thoughts for when you might want to look at just the co-pays or just the benefit overpayments as opposed to seeing everything together?"					  
17:37	I think I like it available every time because I like to be able to itemize what what each portion is and understand each charge.					  
17:45	"So if it was combined and it just it didn't break everything down, Yeah, that version would not be good to me."					  
17:54	"Oh, it did."					  
17:54	OK.					  
17:54	OK.					  
17:55	"You said you you you want to make sure that you're, you're seeing all the details of everything."					  
17:59	Yeah.					  
18:00	"And, and no matter what the version was, yeah, I would absolutely want to see, be able to see a breakdown of every item."					  
18:07	"OK, got it."					  
18:08	So let me have you tap on the combined statement so you can scroll around here.					  
18:14	"And so again, this is pretending that you've got you go to two different locations for your medical care and then also have 3 debts from benefit overpayments."					  
18:46	"OK, Now I have a pretty good idea of it."					  
18:48	"OK, so thoughts on the information presented here, how helpful or not helpful or useful it might be for how you might want to manage finances."					  
19:01	So I think when you initially see it.					  
19:04	So let me get back to the top of this part.					  
19:07	"So this this opening charges portion, I think I would probably initially rather see the total amounts and then have like a drop down option."					  
19:21	"That way if like if in this section, I was pretty well aware and didn't have any concerns that anything was off, I could faster Scroll down to let's say the this portion of the GI Bill."					  
19:34	OK?					  
19:35	So you'd want to be able to quickly get from one to another.					  
19:37	"Yeah, got it."					  
19:39	OK.					  
19:45	And any other thoughts on how the information here is presented?					  
19:52	"Yeah, just having that drop down I think would probably be the the best."					  
19:58	And then so this section I'm looking at now having maybe basically like an overall summary.					  
20:13	"OK, like maybe right above the download combined statement that would probably be like visually be better for me."					  
20:22	"OK, you want to see everything you once."					  
20:23	Got it.					  
20:24	"OK yeah, yeah, I like I like to see able to see a summarized version, but then also like if I want to dig into the details, I want to be able to have that option too."					  
20:34	Got it.					  
20:34	"OK, great."					  
20:35	And then then on and I said a drop down.					  
20:38	"I really should have said an expansion because I don't want to see it in a scrolling format of, you know, pick one."					  
20:45	"Oh, yeah."					  
20:46	"Not like the drop down box, but yeah, Yep."					  
20:48	"I for some reason, even though you said drop down, I did actually picture in my mind an accordion."					  
20:53	So we're all good.					  
20:56	"OK, so on On a scale of one to five, how overwhelming or not does this page feel to you?"					  
21:04	"I mean, probably a six just because you automatically have to go through each and everyone, every little incidents and and change."					  
21:17	Got it.					  
21:17	"OK, yeah, that part I don't care for as much."					  
21:21	Not until it's something like I feel like I need to dig into it.					  
21:26	"OK, got it."					  
21:28	"And would there be any, what sort of actions or decisions do you think you might want to make when viewing this information here altogether?"					  
21:41	"I mean, basically I'd be like, I've had the summary portion at the top."					  
21:48	"I could probably use that to, you know, add that into my budget and breakdown like, OK, well, how much can I pay, you know, this time period and how much can I pay the next?"					  
21:59	"Another thing too, is that I would say that would probably be more helpful."					  
22:05	"So the billion reference, if it started out with like, you know, let's say it was October 2025 and then the building reference, that would tell me like, OK, it's the statement for October of 2025 because we're looking at the building reference number."					  
22:22	That means nothing to me.					  
22:24	"I mean, that's just a bunch of letters and numbers that if there's a format to it, I don't, I can't immediately see and understand it."					  
22:35	OK.					  
22:35	"You know, like if it started with like O32 instead of J32, OK, maybe that indicates October."					  
22:41	"Yeah, Yeah."					  
22:41	OK.					  
22:42	Yeah.					  
22:42	But the rest of it's not useful as far as anything that I would use it for unless it was talking over the phone with someone.					  
22:50	"And they're like, OK, it's this reference, this bill, and they give me that."					  
22:54	But it'd be simpler if there was just like billing month for October of the year.					  
23:00	Yeah.					  
23:01	OK.					  
23:01	"So that's just extraneous information, the billing reference really only until you're actually talking with someone who could help with your account."					  
23:09	Yeah.					  
23:10	"And even then, I think it would be better for all parties involved if it was statement for October, Yeah, or whatever the month was."					  
23:20	"OK, that makes sense."					  
23:22	And thoughts on how you would prefer to interact with this information?					  
23:26	And when I say how that's more like in what format would you want to look at it on your phone like this?					  
23:33	Would you want APDF on your computer?					  
23:36	Would you want to print APDF?					  
23:37	Would you want it in your e-mail?					  
23:39	Any or or anything else you can think of?					  
23:44	"I mean, I overall like, like I said, if we had the decorating versus all of it, just you have to review each one and scroll past it."					  
23:54	"If that if that part was resolved, I would say that and then like for me APDF download link between those two, that would be sufficient for how I would look at things."					  
24:06	"OK And since you mentioned the PDF download link, what would you be doing with that download specifically?"					  
24:16	"I either I might save it so that I can look at it at a later time or if I felt like I needed to print it out and make notes like in my, you know, now it it's kind of it's a moot point."					  
24:31	"But when I did have to pay co-pays for other things, you know, I liked being able to have a physical copy in front of me and you know, highlighted the ones that I needed to discuss, make notes out to the side and things like that."					  
24:45	"So that way it's kind of like, you know, I've got I've got kind of an outline as I'm having the conversation over the phone."					  
24:53	"OK, got it."					  
24:55	"And from this page, would it be clear of where you might find APDF?"					  
25:02	"Yeah, this combined statement."					  
25:04	"OK, great."					  
25:05	Let me have you tap on that and just see if that is what you expect from seeing the description.					  
25:14	"I mean, aside from the fact that I can't zoom in right now."					  
25:17	So if you.					  
25:18	"So, yeah, the zooming is a weird thing on Figma, if you tap once, we've made a little artificial zoom."					  
25:23	Yeah.					  
25:23	"So in in real life, you of course could pinch and zoom, but yeah, our, our, our pretend zoom, if you will."					  
25:37	Yeah.					  
25:37	Now that format seems seems sufficient.					  
25:40	OK.					  
25:41	And are you ever viewing PDFs like this on your phone?					  
25:46	"Yeah, absolutely you are."					  
25:47	"OK, got it."					  
25:49	All right.					  
25:51	"And any other thoughts on or actually back up thoughts on this, this format right here with the long list versus the the PDF format?"					  
26:06	"And I said you would, you would print out APDF often if talking on the phone, other differences of when you might use one or the other or if one is generally more useful than the other."					  
26:19	"No, I could see good reasons for both, honestly."					  
26:23	"So I wouldn't write 1, you know, above the other one."					  
26:27	"OK, got it."					  
26:29	And you mentioned saving PDFs.					  
26:31	Do you?					  
26:32	Would that be something you'd be doing on your phone also?					  
26:35	"Yeah, got it."					  
26:36	OK.					  
26:36	"Yeah, generally speaking."					  
26:37	"OK, great."					  
26:39	I'm gonna have you tap in the done on the top there.					  
26:43	Tap home at the bottom.					  
26:46	"OK, so now let me have you look at go into the overpayments."					  
26:51	So we're going to be looking at only the overpayments to get a sense of just how things are laid out differently than than the combined statement.					  
27:00	So because this is all going to be the same information.					  
27:01	"And again, this is the same pretend scenario of having three debts from benefit overpayments, same numbers and everything, but just a different way of of laying out thoughts on when, if you prefer one or the other or when you might choose to look to view things in this view as opposed to the combined statement list from before."					  
27:26	"This is definitely a lot more visually appealing and just seems kind of more user friendly because I have the option to hit review details as opposed to yeah, yeah."					  
27:40	"And then I can, you know, look at this portion, I guess read the letter if I need."					  
27:46	I mean a property.					  
27:48	"No, but yeah."					  
27:50	"Yeah, this one is this is more in line with kind of what I think I prefer."					  
27:56	"OK, I got it."					  
27:57	And maybe get back to that main page also to get back to the Co.					  
28:04	"Sorry to go into the co-pays as well, just to see how you'd get from one to the other figure."					  
28:10	Yeah.					  
28:10	There we go.					  
28:10	You got it.					  
28:12	Yeah.					  
28:13	"So thoughts on, let's say you do have you, you are looking to look at both your co-pays and your benefit overpayments in the same session, if you will, thoughts on the process of of of going back and switching from one section to the other?"					  
28:30	That's not a big deal.					  
28:31	"And I honestly kind of like them separated because oh, you do OK."					  
28:34	"Yeah, until there are two primary categories."					  
28:37	OK.					  
28:37	"Can you say more about that, about why you like the separation?"					  
28:42	"I mean, it's just, I guess it's probably just like the way that my brain likes to compartmentalize things and ship things from 1 to the one to the next."					  
28:52	"You know, like 1 is straight up just a bill, and then one is an error in my favor of that turned out to not be in my favor, you know, however you want to say it."					  
29:03	"Yeah, Yeah, Yeah."					  
29:05	"So yeah, I just because I feel like, you know, the co-pays have due dates, where's the overpayments?"					  
29:14	There's probably the option for like a payment plan or whatever else.					  
29:19	"You know, that's something that you could have a set amount, you know, scheduled for on a on a regular basis."					  
29:26	"Whereas the co-pays are going to come and go as you know, you get more, more reasons for co-pay."					  
29:34	"OK, got it."					  
29:35	"So then, oh, go ahead."					  
29:36	I just like which I don't have to worry about anymore.					  
29:39	"Yeah, got it."					  
29:40	OK.					  
29:41	"So then so acknowledging that you just said you like you like them separated, would there be any time that you might want to look at the combined statement and either that that longer list or the PDF?"					  
29:56	"Only if I knew that there were errors that I needed to discuss, like line item by line item and and do that way."					  
30:04	But that's the only situation where I've ever felt any kind of need to do anything like that.					  
30:11	"OK, OK, so let me have you go into tap where it says future version B and we're going to get a different view."					  
30:19	So this is a a combined statement.					  
30:21	"And I know you acknowledging that you said you do like to see them separately, but look around here and let me know."					  
30:28	"Again, same exact number, same information, a different way of formatting things here or of of displaying things."					  
30:49	"Aside from this one being panicky about closing back up, yeah, that's usually a prototype issue."					  
30:54	"Yeah, I figured that works."					  
30:56	That happens.					  
31:00	"Yeah, I I would say I overall I like this one better than the the the other previous one that we looked at where it was you were forced to look at every line item."					  
31:11	"OK, so, OK, so I, I, I know city like the the expanding and collapsing of accordions to see only what you're looking, want to look at."					  
31:21	Are there are there reasons that you that you like this method better than the longer list?					  
31:29	"Yeah, I feel like that's just quicker and easier for me to just see the overall amounts."					  
31:37	"And then if I feel like I need to look into it, I've got the option to look at it with that being forced to go through and scroll through all the other ones just to get to the the next section."					  
31:50	"Yeah, like the and here I like the the two buttons, you know the switch back and forth so quickly and easily."					  
31:56	"OK, you like that?"					  
31:58	How about the the option here of switching back and forth between the co-pays and the overpayments tabs versus the other experience where it was 2 totally different sections to get to the co-pays and then get to the overpayments.					  
32:11	Is 1 easier than the other?					  
32:13	Is you prefer this is easier one?					  
32:15	"Yeah, is easier."					  
32:15	"OK, Yeah, I definitely prefer this one currently."					  
32:20	OK got it.					  
32:21	"And how about looking at thinking of of all the ways that we've now looked at the way that your information is displaying, is there any that that stick out to you as being any more or less trustworthy to you?"					  
32:40	"No, I mean, it's the same information, it's just displayed differently."					  
32:47	It's just that I would say like this current one is the one that best fits my preferences and the way I like to see things.					  
32:58	"So OK, got it."					  
33:00	"And so if you so let's say you, you had this version with the two different tabs."					  
33:05	"So going back and forth from Co paste overpayments have and then would would would you still want access to the combined, sorry, the suit to the PDF statement, which with everything together previous to going over 50%, I would say it was something I would require at this point, not as much, but it's just because I don't have co-pays to pay anymore."					  
33:34	Got it.					  
33:34	OK.					  
33:35	"And it's oh, we got go ahead."					  
33:37	"And, and you know, like I said, that being the difference, just the fact that now I don't have to worry about paying any of those or having a payment, you know, having a payment come out of my, yeah, my check."					  
33:50	"I don't, I don't have the need for it in the way I did before."					  
33:54	Mm hmm.					  
33:55	"OK, got it."					  
33:56	"And so thinking of of the PDFs that I said that like a primary reason would be printing them out and having that, that record for if you have to call and you've got everything in front of you."					  
34:08	"If you had PDFs available for like just the co-pays or just the overpayments separately, would you still want a separate PDF that shows everything together?"					  
34:21	So it lays out your entire financial obligation for to to the VA?					  
34:25	"I mean, either combination would be able to work for me, either one."					  
34:31	"OK, yeah, OK, got it."					  
34:37	And going over my notes here.					  
34:46	"I think, Oh yeah, that's one thing I forgot to."					  
34:49	"OK, OK, we are in the Scroll down to the bottom of this page."					  
34:56	There's one I forgot to get you to.					  
34:57	"All right, tap on a combined statement A right there."					  
35:02	"OK, tell me if you like what you notice about the difference between A\&B and if you want you can switch back and forth."					  
35:11	"It's at the that yellow button at the very bottom, if you'd like to see what the difference is."					  
35:34	"I mean, it looks to be just font size differences, and that's one thing I kind of really notice."					  
35:42	"OK, excuse me."					  
35:45	"So there, I'll, I'll tell you the, the, really the, the primary difference is on the in the middle of the screen where it says you're receiving this billing statement because on version A, which is what you're looking at, it's always there."					  
35:58	"And if you Scroll down to version B, it's actually in it's it's yeah."					  
36:04	On this right there.					  
36:05	Yeah.					  
36:05	Yeah.					  
36:07	Thoughts on that?					  
36:07	Would that be important to you?					  
36:09	Do you prefer one over the other?					  
36:13	"Unimportant, but I do prefer B."					  
36:16	You you've heard this one here.					  
36:18	"OK, got it."					  
36:20	Thought.					  
36:20	Can you say more about that?					  
36:21	Why you prefer this one?					  
36:23	It just removes some unnecessary stuff that I don't particularly need to do.					  
36:29	"OK, got it."					  
36:31	"And how about any thoughts of like if you, if you were to design this to your specifications, other things that would be important to you to make this a useful tool for you?"					  
36:51	"I guess maybe so for the situation not previously and maybe to where there was something that would indicate if I left them paid, this will come out of your benefits check for next month."					  
37:05	"You know, that way you kind of could know that ahead of time because sometimes you know, the letter would say one thing but then something else might mature to that in between that time period and more would come out than what I expected."					  
37:22	"So yeah, just something indicated that if not paid by this day, it will be deducted from month whatever benefits."					  
37:34	"OK, makes sense."					  
37:37	"And I had one other question and what was I going to ask you now that OK, I am blacking and what else was going to ask you?"					  
37:53	"So let me check in with my team if anybody would like to ask questions, you're welcome to unmute and ask them now."					  
38:13	OK.					  
38:13	Looks like no.					  
38:15	"So anything else to add regarding any sort of financial management or anything with, with finances directly with VA?"					  
38:30	Not that I can particularly think of right now.					  
38:33	"OK, great."					  
38:35	"Well, this has been super helpful."					  
38:36	I appreciate you coming in early.					  
38:38	"Thank you for to, to chat with us."					  
38:41	"It's so it's, it's so important for us to be talking with veterans."					  
38:44	I really appreciate you sharing your experiences.					  
38:46	"It's yeah, it's, it's really helpful."					  
38:48	"It's, we work to improve all of the tools and hopefully make things better for everyone to be able to, you know, manage your finances and everything and make things easier."					  
38:58	So thank you so much and I hope you have a great rest of your day.					  
39:04	I guess I did have one question that's unrelated to the actual session stuff.					  
39:11	What was the timeline for and what was the amount of compensation?					  
39:15	"I just want, I can't remember exactly what it said."					  
39:18	"Well, sorry I, I, I missed the question."					  
39:21	What was the timeline and amount of compensation?					  
39:26	"Oh, from Perigian."					  
39:27	"I actually do not know they Yeah, they're actually a different a different company."					  
39:32	So we I that is a great question.					  
39:36	"I do not have the answer correctly, but I know they're I gotta remember the amount, but I just timeline was the one that I couldn't remember as much."					  
39:42	So that's a good I should actually find that out because I don't actually know the answer to that and be ready with that answer for future people.					  
39:48	So I'm glad to hear you might get asked that one.					  
39:51	"Yeah, I know."					  
39:52	"Yeah, it's very true."					  
39:52	Yeah.					  
39:54	All right.					  
39:54	"Well, thank you."					  
39:55	I hope you ever get rest of your day.					  
39:56	You guys too.					  
39:57	Thank you.					  
39:57	"OK, thanks."					  
39:58	Take care.
