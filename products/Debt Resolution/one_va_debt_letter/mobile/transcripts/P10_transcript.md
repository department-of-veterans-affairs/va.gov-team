## **Transcript: P10**

0:00	OK.  
0:02	OK.  
0:02	"So now that we are recording, are you OK if I record the screen and audio as we talked today?"  
0:08	Yes.  
0:09	OK.  
0:09	And are you OK if I potentially share any clips from this session with our VA partners?  
0:15	Yes.  
0:16	"OK, great."  
0:16	Thank you.  
0:18	"So first, I'd love to know from you at whatever level you are comfortable a little bit about yourself as a veteran could be what branch you served in when you retired or separated?"  
0:31	I served in the \[redacted\] and I separated in 1978\.  
0:36	"OK, great."  
0:38	And then what sort of interactions have you had with Veteran Affairs over the years since then?  
0:47	I guess it's been about 10 years now that I have been and the VA system medically wise that's my only form of of medical.  
1:04	I don't have any outside insurance so I'm in constant weekly contact with the VA.  
1:13	OK got it.  
1:14	"And how about any, any experience you have looking or sorry, using the VA website or the mobile app all the time, all the time."  
1:24	All right.  
1:26	What are you using overall?  
1:28	What are you using for?  
1:31	I'm not necessarily using the mobile app.  
1:33	I use my healthy bet to communicate with my providers.  
1:41	"OK, and are you so so do you have the the the I guess regular, if you will, VM mobile app or you just use my healthy vet?"  
1:49	"I just use my healthy vet vet, but I use apps all the time."  
1:54	"Oh, you do."  
1:54	OK.  
1:55	So it may be easier to use the app.  
1:58	I'm not sure.  
1:59	Mm hmm.  
1:59	"OK, got it."  
2:00	"And the my healthy event, is that an app or is that also a website Website."  
2:05	It's a website.  
2:06	Got it.  
2:07	All right.  
2:08	"And so what's on the the VA website, what sorts of things are you are are you are you doing within the site mostly communicating with my providers as far as appointments, doctor visits, etcetera."  
2:24	"OK, got it."  
2:25	And are you when?  
2:27	"So when you said you are on the Myhealthy vet the website, are you using the website on a desktop computer, on a mobile phone, mobile phone, mobile phone."  
2:36	"OK, got it."  
2:38	Do you also are you are you also ever using it on the desktop computer?  
2:43	I don't have a desktop.  
2:45	"I have a laptop, but I don't use the laptop unless it's absolutely necessary."  
2:51	It's always my phone.  
2:53	"Oh, got it, got it."  
2:54	"Can you see more about that, about why you prefer the phone over the laptop?"  
2:58	It seems to be just more convenient and always in my hand.  
3:02	"Ah, got it."  
3:02	"OK, some more proximity in in that case, it sounds like."  
3:06	Got it.  
3:07	"OK, great."  
3:09	"All right, so we are we're going to move to the financial portion of the discussion."  
3:17	So I want to make sure you're only sharing what he is comfortable for you.  
3:21	"I like I said, I don't have any insights, no additional information about you or your finances."  
3:27	"OK, so since you mentioned that you that you have healthcare, what are are you currently receiving any co-pays from the healthcare?"  
3:37	"No, you don't."  
3:38	OK And have you in the past had had medical co-pays?  
3:42	"Yes, I have."  
3:43	OK.  
3:44	Do you do you recall a time frame of when when you had those most recently?  
3:50	I filed A hardship claim.  
3:53	So it's probably been four or five months.  
3:57	Got it.  
3:57	"OK, so so fairly recently it's yes."  
4:00	"OK, got it."  
4:01	"And how so from that point and then earlier, how were you learning about any co-pay bills that you had the mail, the mail, OK."  
4:13	And then did you always know that those were coming or were any of them ever a surprise?  
4:20	I always knew they were coming.  
4:22	"OK, got it."  
4:23	And how about the clarity about what they were for?  
4:26	Was that always clear?  
4:27	"Yes, got it."  
4:28	OK.  
4:29	"And how about any sort of next steps you have to take or options, how was the clarity on that when you received the bills?"  
4:40	"I mean when I was paying the co-pays, I just did it through my banking and a bill pay."  
4:50	So that's how I was taking care of that.  
4:54	OK.  
4:56	"In the end, you had mentioned that you had filed for a hardship."  
5:01	Was that that option?  
5:03	Was that clear to you or how how did how did you first learn that that was an option?  
5:07	"Well, I've known it was an option."  
5:09	I've used it in the past when I was in \[redacted\]  
5:13	"But I did that through the actually on site at the \[redacted\]. Oh, OK, got it."  
5:23	And when you say on site was someone helping you like on the website or what?  
5:29	What did what did that look like?  
5:30	"No, I mean it was in person."  
5:32	Got it.  
5:32	"OK, so they were records, I guess."  
5:35	"OK, so they were they were filing anything needed for you."  
5:39	OK.  
5:41	And then how about any experience you have with benefit over payment debt?  
5:49	I'm not sure what you mean by that.  
5:51	"So the like one example, like let's say people have used benefits for education and they receive the money for some classes that they're that they're taking and then they drop a class or something else happens after the they've already received that money."  
6:11	And then therefore they need to pay that back.  
6:13	And so that can happen with a variety of of benefit payments where the VA is has really sent more money to the veteran than they are entitled to at that moment.  
6:25	And so therefore they need to pay it back.  
6:27	I've never had a situation where I had to pay any money back.  
6:31	It's just been billing for healthcare.  
6:34	"OK, just healthcare."  
6:35	"OK, got it."  
6:37	"So now I'd like to ask you about times that you're actively managing really any sort of bills, any, any, you know, any sort of banking or credit card utilities overall."  
6:51	"Can you talk to me about when you do that and by by when it could be like certain times of the month or prompted by things or like if you're always, let's say at home or something like that."  
7:05	Talk to me about when you are managing your finances.  
7:08	"Well, I'm, I am retired."  
7:12	I only work part time at will and I get Social Security.  
7:19	So my banking is set up to coincide with my Social Security checks.  
7:26	So I do all my banking online.  
7:29	"OK, got it."  
7:31	"And so with any sort of let's say, payments you need to make when or like what is what is prompting you to know that you need to make any sort of payments?"  
7:42	"Well, mostly I get statements in the mail, but I'm set up on recurring basis in my mobile banking."  
7:56	"Oh, OK, so it's it's it's automatically taken care of correct."  
8:00	Got it.  
8:01	OK.  
8:02	"And are so are, are there any times, I guess that you are managing, you know, like maybe looking over bills or checking up on things throughout the throughout the months?"  
8:14	"Well, I, I'm always making sure that I'm not late on anything."  
8:18	"And if it looks like something is due before I get my Social Security check, I might pay directly through an app like the card app."  
8:27	"OK, got it."  
8:28	"And what is your system for like checking up on the dates that are that things are due looking at my apps OK, is that something like do you get any notifications or are you e-mail notifications?"  
8:45	Got it.  
8:46	"Everything OK, So it's are you is that your prompt check into things?"  
8:51	Is those emails then?  
8:52	Got it.  
8:52	OK.  
8:53	Is there anything else that that prompts you into checking into any payments needed?  
8:59	"Some of them come in the mail, direct mail."  
9:03	And then I would say I'm trying to think which ones come in direct mail.  
9:09	My credit card statements I prefer to have in direct mail so that I have a hard copy to look at.  
9:18	"But other than that, everything else is pretty much managed within my banking app."  
9:23	"OK, got it."  
9:25	And so you you said you got things in the physical mail.  
9:29	Is that something like where are you typically doing any sort of looking into these finances?  
9:36	Is it at home or is it if you're is it out?  
9:40	I don't my sofa perfect great location.  
9:44	OK all right so is there do you find that there's anything that is challenging or confusing about managing finances overall making sure that payments are sent at the right time?  
9:59	"No, no, OK, great."  
10:03	And do do And are there ever times that you are looking at really all of the the various bills or letters or anything at at one time?  
10:19	"Or is it really just when like one at a time when whenever you get a a prompt, a notification that something is due, I pretty much look at everything around the time of the month that I get my Social Security and make sure that I'm on top of it."  
10:37	So try to keep it all at one time.  
10:40	"Oh, OK, so you're condensing everything."  
10:42	"OK, got it."  
10:44	"All right, so now we're going to look into."  
10:47	"Oh, actually before I ask that, So with the co-pays when you were paying them, I, I now I forget what you had said, but were you managing those at all within your account on the online rather or was that only the physical copies?"  
11:09	"No, I did not get those statements from the VA online."  
11:15	It was all through USPS.  
11:19	Got it.  
11:19	OK.  
11:21	"Oh, and then what was your, or I guess what would have been your, your preferred methods for paying them?"  
11:28	"I, I, I, I know you said now you're not paying any, but well, it's set up in my bill pay."  
11:33	"Oh, bill pay."  
11:36	"OK, so now, now we're actually going to move into some looking at a prototype."  
11:42	Let me have you share your screen 1st.  
11:45	"And then I'm going to, we're going to get through, go through Figma and the prototype."  
11:49	"But first, let me have you share your screen and let me know if you need any help walking through that."  
11:55	"Yeah, I do."  
11:55	I'm not sure.  
11:56	"OK, sure."  
11:57	"So on on the phone, if you want to tap in the middle of the screen at the bottom, there should be a little rectangle and it might say share in rather small letters."  
12:09	You might have to scroll from one side to another.  
12:12	Let me know if you see that.  
12:21	"Oh, you are muted now."  
12:22	"Sorry, I just noticed that."  
12:44	You're still muted.  
12:45	"OK, there we go."  
12:47	"OK, let's see."  
12:49	"OK, let me see if I can get this back up again."  
12:59	"Yeah, you are."  
12:59	You're muted.  
13:00	"Oh, sorry."  
13:00	Yep.  
13:01	There you are.  
13:02	Share.  
13:03	"OK, found it."  
13:04	OK.  
13:04	Great.  
13:05	Green.  
13:09	So it's.  
13:09	Yeah.  
13:10	So it should be share and then share your screen.  
13:12	"Yeah, it says, it says screen broadcast, broadcast."  
13:20	Then it says zoom checked and then start broadcast.  
13:25	"OK, so tap on start broadcast."  
13:28	"OK, I did."  
13:29	"OK, perfect."  
13:29	"OK, now it's going and then you can tap outside of that that perfect."  
13:35	"OK, that's going."  
13:37	"OK, so now let me have you open up Figma."  
13:43	"So wherever you had saved that, that was perfect."  
13:46	There we go.  
13:47	"And then I'm going to have you, I'm going to give you some login information."  
13:50	"Oh, OK, looks like you're already logged in, so give me just a moment."  
13:56	I'm going to send you a link which will come up in Zoom.  
14:02	"OK, let's see if that notification comes up."  
14:05	"Let me have you switch back to the Zoom app, OK, And then if you tap in the middle, you should see the OK, so where it says chat with a little red one on the bottom, tap on that or great."  
14:21	And then tap on that very long URL and that should open up Figma.  
14:26	"All right, it's working slowly."  
14:30	"Sometimes it takes a little bit and you can my image on the top, you can swipe that off to the right just so there's a little more space."  
14:38	Perfect.  
14:39	Love it.  
14:39	"Oh, right, that worked."  
14:41	Love when technology cooperates.  
14:43	"OK, so we are going to in this pretend scenario."  
14:48	"So sorry, let me back up."  
14:49	So what we're looking at doesn't really exist right now on the website or the app.  
14:55	"This is really just a starting off point, a dashboard to get to a few locations."  
15:01	You can actually you can tap anywhere outside.  
15:04	"Yeah, there we go."  
15:05	Perfect.  
15:05	Just to clear those little blue navigation bits.  
15:09	So in this situation we are going to pretend that you have co-pays for some regular doctor visits and prescriptions and we're going to pretend that you have some benefit overpayments for some debt from both disability and education benefits.  
15:27	So that's what everything is here.  
15:30	"Before you tap into anything, what would be your initial thoughts to when you might want to look at just the co-pays or just the overpayments or look at everything together?"  
15:47	"Well, I mean there's buttons for each one, so I can look at one of them individually or a combined statement."  
15:53	But touching an arrow?  
15:57	Yep.  
15:57	Would there be like specific times or instances that you think of that you would specifically just want to look at the co-pays or just the overpayments versus the everything together in the combined statement?  
16:14	"Well, I think I would just want to look at the co-pay bills to see what we do."  
16:19	"OK, good."  
16:20	Let me have you briefly look into co-pay bills here just so you can get a sense of what that is.  
16:28	"Yeah, so I'm not going to have you look too much into this just because we have a few other things."  
16:32	"But what we're looking at here is in this pretend scenario, you have some regular, you visit 2 locations and these are some regular expenses, sorry, some regular co-pays that you have."  
16:46	You can go ahead and tap the review details for like that's right in the middle of the screen under the the Chalmers P Wiley veterans outfit.  
16:57	"Yeah, perfect."  
16:57	Yeah.  
16:58	So this is these are going to be the the bills and the statement transactions for one of the locations.  
17:08	If you want to just briefly look around to explore just so we can I can have you compare this versus a couple other views we're going to be looking at.  
17:19	OK.  
17:21	"Yeah, I, I did so, so this is roughly what is going to appear in the mobile app just so you have a little bit of a little bit of context."  
17:33	"What might be important to you when you're looking at that, the co-pays, I guess, recent statement charges?"  
17:56	"OK, OK."  
17:59	"Other things that would be important to you, let's see."  
18:07	"I mean, maybe resolving the copay, just looking at details."  
18:14	"OK, got it."  
18:19	"OK, let me have you tap."  
18:21	"Oh, actually right there is."  
18:22	Perfect.  
18:22	All right.  
18:23	And let me have you tap on the home button at the very bottom of the screen.  
18:29	Great.  
18:30	"And then briefly go into the overpayment section as well, just so you can have a sense of what this looks like."  
18:37	"So this isn't, again, in our pretend scenario, you have a couple debts from benefit overpayments."  
18:44	"If you want to tap into, scroll around here, look around to get a sense of the information provided."  
18:50	What sort of information would you want to see with the overpayments?  
18:59	Let's see.  
19:06	"I mean, it's all pretty well laid out there."  
19:11	"I mean, I can obviously look at the details and see original amount, current balance due."  
19:26	I mean it looks like all the information's there that I would need to access in order to continue making.  
19:36	"OK, good."  
19:37	And maybe tap on home at the very bottom there.  
19:42	"OK, And now tap into combined statements."  
19:47	"OK, thoughts."  
19:49	"And so the, the the numbers here, the the specific transactions are going to be the same as what we were looking at before."  
19:57	But look around and let me know your thoughts on how the information is presented and what might be important to you.  
20:08	"I mean, it looks like all of it's pretty well laid out as far as previous balance, what it's for, dates, amounts, references."  
20:28	It looks like everything's there that I would need to review and resolve the debt.  
20:34	OK.  
20:40	Are you would there be anything here in in addition that you would want that would be helpful?  
20:49	I don't think so.  
20:52	I can't think of it anything.  
20:54	It looks like everything's here that you need to know.  
21:00	OK.  
21:00	And thoughts on looking at the information in this format here versus what we are just looking at where you had the overpayments and then separated from the Co payments.  
21:13	"Would there be, does one seem more useful to you?"  
21:16	Would you use one over the other do you think?  
21:22	"I don't know that I would use one over the other, but this is obviously much more comprehensive and it has everything laid out so I can always go back to current, current payments or whatever to take care of whatever I needed, you know, making payments."  
21:51	"OK, got it."  
21:51	Explains does it the.  
21:53	"Yeah, that explains everything."  
21:55	It looks like.  
21:57	"OK, everything's here."  
21:57	Got it.  
21:58	"And then scroll to the top of this, what would be your assumption, the button that says download combined statement toward the bottom, what would be your assumption of what that is?"  
22:13	That would be from my record keeping.  
22:16	"OK, got it."  
22:17	And tap into that and see if that's what is this what you're expecting?  
22:22	Is it different?  
22:23	"Yeah, that's exactly what I would would expect."  
22:26	OK.  
22:27	And you said something for your records.  
22:30	"Can you say more about that, about how you might use this?"  
22:33	"Well, I mean, obviously I can use it to print and keep in a file or I can keep it on my phone, which probably takes up a bunch of space."  
22:44	So I still do.  
22:46	I still have a filing system or my VA correspondence.  
22:53	So I would most likely print this OK and then and so you you would add it to that file that you already have.  
22:59	"Yes, got it."  
23:00	OK.  
23:00	And since you mentioned you would also or you you acknowledge that you could also keep it on your phone.  
23:06	Is that something you would do?  
23:11	"Most likely no, most would print it."  
23:14	Print it OK file.  
23:16	All right.  
23:17	Any further thoughts as to why you would choose to print it versus keeping something like this on your phone?  
23:25	I just like to have my hands on a physical piece of paper so that I can look at it.  
23:31	"Sometimes on my phone, if I try to expand, it expands too much."  
23:40	So it's just it's easier for me to read if I have a physical copy.  
23:46	"OK, got it."  
23:48	OK.  
23:48	And then tap on done at the top there.  
23:54	"Yeah, perfect."  
23:54	"So this page here, what on a scale of one to five, how overwhelming, if at all, does this feel to you?"  
24:07	00 all right out of the scale.  
24:09	I love it and are there.  
24:13	"And so looking at the information in this sense, what do you feel, what actions or decisions do you think you might make from looking at this view here?"  
24:27	"Just what needs my immediate attention, OK."  
24:34	"And then how about same question for just looking at the individual co-pays or individual overpayments, thoughts on on actions or decisions you would make on the individuals that that might be different if at all from this version?"  
24:53	"No, I mean, I would obviously take care of the one that required attention most immediately."  
25:01	"OK, all right."  
25:05	"And then in terms of interacting with this information, I know you've already said that you would prefer to print out that statement that we just looked at."  
25:14	"Would there be how, how else might you prefer to interact?"  
25:18	"And when I, when I say interact, that could be printing it out or looking on your laptop or looking on your phone."  
25:26	What's your preference of when you might prefer to interact with the information?  
25:32	"When it coincides with my pay, my pay dates, my income."  
25:42	OK.  
25:42	All right.  
25:42	"So, yes."  
25:43	All right.  
25:43	So timing as to what it lines up.  
25:45	And then how about like how you would prefer to interact with it and in terms of what computer or phone you're on or if you'd prefer to print things out?  
25:56	"I mean, yeah, I always prefer to print things out so I have a physical record of what I've paid and I usually and pin make a notation of what paid when."  
26:12	"Oh, good."  
26:12	"OK, you're marking that."  
26:14	OK.  
26:15	"And then considering the different ways that we have now looked at the information, is there one that jumps out at you as being any more trustworthy than the others?"  
26:32	"No, no, OK, no."  
26:33	I feel like I would be getting the exact same information.  
26:37	Printed it out as to what I'm saying.  
26:40	Got it.  
26:40	"OK, great."  
26:42	"And and now we're going to switch to another, another version to look at."  
26:48	"So tap on the yellow box on the left, the future version a great."  
26:54	So this is another version that we are considering that's showing both the co-pays and the overpayments in this situation.  
27:02	"Look around, have a yeah, have a look around just to see how things are structured here."  
27:15	"OK, let's see."  
27:17	It has today's date.  
27:19	It has total due $75 review and resolve co-pays.  
27:26	I would see when that's due and I'm not seeing that off the top.  
27:35	"I I think that's it's telling me the date, but it's not telling me when it's due."  
27:41	"OK, so you all know that."  
27:42	Got it.  
27:45	"Other than that, I can't think of anything else."  
27:48	"OK, and how about, oh, sorry, go ahead."  
27:54	"Oh, I was going to say, I mean, if there were questions, I would obviously call the number."  
28:01	"OK, got it."  
28:04	"And then how about if you considering your full financial situation in this pretend scenario, how, how would you also look at the overpayments or how how would you want to see those as well?"  
28:24	"I mean, the same, Yeah."  
28:27	"I mean, I don't know why that apparently that Button's not working."  
28:38	A a lot of the buttons don't.  
28:39	"Yes, you you are correct."  
28:40	A lot of the buttons don't work.  
28:41	Yeah.  
28:44	Yeah.  
28:45	"Again, I would just need to see some dates."  
28:48	"OK, so you want to see dates that make it more clear."  
28:50	OK.  
28:55	"And so oh, yeah, go ahead."  
28:56	Today's date.  
28:58	Mm.  
28:58	Hmm.  
29:01	And how about comparing this version here with flipping back and forth the tabs between the co-pays and the overpayments versus the very first one we looked at with the one long list that you scrolled?  
29:19	Thoughts on comparing those two if one might be more useful to you than others?  
29:29	"Well, I mean, I can print out whatever I need to print out, but it looks like there was one that was comprehensive and that's the one that I would want to look at."  
29:41	"Oh, the the, the PDF view."  
29:44	Yeah.  
29:44	"OK, I got it."  
29:46	"Yeah, you could just."  
29:47	So if you tap on the view combined PDF statement at the top there just to make sure this that that's what you're talking about.  
29:53	You don't.  
29:54	"Yeah, tap on that."  
29:55	OK.  
29:56	"All right, so would this be your preference that PDF over let's say this view we're looking at here?"  
30:08	"Yes, it would be OK, got it."  
30:12	"And any other reasons I know since of course printing out is very important to you, any any other reasons that you would prefer that PDF?"  
30:22	It just the way I comprehend things.  
30:26	It's just easier for me to keep it in my mind and keep it straight if I put on a piece of paper as opposed to looking at this and scrolling through it.  
30:38	"OK, got it."  
30:41	"So, so since you mentioned that I can, it's all there, but still prefer to look at a hard copy, a hard copy, you don't want a hard copy."  
30:52	"So would there be, even though of course you, you prefer the hard copy, would there be any instances that you might want to look at this information digitally on your phone?"  
31:03	"Well, just to get a brief snapshot, I I can't think of any other reason initial snapshot."  
31:13	OK.  
31:14	"And when you say snapshot, can you say more about what exactly you are looking for in that snapshot?"  
31:28	I guess just an overview of what's what is being tallied and how it's broken down?  
31:38	OK.  
31:41	"And so that overview, would this view fit your needs or would you be looking for something different?"  
31:48	"No, I keep saying I prefer to see it in a hard copy."  
31:53	So my preference would be to print it out and look at it in a hard copy.  
31:58	I don't have enough on my phone and I typically don't use my computer.  
32:06	"But again, I prefer a hard copy in all instances."  
32:13	"OK, got it."  
32:18	OK.  
32:19	And are there since I know you said you've used the my healthy vet with any it could be really any any apps website.  
32:30	Are you getting any notifications on those or is it all just e-mail or physical copies notifications?  
32:42	Will it like come like coming straight from an app on your phone?  
32:45	For example?  
32:47	"I get notifications about upcoming appointments, text message and e-mail."  
32:54	"Oh, got it, got it."  
32:55	"OK, And how useful or not useful do you find those, those notifications?"  
33:02	They're useful.  
33:03	"OK, one appointment I can check in on my phone and they're reminders, cons reminders."  
33:16	"OK, What sort of in regards to financial management, you know, again we're going to pretend in this scenario you have some overpayment debts and some co-pays."  
33:29	What sort of additional reminders if any would be helpful to you?  
33:38	None that I can think of.  
33:40	Nothing.  
33:40	"OK, OK."  
33:44	"I mean, I feel like I get too many as it is."  
33:47	"So OK is there since you say you you get too many, have have you seen options to reduce the number that you already get?"  
33:58	I'm not sure.  
33:59	"They may say you can stop, but I don't do that because I like the reminders."  
34:04	So it's either I get them or I don't.  
34:06	"Oh, got it."  
34:06	"OK, OK."  
34:13	All right.  
34:15	"Any other thoughts about how the information is, is, is viewed here that or sorry, is presented here that you haven't already shared?"  
34:27	I can't think of anything.  
34:30	I'm not really good about thinking outside the box.  
34:33	And so I know what I know and I I know how the information comes to me and I know all the ways to access it.  
34:45	"So I mean, there's yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."  
34:49	That makes sense.  
34:51	"And I'm just going to check in with my colleagues, Natasha and Parker."  
34:55	"If there are any questions you would like to ask, you can unmute now and ask those."  
35:09	"OK, so that's no, so I believe just checking my notes, make sure I didn't miss anything."  
35:19	I believe that is it.  
35:20	"So yeah, that is it from us."  
35:22	Thank you so much for taking your time and sharing your thoughts.  
35:27	"And all this is always important to talk directly with veterans just to see how we can, how we might be able to improve things in the future."  
35:35	So appreciate you taking the time.  
35:37	I know Para Jean is going to be reaching out to you with a thank you note and I hope you have a great rest of your day.  
35:46	Thank you so much.  
35:47	I appreciate it.  
35:48	"OK, thanks."  
35:49	Take care.  
35:50	Bye bye.
