## **Transcript: P09**

0:02	OK.  
0:02	"So now that we are recording, are you OK that I record the video and audio as we talked today?"  
0:08	"Yes, ma'am."  
0:08	Great.  
0:09	And are you OK if we potentially use any clips from this session to show our VA partners?  
0:14	"Yep, no problem."  
0:16	"OK, great."  
0:16	Thank you.  
0:17	"So first, I'd love to know at whatever level you're comfortable a little bit about yourself as a veteran could be what branch you served and when you retired or separated."  
0:28	Yeah.  
0:28	"So I prior \[redacted\], separated around 2014."  
0:35	"Currently living in the \[redacted\], say living here quite some time."  
0:43	Just a \[redacted\].  
0:47	"But yeah, just a little bit about me."  
0:50	"OK, great And then what has been your interaction with Veteran Affairs since then?"  
0:58	Very interactive.  
0:59	"I've been utilizing the health services vividly since I got out been, you know, different things, been organizing, helping, you know, their wage and health issues and then of course getting in different tools."  
1:14	"I've been in different groups, different study groups and now going back to school and of course, you know, school different sometimes, but now I'm going back to school to utilizing my VA benefits for that as well."  
1:24	So very active involvement.  
1:27	"Oh great, great."  
1:29	And then how about anything?  
1:32	Are you using the VA app website or app or what's been your experience with those?  
1:38	"Well, just started using the VA website a little bit more, excuse me, a little bit more frequent kind of off and on, but I've always been using the My Healthy Vet and things like that."  
1:48	"So, but I've been on the VA website since the transition more now than before."  
1:55	"OK, so are you, I know you said you were on, you had the Myhealthy vet."  
1:59	"Are you on the, the, the current VA mobile app at all?"  
2:02	"I, I, I haven't used the app."  
2:04	I haven't downloaded the app yet.  
2:05	Just been on the website primarily just always been on the phone and go into the app.  
2:10	"I'm sorry, desktop version."  
2:12	"That's OK, got it."  
2:13	"OK, so so you're, you're not using the website on your phone at all."  
2:17	"Hi, I'm using the website, just not the application on my phone."  
2:20	"Got it, got it."  
2:21	OK.  
2:23	And are there certain times that you're actively choosing to use the website on your phone as opposed to on your desktop computer?  
2:31	"Well, just I'm always on my phone more on my phone and I I usually, you know, have a work computer, but I'm always happily on my phone, on my tablet."  
2:38	So I'm just utilizing it from there more just frequent on my phone.  
2:44	Convenience.  
2:44	"So convenience, OK, makes sense."  
2:47	"All right, so now we're going to move into the financial portion and I want to make sure you're only sharing what you are comfortable."  
2:53	"Like I said before, I don't have any access to your records at all, so only sharing what you would like."  
3:00	So what has been your experience with benefit over payment debt over the since you separated?  
3:09	"Well, that's some experience."  
3:11	I mean quite a bit of experiences.  
3:13	"I've been of course, getting the letters in the mail and things like that."  
3:15	"So I've just been kind of trying to, you know, understand, you know, where it's coming from in one instance and just kind of where that all stemmed from."  
3:22	And then trying to manage the payments as well.  
3:25	"Then getting that in because again, it's just, it's, it's just a little definitely trying to, you know, pinch pennies and cut corners in some ways and not just trying to overall budget."  
3:34	"So I'm just, but again, just trying to understand where those co-pays are coming from and how they're being, you know, analyzed because I'm, you know, under the impression that there wouldn't be in a sense."  
3:43	"But I think, you know, as, as time progresses, I'm just like aware what is happening, kind of just a clear understanding of the co-pays and what that all comes from."  
3:51	"And it's just, is it every visit, every, you know, just how to get any more clarification on those copays is what I've been seeing and trying to get some clarification on that has been my, my, my challenge."  
4:01	Got it.  
4:02	"OK, so with the copays and when are you learning about whenever you do have a copay?"  
4:08	"Well, I do mention it when I go to the doctor, but I do get some info when I'm talking to the nurses."  
4:13	"But a lot of it, you know, you know, if I remember to bring it up if I'm there."  
4:16	But usually I try to go online.  
4:18	"If I do see something on the website or if I don't ask my doctor or the nurse, then I'll check online to see what's there, kind of read up on the VA website to get more information on it."  
4:28	OK.  
4:30	OK.  
4:30	"And, and are you, are you looking on the website for specific bills that have been sent to you?"  
4:36	"Yes, yes."  
4:38	"To see what you know, what's you know, what day, what time, like what is it for?"  
4:41	And just kind of gave more information on it.  
4:43	Mm hmm.  
4:44	OK.  
4:44	And is that the only way that you're finding out or is there any other way that you're finding out when when you have a bill that you have to pay?  
4:51	"No, just that in the mail."  
4:52	"And then that's yeah, somewhere."  
4:54	"OK, good."  
4:55	Have there been any times that any of the co-pay bills have been a surprise or have you always known that they're coming?  
5:02	"Well, some of them have been a surprise due to, again, because of the the medication."  
5:06	"So I, I didn't know that that would be, you know, a part of, you know, Co paid, but it's usually the one I get my medication."  
5:13	I don't know.  
5:14	"Again, it's some of it's surprised because I know I go and then I'll get a bill for my meds."  
5:18	"So it's just a little, it's a little confusing on what's Co paid and what's not."  
5:23	"OK, got it."  
5:24	"What said, you said it was confusing."  
5:27	What could be done to make it less confusing?  
5:30	"Well, a little less."  
5:32	"I think just kind of just maybe just information prior like hey, this is what's going to happen."  
5:36	"Just a little bit of communication prior to that like during the visit, hey, this is what's your will be expecting in the mail as opposed to just kind of like, hey, here's a bill for you know which I get it."  
5:48	"Just I think overall just information prior to that bill would be helpful for me so I can kind of figure out, OK, what I need to do, what I have."  
5:57	And it just so that I know and I'm aware prior then of course getting in the mail to think a month after the month or two after the fact.  
6:06	Maybe just a little bit more of a heads up.  
6:08	"Yeah, OK, got it."  
6:08	"And so is, is that a typical timeline a month or two after you receive?"  
6:13	"About a month or yeah, usually see the bill about a month after."  
6:17	Got it.  
6:17	"OK, so when you do receive the bill, is it clear to you what your next steps or any options might be?"  
6:25	"Well, it just, it gives me, OK, it gives me the amount."  
6:29	"And then I think if I'm not mistaken, on the very bottom of the bill, it has like a number then a website."  
6:35	"So it's, it's, it's clear in a sense of here's a number and here's the e-mail that, or here's a link that you would go to pay the bills."  
6:44	"So it's, it's that and I think it directs me back to the VA website."  
6:47	"So it's just that and it's A1 pager telling me, you know, if you want to call to make a payment or something over the phone or if you want to make it online."  
6:54	"So it's, you know, it's not, you know, hard, but it's just, you know, those two."  
6:58	So those two things at the very bottom of the page that directs you to either call or to the VA's website.  
7:06	OK.  
7:06	"And what what what is your method of, of calling versus going to the website?"  
7:11	What what's better for you?  
7:12	"Oh, for me, it's the it's the website through the website."  
7:15	"Yeah, got it."  
7:16	And so you're you're making all of your payment to the website too.  
7:19	"Yeah, it'll be through the website."  
7:21	"OK, got it."  
7:23	"And and so, so you've said you you receive letters and you go into your account and look at the bills there."  
7:29	Has there been any other communication that you've received regarding these co-pays?  
7:33	"Oh, no, that's it."  
7:35	That's normal.  
7:37	"Yeah, OK, got it."  
7:38	"And then how about for any, so you mentioned the the medical co-pays, how about any debt that results from benefit overpayments?"  
7:48	"Oh, no, I I haven't gotten anything for that."  
7:53	Thank you.  
7:54	"But no, I haven't, I haven't received anything that I'm aware of about that."  
7:57	"I'm assuming that it would come in the mail at like the bills, but I would hope to have some type of communication to tell me that, you know, that there is a benefit that they overpaid ahead of time or somebody calls me to tell me that because that was especially with those type of benefits being so excessive."  
8:13	"I mean the co-pay seemed pretty lower, but those benefits usually are pretty, pretty healthy dollar amount."  
8:19	So something like that.  
8:20	"I would definitely want to know ahead of time that what to expect or get some type of call and you know, let me know."  
8:26	"But OK, got it."  
8:28	Yeah.  
8:28	OK.  
8:29	So now I want to talk about times that you're actively managing finances.  
8:34	"And when I say actively managed, that could be anything like looking on the website for the co-pays or maybe it maybe you're calling and this could be of your like wider financial situation."  
8:45	"So any other, you know, banking, credit card, any other utilities, are there specific times and places that you're managing?"  
8:55	"And then that's, that could be like certain times of the month or you're always in this physical location when you're doing a sort of management."  
9:02	"Talk to me about when and, and how you're managing the finances."  
9:06	"Well, I usually manage based on my time."  
9:09	I pay periods.  
9:10	"So, you know, I try to get in there at least honestly, the month before I try to start the month before to start preparing for the next month."  
9:21	"But then of course, then avidly as the pay periods be begin to approach, then I start to manage that way, like week by week in a way, say, hey, I checked off this payment or this particular bill."  
9:32	And then I kind of stay with try to stay within that budget.  
9:35	"If hopefully you know, nothing comes up, but it's like a prior month kind of get everything down and what I'm expected all of my like, like my like buy now, pay now type stuff and or my, my monthly bills, recurring bills have everything on the spreadsheet and then check it off."  
9:51	"But it's, you know, monthly, weekly and they take it from there."  
9:55	"OK, so you mentioned a spreadsheet."  
9:56	"Are you, are you keeping everything organized that way?"  
9:59	"Yes, on the spreadsheet."  
10:00	"Yeah, on the OK, got it."  
10:01	"And do you have a system for like how often you're both updating and, or checking that?"  
10:07	"Well, just kind of daily."  
10:09	"Honestly, I'm checking daily just to make sure that everything aligns with what I what's going out and what's, you know, what's obviously what's coming out of the bank account, just to make sure that I'm good And then that that paid it on time of that I don't occur any any late fees."  
10:24	"OK, I got it."  
10:25	"And so you said you're, you're checking daily."  
10:28	Are there roughly daily?  
10:29	"Is there anything else that might prompt you to, to like check in with a spreadsheet or to check in with any specific bills?"  
10:37	"No, that's it."  
10:38	"Kind of like I just just my, well, I have a calendar with some of my bills on the calendar on my, you know, calendar on my phone."  
10:45	I had that set.  
10:46	I had that set up prior.  
10:47	So some of those are still recurring on my calendar.  
10:49	"But that's the only prompt that I'm usually I'm really getting is my calendar or kind of honestly just kind of trying to remember, OK, this is what's due this month and what we'll do what's due this day and that day."  
11:00	So that's kind of how I kind of operate currently.  
11:04	I got it.  
11:05	"And when you're thinking of the various bills that you need to pay throughout the month or the year, are there ways that you're organizing them in your head, like thinking about these two kind of go together or these three kind of go together?"  
11:21	"So what I do is so say again, with my pay period."  
11:24	"So if my pay period lands on like let's just say, for example, the 15th and try to get everything from the 1st to the 14th or 15th and pay it with, you know, around that time."  
11:34	"And then, you know, managing it from and then anything like to the end of the month, whatever that check is, kind of planning around those dates so that it's paid on that time."  
11:44	"OK, so so it's it's it's date oriented then."  
11:46	Yeah.  
11:47	"OK, got it."  
11:48	Makes sense.  
11:50	"And is there, are there ways that you're looking at, I think I'd ask this like looking at various bills, like like let's say you have some that are due, you have the 1st through the 10th, for example."  
12:06	Are there ways that you're looking at all those together?  
12:10	"I know you said you've got your spreadsheets, but are there, are there other ways that you're, you're viewing and, and managing that, that information for a few bills at a time?"  
12:18	"Well, it's not, I would like say I have two."  
12:20	"Well, just the spreadsheets."  
12:21	"Honestly, I have one that gives me by kind of putting 2 separate spreadsheets."  
12:24	I put one with all of my bills for the month.  
12:28	I laid out all of this and what's going on.  
12:30	"Then in the separate spreadsheet, I break out my payment, my paychecks, and I put those bills that are due for like send that check and I put everything that's doing what I have, what's owed and what's not going to have left out leftover in that check."  
12:44	"And then saying for the 2nd pay period or the third, if if that lands in that month and it tells me what the overage is for the month."  
12:52	"So that's, yeah, just using those spreadsheets."  
12:54	"Honestly, throughout the time I've kind of had to create a system that's a system I've managed."  
12:59	"I'm able to, but just going back and forth to that spreadsheet on my phone or my tablet."  
13:05	And is there anything that is helpful or would you want like from let's say from VA in terms of getting the bills?  
13:12	Is there any more information that would be helpful to you with the information they send you?  
13:18	"I think and maybe getting it in, I don't even know if it comes an e-mail, but maybe getting an e-mail notification as well or texts."  
13:26	"I, I mean, I'm saying a text or e-mail would help."  
13:29	I think they said.  
13:30	"I don't know if that's already something 'cause I don't, I think I've seen anything, any communication outside of that."  
13:35	Or maybe I just maybe I don't have a setup.  
13:36	Could be.  
13:37	"But yeah, maybe additional communication outside of the letters so I can all move it faster maybe."  
13:44	"OK, so faster communication."  
13:45	"Yeah, that makes sense."  
13:47	"OK, so we're going to move into looking at a few few prototypes."  
13:52	So let me have you go and share your screen 1st and then we're going to open up Figma and I'm going to send you a link and let me know if you need help with sharing screen.  
14:03	"Let's see, open up Figma."  
14:06	"Actually, if you, if you first share your screen, it'll it'll that'll be easier to just for me to get you the password that we have for Figma."  
14:14	Give me one second share.  
14:23	"OK, Can you see my screen?"  
14:25	Yes.  
14:26	Love when things work fast.  
14:27	All right now.  
14:29	"OK, so now you can open up Figma and I'm going to give you a test account to log into here."  
14:36	Can you still see it?  
14:37	Right?  
14:37	Yep.  
14:37	All right.  
14:38	"And if you want to swipe my image off to the right, it'll there we go."  
14:41	Gives you a little more space.  
14:43	"OK, so tap log into Figma, go to continue and under e-mail I'm going to have you do VA test 000@gmail.com and then under password."  
15:07	"This is a rather long password, but it is a pattern on your keyboard, so hopefully it'll be easier to see."  
15:14	So it's capital A.  
15:15	"Everything else from now on is lowercase Z, SXDC, FV2468, Go ahead and log in."  
15:34	I don't need to save that password.  
15:35	Continue with mobile app.  
15:40	So that's OK.  
15:41	"All right, see, it's coming."  
15:42	"OK, so I'm going to now send you a link."  
15:45	Give me just a moment.  
15:50	"OK, so go back to Zoom and in the chat of Zoom, there will be a link for you to open."  
15:57	It's just slightly different from those.  
16:03	"Yeah, there we go."  
16:03	Yeah.  
16:03	So tap in the middle at the bottom.  
16:05	It should come up the.  
16:06	"Yeah, the the chat on the left."  
16:08	There we go.  
16:08	"Tap once on that very long URL, OK, and then you have to swipe my image off it."  
16:15	"It keeps it likes to come back, I think every time you like switch to the switch the apps All right, great."  
16:23	That was very fast.  
16:24	I love when technology actually cooperates.  
16:27	"OK, so in this example we're going to pretend that you do have some benefit over payments from both some disability and education benefits."  
16:39	Plus in this situation we're going to pretend that you also have some medical Co payments from both regular doctor visits and prescriptions.  
16:47	So the what we're looking at is just really a dashboard that we kind of made-up.  
16:51	Part of this looks like what the app looks like and part of it such as the giant yellow buttons not actually in the app anywhere.  
16:59	"So before we tap on anything thinking that so and knowing that you have both overpayments and co-pays, any thoughts on when you might want to look at each of those individually as opposed to when you'd want to look at all of those together?"  
17:20	"Oh man, I I don't think of a time, just trying to think."  
17:25	"I mean for myself, honestly."  
17:26	"I I mean, honestly, if I see something in both of them, I'm going to check."  
17:30	"Honestly, that's going to be my trigger to check it."  
17:33	"But I mean at a time, maybe if it's maybe if I've just recently had a visit from the doctor, so maybe IA little after that, but just trying to think about it like an actual time frame."  
17:44	"But me, if I'm an avid apper."  
17:46	"So I think I know I'm always going to check kind of just to see if something's happening and something have, you know, just maybe sporadically."  
17:54	"I wouldn't say daily, but maybe once or twice a week, especially if it's something that could have, you know, something that payment wise or I need to pay something."  
18:03	It's almost like like my bank account in a way.  
18:05	"So so yeah, sure."  
18:09	OK.  
18:09	"And then so with that data checking either, you know, a few times a week or daily are are you thinking you would you would want to go into like just the co-pay bills or just the overpayments or if you'd want to look at everything together, everything together, everything together would be better."  
18:23	"OK, got it."  
18:25	"So let me have you actually before I ask that, tell me any, any expectations you have of what you will find in the section called combined statements."  
18:35	I'm going to have you tap it in just a moment.  
18:37	"But before we do, what are you expecting to find there?"  
18:40	"I'm assuming that's the two of them, the copay and overpayments combined, I'm assuming, yes."  
18:48	"OK, Yeah."  
18:48	So let me have you tap into combined statement.  
18:52	You can just tap outside.  
18:53	"Yeah, outside the blue buttons."  
18:55	"All right, then tap into combined statement."  
18:58	"So, yeah."  
18:58	So here we have the combined statement.  
19:01	"So scroll around to get a sense of what is here and let me know any thoughts of what you're seeing, what might be useful, what might be not what not what might not be useful."  
19:17	"OK, the cloning information Zoner CofE call viewing resolve OK, subscription."  
19:28	So this has the description.  
19:37	"OK, OK, got it here the clinic description, you know, So this is the Yeah, sorry."  
19:44	Is this the total amount here at the top?  
19:47	"Well, let me let me turn that around."  
19:49	What would be most important for you to to see and to understand when opening a page like this?  
19:56	Just I think we're from downward to down reading down.  
20:00	"Maybe the total, if it's breaking it down line by line, that would cause."  
20:06	"OK, yeah, 'cause I'm seeing 35 'cause then of course once I look at everything, then I'll start looking at the amounts."  
20:15	"To see OK, what was charged, what's owed and then kind of going in that, you know, segment, yes, OK, we got $5.00."  
20:27	"So yeah, I think just kind of a little bit more clarification on the thirst because I'm like already 35 balance description."  
20:32	Is that a bill?  
20:33	Is that something I'm assuming that is a bill?  
20:36	"Oh, OK."  
20:36	"Yeah, that is a bill because it's a little reference."  
20:39	"OK, so say 5, you know, patient."  
20:45	"OK, OK, I see right here total due."  
20:47	Never mind it says at the bottom and receipt and is and this just another this would be another bill here.  
21:03	OK.  
21:05	"Yeah, it's a little."  
21:08	the VA likes to kind of have that like scrolling that whole scrolling down the method that they use to kind of have everything in one screen.  
21:20	"How, since you mentioned this, scrolling down everything on one screen, how does that work for you?"  
21:26	"I mean, it's not bad."  
21:27	"I think it's just, it's kind of blocky."  
21:28	"So I think obviously if I'm on my phone, I'm gonna have to, you know, go through everything a little bit slower just to make sure I didn't miss anything."  
21:35	"But it just, you know, a lot of definitely a lot of scrolling."  
21:37	"But and then 'cause then I'm assuming it's going to have every, so say if I'm an avid person that's going to the doctor and I'm going to have a full page of just going through every single history of payment."  
21:49	"Well, I mean, if it's multiple charges, then I'm going to have to make sure I'm looking at it correctly and not because it's just so much on one page."  
22:00	"So then OK, my overpayment of charges, then it gives me that, OK, it's going to break it down to each one."  
22:08	It is probably a little bit easier because everything that the doctor has the information with my visits and all of that.  
22:17	"Does this tell you what the overpayment balance increase and it was like a time frame is this is this is this OK balance increase is, is supposed to give us like a what payment or time frame that the balance was, where the balance increase was on?"  
22:35	Is it for the date?  
22:38	"Oh, so you want, you want to know more detail about like what, what this balance increase is, is that right?"  
22:43	"Yeah, yeah."  
22:45	"So like, yeah, where was it, like stemming from what, you know, maybe that payment, what payment, whatever information that would help."  
22:53	"I'm gonna go, I'm gonna pull them."  
22:55	"I'm gonna go back to everything and say, OK, well, then what was that?"  
22:57	"But OK, so you'd be, you'd be, you'd be checking into all the details of what these are."  
23:02	"Yeah, yeah, makes sense."  
23:06	"Pounds increase, OK, plus or minus."  
23:12	"Yes, especially increase."  
23:13	OK.  
23:16	And then is there a way to filter the date range?  
23:22	I don't think there was.  
23:25	"It sounds like that, but would that be important to you?"  
23:27	"Yeah, for my, yeah, for me, I like to filter, being able to have the filter option as well just to go back, see if I just want to see current or like say 202524 because if it's giving me everything again, I'm I'm really going down."  
23:50	"And then OK, of course, 911 dead."  
23:53	What tuition?  
24:00	"Oh, wow."  
24:06	"OK, so thoughts on on seeing everything together, both the the copay charges and then also the the benefit overpayment debt?"  
24:20	I think it's it's definitely helpful.  
24:24	I think it's just because it's just so much on one screen.  
24:29	"It just it starts to kind of flow, But I think that's just what it is because of you know, everybody's different."  
24:34	"But no, I don't I don't have an issue."  
24:38	I think it's just a lot in one screen that you can see and then you guys bring then it's broken out into the post 911 and the other dead and it's school learned tuition.  
24:46	So it gives you a lot of information in one screen.  
24:49	So that's very helpful.  
24:50	"I think is just some of the information if we if we make filtering, sorting it so you can drill down what you're wanting to see and that will help."  
24:57	"So if you want to see everything, yay."  
24:59	"But if you don't want to see everything, you have an option to kind of filter."  
25:04	"OK, I got it."  
25:05	"And since you mentioned scrolling a lot and seeing a lot of information here, on a scale of one to five, how overwhelming or not does this does this feel to you?"  
25:16	I'll say A33 right in the middle.  
25:20	"OK, got it."  
25:21	"And so outside of filtering, so you're just seeing like certain date ranges, what else might be it might help to feel, to make this feel less overwhelming, honestly."  
25:34	That's it.  
25:36	I didn't maybe.  
25:38	"Yeah, I think that's it."  
25:39	"I don't, I think everything is in its sections, you know, properly."  
25:44	I don't think anything else is sticking out right now besides that.  
25:49	"OK, I got it."  
25:50	And how about would there be back up?  
25:55	Any thoughts on or any further thoughts on one?  
25:58	"You might want to look at a page like this, which has all of your money owed versus just going in and looking at the co-pays or just going in and looking at the overpayments."  
26:11	"Well, if I'm trying to take care of both debts at the same time, just trying to knock them all out at one time, then I would look at both of them and you know, just in that realm."  
26:20	"But if I'm like, say I'm maybe just going to focus on the smaller bill 1st and then attack that one, I think it's just based on, you know, what I'm budget wise, what I'm trying to take or what's due or owed first."  
26:31	I'm going to prioritize that.  
26:33	"OK, got it."  
26:34	"And how about when or are there, how would you prefer to interact with this particular information?"  
26:42	"And when I say how that could be like, do you like it on your phone?"  
26:46	Would you like it on your desktop computer or would you want to print anything out?  
26:49	Do you want things coming in e-mail anything like that?  
26:52	"Well, oh man, if I was probably too much to begging for too much if I said all of them, but but because I I like the fact that I can you know, see it here now I can see it in the app yes, in the desktop."  
27:07	If I may have the same view if I want to see it in a little bit larger screen in my desktop.  
27:12	"And then if I want to print out something and maybe just kind of see it and maybe if I want to take it to the doctor and have them validate something and I can print it off just to make sure that my references, my everything matches up, especially if I'm going in for a visit soon, then I can just print it off."  
27:29	"But I think just honestly, all of them."  
27:31	"And then if I'm getting an alert telling me, hey, you have a bill, just go look at the app just will help me or it has a link to send me straight to that bill through the app or through the the website, then that'll help me out a lot as well."  
27:45	OK.  
27:45	"Do you, since you mentioned a notification for the app, is that something you use in it like with with other apps, you'd like any notifications?"  
27:53	Yeah.  
27:54	"OK, got it."  
27:56	Maybe scroll to the top of this page.  
27:58	"Yeah, maybe those little that little automatic scroll to the top."  
28:04	Yeah.  
28:05	Have have we?  
28:06	We didn't build one of those in the prototype here.  
28:09	What would be?  
28:11	"So looking at the download combined statement button toward the bottom, what's your assumption of what you would find in that?"  
28:17	"It would give me a statement history for my, both my copay and my, my copay and my overpayment statements."  
28:28	"OK, got it."  
28:29	"Maybe tap on that and see if that is, is this, is this about what you're expecting?"  
28:34	Is it different?  
28:36	"Yeah, this is yeah, this is corporate charges."  
28:39	"Yeah, no, this is this is this is it."  
28:42	"OK, thoughts on using the information in this format versus the list that you were just looking at when you might use one versus the other?"  
28:54	"Oh, oh, man, that's a good question, man."  
28:58	"This, I would definitely look at this because it's, it's itemized."  
29:02	"It gives me a full history and it gives me, but looking at it, sorry."  
29:07	"Yep, that's fine."  
29:08	"That's, that's our kind of fake way to pretend that you're zooming in within the within the prototype."  
29:15	OK yeah.  
29:16	And it gives me my dates and this gives me each and every single copay that I owe for those dates too.  
29:22	"So it gives me everything in one chunk versus yeah, yeah, it does give you a little bit more."  
29:32	There's less pages.  
29:32	Look at these 3 pages.  
29:33	"I mean, obviously there's some more scrolls."  
29:35	"I don't know how many pages that is, but this is a good way to put everything in, to condense everything in a one."  
29:43	"OK, got it."  
29:44	"And then when, when, when would you think you might use this PDF?"  
29:49	"You said it's, it's, it's more, it's more condensed."  
29:53	"No, I think I would honestly be, if I'm coming in here, if I knew that this was here, I would kind of come to this first before I even go scroll, start scrolling everything quicker."  
30:02	"Knowing it based on my knowledge, knowing what I know."  
30:06	Then I would probably come here 1st and then just get everything and start kind of checking off what's owed and what I've paid.  
30:12	"Oh, got it."  
30:12	OK.  
30:13	"And so you said checking off, Would that be something you're looking at on the phone on the desktop?"  
30:18	Would you print it out?  
30:20	"I'm just more so on the phone, if I have to, if I like say something that I can't see, maybe if I need to be like, hey, I just I need to make it bigger so I can make an example when I was trying to make it larger and it would just kind of all kind of just made it one section."  
30:33	"If I need to bring it over so I can have a larger view, then I would do that."  
30:37	Got it.  
30:37	OK.  
30:37	Maybe press done at the top and then tap the home button at the very bottom of the screen.  
30:45	"Oh, sorry, yeah, there we go."  
30:46	Perfect.  
30:47	And then let's look at the co-pay bills section at the top there.  
30:54	"So this is, this is what the what the app will look like roughly at some point in the in the future."  
31:04	"But looking at just the co-pay bills, have a look around briefly and yeah, let me know your thoughts on the way that this is presented and when you might use, let's say just looking at the co-pays versus both copay and overpayment that we were just looking at."  
31:24	"Yeah, I definitely will use this."  
31:26	"I mean, I do like the way that it's laid out."  
31:28	"One, you know, each bill I would in the dates, I would use this more so when I am alerted that I have a copay based on the notification or e-mail or, you know, mail."  
31:39	So this is when I would be prompted to come here.  
31:41	"OK, got it."  
31:43	Yeah.  
31:44	This looks.  
31:45	"Yeah, clear cut."  
31:46	Would it tell me if I'm past due?  
31:48	"Well, I guess you have."  
31:49	"So would it's if it's a past due bill, would it?"  
31:52	"Well, is there an example?"  
31:55	"My balance was updated and I want to pay your bills an hour, I hope."  
31:58	"OK, OK."  
31:58	I see kind of here the kind of the this one looks a little different from that one.  
32:04	So is this one like more like current and this is more past due in this particular scenario with this the information here is actually the same as what we are looking at before.  
32:18	"OK, if you want to tap into the the details of that top one just to get a brief view of yeah, so this is one bill here for your co-pays maybe all we do."  
32:32	"So OK, so that's got it."  
32:39	OK.  
32:39	"Yeah, it looks OK."  
32:41	"OK, just look kind of differ from the first one."  
32:43	OK.  
32:44	Yeah.  
32:45	"And so you said you you might wanna come here instead for when you're alerted that you do have a bill, is that right?"  
32:52	Yeah.  
32:52	"When I'm have a bill, I'll, you know, pop in here real fast."  
32:55	It's more convenient and quick.  
32:57	"OK, got it."  
32:59	And how about looking at the information on this one where you're just having the co-pays compared with the full combined statement of seeing both co-pays and overpayments?  
33:11	Is there one that you feel you would trust more than the other?  
33:19	"No, I don't think I would have trust one over the loan."  
33:24	I don't think I would have any one that I would trust more than the other.  
33:27	"I mean, based on the fact that they're both, they should be the same."  
33:30	"So if there's one that's showing different from the other, then I would be a little bit concerned because it should be the same data."  
33:36	"So yeah, no, I shouldn't do that."  
33:40	Got it.  
33:40	And then any further thoughts on one version being any more useful than the other?  
33:50	"No, I think there would be, you know, used for different they would be beneficial in their own way because again, I'm quicker at get through this."  
33:58	It can be done.  
33:59	"But if I want to get a little bit more deeper dive into the both of my bills and the subsets of the bills, then I'll look into the, you know, my combined statement."  
34:07	So they both have different beneficial parts.  
34:11	"OK, different, different sections."  
34:12	Got it.  
34:13	OK.  
34:13	And let me have you tap where it says co-pay bills at the top here at the top of this page.  
34:25	"Yeah, there we go."  
34:25	And then tap where it says home at the bottom.  
34:29	"OK, So we're going to have I'm going to have you look at a different design for a combined statement."  
34:36	"Tap where it says future version B OK, so this this is not anywhere in the app or website right now, but look around this one and let me know your thoughts on how this information is presented."  
34:53	"And again, it's going to be the same, the same numbers as we were looking at before, just in a different format."  
34:58	Got it.  
34:59	I love the toggles.  
35:00	I love the you do.  
35:00	OK.  
35:01	Yeah.  
35:03	What what do you like about them?  
35:05	"I just love the fact you can see, you know, they're all in one."  
35:07	You can just toggle between 1:00 and the other and not have to leave the screens.  
35:11	"OK, got it."  
35:12	I love it.  
35:14	So OK so this just gives me my OK So this I would assume that any OK this is the for the clinic with that particular clinic for that clinic OK outpatient OK and gives me my bills OK notice the rights and responsibility leaves the numbers to call where does it OK OK resolve my debt.  
35:51	Cool.  
35:52	"No, I think this is a veteran info can go up and down."  
35:57	"OK, yeah, I like the the cascading."  
36:03	The this is called the cascading sections.  
36:08	That was a little accordions.  
36:09	"Yeah, yeah."  
36:10	Open it.  
36:11	OK What what what do you like about those?  
36:14	"Well, just it just sucks that I can open it, close it, and then I can kind of get it out the way if I don't want to see it anymore so I can go to the next thing, but still know that it's there."  
36:22	OK got it.  
36:23	"So how you're looking at both the copays and overpayments, how, how clear is, is the information presented here to you?"  
36:32	"Well, it's very clear."  
36:34	"It's, I mean, it's rare right there."  
36:36	It's not like it's spinning.  
36:37	"And I can, I can see what, what's due, what's old."  
36:40	"And then it gives me a nice breakdown in each, you know, in every section telling me what's what."  
36:48	"OK, got it."  
36:50	"And how about, so let's say if this were built as is, let's say in the app, and I know you said you don't aren't currently using the app, but how likely do you think you would be to to use this if it were built in the app?"  
37:04	I would be very likely to use it.  
37:07	Yeah.  
37:07	OK.  
37:09	Any thoughts on specifically in what instances you would open up the app and look at this?  
37:16	"Well, I mean, I understand what it would be added kind of in my opinion added to my rotation of app usage."  
37:22	"I would probably check in just to make sure that I'm not missing anything, just to see if there is a like on a more of a weekly basis."  
37:31	So I would add it to my rotation.  
37:34	OK.  
37:34	"So checking on in on a weekly basis, are there would there be anything here that you feel would be missing for how you you prefer to manage your finance and keep up with everything?"  
37:48	"No, no, I don't think anything is missing."  
37:51	"OK, let me have you tap on the view combined PDF statement on the top."  
37:57	"This is actually going to be the same as what we looked at, but thoughts on viewing the PDF as it is laid out here versus what you just looked at with the two different tabs?"  
38:14	"No, no, same with this particular layout is there with would would that be, I'm sorry, go ahead."  
38:23	I don't know.  
38:23	I think it would still be good.  
38:24	It would still be good.  
38:25	"OK, And thoughts on when you might prefer to use this this PDF layout here versus the one we just looked at before with the two tabs only if I have any additional questions like if I want to just, you know, verify what's there."  
38:40	"OK, what what will be helpful for verification on this view that you wouldn't get on the other one?"  
38:50	"I think the other way out now, like I said, seeing it that way, it would be a little bit more easier on the eyes and I can kind of go through verses before."  
38:57	"But in here, I think I just would look at if there's anything that maybe a balance or something that looked a little off or wanted."  
39:05	I wanted to verify if something was missed.  
39:07	"Well, maybe is there a character limit that would be on the there wouldn't be any character character limits on the on the the view that we were just saying correct in terms of like how much information is being shown Unsure."  
39:26	Can you press done?  
39:27	I want to make sure I understand what you're saying.  
39:29	So can you give me an example of where you might run it to a character?  
39:32	"Yes, I see here if there's a description that's kind of long and cut off."  
39:36	"And so I would need to see if there's something else I would need to jump to the combined to see if there's a greater explanation because, you know, sometimes it could be longer than you know, 1."  
39:46	"You know, that little word or is there it should have everything show because I'm getting us again."  
39:51	"If I'm not seeing everything that I need to see, it would be the only reason I would need to jump to a full statement."  
39:57	"OK, now I see that makes sense."  
39:58	"OK, and let me have you Scroll down to the bottom going to get you to the other version."  
40:05	Yeah.  
40:05	So go to combined statement A and.  
40:11	"What, what, if anything, are you noticing that is different on this version A versus the version B?"  
40:18	We just looked at just the like what's old and everything is a little bit different.  
40:25	I think the obviously the design is different.  
40:29	"From the very looks of it, it's not as certainly different."  
40:36	I think it's just the layout.  
40:43	"Yeah, the overall design at the beginning is very different than information."  
40:48	"I mean, that's still the same."  
40:49	"But this the design where I had the copay information and all that and it kind of was the dates that it was due, that's the same."  
40:58	"So I would like to, I would love to know that just kind of upfront."  
41:02	"So if I know Oh, oh the date."  
41:03	OK see the dates missing.  
41:07	"So yeah, there's definitely a design difference between the two."  
41:12	"OK in case can you switch back to the version BI think we're in a right now, right."  
41:18	Yeah.  
41:18	So go back to B OK are you in the right one?  
41:28	"Yeah, yeah, this is Yeah, this is B Yeah."  
41:30	OK.  
41:32	OK.  
41:32	"So the so the only difference here, that is where it says co-pay bills and then the you're receiving this billing statement section with this version you had you had expanded it to see it and the other one it was already open."  
41:49	Thoughts on what might be better for your purposes if you have a preference between the two?  
41:58	"OK, so, OK, so you said I expanded the one I think it would."  
42:03	"Oh, man, I didn't even notice that."  
42:05	"OK, yeah, it would just be the the not having an expand."  
42:10	I guess in the beginning you would prefer it to be collapsed.  
42:15	"Yeah, collapsed initially."  
42:17	Got it.  
42:18	"OK, And can you tell me why you'd prefer to have a collapse first?"  
42:21	"Well, I think it's just again, easier than I can start going in and I'll be able to kind of drill into what I'm looking at first without having kind of funnel thoroughly through some of the other information that's there."  
42:33	"You know, you're seeing this billing statement, you know it's, but obviously it has to be in there, but I don't really need to see that initially."  
42:40	"But yeah, collapse would be beneficial."  
42:43	"OK, All right."  
42:44	"So you'd want to collapse that and then any between the the details on this version with the two tabs versus the PDFI know you had mentioned with the PDF there, there might be an opportunity to see more information."  
43:02	Any further thoughts about trust of one versus the other?  
43:11	"No, feel the same about both."  
43:14	"OK, got it."  
43:16	"And let me have you tap on payments on the lower right, on lower right."  
43:23	"Oh, sorry."  
43:23	"At the very, very bottom on the lower right."  
43:27	OK.  
43:27	"Oh, the the yeah, yeah, yeah."  
43:29	Perfect.  
43:30	All right.  
43:30	And so I'm just going to have you compare once more a tap into the overpayments section.  
43:36	OK.  
43:37	So this is again same information in this pretend scenario of the multiple debts that you have from a benefit overpayment.  
43:46	"If you want, you can look into the detail."  
43:48	I think just that top on the details are connected.  
43:50	"But any further thought on when you want, might want to just look into the overpayments versus the version with the multiple tabs of flipping back and forth between copay and overpay."  
44:05	"Oh, I don't, I don't."  
44:10	"Well, I think like I said, going back to the, you know, just kind of based on what's happening will be the only instance that I would hey, look over and one or the other base or if I'm alerted to do so."  
44:22	"But so this is just only the overpayments, correct or payments in general."  
44:28	"OK, OK."  
44:31	Yeah.  
44:31	"Well, I think it's just being what what I'm looking at and what I'm trying to look for at the time that I'm going to that I'm on the site."  
44:40	"Oh, sorry."  
44:41	Can you say that again?  
44:42	"Just like when, when you might want to choose one versus the other."  
44:45	"Oh, yeah."  
44:45	"So it's just based on what I'm doing, what I'm looking at or what I'm being prompted to, to do."  
44:50	"Oh, OK."  
44:50	"So it's it, it's more like what what you're what you're being prompted to look into at the time."  
44:56	Yeah.  
44:57	"OK, got it."  
44:59	And then tap into scroll up just a little bit.  
45:03	Yeah.  
45:03	"Let's tap into the review details for that top, top deck just so you can have a look at what this looks like."  
45:10	"And again, just any any further thoughts on looking at the information in this view versus the view with the two different tabs of flipping back and forth?"  
45:23	"No, this looks good."  
45:24	"Actually, it's my current balance, the original balance paid and it gives you my transaction history."  
45:35	"Yeah, I know this looks good."  
45:38	OK.  
45:38	And then how about any thoughts of this view right here of just the details for only the overpayments versus when you might want to look if if at all the the PDF of everything laid out of both the co-pays and the overpays?  
46:03	"No, I think it would just be again, based on what I'm looking at and if I just get something in the mail, just comment well."  
46:09	"And again, based on if I'm paying paying down that particular debt at the time, if I know I need to go ahead and get that done due to the time, then I'm just going to go straight to that."  
46:19	"Oh, like like straight to into the, the, the specific bill or debt you have to pay."  
46:23	"Yeah, Especially if I haven't like spent on my, you know, calendar."  
46:26	"Hey, I'm going to do this particular thing or this is all due by that time."  
46:30	"So it would definitely be according to what I'm managing, how I'm planning my, you know, to utilize the live to pay."  
46:39	"OK, So if you, if you have a specific debt or bill you're trying to pay."  
46:43	"Yeah, yeah."  
46:44	OK.  
46:44	"And then how about times that you might want to look at everything together, like like in the PDF would be so say, if there's something that came up that I wasn't aware of, then I would need to check, say something something that you know, came up out of the unexpected."  
47:00	"OK, got it."  
47:03	"And then thoughts on so knowing that we're just in the overpayments and let's say you, you know, you were alerted somewhere else about something else that you had to pay and you did want to look at that the PDF of the combined statement."  
47:21	Where would you expect to find that information of both the all of your co-pays and overpayments in one location?  
47:30	"Oh, that's a good question."  
47:34	"Well, in the combined, I mean it, I guess in the sexual man, that is a good question."  
47:39	"Because I think going back to what we were looking at with just the co-pay and the payment and the overpayments, but then the combined statement would have everything."  
47:47	So I'm assuming it would be in the combined payments.  
47:50	I'm trying to make sure I'm capturing every both of the two.  
47:54	"Yeah, they're there."  
47:57	"So like if you were on this screen now in just the overpayment, can you walk me through where you would expect to to to go to find that combined statement?"  
48:07	"OK, let's see."  
48:08	"So because this is just the overpayment, so I would have to go out of this screen to go to my combined statement here to see everything."  
48:23	OK?  
48:24	Yeah.  
48:25	"Because if I'm just again, if these are just drilling down into these specific ones that excuse me, then I'll have to if I want to see everything, then I want to make sure I need to go back some."  
48:32	"I don't expect that it would be in one would be any of in the other because of you know, it would be designated to each of the individual hearings."  
48:43	"OK, alright."  
48:44	So you would you you would expect to have to go somewhere else to find it.  
48:48	"Yeah, if that's if it's if it's make creative design that way, sure."  
48:52	OK.  
48:53	And so how knowing that you had to do just that of leave the overpayments and then go into this section to find combined statement.  
49:01	"Thoughts on how that might be, how how that is structured?"  
49:05	"Oh, yeah."  
49:06	"Maybe put like a link to the combined statement somewhere at the bottom to oh, like like on this page here."  
49:12	Yeah.  
49:13	OK.  
49:14	Or in the overpayments as well.  
49:16	OK.  
49:17	So a faster way to get there from each of the individual ones.  
49:21	Got it.  
49:22	"OK, got it."  
49:27	And let's see are there.  
49:30	I think we're about done here.  
49:33	I'm just looking at my notes.  
49:35	"I'm going to check in with my colleagues, Michelle, Denise, Janelle, if there are specific questions you would like to ask, you're welcome to unmute and ask that now."  
49:47	Just looking at my notes here.  
49:54	"Yeah, Michelle, hey, thank you."  
49:56	"I'm, I'm going to excuse me, go back to the very beginning when you made a comment about, you know, being interested in alerts or notifications about co-pays, you know, via text or e-mail."  
50:10	"And I'd love to hear more about that because it, it feels like it like you need to hit the sweet spot right on frequency."  
50:18	"And so I'd be interested to know what would I guess earn or deserve an alert for you, You know, is it an over?"  
50:30	Is it a past due?  
50:32	"Is it a brand new, you know, just to prevent you from getting more things than you would actually want."  
50:37	It's just mainly the new in the past due will be helpful to me.  
50:41	"Honestly, would those would be the freak because I like to know."  
50:46	"OK, here."  
50:46	"This is what you just came in into my, you know, into my into there."  
50:52	"And then that's already age that's say, hey, this is due by this time."  
50:56	"And even if there's a way to maybe like before it's due maybe a couple days prior, like, Hey, you have a bill that's about to be due, you know, double check it."  
51:04	"But definitely when it prompted me to know that it's there, it just came in."  
51:09	"And then you can give me that prompt to tell me to tell me that, hey, this is due becoming due."  
51:15	"And then even after it's due, I know that may be a little a little excessive, but but just that notification for me is really important."  
51:22	"And even on my phone, if I get like the more banner notification that it's been that something's there would help me."  
51:29	"And then then maybe even after 30 days, like, Hey, you haven't reviewed."  
51:32	If I haven't seen it or I haven't reviewed it.  
51:35	"Hey, don't forget a reminder."  
51:37	"Don't forget you have a pending, you know, bill that you need to review or overpayment that you need to review, because I, I mean, I'm, I haven't been on my phone."  
51:46	"So I'm just trying to make sure that I don't miss anything, you know, in my e-mail."  
51:49	So just one as soon as maybe simultaneously an e-mail and a a notification helps me a whole lot.  
51:58	Perfect.  
51:59	Thank you so much for that extra info.  
52:01	I appreciate it.  
52:01	"Of course, of course."  
52:04	Great.  
52:04	"And is there anything else to make sure See, Denise does not have any questions."  
52:09	"But yeah, are there anything else that you'd like to share about managing finances within the sorry VA?"  
52:18	Could be on the app or could be anything on the website that you have not already shared?  
52:23	"No, I think I've have some more exploring to do."  
52:25	"I've been looking at different things in different areas, but I'm, you know, interested in what's new."  
52:30	"So I'm just going to, you know, think I have some more, some more research to do too as well."  
52:33	This gives me some more that I need to potentially download the app as well to see if there's something that I can look at to help me better my different areas of my life.  
52:43	Yep.  
52:43	"Well, we're always looking at making the app more, more useful for everyone."  
52:47	So hopefully that can provide use for you as well.

52:55	"It's so important for us to be able to talk directly with veterans, understand experiences and understand just how we can make the tools better."
