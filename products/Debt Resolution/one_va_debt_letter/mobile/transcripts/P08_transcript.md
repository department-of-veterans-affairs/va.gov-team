## **Transcript: P08**

0:01	OK.  
0:02	"Now that we are recording, are you OK if I record our audio and visual as we talked today?"  
0:08	"Yes, I am."  
0:09	All right.  
0:09	And would you OK with potentially having some clips shown of the session to our VI partners also?  
0:16	OK.  
0:16	Thanks.  
0:17	Great.  
0:17	Thank you.  
0:19	"So first, I'd like to know at whatever level you are comfortable with, a bit about yourself as a veteran could be what branch you served and when you retired or separated."  
0:29	OK.  
0:30	"I joined the military in 1983, a long time ago."  
0:35	I served until 2015\.  
0:38	Most of that with the \[redacted\].  
0:44	So 83 to 2015 in uniform.  
0:48	"Got it, got it."  
0:49	And then what?  
0:50	How have you been involved with Veteran Affairs overall since 2015?  
0:57	"Well, I enrolled in VA healthcare in 2010 after \[redacted\]."  
1:10	"So just to, to get the, the medical care related to that at that point."  
1:15	"OK, got it."  
1:17	And then how about any experience you have with the VA website and the mobile app?  
1:23	"Oh, I, I like to think of probably use them at this point in my life almost daily."  
1:27	"So, got it."  
1:30	What can you tell me what you specifically use the app for?  
1:35	"Well, I use the app primarily for communicating with my providers, scheduling appointments, modifying appointments, renewing medications, and general communication about anything that that hasn't transpired yet."  
1:53	"OK, And can you tell me more about why you choose to use the app for those things as opposed to being on the website?"  
2:02	"The app is easier from the standpoint of course, traveling, I always have a phone."  
2:06	"I don't always have a a laptop, but especially I'm not employed anymore."  
2:10	"But when I was employed, I was in a situation where laptops weren't allowed and so on and so forth."  
2:15	So only system I would have was my is my cell phone.  
2:19	"So I would have to be able to do that on a break or step out, step out of the office and and do it in the hallway or something."  
2:24	"But basically just for convenience, but it became the primary means of communicating."  
2:31	"So OK, got it."  
2:32	Great.  
2:33	"And then again, at whatever level you're comfortable with, let them know."  
2:37	Any experience you've had with benefit overpayments?  
2:42	"Well, I've never been overpaid, so I haven't had a whole, but I do, I do know how to check for payments."  
2:48	"I know how to check for the where, where the payments are."  
2:52	I'm up at this point \[redacted\] disabled that.  
2:54	"So of course monitor pay, it took a while to get \[redacted\], you know, So we incremented to the to the to the 0% disabled to the \[redacted\]"  
3:05	"So it was a long road, a long haul."  
3:07	So it did take some time and learning and energy.  
3:10	So I believe I was fully vested in using the tools that were provided to us.  
3:16	"OK, got it."  
3:17	And how about any experience with with medical co-pays?  
3:22	"Yeah, of course I used the medical co-pays before I was \[redacted\]"  
3:26	I think I used them all the way up until I was 40%.  
3:29	I don't remember there's a percentage in there where that stops.  
3:32	"But I did use those for for for quite some time or use those, comply with those, pay them, all of that stuff."  
3:38	So got it.  
3:39	OK.  
3:40	"So when you were receiving co-pay bills, do you recall how you learned about whenever you had one that you had to pay?"  
3:48	"Yeah, initially, I don't think the app was developed at that point."  
3:53	"That was a receiving the, I don't remember if you call them ELBS or NLB notifications of benefits or explanations, but the they came physically in the mail at first."  
4:06	"OK, and then I believe I opted into then I opted into paperless and everything was really been paperless since then and that's been a number of years."  
4:15	So I've been paperless for a long time.  
4:16	So.  
4:17	"OK, got it, got it."  
4:18	"And so whenever you did receive these, these copay bills, did you always know they're coming?"  
4:24	Were they ever a surprise?  
4:26	"No, I think I always knew they were coming."  
4:27	"I, I, I'd just like you."  
4:30	I've been for 30 years of my life as well.  
4:33	So the federal government also used like insurance policies.  
4:38	"So we've, I've been used to receiving EO BS and whatever the terminologies, you know, the after appointments notifications and stuff like that and some type of communication with my provider."  
4:50	So it wasn't really new to me.  
4:52	What was new was using it on an app that was readily accessible.  
4:56	"So, OK, got it."  
4:58	"And whenever you did receive the bills, they said it was, it was, it was not a surprise."  
5:04	Was it always clear about what exactly they were for?  
5:09	I believe so.  
5:11	I've always relied on a calendar and my appointments and other things.  
5:16	"So the first thing I do when I get any bill, of course, I go to my calendar to see if that actually took place in the actual given date and back in the day compared to my \[redacted\]  record, to see what they paid versus what needs to be paid."  
5:28	"And, and yeah, so I, I've always been, I want to say anal,"  
5:33	"I've always aware of all the moving parts and, and been able and been able to track them."  
5:38	"So yes, OK, got it."  
5:40	And was it always clear what your next steps had to be in terms of any options for repayment or or anything else whenever you receive the bills?  
5:49	I think the documentation's been clear for quite some time.  
5:53	"I recall using years ago an online patience that had really nothing to do with the VA, but the VA was a choice in the listing."  
6:01	As I recall at one point it was a a government pay system of since were VA and it links to your your user ID which last four was our name and last four much like the V8.  
6:15	But I don't remember what that system was called.  
6:17	"But I remember using that for quite a while before it had an online VAVA pay system, government pay or something like that."  
6:25	Gov pay.  
6:25	I think it was Gov pay.  
6:26	"OK, got it."  
6:28	"All right, so now I'd like to talk about times that you're actively managing bills and payments and debts."  
6:36	And this could be like your overall financial situation.  
6:39	"And when I say manage, this could be anything from making a payment to a bill or maybe if you have to call someone for help or looking through statements, things like that are there."  
6:51	Talk to me about when you're doing that sort of things.  
6:54	And that could be like a day of the month or time of the week or physical location.  
6:59	Like when when are you typically managing your finances?  
7:02	"Well, I've had bills my entire life at this point."  
7:04	I'm in excess of 60 years old.  
7:06	"So I've of course raised a family and had had a \[redacted\], had a mortgage, had all that stuff for majority of my life, of course."  
7:12	So that's always been a thing.  
7:15	"So, but physically, when do I do it?"  
7:17	That's usually downtime for me.  
7:19	"That's always been like a, a Friday or a Saturday away from work back in the day and everything came by snail mail."  
7:26	"You know, the mail would pile up."  
7:27	"I, I, I read it, sort it and maybe sort it by Friday and, and read it all by Saturday and, and start to getting checks or sending checks or whatever was appropriate at the time."  
7:38	So it's always been a methodical process.  
7:42	"I probably learned in the military from everything to us was was clear, methodical and had a time and a place and a good flight."  
7:51	Yeah.  
7:51	And how about so you said what do you do in like downtime?  
7:56	What usually prompts you to to take any action that you need to with your finances?  
8:03	"Well, I don't like having bills first, so they they need to be paid, they need to be scored a week."  
8:12	"I know that hasn't it's fairly easy nowadays, especially now that I'm \[redacted\] disabled."  
8:17	They I don't really pay Co face.  
8:18	"But for our time when I had a family with the you know, the \[redacted\] and I had \[redacted\] kids in the house and and multiple co-pays for them and what they've done and different percentages and depending on what the that was extreme."  
8:29	"I recall that being a pretty extreme nightmare for a number of years, you know, coordinating with the \[redacted\]."  
8:35	Why did we do this?  
8:36	What was the other options?  
8:38	Did you pay them?  
8:40	You know something when you were there?  
8:42	Is this bill right?  
8:43	"I mean, it, it wasn't quite as easy just because of the I guess because of the mass I had more volume with, with the \[redacted\] and children."  
8:51	"So, but I think the process has been the same."  
8:54	It's just dealing with the volume was the only issue.  
8:56	"So, OK, got it."  
8:58	"So yeah, are are there like do do you know, do you know what would would cause you to actually sit down and, you know, figure things out or or or make payments?"  
9:09	Was it something you received in the mail or was it do you have a certain time like date every month you would do things?  
9:15	"Yeah, for me, I was a military and civil service for many years and even before we came bi weekly paid, I think we were all, we were all paid initially on the 1st and the 15th."  
9:25	So those became the queue dates.  
9:27	So the first and the middle of the month and end of month.  
9:29	So those were kind of key sit down moments to to go through the the pile of bills or go through anything that was outstanding to include things to be scheduled in the future as well.  
9:40	So not just past activity.  
9:43	"OK, got it."  
9:44	"OK so it it says that sounds like it was meant mainly the timeline, the first in the middle of the month."  
9:49	"Any, any anything else that might have prompted you to do any financial management maybe paper as it came in the mailing as bills piled up, so to speak in the in the at the end of the table."  
10:02	"So, yeah, just whatever seems urgent and of course having a family, you know, and sometimes we we were in control of our urgency."  
10:09	"You know, where they all going back to school and now we have, you know, \[redacted\] back to school physicals and sports physicals and all this other stuff sometime that was just dictated by by time everything I situation."  
10:23	"OK, got it."  
10:25	And any other thoughts on any methods that you have had over the over the years to make sure that that the things are being paid on time?  
10:37	"Well, I like to think that I, I paid my bills on time."  
10:40	"You know, I didn't sit past I might have waited the the 1st 15 days first, the 15th, but never more than 30 days between the, you know, the 1st and 2nd or the the 1st and the 15th of the of the following months."  
10:51	"So using that methodical method and keeping track of of of things on my calendar, I'm pretty anal when it comes to filing."  
11:01	"Back in the day, of course, I had a physical file cabinet in the house and it had had everything in it by by by date."  
11:08	I think even at one point I used Julian date.  
11:10	"But now I just use calendar and now, now I physically get everything digitized and I, and I scan it into Google Drive."  
11:17	"And if it still comes in paper, I scan it and upload it."  
11:19	"So now it goes into a, a, a Dr."  
11:23	someplace.  
11:23	"So it's, it's digitized, but it's really the same process."  
11:26	It's just digitized versus paper.  
11:28	"OK, got it."  
11:32	"And is there anything that you find or maybe recently or passed or now that you find challenging in terms of keeping track of, of anything that that needs to be paid for a time and still can be challenging when you receive multiple bills, For instance, you go to a doctor and, and while you're in the hospital, you go to the hospital."  
11:55	"I'm sorry, go to the hospital."  
11:56	"While you're there, you see a doctor, you see a specialist, you see somebody who gives you medication and you see someone who comes in and gives you counseling."  
12:03	And all those bills come in separate at some point.  
12:08	That was very confusing.  
12:09	"You know, why do I get 6 bills for one visit?"  
12:11	"You know, people I don't recall, ever seen people I don't recall were talking to, but all of a sudden they got to pay them."  
12:16	So those type of things were very confusing.  
12:18	I don't think they happen as much as they used to.  
12:21	"But to answer your question, that was that was a challenging time and that was probably more prevalent."  
12:28	"OK, got it, got it."  
12:31	"And is there anything that might make things easier, especially when looking at at multiple different, different bills and debts from, from a coordination of care, a coordination of care as pertains to a specific activity, You know, so I think you guys have gotten better now and I forget what the term is."  
12:50	It's something to do with the surprise billing or something.  
12:53	"So when I go in for an activity now hospital for instance, they give me a bill and then they also give me this no surprise billing thing saying the way I read that means I'm not going to get any surprise bills if I don't see it upfront or see it soon."  
16:06	Hello not able to hear you yet in case there's something on your end.  
16:21	"Oh wait there we go wow, that was crazy there we go you're back Hooray gotta love technology sometimes right, Maybe another fine point there I was on my home computer and and I can't get connected so back to my mobile app or my phone and now it's working fine."  
16:37	So I'm perfect.  
16:40	"Well, I actually wanted you on the mobile phone anyway, so this worked out just fine."  
16:47	"All right, so let me just pick up."  
16:52	"I know you were in the middle of of oh, looking at you looking at, at at information from a few different sources at once about like is if there is anything that could be made easier."  
17:05	I know you talked about like with the the healthcare of of combining things.  
17:11	"Any, any, any anything else to add about things that could be made easier when there's multiple, multiple bills and or debts from places."  
17:19	"No, I think those have been resolved now again, what we call the no surprise bill anything."  
17:23	"I don't know that the state thing, but that at least that's been resolved for me personally."  
17:27	"So mm hmm, OK, got it."  
17:30	"OK, so let me have you go ahead and share your screen."  
17:34	We're going to move into the prototype section.  
17:37	Let me know if you need help sharing your screen from the phone Share from image document web screen.  
17:46	OK screen.  
17:47	Yep.  
17:52	"Hey, is it sharing?"  
17:53	Not yet.  
17:54	I'm still just seeing your name.  
17:56	Let me try that again.  
17:59	I'm going to share screen.  
18:12	I'm looking at a menu.  
18:15	"Oh, you might have to select zoom."  
18:17	See if if you Scroll down to the bottom.  
18:19	I believe that's what you need to allow.  
18:23	OK Zoom was not allowed at that point.  
18:25	So share specific app share entire screen.  
18:31	"Yeah, share entire screen."  
18:33	Share screen now there we go Yep.  
18:35	Screen this is it.  
18:37	Perfect.  
18:38	"OK, so were you you were able to download Figma on your phone?"  
18:43	Yes.  
18:43	"OK, great."  
18:44	"So let me have you go and and oh, I'm sorry, we're not actually sharing yet."  
18:50	So can you try doing the share once more?  
18:55	I don't.  
18:56	What have we?  
18:57	"Oh, no, no, no, you are sorry."  
18:58	"This is just no, my, my bad."  
19:00	It was just a different view that I was used to.  
19:02	You're fine.  
19:03	That was me.  
19:03	Sorry.  
19:04	"All right, let me have you open up the Figma app on the phone and I'm going to get you to a test account to log in."  
19:20	"All right, so Yep, Yep, click on that."  
19:24	"OK, so under you can opt out at the bottom is fine."  
19:29	There we go under e-mail.  
19:35	"OK, yeah, so tap it."  
19:36	"All right, So the e-mail address is going to be VA test 000 at gmail.com, right?"  
19:54	"And then the password, it's a bit of a long one, but it is a pattern."  
19:58	So hopefully it'll be relatively easy to type capital A and then everything else will be lower case ZSX DC.  
20:15	"FV GB Oh, sorry."  
20:18	FV That was going on the next one.  
20:23	Yes.  
20:24	Yeah.  
20:24	OK.  
20:25	2468\.  
20:32	"OK, Log in."  
20:33	Yep.  
20:33	Log in.  
20:37	Yep.  
20:38	Continue with mobile app.  
20:39	"All right, give it just a moment, OK, We don't."  
20:46	You can just tap outside of that and you can tap not now there.  
20:53	OK.  
20:53	And then I am going to send you a link within Zoom.  
20:58	So you'll have to switch back to Zoom.  
21:07	"Yeah, right there."  
21:08	"And I think you'll have to scroll to swipe right once or twice or, or actually just just tap in the middle of the screen and actually go back one to the."  
21:22	"Yeah, there we go."  
21:23	So tap in the middle of the screen.  
21:25	"And yeah, we want to get to the chat button at the very bottom."  
21:33	Yeah.  
21:33	So just.  
21:34	"Yeah, there we go."  
21:35	And then tap once on that very long URL and that should open up Figma.  
21:44	There we go.  
21:44	It's coming.  
21:46	Great.  
21:46	That was pretty quick.  
21:48	I love it.  
21:48	"All right, so in this situation, we are going to pretend I should be back up."  
21:54	So I know I said you have not had any benefit overpayments.  
21:57	Do you know what benefit overpayments are?  
22:00	Yes.  
22:01	"OK, great."  
22:02	"So in this situation, we are going to pretend that you do have benefit overpayments from some disability and education benefits."  
22:10	"Also, we're going to pretend that you have some medical co-pays from regular doctor visits and prescriptions."  
22:17	So this is a representation of what really a part of the app looks like.  
22:23	"You wouldn't see exactly this within the app, but so pretending that you have both benefit overpayments and co-pays, let me know your thoughts on when you think you might want to look at each of those individually, meaning the co-pays or the overpayments as opposed to what do you want?"  
22:42	Might want to look at everything together.  
22:45	"Well, I want to look at them separately."  
22:47	"I want to know what the, because it says 2 co-pay bills, but it doesn't say how it's divided if you know it's the 50 or 25."  
22:52	"So I just, I feel inclined to click that just to look at that and it says 3 over payments again."  
22:58	So those are going to be 3 different amounts.  
22:59	I also feel inclined to check out and see what those three things are.  
23:05	So am I free to do so?  
23:07	"Actually, let me have you go to."  
23:10	We'll have you tap into in just a moment.  
23:13	"Any further or I guess are there, are there, are there any times that you think you might want to see everything together?"  
23:21	I like having that idea there.  
23:23	"Yeah, maybe that's an overview start."  
23:28	"Yeah, there's probably some utility to that as well."  
23:32	"Just being here, being here for the first time."  
23:34	"I guess I the, the more I went into it, I would, I would know by myself what I need to do."  
23:38	"But since this is kind of like my first time looking at all three of them, once I do it once, I think I'll, I mean, I'll soon learn what I need to do in the future."  
23:48	"OK, got it."  
23:50	"So let me have you tap into where it says combined statements and we'll we'll look at the other two in just a moment, but Scroll down through this."  
23:57	"So again, this is pretending that you have a couple over benefit overpayments plus some co-pays."  
24:04	"Yeah, scroll through this and let me know thoughts about what you're seeing, what might be useful, what is not useful, anything like that."  
24:23	I'm a little bit confused by looking at this because I see multiple amounts and the initial page I saw on \#3 and I think I saw I saw two number 3333 for co-pays and three for other bills.  
24:34	"But just going through this, I see initially 123456789."  
24:40	I think I saw 9 total.  
24:42	"So, so just just just by scrolling, I was kind of confused as to that."  
24:48	Now I have to dive into a deep to see why I'm seeing 9 payments as opposed to the expected 6\.  
24:56	OK so the the numbers aren't lining up and that's confusing.  
24:59	Good to know.  
24:59	"OK, any other thoughts on what you're seeing here?"  
25:03	Resolving your co-pay bills?  
25:04	So it's kind of cool.  
25:05	Looks like it gives me a way to review and resolve it on the spot.  
25:08	That's a plus.  
25:11	It seems intuitive enough.  
25:12	"I know by looking at descriptions and not specifically billing, reference means nothing to me."  
25:18	"That probably means something to the system, but the description seems intuitive enough."  
25:26	"OK, so it's showing a history."  
25:28	So somebody made a payment.  
25:29	I don't know who made that $35 payment.  
25:35	Yeah.  
25:35	So there's payments in there and references previous balance and amounts and amounts and amounts.  
25:44	"I'm, I'm not really tracking if these amounts are outstanding or are these current bills?"  
25:51	I'm I'm not sure what these are.  
25:53	"OK, got it."  
25:53	So that's not clear.  
25:54	"OK, I'd have to click in and see what they really are."  
25:57	So I go to the bottom.  
25:58	I see a total of 50 due.  
26:00	"But again, I saw a \-40 A plus 10A plus 10A plus 10A plus 10A plus 10A plus 40."  
26:08	So all the pluses exceed the the 50 due to me by by just a cursory view.  
26:17	"So just because I don't know if these payments were outstanding or made looks like if they have a negative sign, that means that it's a dual and if it's a positive number, it's a current bill possibly."  
26:35	OK.  
26:36	"So that's not clear, OK."  
26:42	How about anything in the benefit overpayment section?  
26:46	"OK, Overpayments."  
27:00	"Yeah, I think it's cool to see that you know, the negative numbers versus the positive numbers."  
27:05	"And then I'm assuming at the bottom is going to give me a total and that's, and if I sat down and did the math on all these lines that's supposed to match, but I guess I'm not even there yet."  
27:13	"So, so, so am I to assume that all those add up and that math is correct?"  
27:21	My anal mind is not going to allow me to do that.  
27:24	"OK, got it."  
27:26	"What would, what would make it helpful?"  
27:29	"Or I would, I would expect to maybe see a running balance if that's in fact what this is designed to do."  
27:34	"If it's supposed to be a, a, a a current past, future billing or current, current or past, I guess it is because they're they there are there, they appear to be newest on top, oldest on bottom."  
27:49	Let's see 2025 S Yeah.  
27:51	So there is some type of logical order.  
27:53	So it would be easy to put a running balance on there I would think.  
28:01	OK.  
28:03	"And then so you mentioned you'd want a running balance you'd want, you mentioned you wanted more details about what exactly the numbers mean and like who paid it, things like that."  
28:15	Are there other things here that would make it useful for you?  
28:19	Yeah.  
28:20	"So so again, what what I would do, I see something on there, for instance, anything June 5th, a balance decrease."  
28:27	"I'll look at my calendar and I'll say, well, I didn't pay that."  
28:29	So who paid that 100?  
28:30	Was that paid by insurance that paid by a third party carrier?  
28:33	"Again, it doesn't give me enough information at all to tell me how that was done."  
28:36	So some of these I'm going to assume I'm going to go to my calendar.  
28:38	I'm going to say on July 1st I made a $15 payment because that was a Co payment.  
28:42	"But I would possibly have a way to understand some of these, but without a a more explanation as to where the payment came from, It's it's it's going to throw me for a loop."  
28:54	"OK, So you just want more detail in it."  
28:56	OK.  
28:56	"Yeah, more detail."  
28:57	Where'd the payment come from in that?  
28:59	Right.  
28:59	OK Where'd it come from?  
29:01	Any other things that would make this more useful and helpful for you?  
29:06	Yeah.  
29:06	"So a more intuitive balance, a more, more explanation as to, to the, the amount as it pertains to the description."  
29:16	"I mean the description, you know, balance increase."  
29:18	"Well, I guess I can figure that out because it's a, because it's a A+ and the next one says balance decrease, duh, it's a minus."  
29:24	"So that seems use that field for something that's more more intuitive to what, what, what the the service is or maybe what the date was or who made the payment or OK, got it."  
29:40	Let me have you scroll to the top of this screen here.  
29:47	"What is your assumption looking at the, the blue download combined statement?"  
29:53	What would be your assumption on what that is?  
29:56	"Well, I'm guessing it's going to be a summation of everything below it."  
30:02	So it's going to be APDF of everything below it.  
30:06	"OK, yeah, let me have you go and go ahead and tap that."  
30:12	Thoughts on how this looks compared to what you were envisioning?  
30:16	"Oh, other than it's too small for me to read and I can't expand it."  
30:20	"That may that may be giving me what I'm looking for, but I can't really tell if it is."  
30:24	So if you that that's actually a prototype limitation.  
30:27	"If you tap once in there, it'll do a little magic if you will zoom so wonderful, wonderful."  
30:33	Yeah.  
30:33	It's just not something I was replicating the prototype.  
30:36	Perfect.  
30:36	"Yeah, that's exactly what I'd be looking for."  
30:38	"So yes, that that's providing me a lot more information than that."  
30:41	Than that.  
30:42	Yeah.  
30:42	The download summary is more comprehensive than looking at the the the previous page.  
30:46	So I like this.  
30:49	Can you say more about.  
30:50	"Oh, yeah, go ahead."  
30:51	Yeah.  
30:52	"It tells me that the drugs, the physician again, it it tells me exactly line by line what the charges are for."  
30:58	Yeah.  
30:58	It looks more like an an EOB at this point or an explanation of benefits or OK.  
31:04	"And can you see more, I know you said you this you like better than what we were just looking at say, say, say more about why you would prefer something like this versus the list you saw before."  
31:16	"I guess I'm OK with seeing the list before if it was just intended to be a summation, but it says, you know, to Click to download."  
31:24	Obviously what I'm clicking to download is not what I was looking at.  
31:27	"So what I'm what I'm looking at now is again, more intuitive."  
31:30	It has a great explanation.  
31:31	"It lines up dates to services and then also lines up services to a dollar amount and and and and the reference number, which means nothing to me but to someone's billing site, I'm assuming."  
31:41	"So this, this is much better from the respect of what it means to me, the the patient or the consumer or the bill payer."  
31:54	I don't know why these are in a multiple times balance decrease or increase.  
31:57	Are they supposed to be explained all the code?  
31:59	So this is a code.  
31:59	I get it.  
32:00	Yeah.  
32:01	So perfect.  
32:02	"OK, I'm only speaking for myself, of course, but this is the type of detail that I like."  
32:07	"Maybe some people don't like detail, but this is something that's helpful to me, something that that I would that I would download and in upload to my to my drive and have that as my documentation."  
32:20	So.  
32:21	"OK, got it."  
32:22	"So, yeah."  
32:23	"So, so it sounds like you would you would prefer this way of viewing things versus the list that we were seeing before."  
32:30	"Yeah, because that list tells me nothing."  
32:32	I'm going to have to Click to get to this anyway.  
32:34	"OK, got it."  
32:35	"And then then you said you would like with this PDF, you would most likely save it within your drive."  
32:42	Anything else you would do with it?  
32:44	"Well, of course, again, I I went through and I double checked against my, my personal calendar notes to make sure that that they really did line up with my appointments or my activity."  
32:56	That's my first thing.  
32:58	I'm assuming that that they will and they do.  
33:01	"At that point, I pay anything outstanding or schedule a payment and then file it."  
33:05	"And at when I pay it, I'll get a receipt, I'm assuming from a system."  
33:09	I'll also print that and file it in my same system.  
33:14	"OK, let me have you tap once on this screen."  
33:17	It'll get you back to the non zoomed and then tap the done at the top and then tap home at the very bottom.  
33:26	And we're going to look at briefly tap on the overpayments section there.  
33:34	"So this would be if you were just looking at the overpayments, It's actually, it's again, this is, you know, your, your pretend situation where all the, all the, the numbers are going to be the same."  
33:44	You still have the three different debts from the benefit overpayments.  
33:48	But thoughts on viewing just the overpayments here separately compared with what we were just looking at?  
33:55	And you can go into the details of any of them or I think just the top one is built out.  
34:00	I'm going to categorize this by we looked at three things.  
34:03	"We looked at the the initial screen, then I then I dove in and looked at the detail."  
34:08	And now I'm looking at this.  
34:11	"This is better than screen one because because it does give me, you know, what's expected of me."  
34:18	"Help me, you know, pay your balance now on requestable."  
34:21	"And it gives me, it even gives me a deadline."  
34:22	I didn't see that anywhere else.  
34:24	"So, OK, so I like, I like this as well, assuming I agree with all these debts."  
34:32	"I looked at that spreadsheet that we just looked at or, or that PDF we just looked at."  
34:37	I'm simply now more comfortable resolving the overpayment.  
34:43	"OK, yeah, this, this appears clean."  
34:45	I guess I can go into details.  
34:46	"But yeah, so given that it's pretty clean, I'm assuming when I click on details, it's going to give me a summation of what the how it went from zero to 1395 and what the overpayment is."  
34:56	"So, Oh yeah, if you want to click into the details of that, just that that top debt, the disability compensation, Yep, just to see and and original the current."  
35:07	"So I guess the discrepancies, the delta between the two, yeah, a lot, a lot of the buttons won't work."  
35:17	"Yeah, OK, Yeah."  
35:21	"So if the overt payments the dealt between the two, then that to me that seems logical."  
35:26	"OK, got it."  
35:30	Any any further thoughts on viewing the information here versus viewing both the overpayments and Co payments together as well?  
35:42	"Yeah, before, well, just spend a little bit of time on this one."  
35:44	"Just just you know, so again, I'm assuming logically I'm I'm looking at the original and I'm looking at a current."  
35:50	So then I guess it would be.  
35:53	So is the delta truly what I owe?  
35:56	Or I guess it doesn't even address the delta on this page at least it just says that current balance and original amount.  
36:04	So is it?  
36:06	So the original amount is something that was billed to me and now I have a current balance.  
36:09	So what happened to the delta that was that?  
36:11	Has that already been paid?  
36:12	Is that written off?  
36:13	What?  
36:13	Where's the delta?  
36:15	What?  
36:15	"Well, I'll turn that around."  
36:16	"What, like what information would you want to see to make to make sure that you fully understand everything about this debt?"  
36:23	"OK, so what's the difference between the 2400 and the 1395?"  
36:26	"It's a it's, it's a, you know, the, the, the, the missing, what is it?"  
36:31	The missing $605?  
36:35	"What, where where's that, where's that 605?"  
36:38	That that $605?  
36:41	"OK, so you, you want, you want to know why there's a difference between the current and the original?"  
36:45	Yes.  
36:47	OK.  
36:48	"And where, where might you expect on this page to find that information?"  
36:52	"Well, I think it could be easily in there."  
36:54	"I mean, I'm assuming I can, if it worked, resolve overpayment."  
37:00	"But I'm, I'm guessing that's just going to give me a way to make the payment."  
37:05	"But on this page it there, there appears to be room."  
37:08	"So it, it, you know, it could start with 2400 \-, 6 O 5, which was whatever it was."  
37:14	And our current balance is 1395\.  
37:15	"And that's what I owe, but it just seems it's missing something."  
37:20	"OK, so it's incomplete here."  
37:22	Got it.  
37:24	And let me have you go tap back onto the home button toward the bottom and then go back into a combined statement.  
37:32	Just want to review this and get any further thoughts.  
37:37	"So again, this is same information."  
37:39	We're just looking at both co-pays and overpayments.  
37:43	"Any, any further thoughts about information that you're viewing here compared with how you just viewed the overpayment section there in terms of what might be?"  
37:56	"In all honesty, if this was my personal record, I would recognize some of this stuff."  
38:00	And obviously I don't recognize it because it's not mine.  
38:02	"So, so, so we're at a disadvantage plane with notional data."  
38:15	"I would still like to see just something more descriptive than you know, balance increase, balance decrease."  
38:22	"I mean that obviously you have the space and seem like you're wasting that field for, for, for something that the number indicates if it's negative or positive."  
38:29	"So, OK, OK, how about any thoughts on let's say, if if you're, if you're needing to look at both the co-pays you owe and the benefit overpayments that you owe."  
38:42	Thoughts on seeing everything on one page like we're looking at right now versus the last version where you would need to go into overpayments as a separate section from the Co payments.  
38:59	"Again, if this was my real data and I came here on a regular basis, this, this would probably be much easier for me to understand."  
39:05	"But since it's not mine and also I'd have to fill in even if I was a, I'm assuming majority of your customers the US is in this are, are possibly even older and maybe not comfortable with technology as much."  
39:19	"So the more times I have to hit something more, more times I have to dive deep."  
39:23	"The more times you know that, that creates more confusion."  
39:26	"So having a, a clear summation at the very top, you know, the, the, the introductory page, your, your, your, your, your first page, whatever you want to call your splash page, there needs to be as comprehensive as possible."  
39:39	I'm thinking.  
39:40	"So if there is any wasted space or if there's wasted terms, I mean, those are the things that I think that can be streamlined or even pulled out."  
39:50	"OK, got it."  
39:51	How about any thoughts of how much you trust the information?  
39:57	Let's compare this page here where you're seeing all the copays and all the overpayments together versus the view you looked at previously where you were looking at the overpayments and the copayments separately.  
40:11	Any thoughts on which one you might trust more?  
40:15	"Well, I would tend to trust the one that we did the full download and that like the the PDF version off because it gave me because it gives me a full history."  
40:23	I'm the why it was 5000 why it you know why who made the payments why it's now 3000 whatever to to get me from the initial to what's currently owed so that that's OK.  
40:36	I don't know maybe you do have it right then if if people don't care about driving down.  
40:41	"That's just the way I wanted, but I'm not your only customer, of course, so OK, that's fine."  
40:50	"Yeah, let me have you tap on the home button."  
40:52	"Now at the bottom here, I'm going to get you to a different view."  
40:55	So now we're going to look at a design that's not yet anywhere on the app or the website.  
41:01	Let me have you tap into the future version B on the right hand side.  
41:08	Great.  
41:08	"So this is again, it's it's combining both the co-pays and the overpayments."  
41:14	"Click around here and yeah, have a look at all the sections."  
41:19	That's the first thing I noticed.  
41:20	"I mean, it has an at least now a tab that says copay one for overpayments on the exact same 1."  
41:25	So that that's an extreme plus alone a total due.  
41:35	I know who I went to.  
41:38	Where's the dates?  
41:39	"I don't see a OK, today's date."  
41:42	I don't a lot of times I'm more concerned with the date of service than than today's date.  
41:48	"OK, But if it's just a running balance of a bill, I guess there's no what date is tied to, it's just a running balance of the bill."  
42:01	So that I guess that could be OK.  
42:02	"OK, OK."  
42:08	I feel inclined to review and resolve co-pays.  
42:13	"OK, and how about if you're yes, let me know your thoughts on this way of seeing both the co-pays and the overpayments within this section?"  
42:27	"Well, again, I think that's an extreme plus just because they're they're again, they're they're presented to me upfront."  
42:31	So it's now my option to look at those.  
42:33	So I like having that option right there.  
42:36	OK.  
42:36	"And I'm assuming I can, you know, click it and then obviously click right back too."  
42:41	"So if that's functional when it gets functional, that's I see."  
42:44	I see that as an extreme plus than having the pages separate the way they were.  
42:48	"OK, Yeah, it it, it should be functional if you want to tap over to overpayments and you can go back and forth."  
42:53	"Yeah, there we go."  
42:54	"OK, Good."  
42:55	"Good, good, good."  
43:17	"Yeah, I'm not."  
43:20	I still like to see something that ties me to the the event.  
43:24	"I guess I can maybe when I dive in deeper, I can see the events and then the date that the event took place."  
43:30	"OK, where where would you expect to do that to?"  
43:34	"As you say, dive into the detail the the details."  
43:38	"Yeah, I suppose by looking at this overpayment, if I did the review and resolve it should be there, but obviously it's not working for me at this point."  
43:43	"But if it's there, that's that's great."  
43:45	OK.  
43:50	"And from here, is it clear like what, what the different debts are that you have under overpayments?"  
43:59	"Well, I'd have to, I'd have to dive into those and those links aren't working, but I'm assuming, OK, that one did work."  
44:04	Finally.  
44:04	What?  
44:04	Which one was that?  
44:06	"OK, so so we know it's a DIC"  
44:08	"So since we know it's a DIC payment, I'm assuming that's going to be the dollar amount against the indemnity, whatever DIC stands for."  
44:19	Forget that's on the level of detail that you're seeing here.  
44:34	"Again, I I like that there's a date associated with it."  
44:36	"So I can see my balance increasing and I can see the balance decreasing, but I don't see again, a, a, a running balance."  
44:44	"OK, not the running total."  
44:45	Got it.  
44:46	"OK, I suppose the, the whole object of this page does give me the running, but I have to but it's, it's it's a, a summation where I think it could be easy to to, to put it per activity or per date."  
45:01	"OK, So outside of the running total that you've mentioned, are there other things here that you think would be would make it more useful to you?"  
45:18	"No, I like, I like."  
45:19	I'm assuming that date is this service date and and not a print date.  
45:23	"So if that is, that's exactly what I'm looking for at least."  
45:26	OK.  
45:33	"And how about if you oh, go go ahead."  
45:35	And that must.  
45:36	"And to me, I'm gonna say all those dollar amounts really are just co-pays."  
45:38	So the the $15 increases are co-pays.  
45:43	I'm guessing so so so this is actually from benefit overpayment.  
45:47	"So there's no, yeah, this is like like indemnity payment of some sort."  
45:51	Yeah.  
45:51	"So I guess if I knew this, I would know what that was because I would be receiving DIC payments again."  
45:57	"Again, I have the disadvantage of looking at notional data that doesn't apply to me."  
46:01	So there.  
46:02	Sure.  
46:02	OK.  
46:07	And how about if you.  
46:08	"Oh yeah, go ahead."  
46:09	"I'm just going to say again, just other than like a running balance for someone like me, that that that's I I like this cleaner."  
46:16	"Look, it's got the date, it's got the amount."  
46:19	So.  
46:20	Mm hmm.  
46:21	"OK, got it."  
46:22	"And how about if you, how useful do you think it might be if you were say, having both benefit overpayments and co-pays in terms of just managing finances from a month to month basis?"  
46:40	"It's beneficial to me 'cause again, I don't like to owe money."  
46:42	So a place where I go and I see how much I do owe at any given time.  
46:48	"If I, if I'm, I'm going into the app, you know, once a month or once a week, whatever my time period is or the 1st and the 15th, I'd like to just go there and see the summation."  
46:56	"So, and this clearly gives me the opportunity to do that."  
46:59	"So OK, got it."  
47:02	And then tap on the scroll up to the top again and then tap on the view combined PDF statement.  
47:10	So this is going to be the same as we looked at before.  
47:13	But thoughts on a PDF that you've already looked at compared with the version that we just looked at a moment ago with the two different tabs of when you might use one or the other or if one seems more useful to you?  
47:30	"Well, I definitely like the tabs for for doing business, but but for my personal record filing, I love the PDF."  
47:37	"OK, so for filing."  
47:38	Got it.  
47:39	"So it sounds like you would use both, is that right?"  
47:42	Yes.  
47:43	"OK, got it."  
47:45	"All right, go ahead and tap done there."  
47:48	"I mean, it even makes sense in the sometimes in years past and, and and maybe future years there may be a tax benefit to itemizing benefits of the."  
47:58	So the payments need to be documented someplace.  
48:00	"So, OK, some more keeping it around for documentation."  
48:03	Good.  
48:04	All right.  
48:04	And then let me have you tap actually Scroll down to the bottom of this screen.  
48:10	"I'm going to get you to Yeah, combined statement A."  
48:14	Does anything jump out at you as being immediately different versus version B that we just looked at?  
48:22	"Well, obviously veteran information, I didn't see that before."  
48:24	"So OK, yeah, that's the only thing that's really jumping out is that right now."  
48:39	"OK, really just for time, I'll, I'll tell you the difference."  
48:42	"But if you Scroll down just a little bit below where it says co-pay bills and it says you're receiving this billing, billing statement."  
48:50	"Oh, scroll back up."  
48:55	"Yeah, right there."  
48:55	"So the, the, the explanation under co-pay bills, it's expanded here."  
49:01	And on the other version it was collapsed and so you're not seeing it right away.  
49:06	"So yeah, thoughts on that?"  
49:08	Would that be useful?  
49:09	Would it not be useful?  
49:12	I think that's very useful.  
49:13	It tells you right up front.  
49:13	I don't have to click in and it now I know what the total due is for.  
49:16	So.  
49:17	"Oh, so I'm sorry, not not the total, but where it's where it says you're receiving this billing statement because that section right there."  
49:24	"Well, then it tells me the total due."  
49:25	So it kind of even links to it.  
49:27	So right.  
49:28	So let me have you Scroll down to the very bottom.  
49:30	I'm just going to get you to version B so it's easier to see the difference.  
49:34	"Yeah, go ahead and click on B."  
49:37	Yeah.  
49:37	So right here.  
49:37	"So that that that rectangle where it says copay bills if you if you tap on the arrow or the little I, it should expand and show the yeah, right there."  
49:49	"OK, So it's really the same thing other than the other one shows that without having to hit hit the other."  
49:54	"Yeah, exactly the information."  
49:55	"So I think the explanation means enough to me that I shouldn't have to click the “i.”  
OK, so you you would want to always see that that explanation of why you receiving it."  
50:07	Got it.  
50:07	OK.  
50:10	And and let me have you tap on payments on the lower right.  
50:19	Let me have you go into co-pay bills.  
50:22	We're going to compare again looking at individual like just the co-pays versus the version with the two tabs.  
50:33	Just get for the thoughts on what is more more useful to you when you might use one versus the other.  
50:45	"Well, I would use this as well."  
50:47	I guess the thing that jumped out of me initially was just the last six months.  
50:51	Does this mean I could owe more or why is it just the last six months?  
50:57	"Would you again, I'll turn that around."  
50:59	It sounds like you would want to know more information about why it's just the last six months.  
51:03	"Well, is that all I owe or is that all you're showing me?"  
51:10	"All right, So it sounds like that that that needs to be clear about what?"  
51:13	What exactly that six months means or what's the intent of the six months?  
51:19	OK.  
51:20	If I owe you $100 and you're only showing me by looking at six months that I owe you 75?  
51:30	Yeah.  
51:30	Why is it tied to just six months?  
51:31	I suppose so.  
51:33	"OK, got it."  
51:33	You want to be more clear about that?  
51:35	Anything else like looking at just the co-pay bills compared with the version where you had the two different tabs of when you think you might use one versus the other?  
51:55	"The thing that bothered me about this again, is it it gives me today's date."  
51:58	"It doesn't tie it to the date of service, you know, tells me I must, I must pay it by something."  
52:03	"So, So me, I don't know what this is for."  
52:07	"OK, Tap the review details on that, that top one."  
52:11	"Yeah, again, due due date."  
52:16	So I have to dive in deep to find out what the service was for.  
52:19	"I mean, I can see when it's due, but when, when did I incur this charge?"  
52:24	Why do I even owe this charge?  
52:25	Let's see right there.  
52:26	So drugs billing statement.  
52:29	"OK, All right, So it's all there."  
52:31	That's good.  
52:38	"OK, good."  
52:40	Does that does that answer the things you would want to know you think?  
52:43	"Yeah, it answers my questions, yes."  
52:45	"OK, got it."  
52:49	So any and actually let me tap on have you tap on payments on the lower right again.  
52:56	"So again, looking at this page, seeing that the co-pay bills would be a separate section from the overpayments."  
53:03	Any Yeah.  
53:04	And any further thoughts on is that something you would prefer or do you like the version with the two different tabs on the one screen of the copay and overpay on one screen?  
53:15	That's a trick question.  
53:16	"So really my preference is the 2 tabs just because I, I, that just seems more logical to me, but it really says the same thing."  
53:22	It's just in a different format.  
53:23	"So, so like it's happening on the the combined statement."  
53:29	Yes.  
53:31	"OK, so yeah, go ahead."  
53:34	"Having the the two tabs is is more ideal for for me personally, which is really the same thing I'm looking at now."  
53:40	It just it this just I need to get to an appointment in 30 minutes that take me 5 minutes.  
53:56	"OK, so it it sounds like it's it's almost, almost the same thing then."  
54:00	"Yes, got it."  
54:02	"OK, great."  
54:03	I personally like the taps better.  
54:04	You like the taps.  
54:05	"OK, great."  
54:06	That is what I want to know.  
54:07	"All right, well, we are at times."  
54:09	"So I will not keep you and apologize for going a tiny bit late, but this has been really helpful."  
54:13	"Thank you for for chatting with us and sorry about the technical issues from before, but glad we got you back on."  
54:20	Always happy to hear that.  
54:22	"Yeah, so I know Para Jean is going to be reaching out to you with a thank you note and I hope you have a great rest of your day."  
54:31	I did want to interject a couple of other things.  
54:33	Yeah.  
54:34	Yeah.  
54:34	I didn't want to keep it.  
54:35	"Oh, yeah."  
54:36	"No, I'm."  
54:36	I'm fine on time.  
54:37	"So if you want to share anything else, please."  
54:39	"Oh, yeah, I'm on a cell phone."  
54:41	I can actually get in the car and drive if I have to.  
54:42	I suppose with that.  
54:46	"OK, let's see."  
54:46	Let's see.  
54:47	It was on the tip of my tongue.  
54:48	I was looking at the compensation.  
54:56	Dang it.  
55:07	"As it pertains to community care, I know that that community care kind of gets lost because we go in the community get that and we even go I have to go to \[redacted\] to get my community."  
55:19	So it's even though it's still is VAI have to go elsewhere to do that and it and it is it's very clunky.  
55:26	"So it's it's very clunky for me to to go to community care, send them the information and my PCP send the information."  
55:32	Then I just have to wait and wait and wait.  
55:37	"And I eventually I get this referral number, which gives me the authorization to seek the care."  
55:41	And then I get to what I'm looking at now.  
55:42	"Then, then, then, then becomes the treatment and the payments."  
55:45	"But there is no link between the community care system and the VA system, even though they're both called VA systems."  
55:54	"Oh, interesting."  
55:55	"OK, So it's just more more work for you if you're using."  
55:59	"Oh, yeah, I have to even go to, I have to go to different websites."  
56:03	"Oh, OK."  
56:04	"Yeah, that does not sound ideal."  
56:05	I agree.  
56:06	"Same thing, different passwords, different websites."  
56:09	"But I, I know you didn't talk about community care at all, but that that becomes an issue as well when it comes to the same thing that the co-pays the bills, it's those on the community care versus those internal to the VA itself."  
56:21	"OK, yeah, no, that makes sense to start."  
56:22	Certainly sounds frustrating and he's that was that.  
56:27	So thank you for your time.  
56:28	I appreciate you guys are doing a great job.  
56:30	I do like using all the Thursdays.  
56:31	I like to see them improved all the time.  
56:33	Just exactly like you're doing right now.  
56:36	Great job.  
56:37	Thank you.  
56:37	Yeah.  
56:38	All right.  
56:38	Thanks so much.  
56:38	Have a great day.  
56:40	Right.  
56:40	Blessings.  
56:40	Is this self killing?  
56:43	Yeah.  
56:43	"Yeah, I'm going to turn off."  
56:44	Thank you.
