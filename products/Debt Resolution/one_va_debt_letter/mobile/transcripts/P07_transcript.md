## **Transcript: P07**

0:01	Right.  
0:02	"So now that we are recording, are you OK if I record our video and audio as we talked today?"  
0:07	"Yes, ma'am."  
0:08	Great.  
0:08	And are you OK if I potentially share any clips with our VA partners from our session today?  
0:14	"Yes, ma'am."  
0:15	Great.  
0:16	Thank you.  
0:17	"OK so first just to start, I'd love to know at whatever level you are comfortable a little bit about yourself as a veteran."  
0:24	"Could be the branch you served when you were tired or separated, things like that."  
0:29	OK so my name is \[redacted\]  
0:33	I spent seven years in \[redacted\] from 1995 to 2002\.  
0:40	Graduated from high school \[redacted\] 6 days later I'm standing in \[redacted\].  
0:49	"After I separated from the \[redacted\], I immediately started working for the \[redacted\]"  
0:59	"And 15 years ago \[redacted\] is when I became a federal employee, and I have been at the \[redacted\] now for over 23 years."  
1:16	"Wow, so quite serious."  
1:19	"All right, thank you."  
1:21	And then so since since you separated what what sort of experience with Veteran Affairs have you had overall?  
1:31	Overall with the I would say this disability claims has been terrible and problematic.  
1:45	I would say that the Healthcare is mostly good.  
1:52	There have been some issues here and there.  
1:59	"Excuse me, there's been some issues here and there with attempting to schedule appointments that can be distant."  
2:09	"What I mean is I'm calling for the appointment and then they're like, Oh, well, we don't have anything for like 2-3, four months or whatever."  
2:16	"And then it can be problematic because the then it's OK, but we don't have an appointment for you quick enough."  
2:26	"So then we need to send you out to the community so that the Office of Community Care has to wait to get that information from, you know, the, the clinic."  
2:37	And then they have to do their thing.  
2:40	"And then it's like, OK, well, then I get a phone call, you know, within about 30 days saying, hey, we've got an appointment scheduled for you at this clinic at this time and your authorization is for this long of a period of time."  
2:57	So it's like that is faster than waiting the 3-4 months for the appointment.  
3:04	"But it's still just the pain in the butt that the, the hurry up and wait to even get a community care appointment."  
3:16	"And, and then, you know, sometimes the mileage claims are difficult, especially when it's a community care appointment, because it's, you don't, you can't use the regular VA website."  
3:34	"You have to go through BTSS to file the claim and then the address for the appointment goes to the VA hospital, in my case, \[redacted\]."  
3:49	"And then it's like, OK, well, now I got to change the address from where I drove to to where the appointment was."  
3:55	"And then it has to go with the manual review status, which can take weeks to months for that to get approved or denied."  
4:03	"And I have had some, some claims that were denied even though that they were community care appointments."  
4:11	"So, and as far as like sometimes co-pays, the co-pays that I have experienced have not been, you know, an enormous amount."  
4:32	"The issue the, the, it's typically been a problem."  
4:38	"Like it's like, OK, but what is this for?"  
4:39	"It's like, and then like, OK, you read it and it says date of service and it's 23456 months ago."  
4:46	"I'm like, Oh my goodness."  
4:47	"Well, like, what the heck?"  
4:51	"So then trying to figure out, you know, trying to figure that out was like, what, what, what was that appointment for?"  
4:58	"So, you know, and payment has been fine, you know, going through pay.gov make those payments."  
5:07	That's been absolutely perfect.  
5:09	I have never had any issues with that.  
5:13	"But it's just like date of service to getting the bill that has been like, OK, well, what the hell is this bill for?"  
5:22	"You know, and even though, you know, I, I had, I have, you know, third party insurance, you know, like reading, you know, then getting the, the explanation of benefits from \[redacted\], comparing that to what the VA is billing me for."  
5:40	"And then it's like, OK, well, you know, \[redacted\] says that, oh, for this medication, my co-pay should only be like $2.50."  
5:53	But then I get a bill for $20.00 for the same medication from the VA.  
5:58	"And so I was like, OK, well, now let me go through."  
6:02	"I got, I still got to pay the VA the $20.00."  
6:04	"I got to contact \[redacted\] like, hey, this is what he's like."  
6:08	"They're like, hey, you need to take that up with the VA, but this is all that you should be paying."  
6:15	"And so whether and then it's like, OK, well, whomever is doing third party billing at the VA, they're either they don't care or I don't know how they're doing it, but you know, they're charging more than what the than what I should be paying."  
6:36	"And it's not, that's not a huge complaint because my co-pays have only been for medication and it's been a few dollars here and there difference."  
6:49	"Because even though that, you know, I've had I've had multiple surgeries through the VA and you know, they go in and do the third party billing to \[redacted\]."  
7:02	"And you know, my co-pay for the year should have been something like insane whatever, like \[redacted\] dollars."  
7:16	"But I'm not, I don't get a bill for the procedures because the VA is like, OK, well we get what we get from the third, from the third party insurance for the procedure."  
7:26	"But all we billed, all they billed me for was medication."  
7:31	"So I'm like, OK, well that's fine."  
7:35	"I've had 123-456-7899 surgeries, \[redacted\]surgeries, so not receiving a bill for, for the medical procedure co-pays and anesthesia, surgeons fees and all of that stuff has been way that's, that's been so much better than me complaining about my Oh, well, this is only supposed to be $3 and not 15."  
8:11	"So it, it completely outweighs, you know, my little complaint about the medication cost."  
8:19	"Yeah, yeah, yeah."  
8:21	"So when you, I'd like to know more about not, not not too much, I don't need to two more details, but curious about when you're using the VA website and the VA app."  
8:34	"I know you mentioned like with travel pay, you're not able to use the website, you have to go somewhere else."  
8:40	"But back up, are you using the VA app for any, for anything, anything you're mentioning here?"  
8:47	Yeah.  
8:47	"So for the for the standard travel claims, I go through the VA app or website, that's fine."  
8:53	"But then, you know, it's like, and those are only for appointments like at VA facilities."  
8:59	"No, it'll have like my appointment that's out on the community."  
9:02	"And it says to file a claim with this, click this link to BTSS."  
9:07	"And so then it's like, OK, I can click the link either through the VA app or the website and it still brings up a, a, it brings up a separate browser to, to log into and then fill out the claim there."  
9:20	"OK, got it, got it."  
9:22	And are there are there specific times that you are specifically choosing to use the app as opposed to remaining on the website?  
9:31	"The app for me is just much more it's if I have to look for letters, if I'm looking for letters from the VA like for so that I can get my property tax discount as a disabled veteran."  
9:52	"If I'm looking to see what you know, the exact verbiage on a disability award or denial."  
10:04	"I go through the website, the last website."  
10:06	"OK, because it's so much easier to find the letters on the website than it is through the app."  
10:14	But I do 90% of my VA stuff through the app.  
10:24	"The other 10% is going to be through the website is the is looking for letters, printing the letters and it's really a 5050 mix on whether or not I message my provider through the app or the website or even apply request refills through the app or the website."  
10:47	"Oh, OK."  
10:47	"So Oh yeah, go ahead."  
10:50	So usually I use the website when I'm at work.  
10:56	I work four 10s \[redacted\].  
10:59	"So if I'm at the office, cell signal, data signal is hit or miss because I work in the basement of \[redacted\]"  
11:11	So I have tons and tons of steel and concrete all around me.  
11:15	"So that's what I'll use the, the website most often, but aside from that, you know, it's pretty much through through the, the mobile app on my phone."  
11:27	"Oh, OK."  
11:27	So is it like if?  
11:30	Yeah.  
11:30	"So if you're above ground, shall we say, so are you're, you're, you're mostly choosing to use the app."  
11:36	"And I'm curious like what, what, what, what is it about the app that makes it that that you prefer to do with the refills and the messaging, your provider and things like that?"  
11:45	"So when I log in through the app, I'm not, you know, it's like I'm, I have, I have my biometrics saved."  
11:52	"So it logs in through facial recognition and then it does not do a secondary authentication like with, with the website."  
12:05	"And then the navigation buttons are easier to find and they're, they're chumped down on the bottom."  
12:13	So you've got like your health and prescriptions and stuff like that.  
12:19	So then it's easier to find him that way.  
12:22	"Then like on the website, you log in, you're like, OK, where where I need to go to here to look at forms I need to go here to for medications, I need to go to another one to get to, to do to message my provider."  
12:35	So I think that the vast majority of the time using the app is easier for me.  
12:41	"OK, got it."  
12:42	"Great, So now I want to get a little more information about your financial situation."  
12:48	I know you've already mentioned the co-pays about the different different amounts and that that they often appear you said like months after something happened.  
12:58	"Yes, it'll it'll be you know, it's like I've never had one come in."  
13:01	I didn't.  
13:02	I've never had a bill come in like within a few weeks.  
13:06	It's always been at least a month to multiple months out.  
13:10	"OK, OK, got it."  
13:12	And are there?  
13:14	Is it always clear?  
13:18	I know you said it's not always clear initially what they're for 'cause it's so much later.  
13:22	"But like once you read through them, is it clear why you're getting that specific bill?"  
13:27	"Yes, yeah."  
13:27	"And it's, and like I said, it's never been for."  
13:30	It's always been for medication.  
13:32	I've never had a bill for a co-pay for any procedure that was done.  
13:37	"OK, good."  
13:38	"And when Oh, and how are you notified of, of the, the co-pay bills that you have?"  
13:45	"I get a letter in the mail, you know, address from the VA and I open it up and I'm like, oh, oh, OK, what's this for?"  
13:54	"You know, it may have one, it may have like 8."  
13:57	"You know, I, I've had one that was 3 pages long."  
14:02	"When I say 3 pages, you know, it doesn't have like every, the, the top quarter and then the bottom quarter is like standard VA gibberish."  
14:13	"And so the middle half will have all the have the, the medication and the fill dates and then the cost."  
14:21	"So I've had actually had three pages before because whomever in 3rd party billing just decided to wait and it wasn't, I want to say it was that the most highest bill that I've received was somewhere close to $200.00."  
14:42	So it's not been a terribly high amount.  
14:46	"It's just, you know, frustrating that, you know, it took 3-4 months or whatever to to get the bill in."  
14:54	"Yeah, OK, got it."  
14:55	"And so when you do get, when you do receive the bill, is it clear to you like what your next step is or what or what options are in order to, to resolve the bill?"  
15:07	"Yes, yes, absolutely."  
15:08	"So on the bill itself, it says you can call this number, make a payment over the phone, you can pay online."  
15:20	So yeah.  
15:21	And there is an option to mail in a check or money order.  
15:26	"But I've always done, I've done online payment 99.9% of the time."  
15:33	I had to do an over the phone payment once because pay.gov was not working.  
15:40	"And I was, I was like, I'm one of those sometimes I'm one of those people where it's like, OK, well they took their time sending me this bill."  
15:50	I'm going to wait till the day of to pay him.  
15:52	"And it's like, oh crap, pay.gov's down."  
15:54	"So let me call this number, let me call this number and and pay them so that I don't get hit with a with a late fee."  
16:02	"Sure, sure, yeah, got it makes sense."  
16:05	And is there any other communication that you receive regarding the bills beyond the the the letters that you receive?  
16:15	I don't I don't get notified except for through the mail.  
16:20	"But if I go on to the VA website, there is a place to look to see if you have government debt, but there's no notification of it."  
16:30	OK.  
16:30	"So, so, so you you have to actively go and."  
16:33	Yeah.  
16:33	OK.  
16:34	And then how about any experience you have with benefit overpayments?  
16:38	I have never received a benefit overpayment.  
16:41	"OK, Never have."  
16:42	Those are are you are you aware of what they are last that first?  
16:45	"Yes, I actually have a friend of mine who had a benefit overpayment."  
16:51	the VA did not remove his stepchildren for over 2 years and he received a bill for \[redacted\] for his two stepchildren.  
17:06	"Oh well, I hope he got that fixed resolved or something."  
17:10	"Yes, yes it was eventually resolved."  
17:12	"He, he appealed it and the VA did not, the VA dropped the case because it was their fault."  
17:23	"He called in and let them know and emailed all the, the divorce documents and everything and, and it was their fault."  
17:32	"So they, they were like, OK, all right, you win, keep the money."  
17:37	"But remember, starting on this day, you're going to we're going to be removing your with dependence pay status."  
17:46	"Yeah, Yeah."  
17:46	OK.  
17:47	"Well, I'm glad it was eventually resolved, but that does not sound like a fun, a fun initial bill to."  
17:52	"Yeah, yeah."  
17:53	"It's a get a letter in the mail saying, hey, you owe, you owe the government \[redacted\]"  
17:59	Yeah.  
18:00	I don't think I would like to get.  
18:01	I would like to get that.  
18:03	So talk to me about times that you are actively managing finances.  
18:08	"And when I say managing, I'm thinking of it pretty broadly."  
18:11	"So like if you like making phone calls or reading through any statements or making plans to pay, when do you have a certain time, maybe every month or every week or something that you're that you're actively managing finances?"  
18:27	Yeah.  
18:27	"So I have all my recurring bills in my Google Calendar set up with reminders, you know, at least a day before saying, hey, this, this bill is due on this day."  
18:45	So I'll go in and I'll take a look.  
18:46	"OK, well, that Bill's due this day."  
18:48	Let me see what other bills are due within a couple of days of that.  
18:53	"And then if I need to move some money around, I will, you know, I have a, I'm actually \[redacted\]"  
19:06	"So that's been an issue with, \[redacted\]"  
19:22	"And then so it's like I'm not going to keep a whole lot of money in this account that has, you know, that has bills coming out of it."  
19:32	So I will just keep a minimal amount in there and to make sure that the bills that I am responsible for get paid that I have not yet transferred to my account only.  
19:47	"So I'm in, I'm looking at it a couple of times a week."  
19:52	"Oh, you are OK, got it."  
19:53	And so is that.  
19:54	So does those.  
19:55	I know you said you like you add things into your calendar.  
20:00	Are you are you waiting like to be prompted from that?  
20:02	Or are you are you more actively looking at things a few days a week?  
20:07	What's your process for for used to?  
20:11	I will look at it.  
20:13	I'll get a prompt.  
20:15	I'll get my notification from Gmail and then I'll go in and I'll look and then I'll look to see what else is coming in that supposed to be coming in or going out that week.  
20:27	"And you know, and I'll make I'll change based on that notification."  
20:32	"But then, you know, sometimes I'm like, I'll sit there and think and say I think this is supposed to come out on day X."  
20:38	Let me jump in there and take a look.  
20:40	Is that in there or not?  
20:43	Give me a moment.  
20:44	I'm going to put my phone on do not disturb.  
20:47	"Oh, sure."  
20:55	"OK, sorry about that."  
20:57	"So, you know, that's a couple of times a week that I'll get a notification, you know, whether it's Netflix or my cell phone or like before I jumped on here, \[redacted\]"  
21:21	"And so I had a notification, oh, auto insurance is due today."  
21:26	But we also need to separate that because \[redacted\]  
21:35	And myself and my truck and my Jeep need to be on a separate policy because \[redacted\]  
21:48	"But well, her, \[redacted\]"  
21:53	"So that's where, yeah, I'm in it a couple of times a week."  
21:58	"OK, got it."  
21:59	"And do you, so is, is everything in your, your, your, your Google Calendar are there, do you keep any spreadsheets or anything or is it all within the calendar?"  
22:09	It's all within the Google Calendar for now.  
22:11	"I have previously kept spreadsheets and, and a whiteboard."  
22:20	"So a monthly whiteboard that I used, you know, and I use that in addition to my Gmail, my Google Calendar."  
22:30	"But yeah, I, I had previously used spreadsheets."  
22:34	"I stopped using them temporarily because it's just, you know, they're the issue of what is and what is not joint versus personal bills."  
22:46	"That's like, I'm not, I'm just going to, I'm going to bring everything into this account and then I will transfer what I need to over here."  
22:56	"So it's kind of hard right now to budget things just because of, \[redacted\]."  
23:11	\[redacted\]  
23:19	"And so once the house sells and then bills get paid, then I can go back into doing it."  
23:27	"Much more active budgeting stance to use, you know, going back and using my spreadsheet, still using the Google Calendar and using my whiteboard as a daily reminder like, oh, hey, you got XY and Z coming up."  
23:46	"So, you know, don't buy too much on Amazon this week."  
23:55	And any anything else that might be challenging or confusing in terms of keeping track of everything that that needs to be paid throughout the months?  
24:08	"No, I don't I don't think so."  
24:10	"OK, got it."  
24:12	"All right, so we're going to look at a couple prototypes."  
24:15	So let me have you share your screen 1st and then we'll get logged into Figma and then I'll send you the actual prototype link.  
24:27	"Share screen, start broadcast."  
24:32	"OK, All right."  
24:35	"OK, there we go."  
24:36	It is coming.  
24:37	Perfect.  
24:38	OK.  
24:38	And let me have you open the Figma app that you had downloaded.  
24:42	I've got a test account for you to log in there.  
24:49	"All right, if you want to swipe my video off to the side."  
24:53	"Yeah, perfect."  
24:54	"All right, So tap login to Figma."  
24:58	Yep.  
24:58	Continue.  
25:01	"OK, Under e-mail, it's going to be VA Test 000 at gmail.com."  
25:17	And then the password.  
25:18	"It's a long one, but it is a pattern on the keyboard, so hopefully it'll be easier."  
25:23	Capital a lowercase from here on out.  
25:28	ZSXDC FV2468.  
25:38	"All right, go ahead and log in."  
25:43	Sometimes it asks for a No need to save that password.  
25:46	"Yeah, sometimes it asks for a code."  
25:48	Let's see if it does.  
25:48	"Nope, it hasn't asked for a code this time around."  
25:50	"OK, all right, now I Oh, you can not now, because I don't think you'll be needing to use that."  
25:58	"OK, All right, I'm going to send you a link from Zoom, So if you want to switch back to Zoom or maybe the."  
26:07	"No, actually it probably won't pop up since you've turned on Do not disturb."  
26:13	I think I have to go in after the zoom.  
26:15	"Oh, yeah."  
26:16	Go back or actually go to the.  
26:17	"No, no, I think that one that you were just on."  
26:20	Yeah.  
26:20	Tap once in the middle and see if the option.  
26:23	"OK, there we go."  
26:24	There's the chat on the lower left.  
26:26	That's what we need.  
26:26	Yep.  
26:27	Tap once into the the very long URL.  
26:31	"OK, perfect."  
26:32	Natural.  
26:32	Open that up.  
26:35	Give it a moment.  
26:35	Sometimes figma is a bit slow.  
26:38	"OK, perfect."  
26:39	That wasn't too bad at all.  
26:41	"OK, so in this example we are going to pretend that you do have some benefit overpayments from disability and education benefits."  
26:50	And also we're pretending that you have some medical co-pays from regular doctor visits and prescriptions.  
26:57	"So first before I have you tap into anything, I'm curious to if you have thoughts about when you might want to look at just the co-pay bills or just the overpayments or if you'd want to look at them all together like the combined statements."  
27:19	I would actually like to see him view them separately like co-pay bills and overpayments.  
27:30	"OK, Yeah, I know that I see here combined statement, but I think having them separate is better because you know exactly what is what."  
27:41	OK from this screen got it.  
27:43	"OK, great."  
27:45	"And then what would be before I have you tap into anything, what would be your assumption of what you would find under a combined statement here?"  
27:55	So not knowing what what anything is.  
27:57	"So being a combined statement may be, you know, pretty much what's on this page saying, hey, you've got a co-pay for this amount and then we've also overpaid you for this amount and saying you got to pay these by X date."  
28:20	"OK, got it."  
28:21	And so and so you yeah.  
28:22	"And again, so you're saying that you would most likely just want to look at just the co-pay bills or just the overpayments separately."  
28:29	"Yes, OK, yeah and just to to keep things is is that more for simplicity or any other reason you might want to look at just them individually For me it's it would be simplicity of not having to you know try to figure out, you know, not knowing what's in combined statement trying to not figure out OK, what what is these bills for?"  
28:51	"I know that OK, the co-pay bills."  
28:53	I know that those are typically do you know they would do within 30 days to not have late fees added.  
29:02	Late fees are interest added.  
29:04	And so I've never received an overpayment.  
29:06	"So I don't know what like the repayment plan would be for overpayments, but I would definitely like to see them separately."  
29:15	"OK, got it."  
29:16	"So we'll get to that in a moment, But let me first have you tap into where it says combined statement."  
29:20	"Yes, so this so this is roughly what you might find on the the website now if you had both."  
29:34	"But yeah, Scroll down and again pretending that you are in a situation where you have both co-pays and then a few overpayment of benefit overpayments."  
29:43	"Leah, let me know your thoughts as you're looking through this, about the information that is presented to you, what you think might be important, when you might use this."  
30:23	OK.  
30:23	"So you know the, the co-pay charges are pretty similar to what you know, what I received in paper form."  
30:35	"And when I look at it online, you know that that's pretty standard stuff right there."  
30:44	The overpayment charges.  
30:50	It looks like this test account is paying $100 a month somehow to pay this debt.  
31:02	"Looking at this, I'd like to know what the heck this balance increase in the amount of $15 per month is like."  
31:10	Why is that done?  
31:13	And then like this just says balance decrease $100.00.  
31:20	So that's whatever payment plan.  
31:26	"I would just look looking at this, I'd like to know it's like if that was like a, from like an auto draft, like an ACH transfer auto draft, or if that was being taken out of my, my monthly disability payments post 911."  
31:54	"And then the same thing here, same thing as like where's that for me?"  
31:58	Where's that $200 a month getting paid from?  
32:01	And then why is there a $15.00 a month balance increase?  
32:05	Is that interest?  
32:06	Is that or what?  
32:11	"Yes, 'cause it's like if I received a bill from anybody and it just says balance increase, I'm like, what the heck is that from?"  
32:20	"You know, it's not like a an itemized."  
32:23	"I would definitely want something itemized like a bank statement or a credit card bill to see what this charge is, why it was, you know, why it was added."  
32:37	"So, yeah, and the same thing with the Chapter 35."  
32:42	"OK, some more detail on all of them."  
32:43	Got it.  
32:44	And then what are your thoughts on this?  
32:47	"Could be on a scale of one to five, how overwhelming, if at all, does this feel to you?"  
32:57	"For me, 5 being very overwhelming, one being not."  
33:02	I would say two only because there's not enough detail for me to understand what these what these charges and debits are.  
33:16	"OK, got it."  
33:18	OK.  
33:18	"And then for the information that is presented here, how might you want to interact with this?"  
33:26	"And when I say how I'm thinking more, would you want to look at it on your phone?"  
33:31	Would you want to look at it on your desktop?  
33:33	Would you print things out?  
33:34	"Would you want things coming to you in e-mail, something along those lines?"  
33:41	"Postal Service mail, snail mail and e-mail would be nice to receive, you know, bills, you know, for me, you know, I'm not some, you know, super crunchy granola person, you know, But if I can reduce paper waste, you know, I will."  
34:06	"And then in addition to reducing paper waste, you know, then there's less cost to the government for postage on these bills, right?"  
34:18	"So a couple of cents here times however many millions of veterans, you know, that eventually adds up."  
34:24	I also understand that there are a number of veterans who are averse to technology.  
34:30	So for them paper statements would be bet would be best utilized.  
34:37	"But for me, I would like the option of being electronically notified of these bills and opt out of paper billing."  
34:46	Got it.  
34:46	"OK, Yeah."  
34:48	And maybe scroll to the top of this page here actually before I ask you that.  
34:53	"So I know that you said that you would want more detail on like the balance increase, balance decrease, et cetera, other are there other things about this page that would make it more useful to how you might use it?"  
35:09	Other things that would make it more useful?  
35:12	"I do like that it's got, you know, the, the, the buttons for review and resolve bills."  
35:20	Got a phone number to discuss.  
35:26	"So I do like that and you know, it's the the for the medical co-pays."  
35:31	"It's broken down by, you know, the facility of where it was where and why it was incurred."  
35:39	So I do like that.  
35:41	"And as far as the, the overpayment, I also like that it's broken down by what exactly was overpaid, you know, the overpayment of the, the CMP and then post 911 and then chapter 35."  
36:01	So I do like that.  
36:02	"OK, got it."  
36:05	All right.  
36:05	And what is your assumption of what you'll find in the download combined statement?  
36:13	"Blue button toward the bottom, the download combined statement."  
36:19	My initial thought is that it's going to be a condensed version of everything that's seeing on this screen in APDF format.  
36:31	"OK, got it."  
36:32	Let me have you tap on that.  
36:39	"And yeah, thoughts on how this compares to what you were expecting?"  
36:43	This is exactly what I was expecting.  
36:45	"OK, this looks just like any, it's very similar to any other bill that I received from the VA."  
36:53	OK.  
36:54	"Just, you know, the only difference is again, you know what I I stated earlier it says balance increase, balance decrease."  
37:01	Like what?  
37:03	Like why?  
37:04	What is that?  
37:04	"Yeah, OK, yeah."  
37:06	"And are you currently using PDFs just in your in, in any sort of financial situations?"  
37:15	Yes.  
37:15	"So like all of my, you know, all of my online statements, or I should say online statements, all my electronic statements come come maybe via PDF."  
37:28	"OK, got it."  
37:31	And are you are you looking at PDFs on your phone at all or is there anything on your desktop?  
37:36	"No, I look at them on my phone as well on the phone."  
37:38	"OK, got it."  
37:40	"And so thoughts on would you, would, would you use this here, this, this, this PDF, especially compared to what we were just looking at the the longer list of all the transactions."  
37:54	"When you say would I use it, What do you I guess like in your, I know we have to pretend, but like if if you did, let's say have both benefit overpayments and some co-pays and you were looking to to manage finances, might this be helpful in, in terms of managing finances?"  
38:11	"Yes, yeah, 'cause it it's got the just like the previous page, this hasn't broken down by, you know, the facility, the co-pay for the facility with the with the dates and then the overpayment by by type the CNP post 911 and chapter 35."  
38:33	OK.  
38:34	Any thoughts of when you might prefer this PDF versus the version that we just looked at with with the longer list?  
38:44	So I would like the PDF as like a like a monthly statement.  
38:49	"I, you know, to be and have the option to look for, you know, have it broken down by almost like a, like a, like a bank statement, an online bank statement where you can look at, you know, go in and search, you know, a date frame, you know, whether it's six months or, you know, two months ago or the last three years."  
39:15	I'd like that.  
39:18	"And you know, this right here looks almost like an annual statement to me, but I would also like it in a monthly statement."  
39:27	"You know, it's like, OK, well this month this is what I owe."  
39:30	"And then, you know, it may say it'll just may have OK."  
39:34	Payment received on what is it November 17th right now.  
39:39	So payment received October 17th for these amounts going towards these debts.  
39:45	"These are your new, this is the payment that's due on December 17th, you know, and these are your credits and debits."  
39:58	"So I'd like a, a monthly and then this almost looks like a like an annual statement or a bi annual statement."  
40:06	"OK, got it."  
40:06	"So the, the information here is actually the same as the information we are just looking at."  
40:13	So I I I'm curious if does one format do would you feel works better for how you like to to look at financial records?  
40:24	I like this style in PDF if it had more information.  
40:28	"Oh, more information, got it."  
40:29	"And can you see more about that, about why you prefer this PDF format versus the other one?"  
40:35	"Because you know, even the the other format I, I would like more information like the why like this."  
40:45	"It's just, I think this is much easier to to view for me, my opinion, I think it's much easier to view."  
40:55	"And, you know, if you're bringing it up on screen, I can, you know, increase or decrease magnification."  
41:05	"I could copy out, you know, the these lines, drop them into a spreadsheet or drop them into, you know, whatever I wanted to to look at and, you know, do whatever math that I wanted to do or, you know, have it as you know, running tally on my part."  
41:30	Mm Hmm.  
41:31	"OK, let me have you tap done there and I'm going to give you bring you to a different session."  
41:37	Tap the home at the very bottom of the screen.  
41:40	So now we're going to look at a different version of a combined statement that is not yet built.  
41:46	So this is brand new things that we're trying out.  
41:49	So tap the future version B on the right hand side.  
41:54	"And so this again, we're pretending that in your situation, you have both co-pays for medical appointments and you also have benefit overpayments."  
42:03	Thoughts on how the information here is laid out and how it might be useful?  
42:15	"So, so far, what the heck do I just do?"  
42:18	"No, sometimes it likes to just reset there."  
42:21	"OK, so tap."  
42:22	"Yeah, OK, you got it."  
42:23	So tap on combined statement again.  
42:25	"Yeah, it likes to do this sometimes."  
42:27	"There you go, it's set."  
42:30	This is combined statement.  
42:32	AI thought we were looking at B.  
42:35	"We were, but we'll just you can look at A first."  
42:37	That's fine.  
42:38	"OK, so on A I'll say that I do not like that you have to go in and drill down into each clinic location because if someone were to miss that or not click on it, then they don't know what what's going on."  
43:14	So I like that.  
43:15	"I like that it's all there initially, like on the previous previous menu."  
43:25	"Oh, you mean like that that section already expanded?"  
43:27	Is that what you?  
43:28	"Yes, this section's already expanded."  
43:29	Yeah.  
43:30	"Oh, OK, OK, got it."  
43:34	"And then how about thoughts of if you like, if you want to make sure you're looking at both your co-pays and your your overpayments, what would that be?"  
43:42	What would that experience be like for you?  
43:48	"So I mean, this is OK having the two separate menu for co-pay and overpayment, but I would still like it already in breakout and not having to to drill down to view what's what just because again, you know, don't want to necessarily miss anything."  
44:17	"And yeah, I think this is, this is OK, this is fine having the two separate menus, one for copay and then another one for overpayments."  
44:32	That way it's also not a information overload on a single screen.  
44:37	Mm hmm.  
44:42	"So since I'll go with that theme of information overload, was there any part of actually scroll to the top of this one and let me have you tap on the the combined PDF statement."  
44:56	"Is there is there any part of this that is information overload to use your to use your words on this one is very similar to like what I said before, this looks more like an, like an annual type statement."  
45:13	"And but yes, it is unless I'm actually actively looking for something that's going back, you know, a year, I'd much rather have just a monthly, monthly debt letter."  
45:27	"What is my debt and when does it need to be paid by rather than, you know, this looks like it goes from November 125 to October 124 on the, on some of this stuff."  
45:45	"So that to me, like I said, it looks more like a oh, shoot, what the heck did I just do?"  
45:51	"Yeah, that that's our, that's our pretend zoom."  
45:53	"It's, it's the only way we could actually make it zoom on the Yeah."  
45:58	So that's what I that's what I think.  
46:01	I think that this is too much unless somebody's actively looking for it.  
46:06	"So I would like just a monthly statement, not just monthly."  
46:15	"It says, OK, X was paid last month, Y is due this month."  
46:20	"OK, got it, got it."  
46:21	Let me have you tap done at the top there.  
46:25	I'll get you back.  
46:27	And then it's.  
46:29	Would there be other information here that might make this more useful?  
46:47	Maybe a button for address change.  
46:52	"Oh, JD address."  
46:52	"OK, got it."  
46:53	"You know, just because I mean, you know, information is, is is there, but then it's like, OK, where can I go to change my address?"  
47:07	"If if that's incorrect, if you didn't look at it before, you're like, oh crap, I need updated here."  
47:13	"You know, maybe have that button to to take you to change of address link."  
47:21	"OK, got it."  
47:22	And let me have you scroll to the bottom.  
47:24	We're going to get to combined statement B just to compare the two.  
47:29	"All right, there we go."  
47:31	Yeah.  
47:32	And thoughts on what you're seeing that is different on this one versus the version a that you were just on?  
47:42	"So I don't know if that was me or what, or if these already come pre expanded, but I do like that they are expanded by the by the clinic location."  
47:56	"And I like that, you know, it's one thing, you know, it's like having it already expanded and then going to to minimize it versus having to having to expand it and to to understand what's going on."  
48:23	So I like the fact that that they were already expanded.  
48:28	"OK, got it."  
48:29	So one one of the really the primary difference that I'll share between version A\&B.  
48:35	So we're on version B here where the actually scroll to the top just a little bit.  
48:39	"OK yeah, right there."  
48:41	"So where it says co-pay bills, it just shows the the total due and how to review and resolve and then scroll back down and get back to version A Yeah."  
48:54	So then Scroll down a bit.  
48:55	Yeah.  
48:55	"So the difference being under co-pay bills, it states the reason you're receiving the billing statement, which that was not previously expanded in the other version."  
49:06	Thoughts on that?  
49:07	Is that useful?  
49:08	Is that extraneous?  
49:09	What's your thought on that information?  
49:13	"I think that's fine and it would help people, you know, especially if they're not greater than 50% to understand why they're receiving the bill."  
49:23	"OK, got it."  
49:25	"And then thoughts on if you were to choose one version over the other, this this phrase being version A, the other one where that information is collapsed, what do you think would be you would you would choose?"  
49:40	I'd like it expanded.  
49:42	"OK, so you like version A?"  
49:44	Yes.  
49:45	And let me have you tap on payments on the lower right.  
49:52	"So we're going to look at this, the individual co-pay bills quickly here."  
49:56	Tap into that.  
49:57	Yeah.  
49:58	So this is just the co-pay bills here.  
50:01	This is all the same information.  
50:02	We're still pretending you're in the same situation of you've got the the two different locations.  
50:10	"Tap into the details of just that that top one, the outpatient clinic."  
50:15	Yeah.  
50:16	Have a look at this information and let me know what you think.  
50:21	"Yeah, it might be useful here, especially compared with the previous the with the combined statement with the two tabs."  
50:36	"And a lot, a lot of the buttons here don't work."  
50:38	So there's more.  
50:38	"Yeah, just looking at them overall."  
50:56	"Yeah, I think this is OK."  
50:57	I think this is all right.  
51:02	Thoughts on having an entire page dedicated to just the co-pays versus the other version where it was the two different tabs to go between the co-pays and the benefit overpayments?  
51:31	I like this version.  
51:32	This is B correct.  
51:34	"Oh, of have of having everything separated."  
51:37	"Yeah, having having everything separated instead of, you know, trying to tab, you know, tab over."  
51:44	"Oh, got it."  
51:44	OK.  
51:44	Can you say more about that?  
51:45	"Why you prefer this is, you know, having separate tabs can sometimes lead to, you know, somebody missing something."  
51:56	"But going to the payments thing says, OK, well, here's these are your bills."  
52:01	"You know, having a separate ones for, you know, having a separate link, you know, in big bold."  
52:08	"You know, I like that more because it does catch your eye rather than in version A where it's just this little, you know, this little ovalic button saying co-pay and then another Oval for overpayments."  
52:25	I like these.  
52:25	"I like these huge, these huge headers."  
52:29	Yeah.  
52:29	"OK, so make it easier to see here."  
52:31	"OK, great."  
52:32	And then any thoughts on if there's one version over the other that you would trust the information you're seeing more?  
52:40	"So either being separated or together with the two tabs, if one seems like more trustworthy to you, I don't think that one seems more trustworthy to me."  
52:53	I I like the layout of B better.  
52:56	"I mean, there's parts of a that I like, but overall I would say that that I like B more."  
53:03	So B mean this one here with the co-pay.  
53:06	"OK, separate."  
53:06	"OK, OK."  
53:09	"And then let's say if we were to wave Magic wand where I know you said you like this version overall with the co-pay separate overpay, separate anything that you might like that you appreciated better in the combined statement that you would want to bring over into the individual copays or overpay if you want to tap into a combined statement in the middle of the screen there if there's if there's anything here that you that you like better."  
53:49	"I don't know that, but I would say I like it better if this is still going to be, you know, potentially option B."  
54:13	"You know, this is you got co-pay bills, overpayments, combined statement."  
54:19	"You know, I just I would say like better."  
54:24	Probably not.  
54:25	"The only thing that I would say is like, you know, clicking on this."  
54:30	"Oh, oh, oh, it it just seems redundant because you've got you've already got a tab for co-pay, bills, overpayments."  
54:43	"Then you go to combined statement, right."  
54:46	I think that this should literally just be combined statement.  
54:49	"And now it's still got, you know, the co-pay and overpayments tab, which is still it's the exact same thing here."  
54:58	"OK, got it."  
54:59	"Yeah, I just think that that's redundant."  
55:01	Got it.  
55:01	OK.  
55:02	"And would you, so if you had this version we're looking at here, would there be a time that you would want that combined that that PDF statement all in one?"  
55:11	Would that ever be useful to you?  
55:13	"Yes, absolutely."  
55:15	"You know, it's like whether like it here in combined statement, like I would like to see, you know, it's like, you know, a breakout of everything that would like in I guess it was in AI think I said that I was like, oh, I liked it."  
55:30	"It's got everything listed out, you know, and broken down by the the clinic and then it was the CNP overpayments post 911 and chapter 35 overpayments."  
55:47	"I would have expected to see all of that in here on just one page rather than having the separation of co-pays and overpayments, you know, and then, you know, just and also having a you know, view PDF of it, you know, and having potentially having the ability to look at the entire year, you know, current month, previous month, you know, or a date or a custom date range."  
56:20	Got it.  
56:21	"OK, All right."  
56:22	So it's not just a mix and I know we're overtime and I apologize it sounds like.  
56:25	So you would like seeing the overpay and the co-pay separately the version with the with the the the large bonds to get to those and then also have the option to see that PDF with everything together?  
56:40	"Yes, yes, got it."  
56:42	"OK, great."  
56:44	"Yeah, that is those I believe are all the questions anything else that you would like to share regarding managing finances?"  
56:56	"Yeah, that you haven't."  
56:57	"Oh, I'm sorry I didn't wrap one final question, apologies."  
57:00	Would their thoughts on would you use this on the app Your the the ability to to view all the statements or to view the the transaction statements and and make payments on the app?  
57:15	"Yes, I would."  
57:16	"OK, All right."  
57:18	Got it.  
57:19	Yeah.  
57:20	So back to my other question.  
57:21	Any other thoughts regarding finances and managing things that you haven't already shared that I haven't already shared?  
57:34	"No, I don't I don't think so."  
57:40	Let's see here.  
57:42	Let me look at this real quick review and resolve co-pay bills.  
57:46	Maybe just have a link to to pay.gov.  
57:49	"OK, Yeah, you know, on, you know, everywhere."  
57:57	"Like even though that this is you know, it's like co-pay bills from here, right?"  
58:03	"We've got, you know, have a, you know, however, wherever Resolve co-pay goes to then, you know, have the link to pay.gov and this and then the same thing with, you know, overpayments."  
58:19	Here's like clicking any button for Resolve overpayment.  
58:23	"I don't know what that would look like, but you know, having a link to pay.gov."  
58:29	"Yeah, OK."  
58:31	Makes sense.
