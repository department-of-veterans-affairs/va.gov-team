## **Transcript: P06**

0:01	"OK, so now that we are recording, are you OK if I record the audio and visual as we talk today?"	  
0:09	I'm OK with that.	  
0:10	"Great, great."	  
0:10	And our would you be OK if I potentially share any clips from this session with our VA partners?	  
0:17	I'm OK with that.	  
0:18	"Great, thank you."	  
0:19	"OK, so now dive in and 1st, I'd love to know at whatever level you're comfortable with a little bit about yourself as a veteran could be what branch you served or when you retired or separated \[redacted\] of 2023."	  
0:35	"OK, great."	  
0:37	And what sort of interactions and or experiences with Veteran Affairs have you had since then?	  
0:48	I guess I don't know fairly light.	  
0:50	"I mean, I, I haven't thankfully had to have that many medical issues that require me to use like the VA that much."	  
0:59	I I do have.	  
1:03	"I did receive an overpayment, however, some some time ago, probably ago earlier this year."	  
1:13	"But other than that, like my overall interactions with the VA have actually been rather minimal."	  
1:20	"OK, I got it."	  
1:20	"Do you, have you gone into any of their, their physical locations rather than meeting other people or?"	  
1:26	"Yeah, any, any."	  
1:27	And I know there's a variety of of physical location and buildings throughout.	  
1:31	Yeah.	  
1:31	For like medical care and such.	  
1:32	Yeah.	  
1:33	"OK, great."	  
1:34	And then what has been your experience with using the VA website or and or the VA mobile app?	  
1:44	Both are fairly easy to navigate.	  
1:47	I don't have the app downloaded though.	  
1:48	I mostly usually just do things on my computer.	  
1:50	Got it.	  
1:50	OK.	  
1:51	And what have you have you ever had the app downloaded?	  
1:55	I have had it before.	  
1:56	I just never like I just never used it.	  
1:58	And then overtime like Apple like deletes apps that you don't use.	  
2:03	"So OK, got it."	  
2:05	"When you did have a downloader, do you recall when you might have like when, when you had opened it probably sometime after being discharged, maybe like 2024, early 2024."	  
2:19	"And do you recall what, what you would use the app for as opposed to things you might have done on the website?"	  
2:27	Nothing different.	  
2:28	Nothing different.	  
2:29	"OK, got it."	  
2:31	"And what sorts of things do you do on the website on the duck of check my, check my benefits?"	  
2:41	"OK, got it."	  
2:42	All right.	  
2:45	So now we're going to move into the financial portion of the discussion.	  
2:49	And I want to make sure you're only sharing anything that you are comfortable with.	  
2:52	"Like I said, I don't have any access into any of your records."	  
2:56	So I know you briefly mentioned that you have had overpayments at whatever level you're comfortable.	  
3:01	Would love to know what your experience with that has been.	  
3:10	My experience with what sorry with with benefit overpayments.	  
3:19	"So I've, I had an overpayment earlier this year because I had not updated my, what was it?"	  
3:28	"My, like my, my income from, from 2024."	  
3:36	"And so I was, I had to repay it in 2025."	  
3:40	"OK, got it."	  
3:40	And do you recall how you first learned of this overpayment?	  
3:45	There was a letter sent in the mail as well as a notification.	  
3:49	I believe there's a notification on my login.	  
3:51	"OK, got it."	  
3:53	And was that a surprise or did you know that that was coming?	  
4:01	"I don't know if it was necessarily a surprise, but I know that it was possible."	  
4:05	"OK, got it."	  
4:07	"And was it when you received notification was, was it clear what, what it, what it was for?"	  
4:13	Did you understand everything about it?	  
4:15	"Yes, it was because I, I my income that I initially reported it was not what I actually received 2024."	  
4:23	And so there was like a \[redacted\] that was anything considered overpaid.	  
4:28	"OK, I got it."	  
4:29	"And when when you received the letter, was it clear what your options were in regards to repaying it?"	  
4:37	"Yeah, well, I could do like an offering compromise."	  
4:40	"I could try to negotiate it down or I could just pay it overtime, pay it upfront."	  
4:45	"OK, got it."	  
4:46	"And since then, has there been any other communication that you've received regarding the overpayment?"	  
4:53	"Well, no, because I, I effectively just paid it upfront."	  
4:57	"Oh, you did OK, got it."	  
4:58	All right.	  
4:59	"And then I know you briefly mentioned a little bit of healthcare, but how about any experience with co-pays that you've had?"	  
5:09	"I mean, I've had to pay for co-pays before."	  
5:11	Sometimes I was not charged at the point of service and so the co-pays would just be added to my account to pay.	  
5:18	"Oh, got it, got it."	  
5:19	"And so in instances like that or really any of them similar question as with the overpayments, how did you learn about any co-pay bills that you had to pay?"	  
5:29	They went same way bill and then notification.	  
5:31	Got it.	  
5:31	OK.	  
5:32	"And again, were those a surprise or did you know that those were coming?"	  
5:35	"No, those are no, those are expected to come."	  
5:39	OK.	  
5:39	And was it always clear to you what they were for when you received the bills?	  
5:43	"Yeah, they described the service exactly that was rendered."	  
5:46	And what the copay was was great.	  
5:49	And then was it clear what sort of options you had in terms of repaying them?	  
5:55	"Well, I don't remember if I got off on compromise."	  
5:59	I just paid it upfront.	  
6:01	You did OK.	  
6:02	"All right, so now I'd love to talk about times that you're actively managing finances."	  
6:10	"And when I say manage that, I'm meaning anytime if you're maybe on the phone with someone or reading the letters or just looking at the finances together, when you are doing any sort of financial management, talk to me about when you're typically doing that."	  
6:27	"And that could be like a certain time of the month or like if you're in a physical location, something like that."	  
6:51	I'm not able to hear anything.	  
6:52	"I'm not sure if there's something on your end with the oh, I'm sorry, can you say the question?"	  
6:58	"Yeah, of course, for sure."	  
6:59	Yeah.	  
6:59	"So I'm, I'm, I'm curious about like when you do any sort of financial management and, and if there's like a certain time of with within the month or week or if you're in a physical location whenever you're needing to maybe review any bills or debts or make payments or look into any of the details of them."	  
7:23	All the way around the end of the month is when I make sure like I just verify that all bills have been paid.	  
7:29	Most of my bills are actually due at the beginning of the following month.	  
7:33	"OK, so I just try to have it paid by like the first few days of the end of the prior month."	  
7:39	"OK, got it."	  
7:40	"And do you have like what what is your process for making sure that everything is paid as you say, within the first few days of the month?"	  
7:49	"Well, auto pay usually helps a lot, but other than that, I do keep a a spreadsheet as well."	  
7:56	"Oh, you do."	  
7:57	OK.	  
7:59	"And what, what, what sort of information are you keeping within that spreadsheet?"	  
8:03	Who's the company that I need to pay?	  
8:05	How much is the bill?	  
8:09	And I also keep a tab on like what like how much money is in my checking account to get those bills.	  
8:17	OK.	  
8:18	And is it are are you only looking at everything like toward the end of the month or is it at at all throughout the month that you're looking at these things?	  
8:27	"Usually at the end of the month, unless I get some notification via e-mail about like some charge that like maybe I don't recognize and then I have to do some further investigation."	  
8:35	"Oh, good."	  
8:35	"OK, that brings me to my next question of yeah, are there other other any, any prompts that 'cause this?"	  
8:41	"So I so like you said, you have any sort of notification about other other charges."	  
8:48	"Is, is there anything else that that prompts you to take action on any management?"	  
8:54	"No, that that would be all."	  
8:55	Got it.	  
8:56	"OK, great."	  
8:57	"So thinking about both the overpayments and the co-pays together, I'd like to know if you're like how you think about them?"	  
9:07	Are you thinking about them as one type of money to be repaid?	  
9:12	Are you thinking about them separately however you like?	  
9:15	What's your thoughts about them?	  
9:19	"Sorry, what do you mean by what type of money to be repaid?"	  
9:22	"Like I guess if you thinking about from a from a a broader perspective of like any, any kind of money you owe really anybody."	  
9:32	I know you said you have a bunch of bills that are due toward the beginning of the month.	  
9:36	Thinking about both overpayment and copay in in your mind are those that's all one of the same?	  
9:43	That's all I need to think of it as a bill.	  
9:45	Got it.	  
9:45	"OK, if you get the same, all right, got it."	  
9:48	"And it sounds like you're, well, you're making payments at at the same time for everything."	  
9:55	"Yeah, usually around the end of the month."	  
9:56	Got it.	  
9:57	OK.	  
10:00	And is there anything that is challenging or confusing about keeping track of both of those types of money owed?	  
10:09	"No, no."	  
10:09	"OK, got it."	  
10:13	And are you ever looking at at information or the history of both Overpay and Co and co-pays at the same time?	  
10:24	Not really.	  
10:24	No.	  
10:25	No.	  
10:25	OK.	  
10:25	"All right, So we're going to move into looking at some prototypes and I'd like to have you share your screen first."	  
10:35	Have you done the screen share on Zoom in the past?	  
10:42	I have.	  
10:42	Yes.	  
10:42	I can share my screen.	  
10:44	You.	  
10:44	I think you're going to send me some kind of link.	  
10:46	Yeah.	  
10:46	"Yeah, I will."	  
10:47	Yeah.	  
10:47	I just want it's hugely easier to have the screen share first and then we'll open up Figma and then I'll send you the link.	  
11:06	"All right, that oh, it shared and then it went away."	  
11:11	"So, oh, wait a minute."	  
11:11	"No, no, no, it did OK, perfect sharing screen."	  
11:15	"And then let me have you, I'll have you open up the Figma app."	  
11:21	"I'm going to give you a, a test account to log in and then we'll come back to the link that I'm going to send you."	  
11:34	All right.	  
11:34	"So tap login to Figma, OK, And the e-mail is going to be VA test000@gmail.com, OK."	  
11:55	"And the password, it's kind of long, but it is a pattern on the keyboard."	  
12:00	"So it's capital A ZS, Yeah."	  
12:06	"Oh, I'm sorry."	  
12:06	"Just the A is capitalized, everything else to be lower case."	  
12:10	OK.	  
12:10	"Yeah, I see."	  
12:11	OK.	  
12:12	SXDC FV2468.	  
12:25	OK.	  
12:25	And it may ask for a code.	  
12:28	Let me see if it does.	  
12:30	Sometimes it does and sometimes not.	  
12:33	"OK, does not."	  
12:34	"All right, so give me a moment."	  
12:35	I'm going to send you a link.	  
12:39	Put that into Zoom.	  
12:43	"OK, so go ahead and tap once on that, and that should open back up in Figma."	  
12:47	"And if you want to swipe my video image off to the side, that'll give a little more space."	  
12:55	Perfect.	  
12:57	"All right, give it a moment to load up."	  
12:59	Sometimes it's a tad slow.	  
13:02	"All right, great."	  
13:03	So we're going to pretend that you have overpayment debt from both some disability and education benefits.	  
13:13	And we're also going to pretend that you have some Co payments from regular doctor visits and prescriptions.	  
13:21	"So this is sort of representing what is on the app now a little bit, but thoughts on if you're opening up the app and see that you have information for both co-pays and overpayments and also things together."	  
13:39	What are your thoughts on when you might want to look at everything together as opposed to look at each one separately?	  
13:47	I would just usually look at a combined statement.	  
13:49	"I don't really see the needs to look at it and eventually, OK, got it."	  
13:52	"Can you say more about that, about why you would choose that?"	  
13:56	Because it's faster?	  
13:57	"I mean, at the end of the day, I have to pay for all of it anyhow."	  
13:59	"So I'd rather just see everything in one one, like see everything at once."	  
14:03	"OK, got it."	  
14:04	"And before I have you tap into that, what are your expectations about what you're going to find in the line items for co-pays, what the charges are, the line items for overpayments, what the charges are?"	  
14:15	"OK, great."	  
14:16	Let me have you tap into combined statement.	  
14:19	All right.	  
14:19	"So you can scroll around here and share your thoughts about what you're seeing, any thoughts, what might be helpful etcetera."	  
14:31	"So I am seeing a combined statement showing the different copay charges, the services that were rendered, the amount of the charge, pretty straightforward."	  
14:45	"It starts with Co payments 1st and overpayments next, which is intuitive to me because that's what I saw in the earlier screen."	  
15:00	Like it was copays first and then overpayments.	  
15:02	OK.	  
15:03	Yeah.	  
15:07	See overpayment charges here with the description as well and the date.	  
15:22	"And then more overpayments related to something else, other reasons."	  
15:29	This is all fairly very straightforward and easy to understand.	  
15:32	"OK, got it."	  
15:34	"And I so you said you would, you would generally prefer to do this, the combined statement because everything is all together."	  
15:41	"What sort of information, or I guess is there any information on that's not on here that you would find to make this even more useful?"	  
15:54	"Not that I can think of, no."	  
15:55	"OK, And on a scale of one to five, how overwhelming, if at all, does this appear to you?"	  
16:03	Not overwhelming at all.	  
16:05	Very easy to navigate.	  
16:07	"OK, great."	  
16:08	"And then any further thoughts on how this might be or how how the experience might be different as opposed to looking at the individual statements for like it just just co-pays or just it would be it would be a shorter page, Shorter page."	  
16:23	Yeah.	  
16:23	OK.	  
16:24	"And thoughts on how you might prefer to interact with this information, meaning could be on your phone, could be on your desktop."	  
16:32	Do you like to print things out?	  
16:33	Do you like to desktop?	  
16:34	But that's just my normal habit in most cases for anything financial related.	  
16:37	"Oh, anything financial."	  
16:38	OK.	  
16:39	"Can you say more about that, about why you choose desktop for all finances?"	  
16:43	I just like looking at bigger screens for that type of stuff.	  
16:46	"OK, got it."	  
16:48	And do you ever print anything out?	  
16:50	No.	  
16:51	"OK, got it."	  
16:54	Thoughts.	  
16:54	"And before have you tap in, what are your thoughts on or rather your assumption on what the download combined statement button toward the bottom of that screen would?"	  
17:02	It would probably open APDF.	  
17:04	OK.	  
17:05	And do you ever use PDFs really at all or especially on your phone?	  
17:11	"Yes on computer again, on my on my phone, not as much."	  
17:18	It's not like I just like for like text like that like I just like to look at it at a big screen.	  
17:24	"OK, got it."	  
17:26	"And if if you are using PD FS on the phone, what are yeah, how are how are you interacting with them?"	  
17:33	It depends on how this opens.	  
17:34	"I mean, it's sometimes it's different by so like sometimes it'll download it and then I got to open up in the files app or it'll just open a new tab with the PDF showing."	  
17:43	So like either or I've interacted with.	  
17:46	"OK, got it."	  
17:47	Let me have you tap on the download combined statement and then thoughts on how this compares to what you were expecting?	  
17:57	"No, it opens APDF, which is my expectation."	  
17:59	And then you could save it to your files.	  
18:02	Is that something you would ever do?	  
18:03	Save it to your files.	  
18:05	Yes.	  
18:06	"OK, got it on on your phone specifically, or would you or would it be just on the desktop?"	  
18:13	Desktop.	  
18:14	Got it.	  
18:15	OK.	  
18:18	"And so so would you, would you ever want to open this up on your phone?"	  
18:24	"I mean, not really just because it's not as easy for me to read."	  
18:27	I prefer reading on a computer.	  
18:29	And not to say that like I'm unable to do so it's just not as convenient for me.	  
18:33	Sure.	  
18:34	"OK, got it."	  
18:36	And any other thoughts on if this PDF could be any more useful for you?	  
18:47	And I don't have any thoughts.	  
18:49	"OK, you can, yeah, just tap that once."	  
18:53	That's that's how we built the prototype.	  
18:54	There's not really an actual zoom in on the prototype.	  
18:57	"All right, you can go ahead and press done on the top there."	  
19:02	OK.	  
19:02	And then tap on home toward the bottom.	  
19:07	"So going back, I know you said you would generally prefer the combined statement versus the individual copay or overpay."	  
19:13	Let me be tap on the overpayments.	  
19:15	I want to get any further thoughts on the individual statements.	  
19:20	"So yeah, so this it would be the same debt information on this as opposed to on the combined statement."	  
19:28	Thoughts on looking at things here compared with the combined statement?	  
19:35	"I think that this one has a little bit more level of detail because you can actually resolve the overpayment here, which I didn't see that you were able to do in the combined statement."	  
19:44	I would prefer that in the combined statement you can also resolve the overpayment.	  
19:47	"OK, OK."	  
19:50	I can go ahead and look at the I think it just the top one just has the the details.	  
19:56	We built that out.	  
19:58	Yeah.	  
20:08	Yeah.	  
20:08	"So like this looks like it's just more, more, more level of detail than I saw in the combined combined statement."	  
20:18	"I would prefer to have this level of detail in the combined statement, OK."	  
20:24	"Mainly though, it's about resolving the overpayment that I care about and I would want that in the combined statement."	  
20:29	"OK, So if the resolve section or if the resolve option where in the combined statement that would satisfy your needs."	  
20:36	"Yes, got it."	  
20:37	OK.	  
20:40	"And then is there any, so outside of making sure you can resolve, is there any other information that you would want to make sure to have when considering all finances that are related to the VA amount due, services rendered, description of the charge, same thing that I saw in the combined statement."	  
21:03	OK.	  
21:05	"How about any, any levels of trust if they would be different on the combined statement versus the individual, if would there be one that you might trust more?"	  
21:17	"No, it's all the same source of information."	  
21:20	"So OK, got it."	  
21:23	OK.	  
21:24	"And any I know you said that you generally do financial stuff on your desktop, but would there be any instance where you might you want to use your phone for, for financial information like this maybe just like resolve the overpayment itself, but not really to like review information."	  
21:45	OK.	  
21:45	OK.	  
21:48	And any thoughts on when you might choose to resolve on your phone versus like doing any sort of management on your desktop computer?	  
21:57	If I have some due date and for whatever reason I don't have access to my like laptop.	  
22:02	"OK, All right, let me have you tap home on the bottom there."	  
22:14	"Yeah, and I'm going to have you tap future version A."	  
22:18	"So these are designs that are not yet anywhere in the app, but this is an option we're looking at for a combined statement."	  
22:29	"Look around this and yeah, share any thoughts you have and then I'll ask any follow up questions."	  
22:36	"Yeah, so it's just a slightly different layout where instead of scrolling as much, you can like switch between copays and overpayments."	  
22:44	"I think that's cleaner 'cause it's less the scroll, especially on a phone."	  
22:48	And I still like it has like the information on resolving charges and the description of each charge.	  
22:56	OK.	  
22:59	And are there any and any details missing that you feel would be important on this?	  
23:10	"No, no."	  
23:11	OK.	  
23:13	"And how about looking at the a combined PDF statement here, like compared with the the designs we were just looking at where you could switch back and forth from the copays."	  
23:28	I like this because I don't switch back and forth.	  
23:31	"Oh, the the combined statement like this view because I don't have to switch back and forth."	  
23:39	"Oh between between the the copay, no repayment."	  
23:42	Yes.	  
23:43	"OK, got it."	  
23:47	"And and would you would you find the PDF statement useful in that case, then?"	  
23:53	"Yes, but again, I would review it on my desktop."	  
23:55	It's the desktop.	  
23:55	"OK, got it."	  
23:58	"OK, so you said this was cleaner because there's less scrolling."	  
24:03	Would the thoughts on the copay and overpayments being on different different tabs?	  
24:13	I like that better because it's less scrolling.	  
24:15	Yeah.	  
24:15	"OK, good."	  
24:21	And how about how likely might you be to to use this in the app?	  
24:28	Let's pretend that you you you had the app downloaded pretty pretty often if I was actually using it on my phone.	  
24:40	Mm.	  
24:40	Hmm.	  
24:40	What?	  
24:41	I know you said you you may use you may use your phone to make any payments.	  
24:45	Any other instances where you might.	  
24:47	"No, no."	  
24:48	Just the big payments.	  
24:50	Yeah.	  
24:50	OK.	  
24:51	And what might prompt you to make the payments on the phone?	  
24:54	"If there's a pending due date, It's OK."	  
24:55	All right.	  
24:59	"And how might you want to to know that there is a due date being notified via mail, e-mail, OK on e-mail any other way?"	  
25:09	That's primarily it.	  
25:11	OK.	  
25:13	All right.	  
25:17	"OK, sorry, I'm looking at some of my notes here and let me get I'm just gonna have you go back and and look at the individual statements again just to make sure that our other just have you compare again."	  
25:33	"Tap on the the payments on the lower right, the tab with the lower right."	  
25:40	Yeah.	  
25:40	And then go ahead and tap on co-pay bills there.	  
25:45	Yeah.	  
25:46	"So it can let you resolve each of these co-pays and shows you the amount due and the location and the due date, which is important."	  
25:53	So this is all useful.	  
25:55	OK.	  
25:58	And then again any any further thoughts on this view here as opposed to the one we were just looking at with the two different tabs of overpay and co-pay?	  
26:09	I think the other one is better just because it allows you to access both at the same time.	  
26:13	"OK, same time."	  
26:13	"OK, let me have you tap on payments again, the lower right and then go back to combined statement."	  
26:23	"Yeah, there we go."	  
26:26	And how about the way that the details of the co-pays and overpayments here are laid out.	  
26:34	I think I'm fine with that because you can.	  
26:39	These are just payments.	  
26:40	"Oh, OK."	  
26:41	The details are here.	  
26:42	Yeah.	  
26:42	So this is what I was looking for.	  
26:43	This is all easily available and accessible.	  
26:45	So this is straightforward.	  
26:47	OK.	  
26:48	And then let me have you look at the the overpay section also just to get your thoughts there as well.	  
27:00	"Yeah, same thing."	  
27:01	"It's just breaking down description of the charge, how far back, especially with the overpay, might you want to see a transaction."	  
27:15	"So let this catch up a little bit, maybe 90 days, 90 days."	  
27:20	"OK, Yeah."	  
27:20	"Let me have you go back to combined, looks like it restarted a bit."	  
27:23	Have you go back into combined statement?	  
27:29	"All right, and then back to overpay overpayments."	  
27:36	"OK, All right."	  
27:37	So you said about about 90 days.	  
27:39	"Well, maybe scroll up because one of them is longer and I want to get your thoughts on that one."	  
27:45	"Well, where oh we we lost the the screen share."	  
28:01	So where did you want me to?	  
28:03	"Oh, well, Oh, yeah."	  
28:04	"OK, now screen shares back."	  
28:05	"Oh, yeah."	  
28:05	There was some little weird glitch there.	  
28:09	So go back to.	  
28:10	Yeah.	  
28:11	So the the post 911 GI Bill open up that one.	  
28:16	"And I'm just responding to your mention of just wanting to see 90 days, this one being longer."	  
28:22	I'm curious to get your thoughts on.	  
28:26	"Oh, sorry, scroll up again."	  
28:27	"I think something got a little switched here, yeah, because this is about bit beyond 98 since going up to August."	  
28:38	"OK, scroll back toward the top."	  
28:40	I think something something in the prototype got a little wonky here.	  
28:44	So there there is there is one that had about a year of transactions.	  
28:50	Thoughts on that?	  
28:53	I don't think that's necessary.	  
28:54	"I think 90 days is OK, just 90 days."	  
28:55	"OK, got it."	  
28:56	"How about if you wanted to see further information beyond 90 days, where would you expect to go?"	  
29:02	Maybe some bun that just says see more history.	  
29:05	"OK, so just expanding more there."	  
29:09	"Like maybe like once I get to this point, like this August portion, then there's a bun that says like, see more transactions."	  
29:14	"Oh, got it."	  
29:15	"OK, makes sense."	  
29:19	OK.	  
29:20	And then scroll to the bottom.	  
29:22	We're going to have you look at a different version.	  
29:27	Sorry.	  
29:27	Scroll where?	  
29:28	"Scroll, scroll to the bottom of this one of this page."	  
29:30	OK Yeah.	  
29:39	"And then go to combined statement B and yeah, curious about any differences you notice between the version A and version B?"	  
29:51	Not really.	  
29:54	"OK, let me have you go back to AI, can't tell the difference."	  
30:03	OK.	  
30:04	So I'll just share what is.	  
30:06	"So the difference is the under where it says copay bills toward the bottom it says you're receiving this billing statement, etcetera, etcetera."	  
30:14	That information is not open and readily available in the other version.	  
30:21	I see.	  
30:22	Got it.	  
30:24	Thoughts on that?	  
30:26	Is that useful?	  
30:27	Is that?	  
30:28	Yeah.	  
30:28	Does that affect anything about how you might use this?	  
30:31	No.	  
30:32	Has no difference other than it's included or not.	  
30:34	"OK, OK."	  
30:41	"And how about any thoughts if you go back, tap payment on the lower right there again."	  
30:50	"OK, so we'll pretend this is one of the whole the whole payment section within the app."	  
30:59	Thoughts on where you would expect to find the combined statement within the app?	  
31:04	"Well, it's right here, right?"	  
31:08	"I mean, is that I I well, sorry, I didn't explain that."	  
31:10	"Was that, is that a logical place?"	  
31:12	Would you expect it to find it anywhere else?	  
31:14	"No, that's a logical place."	  
31:15	Yeah.	  
31:16	"OK, got it."	  
31:21	"And sorry, reviewing my notes, making sure I didn't forget things."	  
31:30	"Can we check in with my team, Natalie, Natasha, if there are questions that you have, you can unmute and ask them."	  
31:39	"Just reviewing to see if I've forgotten anything, but feel free to speak up and ask things."	  
31:49	Sorry.	  
31:50	"Between the two versions, I'm sorry of the combined statement."	  
31:56	"I know you said that there was there wasn't really a difference, but if you had to choose between version A or version B, which one do you prefer?"	  
32:10	"I, I mean, I, I didn't even know there was a difference between the combined, like the actual P opening of the PDF."	  
32:16	"No, the if if you want to tap into a combined statement toward the, the middle of this page."	  
32:21	Yeah.	  
32:21	So this is the the difference being the the explanation under a copay bill is that was probably the one without it because it's I don't think it's not that necessary.	  
32:35	"OK, thank you."	  
32:35	"OK, I believe those are all my questions then."	  
32:45	Any other thoughts that you haven't shared already about managing finances?	  
32:52	No.	  
32:54	"OK, then that yeah, that is it for us."	  
32:59	So appreciate your time.
