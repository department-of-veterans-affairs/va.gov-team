# **P08**

## **General info**

#### Involvement with VA

* Separated 2015  
* Enrolled in VA healthcare in 2010

#### App / website experience

* Use mobile app and website almost daily.  
* App \- primarly for communicating with providers, scheduling appointments, general communcation, medications  
* Use app \- easier, and always have a phone not a laptop. When employed can't always use a laptop. Use the phone for convinence and primary communications.

## **Interview (before screen sharing)**

#### Benefit overpayment experience

* Know how to check payments, and is \[disability rating\] and fully vested in using tools.  
* Hasn't had an overpayment, but is aware of what overpayments are.

#### Copayment experience

* Use medical copays and used that up until \[disability rating\]  
* Initially do not think the app was developed, but was receiving physical bills in the bill. Opted into paperless.  
* Always knew that the copays were coming. Use to receiving EOBs and terminology for after appointment communications.

#### when are you managing debts and bills?

* Bills have always been a thing. Friday or Saturday when there is down time and away from work, is when he is paying his bills.  
* A methodical process. Paid on the 1st and 15th and those were key sit down moments to review bills. Maybe as a paper that came in the mail, or whatever seemed urgent. Sometime bills were due to timing (kid's school physicals, etc.)  
* Coordinating with their partner about paying bills.

#### How they organize thoughts of debt and bills

#### How they manage payments

* Rely on a calendar and make sure that the bill took place on the actual date. Always been aware of the moving parts and being able to track bills.  
* Had a physical file cabinet in the house. Now, physically get everything digitized and goes into Google Drive. The same process but just digitized.  
* Challenging: when you receive multiple bills, go to the hospital and for one visit saw multiple providers and they came as several bills and NOT just one. Challenging to keep up and feel confident that they saw that person and owe that money.  
* A coordination of care would improve. "No surprise" bill if they don't see the bill upfront they won't get a surprise bill in the mail. Feels like this has been resolved for him.

#### Do they look at both at same time?

## **Prototype: current experience**

### Dashboard (buttons for overpayment, copay, and combined statement)

#### overall thoughts

* I would want to look at copays and overpayments separately. Inclined to look at the 2 copays and then the 3 overpays.  
* There could be a time when looking at the combined statements, but would need to look at this first to understand.

#### when would they use each one?

#### would combined statement increase/decrease trust?

### Combined statement .gov replica

#### How does it compare to what you were expecting?

* Confused. I see a lot more amounts than what was the overpays and copays were saying that. Now I have to do a deep dive into why I don't see the initial six.  
* There are payments, amounts. I'm not tracking if these amounts are outstanding or not. These are not very clear. I It looks like if it has a negatie sign it's a due and positive it's been paid.  
* Should I assume that all those totals add up and is correct. I would expect to see a running balance. List current and past billing. It appears that newest on top and oldest on bottom.

#### What would make it useful?

* I like the action of being able to resolve.  
* Running balance  
* What exactly the numbers mean.  
* Would want more explantation as to where the payment came from. More detail. Wants more detail in the description field

#### When would you use it?

#### Overwhelm?

#### Actions or decisions from viewing this?

#### Format? (email, app, PDF, etc).

### Combined statement PDF

#### Download combined statement: clear?

* It is going to be a PDF of everything below it.  
* The PDF is too small, but liked the zoom feature.  
* Likes the download summary more than the previous page. This tells me line by line what the charges are for. It looks like an explantation of benefits (EOB).  
* The dates line up to services, and services line up to a dollar amount. This is much better as to what it means to me as a consumer.

#### Current PDF usage on phone?

#### Would PDF of combined statement be useful?

* Yes, this is something that I would download and view this in my Google drive.

#### How does it compare to what you were expecting?

#### What would make it useful?

#### When would you use it?

* I would check this PDF against my calendar that lines up with my appointments and then feel confident to make a payment.

### Individual statements: copays

#### How does this compare to combined statement?

#### When would you use this vs combined statement?

#### Is one more useful than other?

### Individual statements: overpayments

#### How does this compare to combined statement?

* This is better than screen 1 (VA.gov combined statement)  
* I like this, and gives a date as to when the balance is due. I feel comfortable of resolving the overpayment.  
* Still confused by the confused balance? I would want to know what the differene between the current and orginal balance. Participant is missing the transaction history drop down.

#### When would you use this vs combined statement?

#### Is one more useful than other?

### Review of combined statement (some questions will be repeats from earlier)

#### What info is important regarding financial situation?

* I would like to see something more descriptive than balanace increase or balanace decrease.

#### When would you use combined statement vs individual

* The more time that I have to hit a button, would appreciate a clear comprehensive overview.

#### would combined statement increase/decrease trust?

* I would trust the PDF version of the One VA Debt Letter, b/c their was more detail and see all the transactions.

#### when are you managing debts and bills?

## **Prototype: future experience**

### First version of combined statement

#### Which version? (A or B)

* B

#### What are your thoughts?

* Likes the copays and overpays tab and like having the option right there.  
* I don't see the dates. I want to see the date of service.  
* I want to see the event and the date that took place. I would assume clicking on the "review and resolve overpayment".  
* Doesn't see the running total. I assume that the date is the service date and is what they are looking for.

#### Would you use this?

* This is beneficial to me.

#### When might you use this?

* Like the tabs for personal business, but use the PDF for record keeping. I would use both (the overpay/copay view \+ PDF)

#### Trust

### Second version of combined statement

#### Which version? (A or B)

* A

#### What are your thoughts?

#### Compare to other version

* See Veteran information and didn't see that before.  
* Emily had to explain the difference between A and B.

#### Which do you prefer?

* Version A

### Overall thoughts on combined statement

#### What changes would you make?

### Individual statement

#### Which one are they viewing? (overpay or copay)

* Copays

#### When might you use this vs combined statement?

* Confused why there is just the last 6 month data. Not sure the intent of 6 months and wants more clarity.  
* Gives today date, but doesn't tie it to the date of service. Wants to know why they owe this charge and found that info under recent statement charges.

### Wrap-up

#### Where would you expect to find combined statement?

#### Other thoughts on combined statement?

* Preference is the combined statement and likes having the two tabs. Plus would like the PDF statement.

#### Other thoughts on managing finances?

#### Other topics

* Community care get's lost and it's very cluncky. No link between the community care system and VA system. Participant has to go to different websites.
