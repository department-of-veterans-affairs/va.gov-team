## **General info**

#### Involvement with VA

* Separated 2002  
* Pretty good garden variety between healthcare, disability and compensation, GI bill, I also have a VA home loan.

#### App / website experience

* I use both as the app has improved, I've leaned more towards using the app that using the site itself. First off with it being, I'm mostly on my phone. So they're not using a browser on my phone .. as opposed to an app where it's visually better... easier to navigate... I remember the passwords and have them saved but it just looks at your face and you're in.  
* App is easier to see what's ready to refill and everything else to do those. So that's the biggest use I get out of it. Can screenshot and text appointment information to his supervisor

## **Interview (before screen sharing)**

#### Benefit overpayment experience

#### Copayment experience

* I think when I went from \[disability rating\] there was a little bit of an overpayment on that. So there was that, and then in the reverse overpayment. I'm still in the process of trying to get this one rectified, but in May, I went from \[higher disability rating\]. And they backgated it to May of 2023, so I'm still in the process of trying to get the co-pays that I did have refunded. So, an over-app agreement by what I overpaid.  
* "Has not received copays since may  
*  Learned of copays by a letter in the mail in advance. The bill would be deducted from benefits. If you didn't take care of the bill, they would take care of it that way.  
*  Was aware he could pay on pay.gov"  
* "That's the most of it I remember, you would get statements and if it drug out too long, they would say hey there's gonna be a deduction.  
*  My primary carer's biggest thing was that she was not ever coding my service-connected medicine as being service-connected."  
* "Usually just looks at statements; saw where they were but never went there and looked.   
*  Probably just laziness because I knew it would come to me, so just take care of it when it gets here"

#### when are you managing debts and bills?

* At work I generally don't do any calls or anything like that. I figured the budget while I was at work, I work as \[redacted\]…. in the down time between calls it's one of the things I may do  
* "Usually that's going in once a two-week period.   
* (Coincides with when he's receiving payments)"

#### How they organize thoughts of debt and bills

#### How they manage payments

* I have an excel spreadsheet that I've made formulas for to manage a couple different accounts. I have one where all my direct deposits go into, I want to work, I transfer money over to that one for the bills to come out of.  
* "\[Confusing?\] I've kind of got it down. I've shared that spreadsheet, which actually will, like,  
*  in a mentoring way with younger coworkers to kind of help them, too. So, yeah. I've got a blank version that I could give out at any moment."

#### Do they look at both at same time?

 

## **Prototype: current experience**

### Dashboard (buttons for overpayment, copay, and combined statement)

#### overall thoughts

#### when would they use each one?

* I think I'd like it available every time because I like to be able to itemize what each portion is to understand each charge. If it was combined and didn't break down, that version would not be good to me.

#### would combined statement increase/decrease trust?

### Combined statement .gov replica

#### How does it compare to what you were expecting?

* The overpayment charges portion, I think I would rather see the total amounts and then have like a dropdown option in this section. I was pretty well aware and didn't have any concerns that anything was off. I could faster scroll down to, let's say, this portion of the GI Bill.  
* "Would like to see the summarized version with the way to dig into the details  
*   I said a dropdown, I really should have said an expansion because I don't want to see it in a scrolling format of you know, pick one."

#### What would make it useful?

#### When would you use it?

#### Overwhelm?

* Probably a 6 just because you automatically have to go through each and every one, every little incidents.

#### Actions or decisions from viewing this?

* "Billing reference isn't clear and not useful   
*  thinks it would be better to state the month it was from mentioned J32 vs O32 for October"

#### Format? (email, app, PDF, etc)

* If accordion aspect resolved and a PDF download; would like a physical copy in front of me to highlight the ones I need to discuss and take notes out to the side and things like that

### Combined statement PDF

#### Download combined statement: clear?

* That format seems sufficient

#### Current PDF usage on phone?

* Yeah, absolutely  
* Also saves PDFs on phone

#### Would PDF of combined statement be useful?

* I could see good reasons for both. I wouldn't rate one over the other.

#### How does it compare to what you were expecting?

#### What would make it useful?

#### When would you use it?

### Individual statements: copays

#### How does this compare to combined statement?

#### When would you use this vs combined statement?

* That's not a big deal. I kinda like them separated. I guess it's probably just the way my brain likes to compartmentalize things.. one is straight up a bill, and the other one is an error in my favor that turned out to not be in my favor...

#### Is one more useful than other?

### Individual statements: overpayments

#### How does this compare to combined statement?

* This is definitely a lot more visually appealing and user friendly because I have the option to review details and I can look at this portion.... this one is more in line with kind of what I prefer

#### When would you use this vs combined statement?

#### Is one more useful than other?

### Review of combined statement (some questions will be repeats from earlier)

#### What info is important regarding financial situation?

#### When would you use combined statement vs individual

* Only if I knew there were error that I needed to discuss

#### would combined statement increase/decrease trust?

#### when are you managing debts and bills?

## **Prototype: future experience**

### First version of combined statement

#### Which version? (A or B)

* B

#### What are your thoughts?

* Overall I like this one better than the other previous one where you were forced to look at every line item.  
* It's quicker and easier for me to see the overall amounts and then if I feel like I need to look into it, I've got the topion to look at it without being forced.  
* This is easier than separate screens

#### Would you use this?

#### When might you use this?

#### Trust

* No, it's the same information just displayed differently. It's just that this current one fits my preferences and the way I like to see things.  
* \[PDF need\] Previous to going 50%, I would say it was something I would require at this point, not as much just because I don't have copays anymore.  
* \[Would you still want PDF\] Either combination would be able to work for me

### Second version of combined statement

#### Which version? (A or B)

* A

#### What are your thoughts?

* It looks to be just font size differences. That's the only thing I can really notice.

#### Compare to other version

#### Which do you prefer?

* B \- removes some unneccessary stuff that I don't particularly need

### Overall thoughts on combined statement

#### What changes would you make?

* I guess maybe for the previous situation I was in, if left unpaid, something will come out of your benefits check for X month. So that way you know ahead of time because sometimes the letter would say one thing but then something else might adhere to that in between that time period and more would come out than what I expected.

### Individual statement

#### Which one are they viewing? (overpay or copay)

#### When might you use this vs combined statement?
