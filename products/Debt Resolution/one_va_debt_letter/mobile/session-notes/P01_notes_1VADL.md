## **Interview (before screen sharing)**

#### Benefit overpayment experience

* "Comfortable talking about this \- has a lot to do with GI Bill, had something called a top-up for educational benefits;  
*  miscommunication that he used too many benefits"  
* Learned about it through a letter from Montgomery, AL in a manilla large envelope \- looked official; the overpayments showed up before the letters did so it was an eye-opening experience (a statement of what was owed) then more official letter came  
* Next steps, options clear? Yes, it explained itself to me. It was detailed and included information about how to file a grievance or dispute

#### Copayment experience

* Has copays; rated as partially disabled  
* Later had more disabilities that were approved that raised his rating higher which moved him to a new tier so his copays aren't as high \- app helps keep him aware of what is owed

#### when are you managing debts and bills?

* Does this first of the month at home to give him idea of where he is financially to start budgeting  
* Calendar prompts him to manage

#### How they organize thoughts of debt and bills

* Thinks of it as one thing \- money owed to the government  
* Uses spreadsheet and keeps an eye on va.gov and the app  
* My VA homepage \- shows appointments, open claims, copays, can usually thumb down and sees it all in the app periodically throughout the month (receiving letters prompts checking the web and app)

#### How they manage payments

#### Do they look at both at same time?

* Pays both at the same time

#### Challenging/confusing?

* Not as overwhelming as when he started receiving those. It's almost second-nature now.  
* Mentions ideas of how to lower costs of drugs so copays wouldn't be as high

## **Prototype: current experience**

#### Technical difficulties with Figma and/or sharing screen?

* No

### Dashboard (buttons for overpayment, copay, and combined statement)

#### overall thoughts

* Combined statement \= total bill  
* Total bill of what I owe would be helpful

#### when would they use each one?

* Once a week (maybe Friday or pay day) to look at each one individually  
* When receiving a letter in the mail

#### would combined statement increase/decrease trust?

* Would trust everything in once place \[combined statement\] \- but they're pretty much the same \[58:00ish\]

### Combined statement .gov replica

#### How does it compare to what you were expecting?

* This is more like each individual payment and what it's for. I think that's really helpful. It shows the previous balance. If you're trying to remember what the bill was for... this is very helpful  
* It's almost like a one-stop-shop and it's self explanitory. I think it would really help out

#### What would make it useful?

* Showing where the payment was coming from (which account like showing part of the account number)

#### When would you use it?

* First of the month when budgeting  
* Would maybe use it now more often to see what my balance decreases are  
* Transaction history \- would like to see a year

#### Overwhelm?

* 1 \- not overwhelming at all

#### Actions or decisions from viewing this?

* I do like that there's an option to review and resolve so I could pay it off if I could. Also likes the phone number to discuss payment options  
* Great tool to be able to see everything all at once

#### Format? (email, app, PDF, etc)

* With this amount of information, it's great to have it on the phone, but at the beginning of the month, would like it printed or on a larger screen to not make mistakes  
* Likes to print things out to physically see and have for records \- cell or computer could be down

### Combined statement PDF

#### Download combined statement: clear?

* That will put it in a PDF file that he would be able to save or print

#### Current PDF usage on phone?

* Yes \- tickets usually goes to a PDF file  
* Saves to download file

#### Would PDF of combined statement be useful?

* Yes

#### How does it compare to what you were expecting?

* This looks like something they would send me in the mail. I would definitely hang onto this. It has the VA insignia and file number. I would keep it for my records if I printed it.

#### What would make it useful?

#### When would you use it?

* Could print from phone (has wifi printer), could also send it if there was financial assistance needed  
* Would use HTML statement for own viewing and the PDF when he's budgeting

### Individual statements: copays

#### How does this compare to combined statement?

#### When would you use this vs combined statement?

#### Is one more useful than other?

### Individual statements: overpayments

#### How does this compare to combined statement?

* This is more of what you have left. This could resolve it all at one time or maybe you could break it down. Hopefully by pressing that, it would take me to another page so I can say how much I want to pay on it or resolving the current balance

#### When would you use this vs combined statement?

* This is something to use when I'm getting ready to make a payment (vs understanding with the combined statement)  
* If I wanted to physically speak to someone, I would use the other one. If I was making a payment, I would use this one.

#### Is one more useful than other?

* Combined statement is more useful to know where I'm making a payment to as opposed to this one it looks like I'm paying a full debt off

### Review of combined statement (some questions will be repeats from earlier)

#### What info is important regarding financial situation?

* DMC phone number really helps to make sure I'm making payments on time or to ask for an extension \- could help me with options

#### When would you use combined statement vs individual

#### would combined statement increase/decrease trust?

* I think it lays it all out if I have a discrepancy. It helps seeing it spread out like that.

#### when are you managing debts and bills?

## **Prototype: future experience**

### First version of combined statement

#### Which version? (A or B)

* A

#### What are your thoughts?

* Ah it's kinda like the combined statement and showing the balances. I think it's a good layout. Likes the combined PDF statement button at top  
* Switches between the two tabs \- it's handy and once again I have the combined statement I could print out

#### Would you use this?

* Would view PDF on phone before printing; Likes how everything is together on the PDF  
* Would prefer everything on one page  
* Nothing missing

#### When might you use this?

* I would probably use it if not as frequent as the other one. I'm more or less likely to print my statement. I probably wouldn't use it as much because I have to go between different tabs.

#### Trust

* Would trust everything in once place \[combined statement\] \- but they're pretty much the same \[58:00ish\]  
* Would go to combined statement first

### Second version of combined statement

#### Which version? (A or B)

* B

#### What are your thoughts?

* You have to use the arrows to open. A shows exactly what's due and why \- not blindsided

#### Compare to other version

* Rather see reason up front \[in A\]  
* Want menus with arrows expanded  
* Would like copays/overpayments in same tab

#### Which do you prefer?

* A

### Overall thoughts on combined statement

#### What changes would you make?

* Rather see reason up front  
* Want menus with arrows expanded  
* Would like copays/overpayments in same tab

### Individual statement

#### Which one are they viewing? (overpay or copay)

#### When might you use this vs combined statement?

* Would use this to jolt my memory. I like how it has all the PDFs for the past 6 months. I think that's a great feature to have.... be able to download and print it for my records  
* To refresh my memory of balance details, the breakdown of that full payment due
