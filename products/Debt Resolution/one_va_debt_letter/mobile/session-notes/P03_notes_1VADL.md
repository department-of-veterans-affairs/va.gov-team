## **Interview (before screen sharing)**

#### Benefit overpayment experience

* I had some this year. Came across some hardship earlier this year. I had some debt that needed to be taken care of. Knew of the debt but kind of forgot about it \- thinks he got something in the mail \- believes he knew it was coming but just forgot  
* Options not really clear but he called them. They offered financial options. It won't go to the credit bureau. Learned about on the phone  
* Set up payment plan by calling them

#### Copayment experience

* Knows a little bit about it. Usually has the money for medical copays \- mentions getting copay bills  
* Knows the bills come but isn't sure how long it will take, it isn't always clear what the copay is for  
* Doesn't remember financial options being in the bills, outside of the mail and the app, that's it for communications. Physical letters catch attention more

#### when are you managing debts and bills?

* More at the beginning of the month (rent, electricity, cell phone) big chunk and then also has some bills due in the middle of the month \- has changed due dates purposely  
* Usually at house when managing bills  
* Due dates or interest charges also prompt and grab attention

#### How they organize thoughts of debt and bills

* Challenging/confusing \- normal bills are recurring and VA bills are less frequent sometimes I get lost and forget about them (a couple times a year)  
* Reminders would be helpful and more communication about financial options

#### How they manage payments

* Pays them separately \- copays always cheaper

#### Do they look at both at same time?

* Thinks of them separately \- copays are more upfront, overpayments are more whenever

## **Prototype: current experience**

#### overall thoughts

* Wants them separate like we have them

#### when would they use each one?

* No changes, I like to keep it simple KISS

### Individual statement

* Overpayment

#### When might you use this vs combined statement?

* Might look at them both, might share combined, but for personal use would prefer to look at them separately  
* Likes individual more \- more blunt, bold \- makes me want to take action more  
* If I'm trying to pay the whole thing, I'd probably go to the combined statement

### Wrap-up

#### Where would you expect to find combined statement?

* At the bottom of overpayments

#### Other thoughts on combined statement?

* If I want to get the overview of all my bills, the combined statement makes sense, or if I want to print it out or show to financial advisors. In general, I would not use the combined statement. I'm the type of person, I want to attack one bill at a time.

#### Other thoughts on managing finances?

* The app makes life easier. I want everything to be very simple and intuitive, easy on my eyes.  
* I don't like to zoom on the PDF \- that's why it's better on the laptop. Would rather concentrate on one thing at a time on the phone  
* Options to resolve one bill at a time
