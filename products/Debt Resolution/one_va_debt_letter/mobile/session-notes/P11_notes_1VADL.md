## **General info**

#### Separated 2014

* It was very limited for the first basically until this year essentially I would have sign up ... after the PACT Act was passed, and I realized I had access to some things I didn't know about .. I probably should've known about it but I didn't. I would've signed up in \[year\] for just the standard VA health care and then I would have done my first claim this year.  
* Basically, I had, like, minimal interaction until this year, around March, April, when I started, like, actually using VA healthcare.

#### "Use both mainly would've been this year 

*  Website will probably have more information. I use the app regularly at least on a monthly basis and then on the webiste it has everything on there."  
* "App \- mainly be, um…anymore, it would just be…  
*  I'm trying to remember if there's… so mainly, it's just to check on the compensation and benefits, um, like, uh, whenever they're due, uh, or, you know, whenever they're getting close to being due. Trying to think what else I go into the app for. If I need to get a letter, um…like, if there's something that I'm submitting for or whatever, and I need a verification letter or whatever, I will go to the app, pretty quick to go in there. You can just go, um, it's the bottom tab, like, I think it's under benefits, so you can…  
*  You can click on the various letters and, like, customize it to whatever you need. So I do go there, because it's a lot… it's quicker for me just to do that, and then email it to myself and print it out"  
* Really the app would be more compensation stuff and website is just more other stuff

## **Interview (before screen sharing)**

#### Benefit overpayment experience

* No experience outside of copays

#### Copayment experience

* Got a notice in the mail and it is still showing on the VA. They're claiming it's a debt I owe but I don't quite understand. I got the letter in the mail, and then I also have a notice on the VA website. It's like still showing from September. It's a copayment that is due to \[location\] ... paid but it's still showing. Mentions another copay this summer he's paid that went away.  
* "I thought it was clear when I went on the website, and then… because I think even the letter, I'd have to see… I'd have to go through my paperwork and, like, look at the letter again, but, like, you go to the Treasury, like, I think you go to treasury.gov, or it's…  
*  It's another… it's not the VA where you… where I go and pay it.   
*  I was under the understanding that you just go there, and then you enter, there's something about a code  
*  Um, you would enter your information and you would pay it, but I did that. And then unfortunately, though when I go back into it, unless you... I'm trying to remember now, unless you would have used, like, the code that was in the letter, they have no record of your payment, so I'm like, I don't really know where to go with it at this point.  
*  That was just, like, the frustrating thing, because it… I don't know if the letter was reflecting everything on when you go onto your VA.gov site, uh, because they do say on the site that, like, unless you have the code, we have no way of tracking.... and so then the VA's like, we can't… we can't tell you whether that got paid or not, basically. So I'm like, great."  
* "It's still showing over 2 months now (since September 15th) so I would probably need to reach out.  
*   I honestly don't know what number to… I don't know if you just call the regular 1-800 number, or, um…  
*  they may say… maybe it says on VA.gov who I could call, but, like, that would be my next step that I would have to do at this point, because it doesn't look like it's gonna…"

#### when are you managing debts and bills?

* "So everything would be automated. I do try to have alerts set up really tied to credit and debit cards. I've set it almost, the, like, really low, because I've kind of gotten, like, burned. I'm sure we all have you know, for the unauthorized charges, I want to catch them as quick as I can.   
*   Maybe a lot of Americans are doing that now, but, like, I do monitor that closely, um, for the usage, whatever, um, but that…  
*  That would, you know, that all my bills would be, um…you know, deduct… or they're automatically paid on the due date."  
* "It would get confirmed because I always get an email. I do check my statement though to make sure it's debited.  
*   Um, it's getting taken out, like, just so you can plan. You always want to make sure there's enough in there, of course. So, like…  
*  Um, so yeah, like, I usually will get an email to confirm it, and then I do verify it, um, in the various apps I have for, like, the  
*  Um, you know, for your debit, like, your banking accounts."  
* "Prompts: what would prompt me to do it is just to make sure that I'm coming in behind it, just to make sure that there… that you have enough for each month, so… I don't necessarily, when I say verify, I'm not verifying, like, with my gas and electric bill, that the day it comes out, but I want to make sure  
*  like, I did… it's on the front or back end. You want to make sure that there's enough, obviously, in the account.  
*  like, before you pay it, and then for any subsequent bill after, you want to make sure that it's taken out, or whatever.  
*   Make sure it's accounted for  
*   Has a Google calendar for every bill \- the big ones at least, the date it's supposed to be deducted is on my calendar so that would pop up on the day it's due. That week I'll take a look and see this week, I've got this."  
* \[Alerts\] Text alerts for gas, electric, internet, I can't remember if cable is in there. From the provider I sign up so I know when the bill's been issued and when it's been paid.

#### How they organize thoughts of debt and bills

* How they manage payments  
* Do they look at both at same time?

## **Prototype: current experience**

### Dashboard (buttons for overpayment, copay, and combined statement)

#### overall thoughts

* "My initial thought is I do like it together. So is the combined statement something I would be on the download? Is that…  
*  Um, or would it just appear on the app, I guess? But either way, either way, I do like… I do like that, that I can see it all right there, like, that was my initial reaction."

#### when would they use each one?

#### would combined statement increase/decrease trust?

### Combined statement .gov replica

#### How does it compare to what you were expecting?

* It's detailed and I guess the only... there wouldn't be... it's totaled up.... I guess you're covering everything that a veteran would potentially financially touch... yeah I mean it makes sense to me  
* "I understand why that happened, because that's showing… because if… I guess what I'm seeing…  
*  It would be…  
*  Every month, there would have been a change, I guess, when this was…  
*  discovered, I guess, or whatever. So, it makes sense, like,  
*  I'm sure when you add it all up, like, the pluses and the minuses, that's how you get down to the total. That was a little hard to follow."

#### What would make it useful?

* I guess my first question would be, I guess this is just a statement. My question would be how to resolve it but that appears to be a link. This makes sense to me. It's explaining where it happens. That would answer my questions reviewing this page for myself

#### When would you use it?

#### Overwhelm?

* 1

#### Actions or decisions from viewing this?

* Medical stuff, no becuase I should be able to know that those visits happened. The disability and compensation, that's probably straightforward.  
* "This wouldn't be the first time you're hearing of it, you should know what is happening behind the scenes.  
* Why the decrease? I would assume it wouldn't be the first time seeing it but if it is you really wouldn't have any idea"

#### Format? (email, app, PDF, etc)

* I would like to interact with it in the app. It's right near my homescreen. It's easier to log into, you can verify your identity just with a face scan. The more I can do in the app, the better for me, personally. ... The more I can do in the app, that to me is where I like it.

### Combined statement PDF

#### Download combined statement: clear?

* Expects downloadable version of the page he viewed  
* Yeah, well actually wait this seems more detailed. On first glance, there seems to be more entries  
* Smaller print and more lines; appears to be more individual entries; reads more like a financial document I suppose

#### Current PDF usage on phone?

#### Would PDF of combined statement be useful?

* "I would, yeah, I would like to use it, because, like, this is something that, um…if you're so inclined, you could historically save this, like, this could be part of your  
*  documentation that you keep, just for tracking of your own purposes, rather than, like, you know, the actual web page, like, this is something you can save, and if, like, you're one of those guys, you could store it, and then use it for whatever, you know, budgeting or whatever purposes you want to use it for in the future, like, it's a searchable document"  
* More than likely I would just view and save, I wouldn't print it  
* Like having the PDF option but prefers the combined statement

#### How does it compare to what you were expecting?

#### What would make it useful?

#### When would you use it?

### Individual statements: copays

#### How does this compare to combined statement?

* "It makes sense to me. It's an easy way to care of your copay bill. It's right up front. I like it because I can I guess the details...   
*  I think that's helpful."

#### When would you use this vs combined statement?

#### Is one more useful than other?

### Individual statements: overpayments

#### How does this compare to combined statement?

* This also I do like. It gives you the balance. I like it. I like it because the balance are there and it gives you the option of resolving it in I guess one click

#### When would you use this vs combined statement?

#### Is one more useful than other?

* "Prefers them individually  
*  it's right there, and then assuming everything is on… you're in agreement with, you can resolve it, like, immediately, you can review the details with the same amount of… like, you can review the details easily, and resolve"

### Review of combined statement (some questions will be repeats from earlier)

#### What info is important regarding financial situation?

#### When would you use combined statement vs individual

#### would combined statement increase/decrease trust?

* "the long… the A version would seem more trustworthy it seemed to be more detailed initially   
*  the one with tabs"

#### when are you managing debts and bills?

## **Prototype: future experience**

### First version of combined statement

#### Which version? (A or B)

* B

#### What are your thoughts?

* I do like this. It's intuitive, I guess. I don't know you can tell you can open this up \[accordion\]  
* "Mentions clinics split up \- the total bill and it all comes from the below  
*   The most important thing is right up front, what I owe"  
* "\[Viewing overpayments tab\] It would be the same thing as far as my impression of it  
*   If you have any questions of when it started, that's listed there. It tells you right up from what you owe. Those tabs look good to me"

#### Would you use this?

#### When might you use this?

* "I would want to use this. If I was under the impression, I was right and VA was wrong, use the PDF view. Same information  
*  As long as you don't have an issue with what you're seeing, you can resolve your situation a lot sooner... that's why I like the app it speeds up your decisions and resolution I think quicker"

#### Trust

### Second version of combined statement

#### Which version? (A or B)

* A

#### What are your thoughts?

* I'm not sure if I see... I can't remember if the total due was at the top for A. I'd have to go back and look. They both seem itemized more or less and have balance due  
* Usefulness of blurb: That is useful. The Veteran should have an understanding. I wouldn't mind seeing what priority group I'm in. I think they're 1-8 or something like that. That would be my only thing. It is useful.

#### Compare to other version

#### Which do you prefer?

* B \- like it collapsed it allows me to open it if I want to

### Overall thoughts on combined statement

#### What changes would you make?

### Individual statement

#### Which one are they viewing? (overpay or copay)

#### When might you use this vs combined statement?

### Wrap-up

#### Where would you expect to find combined statement?

#### Other thoughts on combined statement?

#### Other thoughts on managing finances?

* The more that it does allow to me to do it within the app just makes it easier and quicker for me rather than logging into the computer.
