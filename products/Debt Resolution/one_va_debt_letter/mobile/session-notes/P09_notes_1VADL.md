## **General info**

#### Involvement with VA

* separated around 2014  
* "Very interactive, utilizing health services avidly   
*  I've been in different groups, different study groups, um, and now going back to school, and of course, you know, the school's a little different sometimes, but now I'm going back to school, utilizing my VA benefits for that as well, so…  
*  very active involvement."

#### App / website experience

* Using VA website a little bit more, I've always been using the My HealtheVet  
* Using the website but not the app on your phone  
* Always on my phone and tablet, more frequent on phone; convenience

## **Interview (before screen sharing)**

#### Benefit overpayment experience

* I haven't gotten anything for that. I haven't received anything that I'm aware of about that.  
* I would hope to have some type of communication to tell me that I'm, you know, that there is a benefit that they overpaid ahead of time, or somebody calls me to tell me that, because that was, especially with those type of benefits being so excessive, I mean, the copay seemed pretty low, but those benefits usually are pretty hefty dollar amount, so something like that, I would definitely want to know ahead of time that… what to expect, or get some type of call and, you know, let me know.

#### Copayment experience

* "Getting letters in the mail and things like that so I've been trying to understand where it's coming from in one instance....  
*   Penny pinching, Looking for a clear understanding for those copays;   
*   Read up on VA website"  
* "Some of them have been a surprise due to the medication. I didn't know that would be part of the copay. I'll go and then get a bill for my meds. It's confusing what's a copay   
*   More communication / information prior to receiving the bill would be helpful for me so I can kind of figure it out; maybe a little more heads up  
*   Usually see the bill about a month after."  
* "It gives me the amount. At the bottom of the bill, it has a number and website. I think it directs me back to the VA website. It's not hard but it's just those 2 things at the bottom of the page to call or go to the VA website.  
*   Prefers the website to make payments"

#### when are you managing debts and bills?

* Usually manage based on my kind of pay periods, so I try to get in there at least obviously the month before. Prior month get everything down what I'm expecting. Have everything on a spreadsheet  
* I'm checking it daily just to make sure that everything aligns with what I, um, what's going out, and what's, you know, what obviously what's coming out of the bank account, just to make sure that I'm good, and that paid it.  
* "Mentions calendar on phone with some bills  
*   So if my pay period lands on, like, let's just say, for example, the 15th, I'm trying to get everything from the 1st to the 14th or 15th, and pay it with, you know,  
*  Around that time, and then, you know, managing it from… and then anything, like, to the end of the month, whatever that check is, kind of…  
*  planning around those, uh, dates so that it's paid around that time."

#### How they organize thoughts of debt and bills

#### How they manage payments

* "I kind of put in two separate spreadsheets. I put one with all of my bills, um, for the month. I lay it out, all of this is what's going on. Then in a separate spreadsheet, I break out my payment, my paychecks, and I put those bills that are due for that check, and I put everything that's due in what I have, um, what's owed and what I'm going to have left over in that check, and then same for the second pay period, or the third, if that lands in that month, and then tells me what my overage is for the month.  
*  Yeah, just using those spreadsheets, honestly, throughout the time I've kind of had to create a system that's a system I've managed. I'm able to, but just going back and forth to that spreadsheet on my phone or on my tablet."  
* "\[Anything you would want from the VA?\]   
*  Would prefer faster communication; maybe get a text or email"

#### Do they look at both at same time?

## **Prototype: current experience**

### Dashboard (buttons for overpayment, copay, and combined statement)

#### overall thoughts

* Assuming combined statement is overpayments and copays combined

#### when would they use each one?

* If I see some in both of them, that would be my trigger to check. If I just had a visit, I would check. I'm an avid apper, so I think I'm always going to check.... just maybe sporadically; maybe once or twice a week  
* Would like to look at everything together

#### would combined statement increase/decrease trust?

### Combined statement .gov replica

#### How does it compare to what you were expecting?

* It's helpful but I think it's just so much on one screen. Maybe if filtering sorting so you can drill down and see what you want to see

#### What would make it useful?

* "Reading down, reading down maybe the total if it's breaking it down line by line  
*  mentions $35.00 previous balance then sees total at the bottom of list"  
* VA likes to have it scrolling down, everything on one screen. It's not bad but it's kinda blocky. If I'm on my phone I'll have to go through everything a little bit slower just to make sure I didn't miss anything..... just because there's so much on one page.  
* "Does this tell you the overpayment balance increase \- what the timeframe is or what it's stemming from  
*  Is there a way to filter the date range? I like to filter to be able to see current or like 2025, 24 because it's giving me everything again"

#### When would you use it?

* If I'm trying to take care of both debts at the same time, I would look at both of them.... Budget-wise I'm trying to take care of what's due first

#### Overwhelm?

* 3  
* \[Less overwhelming?\] I think that's it \[filtering and sorting\]  
* Maybe automatic scroll to the top too

#### Actions or decisions from viewing this?

#### Format? (email, app, PDF, etc)

* Oh man, if was probably begging too much if I said all of them. I like the fact that I can see them here. Now I can see it in the app, and in the desktop.... If I want to point out something at the doctor make sure it matches....  
* Print it off

### Combined statement PDF

#### Download combined statement: clear?

* Would give history of both my copay and overpayments  
* "Good way to condense everything in one  
*  I would come here first instead of scrolling"

#### Current PDF usage on phone?

* Would use it on the phone, if it's something I can't see, make it bigger

#### Would PDF of combined statement be useful?

#### How does it compare to what you were expecting?

#### What would make it useful?

#### When would you use it?

### Individual statements: copays

#### How does this compare to combined statement?

* I would defintely use this. I do like the way it's laid out. I will use this more so when I'm alerted that Ihave a copay, based on the x amount of notification, or email or inmail. This is when I would be prompted to come here.  
* Is this more like current or this is more past due in this typical scenario?

#### When would you use this vs combined statement?

* When I have a bill, I'll pop in here real fast. It's more convenient and quick.

#### Is one more useful than other?

* "they would be beneficial in their own way, because again, I'm quicker at…  
*  get to this, um, it can be done, but if I want to get a little bit more deeper dive into the, uh, my… both of my bills and the subsets of the bills, and I'll look into, you know, my combined statement. So they both have different beneficial parts."

### Individual statements: overpayments

#### How does this compare to combined statement?

#### When would you use this vs combined statement?

#### Is one more useful than other?

### Review of combined statement (some questions will be repeats from earlier)

#### What info is important regarding financial situation?

#### When would you use combined statement vs individual

#### would combined statement increase/decrease trust?

* Don't know if I would trust one more than the other. If one is showing something different then...

#### when are you managing debts and bills?

## **Prototype: future experience**

### First version of combined statement

#### Which version? (A or B)

* B

#### What are your thoughts?

* I love the toggles. I love that you can toggle between one or the other and not have to leave the screens  
* Where does it? \[scrolls back up and sees resolve button\]  
* "I like the cascading sections. I can open and close it if I don't want to see it anymore.

#### Would you use this?

* I would be very likely to use this.   
*  It's very clear"

#### When might you use this?

* I would add it to my rotation of app usage; checking weekly  
* Nothing missing  
* "PDF would still be good if I have additional questions to verify what's there. In here, I would look if a balance is off. Would there be a character limit to the description?   
*  If I'm not seeing everything I need, that would be the only reason to jump to a full statement"

#### Trust

### Second version of combined statement

#### Which version? (A or B)

* A

#### What are your thoughts?

#### Compare to other version

* Something different in total owed, I think it's just the layout at the beginning. Date due is missing

#### Which do you prefer?

* B  
* Prefer to have content collapsed; I don't really need to see that initially.

### Overall thoughts on combined statement

#### What changes would you make?

* Due date missing

### Individual statement

#### Which one are they viewing? (overpay or copay)

* Overpayments

#### When might you use this vs combined statement?

* I think it would just be what I'm looking at and what I'm trying to look for at the time.  
* \[Details\] This looks good actually. It gives me my transaction history.  
* "\[PDF versus details?\] No, I think it would just be, again, based on what I'm looking at, if I just get something in the mail, just comment. Well, and again, based on if I'm paying  
*  paying down that particular debt at the time, if I know I need to go ahead and get that done due to the time.  
*  then I'm just gonna go straight to that. \[Overpayments\]  
*  Would use PDF to check something that came up unexpected"

### Wrap-up

#### Where would you expect to find combined statement?

* That is a good question. I'm assuming it would be under the combined payments.  
* Navigates to Payment through the breadcrumbs  
* Maybe put a link to combined statement from overpayments

#### Other thoughts on combined statement?

#### Other thoughts on managing finances?

* No, I think I have some more exploring to do. I've been looking at different things in different areas, but I'm, you know, interested in what's new, so I'm just gonna, you know, think I have some more… some more research to do, too, as well. This gives me some more, um, that I need to potentially download the app as well to see if there's something that I can look at to help me better, um, my different areas of my life.

#### Copays via text or email... what would deserve an alert?

* "The new and the past due would be helpful to me. Prompting me to know it's there, it's due, and then maybe even after it's due. just that notification for me is really important, and even on my phone, if I get, like, a little band room notification that it's been… that something's there would help me, and then maybe after 30 days, like, hey, you haven't reviewed, if I haven't seen it or haven't reviewed it.  
*  Um, hey, don't forget, reminder. Don't forget you have a pending, you know, bill that you need to review, or overpayment that you need to review.  
*  Um, because, I mean, I'm avidly on my phone, so I'm just trying to make sure that I don't miss anything, you know, in my email.  
*  So, just wanted… as soon as maybe simultaneously an email and a notification,  
*  um, helps me a whole lot."
