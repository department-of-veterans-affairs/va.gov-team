# **P06**

## **General info**

#### Involvement with VA

* Separated 2023  
* Fairly light, thankfully I haven't had that many medical issues that require me to use VA that much. I do have an overpament probably earlier this year  
* Goes for medical care and such

#### App / website experience

* Both are fairly easy to navigate but doesn't have the app downloaded on his phone (Apple deletes apps) \- had it downloaded sometime after being discharged maybe early 2024  
* Checks benefits on website

## **Interview (before screen sharing)**

#### Benefit overpayment experience

* I had an overpayment earlier this year because I hadn't updated my income from 2024 so I had to repay it in 2025  
* "There was a letter sent in the mail and believes there was a notification when he logged in.  
*   I don't know if it was necessarily a surprise, but I know that it was possible."  
* "Understood why received it, income wasn't what I actually received  
*   Could do a compromise to negotiate it down or pay it over time"

#### Copayment experience

* I've had to pay for copays. Sometimes I'm not charged at the point of service so they're just added to my account  
* "Bill then notification  
*   Expected those to come"  
* I don't remember if I was offered a compromise, I just paid it up front

#### when are you managing debts and bills?

* Probably around the end of the month, most of my bills are actually due at the beginning of the following month so I just try to have it paid by the first few days of the end of the prior month  
* "Autopay usually helps a lot but other than that, I do keep a spreadsheet   
*   Spreedsheet has company I need to pay which is the bill, also money in checking account"  
* Usually at the end of the month, unless I get some notification via email about, like, some charge that, like, maybe I don't recognize, and then I have to do some further investigation.

#### How they organize thoughts of debt and bills

* Looking at history of both \- uh not really no

#### How they manage payments

* Pays at the same time around the end of the month

#### Do they look at both at same time?

* That's all one in the same, so I just think of it as a bill.

## **Prototype: current experience**

### Dashboard (buttons for overpayment, copay, and combined statement)

#### overall thoughts

#### when would they use each one?

* I would just usually look at the combined statement. I don't really see the need to look at individually

#### would combined statement increase/decrease trust?

### Combined statement .gov replica

#### How does it compare to what you were expecting?

* Line items for copays, what the charges are, line items for overpayments, what the charges are  
* Pretty straightforward it starts with copayments then overpayments which is what I saw on the earlier screen, copays then overpayments

#### What would make it useful?

* Not that I can think of no

#### When would you use it?

#### Overwhelm?

* Not overwhelming at all, very easy to navigate  
* Viewing individually would be a shorter page

#### Actions or decisions from viewing this?

#### Format? (email, app, PDF, etc)

* Uh, desktop, but that's just my normal habit in most cases for anything financial-related. I just like looking at bigger screens for that type of stuff.

### Combined statement PDF

#### Download combined statement: clear?

* Probably open a PDF

#### Current PDF usage on phone?

* Yes, on computer, again, on my phone, not as much. I just like to look at it on a big screen.

#### Would PDF of combined statement be useful?

* Would download PDF on desktop  
* Wouldn't really want to read on phone \- Not as easy for me to read. I prefer reading on a computer. And not to say that, like, I'm unable to do so, it's just not as convenient for me

#### How does it compare to what you were expecting?

* What he expected

#### What would make it useful?

* Um… I don't have any thoughts.

#### When would you use it?

### Individual statements: copays

#### How does this compare to combined statement?

#### When would you use this vs combined statement?

#### Is one more useful than other?

### Individual statements: overpayments

#### How does this compare to combined statement?

* I think this has a little more level of detail because you can actually resolve the overpayment here. I would prefer that in the combined statement  
* More detail than in the combined statement

#### When would you use this vs combined statement?

* If could resolve from combined statement, it would meet his needs

#### Is one more useful than other?

### Review of combined statement (some questions will be repeats from earlier)

#### What info is important regarding financial situation?

* amount due, services rendered, description of the charge, same thing that I saw in the combined statement.

#### When would you use combined statement vs individual

#### would combined statement increase/decrease trust?

* No, all the same source of information

#### when are you managing debts and bills?

* Resolve on phone? if I have some due date, and for whatever reason, I don't have access to my, like, laptop.

#### Trust
