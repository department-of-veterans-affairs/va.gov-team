## **General info**

#### Involvement with VA

* Separated 2002\. Has worked as civilian contractor and federal employee at medical centers.  
* Disability claims have been terrible and problematic. Healthcare is mostly good. I have some issues here and there scheduling appointments quick enough... community of care appointment have to wait \- can't use the regular VA website to file claim. You have to use the BTS website. Has to change the address... has had claims denied even though their community of care appointments  
* Copays haven't been an enormous amount. It's typically been a problem, reading the date of service and being like what the hell is this bill for? Mentions comparing EOB from BCBS for medication... VA says it costs more, so I gotta contact \[private health insurance\] \- VA charge more. That's not a huge complaint. My copays are only for medication. They do third-party billing to BCBS. Copay should've been like $7-$7,500 but he's only billed for medication. I've had \[number of surgeries\], so not receiving a bill for those things have been better than me complaining this is supposed to be $3 and not $15.

#### App / website experience

* For standard travel claims, go through app or website, but those are only for appoinemtns at VA facilities. Brings up separate browser to log in and fill out the claims there  
* The app for me, is just if I have to look for letters. If I'm looking for letters from the VA like exact verbiage. It's easier to find the letters on the website than it is through the app. I do 90% of my stuff through the app, the other 10% is through the website looking for letters.  
* I usually use the website when I'm at work, cell signal and data signal is hit or miss in the basement at \[redacted\]. I have my biometrics saved (logs in with facial recognition). The navigation buttons are chunked down on the bottom.... I think the vast majority of the time using the app is easier for me.

## **Interview (before screen sharing)**

#### Benefit overpayment experience

* I have never received a benefit overpayment  
* mentions friend that had one \- VA didn't remove his step children and he received a bill for over $10,000, VA ended up dropping the case because it was their fault

#### Copayment experience

* I've never had a bill come in within a few week it's always been at least a month to multiple months out. Receives letter in the mail \- it may have one it may have 8\. Highest bill I've seen is close to $200. It's frustrating that it took 3-4 months to get the bill in.  
* Bill has number to call, pay online, mail in check or money order. I've done online payment 99% of the time. I've had to do an over the phone ayment once when pay.gov was not working. They took their time sending the bill, I'm gonna wait til the day of to pay it and then it's like oh crap, pay.gov's down.  
* I don't get notified except for through the mail.

#### when are you managing debts and bills?

* I have all my recurring bills set up in Google Calendar with reminders at least the day before. So I'll go in and take a look the bill's due in a couple days and then if I have to move money around, I will. Currently getting a divorce... mentions transfering money from joint account to personal account  
* Gets notification from Gmail, then I'll go in and look to see what else is coming in or going out that week. It's a couple of times a week that I'll get a notification whether it's Netflix or cell phone or Progressive... needs to separate policies for auto insurance..  
* "All within Google Calendar, previously kept spreadsheets and whiteboard. Stopped using spreadsheets temporarily because of the issues of joint versus personal bills  
* Once the house sells and the bills get paid, then I can go back into a much more active budgeting stance and go back to using spreadsheet. Use my whiteboard ... don't buy too much on Amazon this week"

#### How they organize thoughts of debt and bills

#### How they manage payments

#### Do they look at both at same time?

## **Prototype: current experience**

### Dashboard (buttons for overpayment, copay, and combined statement)

#### overall thoughts

#### when would they use each one?

* I would actually like to view them separately. I see here combined statement. I think having them separate is better because you know exactly what is what  
* For me it would be simplicity of not having to figure out what is these bills for. Copays are typically due within 30 days to not have fees added I 've never received an overpayment so I don't know what the repayment plan would be for overpayements.

#### would combined statement increase/decrease trust?

### Combined statement .gov replica

#### How does it compare to what you were expecting?

* The copay charges are pretty similar to what I receive in paper form and when I look at it online. You know pretty standard stuff. The overpayments.... I would like to know what the balance increase is of $15 per month. Balance decrease of $100 \- is that an auto draft like an ACH transfer, was it taken out of my monthly disability payments.

#### What would make it useful?

* \[Balance increase/decrease unclear\] I would want something itemized like a bank statement to know why it was added  
* I do like that it has the buttons to review and resolve, the phone number to discuss, for the medical copays it's broken down by facility and why it's incurred. As far as the overpayment, I like that it's broken down by what was the overpayment.

#### When would you use it?

#### Overwhelm?

* 2 \- only becaue there's not enough detail to understand what the charges and debits are

#### Actions or decisions from viewing this?

#### Format? (email, app, PDF, etc)

* Mail and email to receive bills \- I'm not some super crunchy granola person but if I can reduce paper waste, I will. In addition to reducing paper waste, there's less cost to the goverment (paper and postage) ... would like the option to be notified electronically and opt out of paper billing

### Combined statement PDF

#### Download combined statement: clear?

* Thinks it's going to be a condensed version of everything on screen in a PDF

#### Current PDF usage on phone?

* Views PDFs on phone

#### Would PDF of combined statement be useful?

* Yeah, just like the previous page, it's broken down

#### How does it compare to what you were expecting?

* This is exactly what I was expecting \- very similar to what I receive

#### What would make it useful?

* Mentioned earlier, balance decrease / increase \- why?

#### When would you use it?

* Would like the PDF as a monthly statement \- almost like a bank statement and go in and search a date frame (whether it's 6 months, 2 months, or last 3 years). This almost looks like an annual statement, but I would also like it in a monthly statement.  
* Likes the PDF if it had more information, even the other format, I would like more information like the why. This format \[PDF\] is much easier to view. I can increase or decrease magnification and copy lines into a spreadsheet and do whatever math I wanted to.

### Individual statements: copays

#### How does this compare to combined statement?

* I think this is okay. I think this is alright.

#### When would you use this vs combined statement?

* I like this version having everything separated instead of tab over. I like these huge headers vs. the oval buttons to tab between

#### Is one more useful than other?

### Individual statements: overpayments

#### How does this compare to combined statement?

#### When would you use this vs combined statement?

#### Is one more useful than other?

### Review of combined statement (some questions will be repeats from earlier)

#### What info is important regarding financial situation?

#### When would you use combined statement vs individual

#### would combined statement increase/decrease trust?

* I don't think one seems more trustworthy but prefers them separate

#### when are you managing debts and bills?

## **Prototype: future experience**

### First version of combined statement

#### Which version? (A or B)

* A

#### What are your thoughts?

* I do not like that you have to drill down into each clinic or location because if someone were to miss that, they don't know what's going on.  
* This is okay having two separate.. I would like it not having to drill down to view what's what, you know you don't want to necesarily miss anything. ...it's not information overload on a single screen  
* \[Viewing PDF\] To me, it looks more like an annual statement \- I think it's too much unless someone is actively looking for it so I would just like a month statement

#### Would you use this?

#### When might you use this?

#### Trust

### Second version of combined statement

#### Which version? (A or B)

* B

#### What are your thoughts?

* I don't know if that was me, but I like that they come pre-expanded.

#### Compare to other version

* I think that's fine \[explanation\] especially if you're not greater than 50%

#### Which do you prefer?

* A

### Overall thoughts on combined statement

#### What changes would you make?

* \[while viewing Veteran information accordion expanded\] Button for address change

### Individual statement

#### Which one are they viewing? (overpay or copay)

* Copay

#### When might you use this vs combined statement?

* Mentions it being redundant

### Wrap-up

#### Where would you expect to find combined statement?

#### Other thoughts on combined statement?

* Would like to see a breakout of everything on combined statement \- would like to see on one page vs the separation of copays/overpays  
* Potentially having the ability to look at the entire year, current month, previous  
* Would like them separate but the PDF would be useful

#### Would you use this on the app?

* Yes, I would

#### Other thoughts on managing finances?

* Maybe just have a link to pay.gov on... you know everywhere... whenever resolve copay goes to, have the link to pay.gov
