# **P05**

## **General info**

#### Involvement with VA

* Separated 1998  
* Since medical separation, got into VA health care system since 2000-2002, has been in VA healthcare system since

#### App / website experience

* Primary use has been BTS3 \- travel (sitting in truck taking call) uses nearly daily  
* Mainly uses website (medical records, Rx refills) until recently. Started using app recently because there's been lots of changes. Uses it to access medical records, secure messages, prescriptions, as opposed to web. Was a user of MHV until they got it  
* "Has the app on phone so it's convenient to automatically log on as opposed to going to website and having to go through security stuff (app uses facial recognition)   
*  Heard of My HeatheVet going away.  
*  Part of Disabled American Vets."

## **Interview (before screen sharing)**

#### Benefit overpayment experience

* Run into issues with particularly travel overpayments which are errors on the VA part, had to go through process of getting fixed. Mentioned civilian ER visit as well that VA wanted to recoup from me (ER billed VA)  
* BTS-3 within the last year \- all claims processed offsite someplace \- a little bit of a change. It's faster but still not without its problems  
* "Learned of overpayments from letters from VA \- not the most clear on how to deal with the debt management office  
*   Typically get letter from local VA folks then get more detailed letter from debt management  
*   Similar for travel situation as well \- not the best way to address it with debt management – issues are being looked into but on hold (contacting debt management directly)"

#### Copayment experience

* Not paying copays

#### when are you managing debts and bills?

* Typically at home, usually around the end/beginning of the month but can happen throughout the month (depending on timing of bills) working on them all the time but focusing on main bills at the beginning/end  
* "Nothing, just knows bills are due and that I need to take care of them.   
*  No particular method of keeping track – email notices from credit cards, drop into a folder on my phone   
*  Gets app notification or emails that triggers me to take care of it"

#### How they organize thoughts of debt and bills

#### How they manage payments

* 75% of bills come all at once (beginning/end of month) a couple come in the middle of the month and get to them whenever I have time to work on them  
* Gets plenty of heads up to make sure I'm not late (email/notification) \- doesn't know of any bills that don't give me a warning

#### Do they look at both at same time?

* I don't know how to answer that one.

## **Prototype: current experience**

### Dashboard (buttons for overpayment, copay, and combined statement)

#### overall thoughts

#### when would they use each one?

* Doesn't matter

#### would combined statement increase/decrease trust?

### Combined statement .gov replica

#### How does it compare to what you were expecting?

* Probably similar to a typical creditors bill where it has a statement where it has the date, nature of charge, and being able to pay it  
* Seems to make sense, it's giving me the information I'm looking for to make a payment – spot on

#### What would make it useful?

* Doesn't pay copays – It's giving me a detail of what the individual payments, they're saying hey you owe $75  
* Wouldn't mind if I click on billing reference, see more details about the actual event  
* Some place to view original document where they could see where the $1395 came from (like a regular bill where it goes into more detail on whre they came up with the number)

#### When would you use it?

#### Overwhelm?

* 2 or 3 – Getting a bit overwhelming but depends on how much debt you have

#### Actions or decisions from viewing this?

#### Format? (email, app, PDF, etc)

* PDF, phone or tablet

#### Transaction history

* A year's not bad, possibly, a little more recognizable from civilian billing  
* Each block could be a one liner thing \- (reduce scrolling) could zoom in or out, mentions expanding rows

### Combined statement PDF

#### Download combined statement: clear?

* Expects all this information to be in one document

#### Current PDF usage on phone?

* Typically has to save to phone because it doesn't give me the option to zoom in  
* Thinks he would still have to save the PDF to pinch and zoom in \- saves in upper part of screen to phone and uses Adobe to view

#### Would PDF of combined statement be useful?

* Yes, I like how this is formatted. A little easier to look at (more scrolling on statement screen)

#### How does it compare to what you were expecting?

* What he was thinking

#### Statement page vs PDF?

* Likes the statement page, but would like to be able to save the document to iPad  
* Has printed PDFs from phone

#### What would make it useful?

#### When would you use it?

### Individual statements: copays

#### How does this compare to combined statement?

#### When would you use this vs combined statement?

#### Is one more useful than other?

## **Prototype: future experience**

### First version of combined statement

#### Which version? (A or B)

* A

#### What are your thoughts?

* I like this very much (whiile on overpayment detail)  
* Not as cluttered or as much information thrown at me and I have the ability to switch between the two  
* Prefers copays/overpayments separated out

#### Would you use this?	

#### When might you use this?

#### Trust

* You're asking if I trust the VA, No I'm just joking.... it's giving me the ability to go back and see what actually happened, able to see transactions and maybe if you had questions you can address them off the app

### Second version of combined statement

#### Which version? (A or B)

* B

#### What are your thoughts?

* Can understand pharmacy stuff, but the possibility to link to medical records \- figure out what I was doing at the hospital that day especially if I have a lot of medical appointments \- link to medical records and provider note for that day, I would be able to get my ducks in a row and say why are you charging me for this

#### Compare to other version

* My brain can't tell the difference

#### Which do you prefer?

* B \- probably because I don't fall underneath that category where I have copays, it might be helpful for somebody else

### Overall thoughts on combined statement

#### What changes would you make?

### Individual statement

#### Which one are they viewing? (overpay or copay)

* Copay bills

#### When might you use this vs combined statement?

* This works, I like this as well. One to take care of it rather than have debt management giving me the option to take care of it right from home  
* Doesn't mind either version (A or B) Putting disability hat on, there are quite a few veterans that may not be technologically inclined that any of these current/future versions is going to give them grief. Trying to make it as simple to work through as possible as well especially if they're not technologically inclined. My dad he would probably throw his phone across the room  
* Likes the versions with the two tabs, if VA was to choose one or the other, I wouldn't have a problem working with either one.

### Wrap-up

#### Where would you expect to find combined statement?

* Within review details, I don't know if transaction history would do that

#### Other thoughts on combined statement?

* Useful yes, maybe not necessary, it can be separated if I had a separate overpay and copay view

#### Other thoughts on managing finances?
