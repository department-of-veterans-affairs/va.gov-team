## **General info**

#### Involvement with VA

* separated in 1978  
* It's been about 10 years now that I have been in the VA system medically wise. That's my only form of medical. I don't have any outside insurance. I'm in constant contact with the VA.

#### App / website experience

* All the time \- I'm not necessarily using the mobile app, I use My HealtheVet, but I use apps all the time. MHV is website  
* \[MHV\] Mostly communicating with providers as far as appointments, doctor visits. I don't have a desktop, I have a laptop, but I don't use the laptop unless it's absolutely necessary. It's always my phone. It seems to be just more convenient and always in my hand.

## **Interview (before screen sharing)**

#### Benefit overpayment experience

* Never had a situation I had to pay any money back. It's just been billing for healthcare

#### Copayment experience

* Not currently receiving copays, but has in the past. Most recently filed a hardship claim 4 or 5 months ago.  
* "Learned of bills in the mail  
*  Always knew bills were coming  
*  \[Clear?\] Yes  
*  When I was paying the copays, I just did it through my banking and a bill pay so that's how I take care of that."  
* Hardship?\] I've known it was an option. I've used it in the past when I was in \[location\], but I did that actually on-site at the \[redacted\] VA.  
* Statements received through USPS.

#### when are you managing debts and bills?

* I am retired. I only work part-time at will and I get social security, so my banking is set up to coincide with my SS checks so I do all my banking online.  
* "Mostly, I get statements in the mail, but I'm set up on recurring basis in my mobile banking.  
*  (automatically taken care of)"  
* "I'm always making sure I'm not late on anything, and if it looks like something is due before I get my SS check, I might may directly in an app, like a credit card app.  
*  Prompt: Email notifications  
*  Sometime of them come in direct mail. I'm trying to think which ones come in direct mail. My credit card statements, I prefer to have in  
*  direct mail, so that I have a hard copy to look at."

#### Challenging/confusing?

* No

#### How they organize thoughts of debt and bills

* I pretty much look at everything around the time of the month that I get my SS and make sure I'm on top of it, so I try to keep it all at one time.

#### How they manage payments

* Managing at home on sofa  
* \[Preferred methods for paying?\]: It's set up in my bill pay

#### Do they look at both at same time?

## **Prototype: current experience**

### Dashboard (buttons for overpayment, copay, and combined statement)

#### overall thoughts

#### when would they use each one?

* "Well there's buttons for each one, I can look at each one of them individually.  
*  or a combined statement"  
* I think I would just want to look at the copay bills

#### would combined statement increase/decrease trust?

### Combined statement .gov replica

#### How does it compare to what you were expecting?

* It looks like everything's pretty well laid out as far as previous balance, what it's for, dates, amounts, references, it looks like everything's here that I would need.

#### What would make it useful?

* I can't think of anything. It looks like everything's here.

#### Compare to individual

* I don't know that I would use one over the other, but this is obviously much more comprehensive, and it has everything laid out.

#### When would you use it?

#### Overwhelm?

* 0

#### Actions or decisions from viewing this?

* Just what needs my immediate attention  
* "\[Vs individuals?\] No, I mean, I would obviously take care of the one that required attention.  
*  most immediately."

#### Format? (email, app, PDF, etc)

* I mean yeah, I always prefer to print things out so I have a physical record of what I've paid and I usually pin and make a notation of what made when

### Combined statement PDF

#### Download combined statement: clear?

* "That would be for my record keeping  
*  That's exactly what I would expect. I would use it to print"

#### Current PDF usage on phone?

* Most likely no, I would print it. I just like to have my hands on a physical piece of paper so that I can look at it. Sometimes when I try to expand it on my phone, it expands too. much. So it's just easier for me to read if I have a physical copy.

## **Prototype: future experience**

### First version of combined statement

#### Which version? (A or B)

* A

#### What are your thoughts?

* It has today's date. It has total due: $75. I would see when that's due, and I'm not seeing that at the top. It's telling me the date, but it's not telling me when it's due.  
* If there were questions, I would call the number  
* Apparently that button is not working. Again, I would just need to see some dates.  
* "Well, I mean, I can print out whatever I need to print out, but it looks like…  
*  There was one that was comprehensive, and that's the one that I would want to look at. \[PDF\]"  
* "the way I comprehend things, it's just easier for me.  
*  To keep it in my mind, and keep it straight. If I have it on a piece of paper, as opposed to looking at this and scrolling through it."  
* Prefers hard copy

#### Would you use this?

* Use on phone to get a brief snapshot. I guess just an overview of what is being tallied and how it's broken down.  
* "No. I keep saying I prefer to see it in a hard copy, so my preference would be to print it out and look at it in a hard copy.  
*  I don't have enough on my phone, and I typically don't use my computer. I prefer a hard copy in all instances."

#### Notifications?

* "I get notifications about upcoming appointments, text message and email. Um, they're useful. I'm checking for an appointment, I can check in.  
*  on my phone, and they're reminders constantly"  
* \[No additional reminders\] I mean, I feel like I get too many as it is, so…
