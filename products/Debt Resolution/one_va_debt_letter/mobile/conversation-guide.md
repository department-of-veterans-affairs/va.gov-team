# ‚úÖ ‚úÖ ‚úÖ Intro

Thank you so much for joining today. My name is Emily, and [NAME] here will be taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the digital waiting room who would like to observe, but we‚Äôll get to that momentarily.

Today, we‚Äôll be discussing how people think about and manage certain financial items. We'll be going over debt from VA benefit overpayments and VA medical copays. I'd like to check in first ‚Äì are you comfortable dicussing these topics?

I'm part of the team working on the VA mobile app and VA.gov, helping to create great experiences for Veterans managing their benefits, finances, and healthcare.
What I hope to do today is to get a sense of how you want to manage your VA finances, and how our tools can support that.
I want you to know up front that I won't be able to solve issues for you right now ‚Äì I don't have any access to your records, nor any direct contact with billing and debt departments.
I do want to know about your frustrations in case there are things we can improve in the future.


Before we start, I have a few logistics to cover:



* I have [number] colleagues who are interested in observing this session to better understand the Veteran experience. Would you be okay with them observing?
    * _If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom._
    * _If yes: Admit observers._
* _(after all observers have entered)_ I'm going to have all our observers turn on cameras if you're able and do a very brief intro so that you know who all is here. _(call on everyone individually - have them say first name and position at VA)_
* _(after intros are done)_ Thanks all! You can go ahead and mute yourselves and turn off your cameras.
<br></br>
* This will take about 60 minutes. Because I want to keep us on time, I may occasionally prompt you to the next topic.
* We want your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers, and we‚Äôre not testing anything of you. I will not be offended by any opinions you share.
* Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
* I‚Äôll be having you work with a prototype for part of today. It may look and act like the real app and website, but it‚Äôs only a demo tool and therefore lots of elements will not be working. You will not be logged into your account, so nothing you do will affect your benefits or anything else in your account.
* Were you able to download the mobile app Figma?
    * _(if Yes)_: Great, thank you. I‚Äôll be walking you through signing in with a test account later, and this is how you‚Äôll view the prototype.
    * _(if No)_ : no problem. Do you recall specific issues you were having? _(don‚Äôt spend too much time troubleshooting)_
    * _(if they don‚Äôt have Figma - note that they‚Äôll be viewing the responsive prototype)_
<br></br>
* If you would be okay with it, we would like to record this session today, but let me explain things first before you consent. 
    * The purpose is to assure that we capture your opinions accurately. Your name and other identifying information will never be used when reporting on this project ‚Äì for example we assign you a participant ID (such as P7) if quoting you. And after we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed.
    * Knowing this, are you comfortable with me recording the session?
    * And also, it can sometimes be helpful to share video clips from sessions to our VA partners so they can better understand the experiences of Veterans. In these clips, we blur out anything that could identify you ‚Äì your profile photo for example ‚Äì and they would only be shared among VA partners. I will also ask at the end of this session so that you could veto, but knowing this, would you be comfortable with us potentially using a clip from this session?
    * _(if yes)_ I‚Äôm going to start the recording, and once I do I‚Äôm going to confirm once more that you‚Äôre okay with the recording.
<br></br>

‚è∫Ô∏è Start recording.
<br></br>
> [!TIP]
> After you start the recording, click the Show captions (CC) button to enable transcription for the recording.

* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
* Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?



# ‚úÖ ‚úÖ ‚úÖ Warm-up Questions

Could you tell me a bit about yourself as a Veteran if you're comfortable: what branch of the military did you serve, and when did you retire or separate?

How have you been involved with VA ‚Äì both in the past and now?

* Have you been in any of their facilities?
* Have you used the website and/or app? For what purpose(s)?

Now we're going to move to the financial portion of our discussion. I want to make sure that you‚Äôre only sharing what you‚Äôre willing ‚Äì I have no additional information about you or your finances with the VA.

# üöß üöß üöß Interview Section

At whatever level you're comfortable, can you tell me about your current or recent experience with owing VA money for benefit overpayments?

* How did you first learn of this debt?
* Did you know that this debt was coming?
* Did you understand what it was for?
* Did you understand your options?
* What sort of communication regarding this debt have you received?

And again at the level you're comfortable, what is your experience with receiving bills from VA healthcare copayments?

* How do you learn about any copay bills?
* Do you always know that they are coming?
* Is it clear to you what they are for?
* Is it clear to you what your options are once you receive a bill?
* What sort of communication do you receive regarding these bills?

Now I'd like to ask you about times that you're actively managing these debts and bills. When I say manage that could be such things as reading info about debt or charges, determining next steps, requesting help, or making payments.
* When you're looking to do any sort of management of your VA finances, when are you typically doing that? This could be time of day or night, as it relates to other activities, or maybe at some physical location.
    * Can you tell me why you choose to do this at these times/days/locations?
* Are there things that prompt you to take action on any of these debts or bills?

Thinking about both the overpayment and the copays together, talk to me about how you think of them both overall within your greater financial realm.
* Are you making payments at the same or similar time for both?
* What is your method for making sure you make these payments in a timely fashion?
* How are you currently managing any debts and bills that you have? Are you keeping track of anything from both?
    * Is there anything that is challenging or confusing in keeping track of both?
* Are you ever looking at information and history for both of these at once?
    * If yes: how are you doing that? What elements are important to you?
    * If no: is that something that might be useful at all to you? In what capacity?

# üöß üöß üöß Screen sharing: current experience of combined statements

We‚Äôre now going to move into looking at prototypes. First, I‚Äôd like you to share your screen please ‚Äì have you done this before on your phone?



* _(send link to prototype)_

In this example, we‚Äôre going to pretend that you have overpayment debt from some education benefits, along with medical copayments from regular doctor visits and prescriptions.

(Debt and bill overview)

Before tapping on anything: looking at this page, what stands out to you as being important and useful to how you want to manage your debt and bills?



* When might you look at just your copays?
* When might you look at just your overpayments?
* When might you look at your combined statement?
    * Before you tap into that, what do you expect to find in the combined statement?
* Would having a combined statement increase or decrease your trust in the information presented compared to individual letters?

(Combined statement)

Now tap into that combined statement please



* How does this compare to what you were expecting?
* What information would you want here to make this a useful tool?
* In what situations would you use this combined statement?
* What actions or decisions would you want to make when viewing this? Is it any different than viewing individual statements?
* How would you prefer to interact with this information? (e.g. email, mobile app, desktop, PDF)

(combined statement PDF)

Don‚Äôt yet tap, but looking at the PDF button: tell me any thoughts regarding PDFs on your phone. 



* Do you look at PDFs on your phone now?
    * If so: what are you doing with them?
    * If not: why not?
* Would having access to a PDF of this combined statement be useful to you?
    * Why or why not?
    * What would you do with it?

Now please tap on the PDF



* How does this compare to what you were expecting?
* What information would you want here to make this a useful tool?
* How does this PDF compare to the combined statement we looked at right before this?
    * In what situations might you use one or the other?

(individual: overpayments)

I‚Äôd like you to look at the individual information for the benefit overpayments



* Considering what you just viewed in the combined statement, how does it compare to what you‚Äôre viewing here?
* In what situations might you look at this compared to the combined statement?
* Is one more useful than the other?

(individual: copays)

Now I‚Äôd like you to look at the individual information for the medical copayments



* Considering what you just viewed in the combined statement, how does it compare to what you‚Äôre viewing here?
* In what situations might you look at this compared to the combined statement?
* Is one more useful than the other?

(review)

Now that you‚Äôve looked at the combined statement, and each individual sections of overpayments and copays:



* What information is important to you when considering your full financial situation?
* Any further thoughts on when you might look through the combined statement compared to the individual overpayments or copays sections?
* I‚Äôll repeat a question from earlier: Would having a combined statement increase or decrease your trust in the information presented compared to individual letters?
* And another question I‚Äôll bring back: any further thoughts on when you would be looking to manage your finances ‚Äì time or day, your physical location, a situation, etc.


# üöß üöß üöß Screen sharing: future experience of combined statements

(app prototype)

Now we‚Äôll look at some new designs for the mobile app that currently do not exist anywhere. We'll start with the combined statement.



* What are your first impressions?
* How clear and understandable is everything here?
* Are there details missing that would be important to you?
* How likely are you to use this in the app?
* Is there anything that would make you trust this more?

I‚Äôll have you look at the individual sections now ‚Äì please head to the [either: overpayments/copays] in the designs



* Comparing this to the combined statement we just looked at in our pretend app, when might you view one over the other?

Where would you expect to locate the combined statement within the app?
