	# Research Plan for Mobile Feature Support, One VA Debt Letter in mobile app, September 2025

## Background üèóÔ∏è
<details><summary>Briefly describe the background of your product.</summary>
	
`What problem is your product trying to solve?`

**Veterans who have overpayment debts and copayment bills do not have a single place to view all outstanding debts from the VA on the VAHB mobile app. How might we validate that Veterans want a standard format or structure that unifies their debt information on the mobile app, and provides them with a positive user experience?**
  
`Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)`

**The combined statement is available on VA.gov, authenticated. It is not currently available in the mobile app**
  
`What is Veterans‚Äô familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?`

**It is a relatively new product: the combined statement was introduced to VA.gov in April 2025. If we built it in the app, it will be similar to that experience.**

### [OCTO-DE Priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202025.md) 

<details><summary>Which OCTO priorities does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed. </summary>


`Objective 1:  VA‚Äôs digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.`  

> - **Key Result 1:** Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.
> - **Key Result 2:** We have reduced the total time Veterans spend waiting for a response from our digital experiences by 50%, towards a goal of less than 4 seconds per transaction.
> - **Key Result 3:** 100% of transactions received via our digital experiences are either processed correctly or we have notified the user of an error.

### [Veteran Journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)

<details><summary>Where does your product fit into the Veteran journey?
Are there moments that matter?</summary>

`Because the product involves both debt and healthcare, it touches several key points in the Veteran‚Äôs overall journey with VA services.`

- `Starting Up (Moment: Balancing Finances)`
- `Taking Care of Myself (Moment: Maintaining my health)`
- `Putting Down Roots (Moment: Maintaining my financial, social, and emotional health)`
- `Retiring (Moment: Taking care of my health)`
- `Aging (Moment that Matters: Managing my declining health)`

## Research Goals ü•Ö	

### Goals and Questions

**Goal 1: Assess veteran interest, value, and trust in a combined VA debt statement on mobile.**

`1.` How do Veterans currently manage or track multiple debts from the VA?

`2.` What challenges or pain points do Veterans face without a centralized debt view?

`3.` Do Veterans see value in a single place to view all outstanding financial obligations on mobile?

`4.` Does having a combined statement increase or decrease Veterans‚Äô trust in the information presented compared to individual letters?

`5.` Does the combined statement make it easier or harder for Veterans to understand their total financial situation?

**Goal 2: Identify Veteran needs, expectations, and preferences for viewing and interacting with a combined statement of outstanding debts on mobile.**

`6.` In what situations would they use a combined statement?

`7.` What actions or decisions would they want to take when viewing a combined statement, and is that different from viewing only individual statements?

`8.` What information or features would make a combined statement most useful?

`9.` How would Veterans prefer to interact with this document? (e.g. PDF, email, mobile app, web)

`10.` Is having a downloadable PDF of the combined statement important when using a phone?

`11.` How do the use cases differ between individual copay statements and debt letters vs combined statements?

`12.` Is there additional information Veterans wish were included in a combined statement?

  
### Outcome

- **Provide a Go or No-Go decision:** determine if Veterans see sufficient value in a combined statement in the mobile app, saving significant developer effort if it is not desired.

- **Define feature set for MVP:** determine which functions will be essential for launch.

- **Establish information architecture and content:** inform the design, labeling, and content hierarchy, ensuring that the combined statement is clear and reliable.

- **Determine UX flow and digital strategy:** seeing how Veterans prefer to interact with a combined statement will guide the user flow in the app.

### Hypotheses

- Veterans currently find it challenging to see the overall financial pictures of their debt and bills.
- They will like the idea of a combined statement to have the current financial obligations of overpayments and copays in one place.
- Veterans will trust that the information provided is accurate and up to date.
- The current structure of a combined statement will be overwhelming to most.
- They will want to view details of the debts and bills from combined statements.
- Veterans will find PDFs of combined statements valuable, both as a familiar format and as a way to save for reference.
- They will still want access to individual statements and bills, and the combined statement will not be a substitute for these.
  
## Methodology  üõ†Ô∏è

**Moderated remote sessions: semi-structured interviews and concept testing**

We will use semi-structured interviews and concept testing in this phase of discovery research. The purpose of the interviews is to understand whether or not Veterans would find use in having a combined statement within the mobile app. Concept testing will be conducted by presenting participants with an early-stage design concept for how a combined statement could be displayed, in order to gather feedback on possible user flows and features.

The interview component will consist of conversation only, without any visual aids such as prototypes or screenshots of existing experiences.

For the concept testing portion, Veterans will interact with two prototypes:

* The first prototype will simulate the current experience: accessing the combined statement currently available on the website, plus viewing details for overpayment debts and copayment bills individually.
* The second prototype will illustrate a potential new design for the mobile app, showing how Veterans could view both debts and bills together.

## üöß üöß üöß Recruitment üéØ	
*OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers.*

> [!NOTE]
> Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources: 
> - [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recruiting-participants) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
> - [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach
*Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them?* 
- Perigean **CANNOT** recruit VA employees or VSOs. Work with your VA lead to recruit these groups. 
- Perigean can also support remote, [unmoderated studies](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/perigean-recruiting-process-for-unmoderated-studie), however, these studies require strict recruitment requirements. 
- Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

### Recruitment criteria

- **Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants.**
- Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

- The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria.
- Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria.
- Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Review an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/pre-mhv-prototype/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md)

### List the ideal completed sessions and total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study:

- `Date and time of pilot session:` **[Enter time]** 

### Research sessions
- `Planned dates of research:` **[Enter dates MM/DD-MM/DD]**

### Length of sessions
- `Session length: (e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)` **[Enter time length]**
  
- `Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time)` **[Enter buffer time]**
  
- `Maximum Sessions per day: (We all have limits - how many sessions can you and your team conduct in one day considering the session length, the mental strain of conducting sessions, other work you still need to complete in a day, etc?)` **[Enter NUM per day]**

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. 

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S. 

> [!TIP]
> Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. **(e.g. 3/17, Monday 9:00AM-1:00PM, 3:00PM-6:00PM EST; 3/18, Tuesday 9:00AM-6:00PM EST, etc.;** ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
