	# Research Plan for Mobile Feature Support, One VA Debt Letter in mobile app, September 2025

## Background üèóÔ∏è
<details><summary>Briefly describe the background of your product.</summary>
	
`What problem is your product trying to solve?`

**Veterans who have overpayment debts and copayment bills do not have a single place to view all outstanding debts from the VA on the VAHB mobile app. How might we validate that Veterans want a standard format or structure that unifies their debt information on the mobile app, and provides them with a positive user experience?**
  
`Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)`

**The combined statement is available on VA.gov, authenticated. It is not currently available in the mobile app**
  
`What is Veterans‚Äô familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?`

**It is a relatively new product: the combined statement was introduced to VA.gov in April 2025. If we built it in the app, it will be similar to that experience.**

### [OCTO-DE Priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202025.md) 

<details><summary>Which OCTO priorities does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed. </summary>


`Objective 1:  VA‚Äôs digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.`  

> - **Key Result 1:** Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.
> - **Key Result 2:** We have reduced the total time Veterans spend waiting for a response from our digital experiences by 50%, towards a goal of less than 4 seconds per transaction.
> - **Key Result 3:** 100% of transactions received via our digital experiences are either processed correctly or we have notified the user of an error.

### [Veteran Journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)

<details><summary>Where does your product fit into the Veteran journey?
Are there moments that matter?</summary>

`Because the product involves both debt and healthcare, it touches several key points in the Veteran‚Äôs overall journey with VA services.`

- `Starting Up (Moment: Balancing Finances)`
- `Taking Care of Myself (Moment: Maintaining my health)`
- `Putting Down Roots (Moment: Maintaining my financial, social, and emotional health)`
- `Retiring (Moment: Taking care of my health)`
- `Aging (Moment that Matters: Managing my declining health)`

## Research Goals ü•Ö	

### Goals and Questions

**Goal 1: Assess veteran interest, value, and trust in a combined VA debt statement on mobile.**

`1.` How do Veterans currently manage or track multiple debts from the VA?

`2.` What challenges or pain points do Veterans face without a centralized debt view?

`3.` Do Veterans see value in a single place to view all outstanding financial obligations on mobile?

`4.` Does having a combined statement increase or decrease Veterans‚Äô trust in the information presented compared to individual letters?

`5.` Does the combined statement make it easier or harder for Veterans to understand their total financial situation?

**Goal 2: Identify Veteran needs, expectations, and preferences for viewing and interacting with a combined statement of outstanding debts on mobile.**

`6.` In what situations would they use a combined statement?

`7.` What actions or decisions would they want to take when viewing a combined statement, and is that different from viewing only individual statements?

`8.` What information or features would make a combined statement most useful?

`9.` How would Veterans prefer to interact with this document? (e.g. PDF, email, mobile app, web)

`10.` Is having a downloadable PDF of the combined statement important when using a phone?

`11.` How do the use cases differ between individual copay statements and debt letters vs combined statements?

`12.` Is there additional information Veterans wish were included in a combined statement?

  
### Outcome

- **Provide a Go or No-Go decision:** determine if Veterans see sufficient value in a combined statement in the mobile app, saving significant developer effort if it is not desired.

- **Define feature set for MVP:** determine which functions will be essential for launch.

- **Establish information architecture and content:** inform the design, labeling, and content hierarchy, ensuring that the combined statement is clear and reliable.

- **Determine UX flow and digital strategy:** seeing how Veterans prefer to interact with a combined statement will guide the user flow in the app.

### Hypotheses

- Veterans currently find it challenging to see the overall financial pictures of their debt and bills.
- They will like the idea of a combined statement to have the current financial obligations of overpayments and copays in one place.
- Veterans will trust that the information provided is accurate and up to date.
- The current structure of a combined statement will be overwhelming to most.
- They will want to view details of the debts and bills from combined statements.
- Veterans will find PDFs of combined statements valuable, both as a familiar format and as a way to save for reference.
- They will still want access to individual statements and bills, and the combined statement will not be a substitute for these.
  
## Methodology  üõ†Ô∏è

**Moderated remote sessions: semi-structured interviews and concept testing**

We will use semi-structured interviews and concept testing in this phase of discovery research. The purpose of the interviews is to understand whether or not Veterans would find use in having a combined statement within the mobile app. Concept testing will be conducted by presenting participants with an early-stage design concept for how a combined statement could be displayed, in order to gather feedback on possible user flows and features.

The interview component will consist of conversation only, without any visual aids such as prototypes or screenshots of existing experiences.

For the concept testing portion, Veterans will interact with two prototypes:

* The first prototype will simulate the current experience: accessing the combined statement currently available on the website, plus viewing details for overpayment debts and copayment bills individually.
* The second prototype will illustrate a potential new design for the mobile app, showing how Veterans could view both debts and bills together.

## Recruitment üéØ	


### Recruitment approach

We would like Perigean to recruit Veterans, non-AT (assistive technology) users, for Zoom sessions on smartphones.
- Veterans who have experience with both VA medical copays and benefit overpayment debt.

We would like our participants to download the Figma app prior to the sessions. They should not create an account within the app, only have it downloaded. It is available at the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
