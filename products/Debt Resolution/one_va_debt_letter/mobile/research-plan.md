## Research Goals 🥅	

### Goals and Questions

**Goal 1: Assess veteran interest, value, and trust in a combined VA debt statement on mobile.**

`1.` How do Veterans currently manage or track multiple debts from the VA?

`2.` What challenges or pain points do Veterans face without a centralized debt view?

`3.` Do Veterans see value in a single place to view all outstanding financial obligations on mobile?

`4.` Does having a combined statement increase or decrease Veterans’ trust in the information presented compared to individual letters?

`5.` Does the combined statement make it easier or harder for Veterans to understand their total financial situation?

**Goal 2: Identify Veteran needs, expectations, and preferences for viewing and interacting with a combined statement of outstanding debts on mobile.**

`6.` In what situations would they use a combined statement?

`7.` What actions or decisions would they want to take when viewing a combined statement, and is that different from viewing only individual statements?

`8.` What information or features would make a combined statement most useful?

`9.` How would Veterans prefer to interact with this document? (e.g. PDF, email, mobile app, web)

`10.` Is having a downloadable PDF of the combined statement important when using a phone?

`11.` Do Veterans still want access to individual copay statements and debt letters, or would a combined statement fully meet their needs?

`12.` Is there additional information Veterans wish were included in a combined statement?

  
### Outcome

- **Provide a Go or No-Go decision:** determine if Veterans see sufficient value in a combined statement, saving significant developer effort if it is not desired.

- **Define feature set for MVP:** determine which functions will be essential for launch.

- **Establish information architecture and content:** inform the design, labeling, and content hierarchy, ensuring that the combined statement is clear and reliable.

- **Determine UX flow and digital strategy:** seeing how Veterans prefer to interact with a combined statement will guide the user flow in the app.

### Hypotheses

- Veterans currently find it challenging to see the overall financial pictures of their debt and bills.
- They will like the idea of a combined statement to have all current financial obligations in one place.
- Veterans will trust that the information provided is accurate and up to date.
- The current structure of a combined statement will be overwhelming to most.
- They will want to view details of the debts and bills from combined statements.
- Veterans will find PDFs of combined statements valuable, both as a familiar format and as a way to save for reference.
- They will still want access to individual statements and bills, and the combined statement will not be a substitute for these.

## 🚧 🚧 🚧 Recruitment 🎯	
*OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers.*

> [!NOTE]
> Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources: 
> - [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recruiting-participants) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
> - [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach
*Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them?* 
- Perigean **CANNOT** recruit VA employees or VSOs. Work with your VA lead to recruit these groups. 
- Perigean can also support remote, [unmoderated studies](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/perigean-recruiting-process-for-unmoderated-studie), however, these studies require strict recruitment requirements. 
- Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

### Recruitment criteria

- **Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants.**
- Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

- The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria.
- Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria.
- Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Review an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/pre-mhv-prototype/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md)

### List the ideal completed sessions and total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study:
> [!NOTE]
> Your total number should equal **1.5x** your ideal completed sessions number *(e.g. for 10 ideal completed sessions, request 15 total participants)*


- `Veterans:` **[n]**
- `Caregivers:` **[n]**
- `Dependents:` **[n]**
- `Total:` **[n]**
- `Ideal completed sessions:` **[n]**

## 🚧 🚧 🚧 Timeline 🗓️
> [!NOTE]
> **Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.** 

### Optional Kick-off Call with Perigean

- `Suggested dates and times:` **[Enter dates and times MM/DD HH:MM]**

### Prepare
*When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).*

**A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session.** 
> [!NOTE]
> **Send pilot participant email in study Slack channel**

- `Pilot participant name:` **[Enter name]**
- `Date and time of pilot session:` **[Enter time]** 

### Research sessions
- `Planned dates of research:` **[Enter dates MM/DD-MM/DD]**

### Length of sessions
- `Session length: (e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)` **[Enter time length]**
  
- `Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time)` **[Enter buffer time]**
  
- `Maximum Sessions per day: (We all have limits - how many sessions can you and your team conduct in one day considering the session length, the mental strain of conducting sessions, other work you still need to complete in a day, etc?)` **[Enter NUM per day]**

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. 

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S. 

> [!TIP]
> Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. **(e.g. 3/17, Monday 9:00AM-1:00PM, 3:00PM-6:00PM EST; 3/18, Tuesday 9:00AM-6:00PM EST, etc.;** ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
