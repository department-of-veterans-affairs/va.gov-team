### FAQ's

Given VHA Payment History progress and implementation phases, the UX team has questions for PO and SMEs/stakeholders. 

This document is a backlog of ongoing questions and answers.             

## Questions
Notes, action items, and questions: [Row A of VHA SME Feedback Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Rh40UdNdiYq_9iHIa-ICROWbl873fv6WBaNXICA0YqU/edit?usp=sharing) (request access)

**1. - "When will live balances be implemented?" P3
2 - "What if the Veteran is having issues with VODA itself? Who does the Veteran make contact with?" P3 _Blue feedback button?_ 
3- "will the Veteran see payments made recently and the statements does not show balance of with a current date" P6
4- "If there is more than 1 Account number, will the charges be separated?" P8 _Yes_
5- "Is it possible an individual would still have a statement that has a balance and is older than 6 months?" P9 

6 [ ] _Unpaid balances would move to the next month until sent to Treasury (need to confirm this). Would warning about Treasury be deleted after 6 months?_

**Questions for Lighthouse from VODA:**
- [ ] What date will we be showing for medical visits (inpatient/outpatient)? Date of visit? Date processed/billed?
- [ ] Medication: What date will we be showing? Fill date?
- [ ] Does the data include clinics such as "Optometry" and "Podiatry" for both medication and medical visits? Will the clinics be names of specialties or locations? ("include the specific clinic related to the copay" P1)

**Questions from VODA to SME/Stakeholders:**
- [ ] What determines how VA medical center bills are split up? Are all VA Medical Centers within Tampa billed on the same statement? Is this true for all cities/towns? 
- [ ] Can a description be provided for this section? 
   - ("Under the 'Need Help' section at the bottom, it is essential to delineate the distinct roles of 'Ask VA' and the 'VA Health Resource Center,' as these are two fundamentally different resources that serve different purposes for Veterans." P4)
- [ ] Clarification needed on this. It is our understanding that Veterans receive monthly statements.  
   - (Past Statement page: "This may create confusion as this is not how the Veterans receive the statements via the mail. This may also become confusing for Veterans who have visits later in the month as their payments may not post until the next month. It may be more beneficial to have an overall statement view that allows Veterans to view a comprehensive overview of the year, or other determined timeframe." P4)
- [ ] Are we able to view "VPS portal displays statements to our agency"? How does this differ from the mailed statement that Veterans receive? 
   - ("Billing statements should appear the same way the physical billing statements appear when the Veterans receive them in the mail. The way the VPS portal displays statements to our agency users should be the preferred method for Veterans to view their statements to avoid confusion. "August 1" should have a year associated with the month as well." P4)
- [ ] Can we see an example of a VistA statement?
   - ("VistA has a patent level selection for a detailed or summary view of medication information. The RX name, supply, and provider name will not show on the statement if summary view is selected for a patient." P7)

- [ ] To schedule: 
  - ("Pay.gov integration...This is something that is possible and discussion with Pay.gov can be arranged." P4)



**Immediate action items for VODA:**
- Update all synthetic data issues on mock ups.
  -  Update synthetic data in Past Statement mockup with amount higher than $25. ("Mailed statements are not generated on balances under $25." P1)
  - Update synthetic data on Summary page. Update locations to different cities.
  - Add year on past statement
  
**Future action items for VODA:**
- Confirm all phone numbers are correct. 
   - ("Please make sure the phone numbers listed are accurate and get the person to the service they are seeking." P9)
  - Confirmation of correct contact info.
    - ("Note: If your address has changed call 1-866-260-2614". This is incorrect information, the POC for updating addresses is NOT the Health Resource Center. This needs to be updated to generate CPAC contact information." P4)
