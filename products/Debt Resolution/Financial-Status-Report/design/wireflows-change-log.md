# FSR Wireflows Change Log

## Wireflow V2
**Date:** November 30, 2021
![V2](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/Debt%20Resolution/Financial-Status-Report/assets/FSR%20List%20Loop%20Redesign%20-%20Ideation%20v1.jpg?raw=true)

**Feedback/Notes:**
- This major redesign was done to eliminate the current list loops as they performed poorly during usability testing, and the global move toward asking one question per page. This outline represents each of the list loops that will be gutted and replaced, while leaving untouched pages alone.



## Wireflow V1.1
**Date:** October 22, 2020

**Feedback/Notes:**
- **DMC Presentation Feedback:**
  - Include email collection on the content page
  - Default employment income to include gross salary and deduction information, because it is helpful when people have allotments
  - Expand the employment question to include more than just employed/unemployed (seasonally employed)
  - Expand the marital information to include more context on separation or multiple households
  - Think about how we will direct veterans to appeals after a decision has been reached [Debt Portal]
  - Spouse signature will not need to be collected since only a Veteran can access VA.gov officially, per OGC
  - Trailers, boats, or campers to also include RVs
  - Automobiles should be renamed vehicles and include subtext to include cars, motorcycles, ATVs, snowmobiles
  - Include more information on next steps once a form has been submitted

- **Mikki / Danielle Feedback:**
  - Content page should work more similar to the View / Add dependents setup (https://staging.va.gov/view-change-dependents) 
  - "We had a similar situation for the view dependents/add dependents work, where there was one static page that served both functions - one was a view tool and the other was a form.   For that, we took the approach of having both ctas on the static page in the unauthenticated state - if you are already logged in, you would go straight there, if not, you would be prompted to login and then go to that tool."
