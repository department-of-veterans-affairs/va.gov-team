# FSR Preliminary Research

Digital Services Veterans Affairs (DSVA)

Riley Orr & Rebecca Walsh, September 2020

Financial Status Report (VA Form 5655)
======================================

The FSR is a 2-page form that is required by the Debt Management Center in order to consider a Veteran's request for an extended payment plan, compromise, or waiver.

Phillip Wachowiak's notes for assisting a Veteran with filling out the FSR (particularly for a waiver): 

1.  Be clear in what it is. Explain it is called both an FSR, which stands for Financial Status report or VA Form 5655. What it is asking for is a "snap shot" of the Vet's household monthly income. How much money comes in for their household each month? How much goes out, aka what are their bills, expenses, etc? What are their assets (like cars, stocks, property). We need to know after all their expenses are met, what, if anything, is left over for our collections. (keep in mind, our debts should be treated equally to their existing debts)

2.  At the top, be sure to at least fill out the SS in box 1. Tell them its location on the form (top left.) 

3.  It is very important box 3 is filled out (located top right of the form). The vet must tell us what they are asking of us in this box. Very important!

4.  Section 1 is the Vet's PII. Not just name and address, but dependents, and current or former employment

5.  Section 2 is the Vet's/Spouse income. Boxes 13-15 refer to current employment (ie what do they bring in both before and after taxes). Box 16 is any government benefit (including VA ((comp, edu, pen)) and SS payments). Be sure to point out this box. Spouse's income must be included. Remember this for the household. 

6.  Section 3 is their living expenses. Tell them to be as thorough as they can, we can't consider what we can't see. Even if they think we won't count it, put it on there anyway and let us make that call.

7.  Section 4 is also important. Box 24a requires them to take their income in box 17 and subtract their expenses in box 23. 24b is what do they want to pay. $0 is always unacceptable! Tell them to come up with something, anything they believe is feasible

8.  Section 5 is assets, fairly straight forward and section 6 is additional debts but specifically long term installments, such as student loans, credit cards, layaway, rental places. No living expenses should be placed here, that is for section 3. Be sure to tell them to total this section up and include it in Box 22 on the first page in section 3, where it needs to be added to their living expenses for box 23, giving us the best snap shot of ALL expenses.

9.  Section 7, if at any time the vet was in bankruptcy, we must know! Even if it was years ago, we are better safe than sorry

10. Finally, section 8, where we must have a signature of the Vet AND the spouse. Again, it may not be the Spouse's debt, but this is a HOUSEHOLD form, we assume they are one economic unit. What is one spouse's is another's, regardless on how that works in practice.

11. Overall, tell them not to be overwhelmed. We just need to know their financial situation to make the best determination. If they say most of it will be blank or zeros, that is ok. Some are not as filled as others. The more info they can provide, the more effective we can be. Tell them to carefully read the instructions, it is all laid out there. Encourage them to seek help if documentation like this causes stress. VSO are always happy to help or even family members. Direct them to our Debtman site, which also provides instructions. Be sure to mention NOT to fill this out in a browser, it will not save. The pdf must be downloaded to the device and then saved. And remind them to save copies!

    - What are examples of things Veterans put in this box?

3.  Dates (MM-YYYY) 

1.  Includes 'From' and 'To' boxes

2.  There's two jobs Veterans can put in this section

3.  The first job has 'Present' in the 'To' box - why is that?

1.  What is 'Name' supposed to be? Name of the business or name of the manager? How do Veterans interpret that?

2.  Is everything in this section required? What if a Veteran doesn't know their employer's address?

3.  Veterans most likely don't know this information off-hand - we should consider this in the design and try to bring it to users' attention on the intro screen

3.  Your spouse's employment

1.  The same questions as in 'Your employment experience' apply

2.  Veterans may not know this information off-hand - what happens when they reach this section of the form?

1.  Do they fill out the entire form with their spouse?

2.  Do they return to the form at a later time once they speak with their spouse?

3.  Do they fill in the portions of the form they're able to and give the form to their spouse to complete?

### Section II - Income

Self + Spouse columns for all the following fields

-   My hypothesis is that Veterans don't know a lot of this information about their own income as well as their spouse's income info off-hand 

1.  Monthly gross salary (before payroll deductions) 

1.  How does this work for folks who aren't salaried? Freelancers/contractors with irregular work? Seasonal employees?

2.  We will also likely want to make this info stand out on the intro page since folks may not know this info off-hand

3.  Payroll deductions (this is greyed out - is it just because this is the title of the section?)

1.  Federal, state, and local income taxes

1.  Is this a sum total of federal, state, and local income taxes, or should they be separated?

3.  Retirement

1.  What sort of accounts do we accept here? (Pensions, 401k, IRAs, 403b, 457)

2.  Does this include both employer-sponsored and private retirement accounts? 

5.  Social security

6.  Other (specify)

1.  What other deductions are common?

2.  What mistakes do Veterans make here?

8.  Total deductions

1.  We can calculate this for them by summing a-e

1.  I think I've seen another team use a similar tool - think it may be for an education tool

5.  Net take home pay

1.  We can calculate this by subtracting 14e from 13

7.  VA Benefits, Social Security, or Other Income (Specify source)

1.  Where would Veterans likely find each of these? 

1.  If separate sources, should we break this field up into multiple for the Veteran to save them the calculation? 

3.  What are common "Other" sources?

4.  Do Veterans have to specify the source for "VA Benefits" and "Social Security" incomes, or is that specific enough?

5.  Why is "Social Security" on the form twice? Is there a difference between the two fields?

9.  Total Monthly Net Income (Item 15 plus 16)

1.  We can calculate this by adding 15 and 16

### Section III - Expenses

Proof will not be asked in this form, but may be requested in the future.

-   My hypothesis is that a Veterans may find it difficult to differentiate between utilities, living expenses, and monthly payments on installment contracts or other debts

1.  Rent or Mortgage Payment

1.  Does Mortgage Payment include all housing related costs (e.g. property taxes, insurance, PMI, HOA/COD) or just loan payments?

2.  Are there any specific rent scenarios that impact the determination? (shared property, irregular rent?)

3.  Food 

1.  Does this include only groceries or also eating out, etc.? 

5.  Utilities and heat

1.  Are there specific utilities that are accepted? (e.g. electricity, gas, water/sewage, trash/recycling, internet, landline, cable, cellular, home security)

7.  Other Living Expenses

1.  What sort of expenses typically go here?

1.  Car payments?

3.  What sort of expenses are obstinately not accepted?

9.  Monthly Payments on Installment Contracts or Other Debts

1.  What are applicable Installment Contracts?

2.  What are examples of 'Other debts'?

3.  What sort of things should go in box 21 vs 22? (Car insurance vs. Car loan payment?)

11. Total Monthly Expenses

1.  Can we just can calculate this by adding 18-22? (it doesn't note this in the form)

### Section IV - Discretionary income

24a. Net monthly income less expenses (Item 17 less Item 23)

1.  Does this mean Item 17 (total monthly net income) minus Item 23 (total monthly expenses)? 

1.  We can calculate it for the Veteran

24b. Amount you can pay on a monthly basis toward your debt

1.  How can we ease Veterans' stress around this question and help them decide an amount they're comfortable with?

2.  Do call center reps help Veterans determine a comfortable amount? If so, how do they approach the situation?

3.  What is the general guidance for reasonable payments from this surplus? (if a Veteran had $100 left over after monthly expenses, is the VA apt to ask for all of it?)

25\. Cash in bank (checking and savings accounts, building and loan accounts. etc)

1.  What makes up "etc."? 

2.  What is "building and loan accounts"?

3.  How exact are these figures meant to be? Should users be concerned with pending transactions or will a simple figure at that point in time suffice?

4.  Should users be concerned with providing proof of a balance at a specific point in time?

26\. Cash on hand

1.  What is considered "cash on hand"? 

1.  Money in safes? 

2.  Money in their wallet?

3.  "Cash on hand is the total amount of any accessible cash. According to "Entrepreneur" magazine, it refers to any available cash regardless of whether it is in your pocket or your bank account. Investments that you can convert to cash in 90 days or less are typically included when calculating your cash on hand." - [source](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/difference-between-petty-cash-cash-hand-51922.html)

27\. Automobiles (resale value)

1.  Is this automobiles owned exclusively by the Veteran, or do they also list automobiles owned by their spouse? 

2.  How should Veterans determine the resale value of their automobiles? Do we have any rules/limitations about recommending ways for them to determine resale value?

28\. Trailers, boats, campers

1.  Same q about whether or not spouse-owned items are included

29\. U.S. Savings bonds (current value)

30\. Stocks and other bonds (current value)

1.  What are "other bonds"? 

31\. Real estate owned (resale value) 

1.  How do Veterans determine resale value? Zillow or something? 

32\. Other assets (specify below)

1.  What are examples of other assets DMC expects?

2.  What are examples of other assets Veterans include? 

3.  Are there some assets Veterans commonly include that they don't necessarily need to?

33\. Total assets 

1.  We can calculate 4 them

### Section VI - Installment contracts and other debts

34\. Installment contracts and other debts

1.  Name and address of creditor

1.  What constitutes an acceptable creditor name? (e.g. I have a Paypal loan (backed by Synchrony) for an online appliance store -- which is the intended creditor for this section?

2.  Are individuals appropriate creditors? (i.e. for a personal loan from family)

3.  Are creditor addresses necessary for this? It seems unlikely that this would be easily accessible

3.  Date and purpose of debt

1.  Can these be split up?

2.  What is "purpose of debt"? Is car, television, etc. the purpose?

3.  What are common responses to "purpose of debt"?

4.  Can we get a definitive list of "purpose of debt"s expected? This may help Veterans identify what they should include 

5.  Original amount of debt

1.  How exact do these figures need to be? 

7.  Unpaid balance

1.  How exact do these figures need to be? At what point in time?

9.  Amount due monthly

1.  "NOTE: If repayment of a debt is not on a monthly basis, write "0" in column E and describe arrangements to repay in Item 36."

1.  Item 36 is just extra space to write additional information

11. Amount past due (if any)

12. Total

1.  We can calculate

### Section VII - Additional Data

35a. Have you ever been adjudicated bankrupt? If so and VA or a mortgage company was involved, please send all pertinent documentation

1.  What does "pertinent documentation mean?

2.  Should we include an "upload document" feature?

35b. Date discharged from bankruptcy (MM-DD-YYYY)

1.  "A bankruptcy discharge is the desired result of a bankruptcy case. It means there's a court order in your bankruptcy case that removes your debts.

35c. Location of Court

1.  What should be included in this field? State, city?

35d. Docket No (If known)

1.  How often do submitted forms have this field filled in?

36\. Use this space and additional sheets, if necessary, to supply any pertinent information and to continue your answer to previous item number(s) to which your comments apply

1.  What item numbers do Veterans typically include additional information for? 

2.  What kind of additional information is included?

3.  How long are additional information responses generally?

4.  How does the information submitted in this field differ from the written letter that is provided aside from this form? ([referenced here](https://www.va.gov/debtman/Submit_A_Waiver_Request.asp))

5.  This space probably will not be necessary once digitized

### Section VII - Applicant Certifications - Required

37a. Your signature (Required)

1.  Still determining how we capture this

37b. Date signed

38a. Signature of spouse (required)

1.  If folks answer "not married" we can just hide all spouse fields and whatever we're doing to capture signatures 

38b. Date signed

1.  Is this generally the same date as 37b?

2.  We may not need to include date fields depending on how we're capturing signatures (since we can just automatically input the current date)

PENALTY: The law provides severe penalties which include fine or imprisonment, or both, for the willful submission of any statement or evidence of a material fact,

knowing it to be false.
