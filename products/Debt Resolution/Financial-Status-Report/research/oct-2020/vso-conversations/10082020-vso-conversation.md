# VSO Conversation 1

October 8, 2020 

## Topline summary

_There were two VSOs in this meeting_

- Assists with at least 2 FSRs a month, but once the form is submitted they don’t hear anything back about whether or not a waiver, compromise offer, or extended payment plan was approved

- Veterans come to VSOs for help when their benefits stop and they aren’t sure why

- VSOs always suggest submitting for a waiver if they’re in hardship; if the Veteran isn’t experiencing hardship then they suggest a compromise or payment plan

- Block 21 is the most challenging section for Veterans because they include things that may not count as living expenses such as cell phones

- Younger Veterans don’t have file numbers, so their SSN counts as the file number 

- Some Veterans write “homeless” or “unemployed” in box 3

- If a Veteran or their spouse is unemployed, VSOs have to write “N/A” in all corresponding boxes that require an employment response

- Sometimes it’s difficult to find all the information for 14 a-d

- It isn’t clear if Veterans should include their VA benefit amount if it’s being used to offset the debt, so VSOs tell them to put what they’re receiving at the time the form is being completed

- VSOs aren’t sure what the criteria is for “other living expenses” (line 21)

- The amount from the second page of the form isn’t carried over to line 22

- People include expenses in line 21 that are covered in 22

- The VSOs don’t often submit compromise offers 

- Veterans often don’t know if they should include their vehicle because either they’re worried they may have to sell it or they don’t think it’s relevant due to not contributing to their income

- Section 5: “The whole section makes it seem like it’s negative information.”

- The VSOs didn’t know about an additional letter, but said that explanations for waiver requests or extended payment plan is included in line 36

- The VSOs rarely see forms with spouse information. This might be because most of the Veterans they help aren’t married

- The VSOs fill out the form on the computer for the Veteran

## The transcript 

**M: Can you tell me about your experience with the FSR?**

C: The overall experience requires a lot of information especially on the part where they have debts, and obtaining that information. More or less the time to complete when the veterans don’t have all that information. When they get it mailed out to them and they don’t fill out every single block or fill out 0’s and it gets kicked back because they didn’t fill it out all the way. If you put the numbers in the PDF form it’ll calculate everything for you, and a lot of Veterans don’t know to pull the information from the second to first page

**M: How often do you help Veterans complete the FSR?**

C: Not much especially with the pandemic. Minimum, 2 a month

**M: So it’s often enough that it’s fresh for you?**

C: As far as the form itself, yeah. 

**M: How do you think Veterans feel about debt and the resolution process?**

C: Confusing. I mean, we can submit the waiver or payment options to DMC but after that you don’t really hear anything back on our side. It’s always done as a letter or phone call to the Veteran

**M: Do you think there should be more communication?**

C: I think just the documents that go from debt management into VBMS so we have access to it. With our accesses we don’t get much access to DMC things. We can only see what’s in VBMS. We’d be able to see, understand it, and explain it to Veterans better

**M: At what point do you Veterans approach you for help?**

C: When their benefits stop and they don’t receive it and they don’t know why

**M: So you tell them what happened and what they can do?**

C: Yup! By submitting a waiver or if we represent the Veteran and we can’t see anything as far as why they didn’t receive their benefit. So we reach out to DMC. 

**M: Do you help a Veteran determine which request they should submit?**

C: Yeah. If they understand that they forgot to report the dependency we feel for where the Veteran is at. If they’re in hardship, then we’ll initiate a waiver. But if not and they can do something, then we go for payment plan or compromise

**M: What parts of the form are most challenging?**

C: Block 21 under living expenses. They can try including a lot of stuff that isn’t a living expense like cell phones. That part and probably the overall section 5 and assets. A lot have vehicles but they don’t understand that… I guess that could be considered assets. They VA will deny the waiver. The asset part is confusing to them 

**M: I put together a whiteboard that has little snapshots of all the parts of the form (explaining the activity).** 

## Form Info

**M: Can you tell me about how Veterans approach this section and any trouble?**

C: On my end I see yellow squares. 

**M: Yeah, it’s above**

C: Oh! I see. 

**M:  Yeah, any of these fields**

C: Gotcha. 

**M: Do they have questions or struggle?**

C: I would say no. A lot of younger Veterans don’t have file numbers. If they don’t have one then we let them know it’s the same as their SSN. The only one they have questions on is compromise. They don’t know what a compromise is

**M: Do they have an idea?**

C: It’s explained to them. You pay so much or inform VA that you’ll pay so much and they’ll respond that they’ll accept that compromise. It’s not explained. I’ve only seen one Veteran have a compromise in 8 years

**M: Really? Do they just not ask for it?**

C: It’s the communication portion of it. We can list compromise on the FSR and send it forward, but we don’t hear back. The Veteran contacted us and said debt management was willing to do a compromise and asked if they should take it

**M: What do they want to put here (box 3)?**

C: We have seen waiver/payment plan so if the waiver isn’t granted then they’ll get the payment plan. It’s usually one or the other or both. 

**M: If they do say waiver/payment plan, do they expect that the waiver would come first?**

C:Yeah, as. long as it’s within the time to file a waiver

**M: Have you ever seen other examples of things people write for “other”?**

C: Uhm, I have seen homeless where they write “homeless” there. MJ, have you seen anything?

MJ: Yeah, homeless or unemployed

**M: So, what happens if they need their money back?**

C: Call debt management, we can try to do it for them but we need a FSR vs the Veteran calling the DMC, they might accept a payment plan

**M: Refunds?**

C: Every once in a while. If they didn’t get the letter, what can be done? A payment plan for a year and refund the difference for that month. I mean, we have seen where they can do refunds. It’s not really explained to them when they talk to or receive something. It has to be explained

**M: If they’re not sure, how do you decide what to suggest to them?**

C: It’s mainly call the VA and see if they can get a payment plan over the phone. And depending on where they’re at and their timeline based on the letter we suggest a waiver or payment plan. We hardly ever send anything forward to DMC without a 5655. It’s almost a requirement for DMC 

**M: Is there anything else in this section?** 

C: I don’t think so 

## Section 1

**M: Where do people struggle and ask questions?**

C: I don’t think I’ve had anyone ask questions. Maybe why DMC needs to know the ages of kids. Why they need the ages of kids… and if that’s even taken into consideration. 

**M: Hm, okay. Do they have any questions about employment?**

MJ: I think it’d be nice if there was a box that said “not employed” or haven’t been employed in the past 2 years so we don’t have to put N/A in all the boxes

**M: What kind of things do people put in “kind of job”?**

MJ: Yeah, title. Type of occupation. 

**M: Is there anything else people get caught up on or confused about?** 

C: Nope

**M: Do Veterans know about their spouse’s employment?**

C: Some do but most of the time it’s a single Veteran or a Veteran that’s been divorced

**M: What if they don’t know their spouse’s employment info** 

C: It’s mainly towards section 2 for income. If they are married then they have to report that information. I know we’re not there yet but… are they employed, where do they work..

**M: Anything else?**

MJ: Does it matter what type of job? That whole category? Like you said, it breaks it down if they are or aren’t working and amount contributed each month 

C:  Like a box: are you employed? Another box for if your spouse is employed

MJ: Yeah, then you’d know to look at specific income for a spouse. If that area isn’t filled out but they were working. Even just putting job type, where they work, I don’t know if that authorizes VA to verify income 

## Section 2

**M: Do you have general insights on how people approach this or struggle?**

C: If it’s calculated out for them, block E. is usually fine. Block 17 usually gets calculated out for them 

**M: Yeah. If they aren’t being calculated for them it’s a sticking point?**

C: Right. They don’t know what to put in there. We know items 14a - 14d get put in that area, but. 

**M: But they don’t?**

C: Right

**M: Do you find that Veterans struggle providing this information?**

C: If they’ve received the letter or don’t get a benefit payment, then they need to get a pay stub to find that info

**M: Is that difficult for them?**

C: Sometimes

**M: Do you tell them how to find it?**

C: Contact the employer and see if you can get a statement. Or get a monthly statement online 

**M: Are they coming to you in person and need to come back?**

C: We’ll fill it out the best as we can but we try not to send it forward to DMC if it’s not complete because it delays the claim and requires additional development. You put 14a as $1200 but didn’t complete “this”, it delays the additional development 

**M: Alright! Do Veterans understand payroll deductions?** 

C: Comes right from their pay stub. I wonder if it’s as simple as putting monthly income, maybe. 

MJ: Yeah, without the breakdown

C: Yeah

**M: Because getting this stuff is difficult?**

C: Sometimes, yeah. It’s a lot easier for a Veteran to say how much they made last month and pull up a bank account and see deposit. Then we can see how much they made 

MJ: If they get the spouse’s information then it’s more difficult to get federal state income without the pay stub. But in a shared account they can see from each other’s sides 

**M: VA benefits, SS, and other income. Do they know this info off-hand?**

C: Sometimes. They also ask, “VA’s already taking my benefit, so I’m not getting a VA benefit right now”. Or they’ve already established a payment plan but they’re trying to go for a lower payment plan. So they ask if they put their full amount or what they get currently

**M: Do you know the answer?**

C: I tell them to put what they’re getting now. If they’re not getting anything, don’t put anything

MJ: Is that correct though? There’s no rules about how to fill out each section. It would be helpful for 16. VA benefit prior to reductions or something

C: There ya go. What should you be receiving? What are you receiving?

**M: So for other forms you have documentation for how to fill out?**

MJ: yeah, everything for C&P comes with a breakdown for each section. It would tell you word-for-word what’s expected

**M: This one doesn’t have that?**

MJ: Right

**M: Interesting… have you ever seen anything enter anything for other income?**

C: Uhm, 

MJ: I haven’t

C: I have one, but it was for a piece of property where they got a monthly check from a local farmer 

**M: Interesting!**

C: Yeah. That was an income they got monthly, so

**M: Yeah, or a rental**

MJ: Yeah! Any income property I suppose 

## Section 3

**M: Expenses! Where do people struggle?**

MJ: Other

C: Yeah, other is a big one. If there were examples that’d be great. Sometimes the rent is incorporated with the utilities for the person if they’re living in a townhouse or something and utilities is incorporated in their rent. 

**M: Do they ever have questions about what’s included? Property taxes and stuff?**

C: No. Just how much you pay for rent/mortgage per month. It’s simple. 

**M: Do they know how much they spend on food?**

MJ: It varies

C: Yeah,  family or kids.. what have you. I mean it’s a big difference between a person coming to us.. and you think about $50 and that’s like a week. You have to refer them back to a month

MJ: Yeah, maybe put “monthly” next to it even if it’s up top

**M: What sort of things do people put for “other”**

C: Insurance

MJ: Clothes, but that says living expense. I don’t know what the breakdown criteria is the VA is looking for

C: Yeah.. bathing, cleaning supplies

**M: Do you find that people aren’t including all their expenses?**

C: I know we mentioned cell phones as far as a living expense. Like, is it really? For some people they really do need it. Talking with doctors, emergency phone calls, or what have you.

MJ: Yeah. I think just incorporating bills in there would make sense instead of just utilities and heat. Insurance is a monthly expense already spoken for. 

**M: So, it’s just very unclear what belongs to which section?**

MJ: Right. It gets convoluted between 20 and 21 even though 20 is more specific. 

**M: So for utilities and heat, do they take this as phone bill or cable bill, or is it just electric and propane?** 

C: Electric and propane or utility bill from the city

**M: So that includes water**

MJ: Right

**M: What about 22? What struggles there?** 

C: They don’t read it or do online version. The amount from the second page isn’t carried over. 

**M: Do they know what’s asked there?**

C: No idea. No one. 

**M: Is there anything else in this section?**

C: If there were like… block 21 is long. They can list everything in there but do they know to add them all up and put one amount towards the bottom right side. We help them and tell them. For example clothes for $200, so clothes - $200 and put a final amount under the amount column there. 

**M: How many other living expenses do people add?**

MJ: A lot that would be in 22

**M: What do they do when they’ve added it here?**

MJ: Typically we see the 5655 come through but we don’t see the in depth. 

**M: So they duplicate?**

MJ: Right. Or they don’t fill it out

## Section 4

**M: Do they struggle coming up with this amount?**

MJ: They put 10, 20, 50. 

C: 0

**M: So it could say $2000 in here (24a) and they’ll put $50?**

MJ: Yeah

C: With us knowing the debt management. process, the 5655 could potentially get them a. 2 year payment plan. What they don’t know is there is a 3 or 5 year plan at the discretion of a supervisor in debt man. That won’t be considered by a DMC personnel without it being put there. We write it in there “3 year payment plan by supervisor” even if it may carry out longer 

**M: What’s the highest debt you’ve seen?**

C: $4-500,000. A veteran incarcerated and VA never caught that. 

**M: Can you imagine paying that off in two years? Five years? I didn’t know they got that high. I was thinking $20k** 

C: I’ve seen that

MJ: Yeah that happens if they don’t report the death of a spouse

**M: It says the amount you can pay on a monthly basis. I’ve heard it being used for compromise offers as well** 

C: That does make sense if they go for a compromise. Another question could be, “how much could you compromise?” I’ve never thought about that

MJ: Yeah, that’s something we don’t use as often 

## Section 5

C: If that section could go to an explanation of some things there. 25 and 26 is easy. But an additional… informal sheet or something 

MJ: Explanation?

C: Yeah, that’s the word 

**M: They tend to not understand the other ones? Which ones?**

C: If they should put their vehicle in there. 

MJ: What the resale value is without having to look up blue book on it. 

**M: Do you suggest blue book?**

MJ: Yeah

**M: Why do you think they don’t know to include cars?**

MJ: I feel like it’s like if their vehicle is worth a lot of money they’ll get denied on a waiver request. Why not sell it, get a cheaper one, to pay off the debt?

C: They say they do own a vehicle but it doesn’t contribute to their income. We’ve had them ask why it’s relevant because they have to pay for it

**M: They aren’t sure how their 2009 Kia worth $4k really impact the decision.** 

C: Right

**M: So more context**

C: Right

MJ: The whole section makes it seem like it’s negative information. 

C: Or all 0’s. I see a lot of that. 

**M: Do you think the 0’s are fraudulent? Or they don’t have bonds, real estate.** 

C: Not fraudulent, no. They don’t have it or understand. 

MJ: If an explanation sheet includes if they have a blank if they need to put N/A or 0. It causes slower development

**M: Have you seen people use “other assets”?**

MJ/C: No

MJ:  They got trailers, boats, campers all there. Real estate..

**M: Yeah and motorcycle is under automobiles** 

[One participant jumps off] 

**M: Anything else in this section?**

MJ: Nah, I think we covered it all. It has to have something whether it’s 0 or N/A. I don’t know if most Veterans know what a stock or bond is. Anything getting for 401k for other income. Number 16 is for reductions for retirement. 

**M: So receiving 401k...** 

MJ: A lot of Veterans or dependents are retired and are receiving these. Even if it just had “retirement” added to that part instead of “other income”. “VA benefits, social security, or other income”. 

**M: Now I wonder if the total of retirement accounts are valid to put here (32)** 

MJ: Yeah, it’s technically an asset. 

**M: I want to say no because these are protected assets. I don’t know.** 

Section 6

**M: Do you have any thoughts about where people struggle?** 

MJ: I think it’s pretty self-explanatory because there’s a note. They put a lot of television, those bills up above under “other” because it’s separated initially and then they won’t fill this part out. 

**M: Do you see that they get kicked back?** 

MJ: I don’t typically see much of that because the correspondence is DMC <> Claimant. They only contact us if payment stops or they receive a letter. We don’t know if it gets kicked back. We have no clue of the status. We don’t see a copy of that letter. 

**M: In your experience, they just do the other side and skip this?**

MJ: Right. What we take up to DMC is 5655. Not even the back portion that’s signed. They will just work on the top portion. 

**M: I didn’t think it would be accepted with this part omitted.** 

MJ: Right, cuz there’s a signature portion, bankruptcy. 

**M: Anything else?**

MJ: I guess more-or-less they just don’t add up everything. If they do then they don’t think to carry it to the front page unless it’s done for them. 

Section 7

**M: Bankruptcy?**

MJ: Not many say yes. They’ll mark one or the other and leave the rest blank (B-D)

**M: What do you see people write for 36?**

MJ: More-or-less an explanation why they’re requesting the waiver or payment plan as if it’s a statement. So if it could be bigger or “statement in support of ___” or whatever specific thing they’ve identified at the top. More in-depth information from their standpoint. We’ve seen that they’re not working so they need to keep the benefit currently and want to pay it back [in the future]. They just want to prevent it from going to collections. We will send eviction notices in support of getting the waiver approved sooner. It’s a last hoorah to have someone understand the situation and why they’re submitting the FSR 

**M: How does this section play in with the letter?** 

MJ: I don’t know what that letter.

**M: You don’t have anyone submit an additional letter?**

MJ: I don’t know if they request that after we’ve submitted. We just let the Veteran know this is the first step. We use centralized mail portal for claims, but DMC seems separate from any of the regular practices. 

**M: Anything else in this section or way we can improve this?** 

MJ: Nothing really. Maybe just make that space longer (36). I know they were probably trying to keep it to two pages. 

## Section 8 

**M: Do you find that the signature of the spouse is ever an issue?**

MJ: Rarely do we see one where it has spouse information on it anyway. I don’t know if they opt not to put spouse information on there or they aren’t married. A majority we get is from other states because there’s no way to submit an application to a DMC directly as a VSO. So they’re emailed to us from every state and we have to print them off and walk them upstairs for intake.

MJ: So whenever it is sent out to a Veteran to fill out online - how does the DAV or VSO assist? 

**M: How do you help Veterans fill out other online forms like the 10-10CG or 526-EZ?**

MJ: DAV has their own system that auto-fills their own system into any form. We just basically digitally sign, download it, upload it to the mail portal. 

**M: Do you fill out the form for the Veteran?**

MJ: We will it out for them. We’ll ask them questions.  They can’t even see the computer. Most of it we’ll already know because we have their personal data or we can access VBMS. We will ask them if they can obtain information they don’t have and we’ll either submit it that way or print it out and send it with them 

**M: Do they see the form before signing it?**

MJ: Yeah, they’ll have the paper form with them. We just engage it into the online and we’ll swivel and have them verify the information. Then we’ll save and upload. 

**M: Are you able to have the Veteran log into their account and fill it out with your assistance?**

MJ: We get calls from Veterans and can’t do certain things. But we’ll guide them through steps within… (interrupted by a message)

MJ: We’ll let them know all the applications are available. Once they have the form filled up it’s mostly self-explanatory and they’ll shoot an email or give us a call back. Anything and everything we’re able to do as their POA we take care of everything so they don’t have to think or figure it out. 

**M: How do you get POA?**

MJ: We have POA for any Veteran, dependent, who fills out 21-22 who wants to give POA. 99% of Veterans have a veteran-services organization. They usually go after someone because forms tell them the importance of having a VSO. 

**M: How do you know?**

MJ: In VBMS whenever we’re doing search for their information or pull up claims file it’ll give us access. If they don’t then we’ll put it up in Share and we’ll tell them who they’re represented by.
