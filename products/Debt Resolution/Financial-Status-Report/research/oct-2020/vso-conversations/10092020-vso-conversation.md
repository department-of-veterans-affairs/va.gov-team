# VSO Conversation 2

_There are two participants in this call. They are labled as 'P' and 'P2'_

## Topline Summary

- Veterans come in for help filling out the form and they don’t have any references for parts of the form they need to complete, but VSOs don’t want to leave any form input fields empty for fear it’ll negatively impact the final decision

- “I think they’re bewildered. If it’s a large debt they’re freaked out when we see them, especially the older ones. They’re panic-stricken.”

- Veterans usually come for assistance after their benefits are already being seized

- One of the VSOs mentioned that they spend time making sure the Veteran’s debt is legitimate and get it fixed if it’s not an appropriate debt

- Sometimes VSOs have to write in “waiver” for box 3 because that field will be blank

- Most Veterans they help are on pension or social security, retired from the military, so they’re unemployed 

- They think it should be sufficient to just put down take-home pay in section 2

- Even if a Veteran’s benefits were being offset for the debt, both VSOs stated that they’d tell the Veteran to put the gross amount they’d receive

- Veterans usually know their spouse’s net income, but not the breakdown of payroll deductions

- These VSOs work in the same building as DMC, so they’ll oftentimes go to the DMC’s office to haggle for payment plans or compensation offers

- Sometimes Veterans can’t afford to pay anything, so the amount in 24b will be blank or have a negative number even though DMC will require some sort of payment amount

- VSOs have to look up car values in blue book 

- Some Veterans have other debts (included in section 6) that they can’t afford to pay and they no longer know how much the debt is for

- The VSOs have Veterans complete VA form 21-4138 when providing additional information about their waiver/payment plan request rather than filling out box 36 

- If the Veteran needs to get a spouse’s signature, one of the VSOs stated that they have the Veteran bring the form back rather than mail it to DMC because it’s time sensitive and the VSOs can go upstairs directly to DMC

## General Questions

**M: Can you tell me more about your experiences dealing with the FSR?**

P: one of the problems is that, for example a Vet will come in and they won’t have the address for their creditor. They don’t know how long the debt is running and they don’t know the original amount. They’ll sit in my office and call their wife at home to try to find the bill. I don’t know why we need to know the original amount of the debt. Sometimes they’ll have a couple credit cards but they won’t know the original amount of the debt or employer address. We don’t want to send them home to find stuff. I don’t know why you need to know all that stuff. Some of the things asked for… the purpose is not clear to me. I don’t like to leave a box unfilled for fear it will void the request. I think all the data about the automobiles is excessive too. 

**M: How do you think Veterans feel about their debts and the process as a whole?**

P: I think they’re bewildered. If it’s a large debt they’re freaked out when we see them, especially the older ones. They’re panic-stricken. Especially with pension debts. Those people are so low-income anyway that… I dunno it seems like they’re pretty upset when we see them

P2: A lot of times when we get involved it’s too late. When IRS might be taking or off-setting

P: Or their VA benefits checks are seized. That’s when we usually get involved

P2: Yeah they see if we can help them resolve something. A lot of times we take things into our own hands if it was dependent-based and we can fix it. As far as within the 30 days.. normally the service officers in the field possibly, but mostly they come when it’s too late. We have to see if it can be fixed

P: If we’re within the timeline for a waiver. We can still submit a 5655 to potentially get a lower payment. 

**M: You said that people tend to feel bewildered. Is there anything you do to help quell those fears?**

P: Well, we talk to them about getting a payment plan set up. We’ll also figure out what resulted in the debt and whether or not that’s legitimate. Mostly by the time we get there they’ve had their entire VA check seized, but we have to sit down on the spot to fill out a 5655. Sometimes we have to help over the phone. Right now a lot of offices are closed. A lot of times Veterans just don’t have the information. If you know up front that they’re coming in you can tell them to bring a copy of their bills. They may or may not do it. Sometimes we wing the amounts we put down because we don’t have the data and neither does the Vet sometimes

**M: How often do you help complete the FSR?**

P: Um, we probably do… I probably only do 1 a month. Not even that. 

P2: They come to us from people in the field who fill them out. We look at 10-15 that come through us on a regular basis. Every 2 weeks or something like that

**M: You have different roles?**

P2: Yeah Veterans call us if they have issues with debt management and we go talk to the people up there or the supervisors and they can look at things. They can critique what’s happened. We have two different roles 

P: Lately I’ve been investigating the cause. P2 will handle the waiver and payment plan and the immediate lease actions, and I will go and see what caused the debt and see if it was legitimate or not and get it fixed on the RO side. Sometimes it’ll take longer but it helps the Vet. Some of the debts are pretty inappropriate 

**M: How do you help them decide to submit a waiver or payment plan?**

P: If we’re within 30 days or 180 days we always submit a waiver

P2: Yup, if a waiver is denied we’ll tell them to come in with a comp offer 

P: It depends on where they are in the process. If it’s already in collections then normally speaking they’re way beyond the waiver point. We also go back and see if they applied for a waiver before and if it was denied properly. I mean, I saw one recently where the Vet didn’t submit a 5655 but he submitted a waiver in the original timeframe but it was never processed. We look back in the file, and I have more time than P2, and I try to figure out what happened originally. Even if we can’t fix it, that information is very helpful at the waiver board. If you can show them that the debt wasn’t legitimate then they’re more likely to grant a waiver

**M: So if you feel it’s illegitimate, you suggest a waiver rather than a dispute**

P: If we can get the RO to fix it we will. I had one recently where they had a child taken off that happened in a distant past. When they put the child back on, they put him on 10 years later, I was able to get that fixed by emailing a coach upstairs and they realized it was wrong. Sometimes we can do something like that even if it’s old. That one was far along in the process when we found it. 

**M: [Explains FSR activity]** 

## Workshop

### Form Info

**M: Where do people struggle?** 

P: That part is fine. 

**M: Even the “why are you completing this form”?**

P2: A lot of things I come across is the service officers in the field don’t understand the process. Often they leave it blank so we have to write in “waiver”. If we have POA then we can. They may have a cover letter requesting a waiver so I fill it in. I’ve seen them circle waiver. I don’t know if that’s appropriate. If we know it’s an actual waiver request we put that in the box. 

**M: Do you ever offer multiple options at once?**

P1: Yeah it depends. If they know it’s a legit debt then we ask  them what they’re willing to pay back. So we’ll put repayment plan and how much. 

P2: Sometimes the waiver will take a while. If the person has had their entire VA check recouped and they can’t get by through the end of the month then we’ll try to set up a payment plan in the interim so they can get some of that check back. We try to give them some sort of relief

**M: So what would you put?**

P1: I would put waiver up there (Box 3) and then under amount paid I will put an amount (24b)

### Section 1

**M: Anything people struggle with here?**

P1: Nope, I don’t think so

P2: We have had to look up addresses of employers sometimes

**M: Do you find those important?**

P: Sometimes it’s the same place where the vet works if they’re working. Most of our Vets aren’t working. I’ve had to look up addresses on the internet. 

**M: What do you do when they’re not working?**

P: I mean… normally they’re on pension or social security, retired from the military. 

**M: So how do you fill it out?**

P: If neither he nor she has any employment, you put down their name, number, marital status, and write N/A for the rest

**M: Anything else that Veterans wonder why it’s being asked or are resistant?** 

P: No, not in that part really.  Can we put N/A in the boxes that don’t apply?

**M: I don’t know the answer to that.** 

### Section 2

**M: Where do you see people struggling with this?** 

P: I think, like most of them aren’t working. But if they do and they don’t happen to have a check with them… I mean it should be sufficient to put down what their take-home is. A lot of times they don’t know their gross salary. You really have to have a check with you. And we don’t get Vets who are completely prepared. In certain situations we end up with asking what their take-home pay is. They usually know that because that’s what they live on. They don’t know what their share of social security is. And I don’t know why you guys need to know that either. That might be something where you might want to ask if they’re contributing to 401k and pension plan and how much they’e contributing. How much they’re paying into social security… I mean that’s not something they have a choice about so it gets taken out. If you know the take-home pay and they aren’t contributing large amounts then that should be sufficient. The other thing too is that this is monthly. I just think the way it’s done is a lot of unnecessary details. 

**M: What about… that basically covers 13-15. What about 16? This seems funky. There’s multiple sources here. How do you approach that?**

P: Usually we break it out. Like, say they get X amount of VA benefits then we’ll put it in and write “VA” under it. Then we break out social security. There’s room to put a couple things 

**M: So do they put their total entitled benefit or what they’re actually receiving? So if it’s being deducted, does it have that included or not**

P: If a veteran is 100% then they get 30 - if they have a spouse they get $3300 a month. With social security you have Medicare taken out. 

P2: Could have taxes taken out of social security too. 

**M: Say someone comes to you and VA is taking $300 out of $500 for their benefit checks. Do you put $200 or $500?**

P: I would put the gross. 

P2: Yeah, I put the gross amount in. 

**M:  Do you know if… if someone’s receiving disability,  compensation,  as well as education benefits, do they get separate checks for that?**

P: Yup. They get separate checks but we can’t always see those. Voc Rehab for example, we can’t see them. I suppose we could extrapolate it from VBMS but it would be tedious. I don’t honestly think GI Bill… 

P2: They’re in Shares, yeah. You can see where someone’s getting CH 33 benefits. You’ll see their checks in the Share screen but there used to be an education screen where we could see entitlement. You can at least see in the payment history screen that they’re getting that income in there.

P: Not Voc Rehab

P2: Voc Rehab is in there too

**M: What other stuff have you seen?**

P: Sometimes there’s military retirement. If they’re getting… that could be under Retirement I think. Under certain circumstances they get military retirement that needs to be broken up 

**M: Do people know their spouse’s information?**

P: Usually they kind of know approximately. If you pay bills at home you know who’s getting what but they won’t have deductions or anything like that. I guess you could picture instances where they won’t know their spouse’s income. Sometimes they come in with their spouse, but not always.

**M: Anything else?**

P: Nope, we’re good

### Section 3

**M: Where do people struggle?**

P: They have a hard time guesstimating. They know what their rent or mortgage payment is. They have trouble guesstimating food. They need to put down for car insurance, gas, incidentals, internet, otherwise they won’t put it down. They oftentimes won’t know to put gas down. 

**M: What are things you see that people commonly omit, like gasoline?**

P: Things they forget? 

**M: Yeah**

P: If we have them sitting there we’ll try to get it out. We’re guesstimating. 

**M:  Do you have a list?**

P: We always make sure they put down car insurance, car payments, I don’t know. It varies case-by-case. 

**M: We’re trying to figure out what these other living expenses are so we can suggest them.**

P:  You have utilities and heat. Are you talking about electric, gas, but typically most people have cable and internet and stuff like that.

P2: Cell phone

P: Okay, just being realistic here I’m 1 person but my cable bill is $160, cell phone has a monthly fee. Are they necessities or.. to me there’s a conflict. It’s not a utility but other living expenses would be internet, tv, phone, car insurance, homeowners insurance.

P2: We probably should have a list

P: If their house is paid off then they have to pay taxes and insurance. I don’t know if it’s on the back page or not.

**M: So you don’t include property taxes and stuff in the mortgage?**

P: If they have a mortgage, yeah. But if they don’t have a mortgage then you have to list them all out. But if their house is paid off them it has to be broken out monthly. Normally they don’t pay those monthly. 

**M: What about 22? Does this confuse people?**

P: Yeah, on the backside 

P2: Do you really need the address?

P: Do you check them and can they check them? Pension management center can go to social security and get information, they can go to IRS and get information. For most people it’s being reported right away. Can you do a credit check? Can that be done? Can you guys look that stuff up?

**M: We’re not actually debt management. We’re working with debt management.** 

P:  Oh! Certain agencies in the VA can cross-reference the IRS for income. You’d think, like i said, the form is complicated for some people. Is debt management actually looking at it?

P2: Do they really need the address to the creditor? The Vet will have to look it up. I don’t know why they need it anyway 

P: That’s to offset monthly expenses 

P2: But do they need the address?

**M: Probably not.** 

P: Just put Capital One and the 1800 number. If you’re helping people fill this out, they’re not gonna have everything and you’re gonna have to go on the internet to find all this out and I don’t see the purpose unless they’re sending letters or calling them. I don’t think that’s what they’re doing because they’re swamped

**M: Do you find that people fill this out (Section 6) completely and go back and fill it out?**

P: Carrying it over to box 22 at the front?

**M: Do you find that people are trying to put the same expenses multiple times?**

P: I don’t really think so. 

**M:  Anything else about this section? (section 3)**

P: Uhm, the original amount of the debt is something I was wondering too. Vets might not know that (section 6). Oh I see you hopped back to the front.

### Section 4

**M: What about this section? How do you go about suggesting a payment amount here?**

P: Well, the debt management has some minimums. I heard that this is changing, but they want the debt paid off within 12 months. I heard it’s gonna go up to 36 months. If you have a debt that’s $96k that’s not gonna be paid off in 12 months. So then we will go to, regardless of the amount, we go up to debt management and haggle with the to see what they’ll do. Then we’ll go back to the Vet and tell them the least amount that they will accept. 

**M: Do you fill this out with them always or do you ever leave it blank?**

P: If I’m filling the form out then I’ll always put something. Sometimes it’s a minus. Like sometimes expenses feed into income and they can’t afford to pay anything. Regardless of the amount put in the box, they’re gonna tell us what the minimum amount can be. It’s not gonna be nothing no matter how broke the guy is.

**M: Anything else about this section?**

P: No

### Section 5

**M: Where do people struggle or have questions?** 

P: Well, I also think it’s unnecessary in most cases to know what kind of car they have and what it’s worth, what its resale value is. We’ll have to look it up - typically they don’t know. I suppose there could be a case where someone has a Mercedes they’re sitting on, but normally people have to keep their cars. Maybe they have a nice car but they fell on hard times recently. You can’t really tell the Vet to sell the car. It causes me anxiety when I have to get them to come up with those figures

**M: How do you do that?**

P: I look them up on blue book. Normally I ask the Vet what they think the car is worth. If there’s a loan then it’s easier. I tend to guesstimate, “What do you think it’s worth?” and they give me a figure.  I think that’s another thing where the chance of a Veteran having a car is so valuable that they don’t qualify for assistance are pretty slim. Usually we’re dealing with people who are in the bottom of the barrel. I think that’s why those questions are.. I mean pretty much everyone has a car but figuring out what the car is worth…

**M: What about the other areas? Do you see anything placed in “other assets”?**

P: I don’t really know what that would be. I don’t know if our Vets would have works of art or… jewelry… but like I say that’s not really the category of folks we’re dealing with. The most likely thing would be a lake cabin but that’s under real estate. Again, there’s question there because even Medicaid doesn’t expect you to declare the value of your house. That’s a question right there. If you have a lake cabin they’ll expect you to cash that out. I don’t know where DMC weighs in on that. 

**M: I think art and jewelry! Maybe watches?** 

P: Most of the Vets we deal with are waaaaay down there on the food chain. Older people living on social security or whatever. 

### Section 6

**M: Do you find that people struggle to find this information? Or do they know the amount paid monthly?**

P: Most of them kind of know what’s due monthly. That brings up an interesting point because I had a Vet recently who had a bunch of debts he stopped paying. Do they put it down if they’re no longer paying? You’ve thrown up your hands. You can put the amount passed due but they don’t know when they’ve stopped paying. They have a debt they just can’t pay so they stopped paying it. 

**M: Do people typically know what the date of their debt was? Month and year?**

P: No, they usually don’t know that. I’ll put like, 1991 with a question mark. If they don’t know, I don’t know. That’s not really something you can look up either.

**M: Anything else about this section?**

### Section 7 

**M: Do you commonly see people that check yes on the bankruptcy question?**

P: No, not too many. That’s one thing they do know. They don’t always know the timeframe, though. They’ll be able to answer yes or no, but I don’t know about additional information.

**M: What about 36?**

P: I normally leave that one blank. 

**M: Do you know anything about an additional letter that the DMC asks for?**

P: Oh, like a 4138? Explaining the financial situation? (Reads 36 out loud)

P2: Was your question about the additional sheets?

**M: On the debt man website it suggests a letter that explains your situation in human terms rather than exactly the amount made**

P: A compromise offer is buying the debt back. We don’t get those that often

P2: If the waiver has been denied and often when the debt goes to treasury the only way we can pull it back is a comp offer. I do tell Veterans that if it’s been denied, write a letter to DMC. It’s 21-4138 for support of a claim. We have the Vets fill that out and put the blank form and a request for a comp. They have to come in with an FSR also along with the statement that they’d like DMC to consider a compromise offer on the debt. Once that’s all filled out we bring it up to DMC. DMC will either grant or deny-

P: -Or offer counter.

P2: I don’t think they offer a counter. It all goes up to DMC and somebody looks at its and they come back and grant or deny. If they grant then they have to pay within 30 days and if they deny then they have to pay it back totally or whatever. It’s all based off the FSR. It’s usually 4138 or a letter requesting a waiver

**M: What info do they provide in the letter or 4138?**

P: It’s just their situation. What’s gone on, why they can’t pay it all back. It’s a blank form VA has in their system. When anything additionally needs to be said it’s on that form. It’s a blank form where they can write anything they want to on it. It has their name, social number, all that stuff. Then they sign it. 

**M: Anything else about this section that could be clarified?**

P: I can’t think of anything.  

P2: I think we’re good 

### Section 8

**M: I’m curious how you deal with the certificates. Can you tell me the story of this process?**

P: That they sign it? 

**M: Yeah. How do you coordinate signatures?**

P: We let them sign it. 

P2:  We fill it out online and have them sign it. We print it off and have them sign it. 

P: Take it. home to the wife

P2:  Yeah, take it home to the spouse. Then we bring it upstairs to debt management. We’re co-located with them. 
 
P: We fax or email them inside the network because you have to get them directly up to them. We sometimes have things we want to hash out with them like payments 

**M: What happens if the spouse isn’t along with them?**

P: We send the form home

**M: Do they mail it in?**

P: P2 gets hers filled out from in field officers. But I’ll have the Vet come right back in. You may not know when or where it went. We normally hand carry them because they’re time sensitive. We also want a paper trail of when we got them into them. We normally don’t leave the Vet to mail it in. The time is usually too sensitive. 

**M: How often does the form get returned?**

P: If the Vet hasn’t signed it… sometimes they get in without our involvement and they send it in without signing it. Normally speaking they don’t return it.
