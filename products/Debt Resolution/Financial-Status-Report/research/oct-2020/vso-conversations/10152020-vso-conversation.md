# VSO Conversation 3
October 15, 2020

## Topline summary
- The VSO we talked to works in an office with 8 other VSOs and hasn’t personally experienced a lot of issues working with DMC or helping Veterans complete the form

- The most challenging aspect is that this office works with a lot of incarcerated Veterans, and oftentimes they work with social workers and it’s difficult to gather their signatures 

    - Mentioned multiple incarcerated Veterans have submitted paperwork to DMC notifying of their incarceration and their documents weren’t processed for months
   which resulted in debt; they submit waivers in that case
   
- Some Veterans have difficulty recalling dates or some assets due to financial distress or mental health complications

- VSOs will tell Veterans to bring in pay stub(s), household bills, and other documentation that will help complete the form 

- Would be helpful to have a list of “other living expenses” (line 21) that DMC expects; VSO mentioned a document that they reference for this section but they were unable to find it during the call 

- Would be helpful to have examples for 14D

- Some utilities are included in rent - they make a note of this in the form

- Instead of completing #36 (Additional info/sheets), they have Veterans submit VA Form 21-4138 

- Some Veterans struggle with the spouse sections if they’re estranged or not in contact with the spouse and can’t find that information or gather a signature

- When completing 16, the VSO will tell the Veteran to put the amount of VA benefits or social security they’re currently receiving rather than gross

    - IE if a Veteran normally receives $1200/mo but benefits are being offset by $800, they will tell the Veteran to put $400
- Hasn’t assisted any Veterans with US savings bonds, boat, camper, or “other assets”

    - The VSO wasn’t sure what “other assets” would be
    
- If Veterans come in for assistance and don’t have access to financial documents, they’re sent home to find those documents and schedule a followup appointment

## Notes

_There isn't a transcript for this session due to not having a dedicated note-taker. Please refer to [the FSR Breakdown Activity board](https://app.mural.co/t/vsa8243/m/vsa8243/1601045280397/5d3484bea26739d32e6b9ce23d425718b4a22498) for notes about the form's sections._

- Generally thinks the form is straightforward
- Hasn't experienced a whole lot of issues with their office completing forms
- Works with 8 VSOs in the regional office 
- One VSO has been working with that form for quite some time
    - Granting waivers that DMC has been reasonable 
- Every form is filled out on a computer and submitted electronically
    - Signature is obtained electronically and submitted straight out of the office 
- Choosing an option for the Veteran depends on the individual person
    - One of the issues they run into is incarcerated Veterans submit to VBA and for 9 months it doesn’t get processed and don’t stop payments which results in a debt 
    - Families drain their accounts and the Veteran doesn’t have any means to pay out 
    - VSO's work with DMC to request a waiver for the amount 
    - DMC has been reasonable granting the waivers overall 
- Most challenging parts of the form:
    - "Sometimes dates or assets aren’t accurate, the ones that are in financial distress, they often are the same individuals that have mental health conditions or aren’t good at controlling money"  
- VSOs will walk Veterans through the form 
- Section 6 is challenging 
- Other living expenses 
    - Might help if there were examples
- USA saving bonds - they don’t have the number for the bonds
