Thank you for joining us today! Today we're going to chat about your experience helping Veterans complete the FSR. We're working on a digitized version of the form, so we're looking to uncover successes and challenges Veterans have while completing their form.

-   Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

-   If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

Start recording.
