# SME Interview 10/6/2020 at 10:00 AM

## Intro questions

**M: Can you tell me about your role?**

P: I used to be a phone agent on the floor. We had people calling in and asking questions if they got their letter, had a debt, had to work out what to do and we can provide them advice and guidance and take waiver/compromise requests. A lot of things you can do with that FSR form. I did that for two years taking calls somewhere between 35-50 calls a day sometimes. So, I got used to this form. I had the same routine depending on what they ask me. No matter what situation there’s only 5 lanes. I would give my spiel about what to do on the form. I was able to get a training position so as new hires come in there’s a 15 week course where we train them on basic systems for phone agents and correspondence workers

**M: You give your spiel. What is it?**

P: Sure! So, the spiel was mostly for the waiver request because it’s the most things you have to do. So when they ask for debt forgiveness I would stand up and grab my ball I toss around and pace the hallways. So, I would say the first thing is to get VA form 5655, sometimes called FSR.  Many names, one form. We know it’s multi-purpose, it’s gonna ask why you’re completing this form. I’d always direct to our website, VA.gov/debtman. It’s on the first page on the right hand side under resources. Halfway down it’ll say FSR. Click on the hyperlink and download to the computer. Download it and save it. If it’s saved in the browser it’s blank. If a blank form is submitted then we have to send a letter. So download and fill out in Adobe. I’d focus on the important parts of the boxes. Box 3 is a really important box. It says specify why you’re completing the form. If you want a waiver, write a waiver. Tell us what you want to do. Otherwise, we have to guess. Section 1 is pretty basic. Personal information. Are you married, have kids, dependents? Is your spouse working? Nothing too difficult there. Box 16 is if you get any VA benefits. Compensation, pension benefits from a GI Bill, social security. Box 17 is total from job and VA benefits. Section 3 is expenses. What comes in every month, what goes out every month, what’s the amount leftover. This is the chunk leftover. We want to work with what’s leftover. Section 4 is gonna be 24a.. what is income minus expenses. 24b, if you have to set up a payment plan what can you set aside. If you can’t pay anything, you can put $0 but even a little bit is good. Section 5 is assets, value of cars, seems intrusive but we want to make sure you don’t have a fleet of expensive cars or a couple mansions. [missed section 7]. Last section is bankruptcy, signature, and if you’re married we need your spouses signature as well. We’ll also need a letter letting us know why you’re requesting a waiver. And any supporting evidence. Police report, etc. Fax, email, post - how would you like to send this to us.

**M: When you’re on the call, you don’t go step-by-step?**

P: Usually I’d give a briefer version of that. Not quite as in depth. If they had questions about like, section 2, then I’d go into more detail. 

**M: What happens after the form is processed?**

P: Once we get it and it’s processed - like if they’re asking for a waiver then the FSR gets sent to the committee of waivers team with any additional documents. If they are asking for a waiver they technically don’t need to submit an FSR. When it comes to compromises and repays, once it’s worked by a staff member then it gets archived. They’re good for up to 6 months so if they get another debt then we can use the same FSR. It’s still searchable. 

**M: What is that resolution look like once it’s in process?**

P: So, they don’t see anything. Basically once we process it they get a letter. They either get an automated letter if we agree with it. If it’s a disagree, we have to manually write a letter and send it out to them. Same thing with waiver requests, once we send it to the committee of waivers we send them a letter that it’s been sent to the committee and to wait for a final decision from them 

**M: What do those manual letters look like?**

P: They’re pre-written paragraphs that we tweak for what we need. There’s an opening and closing that’s always the same. The middle paragraph is usually a pre-written one that we tweak to say, “your payment plan has been denied because we think you can pay more, here’s the amount and when it starts”. Basically filling out dates + numbers 

**M: What does the timeline look like? I’ve heard 30 days from receipt. But if we were to be updating the Veteran with what’s going on with their request, what timelines?**

P: Before COVID, the typical timeline is 30-45 days. That’s the basic rubber stamp answer we give people. Most of the time, even with backlogs, we worked faster than that. That will depend on many things. For example, if they check bankruptcy then that’ll slow things down because we have to send it to that team. Sometimes they’re really quick getting a response within 1-2 days, but sometimes it takes several weeks. So we couldn’t process it before they got a chance to look at it. Typically between 30-45 days. Most of the time it was probably closer to 1-2 weeks. 

## Form Workshop

### Personal info

**M: I’m gonna share my screen and show you the form. We’re gonna go through and talk about where Veterans struggle the most and the most mistakes are made.** 

**M: We got this first section. What’s going on here?**

P: Sure, so the first section is the social security number and file number. Some veterans have a file number. That’s mostly Vietnam-era and before. After that, VA thought it was too confusing so we just use SSN. Nowadays, most of the time folks have social security numbers. We have some leftover file numbers. Sections 1 + 2 can be combined “either or” to look up their debt.

**M: What is the implication for non-Veteran debts here** 

P: For non-Veteran debts if they are personally responsible.. so like… for a lot of folks who have file numbers, their spouse can use their file number to look up their own debt. Usually they can call in with their spouse’s file number and look up their own debts. Or they can use their personal SSN. When it comes to dependents, that’s less the case. Usually they can’t use their parent’s file number because they have nothing to do with it. The dependent has to use their SSN. It’s usually more-so if a Veteran passes away and a debt is created. Any information received about the debt will use the spouse’s file number.

**M: 3 is quite a doozy. We’ve heard this is the most problematic and strangely nuanced section of the form. Can you tell me about the order of operations?**

P: Off the top of my head, the first thing we work are disputes. It’s not even listed in the box. Disputes get worked first, then compromise, then a waiver, and then a payment plan. 

**M: Okay! So what are people putting here? Mistakes?**

P: One of the biggest mistakes is the diff between a dispute and waiver. A waiver is debt forgiveness. All a dispute does is challenging the amount of the debt. We don’t even do that anymore. We end up as a middle man sending it to the team who handles that. Some people write what they want. Compromise, or payment plan, or they’ll circle compromise. Some phone agents and correspondence agents are looking for written stuff. Sometimes they list everything and that can super delay what they’re trying to do. It can effect the waiver request or payment plan. It might not get worked before bad things like collections happen. 

**M: What about this “other”. Do you have context about that?** 

P: That “other”.. I don’t like it. The FSR we use for very specific things. “Other” is really vague. I think for the most part DMC uses the FSR for specific purposes. “Other” is unnecessary and adds more confusion. I can understand asking something for beyond that. But the FSR is usually more specific. You’re sending your personal financial information for a reason - what is that reason? 

**M: You did mention that disputes aren’t on here. Should they be filling this form out for a dispute?**

P: Yes because if you give us this FSR with a dispute, within 30-90 days we can suspend collections. The RO likes the FSR, DMC likes having the FSR on file. So we recommend filling it out for a dispute. 

**M: Anything else about this section?**

P: No, I don’t. Nothing that pops up. It would be nice to make 3 a little more prominent because it’s our jumping off point. A lot of people skip that box accidentally. 

### Section 1

**M: When and how is the phone number used?** 

P: Vets like to send us the phone number - we have slots for work and home. If they call in we’ll get their number that way. We don’t do a lot of outbound calls but it occasionally happens when something was wrong or got screwed up. So the phone agent has to make an outward call. Otherwise, we have to use snail mail. We can’t use email. 

**M: Are there any specific times when something was really screwed up and you had to use the phone?**

P: I was part of the callback team so I did a fair amount of outward calls. But a lot is requesting to speak to a supervisor. Box 6 is just a place where they’ll update us with a new phone number. Same with the address. Sometimes all their personal info has changed. 

**M: Marital status - it’s clear why you’d need to respond with this. Why is the spouse’s name important?**

P: Sure, it probably isn’t super important other than maybe because Vets get married, divorced, and remarried frequently. So they could still be married to someone else. Otherwise, for DMC knowing the name of the spouse isn’t terribly important. 

**M: Ages of other dependents. You ever see errors?**

P: I’ve not. I don’t know why we need to know the ages of the dependents. If they’re a dependent they’re under 18 or an adult with a disability so I was kind of like.. why do we need to know the age. Other than saying a 32 year old isn’t a dependent unless they have a disability. 

**M: The complete employment record. We see there’s two boxes for each. What if someone has a temporary job or more jobs than 2 in the past 2 years. What do they really need?**

P: I don’t feel like we need a complete record. For a lot of folks, a record of the past 2 years is gonna be not enough boxes. We just need to know the current monthly intake and amount left. I feel like current job is all we need. Are you working?  Where’s it at? I feel like 2 years is a bit much. We just need to know if they’re currently working, or unemployed and living off benefits. 

**M: We have name and address of employer. How is that used?**

P: So, as far as name and address… address is probably unnecessary. I don’t know if I’ve ever had to look up a name and address. I know some people do to see where they’re working and seeing if it’s small or huge corporate. Knowing the name and place didn’t seem that important. 

**M: When we’re talking name, are we saying name of the company?**

P: Right, the details of who they’re working under isn’t needed

**M: Anything else about this section?**

P: Uhm, not particularly other than I see some confusion where people don’t know how far back they should go or what information to put there. Complete record is like, “everything??” but the last few months is all we really need to know

### Section 2 

**M: Can you tell me about this section?**

P: One thing I see about this section is it says average monthly income but some people put their yearly income. That can really mess things up. It seems like a fair amount of Veterans are putting their yearly information in there. The self and spouse categories seems alright. One thing I do see them constantly thrown off with is 13 is before payroll deductions, and 14 is after. For retirement, they want to put what they get for VA retirement. Same with social security.  They don’t put from their pay stub, but rather what they receive. That’s something i see constantly

**M: Do they not understand what payroll deductions are or?**

P: Some folks are thrown off, “what do you mean payroll deductions?” I tell them to get their paystub out. Then they see what I’m saying. That’s only related to working and paystub, not government benefits. That seems to help

**M: How does that help you make a decision rather than net take-home pay?**

P: We want to know what they’re living on. Are they working full time and getting compensation? If so, they probably have a good safety net. We can probably work a decent payment plan. That makes me think that it’ll be easier for a 12 month payment plan - what we like to do - over an extended payment plan beyond 12 months.

**M: If they were to just provide 15, would that be satisfactory for processing the form?**

P: Hm, that’s a good question. Honestly I was more interested in 15 because that’s the number I’m looking for. It’s only when I got a weird number in 15 that I wonder if they fill it out right. If they write down monthly gross salary in 13 and the same number in 15 then they forgot to reduce. We’re really looking for the gross after payroll deductions than giving us the itemized list. 

**M: We’re guessing that finding paystubs might be a blocker. Would you agree?**

P: Yeah, people say they may not get a pay stub or can’t access it online. So condensing would be helpful

**M: VA benefits, social security, and other income. This seems like a lot for one section.** 

P: Agreed. I would like to see it broken up a little bit more. A little more clearer. VA benefits - well that’s a broad term! There’s all kind of VA benefits. People will know to put down compensation and pension, but don’t put down GI-Bill because they think it’s something different. They’re getting housing payment, book payments, etc. that needs to be considered. Maybe we can give a list of the common ones. Same with social security or other income. Box 16 is important and sometimes people have to jam stuff in there

**M: Can you tell me about social security being complicated?**

P: Social security is straightforward. You’re getting it or not

**M: Someone brought up that we need to know what they’re getting in VA benefits before deductions. So if they’re getting money taken out**

P: Yup, we need to see their total usual benefit minus deductions. When it comes to VA benefits they write 0, but they actually get $1200 but you’re not getting it because it’s being offset. We can take that into consideration. Having them figure it out is unnecessary because we can see that. We just want to see the total benefit amount without offset

**M: So if they get $1200 and they have a debt taking all that money, would that be found in installment contracts or other debts section?**

P: Sometimes Vets will list their DoD debts, but a lot of times they don’t know it’s being offset. They don’t know what’s going on. Sometimes they list them there, sometimes they don’t. It’s fine if they do list it - but it’s not a big deal if they don’t since we can see all that information 

**M: 13 - 15 are only necessarily if they’re currently employed?**

P: Right. 

**M: Any other income would be in 16?**

P: Right and some Veterans don’t work so they can put N/A boxes 13-15 and write benefits in 16. That’s fairly common

**M: Do you find that Veterans fill this out when they’re not employed?**

P: Yeah sometimes they’ll try if they’re confused. Or they’ll be working an out-of-pocket job for their neighbor and we don’t need to know that.

**M: Anything else in this section?**

P: Nope!

**M: Do know of any other “others” for these payroll deductions?**

P: Child support is fairly common. Sometimes 16 is written there, or it’s under living expenses. I’m trying to think… sometimes folks have life insurance come out of their VA benefit. It’s not a very large amount but I see it there. 

**M: They might put child support in 14d, somewhere else, or both places**

P: We just count it once. It happens a lot with mortgage payments. We basically adjust their math if needed

### Section 3

**M: Can you tell me about this section?**

P: Rent or mortgage is a big one. I tell folks that we look up their address to look up the rough mortgage or rent. If we see they live in the middle of nowhere and they pay $3k we will wonder about that. But if they live in California and their rent is $3k a month then we understand that. We just want their monthly rate. We also have a rough guideline with food. Roughly what it’ll be for X amount of people in the area. If there’s a family of 2 and they spend $1500 a month on groceries… I mean we understand some people have specialized diets. I usually don’t see too many issues with food. I think more often people undercut what they spend on food

**M: Why do you think?**

P:  I don’t know! Sometimes I see a spouse with 4 kids and they spend $150/mo. I just think wow they must be good with coupons!

**M: Utilities and heat?**

P: That’s confusing. It wants multiple things there but it’s 1 box. There should be a utilities section where it lists heat, electricity, internet, water, etc. Some people don’t have a water bill because they have a well. Sometimes people put one utility there and then they have to list them out elsewhere. Living expenses seems to be the catch all for everything. It can be utilities to diapers, child care, etc. 21 becomes a bit catch all. I saw one recently that just listed haircuts

**M: Is that a valid entry?**

P: We debated how valid haircuts are. Do you need a haircut every month? Some people may have skin conditions. Different cultures may be considered. If it’s so important that it’s listed then we’ll consider it. It’s usually not a ton of money, but if you had a $200 haircut every month we aren’t gonna count that

**M: Anything else that goes under. “other living expenses” that may need its own section?**

P:  One thing I see a lot is Netflix/Hulu. We don’t count those. It’s usually not that much money but that’s one of the more common things. I’ve seen. $1200 for Netflix. 

**M: Is cable counted?**

P: Cable is often counted as a utility. Gotta have an entertainment budget, but if it’s really tight then maybe they can go a few months without cable to get it paid off. It’s on the fence. 

**M: 22 obviously is really down here in section 6**

P: I don’t like that. It’s confusing. They fill out section 6 and forget to fill it out. They get to section 6 and get confused. Section 6 and Section 3 could probably be combined 

### Section IV

**M: I hear there’s a lot of mistakes here?**

P: Yeah, sometimes you have to rework their math based on what’s listed. Did they actual total it? Same thing with 24b. They write that they want to pay $50 and then they write $100. I see a lot too that the net monthly income is $120 leftover, but they write $120 again and so we have to take that. Whatever is written in 24b is the lowest that can be considered. If they offer $500 and they can’t afford that, we’re in a tight spot. They said they could spend $500 even though the math says they probably can’t. Then they have to call and we have to work to adjust it 

**M: I’ve heard that people put their compromise offers in here**

P: Right! Yeah, 24B is just for payment plans. Regular recurrent payment plans. I feel like if they’re asking for a compromise offer that should be a separate box. There’s a due process waiver means they got it to us within a certain time limit that we can suspend collections. So they won’t have to pay while we wait for it to be processed. Regular means they got it to us within 180 days but because they weren’t super timely then they’re put on a payment plan. People who get it submitted in a timely manner can write $0. There are some correspondence that they see the amount they want to pay but they could have suspended t and they just put them on a payment plan

**M:  But they’ll get the money back if the waiver is approved?**

P: Yup, as long as they don’t have another debt. If they do, we move the money over to that debt

**M: If they do select compromise at the beginning, where are they supposed to write the offer?**

P: I’ve heard two diff places: 24b and write “comp offer” and the number. Or they’ll write it in box 3 and write “compromise - $xx.xx”

**M: Anything else in this section? Any particular strategies for deciding this amount?**

P: What they’re gonna pay?

**M: Yeah**

P: What I used to do is I had a cheat sheet that would do my calculations for me. I’d put in their total debt, check if they have an FSR - so they can do 12 months or up to 3 year - I’d look offsets, refund as well, and then I’d crosscheck the amount put and see if the payment plan fits within the 3 years. Otherwise I have to bring it to my supervisor and then I have to put whatever they decide. I try to put what they say unless I think it would be better for them to pay a little bit more. 

**M: Any sort of guidance we can provide for the amount Veterans could pay to help them make a reasonable but comfortable offer?**

P: One of the mantras is, “They should treat the DMC debt like any other bill”.  We should be treated equally. We’re gonna work with you, but we should be treated as equal to any other bill. I know it stinks, but we’re just another bill. Where can we fit in so we don’t disrupt? 

**M: Anything else about this section?**

P: Nope!

### Section V 

P: It’s either filled out or not filled out. Usually they’re good about the cars. 27 is pretty much always filled out. We just need to know if they bought a brand new sports car then they can probably pay more. Cash on hand… I don’t understand the purpose of that box. How can we verify that? And who cares? Cash in the bank makes more sense. People are shooting for a low payment plan for have $250k in the bank. Obviously most Vets don’t have anywhere near that amount of money. Same thing with bonds, stocks, it’s pretty rare but occasionally there’s stuff there. It’s usually pretty basic, though. They either have it or they don’t. 

**M: Cash in bank - building and loan account?** 

P: I’ve never been able to get an answer on that! What is a building account? I don’t know if it’s business accounts… but you can’t use a business account to pay a personal debt. 

**M: Nobody’s known! Other assets - everything put in here is counted against them. I have to assume that a lot of time people don’t put much here?**

P: I would see almost nothing there. Very rarely would I see other assets. Some people own their own business and have stuff there, other properties, but almost always 32 is blank. Yeah, they’re not gonna offer themselves up if they have money stored there. 

**M: Besides checking and savings, cash in bank, it says “etc.”. Do you know what that might be?**

P: I don’t… I would think checking and savings would cover pretty much any money you have in the bank 

**M: For these figures - how exact do you expect?**

P: Not super exact. Give us your rough estimate. If you have an older vehicle you won’t get a lot of money back. We’re just looking for eyebrow raisers. We won’t ask to sell cars to pay a debt.

**M: For cash in bank - if they have $1200 but they actually have $1250, does that matter?**

P: No. Again, I don’t even know if we have a way to verify their money in the bank. It’s mostly to check if they have a lot in there. We’re just looking for eyebrow raisers. Folks get their VA benefits wrong all the time and we verify it. 

**M: Anything else in this section?**

P: Nope

### Section VI 

**M: This one is related to expenses. What are your thoughts?**

P: I don’t like this section. I don’t like that is says “Installment contracts and other debts”. Living expenses to me is bills you need to live. Things that are an absolute must. This is everything else. Education loans,  medical bills, credit cards.  Anything outside of a utility or needed to live, but important to pay off. That’s where this needs to go. There is so much  unneeded request for info. A lot of times addresses aren’t put on here and that’s fine. Date and purpose can be good to know how old it is. Original amount of the debt.. I don’t get how that’s super pertinent. We just need to know if they’re still paying it. Unpaid balance is okay in case we can see that they’ll be done paying it in a few months. Amount past due - I’ve never needed to know that information 

**M: Why do you think it’s on here?**

P: I guess to see if they’ve been keeping up with stuff. If they send us a letter, they’ll let us know if they’re passed due on bills. I don’t really need to know the amount. 

**M: So they fill it out, do the totals, go across to E, then put it up in 22?**  

P: Right, they don’t get what 22 is and skip it. So they calculate it and get to section 6 and are like, “oh crap” and they skip it because they’re frustrated or they fill it out and forget to update the other section. 

**M: Anything else in this section?**

P: Nope, I think I’ve covered my qualms with it

### Section VII

**M: So this bankrupt thing is important. Tell me more**

P: Yeah, so I think this could just be called “bankruptcy information” instead of “Additional data”. We have to ask if they’ve been adjudicated for bankruptcy. If they select yes then we can’t work on it. Even if they write they were discharged in 1979, it has to be reviewed by the bankruptcy team before we can work on it. It drives that team bonkers, but they get it. They get into the system and check to see if it’s ongoing. If it’s not, then they’ll put it back into the working queue and leave a note on the file and in the account that bankruptcy was discharged on this day. If it’s not been adjudicated then they’ll give us information and put it into a bankruptcy status. Otherwise, they’ll let us know a judge’s allowed payments. Nowadays they get back to us within 2 days because they’re all caught up

**M: How often is this filled out?**

P: Yes and no usually is. Sometimes the date of discharge isn’t because it was so long ago. For the most part, there’s usually a separate letter explaining in detail what they want 

**M: Up here it says “if you have been adjudicated please send pertinent documentation”. Do you know anything about that?**

P: Sometimes it is attached, but most of the time if they’re already in bankruptcy we know. We’ll get into the account and see if it’s the bankruptcy status and they’ll be told we shouldn’t be collecting. So they check yes that they have an older bankruptcy. 

**M: What is the pertinent documentation?**

P: Either the discharge court document or some other letter from the court that collections may continue. Some sort of court docket. 

**M: So 36 is too small? You find that people glaze over it and write a letter?**

P: Yup, sometimes you see stuff jammed in there or they’ll leave it blank/write “see attached letter”. 

**M: Anything else about this section?**

P: Nope

### Section VIII

**M:  So they have to sign it. Can you tell me mistakes?**

P: So the date signed is important. If it’s not signed we have to send a letter requesting a new one. Can be digital or handwritten. No issue either way. The mistake I see is the spouse not signing it. I’ve had people argue that they have separate bank accounts, I understand but according to the US government they are a combined unit. It’s probably the biggest mistake besides not signing it. 

**M: So you said digital signatures are allowed?**

P: Yeah,  those are pretty rare. Even if it’s typed out it’s mostly hand signed. Sometimes they’ll try to drag their mouse over it. I’ve been told by supervisors that it’s fine. Once in a while people have a digital signature with Adobe. That’s rare though. 90% are physically signed 

**M: Do you ever see people just type their name?**

P: Nope, can’t think of a time I’ve seen a name typed. People do usually try to sign it

**M: Would those be accepted?**

P: I don’t think so. I think typing your name probably isn’t valid. 

**M: Do you find that 37B or 38B are the same date?**

P: Typically, yeah. They probably do what a lot of spouses do and sign for them. I’m not typically concerned about that. Occasionally it’ll be a different date. 

**M: Any cases where a signature of a spouse isn’t required because they’re unable?**

P: Usually in the case of a POA. It’ll say signature of the applicant and the Veteran can’t write anymore. Then POA signature is fine. 

**M: Anything else about this section?**

P: Nope

**M: Anything else broadly about the form?**

P:  Because it’s two pages I wish we had more consistency.  If it’s double-sided people don’t fill out both sides, but if it’s two separate pages then we’ll get one page but not the other.
