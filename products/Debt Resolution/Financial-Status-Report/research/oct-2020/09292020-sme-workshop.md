FSR SME Workshop - 09/29/2020
====================================
Rebecca Walsh & Riley Orr

## Intro questions

**Can you tell me a little bit about your roles?**

W: Basically it’s a doc from the Veterans. If we request a long payment plan, waivers, payment plans, things along those lines. 

**Moderator: How many calls are about FSR?**

A: Fairly often. Every other day. I think people would do it more if they think they could. They don’t ask or think they can’t
  
W: It can be pretty lengthy
  
T: We can’t quantify it. Some of our people refer them to the VSOs for assistance because they can give a little more in-depth attention for something like that.
  
**Moderator: I didn’t know they referred to a VSO. Are there cases where you do walk a Veteran through the form?**

W: I’m sure it does happen. But our agents refer them to a VSO

T: There’s a concern of conflict of interest as well. If we help them fill the form out and they don’t get what they want, then it can be concerning.

**Moderator: So they’ll say you didn’t help me fill it out the right way?**

T: Yeah, or not mentioning a debt to put

**Moderator: What are questions you receive?**

A: What do I write in box 3? How to do the math in 24a and b?

W: It comes up quite a bit where we get an FSR and they don’t put on everything relevant

**Moderator: What happens?**

W: They have to submit a brand new FSR. If there’s some way to save it so they can resubmit it, that would be helpful. 

**Moderator: How do they find out their mistake when filling it out?**

W: By talking to an agent. They’ll get a letter in the mail. They’ll call in about a payment and say they can’t afford that, and hopefully it comes up that they didn’t include everything and they send in a new one. But the FSR is taken for face value. We don’t go to IRS to double-check things. 

**Moderator: How often do you have to introduce Veterans to the FSR once they’ve called in?**

W: Pretty much every debt collection letter has a letter

A: It comes up in almost every phone call as well

**Moderator: And what was their reaction?**

W: I gotta fill out the whole thing - both sides??

T: Do I have to include my spouse and all the people living with me?

**Moderator: Do they have negative reactions to that?**

A + W: Some

**Moderator; Do you know why?**

W: Because they’re the ones getting the benefits and it has nothing to do with the spouse

A: It’s a VA made a mistake, so why does the VA need to know my information? I hear that I a lot

**Moderator: So they’re frustrated about the reason for the debt and now they’re frustrated**

A: I’m saying you made a mistake, so why is my financial situation coming into play?

**Moderator: So sending in an FSR**

T: Some people ask if they need to send in supporting documents to prove if what they’re putting down is correct. We typically don’t require that.

**Moderator: It could be asked in the future?**

T: It’s not very common. If it was a situation if something was really out there. I don’t know of an example.

W: We take it for face value. I live in Minnesota and my gas expenses are cheaper than in another state

A: I think I was just saying the only time I’ve seen supporting documentation asked for is if someone sends in an FSR, they send in a second one, a third one, and a fourth one and it changes in a one month period. In that case I’ve seen people say they need extra information. Other than an extreme case like that I’ve never seen supporting docs requests

W: There’s no limit on how many FSRs they can submit

**Moderator: What are some of the. most common mistakes when filling out the form?**

W: Box 3 not filled out. On the phones we have the luxury of speaking to the Veteran. If the Veteran isn’t requesting a repayment plan, they can’t just do one

A: 24 a and b

W: Is it 24a where it shows how much money they have left over? That’s kinda the amount we used, and if the math isn’t double-checked they’re gonna be submitted for a payment plan they can’t afford

**Moderator: Is it common that the math is done wrong?**

Multiple people: Yes

A: The way it works is weird because math from page two is brought back to the first page, so you’d think the total would be on page 2 even though it’s on page one.

**Moderator: The nice thing about putting it online is they won’t have to do any math**

T: Yeah, a lot of them forget about education benefits and they forget to put it on the sheet

W: Most importantly is if they don’t sign it, it’s almost like they don’t have it. If there’s a requirement to sign before submitting, that would be ideal 

## FSR Mural board 	

**Moderator: I believe that social security numbers are attached to all veteran profiles. Am I wrong?**

Leah: You’re correct, that’s pre-filled from the Vets API 

W: But we’ll get it with the full social? It won’t be good to us without

**Moderator: I did read that this file number is their social security number. Is it not? Do they know this number?**

A:  Most will know it

W: It depends when they start getting benefits, the benefit they’re getting, sometimes they’re getting their parents’ benefits. Those two numbers can be different. When it’s not their file number, but it’s their parents, they do typically know that

A: Unless it’s a dependent, they usually know their file number. Dependents sometimes don’t. Is that a safe statement Billy?

W: Yeah

**Moderator: So if it’s a dependent debt, the file number will be their parents’ file number?**

W: Yeah. If we have their full social we can find everything we need.

**Moderator: So file number isn’t necessary?**

A + W: It’s not necessary, but nice to have as long as we have SSN 

T: Will we have to get permission to not include that?

A: That’s my question too

T: That’s not a DMC form

**Moderator: People can send in this form all they want without sending in a file number, right?**

W: We get blank ones all the time

**Moderator: I’ll make a note to ask if we can omit this or make it optional**

**Moderator: When it comes to section 3, specify why you’re completing this form, this is probably one of the biggest spots. What are common things you’ve seen Veterans write?**

W: Dispute even though they don’t need this form for a dispute. Or put all of the above, or put nothing. They want a waiver, compromise, or payment plan

A: A lot of them don’t understand the difference between a waiver, compromise, or payment plan. Maybe include a definition. That might help. 

**Moderator: When they’re looking to put something “other”, is there anything that’s a legitimate entry? Is there an “other” that’s an actual option?**

W: Maybe refund?

A:  Or removal from CAVRES, 

T: Overseas active duty

W: Suspension of debt should be an option on there

**Moderator: Suspension of debt, refund request,**

A: Removal from credit report, cross servicing, treasury…

W: Those aren’t required on this form

A: I’m just saying things I’ve seen

W: You can’t be held to just one of the options

**Moderator: So you can request both a waiver and a refund because you’ve already paid out from your benefits a couple times?**

W: Right, and a refund can’t be issues 

A: Waiver, payment plan, refund are the most common ones I’ve seen

**Moderator: This isn’t a legitimate way to go about it, right?**

A: Unless it’s a 90 day timely waiver, they’ll have to make payments and then they’ll get the refund

T: It’s a 30 day for education

A: Right, education hasn’t changed yet

**Moderator:  What does an ideal response look like?**

W: If they say “Waiver or payment plan”, etc. basically any combination

**Moderator: You just want them to select something, you don’t need a narrative?**

W: We encourage them to write a letter to explain the situation to give more context about their financial situation. it can only help with their decision

T: Are you inquiring if there’s a fill in the blank?

**Moderator: Yeah because it looks like you should be writing a lot of stuff here. I’m starting to see that this isn’t free-form rather than select (checkboxes)**

**Moderator: What are some mistakes made?**

W: Blank

A: Or not understanding what they’re asking for. Compromise instead of a payment plan, payment plan instead of a compromise

W: We need them to say waiver to get a waiver. We need to see “waiver”

**Moderator: So how important is it that they say what they want rather than being guided to the right option for their situation?**

A: I think you can make it a dropdown box 

W: And make it a requirement

**Moderator: Does anything they select change any required information for the rest of the form?**

T:  If they requested waiver or compromise, they should submit a letter. If they have multiple debts we need to know which one

**Moderator: What format are the letters received?**

A + W: Email, fax

**Moderator: And that’s along with the filled out FSR? Typed or written?**

W: There’s a spot on the back with freeform text. Sometimes they send a letter with this form

A: Maybe on the website you could add a supporting doc button where they could attach their letter to the FSR

**Moderator: Does it need to be a document?**

A: No 

T: Sometimes they write something and attach a JPEG, sometimes it’s a PDF, we get a lot of different submissions

**Moderator: Do you have a preference?**

A + W: We prefer PDF

**Moderator: Does handwritten letters seem to be a large number of the submissions? If it’s not filled in on the form by hand, are they writing separate letters by hand?**

W: That happens. If we received this form and number 3 was blank but there’s a letter that says waiver, or waiver is anywhere else on the form we accept that

T: Sometimes handwritten is more convenient. Sometimes they don’t have the option to go to a computer without setting an appointment. I think we do need the option for something handwritten. Obviously they’re using something to do this so they’re on something, but sometimes people are prepared with handwritten things. 

W: They could be visiting their VSO and they have the letter with them and they want to scan it in 

T: I don’t know how important it is if the VSO types something other than the Veteran submitting handwritten, if the VSO types the letter, if that’s accepted 
	
### Addresses

**Moderator: Are addresses updated in the Veterans record on your side?**

W: Ideally they should be. If a Veteran submits something with a new address change and we don’t change it, that’s a DMC error.

A: All of this information gets updated in the system where eligible like if we have a different birth date, address, phone number

**Moderator: Where is it updated**

W + T: Our case management system. 

**Moderator: When and how do you use the telephone number?**

W: It should be entered, but we’ll get asked to contact the Vet so if they don’t fill it out we can’t call them

**Moderator: When would you call?**

W: Call a Vet back. For example, if they didn’t fill out box 3. Or if we’re processing something and need to notify the Vet. Just to contact the Vet if we need to

**Moderator: Are there rules about contacting the Vet?**

W: No, but typically it’d be phone unit and not correspondence team. We aren’t open late enough for solicitors to not be contacting people. We try to be aware about where in the country the Veteran is

**Moderator: Why is the name of the Veteran’s spouse needed?**

T: Household income is what we base hardship on

**Moderator: And you need their name for that?**

T: Right, their name, expenses, household expenses.

W: If the vet’s paying $900 for food a month and there’s no spouse or dependents, then that’s different than if there’s a spouse and 4 children listed

**Moderator: Right, I just didn’t know if the actual name needed to be provided if they check off married**

W: I would think same format as Veteran name

T: Not many people put their middle name

**Moderator: What does the “ages” of dependents mean in context?**

A: Like, if they put diapers but their kids are 10… I’m not sure why we have it 

W: It’s more “gotcha”. It’s hard to to take each box into context. We look at everything and try to piece it together. We look at dependents and then look at the expenses to see if they line up. We refer to the IRS guidelines for how much expenses on average

A: That’s kind of what I’ve seen it used for. 

**Moderator: Just a little more context sort of question?**

W: Exactly

### Complete record of employment

**Moderator: If these financial details are being given, why are employee records pertinent if financial details are being given?**

W: Context. The Veteran could say he’s a doctor, a grocery store clerk, we would not know. We just ask for as much info as possible for context to make a decision on the payment plan that will work on both sides

T: Cal-C uses it for waiver request or denial

**Moderator: So does it matter if you write McDonalds vs…**

W: Fast food cashier?

**Moderator:  Yeah, we’re trying to make sense of this**

A: This is the least important part of the form in my opinion

**Moderator: What if a Veteran or their spouse has had more than 2 jobs in the past two years?**

W: Mostly we just want to know if you’re currently working or not, and for how long you haven’t been working

**Moderator: Do Veterans ever include more than two jobs?**

W + A: Yeah, but we never ask for it. We never ask for pay stubs or anything like that

**Moderator: What if they have more than one job?**

A: They add an attachment

**Moderator: Temp jobs?**

A: They just fill it out the best they can. Maybe a little plus button to add more

**Moderator: Do we even care?**

A: Not really. We just need to know,  like Billy said, if they’re working or not working now. So if they work as a doctor but they make $20k/yr, that might need more information. 

W: If they left it blank, I would still keep going

A: The next section is what I focus on more

W: Yup

**Moderator: What happens with the present time here if they aren’t working?**

W: They cross i t out and write that they’re not working. It’d be nice to switch that field to a previous date. Otherwise they can only fill out the second line. Sometimes they’ll cross out the first line and write the previous job underneath

**Moderator: What’s the ideal entry?**

A: People put cashier, banker, financial specialist, janitor. It’s generic in my experience (Job type)

W: Yeah, and then we see the salary and make a decision

**Moderator: What is “Name”? Name of the business, manager?**

W: Debt Management Center, 1 Federal Drive

**Moderator: How specific?**

A: They can leave it blank

W: I would never look that up or anything

A: It’s blank on half the forms I think

T: I think business name and city/state is probably the most we’d ever really care about
	
### Section 2

**Moderator: Are there any ways this section can vary for non-salaried employees?**

W: I guess they’d list their hourly or something

A: We want what they make a month on average, so they’ll take their paycheck and double it. 

T: One of those hover boxes to explain that would be helpful

A: Or have a calculator that asks them if they work hourly or whatever and have it calculate for them

**Moderator: What about freelancer?**

A + W: Best estimate
	
**Moderator: What sort of accounts for payroll deductions?**

W: Medical, everything

A: Section 14 a b c and d, I cannot count the number of times people think they need to put their retirement income and social security income. It’s the most common mistake. They put their social security income in box c, and their retirement income in box b. 

**Moderator: Does that effect the form negatively in the decision?**

W: More than likely they may also put it under 16 and then we’re giving them a worse payment plan than they can afford. Or someone on our time has to recalculate 

A: Yeah, find what they’re actually getting for social security

**Moderator: does this include employee sponsored and personal retirement?** 

T: If it comes out of your paycheck

A: Sometimes we only see them do box 13 and 14e and sometimes that gets accepted. Just total payroll deductions might be easier to do and skip the rest

T: What if they have payroll deductions to pay for something and then they’re double-checking (didn’t quite get all this)

**Moderator: What other deductions are common?**

A: TOP from their check, some weird program from their work where they’re putting more money away for something 

**Moderator: Do they ever make any mistake s in this “other” section?**

A + W: Oh yeah. 

A:  They put income instead of deductions because they think they’re all income. That’s the biggest mistake I see on the form

**Moderator: Where would veterans be able to find the info for 16?**

W: Their benefits portal, social security, social security check. It would be nice if this was split into diff boxes to say their social security is this, benefits is that

**Moderator: What are examples of “other” incomes**

W + A: Retirements, another job, child support receiving, annuities, state benefits, programs

**Moderator: So it would be beneficial to break these up into multiple entries?**

A: If 16 could add a line, they could type in social security, click it again, 

T: I rent a room to someone and they pay rent

**Moderator: If they have another job, what happens with all of this stuff?**

W: They put their net and not their gross down there

A: I think that section causes more issues.

W: If they put their gross instead of net then we’re gonna be overcharging them. 

A: It should be Net. I think the whole form should be Net. 

W: It would be a lot iasier

A: Monthly net from VA, monthly net from social security. I don’t know if we can change the form 

**Moderator: There might be ways to design it so entering these things isn’t so difficult. Like, telling them where to go to get something.** 

**Moderator: Do Veterans have to specify the source for VA benefits or SS incomes?**

W: Would be nice if they were separated out. If they aren’t working and they’re getting social security and benefits, it’s lumped. 

A: Would make it easier if it’s split up 

W: Sometimes we have to guess where they get the lump sum from

**Moderator: Is VA benefits specific enough for you all?**


W: Well, so education benefits are short-term and compensation are long-term, so that may make a change in the decision.  I say may, but y’know.

**Moderator: Any other comments about this section?**

A: Making sure they do the math right in box 17. As long as it’s automated then that’s good. Box 17 is messed up a lot 

W: Yup

**Moderator: I think we’ll be able to get around that issue.**
	
### Section 3

**Moderator: For rent or mortgage payment, does it include all costs?**

W: It should, but it doesn’t specify 

**Moderator: Are there any other specific rent scenarios that might impact the determination?** 

W: We don’t go that deep. If they said $700/mo for rent, we accept it

**Moderator: For food, does this include groceries or eating out?**

W: Not that finicky

**Moderator: Are there guidelines we should provide?**

A: The IRS has guidelines

W: I’ll drop it in the chat. If someone has diabetes, they need a special diet. 

**Moderator: Are these specific utilities expected or does it go to cable, trash, etc?**

W: It’s whatever they want to do. Write it all or split it in 21

T: Most people use gas, electricity, etc. And then in 21 it’s cable, internet, insurance, medicine. We see a lot of detailing in 21

A: Some that we don’t accept… a lot of people write “(I missed it??)”

A: This is where it takes numbers from page 2 and brings it back to page 1

W: We’ll see their mortgage listed on here a lot too and it’s listed twice

**Moderator: So, for other living expenses.. what other kinds of expenses go here?**

W: Maid service, lawn people, veterinary service

T: Massages, hair, entertainment

**Moderator: Do they count?**

W: Depends on how reasonable they are. 

T: If someone’s claiming hardship and they’re getting hair done, massages, facials, a lot of it isn’t medically warranted so it speaks to hardship 

W: On their end too though if they’re a live-in nurse that’s something that would help them

T: Some people have support animals, child support

W: The back is strictly for a loan. If I as filling this out I’d be putting cable and subscriptions for 21. Car insurance under 21 as well

**Moderator: These are actual credit lines. What you’re wanting here**

W: 21 or the other page?

**Moderator: 22**

W: 22 in my opinion should be stuff like that

A: Credit cards, bank debts, loans. Like, I need shampoo and cleaning supplies, gas for my cars is $50 a month, car insurance could go on 22 really if you wanted to. The things you have to buy each month for the household. Clothing. You can estimate your clothing cost for the year. 

**Moderator: Your cell phone bill is an installment contract, but it’s also a utility and it’s also a living expense, so**

W: It would be easier if 22 was asked before 21

A: Yeah

**Moderator: So anything that doesn’t fit into this category goes into the other category?**

W: Yeah
	
### Section IV

A: I think section 4 is the most important on the whole form 

**Moderator: Do Veterans request assistance determining a comfortable payment amount? If they’ve done all their math and put in this final figure, do they ever request that they want guidance or do they put down whatever?** 

W: 24B we will never go lower than what they put in there

A: Many put 0, but they can’t. They try

**Moderator: What if they put 1?**

A: The minimum in some situations is $25

T: For this it’s probably $50

A: Every once in a while you see $25 for a $100 debt

A: 1/3 and 2/3 of 25a should be 24b 

W: We’re gonna look at these two boxes together to make a determination 

**Moderator: Is there anything wrong with a suggestion?**

W: We tried to come up with an equation, and the best we came up with covered 80% of the debts. We tried. If you could come up with one that would be brilliant!

**Moderator: Hah, yeah I’m just wondering if you want 1/3 to 2/3 of that discretionary income we could have a suggested, but they can put in whatever they want**

T: I don’t think we can lead them

A: Yeah, if someone’s discretionary income is $200 but they owe $1000… just put the amount they want their monthly payments to be if they have to make payments. That’s the question we want them to answer

W: I agree. It’s what you can live with

T: If it’s a timely waiver within 30-60, if they request a waiver and we’re putting it under suspension they wouldn’t have to include it

A: I think they should include it anyway

T: Right, then we could process it faster. It’s gonna be nice not having to interpret people’s handwriting 

**Moderator: Anything else about this section?**

W: 24a gets filled out wrong quite a bit. So a calculator would be helpful. 

### Section 5

**Moderator: What is the “etc” in 25?**

W: *Laughs* Whatever!

T:  Under your mattress

W: That would be 26

T: Oh, true!

**Moderator: What’s a “building and loan accounts”**

(No one seemed to know?)

T: Their bitcoin account *laugh*

W: Whatever is easily accessible

**Moderator: How exact should these figures be?**

W: Not, but if they have $10k in their bank acc and they owe $1k we’re gonna be less lenient with a payment plan

A: I’m okay to rounding even to the thousand or some cases the ten thousand mark

**Moderator: Maybe there’s some verbiage we can use**

W: I’d put what’s in my account today. We’re not digging in too deep

A: It only hurts them really

T: If they got an $80k award action, but they spent it on a house, it’d be an asset

**Moderator: Veterans would never be able to provide a proof of balance?**

W: I won’t say we won’t ever ask for it, but we don’t ask for it

**Moderator: Liquid? Anything they can grab without going to a bank?**

W: Right

**Moderator: How should Veterans determine value of their cars?**

T: Blue book

W: Rough guess. We can joke “you have 3 BMWs” but it’s not like they can flip them

A: Round to ten thousand again for this whole section. Round to at least $8k 

**Moderator: Any ways we can recommend? Recommend Kelly Blue Book? Might be a question for someone on the…**

W: I’d probably just throw best estimate. It’s just for context

**Moderator: Stocks and other bonds. What are “other bonds”?**

W: Notes, I dunno

**Moderator: Other assets..  what are some examples of other assets you’d expect to be included?** 

W: In home

**Moderator:  In home?**

W: Second home. Vacation home.

**Moderator: Alrighty. What are some examples of things Veterans include that they don’t need to?**

T: I think a lot of people put their retirement accounts. We typically wouldn’t ask someone to cash out their retirement. A lot of people probably do notate what they have saved for retirement

**Moderator: So you’re saying that’s not something you ask them to act on. is that something we should specify? That we don’t want to know what their retirement accounts are? What should be going here?**

W: So ideally the thought is that. we’re gonna see what kind of assets they have and ask them to sell it… but we’ve never done that. It’s just context for us to see their financial situation and the committee to make a call 

T: People might put jewelry or fine art. Probably more luxury possessions.  Things they received as gifts, not necessarily things they can afford to buy

A: Not all of this form is relevant to what we do

T: Other people use the form, not just us

**Moderator: Anything else about this section?**

A: Not really

### Section 6

A: Hmmmm this one

**Moderator: Name and address of creditor. What constitutes an acceptable creditor name?** 

W: If you put PayPal, I’m happy

**Moderator: But if I put Synchrony?** 

W: We’re happy. We just want to have context about what they have out there for debts	Moderator: We’re just trying to communicate what we want out of this section. If I put my furniture on a payment plan, just want to tea out the question mark about if I should be talking about the appliance store or the person backing the loan

W: If they listed just “furniture” I’d be fine with that

A: I think the next 5 are the most important ones 

**Moderator: Are individuals appropriate?**

W: See it all the time

T: If it’s a legitimate debt that they pay then we trust 

**Moderator: How necessary are creditor addresses?** 

W: Not for our purposes 

**Moderator: VS whose?**

W: Someone else using the form. We’re just happy seeing “Visa for $1000 paying $100 a month”

**Moderator: What sort of info do you expect for purpose of debt?**

T: Vacation home, furniture, etc.

W: We really don’t care

**Moderator:  Original amount?**

T: It’s going to be hard if it’s fluctuating 

A: I’d be fine with rounding

W: It could be all over the board every month

T: If it shows they’ve paid a significant amount 

**Moderator: How would you have an original amount?**

T: Student loan maybe, but credit card maybe not

**Moderator: How exact does “unpaid balance” need to be?**

T: Ballpark

A: As close as it can

**Moderator: Anymore comments?**

W: In “F” is the same as “D”. There’s confusion.

A:  I would say bold 34I. because that’s the important one. 

**Moderator: That should be calculated** 

W: And then that would go under 22A

A: Could you make the online form look totally different?

**Moderator: That’s exactly what’s gonna happen. It’ll be like turbo tax rather than a paper form**

T: So they’re gonna list it and it’s magically gonna add

W: That would be nice!

**Moderator: We just have to understand how this form works so we’re not making assumptions** 
	
### Section VII

**Moderator: What does that “pertinent documentation” mean?**

W: We don’t need any documentation because we can look it up. We’re just covering our butts with any liabilities. So basically if they check that box, whatever request they’re asking for we’re going to hard stop and the debt is going to be looked at and a council will see if we can collect on this debt or not. Even if it’s from 20 years ago, it’ll go through that same process 

**Moderator: What does the pertinent documentation mean?**

W: Basically all we need is the court ID number. Like I said, we’ll just throw in their social and find it. This just flags it

A: This is the one part of the whole form that we do verify every single time

**Moderator: Is it often yes?** 

A: I mean, often enough. It’s a common occurrence. There are people who just do bankruptcy 

**Moderator: Location of course. State, city?** 

A: All they need to do is check yes. The more they put the easier it is. 

**Moderator: For you all?**

A: Yeah

W: We can just pull that information up 

**Moderator: Is that done regardless?**

A + W: If they check yes 

**Moderator: So like, this docket number. How often is that filled in?**

W: Couldn’t answer that

T:  It’s on all their paperwork 

**Moderator: It comes down to whether or not they check yes. Let’s imagine they say yes. Now they’re asked all these questions. Whether or not they fill it in doesn’t really matter?**

W:  The yes if the important part, but we can find everything else. If they provide the information, we verify it anyway

**Moderator: How does it make it easier?**

T: We’re not the bankruptcy team, so we wouldn’t know

**Moderator: The last section we need to talk about is this space and additional sheets. What’s commonly going here?**

W: I’m requesting a waiver because blah, blah, blah. When they submit a new FSR, they explain why it’s different rather than putting in different dollar amounts. 

**Moderator: There are several parts that say you can write more information in this section. Which areas are they coming from to fill in this section?**

W: Nothing leads them there. If they see that spot they can expand 

**Moderator: How long are the responses?**

W: Short cuz there’s not enough room 

**Moderator: Generally it’s the same information going in here as the letter?**

W: Yes

**Moderator: Any other thoughts?**

A: Not really
