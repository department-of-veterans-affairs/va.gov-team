# Goals

* Create a digital experience that guides Veterans through requesting financial assistance or resolution for their debt(s). 

# Background

There are multiple resolution pathways a Veteran can select when resolving their benefit debt, including: requesting an extended payment plan, submitting a compromise offer, or asking for a waiver. All of these options require the submission of a Financial Status Report (VA Form 5655), which captures a monthly snapshot of the Veteran's household income and expenses. Veterans often struggle to include all the information needed to accurately represent their financial situation, including duplicating information. 

# User Research Goal

The goal of this research is to expose the new Financial Status Report design in order to capture and record user behaviors and pain points. With this research, we'd like to find high level problems to do further exploration and redesign work on a smaller scale.

# Hypotheses Tested 

* Veterans will be able to identify and select which debt(s) they want to request financial help for, but they may struggle to select a resolution option
* Veterans might not know their spouse's employment history or complete monthly financial snapshot
* Veterans may feel overwhelmed when they begin inputting household expenses and assets, but may find the task easier when they see the predetermined list of input types
* Veterans may be concerned about supplying information for assets such as vehicles
* Veterans may want to print a copy of their submitted application for their records
* Veterans will likely not know all their financial information, such as payroll deductions, without needing to search their personal records
* Veterans may be interested in next steps following their application submission and when they can expect a decision from DMC
* Veterans may be interested in updating their submitted FSR if their financial situation changes or they forgot to include an asset

# Research Method: 

Guided Interview & Task-based Usability Test 

Remote, moderated Zoom calls with Veterans 

# Who We Spoke With

* 10 total participants (5 male, 3 female, 1 non-binary, 1 preferred not to say; ages from 25 to 75 or older)
  * 9 have received medical copay bills
    * A couple of these participants had received medical copay bills during COVID and weren't aware that collection was on hold
  * 4 have experience with education debt
    * 1 had a dependent education debt
* Participants had a range of disability ratings from 0-100%
* 8 were from major metro areas while 2 were from rural or remote areas
* Technology used during the session:
  * 4 were on PC
  * 4 were on tablet
  * 1 was on mobile (Android)
  * 1 experienced technical difficulties so the moderator screen shared

# Research Questions

Introduction page:

* Do Veterans understand the available repayment options?
* Do Veterans read the subway map steps to learn about what information they'll need to submit the form, or do they skip over that information?
  * If Veterans read the subway map steps, what do they think about needing to require all that information?

Form:

* Are Veterans able to easily complete each section of the form?
* Would Veterans be able to easily provide their spouse's employment and income information?
* Is it clear to Veterans why they need to provide their financial information?
* Do Veterans understand each resolution option and the impact each one has on the form's processing order?
* What do Veterans expect to do if they need to submit the form with revisions?
* Are Veterans able to easily use the new list loop component?

After submission:

* What do Veterans expect to do after they've submitted their request? (Print?)
* What communications do Veterans expect to receive about their request?

# Findings

### Introduction page

#### Do Veterans understand the available repayment options?

Generally yes, aside from a few misinterpretations. Of ten participants:

* Three participants were under the impression that their entire monthly entitlement would be reduced until the full debt was repaid
* Two participants didn't understand the difference between monthly offsets and payments
* One participant interpreted 'Compromise offer' to mean forbearance / pay it later

#### Do Veterans read the subway map steps to learn about what information they'll need to submit the form, or do they skip over that information? 

Sometimes;

* Most participants said they would sign in upon seeing the sign in alert, without scrolling further down the page.
* Several participants didn't notice the content below the sign in alert initially, but thought that content was important and would read it before continuing. 
  * "I probably wouldn't have seen the explanatory steps below. I think I should see that first."
  * "Oh! This is educational."
* Several participants stated they would read through the subway map before proceeding into the form.
* One participant said that they would not begin the form until she had all of the information in the subway map available.

#### What do they think about needing to provide their financial information?

Split reactions;

* Some participants said that the information requested was standard and expected.
* Some participants were concerned about the amount of information needed, especially assets.
  * "Ohh boy."
  * "I'm just a veteran on SS... I'm 74 years old, I don't have child care, clothing, and transportation... so I guess I'd have to muddle through all of this. Stocks, bonds, and real estate, if I had all of that, I wouldn't be asking for help. I can understand where they're coming from... and it's just um... something I don't care to do. I'd rather just pay. It just seems overwhelming."

### Form

#### Are Veterans able to easily complete each section of the form?

Veterans struggled on various parts of the form, including:

#### Would Veterans be able to easily provide their spouse's employment and income information?

Sometimes;

* Most participants stated that they would know their spouse's general employment information, but either estimate or ask for assistance when providing income information
* Participants' comfort level around providing their spouse's information greatly varied
  * Some were open to including it and understood why it was necessary, but others felt uncomfortable and unsure about why that information was required
  * One participant said they understood debts are "married", but thought education debts should be an exception

#### Is it clear to Veterans why they need to provide their financial information?

Generally yes, but they still don't like it.

* Most participants were able to identify why they'd be asked for their financial information for the sake of requesting financial assistance, but most felt like the form asked for too much detail. 
  * "I am becoming aware of the fact that the VA is no different than going to a bank - it's a little intimidating to me that the VA would be asking me all of these questions as a senior citizen."
  * "If this is what I have to do, I prefer not to. I could answer all these questions but I don't see the relevancy. It's not like I'm asking for a car loan."
  * "I'd rather just pay a little bit at a time than to have to go through all of this. It's intimidating. It makes one feel... what are you looking for? You saying I can afford this because I have a car? Let alone the fact that they barely run?" 
* Most participants could articulate how providing their income and expenses would affect their outcome, however a few participants believed that providing expenses could count against them.
* Several participants were extremely uncomfortable providing information about assets, believing that VA would repossess, put liens against, or ask them to sell their cars and other assets.
  * "Too technical, too much detail. Why do they need to know? Are they going to come and repossess my stuff?"
  * "I'm suspicious that they want to know all the information... it's going to be very difficult to get assistance from them because if push comes to shove, they can always find out how to seize my assets. I'm over 70 years old, so obviously, I'm suspicious. Especially since I'm a disabled vet, I put in my time, I feel it's none of their business."
  * "They want to get blood out of a turnip."
* A few participants noted that they would be wary of providing information about family heirlooms or items they've owned for a long time.
  * "Someone could have $10k necklace from their grandma that they would never sell. If they own a Camaro or expensive car that's brand new, then that's different. If it's things owned for years, then there should be a year limit." 
* When it comes to providing values, several participants said they would omit or otherwise devalue their assets for a more favorable outcome or to preserve their privacy.
  * "If I were doing it for real, I don't think I would include my other assets. It's not anybody's business, and I don't want anyone repossessing my jewelry."

#### Do Veterans understand each resolution option and the impact each one has on the form's processing order?

Most understood the resolution types available, however:

* 3 participants were confused why they were being asked to select resolutions multiple times
  * "Uhh ok... in other words, they didn't like my response! Is that what happened? I would probably try to find the reason that it went back to this screen."
* Multiple participants wanted to select waiver as their first option and wondered what the next step would be if the waiver was denied; there was interest in selecting multiple resolution options 
  * "If I request a waiver first, my question is... ok if you don't allow a waiver, then uh... do we get to negotiate one of my other two options?"

#### What do Veterans expect to do if they need to submit the form with revisions?

Veterans expressed multiple ways they'd expect to revise their submission, with most wanting to make edits using a digital format.

* 4 wanted to be able to go back and directly edit their form submission in a more streamlined way so they didn't have to fill the entire form out again
* 3 wanted to be able to submit a followup statement/addendum 
  * "Going through everything, multiple copies, would rather be short, sweet, and to the point. Say there's a change to the income and describe the change to the income and then a submit button."
* 3 would want to call to change their submission
* 1 would write a letter 
* 1 participant was worried that resubmitting the form with changes would put her at "the bottom of the list" 

#### Are Veterans able to easily use the new list loop component?

Overwhelmingly no; Veterans were able to input their data and complete the form, but they consistently misunderstood the capabilities of the list loop pattern.

* Most participants struggled with the type ahead component within the list loop cards
  * Most participants did not realize that it would give them options once they started typing, this led to some participants hesitating for extended periods while thinking of options
  * Nearly all participants thought they had to choose one of the suggestions given; they did not realize they could enter their own option into the field
  * Several participants would type in a few letters and then browse the suggestions in the dropdown
  * One participant even typed single letters individually to see if he "missed anything"
* A few participants would ignore the save button on the list loop cards, sometimes having several open and unsaved at once before continuing
* Several participants noted a few areas where entering their information in separately was labor intensive (e.g. individual credit cards and utilities)

### After submission:

#### What do Veterans expect to do after they've submitted their request? (Print?)

A majority of Veterans expect a confirmation or notification as well as

* 5 expected a followup timeline, with 1 specifying that they expected a followup phone number that they would call after the followup date passed
* 4 would check their email for a notification
* 3 expected an application/reference number 
* Multiple Veterans expected to obtain a copy of the submission 
  * 3 wanted to download the full document
  * 1 would take screenshots of all entries as proof 
  * 2 would keep a hard copy in case VA lost their submission 
* "Pray", "go drink a beer", "go lay down", "Congratulations, you lived!"

#### What communications do Veterans expect to receive about their request?

A majority of Veterans expected to receive communication about their request via email

* 6 participants mentioned receiving email communications after submitting the form
* Many participants mentioned follow-up communication from VA so they had peace of mind that their request was being processed 
  * I want them to be managing their caseload so that they have taken some kind of action in a period of time... and let me know that I'm in the queue for something and give me an opportunity to follow up on that. I don't want to fall into a black hole.

# Recommendations

### Short term:

* Include 'contractor' as an Employment Type
* Update the employment sections to allow multiple current positions
* Provide some content / guidance for current list loops; 
  * Alleviate concerns around repossession of vehicles
  * Detail what should qualify as "other assets"
  * Encourage users to include as many expenses as are reasonable
* Update the resolution selection screen to not loop through selected debts
* Include a "Request number" or "Confirmation number" on the confirmation page

### Long term:

* Rework all instances of list loops to be more accurately grouped and assistive
   * Consider providing a list of commonly added items and an ‘other’ option for items that are more specific to that Veteran’s financial situation  
* Incorporate form status notifications into the Debt Portal’s notification plan
* Reevaluate the concept of preferred resolutions (e.g. “I want a waiver, if not, a compromise.”
* Reinvestigation of summary page with the addition of medical copayment debts
* Reimagine scaffolding of Review page with the new one-question-per-page concept [broader initiative]
* Break out Credit Cards from “Installment contracts and other debts” section
