Research Plan for Debt Resolution Team, Financial Status Report (FSR), March 2021
====================================================================

As a designer I need to create a research plan to share with my team. (This should be filled out and maintained by the designer on the team & can be cross-linked and referenced in any issues.)

Goals
-----

**1.  What product & team are you doing this research for?**

This research consists of a usability test on the digitized Financial Status Report (FSR) form led by the Debt Resolution team.

**2.  Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?**

There are multiple resolution pathways a Veteran can select when resolving their debt including: requesting an extended payment plan, submitting a compromise offer, or asking for a waiver. These options all require the submission of a Financial Status Report (VA Form 5655), which captures a monthly snapshot of the Veteran's monthly household income and expenses. Our goal is to test the FSR's MVP with Veterans to uncover pain points and areas of improvement. 

**3.  Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?**

-   Do Veterans understand to purpose of filling out the form (The "so what" or "how does this help me?" factor?) 

-   Do Veterans understand the available repayment options?

-  Are Veterans able to easily complete each section of the form?

-  Are Veterans able to easily provide their spouse's employment and income information? (What do they need to know up front before completing this form, so they have this information on hand?) 

-  Is it clear why Veterans need to provide their financial information and assets?

-  Do Veterans understand each resolution option and the impact each one has on the form's processing order?

-  Are Veterans interested in being able to modify their FSR after submission? 

-  Are Veterans interested in being able to print their form after submission?

-  What notifications do Veterans expect to receive about their application?

**4.  Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research?**

-  Veterans will be able to identify and select which debt(s) they want to receive financial assistance for, but they may struggle to select a resolution option

-  Veterans might not know their spouse's employment history or complete monthly financial snapshot 

-  Veterans may feel overwhelmed when they begin inputting household expenses and assets, but may find the task easier when they see the predetermined list of input types

-  Veterans may be concerned about supplying information for assets such as vehicles 

-  Veterans may want to print a copy of their submitted application for their records

-  Veterans will likely not know all their financial information, such as payroll deductions, without needing to search their personal records

-  Veterans may be interested in the next steps after their application is submitted and when they can expect a decision from DMC

-  Veterans may be interested in updating their application if their financial situation changes or they forgot to include an asset

Method
------

**1.  What method of research are you planning?**

Remote moderated qualitative interviews and task-based usability testing using the unauthenticated version of the form in staging 

**2.  Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?**

We're using moderated qualitative interviews to understand our user's thoughts and experiences navigating VA-related debts. Much of the form's functionality can't be properly tested using a prototype, so we have decided to test in staging. We want to determine whether or not the form's flow is intuitive and uncover areas of improvement. Additionally, testing in staging will allow us to expand our recruitment criteria to include participants that use assistive technology.

**3.  Where are you planning to do your research? If in person, mention the location, point of contact, arrangements, etc. If online, mention which tool you'll be using (GTM, Join.me, etc.)**

Online Zoom meetings

**4.  What will you be testing? (Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)**

Unauthenticated form in staging

**5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)**

Zoom

Participants and Recruitment
----------------------------

**1.  Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?**

**Primary criteria**

This criteria is necessary to conduct the study. 

-   We would like a total of **15** participants

-   We would like **7-8** participants who have previously been notified about a VBA-related debt. Please include the following screener question:

   - "Have you ever received a letter notifying you about as Compensation, Pension, or Education debt from the Department of Veterans Affairs?"

      - Yes (Qualifies)

      - No

- As part of our study we'll ask Veterans to fill out the FSR to the best of their ability, so we would like our participants to be comfortable providing financial information such as their monthly household income and expenses. Participants **will not** be asked to provide PII and none of the information provided in the FSR will be saved or affect their VA information or benefits.
   - Please confirm participants are comfortable providing financial information such as their monthly household income and expenses 

-   Please confirm participants have Zoom downloaded prior to the session and they know how to screen share

-   For this session, we **are able to include** those who use assistive technology, such as screen readers (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and ChromeVox).

-   For this session, we **are able  to include** people with significant vision loss.

-   For this session, we **are able to include** people who use magnification tools.

**Secondary criteria**

This criteria contains nice-to-haves that creates a diverse participant pool.  

-   At least 1 woman

-   At least 1 person of color

-   At least 1 participant 35 or under and 1 participant over 55

-   At least one person that does not have a college degree (to include enlisted Vets)

-   At least one person that has a college degree (to include of officer Vets)

-   At least one person who lives in a rural or remote area

-   At least one person who lives in a major metropolitan area

-   At least one person with a disability rating of 70% or greater

-   At least one participant that has identified cognitive impairments and/or functional disabilities. Examples of diagnoses that may align with this would be Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), autism, and vertigo. Other conditions may be aphasia, dyslexia, dyscalculia, distractibility, memory loss, reading difficulties, low tolerance for cognitive overload, and intellectual/adaptive functioning challenges such as learning and problem-solving.

-   At least one non-native English speaker

-   At least one person who uses assistive technology (AT), such as specialized keyboards, switches, and/or hearing aids

When?
-----

**1.  Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research?**

March 17-22

**2.  Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready?**

We're testing in staging: https://staging.va.gov/manage-va-debt/request-debt-help-5655/

The pathway we're following will take them through a mocked authenticated flow by clicking "Start your application without signing in" so that we will not have people signing in.

**3.  Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be?** 

About 1 hour

**Please schedule 30 min buffer between sessions**

**4.  Availability:** If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S. Specify how much time you want between sessions, if any.

-  March 17: 9:30am - 5:00pm EST

-  March 18: 9:30am - 5:00pm EST
