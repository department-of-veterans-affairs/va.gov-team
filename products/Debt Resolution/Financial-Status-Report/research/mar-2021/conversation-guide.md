## Intro - 3 min

Thank you for joining us today! My name is \_\_\_\_\_\_, and I'm a designer and researcher for VA.gov. I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes for me. Today we're going to talk about a new way for Veterans to submit a request for financial help for VA debts. We want to make sure that this new feature works for Veterans' needs, so I'm going to ask you a few questions about your experience with VA debt collection and have you complete a fake debt resolution request. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

* This entire session should take about one hour. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We're not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
* During this test, I will ask you to share your screen so that I can follow along with you. When we get to that portion of the session, I will give you instructions on how to share your screen if you need it.\*\*
* Today, you'll be interacting with a tool in our staging environment. This means that it will look like you're on VA.gov, but none of your actions will be saved or affect your actual VA information or benefits in any way.
* While you're interacting with this tool, you'll need to provide financial information such as your monthly household income and expenses. Normally this information would need to be accurate, but for the sake of this test, you can provide estimates. None of this information will be saved or affect your VA information or benefits. Are you comfortable providing this information?
* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

## Interview Questions - 5 minBefore we jump into the session, can you describe your experience with VA debt?  

Have you ever filled out a Financial Status Report for a VA debt?  

* Can you tell me more about your experience completing the Financial Status Report?  
* Do you recall any parts of the form that were challenging to complete?  
Okay, please share your screen so I can follow along with you for the next portion of our session.  

##   

## First Task: Find info about financial assistance - 10 min

Imagine that you've been taking courses at your local college using your CH 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) benefits. However, you decided to reduce your course load and have  dropped a class. You've received letters about a CH 33 debt as a result of dropping the class, but you will not  be able to make payments. You're now trying to find information about your other options to resolve the debt. What would you do next?

\[Once on VA.gov\]

When you visit this site, do you normally log in before browsing? 

* \[If yes\] Would you mind signing in? 
* \[If no\] No worries! You won't need to sign in for this test.

Now that you're here, what would you do to find more options for your debt? Try to move a bit slower than you normally would on a website and talk me through what you're thinking.

---

Things to watch for:

* Where does the Veteran go, and what is their reasoning?
* If the Veteran uses the search bar, what keywords do they use, and what do they think about the search results?

## Second task: The FSR - 32 minutes

### Wizard

I'm going to paste a new link into the Zoom chat. Go ahead and click on it. [https://staging.va.gov/manage-va-debt/request-debt-help-5655/](https://staging.va.gov/manage-va-debt/request-debt-help-5655/)  

So you've incurred debts related to your Ch 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) benefits and you will not be able to make payments on them. What would you do here?  

\[If the participant does not end up at an FSR terminus, direct them to go to Compensation → Request debt relief → Veteran\]  

What do you think you'll see once you click on that button?  

Go ahead and click the green "Submit a Financial Status Report" button to move to the next step.

### Form introduction 

Alright! What would you do next?  

* Is there anything surprising or concerning about what this page asks for?  

\[Once complete\] Great. Normally you'd need to sign in to complete this form, but we've gone ahead and created a shortcut and pre-filled it with some fake information for our session today. Go ahead and scroll down the page about halfway and you'll see a "Start your application without signing in" link below the blue "Sign in or create an account" button. Go ahead and click that link.

\[Once complete\] Today we're going to imagine that you're Hector Smith and the personal information you're seeing is correct. Next, I'm going to ask you to fill out the form as if you were really requesting financial help for Ch 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) education debts. Try to fill out the form as completely as you can, but you can estimate the financial details you feel comfortable providing. 

As you move through the form, I may chime in to provide some direction or ask questions about the pages.
