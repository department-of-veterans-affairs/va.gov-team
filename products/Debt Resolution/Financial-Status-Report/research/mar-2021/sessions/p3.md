(Introduces self and team.)

We're going to chat about  a new way to submit for financial help. I'd like you to fill out a fake request. This session should take an hour. I may prompt you. We want to hear your honest opinions. I won't be offended. I'll ask you share screen so I can follow along. Today we'll be looking at it in a staging environment. It won't save any of your info. We'll ask you for financial info. You can give us fake values. Are you comfortable with estimates?

Participant 3:
Do you want me to grab W-2's?

Moderator:
Not necessary. 

Participant 3:
The only VA debt I have are copay type situations. They're usually not that bad. When I had insurance with my husband. His family deductible was $5,500 per year. I would get bills for $100. I would put off going to the doctor because of those high bills.

Moderator:
Have you ever filled out a financial status report?

Participant 3:
I've filled out means testing multiple times, but nothing changed in regards to payments. I'd go to va.gov to pay it.

Moderator:
Have you ever looked into other options to pay your copays?

Participant 3:
No. I didn't know there were other options.

Moderator:
I'll give you a scenario. Say you receive post 9/11 GI Bill benefits and you've dropped a class and have received a letter about that debt and can't afford it at this time.

Participant 3:
I would google GI Bill Debt.

Moderator:
Let's see what comes up.

Participant 3:
My tablet doesn’t want to do.

There's some choices.


I would probably click on GI Bill loan repayment.

Moderator:
We're trying to find other options to resolve GI Bill debt. Anything helpful here?

Participant 3:
No, I don't see anything. I would exit out of this and call my local VA and ask if anyone there knew anything.

Moderator:
Let's go to va.gov.

Participant 3:
This tablet is so slow.

Moderator:
Zoom uses up bandwidth. Just go to the va.gov link there.

Now you're at the home screen. Do you browse this site?

Participant 3:
Yes, I do. I sign onto the My HealtheVet thing. I had to call last time to recover my password.

Moderator:
We don't have to sign in. 

Participant 3:
It's a stupid password and I've forgotten it.

Moderator:
It's not super-important. Just go back to va.gov. What would you do to find more options to resolve your debt?

Participant 3:
Scroll around looking for everything.

I would go to the education section but I don't know anything would grab me. I guess I could change my current education benefits. 

Moderator:
What kind of phrasing would you expect to see?

Participant 3:
Maybe a help line or something.

Moderator:
So you would look for a help line to contact someone?

Participant 3:
None of these things would apply but I would hit education first. 

Moderator:
What kind of phrasing would you expect to see if there was a spot for it?

Participant 3:
Speak to a live person, a benefits coordinator or something to that effect.

Moderator:
I'll give you a link to the tool we're working on.
From Moderator (Moderator) to Everyone:  12:44 PM
https://staging.va.gov/manage-va-debt/request-debt-help-5655/

Perfect. As a reminder, our scenario is you've incurred debts and can't make payments. What would you do on this page?

Participant 3:
I would go to this learn how to request financial hardship assistance.


Moderator:
Click the more button and click your link again.

Participant 3:
What is the debt related to…it would be VA disability compensation, education, etc.

So what do I want to do? Here I would blow up because it's none of them. You're saying I want to change my…change it…so…

Moderator:
So you're looking for something that indicates change. You have a bill, a debt, and you want to make payments.

Participant 3:
So I would select the waiver?

Moderator:
Could you describe the difference between a waiver and a compromise?

Participant 3:
Waiver takes all the debt. A compromise would be, say, $1500.

I would then select Veteran. I would then click Submit a financial status report.

Moderator:
Would you submit on your tablet or a different device?

Participant 3:
The tablet.

Moderator:
Click on that button.

Participant 3:
I'd log in with My HealtheVet usually.

Moderator:
We won't do that for this. Would you immediately sign in?

Participant 3:
I would read the steps first before I filled out the form.

I'm surprised there's a VSO. I do a thing called Code of Vets, veterans helping veterans. Like when you file for disabilities--it's a lot of hoops. I tell those guys to get a VSO so you can get somebody who has already been through those hoops.

Moderator:
Is that a good surprise?

Participant 3:
It's a good surprise. A lot of people just give up without getting help.

Moderator:
Anything else on this page?

Participant 3:
No, should there be?'

Moderator:
Anything you would expect to see but aren't seeing?

Participant 3:
No.

Moderator:
If you submitted this form six months ago, what would you expect to happen on this page?

You said you would typically sign in first. Say you filled this out and something changed with your situation and you need to fill it out again?

Participant 3:
A page that would bring my original request form up so I could make changes without having two in the system.

Moderator:
We've created a shortcut and filled in some dummy information. There should be a link allowing you to fill out an application without signing in again.

Today you're Hector Smith. Your information is correct. I'm asking you to fill out this form.  The scenario is we're requesting help for the post 9/11 GI Bill.

Participant 3:
So I'm requesting help with tuition.

Moderator:
…you can add housing.

Participant 3:
I like it. I like that I don't have to enter info three separate times. That's how things get overlooked.

I'm re-entering my email address.

Moderator:
What kind of email responses would you expect to get?

Participant 3:
Maybe info requests for additional information or clarifications.

Moderator:
Like a VA representative?

Participant 3:
I would doubt it. Maybe somebody had read the form and made a call.

Am I employed?

Moderator:
Fill it out as if it's you. It makes the experience more realistic.

Participant 3:

Participant 3:
This is just going to be a guess.

Moderator:
How would you get that information?

Participant 3:
I'd have a W-2 and my paycheck sitting in front of you.

Are they talking taxes on the payroll deductions?

My thought they would be asking for taxes but maybe they're not. Maybe they're talking child support.

Moderator:
Anything you can think of that would make that more obvious?

Participant 3:
List it out there. Maybe type in payroll deduction and in parentheses (child support), that kind of thing.

Moderator:
Maybe we could add something related to taxes to this.

Participant 3:
I could put in his health insurance. They're wanting monthly. 'Payroll Deduction' made me think taxes and child support--things taken automatically out of a paycheck, like when you retire--a 401K or something like this.

I would also have this number written down: If you have trouble using this online form…

I'm in household income now.

Participant 3:
I work a fulltime and a part-time job. They would need to give me a still-employed status for the part-time job.

Moderator:
Just put in that you ended that job for the sake of the scenario.

Let's imagine this information is correct. What do you think of the way your benefit info is displayed?

What do you think about it being included in the monthly income?

Participant 3:
It should be because it's money coming into you. If my benefit is that amount then I don't need assistance.

Moderator:
What do you think about that amount being different from the total?

Participant 3:
I love me a phone number, the one starting with 'if this information isn't right….'. The first thing you want to do when you get lost is talk to a live body.

Moderator:
Would you know this information offhand?

Participant 3:
I try to keep everything in front of me when I'm filling things out.

Moderator:
You can skip payroll deduction--no, wait: enter fake information.

What do you think about providing spouse information?

Participant 3:
It wouldn't bother me. They want to know this when filling out means information. 

I'll guess at what I have in my checking account.

Participant 3:
I'll put zero for the savings bond thing.

Moderator:
Are you confident with your estimates or are there resources you would use?

Participant 3:
What do you call it when someone looks at your house?

Type of vehicle…

Estimated value of our car is a problem. I'd probably go on Kelly Blue Book and look?

Moderator:
What do you think about that?

Participant 3:
I don't think I would like that. 

Moderator:
Why do you think they ask this?

Participant 3:
They'd tell your car if you couldn't pay your bill.

Moderator:
Would you approach this differently?

Participant 3:
I'd be pissed on this one.

The state asks about Household assets like jewelry. I don't know if veterans would fill this out or not

Moderator:
Go ahead and fill out the utility bills section. You can make it up.

Participant 3:
If I click Yes they'll want every one of my credit cards.

Original contract or debt amount? Why would you have a debt amount?

Moderator:
What would you do in this situation?

Participant 3:
Delete it if it makes no sense to me.

Okay, this is where credit cards come up. That makes more sense.

Moderator:
You wouldn't expect a request for that previous debt amount to be on there?

Participant 3:
Definitely not.

I don't understand why you would have life insurance-related requests.

Moderator:
What kind of living expenses would you expect to find info for?

Participant 3:
Clothing and healthcare--including outside health insurance.

I'd probably put numbers in there as close as to what I do since it's related to lowering the payment.

Participant 3:
I like that financial overview.

Moderator:
Do you have enough information to make a choice?

Participant 3:
Yes, if you answered accurately. Maybe you could see--if we're on a budget--you can see where you're able to pay your bills. It's very eye-opening for people to see a breakdown of their money.

Moderator:
Say you're requesting a waiver. 

Participant 3:
I'm hitting this one because I'm asking for a waiver. In this box here, this is really good. You can be personal.


I think this box for a personal statement is really good. 

Moderator:
What kind of stuff?

Participant 3:
Hard times. I'll just put "Fell on hard times."

Will this show me all of them I had put in for? Do I do the waiver again?

So I have to do this three times?

Moderator:
Yes. What do you think about having to do it three times?

Participant 3:
I was able to do the books and housing all at once before so this is surprising,.

Moderator:
You would expect to do multiple debts. Would you expect different resolution options for each one?

Participant 3:
I would because I would want to pay it down as soon as possible. 

So I'm at a Review of my request. I would go into relief options to see what they had for me. 

This box is definitely giving me the opportunity to make different payments.

Moderator:
So what would you expect after submitting this form?

Participant 3:
I would expect an email letting me know the details.

Moderator:
What are your overall impressions?

Participant 3:
Very impressed. Most were self-explanatory.

Moderator:
Would you use this?

Participant 3:
Yes. The only things I found difficult were the deduction situations. It's very user friendly.

Moderator:
Any questions for me?

Participant 3:
None.

Moderator:
We'd like to offer you a thank you gift. Is that okay?

Participant 3:
Yes.

Moderator:
Do you know anyone who would like to participate?

Participant 3:
I tell people about things like this all the time. I like to see and learn and pass that info onto vets who come to me for help.

Moderator:
Thanks so much…Have a good rest of your day.
