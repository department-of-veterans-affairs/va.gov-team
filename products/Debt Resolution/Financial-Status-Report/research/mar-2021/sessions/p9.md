Meeting Date: 3/23/2021 11:00 AM

Moderator:
(Introduces self and team.)
This session may take about an hour…we want your honest feedback…we just want to improve the tool…during this session, I will ask you to share your screen. Today, you'll be interacting with the tool in our staging environment. Your actual VA information and benefits won't be affected in any way. We'll ask you to enter financial information--it can be fake numbers. Are you comfortable providing that information?

Participant 9:
Yes.

Moderator:
Can you describe your experience with VA debt?

Participant 9:
The last experience I had was over a prescription bill, of which I was incapable of paying. VA submitted it to Treasury. Treasury took it out of my Social Security fund. They took a healthy $350 out of my Social Security, which hurt me bad…I still have bills I need to pay. It left me without income. I couldn't pay for food and gas. I had to go to food pantries. It's about to happen again. I think I'll go to the VA and put down $50 to keep them from taking it out of Social Security.

Moderator:
Have you ever completed a financial status report?

Participant 9:
No.

Moderator:
Do you know how to share screen? There should be a toolbar at the bottom that says share screen?

Participant 9:
I don't see that. I see four little dots. Forgive me.

Moderator:
Are you on a mobile device?

Participant 9:
Yes.

Moderator:
You keep hitting mute.

Participant 9:
They're just a bunch of icons.

Moderator:
Is it an android or an Apple device?

Participant 9:
Android.

Moderator:
I'll look up Zoom Android UI and walk you through. What happens when you click on those three dots?

Participant 9:
I don't see those three dots.

Moderator:
(Helps Participant 9 resolve UI problem.)

I see it. Perfect. Please navigate to a web browser.

I'll set the scenario: imagine you receive post 9/11 GI Bill benefits. You've dropped a class and have received a letter saying you have a debt as a result of this dropped class and you can't make a payment. What do you do?

Participant 9:
Ask for help from family and friends. I wouldn't necessarily use the web to do that. I might try to sell books, things of that sort. I might try to use the web to get a credit card to pay for the debt. Those are all I can think of.

Moderator:
Navigate to va.gov.

Participant 9:
I could also ask for assistance from DAV or other veteran organizations.

Moderator:
Is there a process?

Participant 9:
You call the local Disabled Veterans. You make an appointment to discuss your needs. They  take information and pay for the money to solve a loan.

Moderator:
Have you ever visited va.gov?

Participant 9:
Yes.

Moderator:
Do you visit regularly?

Participant 9:
No, only to get prescription drugs.

Moderator:
Do you browse or log in?

Participant 9:
I have to login.

Moderator:
What would you do to find options available to resolve that post 9/11 GI Bill. 

Participant 9:
 I would do a search for financial aid for the VA bill. I'm unaware of knowledge about tuition or school. I usually use it for medical. With this, I would start with education. I'd read whatever they had regarding payment and default, things of that sort.

Moderator:
I'm going to share a link in the Zoom chat. 

Participant 9:
I need to go back to Zoom?

Moderator:
I'm going to put a link in the chat.

From Moderator (Moderator) to Everyone:  11:26 AM
https://staging.va.gov/manage-va-debt/request-debt-help-5655/

Do you recall seeing a chat button?

Participant 9:
Yes, hold on. I'll have to get this again.

Moderator:
I could share my screen if it's too frustrating to find icons.

Participant 9:
I found the chat.

Moderator:
Click the link and let me know when it opens. It looks like you stopped sharing your screen.

Participant 9:
It says request help with form 5655. This is for service members who need help.

Moderator:
We could have you share your screen again. If that's too annoying to deal  with, you can describe what you're seeing and we can go through the form.

Participant 9:
I apologize for this.

Moderator:
Not your fault. It shouldn't be this difficult to share your screen.

Participant 9:
I wish the icons were visible. Google will hold it.

Boom, there it is.

Moderator:
You've incurred debts from the post 9/11 GI Bill. What do you do now?

Participant 9:
I would look for a way to download the form. Then I would print the form, fill it out, and send it in.

Moderator:
Would you fill it out and submit it online?

Participant 9:
I would do that.

Moderator:
What would you do from here?

Participant 9:
I would select the first item, VA disability compensation, benefits.

And then what would I like to do? I'd like to…I'm undecided if I want to request debt relief--I would at least try to pay something every month. It wouldn't be much. I'm between a rock and hard place. I don't know whether to ask for forgiveness or pay it off.

Moderator:
For this scenario, you would request assistance.

Participant 9:
So I would select debt relief. Then submit a financial report?

Moderator:
Yes. What would you do next?

Participant 9:
It's instructing me to sign in. 

Moderator:
We won't have you sign in for purposes of this session.

Participant 9:
This is educational. This would be fantastic. I would continue reading to where it says prepare….they ask you everything under the sun here. 

Moderator:
Is any of that content surprising or concerning?

Participant 9:
Yes. I'd rather pay a little bit a month than go through this. 

Moderator:
Why is that?

Participant 9:
Car loans, student loans, credit card debt, expenses for food, gas, electricity…goodness. I'm just a veteran on Social Security. I don't have childcare, things of that sort. If I had stocks and bonds and real estate, I wouldn't be asking for help. I can understand where they're coming from. It's just something I don't care to do. It seems overwhelming. 

Moderator:
For the purposes of today, I'll have you take a look at the form. If you scroll to the bottom, there should be a link. Go to Start application without signing in. today we're going to imagine you're Hector Smith asking for financial help. Fill it out as completely as you  can. 

Participant 9:
I'll hit the continue button.

I would hit the Request help with this debt?

Moderator:
We're looking for the post 9/11 GI Bill-related education debts.

Participant 9:
Okay, so I guess I need to continue.

Moderator:
What were you thinking when you saw that 2nd post 9/11?

Participant 9:
I didn't realize there were other scenarios, so I needed to back up and punt. I knew this was regarding tuition payment.

So I would have to enter my email to get my request--I mean the form. It says this is the contact info we have for you. There's a phone number and email. I would enter Hector's email.

Moderator:
We have a bug with email entry here. It's also case-sensitive, which is another bug. Let's just copy and paste here.

Participant 9:
Should I say I have a job or not?

Moderator:
Fill out the form as if you were really filing for financial help.

Participant 9:
I'll say no to a job.

I'll say no to social security too. I'm (pretending to be) a student.

(Participant 9 is at Household assets.)

Moderator:
Would you know this information off the top of your head if you were filling out this form? 

Participant 9:
Yes, I would. In this scenario, I'm a student. A student is young, living at home, doesn't have a job.

Moderator:
What do you think about that question regarding vehicles? That information being requested?

Participant 9:
The VA is no different than going to a bank. It's a little intimidating that VA is asking me these questions as a senior citizen. My scenario is different from a student. I see what they're going to be asking me if I ask for a waiver. This is unlike the waiver that I asked for when I go the VA for medical. When they question there, they ask what is my income, and my income is social security only.  This is more complicated. My situation deals with prescription drugs. I don't know why they would put prescription in a different category. Medical is a lot easier. It's only social security. Would I have to go through this kind of scenario to get relief for prescription drugs. If this is what I have to do, I would prefer not to. I don't see the relevance of asset information. I'm not asking for a car loan. This is intimidating. What are you looking for, are you trying to say I can afford this debt because I have a car--even if it barely runs. If I had stocks and bonds, I wouldn't be asking for help. I'd be paying the bill.

Moderator:
Let's select no for this and continue to the next screen.

Participant 9:
(Participant 9 is at Other living expenses.)

(Now at Financial overview.)

Moderator:
Can you describe these different resolution options?

Participant 9:
A waiver is loan forgiveness. Extended monthly payments is the route I would go. A compromise…this is nothing more than a pay later, a forbearance-type thing where you can pay interest but not principal.

Let me hit continue.

(Participant 9 is now at Supporting personal statement.)

Moderator:
If you were completing that text box, how long would your response be to explain your situation?

Participant 9:
If I was a student, my response would be…it would take 15 minutes to explain a reason why. Being a student, I wouldn't be declaring bankruptcy.

Moderator:
I know we're over time. I only have a few questions. What would you expect to happen after submitting this form?

Participant 9:
I would expect a reply from the website, a response telling me how long it would take them to get back to me. I would expect an email or phone call or both to know if I would be considered for a waiver.

Moderator:
So you would expect follow-up correspondence.

Participant 9:
It would give me time as a student to talk to my parents regarding my request for a waiver and then go from there.

Moderator:
What would you do after submitting the form?

Participant 9:
Probably drink a beer. It would be a load off my mind that I took action to divert any collections as a student.

Moderator:
Say it's been a couple of weeks and your financial situation has changed, what would you do?

Participant 9:
Give them a call if I was able to pay the debt. If my situation was worse, there would be no reason to call.

Moderator:
What are your overall impressions?

Participant 9:
Stressful. I would rather just fill out the form (in hardcopy).

Moderator:
How would you rate it on being clear?

Participant 9:
I would give it an 8. I'm already stressing over finances. If I do this online--I would rather call them or download the form and take my time filling out the questions.

Moderator:
Any other thoughts or questions?

Participant 9:
Is it Miller Time yet? I appreciate what I've gone through with you. Unfortunately for Zoom it was very stressful. I'm very happy I've learned the hoops you jump through to get a waiver just for the prescription debt I owe. What is it with VA and not being able to pay for medical as opposed to drugs? Why is it so different? They know I can't afford the medical. Maybe if the VA told me every month this is what you owe and this is where you pay and how you pay. If they were better about educating veterans instead of getting a bill.

Moderator:
I don't know your personal debt. Recently those medical bills during COVID were forgiven. I would reach out to your Debt Management Center. It may have been forgiven.

Participant 9:
I had no clue it might've been forgiven.

Moderator:
Look into that. See if you qualify.

Participant 9:
That would be great. They never sent me a letter saying this debt's been forgiven or not. There's another thing there. They're lagging behind. Who knows?

Moderator:
Reach out and find out if it's been forgiven.

Participant 9:
That's medical, not prescription.

Moderator:
I really appreciate you taking your time to share your thoughts…to thank you, we have a thank you gift. Is it all right for Perrigian to reach out to you?

Participant 9:
Yes.

Moderator:
Do you know any veterans who might be interested?

Participant 9:
I do. I'll let them know.
