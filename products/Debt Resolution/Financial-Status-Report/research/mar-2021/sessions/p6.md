## P6 Notes
Meeting Date: 3/22/2021 12:30 PM

Moderator:
Thank you for joining us.
(Introduces self and team.)

Today we will chat about a new way for a new feature in debt collection.
(Briefs Participant 6 on process.)

During this session, I will ask you to share screen so we can follow along with you. Today you'll be interacting with our tool in our staging environment. None of what you enter will be saved. You'll be asked to provide financial information--you can make up numbers. Are you comfortable providing that information?

Participant 6:
Sure.

Moderator:
Can you describe your experience with VA debt?

Participant 6:
With this pandemic, it's a problem. I'm 100% covered under VA. Because VA here in Atlanta is closed, I have to use other facilities. I know VA will pay for it but because of the backlog, a lot of wrenches are being thrown into the mix to get those claims paid. I have a lot of chest pains and I have to go the ER there and that bill will be paid by VA but the question is when. It's now a ding on my credit report because VA hasn't paid it.

Moderator:
Have you ever filled out a Financial Status Report? It's also called VA form 5655--it's one of the forms you fill out when doing VA debt.

Participant 6:
I'm not familiar with that, sorry.

Moderator:
No worries. Are you using a computer?

Participant 6:
Yes.

Moderator:
(Guides Participant 6 to Share Screen.)

Participant 6:
Can you see the screen?

Moderator:
Not yet. I can see your screen. 

I'll give you a scenario. Imagine you've received a post-9/11 GI Bill--you've dropped a class and can't make payments. You're now looking for available options to resolve that debt. What would you do?

Participant 6:
I would start with debt relief options to see if what I'm looking for falls into that category. Or I would go to the DMC. It has a va.gov. Because I'm seeking assistance from VA. I would go here first.

Moderator:
Let's go ahead and instead of clicking on the links, just navigate to va.gov.

Participant 6:
Okay.

Moderator:
Do you come to va.gov often?

Participant 6:
Not often. I come here for my disability. I normally go to My HealtheVet for prescriptions. I've applied for…I've looked for a letter showing I am disabled from the VA. I also came here when I filed my claim for disability, to do an increase. I've come for VA medical records as well, when I moved…I normally go to My HealtheVet now.

Moderator:
Would you log in before browsing?

Now that you're on this site, what would you do to resolve the bill debt?

Participant 6:
I'd come over here…I don't know if it would be by school. With them not paying it any more, I'd go here.

I'd go surfing until I find what I need. You just have to play with it until you find what you need.

Moderator:
Did you see anything on that front page that looked helpful.

Participant 6:
I don't think I would go to view payment history. I would need to talk to someone. Do I need to change because it's not covered anymore? I need to know more before moving to the next step.

Moderator:
Let's say there was another link more specific to your search…

Participant 6;
For me, with my age, it would have to be specific to make it less frustrating. I would go into a spiral anxiety attack. Before coming to this session, I was doing a session about chronic pain…I'm not finding what I want in this area--a link in question form--it would have to be a question--maybe even FAQs, which I hate. It would have to be 'What if your benefits stop?' I don't want to do a lot of reading. It depends on your mental state. The hunt can give us a lot of anxiety. 

What do I do if my benefits stop--then it could say GI Bill. That would give me more information.

Moderator:
I am going to paste a link into the Zoom chat.
From Moderator (Moderator) to Everyone:  12:46 PM
https://staging.va.gov/manage-va-debt/request-debt-help-5655/

Participant 6:
I'll go to that link. Okay.

Moderator:
As a reminder, the scenario is you can't make payments for a dropped class.

Participant 6:
This is great. It helps with focus. It takes me back to the specifics of the question you're asking. I would go here first. I would read it before proceeding.

I think I would make a payment on the debt and hope my finances get in a better situation and I could do that. No, I would request an extended monthly payment plan.

Moderator:
Say you weren't able to make any monthly payments at all.

Participant 6:
(Selects Request debt relief (a waiver or compromise offer.)

Moderator:
Why did you select that debt relief option.

Participant 6:
Because of the pandemic, my income is all we have in the house…I would go with request for debt relief. I don't see where things will change for the better anytime soon. I've got an eleven year old grandson coming. Maybe I could do a smaller amount.

Moderator:
Do you see that button that says Submit a Financial Status Report. What do you think will happen?

Participant 6:
It would ask me questions regarding my debt.

Moderator:
You can click that button.

Participant 6:
Can I sign in?

Moderator:
We won't have you sign in. What would you do next now that you've gone to this page?

We'll go into the form in a moment.

Participant 6:
I would not contact the VSO since I've gone down that road before and it's just another paper trail.

Moderator:
Is there another resource?

Participant 6:
It all leads back to the fact I cannot pay. I can go through the Red Cross--so why not see if I can get debt relief. I don't see a future where I can make the payment.

Moderator:
Anything on this page that is concerning to you?

Participant 6:
So far, no I doubt. I have had to request assistance, I'm familiar with giving up a lot of information. I know I need to show that I need the debt relief. I don't see anything that's not needed. You have to be transparent and honest.

Moderator:
If you scroll down, you can see that Start your application line. Imagine you're Hector Smith. Fill out the form as if you're filling it out for that GI Bill debt. You can use your own or made-up information. I may chime in to ask questions or provide direction.

Participant 6:
Okay.

Moderator:
What are you looking for as you scroll?

Participant 6:
Can I select more than one?

Moderator:
Today, you're looking at the post 9/11 GI Bill debt for tuition. What do you think of the split--debt for tuition and debt for housing?

Participant 6:
I don’t know. I understand the split. This isn't for me. I can understand if you're having a problem with rent. I guess I would go with both.

Moderator:
Select both of those.

Participant 6:
I'll go with the books as well since they're all related. Continue?

Moderator:
Yes.

Participant 6:
Okay.

Participant 6:
(Participant 6 is at Household Income.)

Moderator:
What do you think about the benefit information being displayed here?

Participant 6:
I see it.

Moderator:
What do you think about the amounts being included in this form?

Participant 6:
Definitely include it. Even though…it does help. I think it's going to help insofar as what's going out. Because of other things I'm having to use my financial benefits for, it's putting me behind.

Moderator:
What do you think about that difference?

Participant 6:
I don't know why that $25 was taken. I'm confused. Why was the amount cut? I could use every penny right about now.

(Participant 6 is at Your other income.)

Participant 6:
I was looking for military retirement, something like that.

Moderator:
Do you think you can only select things in that dropdown?

Participant 6:
What I was looking at right now? Yes, that was the only thing that met the category I was talking about. That is the only thing in the dropdown that applies in the dropdown that I can utilize.

(Participant 6 is at Your spouse information.)

(Note that Form crashed at this point.)

Moderator:
Let's go back to that Chat link. Then we can quickly go through what we've done so far.

Do you know spouse employment information offhand?

Participant 6:
Not off the top of my head.

Moderator:
Now just continue as if you're filling out the form.

Participant 6:
My spouse does get Tri-care but I pay for that. I would say no.

(Participant 6 is now at Household assets.)

(Now at cars and other vehicles. Now at monthly household expenses. Now at monthly utility bills.)

Moderator:
Would you know these utility amounts if you were actually filling them out?

Participant 6:
Yes, since I pay them.

Moderator:
Do you have any thoughts on how you're putting in these utilities?

Participant 6:
I'm putting them in how they come to me monthly, in that order.

Moderator:
We can continue.

Participant 6:
(Now in Your installment contracts or other debts.)

Moderator:
Do you have any thoughts on the expenses you're entering?

Participant 6:
I would expect to write health insurance in here under other living expenses.

That's a big one for me. That has to be paid.

Moderator:
What do you think about supplying this information?

Participant 6:
I understand the necessity, based on my experience with the Red Cross.

Moderator:
What are you thinking as you look through this content?

Participant 6:
I'm struggling. I'm looking at the waiver.

Moderator:
What do you think of the financial overview? Does that look correct? Do you think you have enough information available to choose an option?

Participant 6:
Yes, I have enough information. 

(Participant 6 is now at Supporting personal statement.)

Participant 6:
We don't see a light at the end of the tunnel right now.

Moderator:
Okay.

Participant 6:
(Participant 6 is now at the Bankruptcy history section.)
I can just put anything here, right?

Moderator:
Would you need to access that document?

Participant 6:
Yes. It would take about 30-40 minutes.

Moderator:
Let's say you forgot to add an additional asset. I won't ask you to edit anything. What would you do to add an additional asset?

Participant 6:
I would go back and add something under the dependents and additional income. An additional $100 is coming to support the grandson. That would be the only thing. Hopefully I could back up and go to the area I need to change, and add that $100 to assets.

Moderator:
What would you expect to happen if you selected Edit?

Participant 6:
I would go in here and change this one.

Moderator:
What would you expect to happen after you submit?

Participant 6:
I would expect an email, something saying I would hear something after ten days.

Moderator:
What would you do after submitting the form?

Participant 6:
Pray.

Moderator:
Say something big happens with your finances, what would expect to do with this form?

Participant 6:
Say a job, something me or my spouse could reach out, that was real. I would submit a notification. I would request an extension--something based on my change in situation.

Moderator:
What do you think about editing this form after submission?

Participant 6:
I wouldn’t want it to go back to the bottom. If I was asking for a little more time because there's a job in the mix--if someone else has an opportunity to use it--if I could stop the process using this form instead of calling someone. It would save money and time and human power.

Moderator:
What would that look like for you?

Participant 6:
It would definitely be editing (capabilities). I would say it would come back to household. This was where the change was at. Right down here, because this would change if my spouse was employed and that would affect our income. 

Moderator:
At a later date and you came back to this form, this page is what you would expect to see?

Participant 6:
Yes. 

Moderator:
I'll see if my observers have any questions. What are your overall impressions?

Participant 6:
This is excellent. We've awakened from a deep sleep of comfort. The pandemic has made us change the way we do things. Veterans still matter. I'm in a lot of programs with other veterans. We're all trying to do the same thing. The more VA does things like this to show they haven't forgotten us. I think word is getting out there. Don’t lose hope. I think this is an excellent idea. I appreciate it.

Moderator:
How would you rate this experience?

Participant 6:
10.

Moderator:
Any other thoughts?

Participant 6:
Let's do it, let's get it done.

Moderator:
Would you use this tool for financial support?

Participant 6:
Most definitely.

Moderator:
Let me see if anyone has any questions. Do you remember how you selected the three post-9/11 debts. Remember how you selected a waiver for each of them?

Participant 6:
Yes.

Moderator:
There's no way to simulate what was being asked without going through it again.

Participant 6:
Each individual item was different. They were for different areas of education, that's why.

Moderator:
Make a new tab and go to va.gov. If you--have you ever used the search tool on this website?

Participant 6:
Probably not. 

Moderator:
Now that you've seen the tool we've looked at, what would you search for to find it on this page--what would you expect to see?

Participant 6:
I would come to education. I would ask for it to be specific: what happens when you have problems with education benefits? Or financial difficulties. To me financial issues under education benefits, an area covering that.

Moderator:
Let me see if there are any further follow-up questions. All right, doesn't look like there are. Any questions from you?

Participant 6:
Oh, no. You've answered all my questions.

Moderator:
May we send that gift to your email?

Participant 6:
It was a pleasure and an honor. 

Moderator:
Do you know any other veterans who might be interested in participating?

Participant 6:
I do. That would be great. Thank you to you and your staff.  I appreciate all you're doing. It means a lot.
