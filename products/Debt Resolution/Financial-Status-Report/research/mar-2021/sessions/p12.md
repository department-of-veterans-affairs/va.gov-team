## P12 Notes
Meeting Date: 3/24/2021 12:30 PM

Moderator:
(Introduces self and team. Describes the process.)

Participant 12:
I do about 4 Zoom classes per week. We're fine.

Moderator:
You'll be interacting with our staging environment…while interacting, you'll be asked to enter financial information. For the sake of this session, you can enter estimates or fake information. Are you comfortable with providing this fake information?

Participant 12:
My wife is the financial person but I can estimate pretty close. That's fine.

Moderator:
Can you describe your VA debt experience?

Participant 12:
I get medications from the VA. About a year ago--I always assumed they take care of copays with insurance and all of sudden I got this letter in the mail that I owed x amount of dollars. I was dumbfounded. I couldn't get an answer on the phone. I went to the VA. I talked to somebody who told me they didn't bill my copay. They wanted the balance right away. I didn't want to pay the balance. What happened is that I ended up going to a financial office--it took me forever to find it. Had to go back home, fill out a form, and finally got an answer that I could go back in and work out a monthly payment. I was working with my insurance to get reimbursed--I never was able to get separate copays, so I had to pay for it. I wasn't happy with that.

Moderator:
Do you remember the form you filled out when you went for assistance?

Participant 12:
I made good income until three years ago when I had a heart operation. I'm able to live comfortably. Not like I did before. I was finally able to do it. I got it down to a reasonable balance and just paid it off. Just before COVID, I never received--I got medications. I tried to find out what the copay was and couldn't find that information. I got a statement from them about a month ago where I owe this balance again.

Moderator:
Does the FSR ring a bell? Do you remember any of it that was a challenge?

Participant 12:
I ran a company. I'm used to filling out those forms. It's tedious. They don't make it easy. I had to find this financial office. It was way out in the campus in a mobile trailer, difficult to find. And when you get in there, half the people were on break or out to lunch. I could hear people doing personal phone calls. Very irritating. Other than that, they've provided good care for me compared to other plans I've had.

Moderator:
Could you share screen?

Participant 12:
Desktop 1? Click on it.

Here we go.

Moderator:
Open a tab in your preferred browser.

Participant 12:
Safari. 

(Participant 12 appears to be using a desktop.)

Moderator:
I'll give you a scenario. (Presents scenario.)

Participant 12:
That's happened to me. I had to drop a class because it was too much of a load, a physics class. I ended up getting another job to give me more income to pay that. That's what I did. Now, I'm way above school age.

Moderator:
Let's say you were looking for options to resolve that debt. What would you search for?

Participant 12:
I would probably go to the VA job service. They have jobs for you or help you with a job. Or I would go to their financial office in person to make those arrangements. You might as well forget calling them because they put you on hold. I use My HealtheVet a lot, especially since I did a pharmacy survey and I'm more aware of the capabilities of that website.

Moderator:
What kind of keywords would you look for on My HealtheVet?

Participant 12:
Billing office. I live way across town. I would send them a secure message rather than walk all over campus trying to find them.

Moderator:
Would you navigate to va.gov for me?

Participant 12:
Sure. 

Moderator:
Maybe close out of Safari and try again. Do you have a different browser?

Participant 12:
This is a Mac.

Moderator:
Maybe try typing in staging.va.gov. I'll put the link in the Zoom chat. 
From Moderator (Moderator) to Everyone:  12:47 PM
https://staging.va.gov/

Participant 12:
It's never done this before.

Moderator:
Try clicking on an incognito tab. Close out of the browser. Open again. Click on New Private Window.

I can share my screen.

Participant 12:
I can be with  you as long as we need to. Have you had this problem with other vets?

Moderator:
Not this specific issue. You might have a corrupted Safari browser. Can you see my screen?

Participant 12:
Yes.

Moderator:
Going back to that scenario. Let's say you navigated to va.gov.  What would you do?

Participant 12:
I would go to records. I don't see any other place to go to on these four boxes.

Participant 12:
I would go to search and enter Financial Balance. Then I would go to the top one, request hardship assistance. There's another one that says pay your copay bill and see how much I owed. Then I would go to the next one, Manage Your VA Debt. Then I'd go to hardship assistance.

Moderator:
You would click on multiple things?

Participant 12:
In sequence. I've never seen this screen. I'm at least on My healthyVet at least three times per week.

Moderator:
Do you ever visit va.gov?

Participant 12:
I will from now on.

Moderator:
What kind of things would you look for?

Participant 12:
I've been getting calls to get vaccinated. I had COVID over Christmas and recovered. I keep getting calls and search for that and for this financial assistance. I also have--my tax man died of COVID in January and saw this thing about debts--you can be eligible for tax assistance. A lot of friends have died of COVID died this last year. I'd look up burial benefits.

Moderator:
I'll open up that tool and share that screen. Let me know when you want me to scroll or select things.

(Re-explains scenario.)

Talk me through what you would do here.

Participant 12:
I'd read everything there. We're talking about education so I'd click on the first one.

You only get one click, correct?

I'd request debt relief.

Moderator:
What do you mean only one click?

Participant 12:
It doesn't say click all that apply.

I'm a veteran.

I'd click to submit a financial status report.

I'd then sign in. I'd want to look through these steps before I did that.

The way it's set up, I think the steps should be before that first box up on top. It's good to read steps before you create an account or sign in.

Moderator:
Anything concerning about what this page asks for?

Participant 12:
They want to know more than you want to reveal, but I don't see anything out of the ordinary.

Moderator:
Can you tell me more about more than you want to reveal?

Participant 12:
They don't deserve to know everything about your life. I've tried to reveal as much as I can get by with. I don't want to reveal too much.

Moderator:
Anything on this page causing that thought?

Participant 12:
Assets. That's what I would say is too much.

Moderator:
Normally you would need to sign in but we've created a shortcut and pre-filled it. I'll navigate there. You're Hector Smith and the information is correct. Next I'll ask you fill out the form as if you were really filling it out personally.

Participant 12:
Can I tell you a situation I'm having as we speak. Four years ago I found there's another Wagner with the same last four. There's another Wagner with the same last four. There have been quite a few times where they mixed up the other Wagner with me. Last week, I received a form and information--my info has been to his address and his info is coming to me.

I spent two hours from one department to the next. I'm always concerned about. When they ask last name and last four I have to give them my first name. I went to have some stuff done at dermatology and I told them my name is Participant 12. They had typed all the labels for the procedure and it was in the other Wagner's name. I never know if it's about me or the other Wagner. I don't know if that relates to this--last four of social security number. You wanted to know my complaints, right?

Moderator:
If this was your form, what would your reaction be?

Participant 12:
I'd be upset. I'd have to get in my car and go to the VA.

I'd continue from here.

(now at Veteran information.)

I don't see anything that relates to me right now.

Moderator:
We're doing the post-9/11 GI Bill.

Participant 12:
My tuition was before 9/11.

Moderator:
This is for the purpose of the scenario.

Participant 12:
I'd start with the first one.

Moderator:
You would select this debt first. I will select these ones for today. Once the debts are selected, what would you do next?

Participant 12:
Continue. I'd put my phone number and email address.

(Now at Your work history.)

No, I'm retired.

Type of work, I was a medical independent contractor. 


Moderator:
The information can be fake.

Participant 12:
Then I'd save.

Moderator:
We're going to imagine--can you describe what you're seeing here?

Participant 12:
They're just filling in the blanks, right? 

Moderator:
We'd imagine your information is correct.

(Now at Your other income.)

Participant 12:
Yes. Social Security…

Moderator:
We'll put in a fake number.

What do you think about putting this information here?

Participant 12:
They'll want to know income. In the past, they've incorrectly claimed I had a debt and they took it out of my disability compensation. If required, I'd put it in there and continue.

Just put yes.

(now at Household income/Your other income.)

I'd put retirement payments in there.

Moderator:
Would you know this information offhand?

Participant 12;
I have a good idea.

Moderator:
Would you estimate or put it to the penny?

Participant 12:
Estimate.

(Now at Your spouse information.)

Moderator:
Do you have any thoughts on this form asking spouse information?

Participant 12:
They'll find out anyway. 

Moderator:
Would you know this type (income) would you know this?

Participant 12:
I would reference with her.

Moderator:
Would she fill it out with you?

Participant 12:
I'd fill it out and go to her if I had questions.

Save and continue.

(Now at Your household assets.)

Moderator:
Do you have any thoughts on assets?

Participant 12:
I would estimate all of it.

(now at Your real estate assets.)

Single family home.

Moderator:
Would you estimate the value of your home?

Participant 12:
When we retired and moved to Arizona. Because people are leaving California, my house is going up in value every month.

Moderator:
How close would your estimates be?

Participant 12:
In thousands. My house has gone up about $50K. It is awesome but taxes go up with it.

Continue. And yes to Your cars and other vehicles.

I drive an SUV, an Acura. RDX model. 2012. I don't know what the value is. You can put down $10K. I'd probably go to Blue Book or used car dot com.

Save.

I have another vehicle. It's a car. A Lexus sedan. 2012. Probably worth $10K. I'd go Blue Book.

Save and continue.

No trailers or boats.

(Participant 12 takes a short break.)

Moderator:
I know we're coming up on time. I wanted to ask about the cars you input. What are your thoughts about those vehicles being asked about in this form?

Participant 12:
I'm suspicious. It's going to be difficult to get assistance. Push comes to shove, I need to know if they're going to cease my assets. Obviously, I'm suspicious. I'm a disabled vet. I put in my time. I feel it's none of their business.

Moderator:
Why do you think they ask that information?

Participant 12:
They want blood out of a turnip.

Moderator:
What would you do here?

Participant 12:
I would list I assume everybody else is putting down, like furniture, that type of thing.

I would estimate low on jewelry. I pan for gold but wouldn't enter that. None of their business. I restore motorcycles. They don't need to know that. I have some antiques, the value goes up and down. They don't need to know that.

Moderator:
Why do you think they're asking about these assets?

Participant 12:
I want to pay the least amount. They want me to pay most. That's typical.

Continue.

Moderator:
I'll put in fake information in Your monthly household expenses.

Participant 12:
They know people have household expenses. Continue.

In utilities put electricity, a hundred bucks and then go down the line. Continue.

(Now in Your monthly contracts and other debts.)

I'm actually debt-free right now. Wait, I do have an HOA that I pay.

They'd don't have that listed. Do you have to use what they have listed. I'd look at that list and choose from it.

Moderator:
Would you go through this list and choose from it even if it isn't what you want?

Participant 12:
Unless they had Other on there. 

Moderator:
Would you know this information?

Participant 12:
I would know it.

Moderator:
Would you know the date offhand?

Participant 12:
Something like that, yes.

(Now in Other living expenses.)

I'd put gas, a hundred. Save and continue. I'd probably add other stuff like food. Is that correct?

Moderator:
No right or wrong answer. Curious to see what you'd enter.

Participant 12:
I'd estimate high on that. As high as I could get by with.

Moderator:
What do you think of this financial overview section?

Participant 12:
According to what that shows, I would ask for a waiver. Continue down.

(Reads options.)

Usually you don't do a compromise until they say no. If that's the scenario, I'd put waiver. If I didn't get a wavier, then I'd go for a compromise.

Continue.

They didn't like my response, is that what happened?

I would try to find the reason they went back to this screen. 

Moderator:
Is that what you think happened?

Participant 12:
I'd put compromise.

Moderator:
For this exercise, we'll say waiver.

Participant 12:
(Now in Supporting personal statement.)

Moderator:
How many paragraphs would you put in this block?

Participant 12;
I'd just tell them I have negative income.

Moderator:
Do you see the submit application button? What do you expect to happen after submission?

Participant 12:
It would take a long time to get back to me. It would probably be a toss of the dice if they'd give a waiver. I'd probably have to submit other forms to ask for a compromise. I'd have to wait until I got a response.

If you go down to their office, they're more negative than positive, especially billing. You've got to wait a long time. They're in a crappy mood or say it'll take awhile or whatever. It's not an agreeable process.

Moderator:
What would you want to happen?

Participant 12:
I'd like a waiver.

Moderator:
Overall impressions about the form?

Participant 12:
Something I would expect. This reminds me of the IRS. I can do my taxes. I always had a tax person. It's tedious. 

Moderator:
How would you rate this experience?

Participant 12:
I'd give it a 7. This is easier than what you have to fill out in the past.

Moderator:
Any other thoughts?

Participant 12:
I'm happy these surveys are being conducted. A lot of veterans give up and say hell with it. VA is better than it was. I've been going there for years. It's only been the last few years they've done surveys like this.

Moderator:
We want to make sure it really works for veterans.

Participant 12:
The easier you can make it. I have aches and pains and have tried to have more compensations--it's a nightmare. You expect to have a no answer. We feel like we're not given enough. You have to fight for benefits. Right now, you go to the VA--my spouse can't go with me because of COVID. I'm all for making it easier.

Moderator:
Do you know any other veterans or caregivers that would like to participate?

Participant 12:
Sure. Thank you so very much. I'm up for it in the future.
