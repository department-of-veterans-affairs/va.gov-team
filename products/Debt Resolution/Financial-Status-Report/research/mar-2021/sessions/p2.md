(Introduces self and team.)
Today we're talking about a new way for veterans re debt collection. 

Participant 2:
Sounds good.

Moderator:
You're the first person to go through it. I may occasionally prompt you. We want to hear your honest opinions. We won't be offended…I'll ask you to share screen so I can follow along. Today we'll be interacting with the tool in our staging environment. It won't affect your actual benefits in any way.
For the sake of this test, we're fine if you provide estimates of financial information. None will be saved.
Will you be comfortable with providing this information?

Participant 2:
Yes.

Moderator:
I just have a few short questions. Can you describe your experience with VA debt in the past.

Participant 2:
I had a debt and got it resolved via services and my state senator, which was non-traditional. The treatment wasn't service-connected but should've been approved but was not. Someone gave me attitude and added a notation about me in my VA file and that's why I felt I had exhausted my options with the healthcare side. I am familiar with some of the tools.

Moderator:
Have you filled out a financial status report?

Participant 2:
Yes. It was a couple of years ago. I don't recall any difficulties.

Moderator:
That's the end of my general questions. If you could, please share screen so I can follow along.

Participant 2:
Okay. It says only meeting host can share meeting.

Moderator:
I can change that. Can you open a web browser? I'll set the scenario. Imagine you received a post-9/11 benefits. You've dropped a class. You've received a bill for that class but can't pay it. How would you go about resolving that debt?

Participant 2:
I would do a GI Bill dropped class fee. I would look for amount of fees on Google and then maybe go to the VA website.
I would look for a direct link to the debt relief hotline.


Participant 2:
I would look for mitigating circumstances.

Moderator:
Given you've received a letter regarding that debt, say $400 for books, housing, etc. What would you do on va.gov.
Do you normally log in?

Participant 2:
Depends on what I'm there for, if I'm checking My HealtheVet, I'd log in. For general things, I wouldn't log in.

Moderator:
What would your first instinct be for this kind of debt?

Participant 2:
Log in.

Moderator:
Would you mind signing in?

Participant 2:
I'd rather not if that's okay.

Moderator:
Now that you're here. What would you do to find more options?

Participant 2:
Starting at the top, I would go through the little boxes and see if the debt is related to healthcare, then I might click on one of the links in there or if it's education, I'd click on one of those…I like the box setup better. It's more user-friendly. This is also helpful when you're scrolling down and it has expanded things. Going from there, I'd go to education and training and also service member benefits. Finally, if I don't find what I'm looking for, I'd go to the Contacts link to look for a phone number or chat option.

Moderator:
You'd prefer chat?

Participant 2:
Yes.

Moderator:
What sort of link would you be looking for in those boxes?

Participant 2:
Billing or education--payment history. View your payment history, which I think would apply to debts?
Payment history to include what money was given for books and whatnot.

Moderator:
For healthcare debts, you think that would be called bills under healthcare?

Participant 2:
Yes, that or payment history.

Moderator:
I'm pasting a new link. Open it up when you see it, please. This will take it to the staging area so it won't affect your financial information.

Participant 2:


Moderator:
What would you do here?

Participant 2:
I might open that form in a different tab and go to learn about help with financial. I'd click the first option that says VA disability compensation and so on.

Moderator:
Go ahead and do that.

Participant 2:
Then I'd request debt relief.
As a veteran.

Moderator:
Are  you active duty?

Participant 2:
No, I'm a veteran.

Moderator:
Scroll up, please. When you request debt relief, what do you expect the options to be?
'Participant 2:
A waiver or compromise offer. You would see a form or another page to give you more information.

Moderator:
Can you explain the difference between the two?

Participant 2:
A waiver would wipe out your debt. A compromise is a payment plan.
I would read this box and request a financial status report.

Moderator:
Do that, please.

Participant 2:
I would sign in, see if there's anything I need to read or prepare.
I don't see anything surprising.

Moderator:
Say you've submitted this six months ago. Do you have any idea what you need to do?

Participant 2:
Unless I missed something, I don't see anything. Or if I'm missing anything on this one.

Moderator:
Normally you'd need to sign in to fill out the report. We've got one already filled out for you.

Please fill out the form as if you were Hector.

Participant 2:
I'm looking over the instructions.  I'm also selecting these repayment options to see what the options are.
In this scenario, are we attempting to--we're only doing post 9/11, correct? Is it specific?

Moderator:
Any thoughts on why those debts are separate?

Participant 2:
They're for different things.

Moderator:
Please select all of them.

Participant 2:
Okay, I'll click to continue.

Moderator:
Why do you think we're asking for an email address here?

Participant 2:
To send the information.

Moderator:
What kind of information?

Participant 2:
Details of the repayment plan. I forgot va.gov doesn't allow you to copy and paste.

Moderator:
Fill out the rest as if it was for you.
Why do you think that--imagine that information is correct that is being shown. Why do you think that benefit info is being shown there? Do you think that info should be incorporated into this for the sake of the form?
Why do you think the amount received is less than total?

Participant 2:
It could be they took money out to account for the debt.

Moderator:
You can move on now. Do you know the amount you receive on the top of your head?

Participant 2:
I'm putting in a fictitious amount.


Moderator:
Would you know the amount exactly?

Participant 2:
Yes. These wouldn't be the correct amounts but I would know them.

Moderator:
Do you have any problem adding spousal information?

Participant 2:
Yes, especially if it's something like an education debt. An education benefit--it really needs to be determined on the individual alone if they're disbursed from the 9/11 GI Bill.
This question about jewelry and art--things that would not be sold.


Participant 2:
Not to have an attitude, but I think that's a little much.

Moderator:
How much value should these objects have before putting them into the form?

Participant 2:
It depends. If that person owns a Camaro or expensive car, that's different. If this person has owned this heirloom for years, there should be a year limit.

Moderator:
Say you had a $10K necklace, what would you do on this form?

Participant 2:
I would be honest but if there was a thing to put in the comments that you could say if it's been appraised or not.

Moderator:
Would you mind selecting yes so we can look at it together.

Participant 2:
I'll make up a family heirloom for this.

I was trying to put in family heirloom. And there's inheritance. I would be unsure of what to put into the type of asset, especially if you weren't sure. For now, I'll put jewelry based on appraisal and then the ficticious amount of $10K.
It says what if I don't know.
I wish there was a question that said I don't know the value, what if my type of asset isn't listed here would be very helpful.

Moderator:
You thought you had to pick something from that list.

Participant 2:
Yes.

Moderator:
Would you know these amounts?

Participant 2:
Yes, but not for the sake of this test.
I don't like other living expenses--clothes, transportation, child care.
I'm uncomfortable with that question.

Moderator:
Why do you think  they're asking that question?

Participant 2:
…that would I assume show them your level of risk.

Moderator:
You said you were uncomfortable with clothing and transportation questions. 

Participant 2:
These are things that maybe shouldn't be decided unless your income is above a certain amount. At least for me--in my opinion, it's unfair for people who are struggling to choose between paying off this $200 debt or do I get food or medication I need, or transportation to job or school, or child care for my kid.

Moderator:
You think those things would count against you?

Participant 2:
I would type in childcare services.


Participant 2:
I think I've typed…

Moderator:
There we go.

Participant 2:
I'll select waiver when they ask what type of help.

This would be tough but it is useful to have a supporting statement. I'll just put in 'Because I can't' so I don't take up all our time.

Moderator:
What would you put in there?

Participant 2:
All mitigating factors. Also mention that I'd like additional living expenses are already hard for me to make, with all of this in mind, consider waiving my debt?

Moderator:
Did you expect to provide this kind of detailed context?

Participant 2:
No. They don't always give you room for a personal statement. If they do give you room for an explanation, it's not a lot. There's usually a character limit.

Moderator:
How long do you think you would need?

Participant 2:
One or two paragraphs.

Moderator:
If you would, step back to repayment options. What do you think that's providing you?

Participant 2:
The only thing I think would be helpful would be an overview and an arrow so you could see the full breakdown.

Moderator:
Why do you think the info is being provided on this page?

Participant 2:
Showing you what you've provided so far and what your real income is.

Moderator:
Can you describe what you think a waiver, monthly payment plan, compromise are?

Participant 2:
Extended monthly payments, payment plan, but what they're saying is different. With extended monthly payments, they'll keep all your benefits until it's paid off. The compromise is you're asking them to pay less than owed, you're settling the debt.

Moderator:
Do you think you have enough information to choose an option based on this?

Participant 2:
Yes.

Participant 2:
It keeps jumping back.

Moderator:
There is a bug. I'll have to sic my engineer on it. 
Say you forgot to add an additional asset. I won't ask you to edit anything. Talk me through what you would do to add another asset.

Participant 2:
I would select additional income, household assets, and then select whatever it is, then Edit, then go to that page where it says add. 
There's a button that says Add another asset here.

Moderator:
What would you expect to happen if you clicked Edit?

Participant 2:
To go to the previous page but it would be convenient if it didn't.  Say other assets is on page 5. To get back you'd have to click back or next or whatnot.
I like what they have here that says add another asset.

Moderator:
What do you expect to happen once you submit.

Participant 2:
A pop-up telling me, or an email, and then I'd be signed out and sent to the VA homepage. 

Moderator:
What would you expect in the email?

Participant 2:
Time and date submitted, with some information on the nature of it, without specific amounts presented.

Moderator:
You wait for a couple of weeks but something happens to your finances. 

Participant 2:
To go back to the form and submit some kind of edit.

Moderator:
What would that look like?

Participant 2:
To add whatever information is needed.

Moderator:
What was your overall impression?

Participant 2:
Straightforward. You're very nice. I thought it was pretty self-explanatory.

Moderator:
How does it contrast with the paper experience?

Participant 2:
This seems easier but I don't remember the paper version. I can only imagine it would look not as good printed out.

Moderator:
Would you use this tool to submit an FSR in the future.
I'll give my observers time to write down any questions I might have missed.
Do you have any thoughts to share with us?

Participant 2:
I really appreciate the opportunity and the compensation, as well.

Moderator:
That's all I have for you. We really appreciate your help…to thank you with a gift. Is it okay to send it to you…do you know other veterans who'd like to participate?

Participant 2:
I always send them the link. 

Moderator:
Thank you for your time. Enjoy the rest of your day.
