(Introduces self and team. Describes exercise.)

Today you'll be interacting with our tool in our staging environment. You'll need to provide financial information. For the sake of our session, you can provide estimates or make up numbers…are you comfortable providing that information?

Participant 11:
Yes.

Moderator:
Can you describe your experience with VA debt?

Participant 11:
I registered for 18 credits but only took 12 credits. Surprisingly, when I dropped that I accrued a debt of $47 and have never had any resolution. I don't know if I paid it back. I have no idea. Does a home loan count as debt to the VA?

Moderator:
Yes, it does.

Participant 11:
I've had multiple mortgages since 1984. 

Moderator:
Have you ever filled out an FSR?

Participant 11:
I don't recall.

Moderator:
If you could go ahead and share screen. Open a new tab in that browser, that plus symbol.

This scenario might sound familiar. Imagine you've received post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. (Describes scenario.)

What would you do?

Participant 11:
I'd go to va.gov and…

Moderator:
What are ou looking for?

Participant 11:
Looking for debt. Looking for my account. Do I sign in?

Moderator:
You don't have to sign in. What would you expect to see?

Participant 11:
I would expect to see my GI Bill and my mortgage benefits.

Moderator:
I'll paste a link into the Zoom chat. Do you know how to navigate back to the chat?

Participant 11:
I know what I'm looking for. 

Moderator:
Click that link.

With the scenario in mind, what would you do now?

Participant 11:
I'm not in my profile. 

I would click on--I don't need help. It doesn't say--I want to go to the form. I need a 'here' button. 

Moderator:
You don't have to sign in.

Participant 11:
There's no link for me to go right to the form. 

Moderator:
You would expect a click here button.

Participant 11:
You shouldn't assume people need help with the form.

I would click on the first one.

Moderator:
You can click on that.

Participant 11:
Why are these questions if I'm already going to the form. You would think you would ask these questions before you go to the form…because that would make a difference on what form you get. 

Moderator:
Do you think you're in the form currently?

Participant 11:
No, I don't feel I'm in the form. You should ask these questions up above. That would determine the form the person needs, part of the decision table on what form the person requires. I would think this stuff right here, it doesn't make logical sense to me.

Moderator:
If you can't make payments, what options would you select.

Participant 11:
I already said I'd make payments. Should I uncheck this box?

Moderator:
Do you think you should be able to do that?

Participant 11:
You asked me to request debt relief, this one right here. Maybe people don't understand what debt relief is.

Maybe say, 'I cannot make a payment' since they may not know what debt relief is…

Moderator:
What would you select next?

Participant 11:
I'm a veteran but I'm also retired. There's a difference between being a veteran and being retired. I'm receiving money from the DoD. The VA may be able to put a garnishment on retirement pay if a debt is owed to the VA. That category might be important to the VA. It's a big distinction between veteran and retiree. It was changed from dependent to retiree. I am a family member. Veteran is the only choice I have.

I'd click on submit a Financial Status Report.

Moderator:
We won't have you sign in but would that be your first inclination?

Participant 11:
Yes. How long have these existed?

Moderator:
We're digitizing it.

Participant 11:
This reads like what you do to do taxes.

Moderator:
What do you think about that?

Participant 11:
It's normal. Nothing unusual here.

Moderator:
We've pre-filled the form with fake information.

Imagine you're Hector Smith. I ask you to complete the form as if you personally were completing the form. You can enter estimates or phony information if you want.

Participant 11:
Do I click the others?

Moderator:
What do you think of the other post 9/11 debts? What do you think about them being split?

Participant 11:
Critical for accounting purposes. I don't think you can do it any other way.

That's up to the VA. It's tedious for the individual. 

Those are different periods of time. They can't be lumped together.

Moderator:
I'll have you do the tuition one, as well.

Participant 11:
Would you want me to reenter email address?

Moderator:
Would you?

Participant 11:
I would.

I didn't expect the VA would have a box saying I wouldn't get any solicitations.

(Participant 11 is in Your work history. )

Moderator:
We'll imagine your information is also correct. 

Why do you suppose it's  displayed here.

Participant 11:
…if they haven't taken any money out of debts owed, why would it be there?

Are you saying there's a screen with household income?

Moderator:
Do you think VA debts should be incorporated here?

Participant 11:
I don't know what they're trying to get to. That should be a recap, balance sheet to show this is your income and this is your expenses and this is your debt. There's no relationship of the info on this screen to anything.

Moderator:
No worries. You can continue.

Participant 11:
(Now in Your other income.)
Is it gross or net, before or after taxes. That's not a good question. I don't know what to put. There should not be single or divorced.

Moderator:
Why do you think they ask that?

Participant 11:
Tradition. It's insulting. I am divorced and it doesn't matter. Unless you can come up with a legal reason, they should get rid of it as prejudicial. 

(Now in Your household assets.)

What do you mean household assets? Oh, checking, savings accounts.

Moderator:
Would you know these values offhand or would you have to search for them?

Participant 11:
I would know them offhand.

(Now in Your cars or other vehicles.)

Moderator:
What do you think about these fields?

Participant 11:
Too detailed. Are they going to take my stuff? 

Moderator:
Would you know estimated values offhand?

Participant 11:
I'm just guessing. 

Moderator:
Would you guess if filling it out for real?

Participant 11:
I have an appraisal but it would take time to get it.

Moderator:
What do you think about providing that information?

Participant 11:
I wouldn't enter heirlooms and jewelry.

(now in monthly household expenses.)

It's not asking about utilities. There should be--they should be lumped all together.

Putting utility bills separately? That's a pain in the butt. I'm just putting $250 per month but it depends on time of year.

Moderator:
How long do you think it would take to enter all utilities?

Participant 11:
With Internet and TV and everything else? Credit card is another one. I have way too many. 

Moderator:
What do you think about putting them in separately?

Participant 11:
I have three credit cards. Monthly amount varies for each. Why do they need all this when all they have to do is pull my credit.

I've never had a credit report this onerous. That's an awful lot of detailed information. I'm asking them to fund me for a lot of debt with mortgages and so on. They can pull my credit report like everyone else. It goes back to time immortal and is more accurate.

(Now in Other living expenses.)

What do you mean if I said no? You shouldn't give me the option.  I have very little living expenses. 

Moderator:
Any you would want to include?

Participant 11:
I would want utilities--I would have utility defined, specified. You're considered poverty level if you don't have a TV.

Moderator:
You want it to be more specific on expenses?

Participant 11:
Life insurance, health insurance. Health insurance for civilians is horribly expensive.

(Now in Your financial overview.)

Moderator:
Does the financial overview look correct to you?

Participant 11:
It didn't include what they had down for my VA benefits and my disability. It should be separate….depends on how the VA is looking at it.

What VA is saying is they're only looking at my retirement pay….so they would say we understand why you can't pay back your $120 debt.

Moderator:
Can you describe the resolution options.

Participant 11:
I wouldn't have to pay on the waiver. I wouldn't get so much entitlement back . That's fair. 

So on the next one, they'll give you three years to pay it back in smaller monthly payments. So they're not going to give me benefits until the debts paid off.  That's for offsets.

Moderator:
What do you think about the compromise?

Participant 11:
I like the idea of an extended monthly payment. Your entitlements are only good for 15 years. Waiver might be the only way.

Compromise--that might be good for some people. The person could pay it off in full and it's done.

Moderator:
Do you have enough information to submit a resolution option?

Participant 11:
Yes. If I request a waiver and it's refused, do we get to negotiate the other two options? What happens if the waiver isn't approved?

Moderator:
That's a fair question.

Participant 11:
If they didn't approve the waiver-I only have two more years to use benefits, so 'd have to go for a compromise.

Moderator:
You can select waiver today.

Participant 11:
Check the box and hit continue.

And then do this one: select waiver.

I'm glad that they put '2 of 2' here to remind me this is a different debt.

(Now at Supporting personal statement.)

I'll keep it brief.

Moderator:
That text box for personal information. How long would that statement be?

Participant 11:
I would go for as much empathy as possible to get them to understand the reason  I need the waiver is because of financial hardship and because of timing. 

Moderator:
How long would that statement be?

Participant 11:
Are you giving me a character limit, I can see I could easily put in a 150 words.

Moderator:
Do you think there should be a character limit?

Participant 11:
I think 150 words is about max. It shouldn't be longer.

Moderator:
I have some follow up questions. What would you expect to happen after you submit the form?

Participant 11:
They would acknowledge receipt with something I can print out with everything I input, a record of everything I typed in, and then an email acknowledging receipt as well as what to expect in the future. I don't want to be left dangling, with contact information if I don't hear back in timely manner.

I print hardcopy and then put on Outlook calendar when to follow up by a certain date, then re-engage with VA.

Moderator:
How far out would you schedule turnaround time?

Participant 11:
I want them to tell me first. It's like Amazon who says they'll ship in two days. The timeframe they give me is what I base it on. I don't want them to put me on Ignore. I want them to manage their caseload and take whatever action within a given period of time, letting me know I'm in the queue and the opportunity to follow up.

Moderator:
If your financial status changes, what do you expect to be able to do?

Participant 11:
I'd like to be able to contact someone or go back into the application. Talking to a human being might be very slow. An automated process to update the form, which would trigger a startover, a do-over.

Moderator:
What would that look like?

Participant 11:
A new start date, a re-admission. That's a point well-made. What if you came into some money and want to settle accounts or you declared bankruptcy and are penniless, life events went in the other direction.

Moderator:
What is your overall impressions?

Participant 11:
You're asking for too much detail, especially for people who don't do this a lot. I've sold a lot of homes. For people who don't do this a lot, this is a lot for them to put such minutia in there. It's a real burden for them. They're not in a happy place to begin with, with a lot of debt. Expecting them to have paperwork they don't have. They'll be guessing. They'll just put stuff down, not telling the truth. Doing a credit check and going to public records would be more accurate.

Moderator:
How would you rate it 1-10?

Participant 11:
I'd give it an 8.

I think a lot of people who are younger would find this a burden.

You guys have done a really good job with format and setting up infrastructure. If people were sitting in an office--a counselor's office--with somebody. It's an awful lot, especially given the state of mind they're in.

Moderator:
On the other income, the retirement income, was that your retirement benefits?

Participant 11:
No.

Moderator:
How would (unintelligible)?

Participant 11:
You could really pad this. You're not asking for W-2's. It's all in tax returns, kinda. 

Moderator:
This has been really helpful…Do you know any other veterans who would like to participate?

Participant 11:
Yes. If you have an email that you want me to send out, I can send it out to my posse.  I will happily do that.

NOTHING FOLLOWS
