# FSR Usability Study, March 2021

## P13 Notes
Meeting Date: 3/24/2021 2:00 PM

Moderator:
(Introduces self and team. Describes process.)

Participant 13:
Most of my stuff is ancient history and dates back to 1977.

Moderator:
(Describes session.)

Today you'll be interacting with our tool in a staging environment…while you're interacting with the tool. For the sake of this test, you can enter fake information or estimates. Will you be comfortable with this?

Participant 13:
We'll play it by ear.

Moderator:
Can you describe your past experience?

Participant 13:
Horrible. I took a student loan. We had an argument overpaying it back over 10 year or 11 year period. The board of veterans appeals said 11. VA did not comply and issued a garnishment notice to my employer, which was the DoD. I sued and got a summary judgment. They paid me back what they took.

It started in 1977 and federal court got involved in 1992. It was a long time to wait for resolution. That was the VA then. Hopefully, it's not like that today.

Moderator:
Is that your only experience?

Participant 13:
I've had some copays. If you're less than 50% disabled, you have a copay for medical care and drugs. If you're more than 50%, then they make it retroactive for three years. They had to pay that back. That was automatic. They offered to do it. I didn't have to go after them.

Moderator:
I'll ask you to share screen.

Participant 13:
Which button do I push?

Moderator:
Mac or PC?

Participant 13:
PC.

Moderator:
There should be a share screen icon on your zoom screen.

Participant 13:
“Host disabled share screen.”

Moderator:
I'll fix that.

Open whatever browser you're most comfortable with.

(Describes scenario.)

Can you tell me what you'd do next?

Participant 13:
All I'm seeing right now is…

So what should I do now that I see it?

Moderator:
What would you do?

Participant 13:
I'd write the regional office and ask for a waiver. I actually had to drop a class. I was attending school in Detroit and was assigned by the government to Germany. They told me it wasn't an adequate reason to drop a class.

Moderator:
Do you interact with VA online?

Participant 13:
Va.gov, My HealtheVet. Checking my benefit bank account. I haven't used GI Bill since 1987, so that's not an issue. Mainly disability benefit. Monitoring my bank account, which was switched a couple of times without my authority.

Moderator:
Would you use it for debt resolution?

Participant 13:
If it's on there I would use it…that should be an option. For disability claims, there should be an option to deal with a debt on va.gov instead of sending letters and telephone calls and everything else.

Moderator:
Go on over to va.gov, if you don't mind. Do you normally log in.

Participant 13:
It automatically logs me in.

Moderator:
What would you do to resolve your debt?

Participant 13:
I'd go to education--maybe an option saying debt issues would be helpful. Unpaid copay bills. Either disability or healthcare should have something in there for debt.

Moderator:
What title would you expect?

Participant 13:
"Debt" or "Debt to the VA". You can get fancy but keep it simple. "If you owe VA money, click here."

You could have it in more than one place. I don't know where. It could ask if the debt was healthcare or education. The Debt to VA and then under that, Healthcare; i.e., copays, and Education.

Moderator:
I'll put a link in our zoom chat. While you're sharing screen, there is an option called more with an option called Chat.

Participant 13:
Click on the link in Chat?

Moderator:
(Repeats the scenario.)

What would you do starting here?

Participant 13:
I'd click the first one, VA disability compensation one.

I'd request debt relief.

Even if I could make the payments, I'd select debt relief to see if I could get it.

I'll click Veteran.

Submit a Financial Status Report, oh boy.

I'm an accountant. Detailed information as to income. How much money I've got coming in and those items VA considers non-discretionary.

I should see a list of items for income, non-taxable, taxable, depends on how much detail they want to go. I thought VA had authority to access tax records, line such and such from your tax return.

(Now looking at steps.)

You have to log in to do it. I definitely think you should log in before filling this out.

I don't see why they would need…if I owed VA money, I'd be sensitive about giving them my employers name for fear they'd garnish my wages.

You're a contractor at VA. In my job, I'd be the one awarding the contract.

"Other sources" is vague to me because you may have welfare checks or food stamps or Other that isn't on paychecks. Getting disability payments and lawsuit settlements--things VA would want to know. Other sources isn't clear because other sources might not apply.

Moderator:
Anything else surprising or concerning about what they're asking for?

Participant 13:
I'd be very uncomfortable providing it, depending on the detail they want. Stocks could be worth a dollar today and thousands tomorrow. Those assets--they can put liens against them.

Moderator:
Do you think they could or would do?

Participant 13:
No more than garnishing wages, but they did.

Moderator:
We've created a shortcut that's pre-filled with fake information. Today your name is Hector. I'm asking you to fill out the form if it's you. You can make estimates or provide fake information…

Participant 13:
Hit continue?

Moderator:
Yes.

Participant 13:
You said Post 9/11 for supplies or tuition?

Moderator:
What do you think about there being three of them?

Participant 13:
It's confusing. GI Bill gave me $500 and that was it. It wasn't segregated.

Moderator:
Veterans receive three of these payments for these areas now.

Participant 13:
I don't know how somebody could generate debts for books and supplies. I don't know how the GI Bill works. I don't know the requirements.

Moderator:
If you want to submit a request for GI Bill debts, what would you do?

Participant 13:
I'd click on the $80 bill debt. It would depend on what I got notice that I owed the debt for.

Moderator:
We want to select the post-9/11 related debts.

Participant 13:
I would presume tuition.

Moderator:
Let's assume you received bills for both tuition and books.

Participant 13:
They make this complicated. I was drawing $200 per month in the 80's.

Moderator:
It was simpler then.

Participant 13:
So I'd check all three and hit continue.

I like the What if my debt isn't listed here. My experience with calling VA is 'forget it'. You have to go into the office--they couldn't help you on the phone. I've checked those three. Hit continue?

Moderator:
Yes.

Participant 13:
I dislike reentering the email address. That should come off my records. If someone hacked my email address, the hackers would use their email address to divert it. I'd have to go back to the profile to change it.

Moderator:
What if it had been pre-filled up to that address box?

Participant 13:
I would be hesitant…why do you have to fill it in to begin with, the email address.

(Now at your work history.)

Moderator:
Use the form as you normally would.

Participant 13:
(Fills out form.)

Moderator:
Would you know this financial information offhand?

Participant 13:
I would but doubt most would.

(Now at Payroll Deduction.)

If you put federal income tax, it would change it.

Moderator:
What would you do next?

Participant 13:
(Adds payroll deduction.)

I'd have a dropdown here for income tax, FICA, etc. and then Other.

Participant 13:
(Now at Your VA benefits.)

Moderator:
Why do you think your benefit information is presentable here?

Participant 13:
Benefits are offset-able for debt.

Moderator:
What do you think about providing this?

Participant 13:
I agree with it.

That disparity between the two could be caused by lots of things. The veteran should know why they're not getting the amount they're entitled to. If you're getting $200 and then suddenly you're not--there might be an overpayment that needs to be paid. If you owe them $100, they would take it from the next disability payment unless you already had an arrangement in place.

I'm familiar with the government offsetting process. I was in contracts before. 30 years with government and I figured out how they work.

(Now at Your other income.)

I receive social security but doubt many applying for debt relief are.

I don't like this dropdown at all.

You're getting involved in tax laws here. It's like a mowing service--most do that kind of thing under the table and they could get into trouble if they put it on a government form.

The problem with bonus payment is if it's one-time or recurring.

Moderator:
How would you imagine that otherwise?

Participant 13:
People on wages plus commission and consider commission bonus. How would that be handled?

(Now at your spouse information.)

Moderator:
What do you think about providing this information?

Participant 13:
Yes and no. I would rather see 'Are you responsible for supporting other people?' I paid my then-girlfriend's expenses before we married.

Spouse info should already be on the VA's records. Going back, it asked about partnership. Why do you need divorced, separated.

Now dependents. I presume they would ask for name. That goes back to spouse. Why are they asking name of spouse if married and not registered partnership? Lack of consistency. It should be on record if I'm married, obviously.

If I was doing this, because of the sensitivity of the situation, I would ask if the spousal dependent is raising the family--that's a job.

In Michigan, you can't garnish my spouse's wages for my debt, so why would they need this work information regarding my spouse.

Moderator:
Do you have a problem with entering this information?

Participant 13:
I don't. Others might. My wife and I are consolidated, it's all one account.

Political sensitivity is what this whole thing is about. What rolls off my back is sometimes very sensitive to other people.

You're asking for a whole lot of sensitive information. They want all this information not to waive my debt, but to find sources from which to collect it.

Moderator:
How would you approach finding these numbers?

Participant 13:
I wouldn't have them off the top of my head but would have them in Quickbooks and look them up.

The 2nd question, the cash question--you're really asking how much cash is not in your savings or checking account. We're almost a cashless society, anyway.

(Now at Your real estate assets.)

I know what they're asking with real estate. They're asking if it's a home with a mortgage.

Moderator:
You selected Yes because you have a mortgage?

Participant 13:
Yes.

Moderator:
Do you expect to choose an item from the dropdown?

Participant 13:
There's no arrow at right showing it's a dropdown. I don't know if I have a choice. It comes up automatically.

It's way too much for a debt of a couple of hundred dollars. You asking for a level of detail that the GI Bill debt itself doesn't justify.

Moderator:
We're about five minutes out from end of session. Can we go over?

Participant 13:
Of course--if I'm helping.

Moderator:
Why are they asking about cars?

Participant 13:
Liens. Repossession. That's what this information can be used for. The VA at one point in time didn't have to go to court to get a garnishment number. As a private citizen, I wouldn't give them this information but then they would turn me down for debt relief.

They'd say, 'You didn't give us all the information we want, so we're going to deny it."

I don't know car value. I know it's a Ford. I don't know Moderatorel.

Moderator:
What would your approach here be?

Participant 13:
I'd just type in car.

Moderator:
You would estimate its value at zero?

Participant 13:
I wouldn't enter an estimated value for the vehicle.

You could link to websites that would give value to that line What if I don't know the estimated value of your vehicle.

(now in Your other assets.)

That's a loaded question. Do I own my wife's engagement ring? You’ve already asked for my wife's income information.

(Now at Your monthly household expenses.)

That number I don't have in my head. I'd have to look at records.

(Now at Your monthly utility bills.)

Moderator:
You don't have to add utilities in this manner?

Participant 13:
It's overkill. Make it one entry, all of them, a combined number. I'd have to look at records to come up with that utility information.

(Now at Your installment contracts and other debts.)

Why do you have to know what it's for? Why does VA need that break out?

This is way too detailed. If I owed a debt. I'd say I'd figure out another way.

Moderator:
You'd abandon the form? What would you do?

Participant 13:
I'd tell the VA I didn't want to give them all this detailed information. Too much hassle.

I'm reasonably sure you know BS means. Have you heard PhD. This is PhD to the 10th exponential. We don't even get this information from federal contractors on multi-million-dollar deals.

Moderator:
You skipped Other expenses. Any reason? Why did you select no?

Participant 13:
We can go back. Again, it's the detail.

Moderator:
What do you think that does for you?

Participant 13:
Hopefully, it would give the VA the discretionary and non-discretionary. Putting elderly care or childcare, I wouldn't disclose it.

I would stop at Stage 3, especially to a government agency to whom I'm certifying these numbers are accurate.

I would always ask for a waiver first.

Moderator:
Can you explain that to me?

Participant 13:
A waiver is debt erased. Monthly payments are just that. Compromise is offering them a payment they can accept.

Moderator:
Why do you think you're doing this again?

Participant 13:
Because one is tuition and one is books.

I don't think it should be broken out that way. Income and expenses should be the same. The debt should be the US government period. I don't know if there's statutory requirements for breaking books out from tuition.

As I see it, this is fenced money: tuition comes out of one account and books are another but this is all US money. I don't know if it goes back to the general fund or a specific tuition account. I don't know how GI Bill works. There may be limitations on how much can be waived. I don't know the particulars. If the VA has authority to waive only a certain amount, then why ask for a complete waiver.

(now at Supporting personal statement.)

Participant 13:
Right in there, I would write, 'ordered to leave the country so I could no longer attend classes', which was my previous reason for being liable for education debt. That would be why I should get the waiver.

Moderator:
How long would that message be?

Participant 13:
Depends on the situation, but I would keep it as short and sweet as possible. Attention spans are short.

I don't know if federal debt is offset by bankruptcy.

Moderator:
Why do you think we're asking for it now?

Participant 13:
Did you inform the bankruptcy court of this debt?

Yes or no here?

Moderator:
You can say no. We are over on this.

Participant 13:
It is a crime to knowingly submit a false statement.

Moderator:
How do you feel about that.

Participant 13:
I would be very cautious to make sure the numbers are accurate. I would have that statement on this form.

Moderator:
How sensitive do you think those numbers need to be?

Participant 13:
Within plus or minus 10%, I would guess. Any time you deal with people like myself, we have triggers. Contractors would sign financial statement and then later claim they didn't know what they were signing. Then there was a law that came down that they sign a statement.

Moderator:
What do you think should happen once you submit?

Participant 13:
It would give people sensitive information. It could be hacked. I wouldn't expect to hear back for 4-6 months.

Moderator:
You click the button, what would you see?

Participant 13:
It acknowledges it was submitted and gives you a tracking number, as well as the ability to copy the information that was submitted. If I was doing this live, I would make a screenshot of every entry. That's just me being paranoid.

Moderator:
What do you think about this?

Participant 13:
It does not have a document number that I can see.

Moderator:
A unique identifier for your request.

Say it's been a couple of weeks and something big happens to your finances you?

Participant 13:
What I would do and what other people would do are two different things. If positively, I'd pay it off. If negatively, I'd tell the VA that I was no longer able to make the payment.

Moderator:
Overall impression?

Participant 13:
Too much.

Moderator:
How would you rate it 1-10?

Participant 13:
6 or 7 at most.

Way too much information is required. If they want to seize my wages, this is where they could get the data to do so.

I hope I was of help.

Moderator:
(Wraps up session.)

Do you know of any other veterans or caregivers or active service members who might like to participate?

Participant 13:
No, I don't.

NOTHING FOLLOWS
