## P4 Notes
Meeting Date: 3/22/2021 9:30 AM

Moderator:
(Introduces self and team.)

Today we're talking about new ways for veterans to submit for financial help…I'll have you complete a fake request.

The entire session will take about an hour. I may prompt you with questions. We want your honest opinions.

(Briefs Participant 4 in detail.)

We'll be interacting with our tool in the staging environment. None of this will affect your benefits in any way…for the sake of this test, you can provide estimates. None of it will be saved or recorded in any way.

Are you comfortable with providing this information?

Participant 4:
Sure am.

Moderator:
Any questions?

Participant 4:
None at all.

Moderator:
Can you describe your experience with VA debt in the past?

Participant 4:
Medication billing in the past.

Moderator:
Please share screen with me.

Participant 4:
It says it's disabled.

Moderator:
Now you should be able to.

I'll give you the scenario. Imagine you received a post-9/11 GI Bill. You dropped a class. You need to make payments and want to seek other options.

Participant 4:
I'd talk to a counselor and talk to finance at the school.

Moderator:
Would you expect to talk to a person there?

Participant 4:
A veteran's rep. 

Moderator:
Have you ever used va.gov?

Participant 4:
It doesn't take me where I want to go. It was hard to navigate. I couldn't get the records or anything else.

Moderator:
Would you go there now. When you visit, do you login before browsing?

Participant 4:
I go to My HealtheVet.

Moderator:
What would you do to find more debt options?

Participant 4:
I'd go to the education section.

Moderator:
What would you expect to see?

Participant 4:
Education history.

Moderator:
I'll give you a link to staging. Do you know how to access Chat? 

Participant 4:
There we go. 

Moderator:
You've incurred debts and can't make the payments for whatever reason.

Participant 4:
I'd have to go to the first one here. The compensation, education one.

I'd hit financial status report.

Moderator:
Click on that.

Participant 4:
I'd have to sign in.

Moderator:
You won't have to for this test. It won't work in staging.

If you scroll down, is there anything you see that is surprising or concerning?

Participant 4:
(Reads steps.)

I don't see anything surprising.

Moderator:
We've pre-filled this with fake information.

Imagine your name is Hector Smith. Fill out the form as if you're Hector. As you move through the form, I may ask questions, what you're thinking about what you're seeing.

It's the post-9/11 GI Bill education debts.

Participant 4:
Okay.

I'm in Work History.

Moderator:
Would you know this information off the top of your head?

Participant 4:
Yes, I'd know this information.

I'm in Add payroll deduction. My check varies. 

Moderator:
If you were really filling it out, what would you do?

Participant 4:
I'd have to put a rough number in there.

Moderator:
Let's assume this is correct. Why do you think this benefits information is there?

Participant 4:
They're taking money from my benefits.

Moderator:
Why do you think that? What do you think about your benefits being included in this?k

Participant 4:
I don't think it should be. I don't think it's real income. It's compensation for disabilities…from the military.

Moderator:
You can continue when you're ready.

Participant 4:
I get social security disability. That's social security?

Moderator:
Yes.

Participant 4:
They take out child support.

Moderator:
Which would you put here?

Participant 4:
What I receive.

(Participant 4 is in Dependents block.)

Participant 4:
I'm in Household Assets. 

Moderator:
Would you know this info off the top of your head--accurately?

Participant 4:
Yeah, I would be pretty accurate. For the meantime I do, yeah.

Moderator:
When you typed home into that input, did you think you had to select one of the dropdown items?

Participant 4:
Yeah.

(Participant 4 is in the cars and other vehicles block.)

Moderator:
What do you think about being asked this information?

Participant 4:
So they'd want me to sell this or whatever.

Moderator:
You think they'd ask you to sell your car to pay the debt? How are you estimating the value of these items?

Participant 4:
I know what the truck is worth. 

Moderator:
What you think it's worth right now?

Participant 4:
Blue Book.

Moderator:
If you were filling this out for real, would you be concerned about providing this information?

Participant 4:
Not really.

(Participant 4 is in the monthly household expenses block. Now utilities. Now installment contracts and other debts.)

I have to put each credit card down and stuff like that?

Moderator:
What are your thoughts about that?

Participant 4:
I'd rather lump in what I owe rather than putting each card down.

Moderator:
Imagine you have just one card and fill this out.

Participant 4:
(Fills out installment contracts and other debts for sake of example.)


Participant 4:
I'd just guess on the date the debt began.

Moderator:
Why do you think they're asking for your living expenses here?

Participant 4:
To see what you have to pay and stuff. They want to know what your debt and cash ratio is.

Moderator:
How do you think that would affect request outcome?

Participant 4:
It would be beneficial for me. I can't pay this. They'd say you ran up this stuff and sell something.

Moderator:
Does this financial overview look right to you?

Participant 4:
Yeah, I guess that works.

Moderator:
How would you describe each of the options you have on this page?

Participant 4:
I like that first one there, the waiver. 

Moderator:
Can you describe the other two options?

Participant 4:
The monthly payment--you're already taking money from my benefits and I could use the money. Compromise, you want less. It doesn't seem feasible. We could throw out a number. I could pay $20 on it and you guys come back and say $100. We're not going to take less than a $100.

Moderator:
So you think whatever they come back is what's going to happen?

Participant 4:
It usually is.

Moderator:
Do you think there's enough information on this page?

Participant 4:
Yes. You guys will reduce the payment amount. 

Moderator:
What do you think about this page?

Moderator:
You don't need to fill this out completely. What information would you include?

Participant 4:
I don't have the financial means to make this payment. I won't be able to afford to live. 

Moderator:
How long would your message be?

Participant 4:
Less than a 100 words, probably.

(Participant 4 is now in Review.)

Moderator:
Say you forgot to add an additional asset, how would you do that?

Participant 4:
I'd go back to it.

Moderator:
What do you think would happen?

Participant 4:
It doesn't say add another asset. You should be able to add another asset here.

Moderator:
What do you think would happen after you submit?

Participant 4:
A thank you page.

Moderator:
Do you think outcome would be favorable?

Participant 4:
I think so.

Moderator:
Aside from confirmation, what else do you think you'll see?

Participant 4:
They'd say they're looking into it and it'll take 6-8 months. 

Moderator:
What would you do after submitting?

Participant 4:
I'd hit submit application. I'd download the completed form and print it.

Moderator:
Why would you print it?

Participant 4:
To keep a hardcopy for my files so I can go back and say I'd submitted this. They always say I didn't. I'd go to my VA rep and ask them to fix it.

Moderator:
Would you expect to access the completed form via va.gov?

Participant 4:
It was hard the last time I was in this site to get to where I need to get to.

Moderator:
Say something big happens with your finances. What would expect to be able to do?

Participant 4:
That's a good question. It doesn't give me an option here other than making a phone call.

Moderator:
What would you like to do?

Participant 4:
Be able to access it and say something happened. I'd like a little button to where I could show a change in status, something saying there's been a change of status related to income or assets or whatever--an amendment to the form.

Moderator:
A text box where you can type in whatever?

Participant 4:
Yeah.

Moderator:
What about a change in the form?

Participant 4:
That would be a big pain in the butt. I'd like to just show the change in income and describe and then amend and click the submit button and it'd say do this.

Moderator:
I have a few follow-up questions. What was your overall impression?

Participant 4:
It's pretty simple. Not like it has been.

Moderator:
How straightforward?

Participant 4:
A 7 or 8.

Moderator:
Would you use this form to submit an FSR?

Participant 4:
Yes.

Moderator:
Does anyone else have any questions? 

Can I ask you what device you're using,  Participant 4?

Participant 4:
A PC, a little gaming computer I built. 

Moderator:
I have one, too.

I have a question from an Observer. What would improve this experience for you?

Participant 4:
Having to put down each credit card--I should say overall rather than each one.

Moderator:
Anything else that would improve your experience?

Participant 4:
I'm looking down here and it's says I'll need to submit a new request.

Moderator:
Would you prefer a pre-filled form here?

Participant 4:
Yes, I'd prefer that.

Moderator:
Would you expect any communication from VA around this process?

Participant 4:
At least emails--updates telling me they're looking at it, basically. Updates on it.

Moderator:
That's all the questions my observers have. Any other thoughts?

Participant 4:
No, I don't.

Moderator:
Any questions?

Participant 4:
No.

Moderator:
(Thanks Participant 4 and asks him about any other Veterans who might be interested.)

Thank you so much. Enjoy the rest of your day.
