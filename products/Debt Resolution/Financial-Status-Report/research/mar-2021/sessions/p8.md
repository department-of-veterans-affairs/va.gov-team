## P8 Notes
Meeting Date: 3/23/2021 9:30 AM

Moderator:
Good morning, Participant 8.

Participant 8:
Morning.

Moderator:
(Introduces self and team.)

The entire session should take an hour. We may prompt you with a question…we won't be offended by any opinion you express. During this test, I'll ask you to share screen. I'll give you instructions. You'll be interacting with our tool in our staging environment. This won't affect your benefits in any way. You'll need to provide financial information…nothing will be saved. Will you be comfortable providing this information?

Participant 8:
Yes, I am.

Moderator:
A couple of quick questions. Can you describe past experiences with VA debt.

Participant 8:
I've received mail re medical bills I was responsible for. It wasn't too clear. It was always in hardcopy mail, nothing electronic. Without warning, it was taken out of my monthly payments. It noted it was VA debt I had to pay.

Moderator:
Were there other things that happened at that time?

Participant 8:
Statements in the mail without too much information. I started going to VA regularly in 2015. Prior to that, I didn't go. I've had different percentage ratings. Some have been approved. I started at lower percentage of disability to a higher percentage….all I know is that I started getting this mailers but no communication from VA. From one moment to the next, money was withheld from my disability.

Something outside of snail mail would've been better, with more information. Records would show $1200 of bills, here's a link to pay, or here's a link to set up a payment option, or here's a number to contact to speak to someone about it. I get so much correspondence from VA--that type of mail or appointment reminders--a ton of correspondence, esp. if it's a bill I don't understand. I just don't understand it.

Moderator:
Have you ever filled out a financial status report (FSR)?

Participant 8:
I have not.

Moderator:
What device are you using?

Participant 8:
An iPad.

Moderator:
Open a web browser. I'll set the scenario: you've received post-9/11 GI Bill education benefits. You've dropped a class but won't be able to make payments. Can you show me what you'd do next starting from here.
'
Participant 8:
I would go here (va.gov).

I would go to the education. Out of the four options, then change current education benefits, and then try to navigate this. I would say Manage benefits. View payment history. Then I'd sign in. That's what I would do.

Moderator:
What do you expect to see?

Participant 8:
A payment history. The first thing is on the left side--hypothetically--where it prompts me to do something if I've dropped the class or changed enrollment status. I'm hoping it would be intuitive to walk through. I've just gone through Chapter 30-something. There was forgiveness for dropped classes due to COVID. I did have to drop a class at the beginning of the pandemic. I was waiting for my counselor to guide me through. I guess it was forgiven. From a website perspective, I would want something intuitive, letting the powers that be that I've dropped the class. And then I'd get prompted on what to do next. It's too ambitious to think my counselor would be notified.

Moderator:
You'd look in education and pick something between those four. If there was a link to go directly to dropping the class, what would you expect that link to be called.

Participant 8:
I would imagine it would be called Change in current education status. That's what I would think.

Moderator:
When you go to va.gov, do you go here often? What for?

Participant 8:
I've got a pending claim. I was providing supporting documentation. I refill my prescriptions. I don't check my appointments--not an easy thing to do through the site. I usually call.

Moderator:
Do you sign in immediately or do you browse?

Participant 8:
I usually browse first. My Mac remembers my login information. Ever since VA adopted ID.ME, It's helped a lot. I don't remember...but that's basically what I do.

Moderator:
I'm putting a link in the Zoom chat to take you directly to staging where nothing counts and points don't matter.

Participant 8:
I'm there.

Moderator:
The story is you've incurred debts and can't make payments. What would you do starting from here.

Participant 8:
I would select copays.

Moderator:
Let's assume your debt is related to post 9/11 GI Bill.

Participant 8:
This is fantastic. It's descriptive on what to do. This is very well thought-out. All I would think would be related to education compensation debt is listed here. I'd want a quick way to make payments…if I want to make a payment, it's clear. If I have a disagreement, that's clear. If I want relief, that's awesome, or if I want to request a monthly payment plan or appeal, and that's great.

So let's say I want a payment plan. This is cool. This is really good.

Put this in production.

Moderator:
We're working on it.

Participant 8:
I love it. It's a really good addition. If they were to adopt this, it would be fantastic. They would save so much time in support. I feel like I'm being guided on what I need to do. It's critical that you're telling me here that I don't need to fill out that 5655.

Moderator:
The scenario is you won't be able to make payments at all. 

What would you do next?

Participant 8:
I'd have to sign in.

I probably wouldn't have seen the explanatory steps below. I think I should see that first.

All listed under Prepare makes sense. 

Moderator:
What would you expect to happen if you submitted an FSR six months ago.

Participant 8:
I would assume the system knows it's me and has it on file and would let me know if I had already submitted this.

Moderator:
We've created a shortcut on sign-in. Today we're imagining you're Hector Smith. Fill out the form as if you're filling it out for yourself. Fill it out as completely as you can with the details you're comfortable providing. We might have you do a couple and move on. As you move through the form, I might ask questions.

Participant 8:
I hate this poll thing that pops up.

I have no reasoning behind this page. I felt it was cluttered and had to take a step back.

I assume I've got a lot of classes related to my education benefits. I would want help with all of them.

Moderator:
The same help?

Participant 8:
I don't know. I'm assuming all of these things are part of my education benefit package. I would want to address all of them--if they're all past due, if they're all debt. If I'm seeking help for a debt, I'm going to want to see the debt in its entirety. I get that it's separated. I would be tempted to select every button.

Moderator:
For this test, select the bottom three. You notice there were no medical copays. Would you expect that?

Participant 8:
No, because I selected educational-related debt. I was a little bit flustered with how it's broken down.

Moderator:
That's because you selected education in that previous step.

Participant 8:
That's why I didn't expect any copay related debt here. Is this case-sensitive?

Moderator:
Yes it is, apparently. We'll address that.

Participant 8:
What if my employment is contract?

Moderator:
What would you select?

Participant 8:
Temporary. I do consulting work on contract. So I'll say Temporary.

Moderator:
For gross monthly income, do you know within $10 what that is?

Participant 8:
In contracting, it's a monthly flat fee.

Zero isn't an option here.

(Participant 8 is in Your work history.)

Moderator:
Let's imagine this information is correct. Why do you think benefit information would be showing here?

Participant 8:
It's part of my income.

Moderator:
Why do you think the amount differs.

Participant 8:
Good question.

It would be a negative for me. I would thinking they're holding back money.

Moderator:
It would be a deduction. 

Participant 8:
It would be better if it's more descriptive, if it told you that the difference was because of a deduction.

Moderator:
You can move on.

(Participant 8 is now at Your spouse information.)

Participant 8:
I hate adding spouse information. What does she have to do with this?

Moderator:
Would you have this information off-hand?

Participant 8:
I would. 

Moderator:
Why do you think we ask this information?

Participant 8:
You factor it in to my ability to pay it back. If the form requires it. I am asking for financial help. If it's part of the process, I'd have to do it but wouldn't be happy about it.

I don't know what my payroll deductions would be.

Moderator:
Would you estimate?

Participant 8:
Yes, I'd estimate but I would want to be accurate so I'd probably get a payroll stub. I'd want to be very detailed. I'm thinking if you're factoring this in, then this isn't the gross amount, obviously.

Moderator:
As you add payroll deductions, do you expect to select one of those every time. 

Participant 8:
I do, but I'm also noticing this is free text.

I am a typical user but have a background in software, so I know enough to be dangerous.

That dropdown was confusing.

The VA benefit question is relevant.

(Participant 8 is now in Your dependents.)

(Now in Your household assets.)

Participant 8:
That's an interesting question (How much cash question--TR)

What if I don't have savings bonds? It seems to assume that I have.

I don't like the menu. I would prefer dropdown with an Other option allowing you to be specific.

Moderator:
How did you feel about putting in that estimated value?

Participant 8:
We get a county appraisal report every year.

(Participant 8 is now in Your cars and other vehicles.)

I was going to do make and model first. So type of vehicle--depending on the letter I put in, the dropdown menu comes up, so when I put in D, motorcycle shows up.

No dropdown on makes and models. That makes sense. I'm sure there's a database you can tap into to make that easier.

Sorry, I know engineers hate that. I would've liked seeing a dropdown with makes and models.

Moderator:
How do you estimate the value of your vehicle?

Participant 8:
I guesstimated it but could've looked at the Blue Book value.

Moderator:
Why do you think you're being asked to provide this information?

Participant 8:
This is like the IRS. They want to know assets. One of the things not clear to me is I own this vehicle, but what if it was leased, which means it's not an asset. I don't see any car payment question. I would assume that would be in liabilities.

(Participant 8 is now in Your monthly household expenses.)

That was easy because I hear this from my wife all the time.

(Now at Your monthly utility bills.)

Moderator:
How do you feel about asking for your expenses?

Participant 8:
Expected. 

Moderator:
Do you pay quarterly for your water bill?

Participant 8:
Yes. Now I'm typing in letters to see if I've missed anything.

Moderator:
Did you see corn come up?

Participant 8:
Yes, I did. I don't know why that would come up in utilities.

(Participant 8 is now in Your installment contracts and other debts.)

I would answer yes to this. I don't like Credit card payments. Why not give it a section within itself and not grouped with other debts.

I guess I could always just tap. You see like…it's a little weird. None are overdue. 

Other living expenses makes sense.

Moderator:
Why did you say no to other expenses?

Participant 8:
We did have childcare. Oh, I remember: we did have training, gymnastics for my daughter.

Moderator:
What do you thinking providing more expenses will do?

Participant 8:
Provide a more accurate picture. If 90% of my income is going to expenses, then only 10% is left for the payment plan. I would want to be as accurate as possible.

(Participant 8 is at financial overview.)

Remember we said it was three.

This is required, that's good. That's clear.

Moderator:
Can you describe these options?

Participant 8:
Does that mean all these sections are required or just the waiver section is required? That thought came to mind.

This is either/or. My first inclination is to request a waiver. Let's assume I don't have the resources to make a payment plan arrangement.

Moderator:
You can select a waiver for each of these. Why would you not want to enter that?

Participant 8:
If I don't have to select something I won't.

Moderator:
Why do you think you're being asked to provide a different resolution for each of these debts?

Participant 8:
…it's feasible for me to make extended monthly payments or compromise based on my real debts. Either I want it waived, extend it longer, or make a compromise--but what I'd be thinking is most people would try the waiver. Most people would. The first question is would you send me to collections--are the letters going to continue or--worse of all of that--are they going to garnish my wages. They did it to me all at once in the past. The waiver puts it on hold. When would I find out if I'm rejected or approved? That would be my next question.

I almost forgot the Supporting personal statement.

Is there  a limit on what a user can type? You might get a short story if you don't. I don't think there should be a limit. It gives it more context.

Moderator:
How long would yours be?

Participant 8:
At least a paragraph, maybe two.

Moderator:
What do you think about this bankruptcy information?

Participant 8:
It's relevant, especially if it was more recent. 

Moderator:
Would you be able to provide a docket number?

Participant 8:
If it's recent. Two years is recent.

Moderator:
We might have a bug with that spinner going on.

I do have a few more questions.

What would you expect to happen after you submit the form?

Participant 8:
A submit button.

Moderator:
Once you click it.

Participant 8:
I would expect confirmation it's been submitted and an email message that I've submitted it--something electronic. I'd take a screenshot but that's just me.

Moderator:
When you were talking benefits, what did you mean?

Participant 8:
e-benefits. Then I would log out.

Moderator:
Say something big happens with your finances, what would you expect to be able to do?

Participant 8:
Great question. I think I would need to call somebody. If there is something online for change in financial status, that would be great.

Moderator:
How would you imagine submitting that additional information?

Participant 8:
A more streamlined form, almost like an affidavit attached to that--if there's a reference number, a reference number would be great. I would want to put that reference number in a short form. I could tell them I've won the lottery or long-term employed. I'd fill it out, give the details--something not nearly as long as this and submit it as an addendum.

Moderator:
What is your overall impression?

Participant 8:
Overall very positive. I'd give it an 8 out of 10.

Moderator:
Would you use this?

Participant 8:
Easy to use, much more intuitive than it is now.

Moderator:
Any other thoughts?

Participant 8:
No.

Moderator:
I'll wrap up. Any questions?

Participant 8:
I do not.

Moderator:
Your feedback is very helpful. Is it okay for our contractor to send that gift? Do you know anyone who would like to participate?

Participant 8:
I do.

Moderator:
Enjoy the rest of  your day.
