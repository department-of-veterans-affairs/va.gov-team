Meeting Date: 3/23/2021 12:30 PM

Moderator:
(Introduces self and team. Briefs participant on purpose of exercise.)

Today we'll be interacting with our tool in staging. This will not affect your benefits or information in any way. You will be asked to provide financial estimates that can be real or made-up. None is saved. Are  you okay with this?

Participant 10:
Yes.

Moderator:
Can you describe your experience with VA debt?

Participant 10:
Fortunately, I haven't had too much experience with the bill paying part of it. I'm healthy. My problem is with Medicare and trying to get that straightened out.

Moderator:
With a VA facility?

Participant 10:
Because I'm retired. I lost my last real job two months before retirement age. The company thought they would save some money, so I'm on reduced benefits and I was under VA care at that time for general stuff but still had to pay Medicare and I've been trying to get that resolved since 2016. Because I am under VA care, I don't need Medicare. I've been fighting that for five years now.

Moderator:
Hopefully, it gets resolved soon.

Participant 10:
It was supposed to be resolved in January but they blamed it on COVID. I'm going along with the rules…I think it's an excuse manufactured by somebody.

Moderator:
Have you received a debt letter from VA in the past?

Participant 10:
I joined the quit smoking program--which hasn't been successful--and I amassed a little bit of a debt and I was not contacted by VA until January. They said they wouldn't bill me because of COVID and then I got a bill for $300. Because I was unemployed, it was a shock. Things started to smooth out for me and I decided to pay it. They thought they would not do any billing and then decided they wanted their money in 30 days. It would've been easier to pay it a few dollars at a time and plus had I known about it, so anyway, it was a bit of a shock. I decided to pay it so I wouldn't have that monkey on my back.

Moderator:
How did you pay that?

Participant 10:
I got a large backpay. I talked to somebody and paid it over the phone.

Moderator:
What device are you using?

Participant 10:
My iPad. 

Moderator:
There should be a share screen icon.

Participant 10:
Share Content.

Moderator:
Share screen should be an option.

Participant 10:
There it is. 

Moderator:
We're looking to open up a browser and do some exercises to solve a particular scenario. We want to see what your screen is showing right now.

Open zoom. 

Participant 10:
It says screen, photos, OneDrive…

You want me to start broadcast?

Moderator:
I see it. Next, I'll ask you to open a browser--Safari, Chrome, whatever you use.

I'll give you the scenario. Imagine you've received a post 9/11. You've dropped a class but aren't able to make payments.

You want to resolve the debt. What would you do next?

Participant 10:
I do have that happen to a parent loan for my daughter. She took over my payments in my name. What is it, the direct loan Mohila. I don't know the password anymore. Because I'm a veteran, nothing happens until I die as far as forgiveness. She can't get relief because it's a parent loan, not hers.

Moderator:
Pretend you are the person who has dropped a class, so what do you do?

Participant 10:
Contact the person holding the note and tell them I'm not able to pay.

Moderator:
Who would that be if these were VA?

Participant 10:
With Mohila it was a forbearance. There's another word: forgiveness. I can't remember. I'd try and work out a payment plan.

Moderator:
How would you go about it with a VA education debt?

Participant 10:
Extend the payments or get lower payments to fit into my income.

Moderator:
Next thing I'll ask is if you would go to va.gov.

Do you ever visit this site?

Participant 10:
Only when I was trying to figure out the bill I got. I was trying to contact them to figure out…all they wanted to do was extend the payments over eight months. I didn't want to extend it and get interest and all that. It wasn't that much. Each facility bills you separately. Being in Sacramento, I'm getting bills from four different facilities.

I don't like it. It should be all in one. All in one for the veteran, but we all have our rules.

Moderator:
Why do you visit multiple facilities?

Participant 10:
I go to Sullivan. I have a 10% disability because of my hearing. Mather was the smoking cessation place. My online is Palo Alto. That's it.

Moderator:
Good thing it's online.

Participant 10:
I wouldn't get mileage anyway.

Moderator:
Your screen stopped sharing.

Participant 10:
I'm not great with this new technology. Is there a way to lengthen the timeout?

Moderator:
I don't think it will happen again. Do you usually login before browsing?

Participant 10:
Yes.

Moderator:
Now that you're here, what would you do to find options for that post 9/11 GI Bill debt?

Participant 10:
That's all military records. I'd sign in.

Moderator:
You won't need to for the sake of this exercise.

Participant 10:
What was the question?

Moderator:
You're looking for debt resolution?

Participant 10:
View your payment history under education.

Moderator:
What would you expect to see there?

Participant 10:
What you have paid.

Moderator:
If you have received a letter, what would you expect to see about that debt?

Participant 10:
That you're either current or in arrears, hopefully the whole setup.

Moderator:
I'll paste a link into the zoom chat. Go back to the Zoom window you were in before. Hit Chat and click that link. This brings us to a fake version of va.gov. Nothing counts.

(Moderator repeats the scenario.)

Could you tell me what you would do from here?

Participant 10:
It's asking for what debt it's related to. The government uses all these acronyms and I have no idea what it means.

Oh, education. There it is. It's about education. I'd click on that.

I would probably want a waiver or compromise offer.

I'm a veteran.

So I want to submit a Financial Status Report.

Moderator:
So signing in would be the first thing you do?

Participant 10:
Right.

Moderator:
Can you tell me if any of this is surprising and concerning?

Participant 10:
Work history is largely part-time. I haven't worked fulltime since 2018. 

All I have is a little bit of cash, real estate and cars. My wife passed away two years ago. Really, the only installment contracts is my car and the house, a few credit cards. My daughter's paying the student loan in my name.

Moderator:
What do you expect to happen next with this form?

Participant 10:
I'd assume they'd look at it and say they can't help. I don't have all that information in one spot.

Moderator:
Would you find all this stuff before you got started?

Participant 10:
I'd get my ducks in a row, so to speak.

Moderator:
We've created a shortcut with fake information. Scroll down and click the Start your application without signing in link.

Here's our fake data. Today you're Hector Smith. Please fill out the form as if it's you filling out the form. You can use your personal circumstances to fill it out. You can make estimates or provide fake data if that makes you comfortable.

Tell me what you're thinking or call it out if anything pops up that you like or don't like.

Participant 10:
Okay. The compensation and pension debt--that's not my debt, right?

Moderator:
This is just fake info.

Participant 10:
(Participant 10 clicked on education-related items.)

Moderator:
What do you think about this page?

Participant 10:
I had trouble on why there would be debt with associated with compensation and pension. I get that. That's a payment that I get. 

Moderator:
You're not sure what situations would lead to a debt?

Participant 10:
Right.

Moderator:
You can continue.

Participant 10:
Do I have to reenter the email?

Moderator:
Would that be your first instinct? You can try hitting continue. It is case-sensitive. It's a bit of a bug.

Participant 10:
(Enters Hector Smith email.)

(Now in Your work history.)

Do they want like on a resume, first job last or last job first, or does it matter?

Moderator;
Do you think it matters?

Participant 10:
Not really. This is fake anyway, right? Okay.

Moderator:
What do you think about being asked to provide this information?

Participant 10:
You get tired of repeating it with applications, like this request for help and so on and so forth.

Moderator:
You can fake this if you want.

Participant 10:
It doesn't matter.

Moderator:
If you were filling this out for real, would you use an iPad or some other device?

Participant 10:
I would use my desktop. I'm faster on a keyboard.

Moderator:
You don't need to provide every job. Let's imagine this information is correct. Why do you think this benefit information is here?

Participant 10:
They're trying to establish income.

Moderator:
What do you think about those benefits being included in your income.

Participant 10:
I don't understand. Payments come out of your income.

Moderator:
Do you consider VA payments as part of your income?

Participant 10:
No, because I use it to pay bills.

Moderator:
What do you think about those two numbers being different?

Participant 10:
I don't understand. Mine is always the same.

(Participant 10 is now at Your other income.)

(Now at Spouse information. Now at Household assets.)

These are fake amounts?

Moderator:
You can estimate or make up numbers.

What do you think about being asked to provide this information?

Participant 10:
I don't care as long as it doesn't go anywhere.

You just put in zero if you don't have any, right?

Moderator:
That's what you would do?

Participant 10:
Yes.

Moderator:
It looks like we're running up on our time. Are you okay staying over?

Participant 10:
Sure. Household assets. It's asking if I own real estate--yeah, me and the bank.

Type of real estate would be my home. (Accesses dropdown) Single Family home, there it is.

Moderator:
Did you think you had to select a dropdown requirement?k

Participant 10:
Yes, that's how it usually works.

Moderator:
You said you and the bank?

Participant 10:
I own more than 50% of it. 

Moderator:
How do you estimate your property's value?

Participant 10:
I'm looking at moving so I've been looking online and have a realtor friend keeping his eye on the market for me.

Moderator:
You can continue to the next section.

Participant 10:
(Now in Your cars or other vehicles section.)

No, I don't own the car yet.

(Now in Your other assets.)

No.

(Now in Your monthly household expenses.)

Moderator:
What gave you pause there?

Participant 10:
My mortgage and property tax and insurance is all rolled into one so I had to break it out.

(Now at Your monthly utility bills.)

Participant 10:
That's interesting. 

Moderator:
We won't make you add other utilities.

Participant 10:
The utility bill includes water, garbage, etc. Gas is separate.

(Now at your installment contracts and other debts.)

Moderator:
You can tell me what you think about filling this out.

Participant 10:
My car payment is $260. My credit cards, I'm working on those. They're about $300 per month.

Moderator:
Are any of these inputs--would you know them off the top of your head?

Participant 10:
It's time-consuming because it's fake.

(Now at Other living expenses.)

I put gas in the car, yes.

Moderator:
What other expenses do you think you would add here?

Participant 10:
Limited by COVID but do go out for coffee and tea. I'm joining the Elks Club, so limited socializing.

Would that be considered an expense?

Moderator:
How do you think these expenses will affect your request? Negatively?

Participant 10:
I hope not.

Moderator:
What do you think happens by providing expenses here?

Participant 10:
They would deny me because I'm a party animal, I don't know.

Moderator:
We can move on.  What are you seeing here?

Participant 10:
This is what I went through with that student loan, a waiver.

(Participant 10 reads through payment and waiver options.)

Moderator:
What do you think about these options?

Participant 10:
I've always opted for extended monthly payments, thinking things would improve in the future and never did. All I did was increase the value of the interest. I didn't have to make payments but interest kept accruing.

Moderator:
What would you choose here?

Participant 10:
I don't have enough to offer compromise so I'd probably apply for a waiver. I really don't feel that because my daughter's in education--and we did have a large sum of money. My wife decided to help my daughter with her loans. Then educator programs came out--because they're parent loans, they wouldn't help us. Now, because I'm a veteran, they won't do anything to help me. They'll forgive the debt when I die, a step I don't want to take.

Moderator:
What would you do now?

Participant 10:
A waiver if I could and them continue.

Moderator;
What do you think about being on this page again?

Participant 10:
It's sending me back to asking for help again?

Moderator:
Why do you think they're showing you this again?

Participant 10:
They didn't like the first one. What did I do wrong?

Moderator:
What would you put in Support personal statement?

Participant 10:
I feel at this point, my daughter's well on her way…but this is VA. I don't know. I guess the only thing I could say would be…a quotation from a hat I have.

Participant 10:
Have you ever declared bankruptcy? We did once. We cleared it in 2000. 

Moderator:
Do you think that should be considered here? 

Participant 10:
No. Ten years is long enough.

Moderator:
That brings you to the end. I have a few follow-up questions. One more.

Scroll down. What do you think happens when you hit submit, what do you expect to see?

Participant 10:
Congratulations, you've lived?

Moderator:
What would you expect to see, any other information?

Participant 10:
No communication.

Moderator;
Overall impressions?

Participant 10:
It was pretty good. If it helps va.gov handling us--normally those short surveys you get? You never see any change. Primarily with government entities, there should be some consolidation. I have to deal with three different pharmacies. The same doctor gives me three different prescriptions, I have to write three different checks.

Moderator:
1-10, how would you rate it?

Participant 10:
Probably an 8.

Moderator:
Would you use this tool to submit an FSR?

Participant 10:
Yes. It points out very clearly what I would need to file, and have it all compiled--and not when you're just sitting down to fill it out.

Moderator:
I'll go ahead and wrap us up. We appreciate your time…do you know any other veterans who might be interested in participating?

Participant 10:
No, ma'am.
