# Veterans Face Hurdles in Resolving Debt Online

*Financial Status Report MVP Usability Test Readout*

## tl;dr 
Veterans need clearer guidance and simplified tools to navigate debt resolution processes effectively.

## What we did
The Debt Resolution team conducted remote, moderated usability testing with 10 Veterans in March 2021. The goal was to evaluate the new Financial Status Report (FSR) design, capturing user behaviors and feedback.

## Key insights
- **Veterans struggle with form complexity** ([Line 131](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/Debt%20Resolution/Financial-Status-Report/research/mar-2021/readout.md#L131)):  
  - Quote: “It’s intimidating. It makes one feel... what are you looking for? You saying I can afford this because I have a [car]?”
- **Asset disclosure raises trust concerns** ([Line 134](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/Debt%20Resolution/Financial-Status-Report/research/mar-2021/readout.md#L134)):  
  - Quote: “Are they going to come and repossess my stuff?”
- **List loop component is not intuitive** ([Line 168](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/Debt%20Resolution/Financial-Status-Report/research/mar-2021/readout.md#L168)):  
  - Quote: “Most participants did not realize they could enter their own option into the field.”
- **Veterans want post-submission clarity** ([Line 195](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/Debt%20Resolution/Financial-Status-Report/research/mar-2021/readout.md#L195)):  
  - Quote: “I want them to let me know that I’m in the queue for something and give me an opportunity to follow up.”
- **Veterans expect flexibility for updates** ([Line 157](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/Debt%20Resolution/Financial-Status-Report/research/mar-2021/readout.md#L157)):  
  - Quote: “Going through everything, multiple copies, would rather be short, sweet, and to the point.”

## Between the lines
Veterans’ hesitations about sharing financial details reflect broader concerns about trust and transparency with VA processes. Simplifying language and providing reassurance could alleviate anxieties.

## Yes, but
While most participants found the process overwhelming, others felt the information requested was standard and expected. This divergence suggests an opportunity to customize the experience based on user profiles.

## Why it matters
This research aligns with VA’s goal of improving digital services for Veterans, particularly by enhancing accessibility and trust. Simplifying debt resolution processes supports OCTO’s key results.

## What’s next
- Clarify asset-related questions to address Veterans’ fears of repossession.
- Improve usability of list loop components with clearer instructions and examples.
- Introduce a form revision feature to allow updates without starting over.
- Include confirmation numbers and follow-up timelines for post-submission assurance.
