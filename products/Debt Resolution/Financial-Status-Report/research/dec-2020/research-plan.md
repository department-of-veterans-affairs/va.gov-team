Research Plan for BaM2, Financial Status Report (FSR), December 2020
====================================================================

As a designer I need to create a research plan to share with my team. (This should be filled out and maintained by the designer on the team & can be cross-linked and referenced in any issues.)

Goals
-----

**1.  What product & team are you doing this research for?**

This research consists of a usability test on the digitized Financial Status Report (FSR) form led by the Benefits & Memorials 2 team.

**2.  Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?**

There are multiple resolution pathways a Veteran can select when resolving their debt including: requesting an extended payment plan, submitting a compromise offer, or asking for a waiver. These options all require the submission of a Financial Status Report (VA Form 5655), which captures a monthly snapshot of the Veteran's monthly household income and expenses. Our goal is to test the FSR's MVP with Veterans to uncover gaps in the flow, pain points, and areas of improvement. 

**3.  Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?**

-  Is the form's title clear and understandable with the word 'debt' omitted?

-  Is the form's purpose and repayment types available clear?

-  Are Veterans able to easily complete each section of the form?

-  Are Veterans able to provide their spouse's employment and income information?

-  Is it clear why Veterans need to provide their financial information and assets?

-  Do Veterans understand each resolution option and the impact each one has on the form's processing order?

-  Are Veterans interested in being able to modify their FSR after submission? 

-  Are Veterans interested in being able to print their form after submission?

-  What notifications do Veterans expect to receive about their application?

**4.  Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research?**

-  Veterans will be able to identify and select which repayment(s) they want to receive financial assistance for, but they may struggle to select a resolution option

-  Veterans might not know their spouse's employment history or complete financial snapshot 

-  Veterans may feel overwhelmed when they begin inputting household expenses and assets, but may find the task easier when they see the predetermined list of input types 

-  Veterans may be concerned about supplying information for assets such as vehicles 

-  Veterans may want to print a copy of their submitted application for their records

-  Veterans will likely not know all their financial information, such as payroll deductions, without needing to search their personal records

-  Veterans may be interested in the next steps after their application is submitted and how long the form will take to process since repayments are time-sensitive

-  Veterans may be interested in updating their application if their financial situation changes or they forgot to include an asset

Method
------

**1.  What method of research are you planning?**

Remote moderated qualitative interviews and task-based usability testing on high fidelity prototypes

**2.  Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?**

We're using moderated qualitative interviews to understand our user's  thoughts and experiences navigating VA-related repayments. We're conducting task-based usability testing on a UXPin prototype to both determine whether or not the form's flow is intuitive and uncover areas of improvement. 

**3.  Where are you planning to do your research? If in person, mention the location, point of contact, arrangements, etc. If online, mention which tool you'll be using (GTM, Join.me, etc.)**

Online Zoom meetings

**4.  What will you be testing? (Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)**

UXPin prototype 

**5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)**

Zoom

Participants and Recruitment
----------------------------

**1.  Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?**

**Primary criteria**

This criteria is necessary to conduct the study. 

-   We would like a total of **15** participants

-   We would like **7-8** participants who have previously been notified about a VA-related debt. Please include the following screener question:

   - "Have you ever received a letter notifying you about a VA debt?"

      - Yes (Qualifies)

      - No

-   Please confirm participants have Zoom downloaded prior to the session and they know how to screen share

-   For this session, we are **unable  to include** those who use assistive technology, such as screen readers (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and ChromeVox).

-   For this session, we are **unable  to include** people with significant vision loss.

-   For this session, we are **unable to include** people who use magnification tools.

**Secondary criteria**

This criteria contains nice-to-haves that creates a diverse participant pool.  

-   At least 1 woman

-   At least 1 person of color

-   At least 1 participant 35 or under and 1 participant over 55

-   At least one person that does not have a college degree (to include enlisted Vets)

-   At least one person that has a college degree (to include of officer Vets)

-   At least one person who lives in a rural or remote area

-   At least one person who lives in a major metropolitan area

-   At least one person with a disability rating of 70% or greater

-   At least one participant that has identified cognitive impairments and/or functional disabilities. Examples of diagnoses that may align with this would be Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), autism, and vertigo. Other conditions may be aphasia, dyslexia, dyscalculia, distractibility, memory loss, reading difficulties, low tolerance for cognitive overload, and intellectual/adaptive functioning challenges such as learning and problem-solving.

-   At least one non-native English speaker
