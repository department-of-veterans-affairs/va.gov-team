Intro - 3 min
-------------

Thank you for joining us today! My name is ______, and I'm a designer and researcher for VA.gov. I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes for me. Today we're going to talk about a new way for Veterans to submit a request for VA debt resolution online. We want to make sure that this new feature works for Veterans' needs, so I'm going to ask you a few questions about your experience with VA debt collection and have you complete a fake debt resolution request. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

-   This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

-   In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

-   During this test, I will ask you to share your screen so that I can follow along with you. When we get to that portion of the session, I will give you instructions on how to share your screen.**

-   Today, you'll be interacting with a tool in our staging environment. This means that it will look like you're on VA.gov, but none of your actions will be saved or affect your actual VA information or benefits.

-   While you're interacting with this tool, you'll need to provide financial information such as your monthly household income and expenses. None of this information will be saved or affect your VA information or benefits. Are you comfortable providing this information?

-   If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

-   Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

    -   If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

Start recording.

-   I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

Interview Questions - 5 min
----------------------------

-   Before we jump into the session, can you describe your experience with VA debts?

    -   What type of debt did you receive?

    -   How did you resolve your debt?

    -   [If waiver, compromise, or extended payment plan]

        -   Do you remember submitting a Financial Status Report?

        -   [If yes] Can you tell me more about your experience completing the Financial Status Report?

        -   Do you recall any parts of the form that were challenging to complete?

Screen share

Okay, please share your screen so I can follow along with you for the next portion of our session.

First Task: Find info about financial assistance - 10 min
---------------------------------------------------------

-   I'd like you to open a new tab in your browser, and go to <https://www.va.gov/> 

When you visit this site, do you normally log in before browsing? 

-   [If yes] Would you mind signing in? 

-   [If no] No worries! You won't need to sign in.

Imagine that you've received a letter about a VA debt and the repayment terms don't work for your financial situation. You're now trying to find information about your other options to resolve the debt. Show me how you would go about doing that, starting from this page. Try to move a bit slower than you normally would on a website and talk me through what you're thinking.

**Things to watch for:**

-   Where does the Veteran go, and what is their reasoning?

Second task: The FSR - 32 minutes

### Form introduction 

I'm going to paste a new link into the Zoom chat. This link will take you to the online version of the FSR. (Paste UXPin link into Zoom chat)  <https://staging.va.gov/financial-status-report/introduction> 

Alright! Normally you'd need to sign in to complete this form, but we've gone ahead and put some fake information in for the purposes of our session today. 

Now, I'm going to ask you to fill out the form as if you were really requesting financial help for a compensation and pension debt. I may chime in to provide some direction when you get to some of the form's pages.

 When you're ready, go ahead and proceed through the form without signing in.

**Things to watch for**

-   Does the participant mention that anything's surprising or confusing?

Awesome! Since this is a fake form, we've gone ahead and put some fake information in to protect your privacy. We're going to imagine that you're [Name tbd] and the personal information you're seeing is correct.
