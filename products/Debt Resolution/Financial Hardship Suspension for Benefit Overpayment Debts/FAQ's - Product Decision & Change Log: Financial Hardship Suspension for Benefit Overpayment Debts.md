### FAQ's

### FAQ's

 **1. What are the different requirements for VBA? For VHA? The [current PDF form](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-10-10hs/) states it is under VHA. Is this correct? Is there another PDF form under VBA?**
- This form VA 10-10HS is only for VHA and not used for VBA overpayments. 
- For overpayments a Veteran will be required to complete VA Form 5655 in it's entirety. 

**2. Questions on 10-10HS:**
  - HOUSEHOLD INCOME (Includes gross income from employment, net income from farm or ranch, and other income amounts.)
  - DEDUCTIBLE EXPENSES (Includes non-reimbursed medical expenses paid by you or your spouse, funeral and burial expenses and expenses for the veteran's education.)
  - This initiative is strictly for Overpayment Debts. Digitizing 10-10HS is on the roadmap but at a later time. 

**3. What is the overall objective of this feature?**
-   The objective is to provide Veterans with a pathway to request financial hardship suspension 

    
**4. What does DMC envision related to the experience?**
-   An experience that leads with the three suspension questions
	- 1. Are you having a financial hardship? 
	- 2. Do you expect your financial situation to improve? (If no then it would kick it something that says a hardship suspension is not the correct path and then refer them to other options, waiver, compromise, or extended payment plan)  
	- 3. When do you expect your financial situation to change/improve. Please explain your hardship and why you think it will improve.
	
-   They would be required  to fill in all three prior to filling out the FSR.
-   A “no” on answers 1 and 2 would stop the hardship suspension request and refer them to other options
-   If all are answered - it would go to the Hardship Suspension Request in the FSR, we need the questions and answers prepopulated into the block 36 (remarks) and Hardship Suspension in Block
-   Once complete FSR takes the same path into DMC to start the approval process.
-   Adding Hardship Suspension as a fourth resolution option to the 5655 forms (1:  waiver, 2: compromise, 3:  payment plan 4:  Hardship suspension).
    

**5. What data needs to be transmitted to DMC?**
 -   Need it to populate Box 3 on the form to read "Financial Hardship Request"
-   Need Box 36 to indicate the answers to the 3 questions listed above
-   Is this all that is needed or will the Veteran also need to submit other information from 5655?
    
**6.  Do Veterans need to fill out ALL fields of  VA Form 5655?**
- Yes!  Veterans will be required to complete a full FSR/5655 form if they are requesting Financial Hardship Suspension.

**7. How do Veterans submit a request for Financial Hardship today?**
-   Calling into DMC
-   AVA
-   Through the mail

**8. Are there any metrics on how many suspension requests are submitted? (Total disputes received, via AVA, via Mail)**

**9. Do you have any metrics on how many hardship requests are granted?**
-  Typically requests for Financial Hardship are granted provided they have provided sufficient information.

**10.  What is the potential impact this feature can have?**
- Any Veteran with an overpayment debt could leverage this feature if they have a need. 
    
**11.  How long are financial obligations suspended should a Veteran be granted a suspension?**
- Typical suspension can last for up to 2 years but Veterans do have the option to request less time if they would like it. Typically done if a Veteran anticipates they only need 6 months to get through their current financial hardship/situation. 

**12. If suspension is granted how long is it granted for?** 
- Suspension can be granted for a maximum of 2 years

**13. Do we (as a development team) need to provide the Veterans with the option to change that standard 2 years timeline (i.e. if they only want 6 months)**
-  No, if the Veteran requests suspension they will have that for 2 years. They can use as much or as little of that time as required. 

**14.  Can a Veteran make a payment on a debt that has been suspended if they would like to?**   
- Yes. The Veteran is able to make a payment on a debt that is in suspension. 

**15. Does making a payment stop the suspension and reactivate the collection process?**

- TBD, Bob is investigating this answer

**16. After the 2 year time suspension time frame has lapsed can a Veteran  submit a new FSR to request another suspension?**
- Yes. The Veteran will have the ability to request another suspension after the two year timeframe has lapsed. 
  
**17.  Are there any restrictions during the time a debt is in suspension?**    
- There are no restrictions or events that the Veteran needs to do or avoid. For the VA, the Debt Management Center will not request payments or send debt to Treasury while it is in suspension status.
- 
**18. Are Veterans only allowed to request one hardship suspension per overpayment debt?**
- Yes, once the Veteran has submitted a request for hardship suspension they should not submit a second request until after a determination has been made. 
    
**19.  How are they notified when 2 years is up, or suspension is ending?** 
- The Veteran is sent a letter. 
- Copy of letter can be found here:  TBD coming soon
    
**20.  Will DMC require additional information after the FSR is reviewed for a suspension?**
 - Typically no, the details collected as part of the FSR will be sufficient to grant hardship suspension. In the event that clarity is needed the Veteran will be contacted. 
 
**21. How will a Veteran check the status of their suspension request?**
- At this time they will need to call the Debt  Management Center to check the status.

**22.  If the Veteran's financial situation were to change do they need to notify the VA and if so, how should they do that?**
-  Yes the Veteran can notify the VA if their circumstances change. Do to so they would need to contact the Debt Management Center by calling. 

**23. When suspension is expired they will receive another letter.** 
- Yes, the Veteran will receive a letter to notify them that their suspension is about to expire. 
- Copy of letter can be found here:  Link coming soon

**24.  If they submit a suspension for one overpayment debt. Are all debts they have suspended or just the one?**
- Yes, if the Veteran submits a supension request and it is approved then collection for all outstanding overpayment debts would be suspended.

**25.  How does/would suspension affect interest, fees or repayment plans?**
- There aren't many interest or other fees associated with debts any longer. If the Veteran had an active repayment plan then the associated payments would need to stop when a financial hardship suspension has been approved. 

**26. Does DMC or VA have any additional resources that they might send a Veteran who is experiencing financial hardship? i.e. Are there any financial counseling or educational materials available?**
- Yes, there are resources across va.gov that might be a good idea to provide as reference for Veterans are using 

**27. Why would a Veteran choose a suspension over a waiver?**
- Typically because the Veteran knows that the debt is valid and they want to repay it. A suspension will simply delay the collection until a later time but a waiver would remove the debt entirely. Many Veterans want to repay the debt and just need some time to do so.
