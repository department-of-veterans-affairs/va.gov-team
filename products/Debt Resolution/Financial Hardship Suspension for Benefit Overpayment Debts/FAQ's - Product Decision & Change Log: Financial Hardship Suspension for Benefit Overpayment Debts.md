### FAQ's

### FAQ's

 **1. What are the different requirements for VBA? For VHA? The [current PDF form](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-10-10hs/) states it is under VHA. Is this correct? Is there another PDF form under VBA?**
- This form VA 10-10HS is only for VHA and not used for VBA overpayments. 
- For overpayments a Veteran will be required to complete VA Form 5655 in it's entirety. 

**2. Questions on 10-10HS:**
  - HOUSEHOLD INCOME (Includes gross income from employment, net income from farm or ranch, and other income amounts.)
  - DEDUCTIBLE EXPENSES (Includes non-reimbursed medical expenses paid by you or your spouse, funeral and burial expenses and expenses for the veteran's education.)
  - This initiative is strictly for Overpayment Debts. Digitizing 10-10HS is on the roadmap but at a later time. 

**3. What is the overall objective of this feature?**
-   The objective is to provide Veterans with a pathway to request financial hardship suspension 

    
**4. What does DMC envision related to the experience?**
-   An experience that leads with the three suspension questions
	- 1. Are you having a financial hardship? 
	- 2. Do you expect your financial situation to improve? (If no then it would kick it something that says a hardship suspension is not the correct path and then refer them to other options, waiver, compromise, or extended payment plan)  
	- 3. When do you expect your financial situation to change/improve. Please explain your hardship and why you think it will improve.
	
-   They would be required  to fill in all three prior to filling out the FSR.
-   A “no” on answers 1 and 2 would stop the hardship suspension request and refer them to other options
-   If all are answered - it would go to the Hardship Suspension Request in the FSR, we need the questions and answers prepopulated into the block 36 (remarks) and Hardship Suspension in Block
-   Once complete FSR takes the same path into DMC to start the approval process.
-   Adding Hardship Suspension as a fourth resolution option to the 5655 forms (1:  waiver, 2: compromise, 3:  payment plan 4:  Hardship suspension).
    

**5. What data needs to be transmitted to DMC?**
 -   Need it to populate Box 3 on the form to read "Financial Hardship Request"
-   Need Box 36 to indicate the answers to the 3 questions listed above
-   Is this all that is needed or will the Veteran also need to submit other information from 5655?
    
**6.  Do Veterans need to fill out ALL fields of  VA Form 5655?**
- Yes!  Veterans will be required to complete a full FSR/5655 form if they are requesting Financial Hardship Suspension.

**12. If suspension is granted how long is it granted for?** 
- Suspension can be granted for a maximum of 2 years

**13. Do we (as a development team) need to provide the Veterans with the option to change that standard 2 years timeline (i.e. if they only want 6 months)**
