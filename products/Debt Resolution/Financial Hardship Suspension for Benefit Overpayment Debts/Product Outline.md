## Overview
Enabling Veterans to submit a request for financial hardship suspension for benefit overpayment debts, temporarily pausing debt collections while they navigate financial difficulties.

## Problem Statement
Many Veterans experiencing financial hardship are unable to meet the obligations of an overpayment debt. Without a simple, accessible, and compassionate process to request assistance, Veterans may avoid engagement altogether, leading to increased stress, deteriorating and delays in payments which could ultimately lead to the debt being sent to further harming their financial recovery.

Currently, there is no digital method for Veterans to request a pause in debt collection activities, forcing them to submit a request by calling into the Debt Management Center or submitting a request through AskVA.

  
## Desired User Outcomes
  - Veterans can easily understand and access a way to request debt suspension due to financial hardship.
-  Veterans feel acknowledged and supported during a vulnerable financial period.
- Veterans gain peace of mind knowing that collections are paused, giving them time to stabilize.
- Veterans maintain communication with the VA during hardship, leading to better long-term relationship and trust in the VA. 

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Veterans find the process too complicated or hidden and abandon the request.
- Veterans feel judged, stigmatized, or unsupported when seeking help.
- Veterans submit a request but receive no timely confirmation or next steps, increasing stress.
- Veterans are rejected without clear reasons or alternatives, leading to distrust.

## Desired Business Outcomes
- Increase in early and proactive Veteran engagement during financial hardship.
- Elimination of current suspensions not supported by adequate information/formalization.
- Reduction in negative Veteran sentiment and complaints related to collection process for overpayments.
- Enhanced VA brand perception as a compassionate and customer-centric company.

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Overuse of the hardship request process leading to prolonged processing times and delays.
- Increase in operational workload due to manual review of hardship cases.

## Measuring Success 
### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Submission Rates:** total number of hardship requests (what percentage of Veterans with overpayment debts submit dispute?)
- **User Satisfaction Score (CSAT)** related to the hardship suspension request experience.

### Objectives and Key results (OKRs)

Objective 1: Improve access to financial support for Veterans facing financial hardship.
- KR1: Launch online hardship suspension request feature to 100% of eligible Veterans
- KR2: Achieve a rate of 40% of all hardship suspension requests received electronically within first 3 months.

## Assumptions

- Veterans want a digital solution: We assume Veterans would prefer a self-service option online over phone calls to call center or MyVA request. 
- Veterans will be honest in their request: We assume most Veterans will not abuse the process nor overload the system 
- Collections pause increases financial recovery long-term: We assume temporary suspension of overpayment collections will lead to better financial outcomes for Veterans.
- Financial Hardship eligibility criteria are clearly understood: We assume Veterans will understand what qualifies.

## Solution Approach

We will launch a Veteran-friendly online financial hardship request experience accessible via the va.gov financial management portal initially as well as the mobile app in the future. The form will include clear guidance and easy to process flow.

We chose to start here because:
- It addresses the most immediate pain point: Veterans access to help through self service online format. 
- It provides low-friction relief to Veterans in financial crisis, reinforcing VA brand trust.
- It allows us to quickly test and iterate based on real Veteran behavior and feedback.
- Future phases may include automation in approvals, AI-based eligibility scoring, or integrated financial planning tools.
