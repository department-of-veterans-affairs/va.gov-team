# MCP's MVP UAT Conversation Guide
November 2021

## Project-specific setup

Sign in to Zoom.

We will be having users share their screens and testing the new VHA copay tool. When the participant is ready, have them share their screen.

When their screen is shared, send the link to www.va.gov.

**Note:** We will not be recording these sessions.

## Intro - 2 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Riley and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes for me. Today we're going to talk about a tool that allows Veterans to access their VA health care copay statements online. We've just built this tool and want to make sure that it's properly working in your account and that all of your information is showing up correctly.

Before we start, I want to mention a few things:

This entire session should take less than 30 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. If anything we show you is confusing, we want to hear about it. Your honest insights help us figure out how we can improve the Veteran experience, and we will not be offended by any opinions you express.

If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

## Warm-up/Screener Questions - 3 minutes

Alright, let's get started! I'm going to ask a few warm-up questions about your experience with health care copays. 

**1. Are you currently enrolled in VA health care?**

   1. If yes: 

      1. Do you pay a copay for health care visits?

      1. Do you pay for prescriptions?

      1. Do you know what priority group you're in?

**1. Have you received a letter in the mail from VA containing health care or prescription charges after October 1st, 2021?**

**1. Can you confirm for me that you have a DS Logon, MyHealtheVet, or ID.me account?**

**1. Do you know your username and password?**

   1. If no: Are these readily accessible? Could you get them?

   _If the participant cannot remember or retrieve their login credentials, let them know that this is necessary for the test and proceed to the [closing statements]._

**1. Can you tell me what type of computer you are using today?**

   1. If needed: I'm asking this question because sometimes the type of computer can affect your experience with the tools. Knowing which one you are using will help our developers make adjustments if needed.

**1. Can you tell me which web browser you use?**

**1. Today we are going to observe you interacting with the new tool on your computer. Would you feel comfortable sharing your screen with me?**

   1. If yes: Thank you! Please share your screen, and we can get started.

   1. If no: _Explain this is necessary for testing. If they are still unwilling, proceed to the [closing statements] and end the session._

## Navigating to the tool - 2 minutes

Go ahead and open a browser and navigate to VA.gov.

_Once the participant is on VA.gov_

Please sign in with your DS Logon, My HeatheVet, or ID.me account. 

I'm going to paste a link in the Zoom chat. This link will be the way we access the tool today. Please open the link in a new tab in your browser.

If something we see in the tool doesn't look correct, a developer on my team may chime in to get more information from this window so they can fix the issue. 

Under the alert that reads, "Review your VA copay balances", select the button "Review your VA copay balances"
