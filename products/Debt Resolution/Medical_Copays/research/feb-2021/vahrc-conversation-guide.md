## Intro - 3 min

Thank you for joining us today! Today we're going to chat about your experiences helping Veterans who have incurred VA healthcare charges. We're currently working on incorporating VHA debt into VA.gov's debt management portal, and we want to ensure that our designs will solve real Veterans' problems, so we're talking to experts like you to learn more. I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes for me.

* Since we only have an hour to chat, I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic to keep us on track.
* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
  * If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

_Start recording._

* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?  

## Interview Questions - 30 min

**About their work/departments**

First, I'd like to ask you a little bit about your job and department.

* How would you describe your role?
* What sort of experience or knowledge do you have that you feel will be valuable for us to draw from when designing for online VHA debt tools?
* Tell me about your department and the services it provides.
* Can you tell me a little more about the departments of VHA that touch the debt process, if they exist?  

**About operations** 

Now, I'd like to dig more into your interactions with Veterans.

* How many Veterans do you typically assist a day?
* What types of calls do you receive most often?
* Do you only receive calls about VHA copayments?
* What does a typical call look like?
* How long do these calls tend to last?
* Are there other methods Veterans use to reach out for assistance?  (ie IRIS, email, etc.)
  * Who fields these requests? 
* Is there anything that you're not really able to discuss with Veterans?
* What sort of goals are placed on you and those on your team? 
* What constraints do you have to work with?
* How do you think an online tool becoming easily available for Veterans could help you in your role?

**About the Veterans**

Next, I want to learn a little more about the Veterans themselves

* What kind of problems do you think Veterans are experiencing with their copayments today?
* Do Veterans typically know which priority group they're assigned to? 
* Can you describe the types of debt that a Veteran might receive from VHA? 
  * How big are the debts, usually? 
  * How big can they get?  
* What type of financial assistance do Veterans request most often? 
  * Why do you think that is?
* What sort of questions do Veterans typically have?  

**Repayment plans**
I also have a few questions about the repayment plans themselves.
* We noticed that payment plans usually require the Veteran to pay off the debt within 3 years - are longer repayment plans ever granted?
* What is the process if the Veteran cannot pay off the debt after 3 years?
* Is there a minimum monthly amount VHA will accept?
* We noticed that Veterans need to submit VA Form 1100 to set up a payment plan; do Veterans ever submit an FSR for payment plans?
  * If so, what would the next steps be?  

**Additional questions**
I just have a couple of stray questions for you before we start looking at the flow we presented before.
* What impact do you think providing Veterans access to their copayments online will have?
* Do you have any copayment stats you'd like to share with us?
* Is there any other information you think we should know about how Veterans interact with their copayments?  

## Flexible task 1: VHA flow workshop

I'm going to share my screen and pull up a diagram that shows our understanding of the VHA debt process, based on our online research.

Okay! So now we're going to look at this flow together to make sure I understand things correctly. We had to draw some assumptions while making this, so if something's wrong, feel free to shout it out! I've also got a bunch of questions to ask about the flow, so we will try to get to as many of those as possible before the end of our session.

## Flexible task 2: Current solution

* Can you tell me more about the way Veterans can view their copay bills online today? 

I'm going to share my screen and pull up a screenshot from the current experience so we can talk more about it.
