[Document referenced](https://www.va.gov/finance/docs/VA-FinancialPolicyVolumeXIIChapter05.pdf)

-   Emergency and Humanitarian Medical Care

    -   Not eligible for waiver consideration

    -   May request compromise offer

-   first-party insurance: If a Veteran's medical care qualifies for billing under reimbursable insurance, the copayment charge(s) will be put on hold for 90 days pending payment from third-party payer

    -   If not received within 90 days, charges will be released + statement sent to Veteran

-   DMC is responsible for offsetting the Veteran's comp + pen benefits in instances of unpaid first party co-payment debts

-   In addition to the co-payment, Veterans are also required to pay a $10 per diem co-payment for each day of inpatient hospital care, starting on the first day of care

-   Copayment life cycle:

    1.  Copayment info is automatically generated from the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) system for each VHA medical facility 

    2.  Info is forwarded to the Austin Information Technology Center (AITC) 

    3.  AITC produces statements for first-party co-payment debts through the Consolidated Co-payment Processing Center (CCPC)

-   Veteran will receive three statements which include new charges, unpaid balances, assessed interest and other late-payment charges

-   Statements are sent every 30 days unless there has been no activity for an additional 60 days

-   Statements will no longer be generated once a patient has gone through three statement cycles with no activity

-   Copayment referrals to DMC or TOP must be manually reviewed if the Veteran has a disability rating of 50% or greater or receives a VA pension

-   Copayments referred to DMC are input into DMC's system if the balance is greater than $25

    -   Balances less than $25 are stored in AITC for 60 days and a letter is sent to the Veteran informing them that it will be referred to TOP 

    -   DMC merges VHA and VBA debt data together before referring to TOP

-   Page 23 in the PDF contains a table breaking down follow-ups depending on the copay dollar amount
