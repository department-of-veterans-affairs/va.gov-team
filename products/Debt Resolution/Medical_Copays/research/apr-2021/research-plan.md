# Research Plan for Debt Resolution Team, Debt Portal Medical Copay Enhancement Discovery

As a designer I need to create a research plan to share with my team.

## Goals

### What product & team are you doing this research for?:

Debt Resolution Team's Debt Portal Medical Copay Enhancement

### Background: 

We released "Debt Letters MVP" / Debt Portal ([https://staging.va.gov/manage-va-debt/](https://staging.va.gov/manage-va-debt/)) for a subset of VBA debts in January. It currently includes Compensation, Pension, and some Education debts. We are now looking to enhance the existing tool by including VHA copayments and their corresponding Veteran Patient Statements. Currently, Veterans are able to access the last 6 months of their statements through AccessVA directly or by MyHealtheVet link. Due to some constraints at the beginning of the Debt Portal project, we weren't able to do full discovery, so we'd like to zoom out and validate some of our assumptions about how benefit and health debts should interact, if at all.

### Research questions: 

What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?

* Where do Veterans expect to interact with their VA copayments?
  * If on MHV or eBenefits, what would they be looking for and where do they expect to find it?
  * If on VA.gov, what would they be looking for and where do they expect to find it?
* Do Veterans expect to find their statements in their own area on VA.gov or among other VA debts/bills?
  * Does their expectation match their ideal?
* How do Veterans conceptualize the mailed Veteran Patient Statements? As debts, bills, something else?
* Where do Veterans struggle to interpret their Veteran Patient Statements?
* How do Veterans prioritize information on the statements? 

### Hypotheses: 

* Based on prior research, we think that Veterans will go to MHV or Google search by default to find their copayment charges.
  * Once on VA.gov, we think Veterans will expect to find their statements under the Health care hub, but they will resort to [Get your VA medical records](https://staging.va.gov/health-care/get-medical-records) or [Download your benefit letters](https://staging.va.gov/records/download-va-letters) under Records when they don't see a relevant link.
* We think that Veterans may expect to see benefit debts and copayment bills in separate places, but may prefer to see all money owed to the VA together in one place.
* We think that Veterans will struggle to interpret the Patient Statement in a few areas, including:
  * Account summary - what amount is due to avoid late charges, and by when?
  * Description - line items missing for previous balances
  * Payment options - what their options are for payment
* We think that Veterans may conceptualize their statements as either 'debts' or 'bills' or find them interchangeable

## Method

### What method of research are you planning?

In-person, moderated sessions conducted on Zoom

* Directed interview
* "Usability test" of the current paper statements

#### Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?

* We have learned some about Veterans and their copayment debts through our previous research for the "Debt Letters MVP," so we will only be looking to have Veterans answer some basic questions about their experiences in the past before moving on to the task portions of the session.
* By testing the current paper statements, we're hoping to determine where Veterans struggle most when deciphering their debt and what details matter to them most.

#### Where are you planning to do your research? 

Online, through Zoom

#### What will you be testing? 

Veteran Patient Statements

## Participants and Recruitment

### Participant criteria: 

What are you looking for in a participant?

#### Primary criteria / Must have:

* We would like a total of 15 participants scheduled; our goal is to conduct 8 sessions, minimum
* Participants must be comfortable with discussing their experiences with VA Health Care copayments in the past:
  * Which of the following describes you?
    1. I use VA health care and pay for copays (Qualify 9 participants)
    2. I use VA health care and do not pay for copays (proceed to next question)
    3. I do not use VA health care (Disqualify)
  * Why do you not pay for copayment charges? (Qualify 6 total)
    1. My disability rating is 50% or higher (Qualify up to 4)
    2. My secondary insurance covers my copayment (Qualify up to 4)
    3. I asked for financial assistance (Qualify if available)
    4. None of the above (Qualify if available)
* Please confirm participants have Zoom downloaded prior to the session and they know how to screen share

#### Secondary criteria / Would like to have

* At least 1 woman
* At least 1 person of color
* At least 1 participant 35 or under and 1 participant over 55
* At least one person that does not have a college degree (to include enlisted Vets)
* At least one person that has no college experience 
* At least one person who lives in a rural or remote area
* At least one person who lives in a major metropolitan area
* At least one participant that has identified cognitive impairments and/or functional disabilities. Examples of diagnoses that may align with this would be Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), autism, and vertigo. Other conditions may be aphasia, dyslexia, dyscalculia, distractibility, memory loss, reading difficulties, low tolerance for cognitive overload, and intellectual/adaptive functioning challenges such as learning and problem-solving.
* At least one non-native English speaker
* At least one person who uses assistive technology (AT) such as specialized keyboards

## When?

### Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 

(IF you are using the research recruiting contract, please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote, 2+ weeks for in person.)

* April 22 - April 28

### When will the thing you are testing be ready?

Interview and Mural board only - [conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/Debt%20Resolution/Medical_Copays/research/apr-2021/conversation-guide.md), [Mural board](https://app.mural.co/t/vsa8243/m/vsa8243/1618248028269/7aa091d366c1be42973a5a743c0a2d918e586cad)

### Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? 

(This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours. Specify if you want Perigean to schedule the sessions with buffer time (15 minutes recommended) to allow for participants who can't make it on time, or if you might go over time.

* Up to 1 hour, 30 minute buffer between sessions

### Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? 

Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S. Specify how much time you want between sessions, if any.

* Thursday, April 22; 9:30 - 4:30pm EST
* Friday, April 23; 9:30 - 4:30 EST
