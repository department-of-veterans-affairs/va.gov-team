## Goals

With this research, we wanted to determine where Veterans expect to interact with their copayments online, and what could be improved in a digital representation of the Veteran Patient Statements. 

## Research methodology

We completed remote, moderated interviews and "usability tests" of current statements.

## Who we spoke with

* 11 total participants (5 men, 4 women, 2 preferred not to say; ages 25 to 74)
  * 2 paid copays for VA care prior to COVID
  * 2 have paid for VA copays in the past, but don't anymore
  * 7 do not pay copays for VA care due to disability rating or service-connection
* 8 were from major metro areas while 2 were from rural or remote areas

## Research questions

* Where do Veterans expect to find and interact with their VA copayments?
  * If on MHV or eBenefits, what would they be looking for and where do they expect to find it?
  * If on VA.gov, what would they be looking for and where do they expect to find it?
* Do Veterans expect to find all of their money owed to the VA in a single tool?
  * Does their expectation match their ideal?
* How do Veterans conceptualize the mailed Veteran Patient Statements? As debts, bills, something else?
* How can we improve Veteran Patient Statements?

## Answers to our research questions

### Where do Veterans expect to find and interact with their VA copayments?

#### Most Veterans' first instincts are to call when they need to find information about their copays, but they do expect to be able to access that information online.

When asked what they'd do after misplacing their statement, Veterans would:

- Call VA (7)
    - VA facility (4)
    - VA hotline (3)
- Search online (4)
- Wait for another letter to show up (2), or 
- Go to their VA facility in person (1)  

#### Veterans often rely on the portals they use most frequently when searching for copayment details online.

* MyHealtheVet / "Blue Button" (4)
  * Many Veterans use MHV for other health care tasks, so they were comfortable with it; "Best way \[to find info for money owed\] is through MHV. That's where I go for my prescriptions, so it would make sense for billing too."
  * Veterans like having all of their health care accessible to them in one spot
  * Veterans did not mind being redirected to VA.gov from MyHealtheVet
* eBenefits (4)
  * Many Veterans interact with VA primarily through eBenefits, and use it as a jumping-off point for VA wayfinding, even when the task is related to health
    * "The VA has created a labyrinth, so many doors opening into the same room."
    * "I just figured it would be connected or there'd be a link I'd be able to follow. Kind of like Alice in Wonderland, going down the rabbithole. I thought there'd be something that'd say, 'Go this way' or prompt to look at another website."
  * One Veteran navigated to "VA Letters"
  * Several Veterans expected to see a link on the eBenefits homepage that said, "Pay my bills"
* VA.gov (2)
  * Many Veterans do not visit VA.gov directly often, and don't see it as a place to initiate tasks with VA.
* Google (2)
  * "Pay debts to the VA" → [Debtman](https://www.va.gov/debtman/)
  * "VA debt repayment" → ['Pay your VA copay bill'](https://www.va.gov/health-care/pay-copay-bill/)
* AccessVA (2)
  * Two participants were aware of the newer Veteran Patient Statement tool in AccessVA, but only one had used it and she wished it was in MHV instead.  

#### When searching VA.gov for information about money owed to VA, Veterans often search within the lens of the hub they're dealing with.

When asked where to find copayment information starting from the VA.gov homepage, Veterans:

* Scrolled to the VA.gov Home Quadrants (5)
  * Looked under the "Health care" hub, but was not able to find a relevant link (5)
  * Looked under the "Records" hub, but was not able to find a relevant link (3)
  * "View your payment history" under disability and education hubs (4)
* Used search (3)
  * "Owe" → ['Manage your VA debt'](https://www.va.gov/manage-va-debt/)
  * "Billing" → ['Pay your VA copay bill'](https://www.va.gov/health-care/pay-copay-bill/)
  * "Health care" → ['VA Health care'](https://www.va.gov/health-care/)
* Used primary navigation (1)
  * One participant expected "Pay bill" or "Pay copay" under 'VA Benefits and Health Care'

When asked more broadly about other debts a Veteran might owe, Veterans:

* Looked to the hubs that the scenario dealt with (e.g. for education debts, looked in the education hub)

Several Veterans stated that they would look for a section on the homepage with the topic of "Financial" or "Billing" that would house all matters related to money.  

#### Veterans looked for a variety of keywords when searching for a pathway to copayment information, but primarily looked for "bill." 

* "Billing" / "Pay my bill" / "Pay bill" / "Pay bill here" (5)
* "Debt" / "VA debt" / "Pay your VA debt" (2)
* "Accounts" (1)
* "Money owed" (1)
* "Pay Copay" (1)
* "Payment" (1)

### Do Veterans expect to find all of their money owed to the VA in a single tool?

#### Veterans overwhelmingly expected to find all money owed to VA within a single tool despite the various approaches they took while finding that tool.

While discussing what they'd expect to find when looking for money they owed to VA, Veterans:

* Explicitly stated that they'd expect to find all money owed to VA in a single place (7)
* Expected to see debt-related links in the education, disability, and health care hubs on VA.gov's home page, but it wasn't clear whether or not they expected those links to direct to the same tool (2)
* 2 didn't care about debts besides health care, but 1 had searched for 'billing' in general  

Quotes:

* "I'd expect to contact one VA organization and be able to pay all of my VA debts."
* "So like if you have any payments you owe, I would think regardless what they were for they'd be in some central location."

#### Veterans expected to see all money owed to VA and all money received from VA in the same location. 

* Multiple gravitated towards the 'View your payment history' links under the disability and education hubs on the homepage (4)  

Quotes:

* "Makes sense that payments incoming and outgoing would be under the same umbrella. By the terminology payment history would determine incoming and outcoming."
* "I guess if I'm looking for payment history, I'm gonna be looking for something that shows money coming and going so to speak."

## 

### How do Veterans conceptualize the mailed Veteran Patient Statements? As debts, bills, something else?

#### Overwhelmingly, Veterans conceptualize the Veteran Patient Statements as 'Bills'

When asked what a piece of mail detailing their VA medical charges would be called, participants said:

* VA Bill / Billing Statement (7)
* Explanation of Benefits (2)
* Money owed (1)
* Invoice (1)
* Conspiracy (1)

#### Veterans may relate medical bills to debt, either as a precursor or subset of their debt

When asked to locate information about their copay statements:

* Several participants navigated to 'Manage your VA debt' when searching for their copayment statements
* Several participants stated that their bill would be sent to collections if they don't pay.
* Several participants explicitly looked for 'debt' as a keyword when searching for money owed to VA (4)

## 

### What pain points exist with the current Veteran Patient Statements?

#### Veterans expect their charges to be easily understood and verifiable.

* Most Veterans stated that they would review the charges to ensure that the charges were correct.
* Several Veterans felt that the descriptions were dense and confusing.
* If the charges were incorrect or they had questions, most Veterans would call their facility.
* Several participants noted that they would expect explanations of their charges; one participant said they would like a place where they can see their eligibility and copayment fees for various visits.

Quotes:

* "I'm gonna check if the previous balance is correct. I'd call them if not."
* "Just looks like a lot of gobbledegoo"
* "It looks like the physician is next to the quantity. Why do we have 30 physicians?"

#### Veterans overwhelmingly wanted to see their previous charges itemized

* While most understood the charges in the first bill's description section, many were confused that the second letter only listed the admin/interest fee for the unpaid previous bill (6)
  * Multiple participants said it would be easier to understand the second letter if the previous charges carried over to the second statement (5)
  * One participant thought the second bill was only for an admin/interest fee and that the previous charges had been paid off
  * One participant said that if he hadn't received the first bill he'd have no idea what the second bill was for

Quotes:

* "This one doesn't say anything at all. It only tells me my previous balance and the interest charge, but it doesn't tell me why I have to pay all of this. It would be nice if they wrote it down again to remind me of my previous balance."
* "There's no explanation of it. If I was in the middle of moving, and I didn't get the letter or I shredded it, I'd have no idea what this is about."
* "I guess it would be weird to get something like this. I guess I wouldn't know why I was getting an interest I guess. I know it says previous balance but you don't know where it came from."

#### Veterans felt that the supporting documentation was overwhelming, but useful.

* Most participants felt the supporting documentation was too dense and overwhelming (8)
* Many wouldn't refer to the extra pages at all unless they had questions about their bill (5)
  * One said they'd rather call customer service than read the pages
  * One would prefer to go to VA.gov to search for an answer than read the pages
* A couple participants thought the pages were too 'government-ese' and harmful to Veterans

Quotes:

* "A typical Veteran is going to get the bill, read the first page, and shred it or pay it. All this is good to know, but I don't think 99.9% of people look at these pages."
* "I don't know who would go through this."
* "I feel like I could find the answer to what I was wondering about quicker if I just searched it on my own."  

#### It was not clear to some Veterans what amount was due, by when, and what would happen if they didn't pay.

When asked what amount would be due by the due date, 

* Most participants expected the full balance to be due by the listed date (7)
* Some participants speculated that the previous balance would be due (2)
* Some participants weren't sure what the amount due was (2)
* One participant would, "Pay $5 and see what happens."  (1)  

#### Statement terminology was overall very understandable for Veterans

* Nearly all Veterans were able to accurately describe what 'Previous balance,' 'Payments received,' 'New charges,' and 'Balance' meant in the context of the bill.
* Some Veterans weren't sure if "INTEREST / ADM CHARGE' corresponded to 'LATE CHARGES' on supporting documents (2)

---

## Other key findings  

* While navigating the copay bill process on Pay.gov, multiple participants were unsure what their account number was and where to find it. 
* Several Veterans expected to see information related to their insurance contributions in the context of a copay bill. 
* Several participants were not aware of their resolution options outside of paying, and would like to see that information emphasized. 
* Several participants have struggled with receiving bills from community care providers and not being able to resolve them easily.
