# Unified Solutions for VA Copay and Debt Management: Insights from Veterans

*Debt Portal Copayment Enhancement Veteran Research Readout, April 2021*

## tl;dr (too long, didn’t read)
Veterans expect a unified, user-friendly digital tool to manage VA copayments and debts but currently face confusion and inefficiencies in accessing and understanding this information.

## What we did
The Digital Services Veterans Affairs (DSVA) team conducted remote, moderated interviews and usability tests in April 2021. The objective was to understand where Veterans expect to interact with their copayments online and how to improve the digital representation of Veteran Patient Statements.

## Key insights
- **Veterans expect all debts in a single tool.** ([Line 114](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/a5733ac79b4b3cdeaf6f93820958780e03a5b1c7/products/Debt%20Resolution/Medical_Copays/research/apr-2021/readout.md#L114))
  - Quote: “I’d expect to contact one VA organization and be able to pay all of my VA debts.”
- **Medical statements are primarily seen as bills.** ([Line 174](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/a5733ac79b4b3cdeaf6f93820958780e03a5b1c7/products/Debt%20Resolution/Medical_Copays/research/apr-2021/readout.md#L174))
  - Quote: “This one doesn’t say anything at all. It only tells me my previous balance and the interest charge, but it doesn’t tell me why I have to pay all of this.”
- **Online navigation is fragmented.** ([Line 60](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/a5733ac79b4b3cdeaf6f93820958780e03a5b1c7/products/Debt%20Resolution/Medical_Copays/research/apr-2021/readout.md#L60))
  - Quote: “The VA has created a labyrinth, so many doors opening into the same room.”
- **Confusion over charges and documentation is common.** ([Line 161](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/a5733ac79b4b3cdeaf6f93820958780e03a5b1c7/products/Debt%20Resolution/Medical_Copays/research/apr-2021/readout.md#L161))
  - Quote: “I’m gonna check if the previous balance is correct. I’d call them if not.”
- **Terminology is understandable, but clarity on due amounts is lacking.** ([Line 196](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/a5733ac79b4b3cdeaf6f93820958780e03a5b1c7/products/Debt%20Resolution/Medical_Copays/research/apr-2021/readout.md#L196))
  - Quote: “Most participants expected the full balance to be due by the listed date.”

## Between the lines
The reliance on MyHealtheVet and eBenefits highlights a need to integrate copayment tools more seamlessly into platforms Veterans already use. There’s also a missed opportunity to educate Veterans about resolution options beyond payment, such as dispute processes.

## Yes, but
While a single tool for all debts is desirable, the complexity of integrating VHA copayments and VBA debts may require significant backend coordination and stakeholder alignment.

## Why it matters
This research underscores the importance of aligning VA digital services with Veterans' expectations for clarity and accessibility, directly supporting VA's commitment to improving the Veteran experience and OCTO's key results for enhancing digital tools.

## What’s next
- Develop a unified tool for managing VHA and VBA debts.
- Streamline navigation from MyHealtheVet, eBenefits, and VA.gov.
- Simplify statement descriptions and emphasize resolution options for community care bills.
