## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is \[NAME\] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about how you interact with your VA health care, including your experience with copayments if you get them.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

* This entire session should take up to an hour. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We want to hear about your experience with VA health care to inform us as we bring copayments online. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
* During this session, we'll be doing two things:
  * First, I'll start by asking you a few questions about how you interact with VA health care. I'll ask you to share your screen so I can follow along with you. I can give you instructions on how to share your screen if you need them!
  * For the second half of the session, I'll send you a link to look at some fake copayment statements similar to ones you might have previously received in the mail. We want to learn what parts of these statements work for you, and areas that could be improved. 
* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
  * If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

[Start recording.]

* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

* Tell me a little bit about how you currently use VA health care.
* Tell me about your past experiences with VA health care copayments.
  * Do you get statements for VA Health Care?
  * How do you receive them?
* Do you have any other insurance plans for your health care? (Can prompt private insurance, Medicare/Medicare, TRICARE if they seem unsure)
  * (If yes) Tell me about how you manage your \_\_\_\_ insurance. (Can prompt about viewing statements/explanation of benefits online, etc.)
* What sort of communications do you receive from the VA?
  * What would you change about how the VA contacts you?

## Interview (Wayfinding) - 20 minutes

* Imagine you received a letter in the mail about owing money to the VA, but you've misplaced it, what would you do?
  * Is there some other way you'd prefer to find this information?
* (If they haven't mentioned one of the online formats) Let's imagine there's a place online where you can access this information. Tell me what that looks like for you. 
* MyHealtheVet
  * Talk to me about how you'd find that information
  * (If they mention logging in, ask if they'd be comfortable signing in)
  * (Redirect to VA.gov afterwards)
* eBenefits
  * Talk to me about how you'd find that information
  * (If they mention logging in, ask if they'd be comfortable signing in)
  * (Redirect to VA.gov afterwards)
* VA.gov 
  * What do you normally come to VA.gov for?
  * Talk to me about how you'd find that information
  * (If they mention logging in, ask if they'd be comfortable signing in)
  * What keywords are you expecting to see?
* Let's say you had an appointment at your local VA medical center and want to see the charges for your visit. What would you do to find that information?
  * How does this experience compare finding information about money you owe to the VA?

**Things to watch for**
* Where do Veterans expect to interact with their VA copayments?
  * If on MHV or eBenefits, what would they be looking for and where do they expect to find it?
  * If on VA.gov, what would they be looking for and where do they expect to find it?
* How do Veterans conceptualize the mailed Veteran Patient Statements? As debts, bills, something else?
* Do Veterans expect to find their statements in their own area on VA.gov or among other VA debts/bills?
  * Does their expectation match their ideal?

## VPS Activity - 25 min

Alright, I want you to imagine that you are in the following scenario:

* You are a Veteran who went to a VA medical center in February for a routine checkup. In March, you went back to the VA medical center to hav a few routine tests done and you refilled your medication. Today, a couple weeks later, you received a piece of mail detailing your VA healthcare charges.
  * In a word or two, what would you call that piece of mail?
  * What do you expect that mail to include?
* I'm going to send you a link in the chat. Since you're sharing your screen, there should be a bar at the top, hover over the "More" icon, then open Chat in the dropdown. Go ahead and click that link when you're ready.

\[Send link in chat: [https://preview.uxpin.com/a0f7710002cf5f0d104c63ea77f2c7112f0853f0\#/pages/138400205/simulate/no-panels?mode=i](https://preview.uxpin.com/a0f7710002cf5f0d104c63ea77f2c7112f0853f0#/pages/138400205/simulate/no-panels?mode=i)\]

* How familiar are you with this letter from the VA?
* What are/were your first impressions of this letter?
* Can you tell me what you owe, based on this letter?

  * What do you think "Payments Received" means?
  * What do you think "New charges" means?

  * How much do you need to pay by that date?
  * What do you think will happen if you don't pay by that date?

* So let's say you misplaced the letter from before and forgot to pay the bill. A month later, you receive this letter in the mail. 
* Can you tell me what's different about this statement compared to the last one we were looking at?

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans, so thank you for your time.

Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
