## Goals

With this research, we wanted to test the medical copay tool's MVP designs to validate if our design decisions correlate to how Veterans expect to be able to interact with their VA copay balances online. 

## Research methodology

We completed remote, moderated interviews alongside task-based usability testing with a UXPin prototype optimized for mobile. 

## Who we spoke with 

* 10 total participants (5 women, 5 men; ages 35-74)
  * All participants use VA health care 
  * 7 have received bills for copays and/or prescriptions in the past
  * 2 have previously received bills directly from a community care provider
  * 2 no longer pay for VA health care due to either disability rating increase or requesting hardship determination 
  * 1 had copays waived due to hardship determination in the past but now pays copays
* All participants were on mobile devices
  * 5 were on Android
  * 5 were on iPhone

## Research questions

* Is the online tool card effective at communicating the tool and its use to the Veteran?
* Do Veterans understand the concept of a referred charge and what to do about it?
* Do Veterans understand how their charges and payments contribute to a balance for each facility?
* How do Veterans expect to be able to interact with the charges and payments table, if at all?
* Are the charge details included in the table relevant and complete?
* Do Veterans understand how to view and resolve their bills?
* Are Veterans able to find all of the relevant information they need about their debt?
* Do Veterans understand their options for resolving their bills?
* Do Veterans understand who to call if they have questions?
* What do Veterans think about the wizard as a means to find resolution?

## Answers to our research questions

### Is the online tool card effective at communicating the tool and its use to the Veteran?

Note: This is a component that was tested to potentially add to the experimental design system 

Most Veterans understood that the online tool card would lead them into an online tool

* 7 successfully found the CTA button in the card to navigate into the tool 
  * 2 were directed into the tool after they were unsure what to do next to view their copay bills
  * 1 was unable to view the prototype due to technical difficulties
* Most read the card to see what they could do within the tool 

> "Like, any time I request prescriptions whenever I get a prescription and I have a copay I can use this tool to go in there to pay my copay instead of having to send it in the mail which would be handy" - P4

There were various expectations about what could be accomplished within the tool itself

* Most expected to be able to view their copay balances and pay any copay bills they have 
* A couple Veterans expected to see their copay rates in order to forecast the charges they might incur for future office visits; one mentioned a copay calculator tool 
* A couple Veterans stated they wouldn't be able to use the tool because they don't pay copays
  * 1 who pays for prescriptions wondered if they'd be able to view those within the tool 

### Do Veterans understand the concept of a referred charge and what to do about it?

Yes; Veterans understood what referred charges meant and the alert was often the first thing Veterans noticed when arriving in the tool. 

This is a component that was tested as part of the experimental design system

* Some clicked on the alert to read more while others moved on to looking at either their balance details or resolution options
* Of the 9 participants who viewed the prototype:
  * 8 understood what a referred charge was and how to resolve it
  * 1 participant understood that they owed money but struggled to find information about how to resolve it 
* Several participants were interested in seeing the specific charges that were referred for collection 

> "I'd want a link to the collection statement that says what the original charges were, the interest was, and the late charges. I want to see everything laid out to see what they're charging $130.00 for." - P1

### Do Veterans understand how their charges and payments contribute to a balance for each facility?

Yes; most Veterans understood that balances were split by VA facility and several could pinpoint why, based on their experiences.

* Some liked that balances were split by facility because: 
  * They've been to multiple VA facilities
  * They liked seeing what charges they owe to each facility 
* 1 initially didn't scroll down far enough on the page to see that there were balances for multiple facilities 
* 1 didn't initially notice the 'View bill details' link and wondered what the charges for each balance were
* 1 didn't like that balances were split by facility and expected to see a total balance that they could pay all at once 

> "I think that's a really good idea because in my own case I used a VA in \[state\] and I've used the \[state\] VA and at one point I had copays from both facilities. To be able to see all of those on one page would be really helpful." - P2

> "I would hope they'd be shown in one location. I would pay that one location." - P9 

### How do Veterans expect to be able to interact with the charges and payments table, if at all? Are the charge details included in the table relevant and complete?

Veterans expect to be able to interact with the charges and payments table in different ways 

* Many said they would review the table to verify that the charges were correct
* A couple Veterans stated that the information in the table was complicated or jumbled
* Multiple expected the dates within the table to correspond to appointment dates 
* 1 thought the table's data correlated with one statement 

> "...to me it's like looking at a statement or transactions without having to open each statement, which is kind of nice. I like that only 6 are shown, because it would take forever to find a particular statement..." - P10

### Do Veterans understand how to view and resolve their bills?

Yes; most Veterans understood how to view and resolve their bills 

* 7 successfully navigated into the tool and viewed their balance details 
  * 1 preferred calling than viewing their bills online; they were redirected into the tool
  * 1 was unable to find the sign-in CTA 
* 7 successfully found information about their balance details and resolution options 
  * 1 successfully viewed the balance details, but needed to be directed to the 'Request help' action link 
  * 1 successfully viewed the balance details and selected the 'Resolve your copay bills' action link but struggled to find resolution information using the wizard

> "It's helpful, especially for people who are struggling right now financially and mental-health wise. It's helpful to have that all there so that people don't have to go look for it." - P1 (talking about the wizard)

### Are Veterans able to find all of the relevant information they need about their debt?

Some Veterans experienced difficulties interacting with the 'balance details' page

* Some struggled to find the balance due date
  * Veterans often looked for the due date around the charges and payments table; however, that information was at the top of the screen
* Most understood the facility's balance amount 
  * 1 participant was unsure and calculated the balance based on the table; they stated the balance was $360 instead of $300
* Most found the due date, however multiple were unsure what amount was due by that due date 

> "Uh, let's see here. (Scrolls down, scrolls back up) I wouldn't think you'd have to pay all of it in full. Well, if you can't pay it in full then you'd probably have to call to see if you could make a payment plan." - P4

### Do Veterans understand their options for resolving their bills?

While most Veterans understood their options for resolving their bills, some struggled to find to find that information 

* 5 understood all the options available to resolve their balance
* 1 specified all the options available but later on mentioned that they were unsure who to contact for steps such as filling out the FSR and appealing the VA's decision on a request
* 1 suspected their options but didn't confirm the options while interacting with the prototype
* 1 thought their only option was to pay the balance 
* 1 struggled with understanding their options through using the wizard
  * They were unable to find an address to mail their payment 
  * They struggled to find the FSR using the wizard's questions, but eventually found it at the top of the page 

### Do Veterans understand who to call if they have questions?

Veterans were generally able to identify numbers they would call with questions, but it wasn't always clear that they understood what those different numbers corresponded to

* 4 explicitly differentiated which number to call depending on the question
  * 1 wasn't confident that they would get the help they needed if they called
  * 1 mentioned that they have a patient advocate that they'd call rather than the provided numbers
* 3 didn't specify which number(s) they'd call 
* 2 didn't have a clear understanding of who to call when  

> "I like the fact that they give the contact information for each individual facility in case you do have some questions" - P4

> "Pray to god because the Va isn't coming. I would call that [number] and hope that the person on the other end of the line is able to assist." - P3 

### What do Veterans think about the wizard as a means to find resolution?

Most Veterans functionally understood the wizard; however, it wasn't the method some used to find information about certain resolution options 

* Of those who were given a scenario to find information about requesting financial help:
  * 5 were able to successfully find the FSR within the wizard
  * 2 struggled to find the FSR through interacting with the wizard
  * 2 found the FSR via the link at the top of the page rather than by answering the wizard's questions
* A couple Veterans expressed interest in filling out the FSR online 
* Multiple participants found payment information on the 'balance details' page rather than by using the wizard 
  * 2 navigated back to the 'balance details' page from the wizard page to find this information

> "It's helpful, especially for people who are struggling right now financially and mental-health wise. It's helpful to have that all there so that people don't have to go look for it" - P1

## Other key findings

Veterans prefer receiving digital correspondence from VA; however, some like receiving mail correspondence as well

* 5 preferred digital correspondence 
  * 2 expected online correspondence either through VA.gov or My HealtheVet
  * 2 prefer receiving emails 
  * 1 would like texts, but thought they weren't secure so they brainstormed secure messaging through an app
* 3 like receiving mail correspondence
* 1 likes receiving phone calls directly from their doctor

## Recommendations 

* Rework the charges and payments table 
  * Explore ways to simplify table data to be more scannable. Potential solutions:
    * Condense descriptions 
    * Reduce labels
    * Minimize data columns on mobile / make transaction details interactive
  * List the balance amount and due date closer to the table / Support the 'Running tally' mental model.
  * Non-usability recommendation: Incorporate preliminary sort and filter functionality to test more goal-centric tasks with Veterans. This was not unearthed in usability, but we were unable to fully test our hypothesis that sorting and filtering charges is a necessary feature.
* Investigate the problem of transaction dates vs. the expectation of visit dates
* Provide clarification around the amount that's due by the due date and emphasize the resolution pathways when full payment can't be made.
* Display more information about the specific charges being sent for collection, non-phone contact methods if available, and what details Veterans should expect to have on-hand. 
* Include clarifying content that states that prescription bills are included in the tool 
* Support discovery of separate balances across facilities
* Evaluate the current use of the wizard as a primary navigation solution
