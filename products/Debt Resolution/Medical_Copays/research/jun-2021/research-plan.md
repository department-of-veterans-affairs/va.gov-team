# Research Plan for Debt Resolution Team, Medical Copayments Usability

As a designer I need to create a research plan to share with my team.

## Goals

### What product & team are you doing this research for?:

Debt Resolution Team's Medical Copays

### Background: 

Our team is working to bring VA medical copay bills (Veteran Patient Statements) to VA.gov. Currently, Veterans are able to access the last 6 months of their statements through AccessVA directly or by MyHealtheVet link to AccessVA. In our previous research study ([readout](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/Debt%20Resolution/Medical_Copays/research/apr-2021/readout.md#debt-portal-copayment-enhancement-veteran-research-readout)), we learned that Veterans do generally expect all money owed to the VA to be found in a central location. Due to the authenticated experience team not being ready to accommodate a more expansive "financial hub" as initially proposed, we are scaling the Copayments MVP back to be a standalone tool very similar to the existing benefits [Debt Portal tool](https://staging.va.gov/manage-va-debt/).  

With this round of research, we are looking to test a lower-fidelity mobile-view prototype of the Copayments MVP to gauge how well Veterans use the tool on mobile devices.

### Research questions: 

What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?

* Is the online tool card effective at communicating the tool and its use to the Veteran?
* Do Veterans understand the concept of a referred charge and what to do about it?
* Do Veterans understand how their charges and payments contribute to a balance for each facility?
* How do Veterans expect to be able to interact with the charges and payments table, if at all?
* Are the charge details included in the table relevant and complete?
* Do Veterans understand how to view and resolve their bills?
* Are Veterans able to find all of the relevant information they need about their debt?
* Do Veterans understand their options for resolving their bills?
* Do Veterans understand who to call if they have questions?
* What do Veterans think about the wizard as a means to find resolution?

### Hypotheses: 

* Veterans will find and understand the tool available on the content page
* Veterans may not fully understand the referred charges and may want to know more about which charges had been referred and what it means for them
* Veterans may like seeing their charges separated by facility
* Veterans may be confused why they can't pay their charges for all their facilities at once
* Veterans may miss the simpler link for viewing their balance details, then be confused why the wizard doesn't show more information about their balance
* Veterans will be able to find the information they need about their bill balances
* Veterans will be able to find and understand their options, but Veterans may be frustrated with the wizard

## Method

### What method of research are you planning?

Remote, moderated sessions conducted on Zoom

* Usability testing with a UXPin prototype designed for mobile

#### Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?

* Usability testing will help us validate both our research hypotheses and design assumptions as well as uncover additional gaps

#### Where are you planning to do your research? 

Online, through Zoom

#### What will you be testing? 

[UXPin Prototype](https://preview.uxpin.com/361636c369f65453b4880d1445911c4d9b869349#/pages/139878811/simulate/no-panels?mode=i)

## Participants and Recruitment

### Participant criteria: 

What are you looking for in a participant?

#### Primary criteria / Must have:

  * Up to 8 participants that receive VA health care copays
  * Up to 7 that do not receive VA health care copays
    1. Up to 4 with a disability rating of 50% or higher
    2. Up to 4 with secondary insurance that covers copayment
    3. Any that have asked for financial assistance
* Participants must be comfortable with discussing their past experiences with VA Health Care copayments
* Please screen participants based on these questions:
  * Which of the following describes you?
    1. I use VA health care and receive copays (Qualify 8 participants)
    2. I use VA health care and do not receive copays (proceed to next question)
    3. I do not use VA health care (Disqualify)
  * Why do you not receive copayment charges? (Qualify 7 total)
    1. My disability rating is 50% or higher (Qualify up to 4)
    2. My secondary insurance covers my copayment (Qualify up to 4)
    3. I asked for financial assistance (Qualify if available)
    4. None of the above (Qualify if available)
  * What kind of mobile (or tablet, if applicable) device do you use?
    1. Android
    2. iPhone
    3. Other (disqualify - too many variables for our prototypes)
  * Are you comfortable with joining the research session from your phone using the Zoom app?
    1. Yes (qualify)
