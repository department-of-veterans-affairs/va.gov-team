Before the session, send out the [observer instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/during-research/howto-observer-instructions.md) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [\#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).

In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute

In the Audio section, click the drop-down arrow and make sure "Play Entry/Exit Chimes" is unchecked

Check your \[screensharing setup\]

When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is \[NAME\] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about how you interact with your VA health care, including your experience with copayments if you get them.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

* This entire session should take up to an hour. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We want to hear about your experience with VA health care to inform us as we bring copayments online. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
* During this session, we'll be doing two things:
  * First, I'll start by asking you a few questions about how you interact with VA health care and copayments in the past.
  * For the second half of the session, I'll send you a link to a prototype that one of our teams created to show copayment bills online. The prototype we're looking at today is optimized for mobile - are you currently on a mobile device? 
* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
  * If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

Start recording.

* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

* Tell me a little bit about how you currently use VA health care.
* Tell me about your past experiences with VA health care copayments.
  * Do you get statements for VA Health Care?
  * How do you receive them?
* Have you ever received any other notice about owing money to the VA? 
  * \[If yes\] What was it for? How did you deal with it?
* What sort of communications do you receive from the VA?
  * What would you change about how the VA contacts you?

## Usability

* I'm going to send you a link in Zoom's chat feature. Go ahead and click that link when you're ready.

Send link in chat: https://preview.uxpin.com/361636c369f65453b4880d1445911c4d9b869349#/pages/140027243/simulate/no-panels?mode=i

Now please navigate back to Zoom and share your screen so I can follow along with you [Direct them to the 'Share content' button and 'Share screen' as needed].

What we're looking at now is a potential tool on VA.gov. Since it's a prototype, it may not always work like the real VA.gov does, so if there's anything you want to know more about or unsure about, let me know. If something doesn't work the way you expect, let me know what you expected it to do.

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans, so thank you for your time.

Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
