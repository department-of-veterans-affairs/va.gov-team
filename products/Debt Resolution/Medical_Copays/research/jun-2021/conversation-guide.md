When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is \[NAME\] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about how you interact with your VA health care, including your experience with copayments if you get them.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

* This entire session should take up to an hour. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We want to hear about your experience with VA health care to inform us as we bring copayments online. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
* During this session, we'll be doing two things:
  * First, I'll start by asking you a few questions about how you interact with VA health care and copayments in the past.
  * For the second half of the session, I'll send you a link to a prototype that one of our teams created to show copayment bills online. 
* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
  * If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

Start recording.

* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

* Tell me a little bit about how you currently use VA health care.
* Tell me about your past experiences with VA health care copayments.
  * Do you get statements for VA Health Care?
  * How do you receive them?
* Have you ever received any other notice about owing money to the VA? 
  * \[If yes\] What was it for? How did you deal with it?
* What sort of communications do you receive from the VA?
  * What would you change about how the VA contacts you?

## Usability

* I'm going to send you a link in Zoom's chat feature. Go ahead and click that link when you're ready.

\[Send link in chat: https://preview.uxpin.com/361636c369f65453b4880d1445911c4d9b869349\#/pages/139236640/simulate/no-panels?mode=i\] 

What we're looking at now is a potential tool on VA.gov. Since it's a prototype, it may not always work like the real VA.gov does, so if there's anything you want to know more about or unsure about, let me know. If something doesn't work the way you expect, let me know what you expected it to do. 

### Landing page

* What could you use this tool for? 
* What's an example of when you might use this tool?
  * Let's say you recently had a few appointments and refilled your medication, and now you want to check if you owe anything. What would be your next step from here?
  * What would you expect to see once you sign in?
* Go ahead and click sign in. You won't need to use your real account to sign in.

### Bill overview

* What  are we looking at here?
  * What stands out to you about this page?
  * What are your thoughts?
  * What is missing?
* If you were looking to take care of an outstanding bill from the Cedar Park VA Medical Center, what would your next step be?
  * \[If 'view bill details'\]
    * What do you expect to see there?
    * What do you want to do once you're there?
    * Go ahead and click that link.
  * \[If 'resolution' button'\]
    * What do you expect to see once you click on that button?
    * What do you want to be able to do once you're there?
    * Go ahead and click that button.

### Bill Detail Page

* Is this what you were expecting?
* What are we looking at?
* What do you owe, based on what you see on this page?
* When do you need to pay by?
* How much do you need to pay by that date?
* What do you think will happen if you don't pay by that date?
* Talk to me about the charges you see here.
  * What does this mean to you?
  * How would you normally do with this information?
  * If you had questions about these charges, what would you do?
* What do you think your options are to settle this debt?
* Do you have any questions about this page?
* What would you do next if you weren't able to pay this bill?

### Wizard

* What are we looking at?
* How does this compare to your expectations?
* Let's say you want to request financial help for the bill you received from the Cedar Park VA Medical Center. 
  * What would you do next?

### FSR card

  * What does this mean to you?
  * What would you do next?
  * What would you expect to see next?

* How do Veterans react to the wizard being the primary CTA from the summary page? The detail page?
* Are Veterans able to accurately interpret their charges?
* Do Veterans know what their options are for resolving the debt?
* Are Veterans able to easily navigate through the wizard?

* Is there anything that you're unsure about?
* Was there anything missing that you expected to see?
* How would you describe the web pages we looked at today, in a few words?
* Do you have any other thoughts on what we talked about today?

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans, so thank you for your time.

Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
