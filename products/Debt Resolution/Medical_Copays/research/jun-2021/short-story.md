# Simplifying Medical Copays for Veterans: Usability Study Insights

## TL;DR (Too Long, Didn’t Read)
This study evaluated the Medical Copay tool's MVP designs to ensure they meet Veterans' expectations for managing VA copay balances online.

## What We Did
The Digital Services Veterans Affairs (DSVA) team conducted remote, moderated interviews and task-based usability testing with 10 Veterans using a mobile-optimized UXPin prototype. The goal was to validate design decisions for the Medical Copay tool and understand how Veterans interact with it.

## Key Insights
- **[Veterans understand the tool but have diverse expectations.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/c0c4fc3b41ebc962df4ca645f2b9f171f2ac1356/products/Debt%20Resolution/Medical_Copays/research/jun-2021/readout.md#L57) (Line 57)**
  - Quote: “I can use this tool to go in there to pay my copay instead of having to send it in the mail.”
- **[Referred charges are noticeable but need more transparency.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/c0c4fc3b41ebc962df4ca645f2b9f171f2ac1356/products/Debt%20Resolution/Medical_Copays/research/jun-2021/readout.md#L78) (Line 78)**
  - Quote: “I want to see everything laid out to see what they’re charging $130.00 for.”
- **[Balancing clarity across facilities is appreciated but not universal.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/c0c4fc3b41ebc962df4ca645f2b9f171f2ac1356/products/Debt%20Resolution/Medical_Copays/research/jun-2021/readout.md#L91) (Line 91)**
  - Quote: “I would hope they'd be shown in one location. I would pay that one location.”
- **[The wizard navigation can be helpful but isn’t intuitive for all.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/c0c4fc3b41ebc962df4ca645f2b9f171f2ac1356/products/Debt%20Resolution/Medical_Copays/research/jun-2021/readout.md#L169) (Line 169)**
  - Quote: “It’s helpful… but I struggled to find the FSR using the wizard’s questions.”
- **[Digital correspondence is preferred, with some exceptions.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/c0c4fc3b41ebc962df4ca645f2b9f171f2ac1356/products/Debt%20Resolution/Medical_Copays/research/jun-2021/readout.md#L177) (Line 177)**
  - Quote: “I prefer emails, but I’d like texts if they were secure.”

## Between the Lines
The research highlights a gap between Veterans' mental models and the current tool design. Veterans expect intuitive interactions, such as viewing total balances or linking charges to visit dates, which the MVP design partially addresses.

## Yes, But
While many found the tool helpful, some struggled with navigation and clarity, particularly with the wizard and balance details. Simplifying these components could enhance usability.

## Why It Matters
This study aligns with the VA’s broader goal to improve Veterans’ digital experiences. By addressing these usability challenges, the tool can better support financial transparency and accessibility, contributing to OCTO KRs like increasing user satisfaction.

## What’s Next
- Simplify the charges and payments table to improve scannability.
- Clarify balance due dates and resolution pathways.
- Reevaluate the wizard’s role as a primary navigation tool.
- Test additional features like sorting, filtering, and online FSR submission.
