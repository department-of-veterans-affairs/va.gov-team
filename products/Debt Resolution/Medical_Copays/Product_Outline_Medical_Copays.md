# Debt Portal - Medical Copays MVP Product Outline
---

## Overview
Medical Copays MVP is the next product to meet the goal of unifying Veteran VA debt into a modern, consolidated and Veteran friendly experience similar to what a consumer may experience with Quicken Loans or Chase portals. The goal of unifying all Veteran debt into a single portal is to make it simple for the Veteran to understand, pay or settle any and all debts they may have with VA without having to distinguish between different agencies and processes. 

## Problem Statement
There are several problem hypothesis that is driving the development of this product:

 **1. Legislative Requirements** 

Veterans Fair Debt Notice Act of 2017 (H.R.3705)

[https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3705](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3705)

Summary

This bill directs the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to collaborate with Veterans service organizations to write a standard letter to be provided to individuals who owe debts to the VA. Such letter shall be written in plain language and shall include a notice of the debt and a clear explanation of:

(1)why the individual owes such money, and

(2) available options. The VA shall develop a method by which individuals may elect to receive debt notification letters by electronic means and shall ensure that the letter is delivered:

(1) by both standard mail and electronic means to individuals who have made such election, and

(2) only by standard mail to individuals who have not made such election.

The VA shall:

(1)notify Congress regarding the completion of such letter, and

(2) study and report to Congress on the process by which it notifies veterans of debt collection efforts

Veterans Benefits and Transition Act of 2018 (S.2248)

[https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2884](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2884)

Summary

This bill directs the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to collaborate with Veterans service organizations to write a standard letter to be provided to individuals who owe debts to the VA. Such letter shall be written in plain language and shall include a notice of the debt and a clear explanation of:

(1) why the individual owes such money, and

(2) available options.

The VA shall develop a method by which individuals may elect to receive debt notification letters by electronic means and shall ensure that the letter is delivered:

(1) by both standard mail and electronic means to individuals who have made such election, and

(2) only by standard mail to individuals who have not made such election.

 **2. Veteran Experience** 

Veterans receive a variety of debt letters from The Department of Veterans Affairs

1.These letters are confusing and unclear for Veterans

1. The letters can be generated from any number of places despite the fact they are all from what the Veteran perceives to be a single company or agency.  However, internally, The Department of Veterans Affairs operates in silos as it relates to debt management. There is debt collection from DMC, VBA, and VHA.  Veterans are required to pay different parts of the agency and follow different protocols dependent on the debt.

2. The burden is put on the Veteran to understand the differences in “internal” debt silos; rather than the agency owning the burden to create one concise letter with a one stop shop for Veterans to pay their debts to the agency. This will bring the agency in alignment with industry best practices and make debt collection more customer-centric.

 
## Desired User Outcomes

 - A veteran will be able to see their medical co-pay debt in a modern, well designed portal that is easy to use and understand
 - Veterans will be able to take next steps on their debt whether it is payments, assistance or a combination without the need to reach out to contact center. 



## Undesired User Outcomes

 - Create more confusion when debs are consolidated into a single portal 

## Desired Business Outcomes

 - Streamline Veteran's interaction with debt, so there is one face of VA
 - Decrease time to debt resolution whether it is payments or debt relief
 - Increase numbers of veteran's taking actions to their debt
 - Decrease numbers of veteran's debt go to collections

## Undesired Business Outcomes

 - Increase calls to contact center
 - Increase in resolution time
