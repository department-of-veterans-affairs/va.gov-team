**Notice of rights and responsibilities** (h3)

**Collection** (h4)

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is required to collect debts owed to the government. Action must be taken within sixty (60) days from the initial billing statement to pay your debt in full or establish a payment plan or your account may be referred for further collection action. You have the right to inspect and copy the records related to the debt. You also have the right to establish a payment plan. You have the right to submit a compromise offer. Collection action includes referring your delinquent balance to the Department of Treasury's Cross-Servicing Program and Treasury Offset Program, which will include offset of any federal and state payments to which you are entitled. This includes tax refunds, social security benefits and salary or retirement benefits. In addition, the Department of Treasury may refer your account to private collection agencies, which will result in additional fees and interest being added to your account. You may also be subject to garnishment of non-federal wages under Treasury's Administrative Wage Garnishment Program. Other collection actions include offset of any current or future VA benefits to which you may become entitled. We may also report your delinquent account to credit reporting agencies sixty (60) days from the date of the initial billing statement. Additional information can be found at: www.va.gov/healthbenefits/cost/.

These charges consist of interest and administrative fees at rates established each year. Interest will be charged from the date charges first appear on the statement. You can avoid these charges by making timely payments by the balance due date on the initial billing statement. A monthly administrative cost or collection fee will be added to your debt if, within thirty (30) days of the date of the statement on which charges first appear, full payment of the debt is not received or a repayment plan agreement is not approved. If an installment repayment plan is established and any installment is not received by the due date, the monthly administrative cost or collection fee will thereafter be charged until the debt is paid. Other collection costs may also be added to the debt if additional collection actions become necessary. 

**Waiver** (h4)
