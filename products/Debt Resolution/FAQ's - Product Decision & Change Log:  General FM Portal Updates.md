### FAQ's

## Pay.gov
- **Are we still going with a September 30th launch date?**
  - Answer
  - **I'm concerned about testing with Pay.gov. Do we know what that involves? Do we need to get on their calendar? Do we need to test with them at all? How long will this take?**
    - Answer
  - **Do we have general insight into personnel resources we will need from Pay.gov and if we need to book those ahead of time?**
    - Answer
  - **Devops systems need to be in place before we get outbound calls to pay.gov running. Do we know what things need to be in place? Are we worried about a devops SLA holding us up?**
    - Answer
  - **MOU review time. I have a ticket this sprint for filling out the MOU, we do not know how long this will take to be reviewed or what tasks could come out of this. Current belief is MOU will get us closer to getting IP addresses to provide to Pay.gov**
    - Answer
  - **Specifically regarding Copays and Pay.gov, there are 11 tickets for lighthouse copay data, my understanding is that we need to have this done before we integrate with Pay.gov. Rough estimate is 3 points per Lighthouse item being optimistic. Seems like there are not enough points in the sprints between now and September 30th to get this done.**
