# Study Design/methodology for pay.gov Hosted Collection Page: 


## Recommendation: 

- Testing usability with a fully responsive prototype or live staging environment 
- Scenario based testing: “Imagine you have the following debts and copays”
- Testing VHA copay payment path first _OR_ testing VHA copay payment path **and** VBA overpayment path in one study (TBD based on design progress and similarities or differences in constraints across individual payment streams)

## Measuring: 

**Trust (clarity + credibility + control)**

**Usability (ease of use)**

**Connectedness and cohesion from debt portal to payment process**

## Measuring: 

### Small variations that UX team is currently considering/concerned about: 

- Making bulk payments vs. making individual payments
- Following a similar payment process for VBA overpayments and copays (knowing these will be two separate cashflow and payment streams)
- Authenticating before making a payment - how user friendly does this feel? (consider staging environment if we want to test this)



### Think aloud prompts: 

You just got these two types of money owed to the VA (if testing 2 in 1): 


Task 1: Pay a copay

Task 2: Pay another debt

Probes during & after: Confidence, clarity, confusion

Final reflection: Preferences, frustrations, suggestions
