# Product Outline Pay.gov for Benefit Overpayment Debt Payments
---

## Overview
Establish a "hosted collection page" from pay.gov to the va.gov debt portal to streamline the Veteran experience by enabling them to make payments for benefit overpayment debts without navigating away from the va.gov financial management experience. 

## Problem Statement
Currently Veterans managing their debts on our platform must navigate to an external website (pay.gov) to complete payments. This context switching leads to drop-off, confusing and an inconsistent user experience. There is a little visibility into how Veterans interact with the payment process once they leave our platform, making it difficult to optimize performance or troubleshoot issues. 

In addition, the VA Debt Management Center (DMC) will be deprecating the pay.va.gov site and would like to process payments through a pay.gov integration. While this solution will greatly improve the Veteran experience as described above, it will also provide a means for DMC to shift payments from the pay.va.gov process and ultimately eliminate that functionality. 

## Desired User Outcomes
- Veterans can initiate and complete debt payments directly from va.gov debt portal site without being redirected to pay.gov
- Veterans feel secure and confident in the payment process.
- The flow feels intuitive, quick, and personalized to the type of debt they are managing.

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Veterans get confused or drop off mid-process due to unclear interfaces or payment errors. 
- Veterans feel insecure about entering payment details due to lack of branding or visual consistency.
- Veterans encounter technical issues without clear paths to resolution.

## Desired Business Outcomes
- Overpayment Debt Payments are successful being processed via new pay.gov hosted collection page
- Reduced call center calls related to payment questions or issues. 
- Enhanced data visibility and reporting on Veteran payment behavior. 
- Improved Veteran satisfaction and retention for the debt management portal.

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Low adoption of the hosted payment solution due to poor UX or technical issues.
- Increased support costs due to unclear flows or errors.   
- Failure to meet compliance/security standards in integration.
- Failed payment processing due to errors or poor implementation.
