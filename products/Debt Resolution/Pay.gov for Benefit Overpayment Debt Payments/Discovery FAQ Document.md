## Discovery FAQ Document for Pay.gov for Benefit Overpayment Debt Payments
**Context:** _Information and question/answers will be collected to better define initiative as we learn more during all phases of development. Please number any questions for easy reference._

---
**1. What are the required features that pay.va.gov provides that pay.gov must add in order for us to transition to that platform and to sunset pay.va.gov?**
- Pay.va.gov verifies that DMC has an active debt before accepting a payment
- Pay.va.gov will reject payment attempts if there is a mismatch with DMC and indicates for user to call DMC.
- Pay.va.gov has a prepopulated drop down with deductions codes for users to choose.

 **2. When do pay.gov transactions appear in the VA DMC accounts?**
- TBD

 **3. What will a Veteran see when a payment is in 'pending' state?**
- TBD

**4. Can we pre-fill data for Veterans that they normally have to type out themselves on pay.va.gov?** 
- This is a recurring issue that Veterans find frustrating when having to make a payment externally.

Answer from 4/24 meeting with team, Bob, and Denise: 
> It sounds like this will be possible, particularly for one of the use cases

**5. Is there documentation on design guidelines for this hosted page?** 
- Are there examples available of other hosted pages?
- How much can we alter on this hosted page?

Answer from 4/24 meeting with team, Bob, and Denise: 
> There is documentation from pay.gov (30 pages) that provides examples.
> We can still begin ideating the best user flow for Veterans (data structuring aside)

**6. Will there be still be an unauthenticated way to pay for Veterans who learn about a payment due from a letter in the mail?** 
- Logging in to pay a bill may impede a Veteran's ability to resolve a copay or overpayment.

Answer from 4/24 meeting with team, Bob, and Denise: 
> It sounds like there is flexibility around this, UX thinks ability for unauthenticated payments is important

**7. What is the MVP amount of information to collect in order to process a payment?** 

So far, there are 5 steps (pages) to 
collect payment from Veterans for copays. 
> Is it possible to consolidate these 5 pages on one hosted page?

**8. From a UI/UX perspective, will we need two different interfaces, one for pay.va.gov experience and one for pay.gov?**

**9. Pay.va.gov uses pay.gov under the hood? If so, do we have a contac there?

**10. How do we support/do we support paying multiple debts with one payment? Seems like pay.va.gov just uses an account number to associate a payment with a veteran? In fact, how do we even associate a single debt to a payment?

**11. It looks like pay.gov sends emails including confirmation and recurring payment reminders. Are there any others? For example, what happens if a recurring payment method goes bad?

**12. How does DMC find out about payments made?

**13. Is there any particular reason we are not using "non-interactive services"? Just curious. Seems like the Hosted collection approach has been chosen already.

**14. Who was the latest integration? Peace corps? Is there another example with a payment being tied to an entity like in our case possibly a debt? How long did the PeaceCorps/latest integration take?

**15. Do we need to store anything like the tracking ID?
