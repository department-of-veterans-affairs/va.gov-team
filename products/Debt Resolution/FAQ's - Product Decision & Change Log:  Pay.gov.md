  - **Specifically regarding Copays and Pay.gov, there are 11 tickets for lighthouse copay data (just for backend), my understanding is that we need to have this done before we integrate with Pay.gov. Rough estimate is 3 points per Lighthouse item being optimistic. Seems like there are not enough points in the sprints between now and September 30th to get this done.**
