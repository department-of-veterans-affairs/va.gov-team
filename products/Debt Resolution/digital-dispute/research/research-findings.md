## Research Goals

The purpose of this research is to find out:

**As a unified, connected experience:**

### 1. Navigation, wayfinding, preexisting mental models

  

- How do Veterans navigate and find information in the intro pages all the way to the digital dispute form?

  

- How do their preexisting mental models inform their experience navigating?

  

**As distinct products:**

### 2. Usability & Comprehension

*“Wizard” / intro page and R&S page*

  
- How easily can Veterans navigate and find information that pertains to their debt situation?

  

- To what extent does the provided information regarding options for their situation prove helpful?

  

- Do they understand the paths available to them and the actions they need to take based on the information provided in the wizard?

  

- What mental models do Veterans have around the resolution options as they pertain to their unique situation?

  

*Digital Dispute*

  

- How easily can Veterans understand the option of digital dispute based on how it is explained on R&S page and in the form?

  

- How easily can Veterans navigate the form?

  

- What, if any concerns are there?

  

### 3. Mental Models: How helpful is the information provided based on their prior knowledge and experiences, if any?

## Research Questions

1.  Understand baseline & mental models: What experience, if any, do Veterans have with seeking debt relief and contesting VBA charges? What channels have they used to understand what they need to do? How easy is it for them to understand what they need to do through the information supplied in the 'Wizard' (R&S page) in contrast to what they have done previously?
    

  

2.  Understand Navigation & Wayfinding: How easy is it for Veterans to navigate the Manage VA Debt page, “Options to request help with VA debt” R&S page (“Wizard”), FSR intro page, Digital Dispute form debt portal, from the intro pages all the way to finding the information they need?
    

  

3.  Measuring: time to complete tasks, error rates
    

  

4.  Understand Findability & Wayfinding: How easy is it for Veterans to find the digital dispute form? (findability)
    

  

5.  Measuring: time to complete tasks
    

  

6.  Understand Findability & Wayfinding: Given that there are 2 paths Veterans can take to find the dispute form, which one do most Veterans take to find the dispute form? (this will be a task, and we will measure time on task)
    

  

7.  Understand Comprehension: How understandable is the information on the “Options to request help with VA debt” R&S page?
    

  

8.  Understand Usability & Comprehension: How is navigation and understanding of the Digital Dispute form itself?
    

  

9.  Understand Navigation & Accessibility: How easy is it for Veterans using screen readers to navigate through the pages from intro pages to Digital Dispute form?
    

## Methodology

### Usability study

  

Primary focus: on navigation, wayfinding, mental models

  

Secondary focus: comprehension and mental models

### Location

  

We conducted hour-long (75 minutes for participants who utilized screen readers) remote moderated research sessions via Zoom on May 14–27, 2025.

  

Participants interacted with a prototype built on CodeSandbox: [https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt](https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt)

## Hypotheses and Conclusions


Scale:  "Maybe True", “Likely True”, “Definitely True”, “Likely False”, “Definitely False” or “Not enough information”
    
1.  Veterans (users in this study) may struggle to find the new “Options to request help with VA debt” R&S page (“Wizard”) and may have difficulty noticing the difference between this new page and other help/intro pages such as: Manage VA Debt page and FSR intro page:
    

**Likely false**

2.  Veterans will find the information on the 3 help/intro pages (Manage VA Debt page and FSR intro page) including the R&S page to be helpful:
    

**Likely true: helpful overall, some detail missing on R&S page**

3.  Veterans will be able to find the Digital Dispute form easily so long as they are able to find the R&S page:
    
**Likely true: some participants found the Dispute Form on the Manage VA Debt page**

4.  Veterans will view the experience of introductory pages to Digital Dispute form as part of one experience:

**Definitely true:** **the experience felt cohesive; no one commented on it feeling disconnected, likely due to the recurring content across different pages that created a sense of carryover**

5.  Veterans will be able to understand the Digital Dispute Form easily and without significant cognitive load demands:
    

**Definitely true**

6.  Veterans will be able to navigate through the Digital Dispute Form easily:
    

**Definitely true**

7.  Veterans (users in this study) may find an option to resolve or address their debt on the “Options to request help with VA debt” R&S page (“Wizard”) that is relevant to them and it may take them time to understand and find the option that is most relevant to them:
    

**Maybe true** 

 
## Key Findings


### 1. Usability of the Debt Portal as a connected experience:

> #### Overall, navigation and findability in the debt portal were excellent, regardless of prior familiarity with the debt portal interface. Participants understood the design elements on each page, they navigated between pages easily, and they found information easily.

### 2. Usability of the Resources & Support page: navigation and content architecture were intuitive

  
> #### Overall, participants found the Resources & Support page easy to navigate, and they liked that all of the information needed to seek resolution was on one page. The overall page hierarchy was intuitive to participants. All participants expanded the accordion with no issues, and a few stated that they liked the use of accordions on the page.

### 3. Overall, the ‘Disability compensation, pension, and GI Bill benefits’ section received mixed feedback.


>#### Some sections were described as clear and helpful, while others sections were described as too vague to be useful or actionable. Findability of the dispute form was tested in this study, and participants could find this section easily. However, this option did not always apply to their situation.

  
 

### 4. Helpfulness and actionability of '[Rogers STEM Scholarship,](https://zyc78g.csb.app/help-options#rogers-stem-scholarship) [VET TEC program](https://zyc78g.csb.app/help-options#vet-tec-program), [Separation pay,](https://zyc78g.csb.app/help-options#separation-pay) [Attorney fees](https://zyc78g.csb.app/help-options#attorney-fees)' section

>#### These section titles and the information under these sections: [Rogers STEM Scholarship,](https://zyc78g.csb.app/help-options#rogers-stem-scholarship) [VET TEC program](https://zyc78g.csb.app/help-options#vet-tec-program), [Separation pay,](https://zyc78g.csb.app/help-options#separation-pay) [Attorney fees](https://zyc78g.csb.app/help-options#attorney-fees) were too vague for participants to understand. They did not always make the connection between the section titles and the purpose of the page (find other ways to request help with other debts). The information underneath them was also too vague.


### 5. The Dispute Form was easy and straightforward and participants had suggestions of features or improvements that could be added.

### 6. Service Design Findings (mental models and past experiences resolving VBA overpayment debts - baseline): most participants described long, frustrating, experiences in attempting to resolve overpayments.


 ## Details of Findings

Provide detailed descriptions and supporting evidence for each key finding.

  

1.  ### Usability of the Debt Portal as a connected experience
    

### Key finding 1 (summary): Overall, navigation and findability of the debt portal were excellent, regardless of prior familiarity with the debt portal interface. Participants understood the design elements on each page, they navigated between pages easily, and they found information easily.

  

Participants were asked to rate the experience on a scale of 1 to 5 at various points in reviewing the prototype. Participants' ratings of the experience ranged between a 4 and a 5, indicating that they perceived it as “easy” with nothing or little to improve. This feedback was consistent, regardless of whether participants reviewed the prototype on mobile devices or laptop devices.

  

### Manage Your VA Debt page 


[https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt](https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt)

***Familiarity***

 
-   The first question participants were asked on this page was whether it looked familiar, to establish a baseline: 
    - P2, P4, P9, P1, P16, P15, and P17 were all familiar with the <Manage your VA debt> page (50% the participants)


- Participants commented on various aspects of the page that stood out to them:

   
	-   Not all of them knew about the help options and waiver
    
	-   Overall they like how the information/content is broken down
    
	-   “It looks organized and helpful” - P8
    
	-   “Seems thorough and self explanatory” -P8
    

  

-   Evaluations on this page focused on observing whether participants could find the Help Section on the page and what they understood to be the difference between the links:
    
*< Request help with VA overpayments and copay bills online>* 

and *<Learn about other ways to request help with VA debt*>

For the most part, participants could identify the difference between these two links without clicking into the links. This indicates that the section headers: If you want to request debt relief (a waiver or compromise offer) (associated link: [Request help with overpayments and copay bills online](https://zyc78g.csb.app/request-help)) and Other options to request help with VA debt (associated link: [Learn about other ways to request help with VA debt](https://zyc78g.csb.app/help-options)) were clear to participants.

### R&S page: Options to request help with VA debt

  

Participants were first given time to browse through the page and then asked follow up questions.

[https://zyc78g.csb.app/help-options](https://zyc78g.csb.app/help-options)

  

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd_xCPmkY7BWlWOAm3Kk1gfPOUyipn9RlCCG2Dc_Wnz_lbY0zpv5itcdLQ8br1La5sdk8RvDNLBtjO-NP-0qyt3KoaWCaxyAANvTn9udxuAipugBkgwPh8GeIgoDBNS5t160uibWg?key=XMnYNt8OBA-jeJa5-efunA)

  
  

2.  ### Finding #2: Usability of the Resources & Support page: navigation and content architecture were intuitive
    

#### Key finding (summary): Overall, participants found the Resources & Support page easy to navigate, and they liked that all of the information needed to seek resolution was on one page. The overall page hierarchy was intuitive to participants. All participants expanded the accordion with no issues, and a few stated that they liked the use of accordions on the page.

#### Finding (detail):

 
>“Everything is pretty much laid out for you…when you open up these plus signs it gives you the information there, and then also gives you a link or links to get further information for what you need. It's not like you have to go, you know, figure it out and find it in another section. It's just right there.” -P2

P1 repeatedly praised clarity of information:“Cut and dry, straight to the point.”

>“Self-explanatory.”

  

Two participants who utilized a screen reader (who interacted with the prototype) expanded the accordion with no issues as well.
  

> "... it breaks down everything that you can actually talk about. And then it's a hyperlink for anything that you need to talk about. It talks about yourself as a veteran. It talks about family members, it talks about schooling, and you know, and it gives you the hyperlink, so you can actually dive into it. So like I said, it's pretty much self-explanatory like I can't see how somebody can get confused on it, because it's walking you through the steps." -P13 (screen reader user)

3.  ### Finding # 3: Overall, the ‘Disability compensation, pension, and GI Bill benefits’ section received mixed feedback.
    
Some sections were described as clear and helpful, while others sections were described as too vague to be useful or actionable. Findability of the dispute form was tested in this study, and participants could find this section easily. However, this option did not always apply to their situation.

Veterans often wanted clarification on when and why to dispute a debt versus when to request financial help or appeal. There was some confusion about the difference between waivers, appeals, and disputes, and a need for clearer guidance—especially for debts under vs. over 5 years (e.g., when VA Form 5655 is needed).

In terms of prior mental models, most participants had their debts resolved before the interview. Some did not know about all of the options available, and some said the options available didn’t fit their situation.

### Titles that were unclear:

We recommend improving these accordion headers for clarity, as the way they are worded was confusing to a few participants:

**Request a repayment plan of less than 5 years
Request a repayment plan of 5 or more years or debt relief (a waiver or compromise offer)**

'More than 5 years' and 'less than 5 years' was confusing to a few participants:

-   Is it referring to an overpayment debt that happened more than 5 years ago/ less than 5 years ago OR is it referring to the repayment plan extended over more than 5 years / less than 5 years?
   
A few participants interpreted both in these interviews.

> "But this repayment plan of more than 5 years or debt relief does that mean? I need to repay over more than 5 years. Or does that mean I need to repay something from over 5 years ago?... It is said, like more than 2 years, I would think, okay, that's me because my debt was from more than 2 years ago. It would occur to me to say, 'oh, I need more than 5 years to pay this back'... I mean no debt that anybody has in any part of their life comes back to you and says, Hey, do you need more than 5 years to pay this. Well, I don't know. Let's compute how much the payments would be, and then I'll tell you." -P1

### Accordion titles that were clear:

  
**Dispute your overpayment**

Participants correctly identified this section/process as what would enable them to let the VA know that they shouldn’t have a debt (participants were asked: Can you show me where you might look if you want to see if there is a process to let the VA know that you shouldn’t have this debt?)

 
### Content nested within subsection that were *unclear*:

 
**Appeal the VA decision that resulted in this overpayment**

  
> “I wouldn’t say it is clear. You would have to click on it and hope it explains it or assume that’s what it means or call. That doesn’t say much at all. The second one gives a lot more information. Yeah I like the information it is giving it doesn’t leave you to assume. It looks like it tells you the exact process to go through in order to appeal. The second section is better, the less you have to call the VA to ask questions the better.” - P2


### Content nested within subsection that were *clear*:

  

**Dispute your overpayment**

  

> "I think it a good amount of information. Theres the start your dispute and you don’t need to go to another section. Years ago there was a section for information then a section for forms which was frustrating. I like this though." - P2

  

>”I like that each section has a link that correlates with that information. No questions here unless I need to know more about a topic." - P3

  

>"The information is great to the point its not daunting and I really appreciate the direct links for more information from those sources." P3

  

**‘Appeal the VA decision that resulted in this overpayment’ section**

  

Most participants had a general understanding of ‘Appeal the VA decision that resulted in this overpayment’.

  
  

### Finding # 4: Helpfulness and actionability of [Rogers STEM Scholarship,](https://zyc78g.csb.app/help-options#rogers-stem-scholarship) [VET TEC program](https://zyc78g.csb.app/help-options#vet-tec-program), [Separation pay,](https://zyc78g.csb.app/help-options#separation-pay) [Attorney fees](https://zyc78g.csb.app/help-options#attorney-fees)

  

These sections: [Rogers STEM Scholarship,](https://zyc78g.csb.app/help-options#rogers-stem-scholarship) [VET TEC program](https://zyc78g.csb.app/help-options#vet-tec-program), [Separation pay,](https://zyc78g.csb.app/help-options#separation-pay) [Attorney fees](https://zyc78g.csb.app/help-options#attorney-fees) were too vague for participants to understand, and they did not always make the connection between the section titles and the purpose of the page (find other ways to request help with other debts).

  

Several participants were confused by these sections. Not having experienced these types of debt before, a few participants assumed or questioned if these were actions they could take for their debt, such as hiring an attorney. Important context was missing from these sections to have a clear understanding of what they were referring to.  
  

Quotes:

>"Other options to request help page, thoughts on information: This is a lot. I am a bit overwhelmed already. Some of it doesn’t apply, I have no clue what Vet Tech is. Attorney fees make a phone call, could you tell me a bit more. "Is the title clear: It is clear but for attorney fees it says just make a phone call. Am I just supposed to know what Vet Tech is? STEM scholarship, I guess if you had one." - P15

  

> "I don't know what stem scholarships are, but I might be there as separation pay. That might be it, attorney, I don't know... and I don't think you can really fix this to make it better. But it's frustrating that you guys can't seem to find some English words." -P4

> “Attorney fees, I don't understand this. Attorneys are not cheap, are they saying the VA has attorneys on staff that don't charge you. I don't know what Vet Tech is…” -P8

> "VA doesn't pay attorney fees, wait, do they?" -P18


## Dispute Form Findings

### Finding #5: The Dispute Form was easy and straightforward

### Key finding (summary): Usability and comprehension were excellent, overall.

#### Finding (detail):

  

Participants were asked to answer comprehension questions related to the intro page of the Dispute Form on the accordion section (this information is the same as the first page of the form).

  
**Intro page:** 

  

Comprehension was excellent, indicating that the content/copy are clear: participants clearly understood that the time limit to dispute a debt is 1 year from receiving a debt letter, and needing to continue making payments to avoid collection actions.

  

**Overall experience with the form:**

Most participants found the digital dispute form “self-explanatory,” “cut and dry,” and “very easy” to understand and use. Steps were generally straightforward, and the process for submitting a dispute or finding help was clear. *

Quotes:

>“It is cut and dry, straight to the point. You can use it for any benefit overpayments but not copays.” - P1

> “If you are computer literate you can go through it, it’s all customized. I have friends that don’t know anything and this would be helpful.” - P4

> "I think it's a good amount of information. And I like how it has the "Start your dispute" right above there like you don't have to go into a totally different section in order to fill out forms..." -P2

> "I like it because it's very direct. So you know, sometimes, like, the website can be daunting and things like that. But, like, with this format, it's very direct. I knew pretty much what I would expect when I clicked on here, and it met those expectations." -P3

**Participants’ ideas to improve the form:**

  

-   Highlight information that is crucial to know in bold: “You’ll need to continue making payments on your debt while we review your dispute”.
    

 
>“I feel good because it says right there what to expect next. And so I would read that because that stood out to me right away. So that says just continue making payments.I would say again, like, maybe you know how like on the other page it said, ‘you have one year to 30 days’, and the one year was highlighted or bold, and the 30 days was bold. I would say, ‘you'll need to continue making payments’ would be bold, and then ‘we'll mail you a letter’ would be bold.” -P17

“I feel like, if you put it in before 30 days you're probably still gonna get money taken out because they're not gonna get it, probably not gonna get it done before 30 days… Usually takes months to years from the VA, so it seems like they would still take money out.” -P2

  

-   A few participants expressed concerns and highlighted the importance of the statement on the Reason for you Dispute page.
    

>”It's easy, and the thing is, you know, you may not think a lot about it, but what you type there is incredibly important. And it's easy to just breeze through it and not really include all the details, and that could affect your claim. It's a bit too easy, I think, because, you know. once you press submit, that's it. You can't edit it.” -P15

  

>”Just like if I broke the time down that it would be, like, I would ask how they got this amount. Is it the time that I was in school, or was it the full amount?... Yeah. So I probably would still call in to see how it's broken down to see if that's the accurate amount.” -P1

  

-   Some participants mentioned they would like to see an example statement to know what information to provide in the open text field on the form.
    

  

> “I knew how many steps were in the process. So it added that transparency. I will say that I do wish that there was an example given, for, like what type of information to include in the dispute statement, because I think that that would just be nice. And then you could get an idea of like, okay, like this is what to expect, and you know how that looks, and just making sure that I'm doing my due diligence on my end.” -P3

  

-   Some participants mentioned they would like an option to edit the information on the Review Page.
    

  

-   Some participants mentioned they would like a way to upload important documents.
    

## Service Design Findings (mental models and past experiences resolving VBA overpayment debts - baseline)

  

### Finding #6:

### Key finding (summary):

### The majority of participants (10 of 14 interviewed) described long, frustrating, experiences in attempting to resolve overpayments. Given their difficult experiences resolving overpayments, they were also keenly aware of the importance of essential information being clearly communicated and conveyed in the prototype.


Detail:
Veterans’ baseline experience with VA debt relief and disputes has often been negative, marked by confusion and a lack of clear channels. The introduction of digital pathways (the debt portal) represents a significant improvement, making the process clearer, more accessible, and less stressful. Veterans appreciate structured options, transparent next steps, and confirmation of actions—though some still need personal support for complex situations.


Participants 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 10, 15, 16, 17, and 18 (10 of 14) describe long, confusing, or frustrating processes—ranging from repeated phone calls, not knowing who to contact, waiting months, feeling ignored or “put in a bind,” to using words like “frustrating,” “harassment,” and “manipulation” to describe their experiences. 

 
> “It was horrible because I was looking for it to pay bills and it put me in a bind. The second time was very easy.” P1

  

> “I just let it be because I didn’t think there was anything else I could do; they were taking it monthly and I thought that would still happen. It would’ve been nice to have that option.” P2

  

> “Frustrating, confusing, or not knowing what the best course of action is. They claim that they overpaid me for Veteran benefits. From that there was a miscalculation of what I could get sent. P3

  

> Moderator: In one to 3 words, if you were to summarize this whole experience recently and up until now, what words would you use to describe the process of understanding and resolving this debt in your experience, so far? Participant: “Harassment. Manipulation. And even discrimination, I was discriminated against because I'm a woman.” -P10

  
> “I think it's askva.gov and submitted a question, and they said it was accurate. And then within about a week the money got taken back out. So I said, Well, hmm, obviously it was not accurate, and askva.gov is not reliable, so I'm not going to go there… So I called and after waiting half a day on hold. I know they're busy, but shoot, that's just incredible. … Now, this is the 3rd exchange of money, and it should hit my bank, but I actually got the money deposited before I actually received the letter. And then when I got the letter, and it said, here's what we owe you. I thought, Okay, this is crazy. Something's wrong here. And I just that's where I am right now. I don't want to deal with it anymore. I have better things to do than to stress out over this…”  
“I'm too old to deal with all this. And then this came out of the blue last year, and it started up again. And I went back into that mind space. And I said, okay, let me see if I can resolve it. And I could not, because of the 3 different answers.” -P18

Moderator: “What would feel like a good closure for you at this point?”

> **“Explaining to me about my overpayment. Number 2: Speak to me about my options. Number 3:Listen to me actively, and understand that there's no real overpayment debt.** This is something falsified under my name that I don't even have, and I don't even know how it even got you there. And then they come with another letter about some educational program that I was in, that I never was in, and a lot of other things that we're just adding to it. About housing which I never received, and a lot of lies. I was having to have documentation to prove all lies, and there's no facts here, and they're just trying to throw in something like you do with other folks to make a case, or a debt or etc.” -P10

 

**Several participants noted that they had issues when calling VA.**

 
> “There is a phone number, 800-827-1000,and it's the universal switchboard, if you call it, it knows which way to send you inside the VA…And now I want to go back to this number that ends in 2411 [and] 0648 I have called all those numbers many times and mostly they say, Yeah, we can see you're arguing about your account but there's nothing we can do about it. We're not the right department. And that's my biggest frustration. I don't know what the right department is, but it really bugs me that nobody will tell me what the right department is.” -P4

> “They send a correspondence. They correspond pretty fast. Email or snail mail. It's just the phone system is terrible… We just need to scrap the whole customer service thing, because, like I said, you just get in the queue and you'll stay on there for 30, 40 min you'll wait your time, and then it hangs up on you. So yeah, it's frustrating.” -P16

  

## Additional Insights

Include insights that do not represent patterns but are still valuable.

TIP: These could be powerful user comments or unexpected issues worth noting

  

-   A few participants were experiencing stressful emotions (unrelated to the interview) after recently resolving or attempting to resolve their debts. This allowed for a more individualized approach to that Veteran during the interview in which the moderator leveraged trauma-informed skills (acknowledging the difficulty, checking in with the participant, gentle redirection to a less painful topic, and ending the interview on a positive note). ​
  

-   Several participants had comments about the perception and reality of time and deadlines, and how these don’t always line up with their everyday reality. Furthermore, they also highlighted the importance of emphasizing these important timelines and deadlines in the prototype.
    

  

Quotes:

  
  

> “The fact that you can only ask for help within 1 year, that I don’t think I like because peoples financial situations change. If they lose their job and then need help it isn’t an option for a waiver. A lot can change in a year.” P2

  

>”I would say again.like, maybe you know how like on the other page it said, ‘you have one one year to 30 days’, and the one year was highlighted or bold, and the 30 days was bold. I would say, ‘you'll need to continue making payments’ would be bold, and then ‘we'll mail you a letter’ would be bold.” -P17


##   Accessibility Findings, N = 2


P11 - 2 years experience with VoiceOver and mouse, MacBook, sighted

P13 - An experienced VoiceOver (iOS) user who is totally blind on iPhone


### Positive insights - what worked well for both AT participants: 

#### Comprehension

-   Both participants described the pages as self-explanatory and easy to understand.
    
-   Information such as how to dispute a debt, request help, or contact support was clear
    
-   Links were easy to identify and navigate using VoiceOver
    
-   Key elements like accordions and form fields worked and were announced correctly with VoiceOver.
    
-   Both participants had clear understanding that the “+, plus sign” expanded the accordion with related information.
    

  

#### Usability

-   Both participants found the Dispute Your Debt form easy to follow and complete.
    
-   Progress indicators like “Step 2 of 4” were helpful for orientation.
    
-   Fields had appropriate labels and logical flow.
    

  

#### Consistency and Standards

-   Participants noted that the layout was consistent with other VA.gov pages, making it familiar and predictable.
    
-   Content followed a logical progression, which made it easy to navigate
    
-   Users prefer long, scrollable pages over multiple clicks/hyperlinks, especially with screen reader interaction.
    

### Finding 1:  One beginner VO participant had a preference for fewer external windows

  

*Supporting data:*  
    

-   P11 expressed a general preference for fewer external windows when clicking on links, to avoid disconnected interactions:
    

  

-   P11 did not directly call this out, but described the experience of trying to interact with various links as “choppy,” and expressed a general preference for fewer external windows when clicking on links, to avoid disconnected interactions
    

  

### Finding 2:  One beginner VO participant had difficulty managing the verbosity of his screenreader when reviewing the prototype

  

P11 -

*Supporting data*
    

-   “It would be nice to select what you want instead of it reading all of it. It seems to be reading more than typical.”
    

  

*Supporting data*
    

-   VoiceOver may be reading entire sections or full paragraphs by default rather than just the item in focus.
    
-   The team’s accessibility expert identified the issue and helped the participant troubleshoot this issue during the session.
    

### Finding 3:  Disconnected or Redundant Information

Too many steps/pages to get to the actual form; information is fragmented, which can be frustrating for assistive tech users.

  

-   Supporting data: “Why not have the form right here under the paragraph… The same type of information should be on the same page.” - P11
    
*Supporting data* 
    

-   Both participants encountered some issues where information felt repetitive, disconnected, or unnecessarily spread out, especially in the Dispute Your Debt form experience.
    
-   P11 noted redundancy when selecting a dispute reason and then being asked to type the same explanation again on the text field.
    
-   P11 suggested putting the dispute form directly under the explanation paragraph to avoid making users jump to a new section or page.
    

**Recommendation:**

-   Minimize the number of navigation steps to reach actionable content.
    
-   Group related and connected information on one page where possible
    

## Recommendations

Summarize actionable recommendations based on findings.

  

1.  Recommendation, R&S page:
    

- Adding more context under the section titles for clarity
    
-   Add the word "debt" next to appropriate section titles for additional clarity, ***example: Rogers STEM Scholarship Debt***
    

  

2.  Recommendation, R&S page: 

- Add additional context to more than 5 years ago/ less than 5 years ago sections
    
-   Supporting evidence: Finding 4
    

  

3.  Recommendation: Dispute form 

- “Tell us why you're disputing this debt” page should have additional context and examples to help Veterans understand what information should be shared.
    

  

4.  Recommendation: Dispute form: 

- Implement a way to upload documents
    

  

5.  Recommendation: Dispute form

- Add edit buttons that take users back into the form on the Review page.
    
-   Edit buttons were not available on the prototype but will be available on production when the dispute form launches.
    

  

## Product User and Business Outcomes

Explain how findings and recommendations align with the product's goals.

Refer back to your Product Outline.

  

### [Digital Dispute](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/Debt%20Resolution/digital-dispute/product-outline.md)

  

**User Outcomes**

  

-   Ability to dispute either the existence or amount of a VA Debt
    
-   Easy access to user-friendly process with clear instructions and minimal and simple input required from user.
    
-   Clear understanding of timelines and next steps in the dispute process
    
-   Ability to submit a written statement to present their individual situation and reasoning for disputing the debt.
    
-   Receives an email confirmation of their debt dispute submission.
    

  

	-   This research supports our desired user outcomes by confirming that the Digital Dispute form that we designed is user friendly, with clear instructions, and simple, based on participants interviewed in this study.
    
	-   The statement page was user friendly and only copy refinements are needed to help provide guidance on what kind of information Veterans should include.
    
	-   The timeline and next steps in the dispute process were clear to participants.
    

  

**Business Outcomes**

  

-   Simplify and streamlined process for receiving debt disputes from Veterans.
    
-   Achieve faster resolution and reducing processing times
    
-   Decreased disputes being processed through debt management center and HRC.
    
-   Improved customer satisfaction and Veteran experience
    
-   Standardization of debt dispute process
    

  

	-   This research supports our desired business outcomes by confirming the path created for a digital dispute process can help achieve faster resolution and reduced processing times for the user-facing portion of the process because our research found the process is simple and streamlined for Veterans.
    

  
  

### [Resources & Support (R&S) Page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/combined_fsr/wizard/Wizard%20sub-task%20pattern%20product%20outline.md)

  

**User Outcomes**

  

-   The "Wizard sub-task pattern" release is focused on The Wizard experience at the beginning of the FSR. This experience needs to be updated for a few reasons:
    

-   Better inclusion of copay paths.
    
-   Rework of overall design format/experience "one question per page"
    
-   Addition of a payment path
    
-   Connection with streamlined waiver
    

  
  

	-   This research supports our desired user outcome by confirming that the new Wizard design pattern, which after several iterations is now a single page Resources & Support (R&S) page, is user friendly.
    
	-   Copy improvements will have to be made with the Content Team to improve the information on the page so it is more clear in some sections outlined in the Findings of this report.
    
	-   This research tested VBA overpayment situations only and we recommend getting feedback from Veterans that have copays to assess whether the copay content is sufficient and clear.
    

## Key Performance Indicators

Explain how findings will support KPI measurement.

Note

Refer back to your Product Outline.

  

Digital Dispute

  

-   KPI: Total number of digital debt disputes, Total number of submission confirmations sent
    

-   This research supports measurement of this KPI - we are setting up an analytics dashboard to measure this.
    

-   KPI: Error Rate: Total number of errors/failures
    

-   The BE team will track this.
    

-   KPI: Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)
    

-   We will look for Veteran feedback on this process in the monthly Medallia reports.
    

## Next Steps

Outline immediate actions based on findings, including owners if applicable.

-   The UX team will work with the Content Team and make recommendations to improve the copy on the R&S page based on the findings of this study.
    



## Further research needed

Identify gaps in the current study and areas requiring additional investigation––such as demographics that were not included in this study.

  

-   Review of external pages
    
-   Veterans with copay debt
    

  
  

## Limitations

  

-   The prototype was highly responsive, but not personalized to the participants’ unique situations
    
-   One AT participant had unexpected interactions from the mouse that interfered with the user’s screen reader navigation. Scrolling appeared to cause unexpected jumps in focus or screen reader context which disrupted the mental map and caused loss of orientation on the page.
    
-   Veterans reviewed content and information mostly only on R&S page accordion without visiting external content pages that contained more detail.
    
-   Most participants had not disputed an overpayment before.
    
-   Participants who utilized screen readers had not had an overpayment before.
