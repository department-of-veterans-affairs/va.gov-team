### Verbatim notes taken by Perigean

# **Conversation Guide for Financial Management Team, R/S Page & Digital Dispute , May 2025**

## **Getting to know you (10 minutes)**

Hello/Welcome

Thank you so much for your time today. My name is Charlotte and I work at VA.gov - it’s nice to meet you!

How are you today?

I work at VA.gov to help improve access to benefits and services for Veterans like you. This work is meaningful to me because I believe that those who have served have a right to these services. [meaning]

You’ll notice there are a few people on the call already. They’re my colleagues and they’re here to listen and to learn. Is that ok with you? [permission]

My goal today is to learn how easy or difficult it is to use a digital portal we are working on to help you understand how to resolve and resolve VA overpayment debts.

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

Next, I want to explain my role better.

I am a consultant for the VA and my role is to talk to Veterans like you to understand the challenges you face in the space of VA medical copay billing. I am gathering information to help improve the experience of managing or resolving your VA copay bills.

The limits of my role are that I am not the final decision maker on the experience nor am I a financial expert, but I can surface issues and challenges that come up in research to the VA.

Your comfort and well-being are very important to us.

Sensitive topics might come up, and if at any point you want to take a break, please let me know. If you want or need to stop the interview at any point, just let me know. [comfort and consent]

Your identity will be kept confidential, and any information we take away from the interview will be stored securely. [confidentiality]

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more. Yes.

_Optional_:

One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like you’re on-screen image.

[Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA.]

At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.

Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences? Exactly the same answer, yes you can use it in anyway useful to the VA and VA customers.

Do you have any questions for me? Not really, I don’t know what we are going to study.

I want to make sure the next 60 minutes are still good for you today? Absolutely I blocked off serval hours.  
  

### **START INTERVIEW**

## **Warm-up**  
[Rapport building]

● We like to start off with a lighthearted question to get to know you better.

● What’s something you enjoy doing these days—any hobbies or routines? OR What's your favorite thing about Spring? I am very happy and feel lucky because I am alive. I have a long life story, plane crash, liver transplant, heart issues. I am healthy, financial security and have a good family. I am alive and it's your fault. I am religious but the pills the doctors give me, advice and shots, make for a pleasant life and I am 80. I have done it all and ready to coast to the end.

● Thank you for sharing! (personal response)

### **Baseline [5 minutes]**

● Can you briefly tell me what your most recent experience with VA overpayment debt has been and when it appeared? [establish baseline] About 2 years ago new rules/laws put claims in under the pact act, 9 months ago they said I was 100 percent disabled. That makes a lot change. I stopped getting money from DoD and started getting more from the VA. I was short changed 150 dollars, I want it, I am entitled to it and I want it so I am talking to DoD and they are convinced I am wrong. Not possible, I am never wrong. They audited my account for 20 years and I think they were trying to get back at me. Did an audit from 2004 to 2024. They came up with the information I was owed 12K. I owe them 3K so I would only get 9K or the 12K. It is a complicated issue; they owe the DoD 3K and they owe me 9K. The VA said they look into it and split it into different questions and everyone is blaming it on someone else and then they want to collect the 3K from me then figure out the other 2. Then 10 days ago after 9 months ago of a nightmare. The VA called me and stated  “ assume everyone before me is an idiot and I will fix it” long story short I was right I am entitled to the 9K and the VA will pay the air force and my checks in the mail. We had a conversation and he said it should take two days but give it two weeks. Sure enough I was tired of waiting and everyone agreed with him and the next day the check showed up in my bank and my va files shows its closed out. I never got the 150 but I got the 9K and now its all fixed. There are stupid people and they do stupid things. I seems to find the right one. It got fixed and I am happy, the new story love to print when the va screws up but I am a lucky story. I hope whatever you do will make it easier for the next person because humans make mistakes and it shouldn’t be a nightmare to get it fixed.

● Online portal: I used it a whole lot. Safari and chrome. I use chrome for va and patient portal. Then safari for everything else but not va because they don’t support it. If you can make it support it I would appreciate it. I used it a lot in the past 9 months. The links and departments are a nightmare. I want to point out there’s a department for claims collection, if you owe a debt to the va, whoever is in charge of it they send it to collections and they say they will take x amount for x years then provide a number to call. They say they cant do anything and don’t call us. They can collect the debt but we cant do anything other than that. It is insulting and that’s where I started 9 months ago. I asked who to call and they said the regional office. They don’t know which one is in charge of me. You would think it was the Chicago office but no one could tell me who it was. The office ended up being in Minneapolis. Glad the web is there but its not up to date or useful.

● What, if any, actions have you taken to understand or resolve this debt?

● In 1-3 words, what words would you use to describe the process of understanding and resolving your debt in your experience so far?

## **Warm-up Questions - (3-5 minutes)**

Before we look at the design prototype, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

● What device are you using today? Computer, MacPro with external monitor

### **Prototype (5 minutes)**

Let’s go to the next part of the interview where we are going to share a digital experience we’re working on and ask for your feedback. A few things I want you to know:

You'll be interacting with a prototype that may not work exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. This is very important to know: since it's a demo, we have used fake information, and none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. In this task, we would like to hear your honest feedback. Please comment on what is clear and unclear.

I am going to drop a link in the Zoom chat. When you receive the link, please open the page. Send direct link to Debt Portal prototype Link: ([https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt](https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt)) [Mobile sessions screen share directions] [Sharing screen instructions as needed]

### **Manage your VA debt for benefit overpayments and copay bills [**[**page**](https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt)**] [2-3 minutes]**

● Does this page look familiar to you? Very familiar, I am not sure it was worded the same. I have been coming here for 9 months and getting frustrated. Oaky you wouldn’t expect a choice here but I want a choice you are wrong I want to talk to someone here. Review debts online, I sign in and nothing on here says I do not agree. Its just presumed that I would give in and pay the money. You are asking me to pay a 5$ ticket but you’re asking me to pay 12K no. There should be something up front that says I disagree and I am not paying but its not right here it was on another page. If you disagree, send a letter. Where do you send the letter? That’s a real question. It should be good to have which department or an address to send the letter to. Theres no address to send it to. So I made 5 copies of the letter and sent it to 5 departments and each one said they got the letter and filed it and didn’t know what to do with it so they didn’t sent to anyone and its not their responsibility. This is organized but as I got into it, it is a rabbit hole that goes around and around.

● Given your current or recent situation, what are you most interested in on this page? [Mental Models] If you want to request debt relief, (reading page) None of this address that you don’t agree with it. This is not useful to me. Other options.

● Take a moment to show me where on the page you would go to get help with your debt [task]

● I’d like to bring you attention to the ‘Request Financial Help section. [comprehension]

● What are your thoughts about this page? Any information missing that you’d like to see?

● Where on this page would you click on if you wanted help with your debt? Can you point out which links, specifically?

● Before you click, what do you understand to be the difference between the first link <[Request help with overpayments and copay bills online](https://zyc78g.csb.app/request-help)> and the second <[Learn about other ways to request help with VA debt](https://zyc78g.csb.app/help-options)> [Mental Models]

● Which link would you most interested in clicking on first? Why?

● Please click on the link

● Learn about other ways: I don’t think you can fix this but my complaint is with this here. The Airforce said the VA owes me money. I don’t know which category it would be for . It turns out is it the compensation. I have disability, GI Bill, and Pension. I don’t know and I don’t think you can fix it to make that better, its frustrating you can't find English words too. Dispute with overpayment, oh yeah I found this page because I remember the 1 year and 30 days.

## **Introductory pages and R&S page (orientation and wayfinding)**

● Please take some time to browse through this page. Please remember to think aloud

● What stands out to you? Theres a number to the VA help line. It is the universal switchboard and it knows which way to send you in the VA, very helpful and professional individuals. They can help some but mostly send you to the right people. That number should be here and explained. Back to the 2411 and 1238 numbers, I have called them many times and mostly they say yes we see you are arguing about the account but we aren’t the right people. It bothers me no one would tell me the right department.

● What questions do you have after reviewing this page, if any?

● Which option would you say is relevant to your situation?

● Can you show me where you might look if you want to see if there is a process to let the VA know that you shouldn’t have this debt? [task: finding dispute section]

● If unclear, give a bit more guidance [partial pass]

● Based on what it says here, what is important to know about disputing overpayment debt?

● What could happen after 30 days if you don't make any payments on your debt? [correct answer: could be sent to collections]

● Do you have any questions or concerns after reading this paragraph?

## **Dispute Form**

Before we move on to this next section, I have some questions about the pages you just reviewed.

● What would you change if anything? What can be improved? Was anything unclear?

● We want to know your thoughts on how easy or difficult the experience you reviewed is. When you answer this question, think about how easily you would find information you are most interested in

● Why did you rate it a (rating)?

## **Digital Dispute Intro page**

● What are your thoughts on this page?

● Is anything unclear?

● Do you have any concerns after reading this paragraph?

### **Prompt**

● Please go ahead and go through this form, imagining you were filling this form out. I want to remind you that the information filled out in this demo is fake information.

● Please remember to talk aloud and point out anything that is unclear or confusing

● I’ll stop you if I have follow up questions  
[Reason for dispute page]

Oh there’s two different disputes here. Theres two departments that want money from me. Okay new complaint, I put in a request to the VA. Lets say my condition changed and I want it changed to 20 percent because my arm fell off and I want to go back to school. So two different requests and the only things in common is my name. They don’t assign different control numbers, so they will say the request has been processed, under consideration, or approved. A week later when you get the 20-page letter you don’t know what was approve or not. This screen makes it clear that one is for Gi bill and on is compensation, if that is correct I am happy to see that screen.

● Do any of these reasons apply to you? Which one would you select and why? I don’t think I owe this debt; the second bullet isn’t a complete sentence. If this happened in real life I would go through the roof but this is a demo. I would put dear people you are stupid and I don’t owe it for the following reasons. It would be like 2000 words. I have a PDF and a word doc I can cut and paste in there. Okay that’s the end of that.

This square need to be bigger and allow attachments and references and hyperlinks would be great also.

Why hyperlinks: Theres a webpage that says my page is processing and is in phase 2. Then they will tell me if they need new information. I would want to put the link in there so they see that it is frustrating and I have been dealing with it for 3 months and you wont write back to me.

● What type of information would you include in this section? All of  this is correct (Review page) I would go back to the VA information, I don’t know enough and they assigned my va number as my SSN. I am on of the first people to have 1 number except the screens like this sometimes they will sue the last 4 or full 9. I am 80 so there must be a lot of people with only 1 number. I would like to see them update this. This screen is an example of slamhammer that no one can misunderstand it. I love that. I’d like to have it canceled. If this is what I say, I deserve more of an answer of oh we will look at it.

● Feel that’s the answer you got: absolutely not, the answer I got from everyone, maybe 50 people in 25 different departments. They were professional but said they aren’t able to help me and they didn’t know who was responsible for it. Thats why I wrote my congressman. The guy say they are idiots and they will fix it today.

● Do you know what department that was in: no I wish I did. I was in the car and he called and talked to me for 10-15 minutes and I didn’t write down his name or department so I cant call to say thank you. It seems to me one thing the va needs to do is put names on things. I get letters signed department head. Do you know who it is. You can’t find out who wrote the letter and when you call they cant find it out either. I would sign and certify it. The form is submitted (reading page) It says 5 days; the human race has an issue with time. If I don’t hear form someone in 10 days I call because I assume its broken. There needs to be pressure on the managers to get messages out in a reasonable time. The message I get will say they received my request and they are looking into it. What is it that they received, it should say we received your application of correct of debt. It shouldn’t be general. If you get a letter saying you owe 300 dollars, like who are you and for what. The va cant say that some department, I could owe it in parking. Its generic letters, they are confusing and insulting. All I know is whoever answers the phone better know what I am talking about and can’t tell me anything. Or forwarded it to and they don’t know who they forwarded it to. If I send a letter to the va and it needs to go to the regional office is goes through MI then figures out which office is responsible for me and they forward it. If it doesn’t get sent to the right one, the one responsible or the one that isn’t it sits in limbo until I call and yell and they track it down and get it to the right place. They don’t have a self-correction program.

● [ Review and submit page]

● Do they expand the accordion?

● Any concerns on this page?

### **DIGITAL DISPUTE MENTAL MODELS**

● Now that you've gone through this form, I'd like to take some time to reflect and hear about how your experience was today. Please only comment on your experience with the form.

● How did you feel while completing this form? Were there any moments where you felt frustrated or overwhelmed? If so, why?

● Do you feel confident about what actions you need to take next?

● Did you know this option to resolve your debt existed?

● Have you encountered something similar to this process before?

● How does this compare?

● What did you expect to see on this form that wasn’t there if anything? Was anything missing?

● When you answer this next question, think about how easily you would be able to fill out this form

● On a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being not easy at all, and 5 being very easy, how easy to understand fill out was this form?

● Why did you rate it a (rating)?

## **Whole Experience Post Task Questions (5 minutes)**

● Now thinking about the experience from start to finish, how was your experience? Was anything difficult? Was anything easy?

● What would you change if anything? What can be improved? Was anything unclear?

● Services your feel good about: they are 98 percent good but don’t think I wont talk about the 2 percent I will talk about it a whole lot. If I get prescriptions from the VA there’s a number it says hi and don’t commit suicide then takes me to the main switch board. If I need a prescription press 1 then it says hi don’t commit suicide, over again if you are active duty press 1 and retiree press 2, there’s not reason for this. There’s another number that goes right to where you need. They said we cant figure it out and we can’t change it because they are worried it will mess something else. They have given me good advice, don’t commit suicide and sent meds when I finally get there. The 3 recordings that say don’t commit suicide, by the 3rd  or 4th  time I think maybe I should. The medical patient portal and va website, I cant count the number of good and non-frustrating things there. The things that piss me off, fi you want to close down I click log off, you know they took all those off. Its not under your name in the drop-down menu, you can argue both ways but it should be on every page because 99 percent of the world shouldn’t have to look for the log off button.

● How are you feeling: I am fine I am a va success story. This is what happens when the va does something right. The mental health people, glass, ear, all of them, in my case everything worked out and I am the luckiest guy on earth. I am telling you the 2 percent and a lot of people get shafted because of it. I hope some of the things I said will allow your team to make it better. Were working from 98 so maybe to 99. I am not in crisis I am not in trouble. The moment I hang up I am going to laugh. Think about falling into an outhouse but it was clean and filled with roses. I am the luckiest people in the world and if this has given back to your people and makes it better I am happy. If it doesn’t I am not offended. I am going to go take my medicine and go back to bed. I have pneumonia.

Those are all the questions that I had for you today.

## **Permission to use clips with internal VA partners**

● Circling back about the optional use of clips with internal VA partners. Now that you know what we’ve discussed, are you still comfortable with this? Yes you may use this for anythign in the va that may be useful

● Do you have any questions for me or is there anything else that you think that I should know?

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it works well for all Veterans.

**[End of session]**

## **Emergency Exit**

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so it’s easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
