### Verbatim notes taken by Perigean


# AT Conversation Guide for Financial Management Team, R/S Page & Digital Dispute, May 2025

## **Getting to know you (10 minutes)**

Welcome!

Thank you so much for your time today. My name is Charlotte and I work at VA.gov - it’s nice to meet you!

How are you today?

I work at VA.gov to help improve access to benefits and services for Veterans like you. This work is meaningful to me because I believe that those who have served have a right to these services. [meaning]

You’ll notice there are a few people on the call already. They’re my colleagues and they’re here to listen and to learn. Is that ok with you? [permission]

My goal today is to understand how usable and accessible an experience we’re working on is.

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

Next, I want to explain my role better.

I am a consultant for the VA and my role is to talk to Veterans like you to understand the challenges you face in the space of VA medical copay billing. I am gathering information to help improve the experience of managing or resolving your VA copay bills.

The limits of my role are that I am not the final decision maker on the experience nor am I a financial expert, but I can surface issues and challenges that come up in research to the VA.

Your comfort and well-being are very important to us.

Sensitive topics might come up, and if at any point you want to take a break, please let me know. If you want or need to stop the interview at any point, just let me know. [comfort and consent]

Your identity will be kept confidential, and any information we take away from the interview will be stored securely. [confidentiality]

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more. Yes ma’am

**Optional**:

One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like you’re on-screen image.

[Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA.]

At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.

Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences? I am fine with it.

Do you have any questions for me? No ma’am

Just want to ensure the next 75 minutes are still good for you today? That’s fine.

**START INTERVIEW**

3-5 minutes

[Rapport building]

  
  

· We like to start off with a lighthearted question to get to know you better.

· What's your favorite thing about Spring? I like to kayak rock climb, turkey/deer hunt. I am an all-around country guy. I kayak 75 percent of the rivers, the Grand Canyon in 2018. 226 miles in 8 days. Since 2017 I have been kayaking. Open ocean and ocean kayaks are okay but I prefer a river boat.

· Thank you for sharing! (personal response)

## **[Intro to study] (5 minutes)**

Now we’ll start the more formal interview.

Today I will be sharing a survey on VA.gov to help orient you to the right place depending on your unique situation with VA copays or VA debt.

## **Warm-up Questions - (3-5 minutes)**

Before we look at the design prototype, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

· What device are you using today? iPhone

· Does the device you're using have a screen to share? Yes ma’am

· What type of screenreader or other assistive technology are you using? (Voiceover? Something else?) I am using VoiceOver.

· How comfortable are you using your screenreader, how long have you been using it? I am pretty comfortable I have been doing it since 2006.

### Prototype (5 minutes)

Let’s go to the next part of the interview where we are going to share a digital experience we’re working on and ask for your feedback. A few things I want you to know:

You'll be interacting with a prototype that may not work exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. This is very important to know: since it's a demo, we have used fake information, and none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. In this task, we would like to hear your honest feedback. Please comment on what is clear and unclear.

I am going to drop a link in the Zoom chat. When you receive the link, please open the page. Send direct link to Debt Portal prototype Link: ([https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt](https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt)) [Mobile sessions screen share directions] [Sharing screen instructions as needed]

## **Conversation guide questions for intro pages paths**

**Manage Your VA Debt Page  
  
**

· What stands out to you on this page? You know what it is pretty much self-explanatory. It gives you information if you need a waiver, how to dispute. It gives hours of operation and hours. If you need to talk to someone you have the numbers.

· Content: I think it is very informative because it lets the individual know they can do a waiver, if you want to dispute you can, if you need help you can call. It is phenomenal, it gives a lot of information. I am the former director of blind veterans association so trying to get them on a website and going to the link. This is good because it gives good information.

· [Task]

· Imagine you wanted to find links on this page to get help with VA overpayments and VA debts. Can you please explore the page and point out which links are to get help?

· How many links are there?

· [Task, if only found one link]

· If you have issues you can call, there’s a link to get help filling out the form. You can get a VA representative. Do you want me to click the link to dispute the charges. Theres a number to call debt management and links. It gives the times and if you have questions about medical copayment bills there’s a link for that number. And they have a link for the TTY number. Theres VA debt management link you can click on. Then you can dispute it using the link and you can do it on that link. You can file a dispute and there’s a link for that. Then there’s a number if you have issues filing out the form. Then there’s the tty has a link. Ig you have problems filling out the form you can get help, then the number has a link. Theres another number for overseas. Then if you have questions about the copay there’s a number and a link. That’s it. Like I said it is very self-explanatory and has a link for everything. If you have questions there a link for you and you don’t need to dial the number there’s the number that’s links.

· Any other links about the section you were at: Oh it gives you a link to va.gov if you have a debt you can pay it right on va.gov. Then it gives you the link for va.gov website as well. It shows you how to pay by phone or mail. You can request financial help. Oh if you have questions about an overpayment/copayment there’s a link for that as well. Here is other ways to request help with a hyperlink. Okay you have 1 year.

· Thoughts on that link and the other link above: With that when you have other ways to request it with hat link it will take you to another browser to help you. I mean you can pay it online or if you have other questions it takes you to a link. I think it will give the descriptions and it provides the number if you have any questions you can dispute or request the waiver. You only have 1 year from the year you are notified. It is great how it is laid out; it is self-explanatory.

· Can you please find the link on the page to find out other ways to request help with VA debt?

· Please click on the link

**Options to request help with VA debt (R&S page)**

· Please take some time to explore this page and let me know if you have any concerns

· What stand out: Wow. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. It lets you know if you have a stem scholarships you can email and there’s a hyperlink there. Your finances have decreased there’s a link for that.

· What is clear? No ma’am it breaks down everything you can talk about and there’s a hyper link to talk about it. There for veterans and family members with schooling and there’s a hyper link that you can dive into it. I don’t know how people could get confused because it is walking you through the steps.

· What is unclear?

· What are your thoughts on the amount of content on this page? Is it too much or just enough? It is very self-explanatory. I don’t think you could be confused, it breaks down everything an individual would want. If you had any hardships there’s a link for that, you can put in a grant or waiver but I don’t see how people could get confused. Like I said it is very self-explanatory.

· Imagine you wanted to dispute an overpayment. Please show me where you might go to find information to help you dispute this overpayment: there’s a hyperlink on there. How to dispute the copay charges and I am on that link.

· What does it say when you go over dispute your overpayment: Okay it is collapsed let me click on it. You can dispute the payment online.

· Easy/difficult 1-5 rating: I would say a 5, it lets you know it is collapsed so you click on it and it bring it up. Theres a lot of information hat needs to be known. And it lets you know where you are and that it is collapsed and then it opens up. It isn’t hard for me, I cant speak for other veterans but to me advancement it was easy and very informative if you are paying attention. I am totally blind so I don’t see how a sighted person cant do it.

· [Can they expand the menu?]

· How do you feel about the amount of information you had to review before finding this information to dispute your debt?

If gives you the actual  form and if you cant finish it saves it and you can come back later. To me I think it is fantastic because you have people that might need to look for documents. You can save what you have then come back. That is phenomenal.

**Dispute Your Debt Form**

· Please take some time to go through this form, imagining you had to fill it out. I will quietly observe.

· Please pause at any areas on the pages where you have any concerns or feedback.

Okay. Okay. It is about overpayments not for copays. It lets you know so you can’t say you didn’t know and if you need to dispute the copay bill it has the link for that so you aren’t confused about what you are filling out. It gives you the year mark. You have 1 year since you got it to appeal the debt. 1 year to dispute it and if you dispute within 30 days you can avoid collection action. Wow I wasn’t expecting that. You still have to pay until the dispute is processed. Then it gives you the number and the hyper link then TTY number. I don’t think people need a representative but if you need help it gives you the link and fi you have any questions there’s a hyperlink, an overseas number, and hours of operations.

How to start the form: Start your dispute and click on it. It is a hyperlink so it will take you right in.

Okay I am hector. That’s need because if you need to update the information it gives the hyperlink for that. Okay. It gives you multiple ways to contact you, number, email, mailing address. You can always go on there and edit the information if your information isn’t right. It gives the edit options and the continue.

Does it tell you how many steps you are in: Okay. I am on step 2 of 4.

So it gives you all of the debt you already got so. So which one do you want me t click, it gives me all of the debt on file. Just click one. I will check that one and continue. Okay, I would say I don’t think I owe it and continue.

Thoughts so far on the form: So far I don’t think it is hard. It is basically self-explanatory.

You know what, I am at step 3 of 4 and I already typed in I don’t think I owe this debt and it took me back to step 3 of 4. Okay, so I gotta type it in again right.

Thoughts on review page: So I went through the review before submitting then it asks you for your full name before you can submit and it asks you if the information is true to the best of your knowledge and you have to click it to know you understand it then click submit it.

Confirmation page: you have 5 days and they will send a letter through the mail and an email so you can’t say you didn’t get it. If snail mail is to slow you have it in your email. It lets you know when it was submitted and you can print this page for your records. You still have to make the payments, then they will mail you a letter with the decision. Theres a number and then there’s go back to va.gov. It is very self-explanatory.

## **Post Task Questions (5 minutes)**
