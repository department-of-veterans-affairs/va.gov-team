## **Getting to know you (10 minutes)**

Welcome!

Thank you so much for your time today. My name is Charlotte and I work at VA.gov - it’s nice to meet you!

How are you today?

I work at VA.gov to help improve access to benefits and services for Veterans like you. This work is meaningful to me because I believe that those who have served have a right to these services. [meaning]

You’ll notice there are a few people on the call already. They’re my colleagues and they’re here to listen and to learn. Is that ok with you? [permission]

My goal today is to understand how usable and accessible an experience we’re working on is.

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

Next, I want to explain my role better.

I am a consultant for the VA and my role is to talk to Veterans like you to understand the challenges you face in the space of VA medical copay billing. I am gathering information to help improve the experience of managing or resolving your VA copay bills.

The limits of my role are that I am not the final decision maker on the experience nor am I a financial expert, but I can surface issues and challenges that come up in research to the VA.

Your comfort and well-being are very important to us.

Sensitive topics might come up, and if at any point you want to take a break, please let me know. If you want or need to stop the interview at any point, just let me know. [comfort and consent]

Your identity will be kept confidential, and any information we take away from the interview will be stored securely. [confidentiality]

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more. Yes

**Optional**:

One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like you’re on-screen image.

[Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA.]

At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.

Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences? Okay not a problem.

Do you have any questions for me?

Just want to ensure the next 75 minutes are still good for you today? Yes

**START INTERVIEW**

3-5 minutes

[Rapport building]

  
  

· We like to start off with a lighthearted question to get to know you better.

· What's your favorite thing about Spring? Well since the weather is just now clearing up I like doing a lot of things, even through the va. I have participated in a lot of groups and yesterday [name omitted] VA in [omitted] hosted a women’s appreciation get together day so I was invited to that and thank goodness patient travel picked me up because it’s a distance. I typically go to [name omitted] but they picked me up, took me, and brought me back home. I like going to women’s events, doesn’t even just have to be for women’s but I like attending the events. Theres a lot going on like this Sunday one in [location omitted]. I hope to participate in a lot of them this summer and I get those posts through the VA site. Theres a benefit seminar that’s coming up and there’s people from all over telling you what you can get through the va.

· Thank you for sharing! (personal response)

## **[Intro to study] (5 minutes)**

Now we’ll start the more formal interview.

Today I will be sharing a survey on VA.gov to help orient you to the right place depending on your unique situation with VA copays or VA debt.

## **Warm-up Questions - (3-5 minutes)**

Before we look at the design prototype, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

· What device are you using today? iPad

· Does the device you're using have a screen to share? I think I have done it before; I would have to turn voiceover back on to swipe through.

· What type of screenreader or other assistive technology are you using? (Voiceover? Something else?) Voiceover but when it is speaking I couldn’t hear you so I had to turn voiceover off. I can’t hear what you are saying when voiceover is on. They said if you tap it, it will stop but it doesn’t work. It used to work but now it doesn’t help and I am tapping more than once so now I don’t even bother with it. I have that with all of my classes. Voiceover say people put stuff in the class, you can’t hear the speaker because voiceover tells everything that’s in the chat and it doesn’t stop talking when I tap the screen.

· Normally use it on mobile or have you done it on desktop: I have voiceover on the computer but I use my iPad. I only sue the computer when I am filling out applications. If I need to sign up for something I do it on the computer. For my classes I use the iPad because I can carry it with me and lay in bed. I just need to swipe. I have to press the keys with the computer then I have to figure out where the keys are. The iPad is easier, swipe up/down/left/right when navigating through.

· How comfortable are you using your screenreader, how long have you been using it? I only use voiceover, I cant see the screen if voiceover doesn’t tell me where I am at then I don’t know where to go. It tells me where to link up and it tells me where to tap, if I didn’t have voiceover and I can’t hear it I cant hear it. I rely on voiceover to guide me through all devices because I can’t see. I have a portable reader as well and it reads my mail. If I didn’t have all of that I would have to wait on my kids to read everything for me. I used to use a magnifier but my vision got worse and now I have a screen reader. Thank goodness for the reader.

· How long: I started losing vision in 2011, it wasn’t the glasses that was the issue it was my eyes that were the issue. I had cataracts in 2011, I could see much better, I didn’t know it was that bad. As it progressed a year later it bothered me again. I started with voiceover once I came to the VA in 2015 and I went through the blind center and learned about the devices for visusally impaired individuals.

### Prototype (5 minutes)

Let’s go to the next part of the interview where we are going to share a digital experience we’re working on and ask for your feedback. A few things I want you to know:

You'll be interacting with a prototype that may not work exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. This is very important to know: since it's a demo, we have used fake information, and none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. In this task, we would like to hear your honest feedback. Please comment on what is clear and unclear.

I am going to drop a link in the Zoom chat. When you receive the link, please open the page. Send direct link to Debt Portal prototype Link: ([https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt](https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt)) [Mobile sessions screen share directions] [Sharing screen instructions as needed]

## **Conversation guide questions for intro pages paths**

**Manage Your VA Debt Page  
  
**

· What stands out to you on this page?

· [Task]

· Imagine you wanted to find links on this page to get help with VA overpayments and VA debts. Can you please explore the page and point out which links are to get help?

· How many links are there?

· [Task, if only found one link]

· Can you please find the link on the page to find out other ways to request help with VA debt? If I landed on the page I would scroll down and listen to what’s on the page. Let me go up to the top. That’s it. I must be at the end because it keeps repeating itself. It says they can contact us but did not provide a phone number. It said if I had questions about the issues you can reach to us and provided the times.

· Please click on the link

· Feedback: it was informative and I know some of the things. When it says bullet I assume it’s a period. Some of the stuff with the screen reader I ignore it because I know the setup now. It stops and says something then when you swipe you know you have to hear the rest. I noticed that a lot happened. It will say something and instead of finishing you have to swipe again to hear the rest of the sentence. Maybe they can only get so much on the page. I cant see it so I assume it’s the end of the page and that’s why you need to swipe again to hear the rest.

· Most use iPad: I use the iPad for me. Once I learned, because I went back to the blind center to go over the keyboard so I could go through the programs. Not everyone uses zoom, we use Webex and you get a lot of links to join in. some of these meetings they have a code and you have to enter the code and password. If it wasn’t in the link I wasn’t joining. I found it out with talking books they sent the link then enter code/password. I won’t remember the code or password to add to the link. If it’s not there where I can just tap and join like this that’s what I will do. If it’s too complicated then I will miss it or skip it so I don’t normally do it.

· I look for the exact words, sometimes voiceover doesn’t say the exact word so its good to know. It helps when people walk you through it step by step. If you give me a list of instructions I wont remember it in detail but if they walk you through step by step then you know you are in the right place. I have been trying to shut the screenreader up so I will need to ask. Double tap use to work but now it doesn’t with the iPad. They say just tap it but it doesn't work.

**Options to request help with VA debt (R&S page)**

· Please take some time to explore this page and let me know if you have any concerns

· What is clear?

· What is unclear?

· What are your thoughts on the amount of content on this page? Is it too much or just enough?

· Imagine you wanted to dispute an overpayment. Please show me where you might go to find information to help you dispute this overpayment.

· [Can they expand the menu?]

· How do you feel about the amount of information you had to review before finding this information to dispute your debt?

**Dispute Your Debt Form**

· Please take some time to go through this form, imagining you had to fill it out. I will quietly observe.

· Please pause at any areas on the pages where you have any concerns or feedback.

## **Post Task Questions (5 minutes)**

· What was your overall experience with the pages you reviewed?

· What are your thoughts on the amount of pages you had to review to be able to get to the Dispute Form? (AT specific Q)

· Was there any information missing?

· What would you change if anything? What can be improved? Was anything unclear?

<On this page> >> table of contents

Massive list of sections into different pages, easier for mobile pages

Easier to find controls – activate accordion, click thru content, before form link

· What was the easiest part if anything?

In the next few questions, I'm going to ask you to rate different aspects of the experience you reviewed today.

· The first is clarity, and how clear the information was on the experience. On a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being not clear at all, and 5 being very clear, how clear was the experience as a whole?

· The second is under stability, and how understandable the information was on the portal. On a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being not understandable at all, and 5 being very understandable, how understandable was the experience as a whole?

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it works well for all Veterans.
