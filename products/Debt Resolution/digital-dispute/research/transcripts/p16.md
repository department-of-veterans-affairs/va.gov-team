## **Getting to know you (10 minutes)**

Hello/Welcome

Thank you so much for your time today. My name is Charlotte and I work at VA.gov - it’s nice to meet you!

How are you today?

I work at VA.gov to help improve access to benefits and services for Veterans like you. This work is meaningful to me because I believe that those who have served have a right to these services. [meaning]

You’ll notice there are a few people on the call already. They’re my colleagues and they’re here to listen and to learn. Is that ok with you? [permission]

My goal today is to learn how easy or difficult it is to use a digital portal we are working on to help you understand how to resolve and resolve VA overpayment debts.

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

Next, I want to explain my role better.

I am a consultant for the VA and my role is to talk to Veterans like you to understand the challenges you face in the space of VA medical copay billing. I am gathering information to help improve the experience of managing or resolving your VA copay bills.

The limits of my role are that I am not the final decision maker on the experience nor am I a financial expert, but I can surface issues and challenges that come up in research to the VA.

Your comfort and well-being are very important to us.

Sensitive topics might come up, and if at any point you want to take a break, please let me know. If you want or need to stop the interview at any point, just let me know. [comfort and consent]

Your identity will be kept confidential, and any information we take away from the interview will be stored securely. [confidentiality]

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more. Yes ma’am.

_Optional_:

One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like you’re on-screen image.

[Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA.]

At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.

Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences? Sure that’s fine.

Do you have any questions for me? No ma’am

I want to make sure the next 60 minutes are still good for you today? Yes ma’am  
  

### **START INTERVIEW**

## **Warm-up**  
[Rapport building]

● We like to start off with a lighthearted question to get to know you better.

● What’s something you enjoy doing these days—any hobbies or routines? OR What's your favorite thing about Spring? I haven’t really started anything new, I do the same things but I don’t need to go to work so I get to help my wife out now. I like football but the games are expensive so it is cheaper to watch them at home and with my anxiety its just  easier to do it at home. 

● Thank you for sharing! (personal response)

### **Baseline [5 minutes]**

● Can you briefly tell me what your most recent experience with VA overpayment debt has been and when it appeared? [establish baseline] I don’t remember the date but it was within the last year or two. The debt was due to being in national guard and  applied for disability but I was still working so I had a debt to pay due to them giving me back pay. Well no you don’t know, you put the benefits in and don’t know if you will get it. The backpay overlapped with my working schedule. They back paid me for the disability and I had been working during that time. You cant predict the future so you don’t know if you will get the benefits.

● What, if any, actions have you taken to understand or resolve this debt? The amount I owed wasn’t adding up so I had my drill schedule and sent it back into DFAS because I was on drill. I still had to pay but not as much.

● In 1-3 words, what words would you use to describe the process of understanding and resolving your debt in your experience so far? It was kind of easy; you can’t do anything about it you just have to pay. They sent a letter and you sent the money each month. Online payments.

## **Warm-up Questions - (3-5 minutes)**

Before we look at the design prototype, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

● What device are you using today?

● Does the device you're using have a screen to share?

● What type of screenreader or other assistive technology are you using? (Voiceover? Something else?)

● How comfortable are you using your screenreader, how long have you been using it?

### **Prototype (5 minutes)**

Let’s go to the next part of the interview where we are going to share a digital experience we’re working on and ask for your feedback. A few things I want you to know:

You'll be interacting with a prototype that may not work exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. This is very important to know: since it's a demo, we have used fake information, and none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. In this task, we would like to hear your honest feedback. Please comment on what is clear and unclear.

I am going to drop a link in the Zoom chat. When you receive the link, please open the page. Send direct link to Debt Portal prototype Link: ([https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt](https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt)) [Mobile sessions screen share directions] [Sharing screen instructions as needed]

### **Manage your VA debt for benefit overpayments and copay bills [**[**page**](https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt)**] [2-3 minutes]**

● Does this page look familiar to you? Yes ma’am. I saw this on Monday. I was trying to go in to cancel my dad’s VA appointment.

Everything is labeled and the questions are highlighted and you can click the hyperlinks if you don’t want to scroll. It has contact information if you need to ask questions. One thing I prefer is the agent that you can chat with so the little box here. I would use that before I use the phone number. I used it to cancel his appointment but I wasn’t able to use it because it wasn’t on the phone. It would be good to have the chatbot at all times. When you call you wait and talk to customer service then have to wait and it hangs up. I called at 8 said it was closed and called right back and it said the va system was down. You call the 800 number and it said it was down. I tried to use the chatbot but couldn’t find it, I could find it in the past. Once I finished all that and he was late to his appointment. Chatbot I am satisfied with when I can use it.

● Given your current or recent situation, what are you most interested in on this page? [Mental Models] The payment amount and how to do it online would be interesting to me. Yes I knew it was there. The information was in the bill/statement that they sent me.

● Take a moment to show me where on the page you would go to get help with your debt [task]. In this section right here request help or click the hyperlink.

● I’d like to bring you attention to the ‘Request Financial Help section. [comprehension]

● What are your thoughts about this page? Any information missing that you’d like to see? It looks fine, everything is there that you would want. You should be able to answer all of your questions in the first wo paragraphs.

● Where on this page would you click on if you wanted help with your debt? Can you point out which links, specifically? It would be this one request help with overpayment debt online or the one where it says learn more about the va debt

● Before you click, what do you understand to be the difference between the first link <[Request help with overpayments and copay bills online](https://zyc78g.csb.app/request-help)> and the second <[Learn about other ways to request help with VA debt](https://zyc78g.csb.app/help-options)> [Mental Models]the second one would be like debt forgiveness or reduce fee. Or something like that. That to be would be more asking for help and you put your information in and then get back to you or give you a number to call.

● Which link would you most interested in clicking on first? Why? The first one to request help.

● Please click on the link: expected to see this. It looks good. It gives you all of the information you need right up front and what you need to have so you can take a screenshot and get the information then fill it out and send it out. You don’t need to run around to get stuff you have it all together.

● Know it existed: yes

● Click second like.

## **Introductory pages and R&S page (orientation and wayfinding)**

● [Relate or make a connection to what they shared earlier in baseline section about experience resolving their debt]

● Please take some time to browse through this page. Please remember to think aloud

This one is pretty good it gives you everything you need and you can click on it and it gives more information that you can click on and tells you what you could qualify for. Even the Stem scholarship, I never heard that before. If you have kids that you could have gotten the stem debt from that. It is all right here for you, someone has probably taken advantage of a program and you can see it here.

Debt spelled  out is helpful: yes you don’t need to search around everything is right there.

● What stands out to you?

● What questions do you have after reviewing this page, if any?

● Which option would you say is relevant to your situation? The first one. This on request repayment plan. The bill was from less than 5 years ago so it would be this one.

● Thoughts: The normal thing, hyperlink for contact information then the billing address as well.

● Click on below: It gives you the advantage to get help online and give you that option as help. The second one is spelled out and gives you the form that you need to fill out.

● Appeal differences: You might want to change the boxes to a different color or darken them up some because they blend in with the background. Maybe a blue or darker grey. The wavier is ask for them to overlook it with new evidence whereas in my case they said I worked more than I did, I had the schedule so I was able to get it reduced. I guess that’s the one I would have used. It was key in getting it reduced, they said I was working more than what I was. I worked 2 days a month then 2 weeks a year.

● How to file: online or in the mail and you have a year to contest the claim. You only have two different ways.

● Can you show me where you might look if you want to see if there is a process to let the VA know that you shouldn’t have this debt? [task: finding dispute section]  Need help section they give you the number or you could do the automated form to send it in and they call you back. You would click dispute for over payment and you can do it online.

● If unclear, give a bit more guidance [partial pass]

● Based on what it says here, what is important to know about disputing overpayment debt? You have 30 days before it goes into collections and it gives you the timeframe so I like that information.

● Missing: Um. You could give an example of the evidence they look for could be placed here like bank statements. Specific examples of what you would take.

● What could happen after 30 days if you don't make any payments on your debt? It goes into collections. [correct answer: could be sent to collections]

● Do you have any questions or concerns after reading this paragraph?

## **Dispute Form**

Before we move on to this next section, I have some questions about the pages you just reviewed.

## **‘Wizard’ Post Task Questions (5 minutes)**

● What was your overall experience with the pages you reviewed until this point?

● How did you feel while finding this form? Were there any moments where you felt frustrated or overwhelmed? If so, why? It was oaky just make the colors a little darker because the colors run together. No frustration with the page.

● What would you change if anything? What can be improved? Was anything unclear?

● We want to know your thoughts on how easy or difficult the experience you reviewed is. When you answer this question, think about how easily you would find information you are most interested in

● On a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being not easy at all, and 5 being very easy, how easy were the pages you reviewed? 5, because everything is right there in order. Payments, get help and if you have a dispute. All of your answers are already answered and in order. You would have the information needed if you needed to call. Pages were a 4, because there’s always room for improvement that’s why I would say a 4.

● Why did you rate it a (rating)?

## **Digital Dispute Intro page**

● What are your thoughts on this page? The note is good; it is blue and stands out. You can start the process and save it to come back later. It is a good feature that it saves the progress.

● Missing: It tells you that you can only go overpayments not copay and gives the notes from the other page and the help section looks good.

● Is anything unclear?

● Do you have any concerns after reading this paragraph?

### **Prompt**

● Please go ahead and go through this form, imagining you were filling this form out. I want to remind you that the information filled out in this demo is fake information.

● Please remember to talk aloud and point out anything that is unclear or confusing

● I’ll stop you if I have follow up questions  
[Reason for dispute page]

Maybe in this section for personal information if you have to call to update have it so that you can update it yourself. Veterans don’t want to call the va so if we can do it on our end that would be easier so add it so the user can fix it instead of calling. The information here you can edit it so can you change it here. Sometimes you can edit certain things like name or address.

Thoughts on debts: I like that it shows where the debt is coming from and when you need to contact them by. Very helpful. Like I said if you need to get information and busy you can make an appointment to go get it or look for it, you aren’t rushed.

I see the total so I would click this one and it gives the information. It would be nice if you click I don’t think I owe it that it would come up with more information. It says what the bill is, how did you come up with that total. The GI bill send that out, we don’t pay it, they send it to use so how did we occur the debt. More information on how they came up with the debt, date range, overpayments, refund check form the school. Telling us why we owe the debt.

● Do any of these reasons apply to you? Which one would you select and why? Yes  it would be I don’t think I owe the debt.

Put in a description why I don’t owe it or more information. I guess I would ask for a statement so I see how I got the debt telling me why I owe the bill. Then do the same thing for this one.  
[Reason for dispute page - entry field]

● What type of information would you include in this section?

[ Review and submit page]: Put name in and certify it’s you and click to submit.

Thoughts: It is what I would expect tis not filler its straight to the point, gives a break down and the reason you owe a debt is due to the ssn being off by a number. So it shows this is what they are going off of.

Also where it says print the page, have another option so you can email it. A lot of people don’t have printers so being able to print it or save it to the site or something or both options. A lot of people don’t have printers. It gives you what to expect next so they’d look it over and it would take about 6 months then send a letter, just kidding the letter comes pretty fast, I would say it came in 2 weeks. They send correspondence quick through email or snail mail its just the phone that’s terrible. We just need to scrap the customer service thing you’ll take 30-40 minutes then it will hang-up on you. The help text box is key.

● Do they expand the accordion?

● Any concerns on this page?

### **DIGITAL DISPUTE MENTAL MODELS**

● Now that you've gone through this form, I'd like to take some time to reflect and hear about how your experience was today. Please only comment on your experience with the form.

● How did you feel while completing this form? Were there any moments where you felt frustrated or overwhelmed? If so, why? It was good it is self-explanatory the colors need fix but other than that it was pretty good. No frustration, I just couldn’t find information because it blended in due to the colors. Even with the gray and light blue, it doesn’t popout. The green helps.

● Do you feel confident about what actions you need to take next? Pretty confident wait on the mail to know they got it and it is processing. Instead you could come here and they could send progress here instead of waiting and you could see the status. Letting the veteran check it would be good.

● Did you know this option to resolve your debt existed? Yes ma’am, when I had my debt it was on the site so I could dispute it.

● Have you encountered something similar to this process before?

● How does this compare? It is about the same I just didn’t know about the scholarships but things change every 30 days with the VA.

● What did you expect to see on this form that wasn’t there if anything? Was anything missing?

● When you answer this next question, think about how easily you would be able to fill out this form

● On a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being not easy at all, and 5 being very easy, how easy to understand fill out was this form? 5, it was pretty easy.

● Why did you rate it a (rating)?

## **Whole Experience Post Task Questions (5 minutes)**

● Now thinking about the experience from start to finish, how was your experience? Was anything difficult? Was anything easy? It was a good experience the information was right there I didn’t have to search for it there were good bullets.

● What would you change if anything? What can be improved? Was anything unclear? The help box, colors need to be changed.

Those are all the questions that I had for you today.

## **Permission to use clips with internal VA partners**

● Circling back about the optional use of clips with internal VA partners. Now that you know what we’ve discussed, are you still comfortable with this? Yes ma’am that’s fine.

● Do you have any questions for me or is there anything else that you think that I should know? No ma’am that was it.

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it works well for all Veterans.

**[End of session]**

## **Emergency Exit**

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so it’s easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
