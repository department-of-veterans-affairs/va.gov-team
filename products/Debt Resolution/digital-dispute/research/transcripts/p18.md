## **Getting to know you (10 minutes)**

Hello/Welcome

Thank you so much for your time today. My name is Charlotte and I work at VA.gov - it’s nice to meet you!

How are you today?

I work at VA.gov to help improve access to benefits and services for Veterans like you. This work is meaningful to me because I believe that those who have served have a right to these services. [meaning]

You’ll notice there are a few people on the call already. They’re my colleagues and they’re here to listen and to learn. Is that ok with you? [permission]

My goal today is to learn how easy or difficult it is to use a digital portal we are working on to help you understand how to resolve and resolve VA overpayment debts.

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

Next, I want to explain my role better.

I am a consultant for the VA and my role is to talk to Veterans like you to understand the challenges you face in the space of VA medical copay billing. I am gathering information to help improve the experience of managing or resolving your VA copay bills.

The limits of my role are that I am not the final decision maker on the experience nor am I a financial expert, but I can surface issues and challenges that come up in research to the VA.

Your comfort and well-being are very important to us.

Sensitive topics might come up, and if at any point you want to take a break, please let me know. If you want or need to stop the interview at any point, just let me know. [comfort and consent]

Your identity will be kept confidential, and any information we take away from the interview will be stored securely. [confidentiality]

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more. Sure, that’s fine.

_Optional_:

One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like you’re on-screen image.

[Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA.]

At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.

Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences? Only in context, I have been taken out of context before so it needs to be related to the issue we are speaking about and not taken out of context. Okay. Yes.

Do you have any questions for me? Not at this point.

I want to make sure the next 60 minutes are still good for you today? Yes.  
  

### **START INTERVIEW**

## **Warm-up**  
[Rapport building]

● We like to start off with a lighthearted question to get to know you better.

● What’s something you enjoy doing these days—any hobbies or routines? OR What's your favorite thing about Spring? Um gardening, succulents because they grow and thrive and don’t talk back. Oh they are great because they just want to thrive it doesn’t really matter the season. 

● Thank you for sharing! (personal response)

### **Baseline [5 minutes]**

● Can you briefly tell me what your most recent experience with VA overpayment debt has been and when it appeared? [establish baseline] Um the most recent was as a result of the bill that talked about the GI Bill and payments. It came out of the blue because I didn’t know about it. I used the GI Bill and I was paying on my own but I was told I fell into a new category that the education should have been paid for. 2022 was the last class I attended. Yes, it remains unclear. My concern is that there is no formula that I can use to figure out how much my entitlement is and how much I owe or they owe. I got a letter in the mail.

● Feelings: Well first I thought it was a mistake then annoyed due to the drama in 2022 I had trying to get it fixed then they recalculated and gave me money. I didn’t touch the money because at some point they are going to figure it out because I couldn’t. It was a surprise and shock because I thought it was a past part of my life.

● What, if any, actions have you taken to understand or resolve this debt? I am a tech person and understand people have constraints. I try to reach out in a messaging system because there isn’t always someone available. I went to AskVA and submitted a questions and they told me it was correct. Within a week the money was taken away again and AskVA is unreliable. I called the benefits number and waited half the day on hold. I talked to someone and they said I can request a recalculation and I will get a letter. I got the letter and they said it was an overpayment. This is now the third exchange of payment. I got the money before the letter, then they said they owe me something. I just don’t want to deal with it anymore and I have better things to do than stress with it. It feels unresolved. I feel like I owe the government money because this money was from 2022. They were adamant they you will run out of money and I didn’t want to deal with it. I started paying and they stopped. I didn’t finish because I ran out of money. I just started hanging out with my plants. I’m too old to deal with this and then started happening. I feel like it is unresolved. I re-enrolled to finish the certificate on my own then be done with it so there’s not a sword over my head. The va paid both me and the school, I paid for the school so I have an overpayment and the school has an overpayment. I figure the va will come back and get it for the rest of my life.

● In 1-3 words, what words would you use to describe the process of understanding and resolving your debt in your experience so far? Impossible, everyone I talk to has a different method and no one comes out with the same figure or tell me how they get it. I think it is based on the analyst because there’s no key or verify if it is right or wrong. Frustrating and scary because poof I have money then taken back then given back again. The fact the va can touch my money without notification is scary. The numbers didn’t match and it was impossible to understand. I am smart but I couldn’t figure it out. VA math is beyond my understanding.

## **Warm-up Questions - (3-5 minutes)**

Before we look at the design prototype, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

● What device are you using today?

● Does the device you're using have a screen to share?

● What type of screenreader or other assistive technology are you using? (Voiceover? Something else?)

● How comfortable are you using your screenreader, how long have you been using it?

### **Prototype (5 minutes)**

Let’s go to the next part of the interview where we are going to share a digital experience we’re working on and ask for your feedback. A few things I want you to know:

You'll be interacting with a prototype that may not work exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. This is very important to know: since it's a demo, we have used fake information, and none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. In this task, we would like to hear your honest feedback. Please comment on what is clear and unclear.

I am going to drop a link in the Zoom chat. When you receive the link, please open the page. Send direct link to Debt Portal prototype Link: ([https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt](https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt)) [Mobile sessions screen share directions] [Sharing screen instructions as needed]

### **Manage your VA debt for benefit overpayments and copay bills [**[**page**](https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt)**] [2-3 minutes]**

● Does this page look familiar to you? No.

SO there is a lot of help here but what I am looking for is the computation methodology. If I am entitled to 36 months, there’s nothing on how to compute those months. I know there’s other information on va.gov where it tells you what you get but doesn’t define what it is. Full time is different depending where you go. For me there’s 2 terms and 1 compressed term in the summer. It is a 1.5-month term. If you go full time you cant go twice full time. I would be looking for the definition of full time and how  many credits equal what and then the percentage of BAH. I have never found the data. I would like to do it to so I can verify it is the same number the va got. I understand it’s a bill but how was it overpaid and what was it. I got a letter and what I owe but not how they computed. I know I can pay and go through to make payments but the backend isn’t transparent.

The header stands out. It says manage va debt for4 benefits overpayment and copay it pouts me on the defensive because I don’t owe money I don’t think its right.

What if it says manage or understand your va debt: I wouldn’t put your because it may not be my debt. Maybe put how to understand VA debt and computation. Why put me on the defensive right away. I would assume when I sign in it has all of the information for me. I have signed in and viewed it. That’s when I still got that I owe money and here’s how you pay it back. The debt was wrong it was another figure from the one that was quoted on the phone and from the letter. Since it was different, recently I decided to put it in a folder and not deal with it until something else happens. I really think I owe the va so I just put it aside because they will come get it.

What else stands out: Who can sign in, only veterans and servicemembers. What if we have someone to act on our behalf. Helpful for them to be able to sign in. All of this on what you can do, I am aware and I have done that so I can see how much the va has overpaid me in my mind but not on how they overpaid me or how they came up with the numbers. The why isn’t there. The why is there, because they didn’t pay the amount your were deserved but that is still confusing . its not just the why, it’s the why and how it was computed. The random amount of money in my bank then to the college makes me go mmhh.

● Given your current or recent situation, what are you most interested in on this page? [Mental Models]

● Take a moment to show me where on the page you would go to get help with your debt [task]

● I’d like to bring you attention to the ‘Request Financial Help section. [comprehension]

● What are your thoughts about this page? Any information missing that you’d like to see?

● Where on this page would you click on if you wanted help with your debt? Can you point out which links, specifically?

● Help sections thoughts: So I like think these are true for you I would bold ALL to emphasize it. This repayment plan of 5 years or debt relief is that pay over 5 years or pay something from more than 5 years ago. It is unclear based on wording. Over 2 years for me would make sense because the debt was from 2 years ago. It wouldn’t occur to me someone who needed 5 years to pay back. No debt comes back to ask if you need more than 5 years to pay off the debt you need to look at how much the payments would be. Maybe put request extended payment plan instead of 5 years. I get the debt relief because it’s a waiver. If you need to request an extended payment plan. It is here to when you click the link for the form so that flows to the next window. In my case I don’t know this form but is this a requirement because I am retired so I don’t work. Maybe you would want to put pension there. Theres nothing that talks about pension or monthly income, it could fall under other resources. All veterans and some of them might have a pension so maybe include that. Older veterans like me have pensions, are those considered income. I am not sure what it means they won’t take collections on home assets, yes they will absolutely do that. Maybe rephrase that. This is pretty straight forward for the forms. Extended payment more than 5 years.

● Before you click, what do you understand to be the difference between the first link <[Request help with overpayments and copay bills online](https://zyc78g.csb.app/request-help)> and the second <[Learn about other ways to request help with VA debt](https://zyc78g.csb.app/help-options)> [Mental Models] Second link maybe other ways besides the one above. This goes back to how to get help with debt. Initially we wouldn’t be talking about attorney fees , that wouldn’t be an overpayment. It shouldn’t be on this page; the VA doesn’t pay attorney fees do they. I don’t think so. That stood out there.

● Which link would you most interested in clicking on first? Why?

● Please click on the link

## **Introductory pages and R&S page (orientation and wayfinding)**

● [Relate or make a connection to what they shared earlier in baseline section about experience resolving their debt]

● Please take some time to browse through this page. Please remember to think aloud

I am not disputing a debt owed to the va. This is confusing because the initial like is dispute your overpayment. I think this means the overpayment the va paid me but in this case it’s the other way. I think the debt, the VA’s debt not mine. I am disputing the VA’s overpayment to me. I think this is correct like the va overpaid me and not they are trying to collect it. I am probably the minority, I don’t think many people earned money from the VA that thinks it is an error.

Term for your situation: Maybe a link at the bottom, it needs to be taken out of the scrolling. This is like I owe money. Maybe it could say do you think the VA overpaid you on the bottom. I don’t know how many people are in this situation. In the chat rooms, no one has done this before. Tried to give money back to the va. I kept asking what do I do when I think the va overpaid me and calculate it in error. They keep saying hold on to it, they will come back for it.

● What stands out to you?

● What questions do you have after reviewing this page, if any?

● Which option would you say is relevant to your situation? It would go back to dispute overpayment so I would go back there. Again we have been there and it’s about what I owe the va. I would think that would apply but it doesn’t. Submit supplemental claims, board review or higher-level review. Yeah this would work. It’s the wrong form but yeah. That’s what I would do. This is the form I need. Got it. In this case it would be other than disability. Oh, you cant do it online. This link says you can do it online but this landing page says you cant and you have to di it online. Theres a download and an address to mail it to. Can you do it online. I don’t know but in this case it shows that you cannot do it online. Put something here that states you cannot do it online here’s the pdf form.

● Can you show me where you might look if you want to see if there is a process to let the VA know that you shouldn’t have this debt? [task: finding dispute section]

● If unclear, give a bit more guidance [partial pass]

● Based on what it says here, what is important to know about disputing overpayment debt?

● What could happen after 30 days if you don't make any payments on your debt? [correct answer: could be sent to collections]

● Do you have any questions or concerns after reading this paragraph?

## **Dispute Form**

Before we move on to this next section, I have some questions about the pages you just reviewed.

## **‘Wizard’ Post Task Questions (5 minutes)**

● What was your overall experience with the pages you reviewed until this point?

● How did you feel while finding this form? Were there any moments where you felt frustrated or overwhelmed? If so, why?

● What would you change if anything? What can be improved? Was anything unclear?

● We want to know your thoughts on how easy or difficult the experience you reviewed is. When you answer this question, think about how easily you would find information you are most interested in

● On a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being not easy at all, and 5 being very easy, how easy were the pages you reviewed?

● Why did you rate it a (rating)?

## **Digital Dispute Intro page**

● What are your thoughts on this page?

● Is anything unclear?

● Do you have any concerns after reading this paragraph?

### **Prompt**

● Please go ahead and go through this form, imagining you were filling this form out. I want to remind you that the information filled out in this demo is fake information.

● This is interactive so anything here effects my profile right. These two blocks are the assumed debt to the va. If I go here, there I don’t think I owe this. I like that.

● What would you put in here: I would add some buttons here then a comment box. Have an option to say I am disputing because inaccurate mode. It talks about not owning the debt and this is why I think I don’t owe this debt. See I can’t dispute something I don’t know. I assume this would be the BAH that I am paid during school. I can say the figure is wrong and here is the correct figure. I could say it was justly earned because I was going to school but then it goes to how do I compute the figure.

● What buttons would you like here: I think it applies to BAH paid to you while going to school. The dollar figure doesn’t explain what it is. I get BAH while going to school, that’s easy I know the rate and when I went to school. This would match BAH in any place. I would assume it would be part of a month. Like do you calculate for bah for 14 days. It doesn’t go month to month. To calculate how much it was overpaid I would need to know what it represents. Maybe instead of this , it could have the check box and explanation and sub box based on payment of BAH in the amount of 2K for 10 months while going to school. Prorated for when. There needs to be an explanation of the figure. The debt it doesn’t matter what it’s for because I don’t know what it is for. If I know I have a car payment and you miss a month that’s easy. In this case I don’t know what this figure means so I would click  on that to request help, well where’s the help. Where’s the pay part but where is the pay part. I can pay or request help by. Where’s the button to request help and what kind of help. Maybe this would be a good part to understand how to request time to understand the figure.

● I am confused I am in a loop here. Okay I am paying or requesting help, amount of debt dispute, the amount is incorrect, click continue then I am at reason number 2. I am back in this loop it does it twice. It goes back to number 3 twice. Enter the data, enter information then it goes back to number 3 again.

● Please remember to talk aloud and point out anything that is unclear or confusing

● I’ll stop you if I have follow up questions  
[Reason for dispute page]

● Do any of these reasons apply to you? Which one would you select and why?  
[Reason for dispute page - entry field]

● What type of information would you include in this section?

[ Review and submit page]: The comment populates to this block right. Yeah this is easy. I verified this one. It is clear the statement. Again it will cause a bunch of work with the open-ended comment someone will need to research. Then maybe they will provide another reason why it is that figure. In my case maybe this is what I should do. Submit.

The dispute letter, where does it goes into my profile. Like an open dispute like in the app and online it shows the status of your disability claim. When it was filed, where it is and the letter. It walks you through the process. It would be helpful for this as well and if you can lay it out like the disability as well. You can follow along and compare then together. If this is in the profile with any other format it will be confusing.

● Do they expand the accordion?

● Any concerns on this page?

### **DIGITAL DISPUTE MENTAL MODELS**

● Now that you've gone through this form, I'd like to take some time to reflect and hear about how your experience was today. Please only comment on your experience with the form.

● How did you feel while completing this form? Were there any moments where you felt frustrated or overwhelmed? If so, why?

● Do you feel confident about what actions you need to take next?

● Did you know this option to resolve your debt existed?

● Have you encountered something similar to this process before?

● How does this compare?

● What did you expect to see on this form that wasn’t there if anything? Was anything missing?

● When you answer this next question, think about how easily you would be able to fill out this form

● On a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being not easy at all, and 5 being very easy, how easy to understand fill out was this form?

● Why did you rate it a (rating)?

## **Whole Experience Post Task Questions (5 minutes)**

● Now thinking about the experience from start to finish, how was your experience? Was anything difficult? Was anything easy? It’s frustrating, it doesn’t make sense. Like this last one request higher level review online. If you can’t do it online it should say that but it doesn’t. It says you can do it online. It should say you cannot do it online here’s a fillable form. This whole thing is targeted toward people that owe the VA funds that they need to repay somehow it doesn’t encompass my situation. I think because I an in the minority and it doesn’t happen much, someone thinking they were paid to much and what to give it back. Maybe have a section where if its not covered here. Here it has AskVA but I already did that. Maybe have another box, situation not covered above.

● What would you change if anything? What can be improved? Was anything unclear?

Those are all the questions that I had for you today.

## **Permission to use clips with internal VA partners**

● Circling back about the optional use of clips with internal VA partners. Now that you know what we’ve discussed, are you still comfortable with this? Sure.

● Do you have any questions for me or is there anything else that you think that I should know? No but thank you so much for doing this and testing it before going live.

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it works well for all Veterans.

**[End of session]**

## **Emergency Exit**

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so it’s easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
