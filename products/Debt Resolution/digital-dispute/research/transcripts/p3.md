## **Getting to know you (10 minutes)**

Hello/Welcome

Thank you so much for your time today. My name is Charlotte and I work at VA.gov - it’s nice to meet you!

How are you today?

I work at VA.gov to help improve access to benefits and services for Veterans like you. This work is meaningful to me because I believe that those who have served have a right to these services. [meaning]

You’ll notice there are a few people on the call already. They’re my colleagues and they’re here to listen and to learn. Is that ok with you? [permission]

My goal today is to learn how easy or difficult it is to use a digital portal we are working on to help you understand how to resolve and resolve VA overpayment debts.

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

Next, I want to explain my role better.

I am a consultant for the VA and my role is to talk to Veterans like you to understand the challenges you face in the space of VA medical copay billing. I am gathering information to help improve the experience of managing or resolving your VA copay bills.

The limits of my role are that I am not the final decision maker on the experience nor am I a financial expert, but I can surface issues and challenges that come up in research to the VA.

Your comfort and well-being are very important to us.

Sensitive topics might come up, and if at any point you want to take a break, please let me know. If you want or need to stop the interview at any point, just let me know. [comfort and consent]

Your identity will be kept confidential, and any information we take away from the interview will be stored securely. [confidentiality]

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more. Yes I am.

_Optional_:

One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like you’re on-screen image.

[Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA.]

At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.

Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences? I would be comfortable, yes.

Do you have any questions for me? Um no, no questions right now.

I want to make sure the next 60 minutes are still good for you today? Yes.  
  

### **START INTERVIEW**

## **Warm-up**  
[Rapport building]

● We like to start off with a lighthearted question to get to know you better.

● What’s something you enjoy doing these days—any hobbies or routines? OR What's your favorite thing about Spring? Yeah I like something I enjoy doing is walking, I have gotten back into it like going through the park. I walk if I have the time instead of the bus. It helps me slow down. I have the [omitted] personality where you don’t pay attention to what’s going on so I walk to slow myself down and enjoy what is around me. I live in [omitted]  and I was born/raised here. I remind myself sometimes that when I go somewhere else it takes me a few days to adjust so I walk fast everywhere and it’s like people look at me like I’m running somewhere. Walking has helped me slow down and enjoy what’s around me.

● Thank you for sharing! (personal response)

### **Baseline [5 minutes]**

● Can you briefly tell me what your most recent experience with VA overpayment debt has been and when it appeared? [establish baseline] Yeah recently appeared in the last 6 months and its an overpayment of 495/500. I am in the process of disputing it because I think it is an error. It is daunting but I dealt with something similar 2 years ago and it was resolved but it was a lot of back and fourth.

● What was the most daunting: just because it was going through the process and I know what I went back for before. I  had to do it twice because it was correct and the back and fourth when it is rechallenged. The process can be long and daunting if you have to go back and forth.

● What, if any, actions have you taken to understand or resolve this debt? Combination of going through the online process, filling out and communication with then then phone calls and I called my local office and communicated that way then had to send things through the mail. The most recent one was 6 months ago.

● In 1-3 words, what words would you use to describe the process of understanding and resolving your debt in your experience so far? 

Frustrating, confusing, or not knowing what the best course of action is. They claim that they overpaid me for Veteran benefits. From that there was a miscalculation of what I could get sent. They are claiming it should be a lower amount so it was an overpayment. I don’t think it is correct, I think it was part of my original benefit letter. I think I received the correct amount and the debt is an error.

## **Warm-up Questions - (3-5 minutes)**

Before we look at the design prototype, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

● What device are you using today?

● Does the device you're using have a screen to share?

● What type of screenreader or other assistive technology are you using? (Voiceover? Something else?)

● How comfortable are you using your screenreader, how long have you been using it?

### **Prototype (5 minutes)**

Let’s go to the next part of the interview where we are going to share a digital experience we’re working on and ask for your feedback. A few things I want you to know:

You'll be interacting with a prototype that may not work exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. This is very important to know: since it's a demo, we have used fake information, and none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. In this task, we would like to hear your honest feedback. Please comment on what is clear and unclear.

I am going to drop a link in the Zoom chat. When you receive the link, please open the page. Send direct link to Debt Portal prototype Link: ([https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt](https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt)) [Mobile sessions screen share directions] [Sharing screen instructions as needed]

### **Manage your VA debt for benefit overpayments and copay bills [**[**page**](https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt)**] [2-3 minutes]**

● Does this page look familiar to you? Yes it does. I saw it when I came here 2 years ago as a resource to find my next steps.

● Process: I went to the next steps or who I could contact, did that and spoke with them and they broke it down. Then I did an appeal on it and went through the appeal process.

● They have the topic break down, then you can sign in with your information. Theres an option to directly pay and here’s the link, then pay copay here, they are direct links to pay online. Then it shows how to can repay the debt, financial help as well. You can request help and there’s an opportunity to submit for help with overpayment/copays. Theres direct links, submit reports, so that’s what I am see here.

● Anything new: it has been awhile; I see the dispute. Then the links to pay or request help.

● Given your current or recent situation, what are you most interested in on this page? [Mental Models]  The section for dispute the va overpayments, I assume once clicked on I would sign in to my va account then fill out the form to dispute the debt.

● Take a moment to show me where on the page you would go to get help with your debt [task] request help with overpayment or copay, debt relief, comprise offer, or waiver. Theres a lot the learn other ways to request help with va debt.

● I’d like to bring you attention to the ‘Request Financial Help section. [comprehension]

● What are your thoughts about this page? Any information missing that you’d like to see?

● Where on this page would you click on if you wanted help with your debt? Can you point out which links, specifically?

● Before you click, what do you understand to be the difference between the first link <[Request help with overpayments and copay bills online](https://zyc78g.csb.app/request-help)> and the second <[Learn about other ways to request help with VA debt](https://zyc78g.csb.app/help-options)> [Mental Models] the other one is general on how to request help and then this one is specifically to submit a status report. The other one is more of an article style on how to ask help instead of submitting the report.

● Which link would you most interested in clicking on first? Why? Just these two or overall, the one to dispute va overpayment because it directly correlates on what I want to do.

● Please click on the link: it took me to the form and takes me right to it and it is for debt or overpayment and you can start the dispute. I am already logged in so that makes sense if not I would have to login.

● Feelings: I like it because it is direct, somethings the site can be daunting but this is direct and I knew what to expect when I clicked here. It meet expectations.

● Compare to current knowledge: it feels like it will be more direct because I am brought right here.

## **Introductory pages and R&S page (orientation and wayfinding)**

● [Relate or make a connection to what they shared earlier in baseline section about experience resolving their debt]

● Please take some time to browse through this page. Please remember to think aloud

● What stands out to you? I like that it is clear and not to word, it is directly to the core information.

● Time limit: 1 year form first debt letter, I already knew that.

● Concerns: no because it says you still have to make payments while you are disputing it to avoid collections.

● What questions do you have after reviewing this page, if any?

● Which option would you say is relevant to your situation?

● Can you show me where you might look if you want to see if there is a process to let the VA know that you shouldn’t have this debt? [task: finding dispute section]

● If unclear, give a bit more guidance [partial pass]

● Based on what it says here, what is important to know about disputing overpayment debt?

● What could happen after 30 days if you don't make any payments on your debt? [correct answer: could be sent to collections]

● Do you have any questions or concerns after reading this paragraph?

## **Dispute Form**

Before we move on to this next section, I have some questions about the pages you just reviewed.

This makes sense because it is personal to me. Then it is a recap of that and I would click continue and you see the steps at the top. It is a 4-step process. Reviewing information and I can edit it if needed, click continue. Now it breaks down the debts to dispute, I can select all or just one. I like that it says when I need to do it by so in this case it was nov 1 2024. So I would need to pay or request help by then. It gives you an idea of when it falls into that year timeline so the process has be done before that date.

Your date: I was informed because I knew it was a 1-year limit.

I would click on whichever or both then go into this section on why you dispute. Then the third option is to ask for help or a wavier if you can’t pay it, I like it’s a reminder incase it is for financial hardship. If this was me I don’t think I owe this debt then click continue then enter in a reason here.

What information: I would go based on my original  benefits letter and contesting that and what I was promised there shouldn’t have been overpayment with dates included

Anything you want to see: an example of what kind of information is key so you know what to include here. Then you can expand these so you know how it is broken down and then basically sure the information is correct, sign my name and the confirm and submit. I would like to see the option to edit the dispute statement to change it here so you don’t need to go back that’s the only thing though. It says it is in process and the email will be sent out and I will get a physical letter as well.

Confident on next steps: it says it is in progress and what it looks like. What could be helpful is that the what to expect would be further up on the back, maybe directly under in progress so I read it and see what’s going on. Basically it outlines the timeline, the timeline would be nice for a rough idea. Like form submits and 5 days then on average it takes but note it could take longer then decision made.

## **‘Wizard’ Post Task Questions (5 minutes)**

● What was your overall experience with the pages you reviewed until this point?

● How did you feel while finding this form? Were there any moments where you felt frustrated or overwhelmed? If so, why? It was nice it was brief and I knew the number of steps. I wish there were an example for the information to include in the statement. It would be nice to know what to included and what to expect to make sure I ensure everything so I don’t need to go back to add things I could’ve done first. I know where to start and I like the process because it is clear and direct. I think it eliminates the time and it is clear, easier, more convenient. Thats what I think of when it comes to this.

● What would you change if anything? What can be improved? Was anything unclear? I think the timeline would be nice. No but the dispute statement I was confused on what all to add.

● We want to know your thoughts on how easy or difficult the experience you reviewed is. When you answer this question, think about how easily you would find information you are most interested in

● On a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being not easy at all, and 5 being very easy, how easy were the pages you reviewed? I would say a 3 because what to include with an example. Easy of use would be a 5.

● Why did you rate it a (rating)?

## **Digital Dispute Intro page**

● What are your thoughts on this page? You can go to manage your debt and you can break it down on information, healthcare copays and basically it is numbers, information you need. It aligns with what I expected.

● Different from last one: it was an action item page and direct on what to do. This one is an overview for the options you have and provide numbers/links. Thats the different.

● Questions: I think for me I like that each section has a link that correlates with that information. No questions here unless I need to know more about a topic.

●

● Is anything unclear?

● Do you have any concerns after reading this paragraph?

### **Prompt**

● Which one would you select and why? Manage va debt and thinking about GI bill benefits health care co pays and that’s pretty much it.

● Gray boxes: the dispute your debt, request payment plan more or less than 5 years. Then you could get the links from the sections once I click on the plus signs.

● Did you know these ways: yes but not in this much details I just knew about the waiver option or compromise. Not the 5 or less than 5 years. In general I knew the repayment plan, this is specific.

● Difference in sections: it more so leads into the appeal/ dispute aspect for the payment in overall but the waiver would be requested for financial issues. If you are denied then you would appeal the wavier request for the debt itself. Whereas the over is the overpayment and dispute process.

[Reason for dispute page - entry field]

● What type of information would you include in this section?

[ Review and submit page]

● Do they expand the accordion? Theres an explanation then a link t learn more about the process. Then this one breaks down as to why I want to appeal the waiver. It breaks it down two ways you can do it then you can do a board appeal. That’s what I would do and a judge would review the case then there’s a link to learn more why a claim  could be contested.

● Feel about content: it is important because there’s different types of appeals and the breakdown/process is very important.

● Amount of content in different gray sections: yeah I like that there’s the direct link under each subsection . The information is great to the point its not daunting and I really appreciate the direct links for more information from those sources.

● Page as a whole:  It is the right amount of content and I can look what’s there then just jump to that sections so it doesn’t feel like it’s a lot of information. I can go directly to where I want to go.

● Firs overpayment , feelings on this page: I feel comfortable because I look at  the options and it is direct and takes me where I need to go. It feels less daunting it can be that way during the process so I like that this doesn’t feel that way.

● Any concerns on this page?

### **DIGITAL DISPUTE MENTAL MODELS**

● Now that you've gone through this form, I'd like to take some time to reflect and hear about how your experience was today. Please only comment on your experience with the form.

● How did you feel while completing this form? Were there any moments where you felt frustrated or overwhelmed? If so, why?

● Do you feel confident about what actions you need to take next?

● Did you know this option to resolve your debt existed?

● Have you encountered something similar to this process before?

● How does this compare?

● What did you expect to see on this form that wasn’t there if anything? Was anything missing?

● When you answer this next question, think about how easily you would be able to fill out this form

● On a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being not easy at all, and 5 being very easy, how easy to understand fill out was this form?

● Why did you rate it a (rating)?

## **Whole Experience Post Task Questions (5 minutes)**

● Now thinking about the experience from start to finish, how was your experience? Was anything difficult? Was anything easy? No the only time was not having the blueprint of what to include in the statement, it would’ve been helpful but other than that no.

● Finding information, how easy is it: A 5.

● What would you change if anything? What can be improved? Was anything unclear?

Learn more about choosing an option: So it breaks down how to go through the process and lists how to make the decision and what kind you will file. If there’s new evidence it is a supplemental claim. If you think there’s an error then its higher review with no new evidence. For the board appeal, if there’s an error and it have new evidence or no new evidence it is direct. Listing an example might be helpful to know which route. Board review is the top tier option to select so knowing when the right time to go that route. You could argue that you don’t want to go to a process and just go to the top. It would be nice to know when to just go to the first option

Detail in page: I think it’s good, knowing and it is directly. It is very direct and doesn’t need to say much.

Those are all the questions that I had for you today.

## **Permission to use clips with internal VA partners**

● Circling back about the optional use of clips with internal VA partners. Now that you know what we’ve discussed, are you still comfortable with this? Yes

● Do you have any questions for me or is there anything else that you think that I should know? No.

Question about first debt, process to dispute, how long did it take to resolve: I want to say it was 4 months or something like that.

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it works well for all Veterans.

**[End of session]**

## **Emergency Exit**

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so it’s easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
