## **Getting to know you (10 minutes)**

Hello/Welcome

Thank you so much for your time today. My name is Charlotte and I work at VA.gov - it’s nice to meet you!

How are you today?

I work at VA.gov to help improve access to benefits and services for Veterans like you. This work is meaningful to me because I believe that those who have served have a right to these services. [meaning]

You’ll notice there are a few people on the call already. They’re my colleagues and they’re here to listen and to learn. Is that ok with you? [permission]

My goal today is to learn how easy or difficult it is to use a digital portal we are working on to help you understand how to resolve and resolve VA overpayment debts.

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

Next, I want to explain my role better.

I am a consultant for the VA and my role is to talk to Veterans like you to understand the challenges you face in the space of VA medical copay billing. I am gathering information to help improve the experience of managing or resolving your VA copay bills.

The limits of my role are that I am not the final decision maker on the experience nor am I a financial expert, but I can surface issues and challenges that come up in research to the VA.

Your comfort and well-being are very important to us.

Sensitive topics might come up, and if at any point you want to take a break, please let me know. If you want or need to stop the interview at any point, just let me know. [comfort and consent]

Your identity will be kept confidential, and any information we take away from the interview will be stored securely. [confidentiality]

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more. Yeah no problem.

_Optional_:

One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like you’re on-screen image.

[Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA.]

At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.

Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences? Yeah that’s fine.

Do you have any questions for me? Um No.

I want to make sure the next 60 minutes are still good for you today? Yes.  
  

### **START INTERVIEW**

## **Warm-up**  
[Rapport building]

● We like to start off with a lighthearted question to get to know you better.

● What’s something you enjoy doing these days—any hobbies or routines? OR What's your favorite thing about Spring? Woodworking. 

● Thank you for sharing! (personal response)

### **Baseline [5 minutes]**

● Can you briefly tell me what your most recent experience with VA overpayment debt has been and when it appeared? [establish baseline] Okay so um my most recent one was I got divorced and my ex-wife was still on my disability payment. I totally thought the VA would automatically take her off. I didn’t know I had to call in for them to take her off. I got divorced in 2017 and it went all the way to 2020. I had a huge debt 250 a month and it accumulated. When I got remarried I tried to add my new wife and they said it showed that I was married. I ended up having to pay all of that back.

● How did you find out: So after I changed the information in the system it was the system that’s in now, it was in eBenefits. I changed dependents, I had to remove and add a new one. A week or two later in the mail I got the notice. I want to say I was like wow that’s a lot of money. I think it was like 3800 dollars. It was quite a bit. I was surprised and my wife was to so we had to budget for.

● Feelings: Pretty bad because it is an overwhelming amount if you aren’t ready for it. I live in [location omitted] so everything is so expensive and having to pay that on top its pretty rough. I called and asked if I could make payments and they ask how much you can pay. I want to say I paid 130-150 a month and they would take it out of my monthly payment.

● Added on eBenefits: Maybe it was on va.gov, when did it change. You still had to go on there. I just now finished paying it off about 9 months ago. You still had to go on va.gov to pay but when I first started it was on eBenefits. You used to have a password and you had to change it to a new system instead of DS logon. The payment plan was setup on the phone but to check the balance you had to go online to review it because they wouldn’t tell you on the phone. The online portal was a good experience; it is better than the old system. It is streamline and easy to understand. Before I couldn’t but with va.gov it is a lot easier.

● What, if any, actions have you taken to understand or resolve this debt?

● In 1-3 words, what words would you use to describe the process of understanding and resolving your debt in your experience so far? It was positive, it wasn’t to hard. Well like I said being able to see the progress was very positive because you see yeah I have this much left to pay and they have been taking this amount. It is easy to understand what is being taken out and how much is left. The person that I called was positive and the website was very streamline and very nice. It was easy.

## **Warm-up Questions - (3-5 minutes)**

Before we look at the design prototype, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

● What device are you using today? mobile

● Does the device you're using have a screen to share?

● What type of screenreader or other assistive technology are you using? (Voiceover? Something else?)

● How comfortable are you using your screenreader, how long have you been using it?

### **Prototype (5 minutes)**

Let’s go to the next part of the interview where we are going to share a digital experience we’re working on and ask for your feedback. A few things I want you to know:

You'll be interacting with a prototype that may not work exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. This is very important to know: since it's a demo, we have used fake information, and none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. In this task, we would like to hear your honest feedback. Please comment on what is clear and unclear.

I am going to drop a link in the Zoom chat. When you receive the link, please open the page. Send direct link to Debt Portal prototype Link: ([https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt](https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt)) [Mobile sessions screen share directions] [Sharing screen instructions as needed]

### **Manage your VA debt for benefit overpayments and copay bills [**[**page**](https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt)**] [2-3 minutes]**

● Does this page look familiar to you? Yes. So when you come on to manage you can look at the benefit debt, make payment, request help and that’s where you ask if you need help with a payment. I think I used it once because my paycheck got messed up so I asked for a deference and they did it once for me. You can sign in and it shows you how much you owe and if you made any payments. This is easy. What you can do it tells you everything, last time I went in I read it all. You can make payments with that button then va.gov to repay it, it takes you right there when you do it.

● Pay.va.gov: no it was automatic for me. I pushed it anyway because my wife asked if I could make an extra payment that I  missed, I started it but I ended up not doing it because I didn’t want to mess it up. If you do something off what was established and then they owe you money it takes forever. I overpaid once and it took 4 months to get it back. They are like the IRS, if you owe them money they take it right away but if they owe you month it takes a while.

● New information here: A waiver part, I didn’t know you could ask for a waiver. I didn’t know they granted waivers; I thought they just gave a payment plan. Yeah all of this is what I have seen I want to say. I don’t remember this part if you have questions because at first I didn’t know who to call, I don’t remember it but I could be mistaken.

● How did you find the number: I had to ask someone. I had a friend that had the same issue and they told me to google it. Then I remember on the paper they sent me it was there but I couldn’t remember where I put it. It took me a little while to figure it out. I put VA debt pay number to find it on google.

● Stands out: need help makes it a lot easier. And you can click that and it’ll call. I might have overlooked this last time. You can dispute copays and overpayments. Yeah if you can do the dispute right there that’s good. That’s more helpful than waiting 30 minutes on the phone for someone. That’s a lot easier then just wait for a response. I guess when you are in the moment you don’t scroll to look for stuff. Now it pops out really easy. It might be because I am not stressed out about it. It looks simple and easy, you don’t need to ask a question because everything you need to know is right there.

● Would you look at it differently if stressed: yeah I would be looking for something to stand out to me and I would be scrolling to find stuff. Maybe now looking at it, it looks pretty easy even if I were stressed.

● Given your current or recent situation, what are you most interested in on this page? [Mental Models]

● Take a moment to show me where on the page you would go to get help with your debt [task]

● I’d like to bring you attention to the ‘Request Financial Help section. [comprehension]

● What are your thoughts about this page? Any information missing that you’d like to see? Well so if you request a wavier or compromise offer I am guessing the compromise offer is for them to lower the amount because it is a high amount and you can fill out the va form 5655 online. If I push that request button what happens.

● Did you expect this: This is if you need to pay more than 5 years or need a comprise offer. Okay. Can I see the actual request. The only reason I ask is because I wonder how easy it was to fill out. As far as everything else I am glad they tell you what you need on the top if you scroll up. Right here they tell you to check and see if it’s the right form. I guess this is someone that has a lot of money owed or just cannot afford it. It tells you what they ask for, I wanted to see it to see if it was easy. It is straightforward and tells you up front if you don’t need more than 5 years than this isn’t for you.

● Where on this page would you click on if you wanted help with your debt? Can you point out which links, specifically?

● Before you click, what do you understand to be the difference between the first link <[Request help with overpayments and copay bills online](https://zyc78g.csb.app/request-help)> and the second <[Learn about other ways to request help with VA debt](https://zyc78g.csb.app/help-options)> [Mental Models] I guess the second part is if you aren’t looking to do a waiver or request overpayment help there are other ways the VA could help you. I assume when you click on it there are other resources.

● Which link would you most interested in clicking on first? Why?

● Please click on the link

## **Introductory pages and R&S page (orientation and wayfinding)**

● [Relate or make a connection to what they shared earlier in baseline section about experience resolving their debt]

● Please take some time to browse through this page. Please remember to think aloud

You can make a payment or review it request payment plan less than 5 years or more than 5 years. Is this it all in one area or other answers. When you click the less than 5 years repayment. Okay yeah. I see there’s a link there to do that. That’s good because if you have any questions you click the plus sign and then have the link to do what you want to do right there. That is really easy. Isn’t of trying to find it the answer is already there for you.

Difference between less or more than 5 years: less than 5 years is just calling and saying how much you can pay or it calculates it for you whereas the second one is a more extensive process because they need to know why you need more than 5 years to repay.

Appeals: One is appealing the reason for why you have the debt, then the second is for the decision for a waiver. If they give you a reason for the overpayment you can appeal it under the first one. That is pretty commonsense stuff.

● What stands out to you?

● What questions do you have after reviewing this page, if any?

● Which option would you say is relevant to your situation?

● Can you show me where you might look if you want to see if there is a process to let the VA know that you shouldn’t have this debt? [task: finding dispute section] Appeal the va decision that resulted in this overpayment. Dispute your overpayment, I didn’t see that at first. See how you have a year from when you got the letter. I didn’t see it at first because I was concentrated with the appeals but once I saw dispute I knew where I needed to go.

● Anything else stand out: So what are the stem scholarship and vet tec program.

● Unclear: I mean I guess if you had a stem scholarship and had a debt you would know what it is. It is specifically for those people that have them. If I had a debt with the Rogers Stem Scholarship, you really need to read down there where it says you need to contact them by email or mail. I wouldn’t see that if I was just scrolling. To me that would just be telling me about information for that scholarship, you don’t know it is for debt until you look really closely there.

● What if it had debt at the end: yeah.

● Top of the page, categories don’t say debt so tis unclear:” correct it says what’s on this page. Disability compensation but it doesn’t say anything about debt. It is more information.

● If unclear, give a bit more guidance [partial pass]

● Based on what it says here, what is important to know about disputing overpayment debt?

● What could happen after 30 days if you don't make any payments on your debt? [correct answer: could be sent to collections]

● Do you have any questions or concerns after reading this paragraph?

## **Dispute Form**

Before we move on to this next section, I have some questions about the pages you just reviewed.

This is not for copay debt. (reading page) That is important to know that you will need to continue to make payments while they are reviewing the dispute. If you don’t pay you could get extra fees.

Visible  enough: no I think it is really small. The average person will see the bold letters and wont scroll to see it. I see the bullet points but they don’t stick out much to me. I will see what to know before you fill out this form. If I am inquisitive  I might look for it but I could get there and then realize I cannot dispute it there. The one year is bold the 30 days is bold but I feel like it should have a bold subpoint like you know what to know before you fill out the form and the first one should be what you can dispute then have the sub points. Have the time limit and how long you have as a sub point. Another bullet point that says something to make you look down there.

## **‘Wizard’ Post Task Questions (5 minutes)**

● What was your overall experience with the pages you reviewed until this point? They have been good so far before this point it is self-explanatory and commonsense stuff. Theres a few things with the bullet points that mislead you but other than that it is pretty good. I like the dropdown for things you’d be looking for. That is good because you don’t need to figure out the area, it is just there and there’s the information for you.

● How did you feel while finding this form? Were there any moments where you felt frustrated or overwhelmed? If so, why?

● What would you change if anything? What can be improved? Was anything unclear?

● We want to know your thoughts on how easy or difficult the experience you reviewed is. When you answer this question, think about how easily you would find information you are most interested in

● On a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being not easy at all, and 5 being very easy, how easy were the pages you reviewed? I would say it would be a 5 but the other two types of debt make it a 4 because I wouldn’t know where it was. I would find it easily a 5 if I wasn’t interested in the scholarship debt.

● Why did you rate it a (rating)?

## **Digital Dispute Intro page**

● What are your thoughts on this page?

● Is anything unclear?

● Do you have any concerns after reading this paragraph?

### **Prompt**

● Please go ahead and go through this form, imagining you were filling this form out. I want to remind you that the information filled out in this demo is fake information.

● Please remember to talk aloud and point out anything that is unclear or confusing

● I’ll stop you if I have follow up questions  
[Reason for dispute page]

● Okay I can click one or both debts and if it’s not listed you can call to find out. That’s easy. Yeah you are disputing if you owe it or if the amount is wrong. That is pretty straightforward. If you can’t afford it there’s a dropdown but it should be bigger because most people would be looking for that. Maybe bigger and in bold so it sticks out in case they pass it over.

● Do any of these reasons apply to you? Which one would you select and why?  
[Reason for dispute page - entry field]

● What type of information would you include in this section? If it was for housing I guess it is the stipend while you are going through school and you owe it because you didn’t do full time but they paid it as you were in full time. For my case I would put why I think I don’t owe the debt and it would be based on the dates because I had already pout in the request and it took longer than 60 days to process. Just anything as to why I didn’t owe that much money.

● Review page: Yeah that’s fine it will tell me all of the information and to confirm if what I am saying is accurate.

● Confirmation page: when you print does it give the option to save it as PDF. If you use your mobile you can’t print, I just save it as a pdf and put it in my google box or the Microsoft drive. Most people that fill this out it will be on mobile not go sit at the computer.

[ Review and submit page]

● Do they expand the accordion?

● Any concerns on this page?

### **DIGITAL DISPUTE MENTAL MODELS**

● Now that you've gone through this form, I'd like to take some time to reflect and hear about how your experience was today. Please only comment on your experience with the form.

● How did you feel while completing this form? Were there any moments where you felt frustrated or overwhelmed? If so, why? I like it I honestly do. It is really easy I feel like its straightforward. Mostly anyone can understand this and what they are trying to do if they can read.

● Do you feel confident about what actions you need to take next? Um. I feel good because it tells you what to expect next, it stood out right away. Continue to make payments. Again maybe like on the other page it said you had the 1 year and 30 days in bold I would have continue to make payments would be in bold. Mail you a letter would be in bold as well.

● Did you know this option to resolve your debt existed?

● Have you encountered something similar to this process before?

● How does this compare?

● What did you expect to see on this form that wasn’t there if anything? Was anything missing?

● When you answer this next question, think about how easily you would be able to fill out this form

● On a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being not easy at all, and 5 being very easy, how easy to understand fill out was this form? 5

● Why did you rate it a (rating)?

## **Whole Experience Post Task Questions (5 minutes)**

● Now thinking about the experience from start to finish, how was your experience? Was anything difficult? Was anything easy? Um no other than what I statement. Most will want to fill this out where they are at because they get nervous and right away they want to get it done and save the information instead of taking a screenshot.

● What would you change if anything? What can be improved? Was anything unclear?

Those are all the questions that I had for you today.

## **Permission to use clips with internal VA partners**

● Circling back about the optional use of clips with internal VA partners. Now that you know what we’ve discussed, are you still comfortable with this? Yeah that’s fine.

● Do you have any questions for me or is there anything else that you think that I should know?

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it works well for all Veterans.

**[End of session]**

## **Emergency Exit**

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so it’s easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
