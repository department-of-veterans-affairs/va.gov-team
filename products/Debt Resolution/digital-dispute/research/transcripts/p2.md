### Verbatim notes taken by Perigean

# **Conversation Guide for Financial Management Team, R/S Page & Digital Dispute , May 2025**

## **Getting to know you (10 minutes)**

Hello/Welcome

Thank you so much for your time today. My name is Charlotte and I work at VA.gov - it’s nice to meet you!

How are you today?

I work at VA.gov to help improve access to benefits and services for Veterans like you. This work is meaningful to me because I believe that those who have served have a right to these services. [meaning]

You’ll notice there are a few people on the call already. They’re my colleagues and they’re here to listen and to learn. Is that ok with you? [permission]

My goal today is to learn how easy or difficult it is to use a digital portal we are working on to help you understand how to resolve and resolve VA overpayment debts.

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

Next, I want to explain my role better.

I am a consultant for the VA and my role is to talk to Veterans like you to understand the challenges you face in the space of VA medical copay billing. I am gathering information to help improve the experience of managing or resolving your VA copay bills.

The limits of my role are that I am not the final decision maker on the experience nor am I a financial expert, but I can surface issues and challenges that come up in research to the VA.

Your comfort and well-being are very important to us.

Sensitive topics might come up, and if at any point you want to take a break, please let me know. If you want or need to stop the interview at any point, just let me know. [comfort and consent]

Your identity will be kept confidential, and any information we take away from the interview will be stored securely. [confidentiality]

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more. Yes

_Optional_:

Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences? Okay. Yes

One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like you’re on-screen image.

[Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA.]

At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.

Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences? Yes

Do you have any questions for me? No

I want to make sure the next 60 minutes are still good for you today? Yes it’s good.

### **START INTERVIEW**

## **Warm-up**  
[Rapport building]

● We like to start off with a lighthearted question to get to know you better.

● What’s something you enjoy doing these days—any hobbies or routines? OR What's your favorite thing about Spring? Um I like reading and hiking. Yes, well I don’t live in parker highest but there’s a place called [omitted] which is awesome. It is a lot of hills and things like deer. I like took at the deer and they aren’t shy at all so it is enjoyable.

● Thank you for sharing! (personal response)

### **Baseline [5 minutes]**

● Can you briefly tell me what your most recent experience with VA overpayment debt has been and when it appeared? [establish baseline] 

Most recent experience, well when it appeared it was about 3 years ago and I guess my most recent experience was them taking the remaining amount of debt from back pay from a claim. I did not know that was going to happen. I often check the VA app for my claim and I saw one was finished and showed the amount then a few days later it was significantly lower than what I would receive. That’s when I went on va.gov to see if it was the debt, the debt wasn’t there anymore so I didn’t need to call to know the difference in payment.

● What, if any, actions have you taken to understand or resolve this debt? 

I just let it be because I didn’t think there was anything else I could do; they were taking it monthly and I thought that would still happen. It would’ve been nice to have that option. Previous plan with va, I am not sure what the process was called. When they started taking the debt they sent me a letter telling me that they were going to do that. They said that would be the repayment. No form was required to be filled out before.

● In 1-3 words, what words would you use to describe the process of understanding and resolving your debt in your experience so far? 

Um very frustrating.

## **Warm-up Questions - (3-5 minutes)**

Before we look at the design prototype, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

● What device are you using today? Laptop

● Does the device you're using have a screen to share?

● What type of screenreader or other assistive technology are you using? (Voiceover? Something else?)

● How comfortable are you using your screenreader, how long have you been using it?

### **Prototype (5 minutes)**

Let’s go to the next part of the interview where we are going to share a digital experience we’re working on and ask for your feedback. A few things I want you to know:

You'll be interacting with a prototype that may not work exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. This is very important to know: since it's a demo, we have used fake information, and none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. In this task, we would like to hear your honest feedback. Please comment on what is clear and unclear.

I am going to drop a link in the Zoom chat. When you receive the link, please open the page. Send direct link to Debt Portal prototype Link: ([https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt](https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt)) [Mobile sessions screen share directions] [Sharing screen instructions as needed]

### **Manage your VA debt for benefit overpayments and copay bills [**[**page**](https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt)**] [2-3 minutes]**

● Does this page look familiar to you? Yes.

● Given your current or recent situation, what are you most interested in on this page? [Mental Models] I would say Um probably request financial help. That and well I know you said one but the make a payment online. I don’t know if that’s an option now but I think that’s great. When you have extra money you can pay. I did not know they were an option before. I think I asked about financial help but I thought they told me it had to be in a certain amount of time; I was too far into the debt. It had been 2 years.

● Anything that stand out: Not really.

● Take a moment to show me where on the page you would go to get help with your debt [task]

● I’d like to bring you attention to the ‘Request Financial Help section. [comprehension]

● What are your thoughts about this page? Any information missing that you’d like to see? I like the different options. I like that you can request help with overpayments. Okay yeah I see the time limit has been changed. It is a year within the received debt. Theres other ways to request help as well.

● Where on this page would you click on if you wanted help with your debt? Can you point out which links, specifically?

● Before you click, what do you understand to be the difference between the first link <[Request help with overpayments and copay bills online](https://zyc78g.csb.app/request-help)> and the second <[Learn about other ways to request help with VA debt](https://zyc78g.csb.app/help-options)> [Mental Models] I assume the first like is if you are before that year then the other link would be if you are outside of that year.

● Which link would you most interested in clicking on first? Why? Well knowing how it was over a year I would click learn about other ways.

● Please click on the link

## **Introductory pages and R&S page (orientation and wayfinding)**

● [Relate or make a connection to what they shared earlier in baseline section about experience resolving their debt]

● Please take some time to browse through this page. Please remember to think aloud

● What stands out to you? I like that they give the option to request a repayment plan less than 5 years or more than 5 years. Unless I didn’t know it I don’t think I had an option. If I wanted to learn more about something in gray I would click on it. Can I click on it. It seems like everything has a 1-year limit. Um I mean a year is a long time but also I feel like there can be things missed in a year. The fact that you can only ask for help within 1 year, that I don’t think I like because peoples financial situations change. If they lose their job and then need help it isn’t an option for a waiver. A lot can change in a year.

● 1 year, reference to from what: A year after you received the letter that you have a debt that needs to be repaid. I remember the letter, yeah.

● What questions do you have after reviewing this page, if any?

● Which option would you say is relevant to your situation?

● Can you show me where you might look if you want to see if there is a process to let the VA know that you shouldn’t have this debt? [task: finding dispute section] It would be dispute your overpayment.

● If unclear, give a bit more guidance [partial pass]

● Based on what it says here, what is important to know about disputing overpayment debt? You only have within 1 year to dispute it form the letter, if it is done within 30 days you avoid it being sent to collections. 30 days before they start taking money back, if you dispute it before then you don’t need to worry about money being taken from your check.

● Do you have any questions or concerns after reading this paragraph? I don’t believe so.  I know putting anything in at the va like claims, paperwork, it takes a lot time to get completed so in the meantime I feel like if it is in before 30 days you will still get money taken out because the VA wont get it done within 30 days. Any claim I have put in or paperwork for anything to be done takes months to years in the VA. It seems like they would still take money then make a decision and if its in your favor the money would be given back but payments would still be taken. It says you still need to make payments while they review. I have never disputed a claim before but anything that has to deal with compensation or education payments have always taken longer than 30 days.

● Questions: I wonder what the debt relief is in comparison to the payment plan. I believe I heard about it during covid they stopped payments. Well debt relief sounds like it would be, I am not even sure it could mean a few things. Like get rid of the debt or lower the debt. Probably one of those.

● How do you feel about the term wavier: It sounds like be where they wave it like you no longer owe the debt. Yeah I guess that’s when you dispute it and appeal it if they said no you still owe the debt. Appeal it just like claims.

● Clear based on these titles: I wouldn’t say it is clear. You would have to click on it and hope it explains it or assume that’s what it means or call. That doesn’t say much at all. The second one gives a lot more information. Yeah I like the information it is giving it doesn’t leave you to assume. It looks like it tells you the exact process to go through in order to appeal. The second section is better, the less you have to call the VA to ask questions the better.

## **Dispute Form**

Before we move on to this next section, I have some questions about the pages you just reviewed.

## **‘Wizard’ Post Task Questions (5 minutes)**

● What was your overall experience with the pages you reviewed until this point? I like them before the lack of some information. They were easy to navigate and it was laid out for you, which was helpful. It would be good for the older veterans that aren’t tech savvy. It would be way for anyone to find what they are looking for.

● How did you feel while finding this form? Were there any moments where you felt frustrated or overwhelmed? If so, why? No it was easy to find.

● What would you change if anything? What can be improved? Was anything unclear? Um, well for the most part I think it is good just other than some of the areas not having a lot of information and also this request payment plan/debt relieve. It would be nice to submit it online and not have to download and mail it in. the older vets probably don’t mind because they have stamps and stuff but it seems like it would be easier/quicker to submit it online.

● We want to know your thoughts on how easy or difficult the experience you reviewed is. When you answer this question, think about how easily you would find information you are most interested in

● On a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being not easy at all, and 5 being very easy, how easy were the pages you reviewed? I would say 5, well everything is laid out for you and then there’s the when you open the plus sign it gives you the information and gives you the links to get further information for what you need. You don’t have to figure it out or find it in another areas

● Did you know the plus signs right away: I knew to do it, I like that you don’t have to click directly on the plus, I have clicked on the letters before and then you have to click right on the plus sign. Just clicking anywhere will expand it which is intuitive.

● Why did you rate it a (rating)?

## **Digital Dispute Intro page**

● What are your thoughts on this page? I think it a good amount of information. Theres the start your dispute and you don’t need to go to another section. Years ago there was a section for information then a section for forms which was frustrating. I like this though.

● Is anything unclear?

● Do you have any concerns after reading this paragraph? No.

### **Prompt**

● Please go ahead and go through this form, imagining you were filling this form out. I want to remind you that the information filled out in this demo is fake information.

● Please remember to talk aloud and point out anything that is unclear or confusing

● I’ll stop you if I have follow up questions  
[Reason for dispute page]

● Do any of these reasons apply to you? Which one would you select and why? No, do I just click on.  
[Reason for dispute page - entry field]I like how it has the phone number incase your personal information isn’t correct. I  don’t know if it was that information, it wasn’t my name or SS but the VA had my deployment status wrong. After all these years I didn’t know that but I corrected it a few months ago and I had to call serval numbers for that. I like that you can correct it here and not call. I like this a lot, it lists the debts individually and you can dispute them individually. It gives you the date you until you can request help which is helpful. Some people may not remember when they got the letter, I file everything but most people don’t so they might not know. I am not sure how partially the va is but I could imagine if you are over a few days over requesting help it would be extremely frustrating. I like the numbers here as well.

● What type of information would you include in this section? Well if this happened and I didn’t think I owed it. I am trying to figure out why or how this may have happened. I would let them know the dates I was in school and paid. I would let them know I was still in school during those times.

[ Review and submit page]

● Do they expand the accordion?

● Thoughts: I like the page because you have a second chance to confirm all of your information and choices are correct as well as the statements before you actually submit it.

● What next: type my name and certify check mark the information and submit.

● Confirmation page: it is nice that they are letting you know they will contact you once you receive the form. Okay.

● Confident what will happen next: Yes I do because they let you know it will take up to 5 days and they will contact you so that’s great. You will know after 5 days if they haven’t contacted you that they didn’t receive it. Once I submitted a claim and 6 months after I called and they told me they didn’t receive it. They are letting you know after 5 days, you’ll know if we received it. If you don’t get an email or letter you can call to see what to do if you need to resubmit it. I would go back to va.gov to see if it says it was submitted before I called and asked. That way I could reassure them it was submitted but I haven’t received any correspondence letting me know.

● Any concerns on this page?

### **DIGITAL DISPUTE MENTAL MODELS**

● Now that you've gone through this form, I'd like to take some time to reflect and hear about how your experience was today. Please only comment on your experience with the form.

● How did you feel while completing this form? Were there any moments where you felt frustrated or overwhelmed? If so, why? Good, it was easy and direct. Right to the point, easy to understand and no one would be confused.

● Do you feel confident about what actions you need to take next?

● Did you know this option to resolve your debt existed? No I did not.

● Have you encountered something similar to this process before?

● How does this compare?

● What did you expect to see on this form that wasn’t there if anything? Was anything missing?

● When you answer this next question, think about how easily you would be able to fill out this form

● On a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being not easy at all, and 5 being very easy, how easy to understand fill out was this form? I would say 5. Everything is easy to understand and self-explanatory. They gave clear instructions on what you needed to do.

● Why did you rate it a (rating)?

## **Whole Experience Post Task Questions (5 minutes)**

● Now thinking about the experience from start to finish, how was your experience? Was anything difficult? Was anything easy? My experience was good and I would consider it very easy. Easy to find and understand.

● What would you change if anything? What can be improved? Was anything unclear? Just the small bit of more information for some of the options. Learn more information about how to get help with debt page.

Those are all the questions that I had for you today.

## **Permission to use clips with internal VA partners**

● Circling back about the optional use of clips with internal VA partners. Now that you know what we’ve discussed, are you still comfortable with this? Yes

● Do you have any questions for me or is there anything else that you think that I should know? Not that I can think of.

● We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it works well for all Veterans.

**[End of session]**

## **Emergency Exit**

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so it’s easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
