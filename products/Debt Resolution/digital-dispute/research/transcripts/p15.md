## **Getting to know you (10 minutes)**

Hello/Welcome

Thank you so much for your time today. My name is Charlotte and I work at VA.gov - it’s nice to meet you!

How are you today?

I work at VA.gov to help improve access to benefits and services for Veterans like you. This work is meaningful to me because I believe that those who have served have a right to these services. [meaning]

You’ll notice there are a few people on the call already. They’re my colleagues and they’re here to listen and to learn. Is that ok with you? [permission]

My goal today is to learn how easy or difficult it is to use a digital portal we are working on to help you understand how to resolve and resolve VA overpayment debts.

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

Next, I want to explain my role better.

I am a consultant for the VA and my role is to talk to Veterans like you to understand the challenges you face in the space of VA medical copay billing. I am gathering information to help improve the experience of managing or resolving your VA copay bills.

The limits of my role are that I am not the final decision maker on the experience nor am I a financial expert, but I can surface issues and challenges that come up in research to the VA.

Your comfort and well-being are very important to us.

Sensitive topics might come up, and if at any point you want to take a break, please let me know. If you want or need to stop the interview at any point, just let me know. [comfort and consent]

Your identity will be kept confidential, and any information we take away from the interview will be stored securely. [confidentiality]

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more. I am, yeah.

_Optional_:

One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like you’re on-screen image.

[Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA.]

At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.

Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences? Yes.

Do you have any questions for me? No.

I want to make sure the next 60 minutes are still good for you today? Yes.  
  

### **START INTERVIEW**

## **Warm-up**  
[Rapport building]

● We like to start off with a lighthearted question to get to know you better.

● What’s something you enjoy doing these days—any hobbies or routines? OR What's your favorite thing about Spring? Cycling, photography, I drink a lot of coffee, hiking. 

● Thank you for sharing! (personal response)

### **Baseline [5 minutes]**

● Can you briefly tell me what your most recent experience with VA overpayment debt has been and when it appeared? [establish baseline] I was married and my ex had a 50 percent disability; we got divorced and had a joint account. I was liable and honestly  I don’t know I think it is resolved. I dealt with so much paperwork, still get letters. Not from the va but I think it is resolved. No additional letters from the VA. I didn’t report it immediately, its on me. We had a joint account and it’s not something I thought of. Theres a lot of things during a divorce, its one of those things I didn’t want to deal with. I wasn’t responsible I lost a house with the VA loan. VA sent a letter about overpayment. I am not sure I remember the repayment options; I did work something out.

● Feelings on letter: It was totally fair; I didn’t think about it. It was additional income and it was something I didn’t really pay attention to.

● What, if any, actions have you taken to understand or resolve this debt?

● In 1-3 words, what words would you use to describe the process of understanding and resolving your debt in your experience so far? Straightforward, I dealt with repayment options with the state, the IRS for not filing on time. Thankfully, there are payment options. It has been resolved.

● Communication methods: Email, I didn’t have to talk to anyone. Had to sign into va.gov. It was a payment plan that was already setup for me so I just signed up.

## **Warm-up Questions - (3-5 minutes)**

Before we look at the design prototype, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

● What device are you using today?

● Does the device you're using have a screen to share?

● What type of screenreader or other assistive technology are you using? (Voiceover? Something else?)

● How comfortable are you using your screenreader, how long have you been using it?

### **Prototype (5 minutes)**

Let’s go to the next part of the interview where we are going to share a digital experience we’re working on and ask for your feedback. A few things I want you to know:

You'll be interacting with a prototype that may not work exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. This is very important to know: since it's a demo, we have used fake information, and none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. In this task, we would like to hear your honest feedback. Please comment on what is clear and unclear.

I am going to drop a link in the Zoom chat. When you receive the link, please open the page. Send direct link to Debt Portal prototype Link: ([https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt](https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt)) [Mobile sessions screen share directions] [Sharing screen instructions as needed]

### **Manage your VA debt for benefit overpayments and copay bills [**[**page**](https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt)**] [2-3 minutes]**

● Does this page look familiar to you? I looks similar, I don’t really remember. The VA.gov site is very basic. No frills. The government side isn’t for frills. Okay this part look familiar, the sign in does anyway. Make a payment now looks familiar. Oh request help, I don’t remember that. I don’t remember that options, I was employed so I think I wasn’t I would’ve applied for that. I didn’t even think to look at the links for assistance. This looks similar to everything I have used va.gov.

● Know about the options: no but it makes sense. If I was unemployed I would have looked at that.

● Given your current or recent situation, what are you most interested in on this page? [Mental Models]

● Take a moment to show me where on the page you would go to get help with your debt [task]

● I’d like to bring you attention to the ‘Request Financial Help section. [comprehension]

● What are your thoughts about this page? Any information missing that you’d like to see? Maybe a FAQ on the payment options. How long you can stretch out a payment schedule. That kinda thing.

● Where on this page would you click on if you wanted help with your debt? Can you point out which links, specifically?

● Before you click, what do you understand to be the difference between the first link <[Request help with overpayments and copay bills online](https://zyc78g.csb.app/request-help)> and the second <[Learn about other ways to request help with VA debt](https://zyc78g.csb.app/help-options)> [Mental Models]. A financial report makes sense to me if you have income , I have a mortgage loan that makes you stall payments. Other options to request help, maybe the other options would be to put a pause on it while it is appealed. Oh wavier, I didn’t know what would qualify you. Maybe an injunction or stop while you appeal. I would think it would be an appeal, which would be the second option.

● Which link would you most interested in clicking on first? Why? Overpayment/co pay bills. Lets see what this is. Wow more than 5 years, that’s a long time. Work history, monthly income, okay. Wow this looks complicated. It is a lot of compile especially if you have joint expenses.

● This what you expected: Yeah. This is what I expected because when you need help they will want a complete overview. This is why I don’t really like requesting additional help, it is very time consuming. I am always missing a document and asked about follow up questions.

● Please click on the link

## **Introductory pages and R&S page (orientation and wayfinding)**

● [Relate or make a connection to what they shared earlier in baseline section about experience resolving their debt]

● Please take some time to browse through this page. Please remember to think aloud

● What stands out to you? : You shouldn’t need more than 5 years to pay off a debt. That is pretty bad if you have to pay over 5 years.

● Difference between links: I think it just the 5 years. Oh you can appeal the actual decision and you can use the repayment plan over 5 years. That seems like the similar reason to click on the second option.

The waiver, I don’t know how you get a waiver. You can appeal the decision.

Difference in appeals: So there are two options, appeal waiver and then appeal the decision itself. I am a bit confused. I am not sure what a waiver request is, like waive the entire debt. It could be a doctor if it’s a medical issue like you need to see a different doctor, or the divorce wasn’t final until a certain date and you have joint accounts. It gets complicated during a divorce and could use that as an excuse but I would still need to pay it. The board appeal is an options, it gives the explanation of the process. Wow two board appeals, holy cow. It is similar to applying for a disability, you can appeal it.

● What questions do you have after reviewing this page, if any?

● Which option would you say is relevant to your situation?

● Can you show me where you might look if you want to see if there is a process to let the VA know that you shouldn’t have this debt? [task: finding dispute section] I would think it would be the waiver. I would be contesting the debt. I would click dispute. Fill out a form.

● Thoughts: click start dispute, simple.

● If unclear, give a bit more guidance [partial pass]

● Based on what it says here, what is important to know about disputing overpayment debt?

● What could happen after 30 days if you don't make any payments on your debt? [correct answer: could be sent to collections]

● Do you have any questions or concerns after reading this paragraph?

## **Dispute Form**

Before we move on to this next section, I have some questions about the pages you just reviewed.

This is exactly what I thought it would be basic information. Alright.

Options apply: no.

I am contesting everything. (reading page) Why would I get an overpayment for this. I don’t know how I would or why the VA would feel like I was overpaid for the GI bill. I would include that I was unaware that this overpayment was taking affect and thought it would take affect later. I would provide a reason. I still have a disability so I could show the doctor letters, my pension was establish on this date here’s the contract. That kind of stuff, proof/evidence. That kinda thing. Wow this is super quick isn’t it. It’s a quick process.

Thoughts on this page: I would get an email and contacted back. They have an 1800 number. It would be nice to have an email,. I would never call that number. If I call you are on hold forever so I would rather avoid phone calls if possible.

## **‘Wizard’ Post Task Questions (5 minutes)**

● What was your overall experience with the pages you reviewed until this point? Easy, 4. Well I could make a written statement. The thing is you know you might not think much but what you type there is very important. It is easy to breeze through it and not add all of the details. I think it might be a bit to easy. Once you click submit you cant edit it. I wish you could edit it within 24 hours after submitting because I don’t know what I typed. It might be emailed to me. I tend to rush through so I would want to know what I typed.

● Thoughts on review page: Where is the edit option though. It would be helpful to edit from this page. Edit/save. That’s about it, I want to be able to edit like social media post. It is nice how you can go back, maybe it is in sandbox.

● How did you feel while finding this form? Were there any moments where you felt frustrated or overwhelmed? If so, why? I felt like I would have been able to upload documents. I am surprised I didn’t have the option. This looks very basic like the disability claim but you can upload documents. It is simple, straightforward. I will get an email confirmation; they will get back to me. It is a pretty straight forward process.

● Confidence: I would need to come up with forms and documents, I am reasonably confident I could come up with what they requested.

● Expectations of next steps: a decision or hearing like a phone/virtual hearing. Notification of a board meeting to review my case on this date and for me to be available to testify or make a written statement or come into the va.

● Anything here that tells you: Oh yeah right there, 5 days. I didn’t even read that. It doesn’t stand out,. I only cared about what’s next. I think I read this part but didn’t read up to 5 days, that seems pretty quick. I would just expect an email I know it takes time for it to run its course.

● What would you change if anything? What can be improved? Was anything unclear?

● We want to know your thoughts on how easy or difficult the experience you reviewed is. When you answer this question, think about how easily you would find information you are most interested in: simple, easy. I would upload documents and write a statement. I was unemployed and it was a hardship on me.

● On a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being not easy at all, and 5 being very easy, how easy were the pages you reviewed? Oh easy, 4 because nothing is perfect. Uploading documents that it, I was surprised about how quick the process is. I am done and already submitted it.

● Why did you rate it a (rating)?

Other options to request help page, thoughts on information: This is a lot. I am a bit overwhelmed already. Some of it doesn’t apply, I have no clue what Vet Tech is. Attorney fees make a phone call, could you tell me a bit more.

Is the title clear: It is clear but for attorney fees it says just make a phone call. Am I just supposed to know what Vet Tech is. STEM scholarship, I guess if you had one. Oh if you cant pay future copays, this is really good and this gives you a lot of options. Request a payment plan, download form. You have to pail it, that’s kinda a pain but I could do it. Appeal benefits. Oh I lost it. Yeah it is nice to see so many options.

On a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being not easy at all, and 5 being very easy, how easy was the options page you reviewed? I would say a 4, it is pretty good. Its not perfect but its pretty good. More details with attorney fees, I dealt with that myself so it’s a lot of money.
