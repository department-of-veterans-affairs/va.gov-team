## **Getting to know you (10 minutes)**

Hello/Welcome

Thank you so much for your time today. My name is Charlotte and I work at VA.gov - it’s nice to meet you!

How are you today?

I work at VA.gov to help improve access to benefits and services for Veterans like you. This work is meaningful to me because I believe that those who have served have a right to these services. [meaning]

You’ll notice there are a few people on the call already. They’re my colleagues and they’re here to listen and to learn. Is that ok with you? [permission]

My goal today is to learn how easy or difficult it is to use a digital portal we are working on to help you understand how to resolve and resolve VA overpayment debts.

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

Next, I want to explain my role better.

I am a consultant for the VA and my role is to talk to Veterans like you to understand the challenges you face in the space of VA medical copay billing. I am gathering information to help improve the experience of managing or resolving your VA copay bills.

The limits of my role are that I am not the final decision maker on the experience nor am I a financial expert, but I can surface issues and challenges that come up in research to the VA.

Your comfort and well-being are very important to us.

Sensitive topics might come up, and if at any point you want to take a break, please let me know. If you want or need to stop the interview at any point, just let me know. [comfort and consent]

Your identity will be kept confidential, and any information we take away from the interview will be stored securely. [confidentiality]

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? No

We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.

_Optional_:

One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like you’re on-screen image.

[Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA.]

At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.

Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?

Do you have any questions for me? No

I want to make sure the next 60 minutes are still good for you today? Yes  
  

### **START INTERVIEW**

## **Warm-up**  
[Rapport building]

● We like to start off with a lighthearted question to get to know you better.

● What’s something you enjoy doing these days—any hobbies or routines? OR What's your favorite thing about Spring? I enjoy gardening, I am repotting plants and getting ready for the summer here. I plant a lot of vegetables and herbs. I have a patio so I am limited so I have a lot of house plants that I put out.

● Thank you for sharing! (personal response)

### **Baseline [5 minutes]**

● Can you briefly tell me what your most recent experience with VA overpayment debt has been and when it appeared? [establish baseline] 

I received a letter every now and then, I don’t know where it  comes from. The main VA is in Annapolis; I think it comes out of Milwaukee. It is very convoluted. You don’t know where it  comes from but I get a letter about overpayments but I just always call in. They have a benefits section that you can go to and they are open during the day without an appointment. I am 90 minutes away and don’t drive on the highway. I prefer face-to-face because it is nearly impossible tog et them on the phone. You get voicemails and transferred. When I have an appointment there I sit down and talk to them, I have called and get someone on the phone but on hold for 15-20 minutes. I don’t know where they are. I find when I go to the office to see someone face to face it is very helpful.

● Feeling: I open them up, I dealt with the va for a long time so I don’t get upset about a bill. I look at it and read it and know I have to talk to someone about it. I get it every now and then so its not a big deal. Theres a date you have to pay it by and if you don’t there’s a fee. The letter it says it will go to collection and on your credit report. Its good to talk to someone as soon as possible so it gets worked on.

● Expect or surprise: It is always a surprise to me because I don’t expect a bill. After I go through the financial things with them I don’t even know which department, they will take the bill off. Eliminate the bill, wavier for the bill yeah. I have to talk to someone and fill out information. It’s a medical bill for prescriptions. Sometimes its an accident. Community care send a notice for what is sent to the provider and says the provider charge x amount and we pay this about and the veteran doesn’t owe anything but once I got a bill saying I owed 100. Before I  could call I got something that said there was in issue in the system and I didn’t actually owe money.

● What, if any, actions have you taken to understand or resolve this debt?

● In 1-3 words, what words would you use to describe the process of understanding and resolving your debt in your experience so far? 

I have to talk to someone so communication and that means me calling. I used to get them on the phone but the last few years it goes straight to voicemail.

## **Warm-up Questions - (3-5 minutes)**

Before we look at the design prototype, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

● What device are you using today?

● Does the device you're using have a screen to share?

● What type of screenreader or other assistive technology are you using? (Voiceover? Something else?)

● How comfortable are you using your screenreader, how long have you been using it?

### **Prototype (5 minutes)**

Let’s go to the next part of the interview where we are going to share a digital experience we’re working on and ask for your feedback. A few things I want you to know:

You'll be interacting with a prototype that may not work exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. This is very important to know: since it's a demo, we have used fake information, and none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. In this task, we would like to hear your honest feedback. Please comment on what is clear and unclear.

I am going to drop a link in the Zoom chat. When you receive the link, please open the page. Send direct link to Debt Portal prototype Link: ([https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt](https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt)) [Mobile sessions screen share directions] [Sharing screen instructions as needed]

### **Manage your VA debt for benefit overpayments and copay bills [**[**page**](https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt)**] [2-3 minutes]**

● Does this page look familiar to you? No. I don’t think I have ever went on MHV for my bills. I get them on in mail. I have always done this in person or on the phone. If I go up to the VA they have the benefits office and you can talk to them about the issues. I live 90 minutes from there and recently I found out that we have a social worker here at the clinic, she doesn’t handle things like this but what she can do instead of mailing off the paperwork. I can take it to her and she can fax it or take it up there. It sound like this could be helpful. This looks like the other sites where you can look at things and pay online just like everything now. Oh they officer a compromise offer, I didn’t know that. That seems self-explanatory.

● Did you know about this: Yeah, I have looked on the va site for benefits so I have probably seen it but not used it.

● Given your current or recent situation, what are you most interested in on this page? [Mental Models] I  would want to review it and see what it says because the system seems to be updated more than what I get in the mail. Maybe dispute VA copay charges. I would want to talk to someone about it to see if it is legitimate. I have been charged before and when they look at stuff it gets waived.

● Reference copays or debts(letter): I think it says both, it’s a  debt I have to pay.

● Feelings: I don’t really see a difference a copay is a debt. It is the same thing but a different word. I see copay explaining the debt more.

● What’s dispute va overpayments mean: If you click here is this section where I would type in why I am disputing I think it would be choices as to why they are disputing it. Maybe it gives you a different department or why you think it should be.

● Take a moment to show me where on the page you would go to get help with your debt [task]

● I’d like to bring you attention to the ‘Request Financial Help section. [comprehension]

● What are your thoughts about this page? Any information missing that you’d like to see?

● Where on this page would you click on if you wanted help with your debt? Can you point out which links, specifically? Well I am on that page now because its manager your va debt. Here says request financial help, this is if you can’t pay your bill and you can ready that. It gives some options.

● Before you click, what do you understand to be the difference between the first link <[Request help with overpayments and copay bills online](https://zyc78g.csb.app/request-help)> and the second <[Learn about other ways to request help with VA debt](https://zyc78g.csb.app/help-options)> [Mental Models] These two links here. Well, request help with overpayment/copay, and other ways to request help. The first link to me is a specific va option they have, the learn about other ways seems like a broader scope. There is certain assistance for veterans like public assistances. This seems to be broader if you don’t see something up here.

● Which link would you most interested in clicking on first? Why? First link. Then you have to make sure your are on the right page and it says and so it has to be both. Okay then its start your request.

● Expected: kinda, I didn’t have anything specific in mind.

● Click on the second link: Oh okay. This is a lot of options to request help.

● Thoughts on intro: okay so they are covering a lot of different types of debt. Well they do list different types and list different options to see if they pertain to you.

● What stands out to you on this page: The attorney fees. They are not cheap, I don’t understand this one. Are they saying the VA has attorneys that are on VA staff and don’t charge 300 an hour. On a phone an attorney can’t really tell you anything on the phone.

● Anything that applies to you: I don’t know what Vet Tec is. Health care copay this kinda pertains to me but I would still go talk to a person so I don’t get caught in a loop.

● What do you mean: All I know is in the past when I have gone there, they have cubicles and deal with your benefits or get enrolled. I have talked to them in reference to the bill and they have everything there and have access to the information and they can ask be questions about anything in real time. Sometimes there’s a wait and don’t take appointments. They do the numbers; I find them helpful. Also if there’s something they cant do or need help they know what to do and refers it to that section and it goes right there. This is good if people don’t have an option to go to a place like this. I prefer face to face in general if possible for better service. Face to face if I have the option. This is good, it’ll be longer and take a while.

● Gray box, what would you do: I would click on the box.

● Looking at appeals, what’s the difference between the two options: This one tells you why it was decided that way and this on says the decision. Also cant things like this be done with the VSO. I have worked with them in the past, I know they have a wide umbrella that they do a lot of things. I could see veterans going to a VSO so they aren’t bothered by this. Face to face again and the VSO and benefits office, they seem to have a more direct computer system and gets it to who it needs to go to. I think this is good if people have mobility issues, don’t want to go out, or don’t have someone available in the area. It is good to have this option.

● Appeal decision on waiver, how can you do that based on this information: I know everything has to be in writing. Before even reading it I know enough that it ahs to be written out and you  have to submit paperwork. Its not a call or email, it has to be a written letter  preferred typed with submitted documentation.

● Another way they could do it: If I had to appeal I would go to a VSO or go to the hospital with the benefits offices. Every major city I know has one that I know of. I would find out the individuals in the benefits office and meet with them. There are people you can meet with but there are some that don’t meet with people. There are patient advocates as well and they can refer you to others if you don’t know who can handle your case. I am an in-person person.

● Overall experience: it is clear. Easily accessible and a good option.

● Would you change anything: Um. I don’t know they only have that one address where you can send things to. Contact us through Ask VA, I don’t like links like this. Sometimes it doesn’t send me to that email, there should be an email address. I think a fax number but I could see that it could change so maybe not.

● How easy to find information, rate it 1-5: 4-4.5 I am sure there would be something I couldn’t find but I am a researcher that’s what I went to school for.

## **Introductory pages and R&S page (orientation and wayfinding)**

● [Relate or make a connection to what they shared earlier in baseline section about experience resolving their debt]

● Please take some time to browse through this page. Please remember to think aloud

● It has your information to verify; it gives you the options to edit your information and it asks which debt. You can pick which on and if your debt isn’t listed here it gives the number. I would click this debt

● What stands out to you?

● What questions do you have after reviewing this page, if any?

● Which option would you say is relevant to your situation? For me it would be I don’t think I owe the debt because I thought it was included in my benefits. Maybe I thought my bill was only 200 or thought my housing was fully paid. It gives a few choices. If you debt is correct but cant afford it you could click here. I would click there if I couldn’t afford it. Request help with VA and it tells me I have to fill out a different form. It looks good.

Then I can tell them why I am disputing the debt. To my understanding my copays have always been included in my health benefit. I would put something like that and then continue. I am disputing that though right; I didn’t click that. Oh okay. I see. I would just put I don’t think I owe the debt and put I am not familiar with this as a reason.

What does this look like to you: Just a review before clicking submit so you can make sure everything is correct. If I didn’t feel like it waws correct I could fix it. If I thought it was correct I would sign my name and submit dispute. It would go somewhere then I would get an email from the VA Gods that they received it and they’d give a vague turn around time like 60 days. I don’t see it being a quick turnaround.

Filled out something like this before on VA: I have submitted similar forms.

I would print it to keep a copy for myself. Normally they will have a confirmation code to. For me I like to copy and paste it with the confirmation number so I know.

● Can you show me where you might look if you want to see if there is a process to let

● Is this what you expect: Yes basically

● the VA know that you shouldn’t have this debt? [task: finding dispute section]

● If unclear, give a bit more guidance [partial pass]

● Based on what it says here, what is important to know about disputing overpayment debt?

● What could happen after 30 days if you don't make any payments on your debt? [correct answer: could be sent to collections]
