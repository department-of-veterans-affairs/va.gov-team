### Verbatim notes taken by Perigean

## **Getting to know you (10 minutes)**

Hello/Welcome

Thank you so much for your time today. My name is Charlotte and I work at VA.gov - it’s nice to meet you!

How are you today?

I work at VA.gov to help improve access to benefits and services for Veterans like you. This work is meaningful to me because I believe that those who have served have a right to these services. [meaning]

You’ll notice there are a few people on the call already. They’re my colleagues and they’re here to listen and to learn. Is that ok with you? [permission]

My goal today is to learn how easy or difficult it is to use a digital portal we are working on to help you understand how to resolve and resolve VA overpayment debts.

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

Next, I want to explain my role better.

I am a consultant for the VA and my role is to talk to Veterans like you to understand the challenges you face in the space of VA medical copay billing. I am gathering information to help improve the experience of managing or resolving your VA copay bills.

The limits of my role are that I am not the final decision maker on the experience nor am I a financial expert, but I can surface issues and challenges that come up in research to the VA.

Your comfort and well-being are very important to us.

Sensitive topics might come up, and if at any point you want to take a break, please let me know. If you want or need to stop the interview at any point, just let me know. [comfort and consent]

Your identity will be kept confidential, and any information we take away from the interview will be stored securely. [confidentiality]

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more. Yes

_Optional_:

One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like you’re on-screen image.

[Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA.]

At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.

Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?

Do you have any questions for me? No Ma’am

I want to make sure the next 60 minutes are still good for you today? Um yeah but I might look like I am not paying attention I am at work but paying attention.  
  

### **START INTERVIEW**

## **Warm-up**  
[Rapport building]

● We like to start off with a lighthearted question to get to know you better.

● What’s something you enjoy doing these days—any hobbies or routines? OR What's your favorite thing about Spring? Just traveling when I can and spending time with my kids. Either Jamacia or back to CA.

● Thank you for sharing! (personal response)

### **Baseline [5 minutes]**

● Can you briefly tell me what your most recent experience with VA overpayment debt has been and when it appeared? [establish baseline] Yeah it appeared last year when I was in school, I had to drop out early due to family issues. They had already paid me so I have to pay it back. They sent me an email and letter.

● Feeling: A little overwhelmed because I just moved so budgeting to pay it back was a lot. I was expecting it but I didn’t know how much it would be.

● Process: I just made my first payment so I am at the beginning. They have me on a payment plan where it comes out of my compensation at the start of the month.

● How did you apply: I called the debt management center and they sent an invoice to see what I was comfortable with being taken out and they said they would take it out each month. I called the number on the letter. Over the phone

● What, if any, actions have you taken to understand or resolve this debt?

● In 1-3 words, what words would you use to describe the process of understanding and resolving your debt in your experience so far? Very easy. Just with making them sending a notification if I don’t reach out to them for a plan they will take all of it at once. That happened about 5 years ago but this time I had enough time to set up a payment plan I could work with in my budget. So from the first letter they give you they let you know if you don’t reach out they will take what I owe from my disability.

● Enough time for you: Yeah.

● How did it compare to the first time: I don’t recall getting a letter from them for the debt I owe. Last time I looked for the payment but they took it all but they took it all.

● First time you had to reach out instead of the letter: Correct.

● Feelings: It was horrible because I was looking for it to pay bills and it put me in a bind. The second time was very easy.


### **Prototype (5 minutes)**

Let’s go to the next part of the interview where we are going to share a digital experience we’re working on and ask for your feedback. A few things I want you to know:

You'll be interacting with a prototype that may not work exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. This is very important to know: since it's a demo, we have used fake information, and none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. In this task, we would like to hear your honest feedback. Please comment on what is clear and unclear.

I am going to drop a link in the Zoom chat. When you receive the link, please open the page. Send direct link to Debt Portal prototype Link: ([https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt](https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt)) [Mobile sessions screen share directions] [Sharing screen instructions as needed]

### **Manage your VA debt for benefit overpayments and copay bills [**[**page**](https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt)**] [2-3 minutes]**

● Does this page look familiar to you? Yeah. I didn’t go online to do it, recently when I got on in the overview it says your overpayments so it should me. I didn’t go in depth. Just on overpayments in VA.gov.

● Just with reviewing the benefits and how to do a request for financial help because that’s what I had to do then to make the payment. I know the need help because people like me always look for a number; to do it all myself to dispute or financial help really stands out to me. Yeah that was the form they sent me in the mail because I had 5 debts so they combined them and made it into one. It was easier so I didn’t have bits of pieces of different payments. Then they told me how each payment will go to each debt so it doesn’t look like I am only paying one.

● Go through this for repayment: They started to but I sent them I don’t even remember then I called them and they worked it out for me but they did ask for my income and verification of where I stay. Completed by phone and by mail. I was close to the deadline so I just called.

● Given your current or recent situation, what are you most interested in on this page? [Mental Models]

● Take a moment to show me where on the page you would go to get help with your debt [task]

● I’d like to bring you attention to the ‘Request Financial Help section. [comprehension]

● What are your thoughts about this page? Any information missing that you’d like to see?

● Where on this page would you click on if you wanted help with your debt? Can you point out which links, specifically? The request for overpayment and learn other ways to help with va debt.

● Before you click, what do you understand to be the difference between the first link <[Request help with overpayments and copay bills online](https://zyc78g.csb.app/request-help)> and the second <[Learn about other ways to request help with VA debt](https://zyc78g.csb.app/help-options)> [Mental Models] The first one meaning that you are aware of it and trying to setup for a payment plan or get them waivered. Then the second one is to request help in other ways if the debt isn’t yours or had other questions about it.

● Which link would you most interested in clicking on first? Why?

● Please click on the link:

## **Introductory pages and R&S page (orientation and wayfinding)**

● [Relate or make a connection to what they shared earlier in baseline section about experience resolving their debt]

● Please take some time to browse through this page. Please remember to think aloud

● What stands out to you? I didn’t have those I would need to click of the GI Bill link. I only had the GI Bill debt and compensation,. The first debt was due to them not getting my divorce decree so they overpaid me for being married. I felt like it was their error but I had to pay back anyways.

● Any options to help: once they took the first payment and I sent my decree again they put me on a smaller payment plan. I never had issues with the other issues.

● What questions do you have after reviewing this page, if any?

● Which option would you say is relevant to your situation? Just the GI Bill and disability compensation one.

● Gray boxes: I guess depending on the size of your debt and payments that would. (Reading page) I think mine is less than 5 years that I just did.

● Feel about the detail/information: I feel like it is self-explanatory but just like the older vets it could be confusing because the first box was if you can pay it back within 5 years you don’t need to submit it but if its longer than 5 years you need to submit it. I guess it could be broken down depending on the payment amount that could determine if its 5 years or more.

● Unclear: yeah.

● How to make it clear: I understand that if is less than 5 years you don’t need to do that form. This says submit to request help but doesn’t say you have to have it, it needs to say you need to submit it if it is 5 or more years.

● Appeal difference: so I guess I am guessing the decision you can waive how much it is and appeal a decision is if the decision still went through you can appeal or get a wavier again if it wasn’t accepted.

● Can you show me where you might look if you want to see if there is a process to let the VA know that you shouldn’t have this debt? [task: finding dispute section] Dispute the overpayment.

● If unclear, give a bit more guidance [partial pass]

● Based on what it says here, what is important to know about disputing overpayment debt? The time limit in here with it being within 1 year of the first letter and if you disputed it within 30 days so you can avoid collections. You still have to make payments to avoid collections.

● Questions: it was clear on that.

● What could happen after 30 days if you don't make any payments on your debt? [correct answer: could be sent to collections]

● Do you have any questions or concerns after reading this paragraph?

## **Dispute Form**

Before we move on to this next section, I have some questions about the pages you just reviewed.

## **‘Wizard’ Post Task Questions (5 minutes)**

● What was your overall experience with the pages you reviewed until this point? It was clear besides the confusion on payment plans. It is self-explanatory from it but I would still call. I just like to talk to people to make sure I am doing the correct thing. I want to make sure I submit the things.

● Information or rely on the phone: No I would use this to get information. More of a repayment plan and if I felt if it was unnecessary how to pay it to dispute it.

● How did you feel while finding this form? Were there any moments where you felt frustrated or overwhelmed? If so, why?

● What would you change if anything? What can be improved? Was anything unclear? Um just as I said before the terminology if you need the va form 5655, make it clear with the 5 year or more plan you need to submit it rather than the 6 or less you don’t need it. Add more context in the 5 or more-year program.

● We want to know your thoughts on how easy or difficult the experience you reviewed is. When you answer this question, think about how easily you would find information you are most interested in

● On a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being not easy at all, and 5 being very easy, how easy were the pages you reviewed? Me personally a 5 because I would look for it. I would go through a few links but to look for it, it is clear  cut and dry on how to do it.

● Why did you rate it a (rating)?

## **Digital Dispute Intro page**

● What are your thoughts on this page? (reading page) It is cut and dry, straight to the point. You can use it for any benefit overpayments but not copays. It’s the same timeline as the other disputes.

● Is anything unclear?

● Do you have any concerns after reading this paragraph?

### **Prompt**

● Please go ahead and go through this form, imagining you were filling this form out. I want to remind you that the information filled out in this demo is fake information.

● Please remember to talk aloud and point out anything that is unclear or confusing:

Okay this looked like mine. Yes both of the options applied for me during the GI bill debt. No they both did apply to me disability and GI bill.

Thoughts on only being able to select one: it allowed me to check both of them but I guess you have to go through one then the other because it could be in two different departments. They should put the GI bill up here then the second part should be down here. Clicking through this it says one of two it might make people to think they didn’t click both so they might keep going back and forth and think they are doing something wrong and end up calling in.

● Do any of these reasons apply to you? Which one would you select and why?  
[Reason for dispute page - entry field]

● What type of information would you include in this section? Just like if I broke the time down that it would be like I would ask how they got the amount, the time in school or the full amount. I would still call to see how it is broken down to make sure it is an accurate amount.

Okay there goes the second one. It doesn’t say why I owe it but I guess they would know if it’s the spouse thing or if its their error.

[ Review and submit page]: just a recap to make sure they did everything and you can go back and change it. It also has the statement of truth and when you click submit your words are what you understand. You can print this page to know I submitted.

● Do they expand the accordion?

● Any concerns on this page? No it is cut and dry.

### **DIGITAL DISPUTE MENTAL MODELS**

● Now that you've gone through this form, I'd like to take some time to reflect and hear about how your experience was today. Please only comment on your experience with the form.

● How did you feel while completing this form? Were there any moments where you felt frustrated or overwhelmed? If so, why? Besides like what I said earlier about it all on one back to know if you clicked on all of the debts. Just frustrated/concerned with knowing if I clicked the right debt.

● Do you feel confident about what actions you need to take next? Very because it ells me it takes 5 days for them to receive it then they will mail you a letter on the decisions. It doesn’t tell you how long it could take them besides them getting the form. It is a wait game so probably after a month I would call if I didn’t hear anything. I feel like 30 days they should know they have it and working on it if there isn’t already a decisions.

● Did you know this option to resolve your debt existed? Yeah.

● Have you encountered something similar to this process before?

● How does this compare?

● What did you expect to see on this form that wasn’t there if anything? Was anything missing?

● When you answer this next question, think about how easily you would be able to fill out this form

● On a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being not easy at all, and 5 being very easy, how easy to understand fill out was this form? I would give it a 5 it is easy for me.

● Why did you rate it a (rating)?

## **Whole Experience Post Task Questions (5 minutes)**

● Now thinking about the experience from start to finish, how was your experience? Was anything difficult? Was anything easy? I would give it an 8 because of the little confusions here and there. I would do this if I had gone here at the beginning instead of waiting until the deadline.

● What would you change if anything? What can be improved? Was anything unclear?

Those are all the questions that I had for you today.

## **Permission to use clips with internal VA partners**

● Circling back about the optional use of clips with internal VA partners. Now that you know what we’ve discussed, are you still comfortable with this? Yes

● Do you have any questions for me or is there anything else that you think that I should know?

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it works well for all Veterans.

**[End of session]**

## **Emergency Exit**

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so it’s easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
