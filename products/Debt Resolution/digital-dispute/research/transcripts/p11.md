### Verbatim notes taken by Perigean

# AT Conversation Guide for Financial Management Team, R/S Page & Digital Dispute, May 2025 

## **Getting to know you (10 minutes)**

Welcome!

Thank you so much for your time today. My name is Charlotte and I work at VA.gov - it’s nice to meet you!

How are you today?

I work at VA.gov to help improve access to benefits and services for Veterans like you. This work is meaningful to me because I believe that those who have served have a right to these services. [meaning]

You’ll notice there are a few people on the call already. They’re my colleagues and they’re here to listen and to learn. Is that ok with you? [permission]

My goal today is to understand how usable and accessible an experience we’re working on is.

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

Next, I want to explain my role better.

I am a consultant for the VA and my role is to talk to Veterans like you to understand the challenges you face in the space of VA medical copay billing. I am gathering information to help improve the experience of managing or resolving your VA copay bills.

The limits of my role are that I am not the final decision maker on the experience nor am I a financial expert, but I can surface issues and challenges that come up in research to the VA.

Your comfort and well-being are very important to us.

Sensitive topics might come up, and if at any point you want to take a break, please let me know. If you want or need to stop the interview at any point, just let me know. [comfort and consent]

Your identity will be kept confidential, and any information we take away from the interview will be stored securely. [confidentiality]

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more. Yes.

**Optional**:

One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like you’re on-screen image.

[Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA.]

At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.

Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences? No a problem.

Do you have any questions for me? Nope.

Just want to ensure the next 75 minutes are still good for you today? I was told an hour so I have another 55 minutes.

**START INTERVIEW**

3-5 minutes

[Rapport building]

  
  

· We like to start off with a lighthearted question to get to know you better.

· What's your favorite thing about Spring? I have young kids so I had hobbies, when I get to have hobbies I am an avid scuba diver. Very clear, color fish and reefs. It is beautiful. About 12 - 13 years scuba diving. Army started me but now it is a lot more fun.

· Thank you for sharing! (personal response)

## **[Intro to study] (5 minutes)**

Now we’ll start the more formal interview.

Today I will be sharing a survey on VA.gov to help orient you to the right place depending on your unique situation with VA copays or VA debt.

## **Warm-up Questions - (3-5 minutes)**

Before we look at the design prototype, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

· What device are you using today? MacBook.

· Does the device you're using have a screen to share? Yes

· What type of screenreader or other assistive technology are you using? (Voiceover? Something else?) Voiceover.

· How comfortable are you using your screenreader, how long have you been using it? I have been using it for 2 years now, I am pretty comfortable. I know you typically have a tech expert that shows me things I haven’t figured out yet so that’s always cool.

### Prototype (5 minutes)

Let’s go to the next part of the interview where we are going to share a digital experience we’re working on and ask for your feedback. A few things I want you to know:

You'll be interacting with a prototype that may not work exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. This is very important to know: since it's a demo, we have used fake information, and none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. In this task, we would like to hear your honest feedback. Please comment on what is clear and unclear.

I am going to drop a link in the Zoom chat. When you receive the link, please open the page. Send direct link to Debt Portal prototype Link: ([https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt](https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt)) [Mobile sessions screen share directions] [Sharing screen instructions as needed]

## **Conversation guide questions for intro pages paths**

**Manage Your VA Debt Page  
  
**

· What stands out to you on this page? It is normal looking va website page, standard stuff. It would be nice to select what you want instead of it reading all of it. It seems to be reading more than typical. Overall standard va website, pretty easy to navigate. It has sub links. No questions. I would be able to figure out where to do. It was frustrating because if you want something further down you have to let it go all the way through. It is jumping around when I scroll down. Here it ducks back up but that could be a prototype thing. It is a little choppy but works with some of the area. Oh jeeze now the mouse has a mind of its own, it is click everything.

· Information: it is about the same, the general structure is the same. The va websites seem to be longer without buried subpages. I prefer that because the area like blue button, you have to click so many different hyperlinks to get to something you have to keep drilling down. I like this where there’s general categories, I like scrolling instead of changing pages.

· [Task]

· Imagine you wanted to find links on this page to get help with VA overpayments and VA debts. Can you please explore the page and point out which links are to get help?

· How many links are there?

· [Task, if only found one link]

I would start here. That would be another link. I mean dispute your va overpayment.

· Can you please find the link on the page to find out other ways to request help with VA debt? I mean that’s another option if you want to try to call the VA, I wouldn’t recommend it based on my experience.

· Please click on the link

**Options to request help with VA debt (R&S page)**

· Please take some time to explore this page and let me know if you have any concerns

VA dark mode: It is normally like the last page which I found on this page as odd. I wrote it off as the prototype.

· What is clear?

· What is unclear?

· What are your thoughts on the amount of content on this page? Is it too much or just enough? I mean overall I think it is an appropriate amount of information with the topic. It hits the major areas then has subpages if you need more information on a certain aspect.

· How does another area compare: Seems about right for content wise

· Pattern on va.gov: Yes. It is fine. I would rather have the expanded content again instead of hyperlinks in different windows

· Imagine you wanted to dispute an overpayment. Please show me where you might go to find information to help you dispute this overpayment: It is a little choppy but right here.

· [Can they expand the menu?] I would click the plus sign.

· How do you feel about the amount of information you had to review before finding this information to dispute your debt? My thought why not have the form right here under the paragraph. What to know before then the instructions on the form.

**Dispute Your Debt Form**

· Please take some time to go through this form, imagining you had to fill it out. I will quietly observe.

Okay, start your dispute. I would click this. Alright. I would double check the validity of the information then go to the next page. Just keep on going. Straightforward, I don’t know why you wouldn’t have this on the last page. It is the standard demographics so why break it into different pages. The same type of information should be on the same page instead of broken up. It breaks the debt down if you have more than one. It makes you pick one of those. I think maybe these are the two most common on. Maybe there would be another option such as other but I assume these are the common dispute. There could be another option.

Va debt before: No.

What next: Duplicate to me, you just selected why you are disputing it. Maybe to give background to it but I don’t see how you aren’t typing the same thing you just clicked.

Error message: Normal hard stop to make you aware it is required and you cannot advance unless it is satisfied.

What does this page refer to: The second debt.

Review page: Okay I would sign off as Hector. It is the normal va page, pretty standard to get a recap to confirm accuracy. Not good not bad, just expected.

Confirmation page:  Okay, the review then they will send you a letter.

· Please pause at any areas on the pages where you have any concerns or feedback.

## **Post Task Questions (5 minutes)**

· What was your overall experience with the pages you reviewed? I will exclude prototype things but overall standard normal va process. Confirm information put in details look at summary then it will give vague what to expect next.

· What similar information combined, feel that way on other sections as well: before submitting you can review it all then it gives it to you after you submitted but you should’ve already reviewed that and then you can print so it checks the box to make sure everything was placed in accurately.

· What are your thoughts on the amount of pages you had to review to be able to get to the Dispute Form? (AT specific Q)

· Was there any information missing?

· What would you change if anything? What can be improved? Was anything unclear?

<On this page> >> table of contents

Massive list of sections into different pages, easier for mobile pages

Easier to find controls – activate accordion, click thru content, before form link

· What was the easiest part if anything?

In the next few questions, I'm going to ask you to rate different aspects of the experience you reviewed today.

· The first is clarity, and how clear the information was on the experience. On a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being not clear at all, and 5 being very clear, how clear was the experience as a whole? I would give it a 4, I wasn’t lost or couldn’t find something. Everything was there.

· The second is under stability, and how understandable the information was on the portal. On a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being not understandable at all, and 5 being very understandable, how understandable was the experience as a whole? I would go with 4, no major questions. It seemed straightforward, no challenges. Pretty good.

Questions: No but I will tweak on how I can use my VoiceOver to make it easier to use.

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it works well for all Veterans.
