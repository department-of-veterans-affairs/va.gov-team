## **Getting to know you (10 minutes)**

Hello/Welcome

Thank you so much for your time today. My name is Charlotte and I work at VA.gov - it’s nice to meet you!

How are you today?

I work at VA.gov to help improve access to benefits and services for Veterans like you. This work is meaningful to me because I believe that those who have served have a right to these services. [meaning]

You’ll notice there are a few people on the call already. They’re my colleagues and they’re here to listen and to learn. Is that ok with you? [permission]

My goal today is to learn how easy or difficult it is to use a digital portal we are working on to help you understand how to resolve and resolve VA overpayment debts.

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

Next, I want to explain my role better.

I am a consultant for the VA and my role is to talk to Veterans like you to understand the challenges you face in the space of VA medical copay billing. I am gathering information to help improve the experience of managing or resolving your VA copay bills.

The limits of my role are that I am not the final decision maker on the experience nor am I a financial expert, but I can surface issues and challenges that come up in research to the VA.

Your comfort and well-being are very important to us.

Sensitive topics might come up, and if at any point you want to take a break, please let me know. If you want or need to stop the interview at any point, just let me know. [comfort and consent]

Your identity will be kept confidential, and any information we take away from the interview will be stored securely. [confidentiality]

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more. Yes

_Optional_:

One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like you’re on-screen image.

[Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA.]

At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.

Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences? Yeah that would be great.

Do you have any questions for me? Not yet.

I want to make sure the next 60 minutes are still good for you today? Yes it is.  
  

### **START INTERVIEW**

## **Warm-up**  
[Rapport building]

● We like to start off with a lighthearted question to get to know you better.

● What’s something you enjoy doing these days—any hobbies or routines? OR What's your favorite thing about Spring? I like writing about my life story. I actually have two kids books already. I do the writing and hired the illustrator for the fun part of the book. The writing part was an amazing journey for me. 

● Thank you for sharing! (personal response)

### **Baseline [5 minutes]**

● Can you briefly tell me what your most recent experience with VA overpayment debt has been and when it appeared? [establish baseline] Recently was 3 months ago for overpayment. I felt like dealing with the va was like capital one. I felt like I was being attacked, I would call I would talk to someone in person at the center. I felt like I was treated as I wasn’t important and the overpayment debt wasn’t relevant to the other issues at the va. They mentioned to me that we3ll quick questions, have you reported the income change or household change and failure to report it could cause imprisonment meant. I reported I moved and they knew I moved. I felt violated and disrespected. I spoke to my local councilman and the actions I need to take due to this. I wrote a letter, maybe 3 months after I wrote another letter. They told me they were willing to write to them on my behalf and were willing to give me legal counsel free of charge. I just wanted to bring awareness to what veterans deal with for overpayments. They said I lack misunderstanding and I need to take care of it or they would arrest me for overpayment which is bizarre. I wanted to raise awareness because there are a lot of issues veterans go through. It sounds like VA cares but there are a lot of issues. I wanted to talk about housing, education, career development, and records. They aren’t really helping people I speak to people when there and nothing is being done and we are treated unfairly.

● Concerns addressed: no I reached out the new stations. I wrote into them because at this point I was angry and I got one letter in the process of it and I think one news station reached out. I think one or two more letters before the better letter came I needed to take action in my own hands. I felt like I was being pushed around

● What was a good letter: it was as arrogant as the others; they have a process of 30 business days and working on figuring out the overpayment. Lets work together and then there were names and emails and information. Once I spoke with them one was fired, one laid off, and then one just didn’t respond. No closure even with the new channels and I filed a police report when a gentlemen yelled at me and had me taken out by security. They didn’t want me drawing a scene and they shoved me out the door at that point.

● What would be closed at this point: explain the overpayment debt, talk to me about my options, listen actively and understand there’s no overpayment debt. It is false and I don’t even have it. Then education program I was in that I was never in and they added housing I wasn’t in. I have documentations that it is false.

● What, if any, actions have you taken to understand or resolve this debt?

● In 1-3 words, what words would you use to describe the process of understanding and resolving your debt in your experience so far? Harassment, manipulation, and discriminations. I am a woman that has a lot of vulnerability, they were more mature and thought they were smarter than me. They didn’t feel like I had strength. I am not very tall and my weight and me being a women. I felt like they wanted to take advantage of me.

## **Warm-up Questions - (3-5 minutes)**

Before we look at the design prototype, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

● What device are you using today? Mobile

● Does the device you're using have a screen to share?

● What type of screenreader or other assistive technology are you using? (Voiceover? Something else?)

● How comfortable are you using your screenreader, how long have you been using it?

### **Prototype (5 minutes)**

Let’s go to the next part of the interview where we are going to share a digital experience we’re working on and ask for your feedback. A few things I want you to know:

You'll be interacting with a prototype that may not work exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. This is very important to know: since it's a demo, we have used fake information, and none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. In this task, we would like to hear your honest feedback. Please comment on what is clear and unclear.

I am going to drop a link in the Zoom chat. When you receive the link, please open the page. Send direct link to Debt Portal prototype Link: ([https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt](https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt)) [Mobile sessions screen share directions] [Sharing screen instructions as needed]

### **Manage your VA debt for benefit overpayments and copay bills [**[**page**](https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt)**] [2-3 minutes]**

● Does this page look familiar to you? More helpful information, I like additional details. I feel like it helps me if I am stuck. Here request financial help, it wasn’t me struggling it was needing help with misconceptions. It’s there but I don’t know why its there. I would need help to know why it is there.

● Where would you find something related to that: Here I already know about disputing but I didn’t create the debt. I would disputing they would be like its yours. It doesn’t belong to me so I’m not disputing anything so give me someone live to talk to or face to face not AI. I need a person that understand and can talk.

● Why the live person important: I need someone that can listen for a second, maybe over the phone since in person people get aggressive. They see a women and they talk at you not to you. Even if its another woman they are way aggressive. I feel like in person the conversation goes nowhere.

● What would you expect the process to be called: No real debt, speed up the process, no hassle.

● Given your current or recent situation, what are you most interested in on this page? [Mental Models]

● Take a moment to show me where on the page you would go to get help with your debt [task]

● I’d like to bring you attention to the ‘Request Financial Help section. [comprehension]

● What are your thoughts about this page? Any information missing that you’d like to see?

● Where on this page would you click on if you wanted help with your debt? Can you point out which links, specifically? Let’s see I just saw it. Request financial help, what do you do if you have questions about a debt or bill. I mean that doesn’t really help when you go there, it’s like what no. It throughs you back into the cage, its more or less a washout. Help with overpayment or copay, its not really like you are getting help you are on your own. Learn about different was to request help, look for detailed information.

● Before you click, what do you understand to be the difference between the first link <[Request help with overpayments and copay bills online](https://zyc78g.csb.app/request-help)> and the second <[Learn about other ways to request help with VA debt](https://zyc78g.csb.app/help-options)> [Mental Models] Overpayment is overpayment and that’s really want you need, the other is regular debt not an overpayment. Its huge difference. Two different types of assistance.

● Wording on second link: it takes someone that is really a thinker, I think what is current that’s what pulls my eyes. I don’t see pay due nothing beyond that. I wouldn’t look at 4-5 months down the line.

● Which link would you most interested in clicking on first? Why?

● Please click on the link

## **Introductory pages and R&S page (orientation and wayfinding)**

● [Relate or make a connection to what they shared earlier in baseline section about experience resolving their debt]

● Please take some time to browse through this page. Please remember to think aloud

● What stands out to you? Appeal va decision for va overpayment. Appeals would be helpful; I have done that already. You know there’s a lot of loopholes around that. Just knowing you can do that and have support on your side, knowing its an option for you.

● Difference between appeals: supplemental claim, higher level, or board review. Theres a different level of support for the appeal. You might have more assistance. Then here is appeal on decision request, they are giving it thought. You mail it in and then they get a second eye on it so there’s another group of people that say yes or no. in most cases from my experience the committee will look at it and say she will own it and take responsibility. They aren’t going to go through everything with a fine-tooth comb, there will still be a loophole before the process is over.

● What would give you assurance it was look at: Well I don’t really know I don’t have that. I just want to know as a person that they are taking consideration and taking care of documentation and taking it in a serious manner. That they care about the veterans. Do I believe that no. People need to take accountability but in my experience they don’t. They don’t take care about people or there’s careless people and it lands on another desk where it falls into line or something happens as someone like myself is looked at like its my fault or they could careless either way. It’s not what I believe it’s what I have seen the past 10 years in education, medical professions, and the VA. The future is getting worse. By the end of 25 I will be lucky to see a doctor. Talking about debt, we will all be in debt because the systems are broken or dismantled. It wont be like 2024. When I say 10 years I say it hasn’t been that bad as January. I haven’t received the resources/assistance, just the small service benefits that someone deserves isn’t there. The whole health insurance plans have been tampered with. Theres so much I have dealt with like what do we do hit the picket lines. They need to have quality care and resources for veterans. It has been a long dark roller coaster ride. Quality care I am not talking the doctor playing ticktacktoe. Its like me asking for testing for gut trouble. I haven’t been seen or called and when I ask for an appointment they wont give me one. Then when they do answer they have an attitude. Then they push me out to someone else.

● Dispute area: there should be collections. If they are disputing there shouldn’t be a collection. Its like a credit card. They are attacking someone for something that isn’t even their fault. As an individual you are the bad guy for something you didn’t even do, you carry the burden. Why dispute 30 days. It takes that for an appointment; it takes that for them to realize you are a patient it takes that for them just to say hi. I don’t agree and find it insulting.

● Thoughts on next few pages, what to click next to start the process: start my dispute

● Did you know this existed: yes but I know its nothing and not worth it. It makes people believe it is important but it’s not relevant. I went through the process and it put me right back to nothing.

● What questions do you have after reviewing this page, if any?

● Which option would you say is relevant to your situation?

● Can you show me where you might look if you want to see if there is a process to let the VA know that you shouldn’t have this debt? [task: finding dispute section]

● If unclear, give a bit more guidance [partial pass]

● Based on what it says here, what is important to know about disputing overpayment debt?

● What could happen after 30 days if you don't make any payments on your debt? [correct answer: could be sent to collections]

● Do you have any questions or concerns after reading this paragraph?

## **Dispute Form**

Before we move on to this next section, I have some questions about the pages you just reviewed.

● Did you know this existed: yes but I know it’s nothing and not worth it. It makes people believe it is important but it’s not relevant. I went through the process and it put me right back to nothing.

● It was stupid, wasn’t helpful, and didn’t give me the support I needed. I needed something on my side all the time not just half of the time

● Does va help with that: they are there but they aren’t doing anything.

● Who are those representatives: bill management, debt relief management. They literally just buy time and manipulate the situation and they say they will help but nothing happens.

● This is user friendly. If you are computer literate you can go through its all customized. I have friends that don’t know anything and this would be helpful. Maybe this open field they might mess up because they might not understand what they are doing. They might need support completing this part.

● What about you personally:  No I prefer the on the phone. In person didn’t work. So I would prefer over the phone, online is the duplicate of me crying out for help and being ignored. It just feels like you are wasting your time they aren’t trying to help and doesn’t work toward the benefit of helping.

● If you were sharing the reason, what would you want them to know: That it is a false debt and I am being spoken to improper. The letters when it started. I would let them understand what happened so they can understand. Sometimes they don’t get a dialog with dates and understand the timeline and don’t know how it did not work for me.

● Dates: like when I first got the debt and saw someone then when I wrote letters to a councilman . You need a timeline and a story line and if you don’t give that they will assume it is be.

● How do you track dates: I have them on my calendar, I journal, I have the letters, I have everything to reference date.

● How did you find the date of debt: the representative told me, being aggressive and poking them. The letter had the date and everything on it.

● I like it all being customized right there for me and I have it all in front of me and I can print this page. I like that I can have it on my records as well. The outline, reference, and it could be useful for others that haven’t been treated like I have in my experiences.

● Would you use this going forward: I would possibly consider it.
