## **Getting to know you (10 minutes)**

Hello/Welcome

Thank you so much for your time today. My name is Charlotte and I work at VA.gov - it’s nice to meet you!

How are you today?

I work at VA.gov to help improve access to benefits and services for Veterans like you. This work is meaningful to me because I believe that those who have served have a right to these services. [meaning]

You’ll notice there are a few people on the call already. They’re my colleagues and they’re here to listen and to learn. Is that ok with you? [permission]

My goal today is to learn how easy or difficult it is to use a digital portal we are working on to help you understand how to resolve and resolve VA overpayment debts.

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

Next, I want to explain my role better.

I am a consultant for the VA and my role is to talk to Veterans like you to understand the challenges you face in the space of VA medical copay billing. I am gathering information to help improve the experience of managing or resolving your VA copay bills.

The limits of my role are that I am not the final decision maker on the experience nor am I a financial expert, but I can surface issues and challenges that come up in research to the VA.

Your comfort and well-being are very important to us.

Sensitive topics might come up, and if at any point you want to take a break, please let me know. If you want or need to stop the interview at any point, just let me know. [comfort and consent]

Your identity will be kept confidential, and any information we take away from the interview will be stored securely. [confidentiality]

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more. Yes I am.

_Optional_:

One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like you’re on-screen image.

[Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA.]

At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.

Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences? Yes.

Do you have any questions for me? No

I want to make sure the next 60 minutes are still good for you today? Yes  
  

### **START INTERVIEW**

## **Warm-up**  
[Rapport building]

● We like to start off with a lighthearted question to get to know you better.

● What’s something you enjoy doing these days—any hobbies or routines? OR What's your favorite thing about Spring? No not at all, I am a mom. I work and go home and relax. Its not as hot as summer, gets hot.

● Thank you for sharing! (personal response)

### **Baseline [5 minutes]**

● Can you briefly tell me what your most recent experience with VA overpayment debt has been and when it appeared? [establish baseline] So lets see 2021 or 2022 after covid and then post covid. There was an overpayment and it caught me by surprise. I don’t like overpayments. I feel like it wasn’t my fault. I was able to work with them. They were going to offset my va benefits, I couldn’t afford for them to do that. I went on here and submitted a waiver to forgive the debt. I was really relieved. It didn’t take long. I think I did it electronically. It was simple and no one was working at that time. It was seamless. It didn’t take long no more than 2-3 weeks from what I remember. They sent me an approval for it to be waived.

● What, if any, actions have you taken to understand or resolve this debt?

● In 1-3 words, what words would you use to describe the process of understanding and resolving your debt in your experience so far? Easy, understandable, smooth.

● Apportionment, when another person takes custody of my children the court submit documents for them to take part of my benefit to give to my mom while I was away to take care of my daughter.

## **Warm-up Questions - (3-5 minutes)**

Before we look at the design prototype, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

● What device are you using today?

● Does the device you're using have a screen to share?

● What type of screenreader or other assistive technology are you using? (Voiceover? Something else?)

● How comfortable are you using your screenreader, how long have you been using it?

### **Prototype (5 minutes)**

Let’s go to the next part of the interview where we are going to share a digital experience we’re working on and ask for your feedback. A few things I want you to know:

You'll be interacting with a prototype that may not work exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. This is very important to know: since it's a demo, we have used fake information, and none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. In this task, we would like to hear your honest feedback. Please comment on what is clear and unclear.

I am going to drop a link in the Zoom chat. When you receive the link, please open the page. Send direct link to Debt Portal prototype Link: ([https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt](https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt)) [Mobile sessions screen share directions] [Sharing screen instructions as needed]

### **Manage your VA debt for benefit overpayments and copay bills [**[**page**](https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt)**] [2-3 minutes]**

● Does this page look familiar to you? Yes. I have seen this before. It is broken down where to can review debt, options to make payments. What I did if you are not able to pay it due to other obligations you can have it waived or compromised. You can dispute the charges, I like how its broken down for understanding.

● Anything different: No not at all.

● Given your current or recent situation, what are you most interested in on this page? [Mental Models]

● Take a moment to show me where on the page you would go to get help with your debt [task] You would go here after signing in. I see here you would go to request financial help or review it to make a payment. Other options you can click this link. Either link can help you.

● I’d like to bring you attention to the ‘Request Financial Help section. [comprehension]

● What are your thoughts about this page? Any information missing that you’d like to see?

● Where on this page would you click on if you wanted help with your debt? Can you point out which links, specifically?

● Before you click, what do you understand to be the difference between the first link <[Request help with overpayments and copay bills online](https://zyc78g.csb.app/request-help)> and the second <[Learn about other ways to request help with VA debt](https://zyc78g.csb.app/help-options)> [Mental Models] I want to say it is just opening your options to satisfy the debt if it was something that wasn’t your fault but the va has to do what they have to do. It will provide more options and what’s best for you.

● Which link would you most interested in clicking on first? Why?

● Please click on the link:

## **Introductory pages and R&S page (orientation and wayfinding)**

● [Relate or make a connection to what they shared earlier in baseline section about experience resolving their debt]

● What stands out to you?

● What questions do you have after reviewing this page, if any?

● Which option would you say is relevant to your situation? Yes. I think it was the debt relief/ waiver option.

● Difference on top two options: Well the first one you want to pay it and the second one is to waive it because I cant afford it.

● Go ahead and click on the gray boxes: You can pay it in 5 years and less or 5 year or more.

● Appeal options: (Reading page) this one allows you to submit evidence if you think it is an error. Then the board of appeals, they give you the option to take it up higher if you disagree. Did I go back to far.

● Can you show me where you might look if you want to see if there is a process to let the VA know that you shouldn’t have this debt? [task: finding dispute section]

● If unclear, give a bit more guidance [partial pass]

● Based on what it says here, what is important to know about disputing overpayment debt?
