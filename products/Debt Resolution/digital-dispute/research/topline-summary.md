**The goal of this document is:**

## Initial Findings


### R&S page: Options to request help with VA debt


**Finding 1: Overall Usability**


- Overall participants found the Resources & Support page easy to navigate, and they liked that all of the information needed was on one page. 
    
- All participants expanded the accordion with no issues. 
    
- The 2 screen reader users we interviewed (who interacted with the prototype) expanded the accordion with no issues as well.

  >"... it breaks down everything that you can actually talk about. And then it's a hyperlink for anything that you need to talk about it. It talks about yourself as a veteran. It talks about family members, it talks about schooling, and you know, and it gives you the hyperlink, so you can actually dive into it. So like I said, it's pretty much self-explanatory, like, I can't see how somebody can get confused on it because it's walking you through the steps." -P13 (screen reader user)


**Finding 2: Comprehension**

**Disability compensation, pension, and GI Bill benefits**


We identified a few improvements to begin thinking about:

- The wording on the headers of the accordion for the FSR Repayment plan 'more than 5 years' and 'less than 5 years'  was confusing to a few participants: 

The point of confusion for a few participants was the following: 

- Is it referring to an overpayment debt that happened more than  5 years ago/ less than 5 years ago OR is it referring to the repayment plan extended over more than 5 years / less than 5 years?

- Participants interpreted both in these interviews.
  
  > "But this repayment plan of more than 5 years or debt relief, what does that mean? I need to repay over more than 5 years. Or does that mean I need to repay something from over 5 years ago?... If it said, like more than 2 years, I would think, okay, that's me because my debt was from more than 2 years ago. It would occur to me to say, 'oh, I need more than 5 years to pay this back'... I mean no debt that anybody has in any part of their life comes back to you and says, Hey, do you need more than 5 years to pay this. Well, I don't know. Let's compute how much the payments would be, and then I'll tell you." -P18

        

**Finding 3: Some sections on R&S page were too vague:**

**Rogers STEM Scholarship, VET TEC program, Separation pay, Attorney fees**

- Some participants found the content on certain sections of the R&S page were too vague to understand. 
- Several participants were confused by these header titles (heading 2), not having experienced these types of debt before, and a few assumed or questioned if these were actions they could take for their debt, such as hiring an attorney.

Recommendation or solution: 

- Add the word "debt" next to every section title for additional clarity
- Adding more context under the section titles for clarity

> "I don't know what stem scholarships are, but I might be there as separation pay. That might be it, attorney, I don't know... and I don't think you can really fix this to make it better. But it's frustrating that you guys can't seem to find some English words." -P4

> "VA doesn't pay attorney fees, wait, do they?" -P18

### Dispute Form 

**Finding 4: The Dispute Form was easy and straightforward**

- Some participants mentioned they would like to see an example statement to know what information to provide in the open text field on the form.
- Some participants mentioned they would like an option to edit the information on the Review Page.
- Some participants mentioned they would like a way to upload important documents.

  > "I think it's a good amount of information. And I like how it has the "Start your dispute" right above there, like you don't have to go to into a totally different section in order to fill out forms..." -P2
  
  > "I like it because it's very direct. So you know, sometimes, like the website can be daunting and things like that. But, like, with this format, it's very direct. I knew pretty much what I would expect when I clicked on here, and it met those expectations." -P3
