#  Research  Plan  for  [Financial Management Team,  R&S page (and intro pages) and Digital Dispute Form,  May 2025]


## Background 🏗️ <summary></summary>

### ‘Wizard’ (formerly Wizard, now intro pages that orient the Veteran: Manage VA Debt page, “Options to request help with VA debt” R&S page (“Wizard”), FSR intro page)


<Details>

As of most recently, OCTO Content Team have opted for a static R&S page describing different financial help option within content nested in an accordion. This new approach reduces the need for Veterans to click through different pages and reduces cognitive load. </Details>

### Digital Dispute Form


<Details>

If a Veteran has a VA debt that they would like to dispute there is currently no formalized process for them to follow. Disputes can currently be submitted in a variety of formats (verbal, written, etc.) and the information required is not clearly defined. This experience can be confusing for Veterans and inefficient as additional information may need to be collected from the Veteran for the VA to process the dispute effectively.

-   Ability to dispute either the existence or amount of a VA Debt
    
-   Easy access to user-friendly process with clear instructions and minimal and simple input required from user.
    
-   Clear understanding of timelines and next steps in the dispute process
    
-   Ability to submit a written statement to present their individual situation and reasoning for disputing the debt.
    
-   Receives an email confirmation of their debt dispute submission.
     </details>

## [OCTO-DE Priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202025.md)

Which OCTO priorities does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

This research supports these main [OCTO objectives and goals](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme):

 
1.  Veterans and their families can apply for all benefits online
    
2.  Veterans can manage their health services online
    
3.  Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
    
4.  Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features ***
    
5.  Veterans and their families trust the security accuracy and relevancy of VA.gov
    

#### This research supports increasing these measures:


<Details>
Objective 1: VA’s digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.

-   Key Result 1: Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.
    
-   Key Result 2: We have reduced the total time Veterans spend waiting for a response from our digital experiences by 50%, towards a goal of less than 4 seconds per transaction.
    

Objective 2: OCTO’s platforms are the fastest, most efficient, and most secure way to deliver products at VA.

-   Key Result 4: Each of our platforms* and tools increase the number of non-OCTO built capabilities or non-OCTO users by 50%. (*excluding mobile)
     

-   Usage of digital, self- service tools
    
-   Percent of applications submitted online (vs. paper)
    
-   Number of VA.gov users as a function of total Veteran population
    

-   These users are segmented by Veteran OR non-Veteran and by Level of Assurance (LoA).
    
-   “Total Veteran population” is the current count of living Veterans.
    

-   Completion rate of online transactions
    
-   Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov
    
-   Benefit value (in $) delivered from online applications or transactions
    

</Details>

  

#### This research supports decreasing these measures:


<Details>


-   Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution
    
-   Time from online benefit discovery to benefit delivery
    
-   Time to successful complete and submit online transactions
    
-   Time to process online applications (vs. paper)
    

</Details>

  

### [Veteran Journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)

Where does your product fit into the Veteran journey? Are there moments that matter?


Other key moments this research touches in the Veteran journey are:

-   Attending to health needs
    
-   Taking care of myself
    
-   Managing my declining health
   
  

## Research Goals 🥅

What are you trying to learn from this research?
  

### The purpose of this research is to find out:
    
### As a unified, connected experience: 

### 1. Navigation, wayfinding, preexisting mental models

-   How do Veterans navigate and find information in the intro pages all the way to the digital dispute form?
    
-   How do their preexisting mental models inform their experience navigating?
    

### As distinct products:

### 2. Usability & Comprehension

#### “Wizard” / intro page and R&S page

-   How easily can Veterans navigate and find information that pertains to their debt or copay situation?
    
-   To what extent does the provided information regarding options for their situation prove helpful?
    

-   Do they understand the paths available to them and the actions they need to take based on the information provided in the wizard?
    
-   What mental models do Veterans have around the resolution options as they pertain to their unique situation?
    

#### Digital Dispute


-   How easily can Veterans understand the option of digital dispute based on how it is explained on R&S page and in the form?


-   How easily can Veterans navigate the form?

  
-   What, if any concerns are there? 

### 3. Mental Models: How helpful is the information provided based on their prior knowledge and experiences, if any?

  
## Outcome

How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?

- This research will help us evaluate and validate the new R&S page and associated links to the page stemming from the introductory pages of the debt portal
- This research will help us evaluate and validate the Digital Dispute form the team designed recently and it will be ready for frontend implementation 


## Research questions


Consider bucketing research questions under research goals and think about:

What will I do with what I learn from this question?

Does this question serve the goals of my study?


1.  **Understand baseline & mental models**: What experience, if any, do Veterans have with seeking debt relief and contesting VBA/VHA charges? What channels have they used to understand what they need to do? How easy is it for them to understand what they need to do through the information supplied in the 'Wizard' in contrast to what they have done previously?
    
2.  **Understand Navigation & Wayfinding**: How easy is it for Veterans to navigate the Manage VA Debt page, “Options to request help with VA debt” R&S page (“Wizard”), FSR intro page, Digital Dispute form debt portal, from the intro pages all the way to finding the information they need?

**Measuring**: time to complete tasks, error rates
    
3. **Understand Findability & Wayfinding**: How easy is it for Veterans to find the digital dispute form? (findability)

**Measuring**: time to complete tasks
    
4. **Understand Findability & Wayfinding**: Given that there are 2 paths Veterans can take to find the dispute form, which one do most Veterans take to find the dispute form? (this will be a task, and we will measure time on task)
   
5. **Understand Comprehension**: How understandable is the information on the “Options to request help with VA debt” R&S page? 
    
6. **Understand Usability & Comprehension**: How is navigation and understanding of the Digital Dispute form itself?

7. **Understand Navigation & Accessibility** How easy is it for Veterans using screen readers to navigate through the pages from intro pages to Digital Dispute form?



## Hypothesis

Note: Remember to constrain the hypothesis to the goals of your study!

What do you intend to learn and measure from this study?
What do you already know about this problem space?
What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don’t skip this step!)
Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study.

----------

**We hypothesize that:**

1. Veterans (users in this study) may struggle to find the new “Options to request help with VA debt” R&S page (“Wizard”) and **may** have difficulty noticing the difference between this new page and other help/intro pages such as: Manage VA Debt page and FSR intro page
2. Veterans will find the information on the 3 help/intro pages (Manage VA Debt page and FSR intro page) including the R&S page to be helpful
3. Veterans will be able to find the Digital Dispute form easily so long as they are able to find the R&S page
4. Veterans will view the experience of introductory pages to Digital Dispute form as part of one experience
5. Veterans will be able to understand the Digital Dispute Form easily and without significant cognitive load demands
6. Veterans will be able to navigate through the Digital Dispute Form easily 
7. Veterans (users in this study) may find an option to resolve or address their debt on the “Options to request help with VA debt” R&S page (“Wizard”) that is relevant to them and it may take them time to understand and find the option that is most relevant to them

  

----------

## Methodology 🛠️

### Usability study

***Primary focus:*** on navigation, wayfinding, mental models

***Secondary focus:*** comprehension and mental models

### Location


-   Remote only



## Research materials 📔

Note

Your OCTO/VA lead must review and approve all research materials – including this plan – prior to submitting a recruitment request.

Provide a link to any materials you need to run your study, including any materials needed for set up and recruitment.

  

For moderated usability tests:

-   [Link to conversation guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oHGMLj5kTWYpbnnYuWJH_9e234vXKhRCC8z9aQ6nZuM/edit?tab=t.0)
    
-   [Link to prototype](https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt)
    

## Recruitment 🎯

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers.

Note

Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources:

-   [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recruiting-participants) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research.
    
-   [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.
    

### Recruitment approach

Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them?

Note

-   Perigean CANNOT recruit VA employees or VSOs. Work with your VA lead to recruit these groups.
    
-   Perigean can also support remote, [unmoderated studies](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/perigean-recruiting-process-for-unmoderated-studie), however, these studies require strict recruitment requirements.
    
-   Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.
    

  

### We will have 2 cohorts: (1) Veterans with VBA debt (2) AT sessions

## Demographic must-haves for

### Wizard > Digital Dispute (overpayments)

### COHORT 1 total N = 8 (minimum)

 Veterans that have VBA overpayments (most desirable for study) N = 6 (minimum) 

### COHORT 2 (Veterans that use AT) total N = 2 (minimum)



## Recruitment criteria

Note

-   Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants.
    
-   Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question. Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]
    

Tip

-   The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria.
    
-   Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria.
    
-   Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Review an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/pre-mhv-prototype/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md)
    

List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study:

  


-   Veterans: [10] - please recruit 20 Veterans
    
-   Caregivers: [0]
    
-   Dependents: [0]
    
-   Total: [10]
    


 -   #### All participants must be Veterans
 -   #### All participants must have had an experience of a VBA overpayment debt in the last 3 years (resolved or not resolved is ok)
-    #### Inclusive, diverse sample with respect to race/ethnicity, age, gender, educational attainment, financial status    
 -   #### All must be on a computer or mobile device.
 -   #### During the session, be willing to share a web browser window on their device
 -   #### Have a working microphone on their device
 -   #### Have Zoom downloaded to their device prior to the session and know how to share their screen
    
 -  **50%** of participants should complete the session on a **smartphone**.
    
 - **50%** of participants should complete the session on a **desktop computer**.

- Mix of income levels
- Most participants must say they are currently experiencing financial hardship or have in the past. 
- While the Digital Dispute asks for financial information, we won't be asking our participants to provide exact financial information. However, we want to simulate a real experience as much as we can to ensure the experience is intuitive for Veterans. 
**Please confirm participants are comfortable talking about their finances.**


Demographic must-haves

Note: The following demographic criteria is our goal, but we understand that historically it's been challenging to recruit participants with VA debt.

-   At least 4 of 10 people must identify as Black, Hispanic/Latina/Latinx, or Native American
    
-   At least 4 of 10 people must identify as having a cognitive consideration
    
-   At least 5 of 10 people must identify as other than male
    
-   At least 2 of 10 people are without a degree or professional certificate
    
-   At least 2 of 10 people are under 35
    
-   At least 4 of 10 people are over 55
    
-   At least 3 of 10 people who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender
    

#### Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)

-   At least 1 of 10 people who live in a rural or remote area
    
-   At least 1 of 10 people who live in a major metropolitan area

Inclusive research strategy
   
  
### Screener for COHORT 1

**1. VA debt**
 
*Please select what applies to you (Check all that apply)* 
 
 - I currently have a fully unpaid or partially unpaid VA benefits overpayment debt 
(disability compensation, education or pension benefits overpayments)

- I had a VA benefits overpayment debt in the last 3 years (disability compensation, 
education or pension benefits overpayments) and it has been fully repaid

- I have not had a VA benefits overpayment debt in the last 3 years (does not 
qualify) 
 
**2. Amount of debt**
 
*Please select the amount of the debt for the highest VA debt you have had in 
the last 3 years* 

 • The debt I had or currently have is in the range of $1 - $99 
 
 • The debt I had or currently have is in the range of $100 - $500 
 
 • The debt I had or currently have is in the range of $501 - $1,000 
 
 • The debt I had or currently have is over $1,000 

 
**3. What is your perspective on this VA debt**
 
What is your perspective on this VA benefits overpayment debt?  
 
*Please select what applies to you (Check all that apply)* 

•  I don’t think I owe this debt to VA 

•  I don’t think the amount is correct on this debt 

•  I can’t afford this debt 

•  None of these apply to me 

•  Decline to answer this question 
 
**4. Experiences of financial hardship**

*Please select the statement(s) that apply to you: (Check all that apply)* 
  
• I am currently experiencing financial hardship. 

• I have experienced financial hardship in the past. 

• I have never experienced financial hardship.   
 
**5. LGBTQ+**

*Do you identify as a member of the LGBTQ+ community?*

We ask this question because we want to make sure the feedback we get from these 
sessions represents all the people we serve. 
 
•  Yes 

•  No 

•  Decline to answer 
  
**6. Cognitive consideration**

*Has a medical professional ever diagnosed you with a cognitive disorder?* 

Some examples include PTSD, Alzheimer's disease, Attention deficit disorder, Dementia, Parkinson's disease, 
Traumatic brain injury 
 
•  Yes 

•  No 

•  Decline to answer 
  
**7. What is your annual household income level?**


**For reviewers understanding only (please do not include in recruitment screener) - why we ask this:** 
This criteria is essential because it is a primary indicator of financial wellbeing and a possible indicator of financial hardship and/or poverty. We want to speak to Veterans in a range of financial situations, from high financial need to low financial need, because it is our hope that the debt portal can be accessed and the resources understood and acted upon regardless of financial situation. Stress and financial stress can affect comprehension, and understanding comprehension is a primary goal of this study. Combined with question 4, this also gives us a good indication as to what situation a Veteran might be in for the purpose of diverse recruitment and for preparation before interviews. 
 
• $0 - $25K 

• $25K - 49.9K 

• $50K - 74.9K 

• $75K - 99.9K 

• $100K - 149.9K 

• $150K - $199.9K

## Timeline 🗓️

Note

Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.

Desired start date for study: 

Wednesday, May 14th 2025 - Wednesday, May 21st 2025

### Prepare

When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session.

### Availability

When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time.

Note

We recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.

Tip

Please request enough dates and at least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants. (e.g. 3/17, Monday 9:00AM-1:00PM, 3:00PM-6:00PM EST; 3/18, Tuesday 9:00AM-6:00PM EST, etc.; 12 time slots for 6 participants). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.

Place time slots between hash marks when in edit mode.
