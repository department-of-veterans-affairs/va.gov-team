I'm trying to remove an erroneous debt. I received no feedback from the Veterans administration concerning any help whatsover with removing the debt. There is no information to contact a live person to discuss matters.

Update phone number. The only phone number I have is a Japanese number. This site forces me to put in a wrong phone number, just to proceed for claims or disputes.

I got a link in my email, and now I'm taking to "Dispute Charges". I don't even know what I was charged for!

Dispute an overpayment online.  The form has been unavailable all day.  The letter from the VA states that an online dispute is the fatest.  It is very inconvenient that this option is not available especially since there are time limits involved in making a dispute.

I do not owe any money to VA.  All bills are paid by VA.    I haven't had to pay because of financial situation of not enough income.  Please take care of this
