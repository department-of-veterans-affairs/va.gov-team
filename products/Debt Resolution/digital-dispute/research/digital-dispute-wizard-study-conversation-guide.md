# Conversation Guide for Financial Management Team, R/S Page & Digital Dispute , May 2025

## Getting to know you (10 minutes)  

Hello/Welcome

 
Thank you so much for your time today. My name is Charlotte and I work at VA.gov - itâ€™s nice to meet you!

  

How are you today?

  

I work at VA.gov to help improve access to benefits and services for Veterans like you. This work is meaningful to me because I believe that those who have served have a right to these services and benefits. [meaning]

  

Youâ€™ll notice there are a few people on the call already. Theyâ€™re my colleagues and theyâ€™re here to listen and to learn. Is that ok with you? [permission]

  

My goal today is to learn how easy or difficult it is to use a digital portal we are working on to help you understand how to pay or get help with VA overpayment debts.

  

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

  

Next, I want to explain my role better.

  

I am a consultant for the VA and my role is to talk to Veterans like you to understand the challenges you face in the space of VA overpayment debt. I am gathering information to help improve the experience of addressing or resolving your VA overpayment debt. 

  

The limits of my role are that I am not the final decision maker on the experience nor am I a financial expert, but I can surface issues and challenges that come up in research to the VA.

  

Your comfort and wellbeing are very important to us.

  

Sensitive topics might come up, and if at any point you want to take a break, please let me know. If you want or need to stop the interview at any point, just let me know. [comfort and consent]

  

Your identity will be kept confidential, and any information we take away from the interview will be stored securely. [confidentiality]

  

I'm going to ask if you are comfortable recordingt his interview - we use recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

  

Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.

 

***Optional***:

 Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteransâ€™ experiences?

  

One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your on screen image.

  

[Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA.]

  

At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.

  

Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?

  

Do you have any questions for me?

  

I want to make sure the next 60 minutes are still good for you today?

  

### START INTERVIEW

## Warm-up

### [Rapport building]

-  We like to start off with a lighthearted question to get to know you better.
    
-   Whatâ€™s something you enjoy doing these daysâ€”any hobbies or routines? OR What's your favorite thing about Spring?
    

- Thank you for sharing! (personalize response)

  

### â€” Begin usability study â€”

### Baseline [5 minutes]

  

-   Can you briefly tell me what has been your most recent experience with VA overpayment debt and when it appeared? [establish baseline]
    
-   What, if any, actions have you taken to understand or resolve this debt?
    
-   In 1-3 words, what words would you use to describe the process of understanding and resolving your debt in your experience so far?


### Prototype (5 minutes)

Letâ€™s go to the next part of the interview where we are going to share a digital experience weâ€™re working on and ask for your feedback. A few things I want you to know:

You'll be interacting with a prototype that may not work exactly the way you expect. 
Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. 
This is very important to know: since it's a demo, we have used fake, prefilled information, and none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
In this task, we would like to hear your honest feedback. 
Please comment on what is clear and unclear.

I am going to drop a link in the Zoom chat. When you receive the link, please open the page.
