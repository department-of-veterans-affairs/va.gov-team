## Overview
*After you've explored the problem and through testing / hypothesis have identified the ideal solution, write up one sentence describing the solution you'll be creating.*

## Problem Statement
VA is working to implement a new enterprise-wide Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) tool - Saviynt Enterprise Identity Cloud - for its workforce of employees and contractors. While the tool is FedRAMP-authorized, it must still obtain VA Authority to Operate (ATO) before it can be used in production. Currently, the VA lacks a standardized, enterprise-level IGA system, relying instead on fragmented and often manual legacy processes that are inefficient, error-prone, and difficult to scale. The challenge spans across the VA’s complex IT environment, where legacy and modern systems coexist and will need to be integrated and eventually replaced.

How might we enable a smooth, secure, and scalable transition to a centralized identity governance system that supports timely access, accountability, and modernization across a vast and complex VA ecosystem?
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- As an Admin, I want to quickly and easily grant a user access based on their roles so that they are not blocked from doing the work they need to do and cause unnecessary delays for finance or acquisition-related tasks.
- As an Admin, I want to quickly and easily modify a user’s account access so that the user can support a second organization they have been assigned to.
- As an Admin, I want to be able to quickly and easily provision users so that their time to onboard and spent waiting decreases.
- As an Admin, I want to be able to quickly and easily deprovision users so that VA assets and systems remain secure, even after an employee moves roles or leaves.
- As a user, I can easily request access modifications, and low-risk modifications can be automatically approved.

## Undesired User Outcomes


## Desired Business Outcomes

- Obtain and maintain the ATO for the IGA-tool to ensure that it remains compliant with VA security requirements and best practices.
- Delivery and maintenance of the product strategy and roadmap for IGA modernization.
- Delivery of the transition roadmap from legacy IGA services and integrations to the modern solution.
- Implement the enterprise IGA solution and integrate it with other VA systems to improve productivity, efficiency, and security.
- Launch the IGA tool into production in a phased rollout to enable successful adoption of users that improves their user experience.
- Enable automation and automated workflows wherever possible to improve the user experience.
- Provide cost savings to the VA through reduction in the maintenance required for legacy systems that can be replaced by IGA functionality.
- Establish an enterprise-wide, cloud-based IGA platform that enables identity lifecycle management as well as other critical features for VA modernization.
- Through research, ensure all IGA solution experiences are consistent with the broader experience goals and strategy across ICAM

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Over scoping initial deployment
- Failing to identify all authoritative sources and perform data analyses on them
- Incomplete identity data mapping for each use case
- Skipping environmental cleanup efforts
- Rushing a rollout at the cost of poor data quality, data loss, and/or integration
- Poor communication between our partner teams, stakeholders, and vendors
- Focusing on large, single milestones instead of incremental progress
- Failing to plan and execute the transition of legacy systems replaced by IGA
- Security breaches
- Significant UX pain points inconsistent with broader ICAM Experience goals

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_
* _**Limit 5-6 KPIs per product**__

| Category | Ease of use | Service completion | Trust/Satisfaction | Health |
|----------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics. These may come from other systems other than VA.gov e.g. eBenefits._

### Objectives and Key results (OKRs)

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

### Initiatives
*Include initiatives (iterations, new features, etc.) to improve this product. See the [Initiative Brief Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/product/initiative-brief-template.md)*
