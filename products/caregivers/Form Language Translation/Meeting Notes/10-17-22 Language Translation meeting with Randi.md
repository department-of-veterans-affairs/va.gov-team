## 10/17/2022 Language Translation discussion

Spoke with Randi Hecht, who gave us some basic information on how the process works to have a document/form translated
- Would recommend to translate just to Spanish for now, if we do the whole form (haven't done a form before!)
     - Let's get the new process established first, see how it goes
- Tagalog or Chinese might be next
- [Landing page](https://staging.va.gov/family-member-benefits/comprehensive-assistance-for-family-caregivers/) (static) with link to online form would be translated first (this is not our instructions/Introduction page).
     - Form can be translated in staging
     - Translators need context (Content/Danielle reviews to ensure ready for translation)
          - The translators are provided a Word doc, with additional context
          - They are also provided the JSON file with user name & PW to walk thru the form in staging
     - They would do a QA on the staging form
     - There is a team of Spanish translators, but only one Tagalog translator
     - They haven't done a form for us yet, would be interesting
     - Must keep changes in sync with English form!!
- Timeline considerations
     - Currently working on 3 static benefit pages, translation will take about 3 weeks
     - Translation on this lengthy form could take a couple months
- In other news, some Global components were sent for translation and are being worked on
     - These may be available when we are ready to start this process, meaning that some of the components we use may already have translations

Lisaâ€™s question
- If someone wants to see the form in another language, how would they access it?
     - On VA, there are separate tabs for other languages
     - In Search, it is a separate URL
     - With forms, probably a link to access a separate form with a separate URL
