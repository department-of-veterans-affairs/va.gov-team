# Design Weekly Sync Agenda

## 2023-10-16

Attendees: Jessica, Katelyn, Hieu, Kristen


- Talked about EZ intro page for those who are already enrolled and the adjustments needed once the EZR goes live
  - Next steps: 
  - Consider changes to the content around updates to benefits, the two headline sections could be combined
  - Look at both primary and secondary action links in the design system
  - Consider the only call to action on the page to be the "update benefit" button.

- Talked about the Registration updates late last week and how to re-approach the problem
  - Next steps:
  - Working sessions for research questions and research goals
  - Once those are refined; begin thinking through research methods/logistics

## 2023-10-11

Attendees: Jessica, Katelyn, Hieu, Kristen


- Reviewed Registration Flow Exploration and Matrix comparrison work and discussed the pros/cons/differences between each of these
- Also talked about variations of the flows and what would make sense MVP term and ideal state, what mvp could build up/set the foundation for the ideal state
- Decided on a flow variation where on the intro page there is a Veteran and non-Veteran split/ action links, followed by a prioritization wizard.
  - Followed by a prioritization wizard
  - Consider the short-form as part of the MVP
- The business logic (unauthenticated) flow is the backup.
- Next steps to create wireflow of mvp direction and share back with team


## 2023-10-02

Attendees: DK, Katelyn, Jessica, Kristen

- EZR - insurance section to match ez regarding headlines (h3-ish). We won't introduce new field set legends for mvp.
- EZR Research Planning - started talking about research goals and who to recruit. Looking towards 2 cohorts with different disability ratings, those over 50% and those under 10%. Talked about starting the convo guide at VA.gov and not on the form intro page so we can learn more about the wayfinding side of it and if there is confusion between the static and intro pages
- Registration Research Synthesis - went over Mural board and first draft of key findings; going to add in more details and examples around some of the findings like the learning curve, burden of proof and the benefits overlap from the Veteran's perspective. More chats to come on recommendations and next steps

Attendees: DK, Katelyn, Jessica, Hieu, Kristen

A few quick notes from the session, which was mostly about the EZR work:

- Decision: Show statuses on first page and every section.
- Need to check with engineers about save data to PDF form.
- In aggreenent to ditch the stepper if possible.
- [Post MVP Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1693945362104/f2d83704cf9de28206d5cb28e1b188a3f87b96e9?sender=ubf5503bf47b6eb1e92730053) to track future enhancements.

## 2023-08-21

Attendees: DK, Katelyn, Hieu, Kristen, Alex

A few quick notes from the session, which was mostly about the EZR work:

- We probably don't need the stepper on the form intro page. Check with Matt L. on nixing it.
- Work on next appointment language could be helpful. Check with that team.
- Check on application vs. form language with content.
- What happens when people with account go into form, but aren't enrolled and can't apply? We need an alert for this.
- Need a ticket for error messages. Look at the EZ for inspiration here.

## 2023-08-14

Attendees: DK, Katelyn, Hieu, Kristen, Emily, Alex

**EZR form wireframe**: Hieu

- Jessica's feedback in Sketch all straight forward and had no main questions or challenges.
- DK's feedback around one thing per page: Can we still combine fields that can't be changed? DK: Yes, it was a concern and possible feedback that Collab Cycle folks might have. But it can still be explored.
- Kristen to review the wireframes this week.

**Research synthesis**: Katelyn

- Katelyn to carve out slides/sections she wants to work on in HEC deck and Mural.
- Katelyn to make a working session for today to team can collaborate on synthesis more.

## 2023-08-07

Attendees:

**Research sync on current research + synthesis**: All

- Research is showing Profile would be the best location for EZR info. We'll need to have the conversation with PRA folks. Alex to set up a meeting with them, Kristen and Patrick when Patrick is back from vacation.
- One middle ground might be to link to a separate EZR form from the Profile, if we have to walk in both worlds of a separate form and putting it in a location where Veterans want it. Still working both angles: Profile and separate form flow.
- Designers will meet to walk through submitting for Household study.

**EZR wireframe**: Hieu

- Showed spreadsheet with field comparison. Will work on wireframe of separate form flow next.
- Look at Pre-checkin for confirm flow.
- Could be a technical limitation because of Check-in confirm flow not being in forms library. Chat with engineers about the possibilities there.

## 2023-08-01

Attendees:  DK, Jessica, Katelyn, Hieu, Kristen, Heather, Alex, Fletcher

**Research organization and planning**

Prototype study: Could tackle the PRA stuff if it's strongly Profile direction. If not, back to the drawing board.
Mobile app is looking into Priority Groups. Touch base with them on research.

- Add in video check at end.
- Priority Group: Didn't know. Could we relate to disbility rating.
- Disability rating and financial ratings: How to this interplay? How is it used by other benefits? Maybe check out financial hardship form.
- Deadline remains the same for EZR whether it's a form or in Profile.

**Registration only study feedback** 

- Leave the priority group questions in this research.
- Good idea to show print version of the current state form.
- Ask about changes to ideal state after seeing the print form or an example.
- Cohort 1: Does warmup question make sense for folks who didn't enroll? Maybe it's around care? Delete for question, but keep second one.
- Third topic, first question: Break this question up some.
- Cohort 2: Warmup, maybe follow up on what kind of activities they do.
- First topic: Maybe too many questions for 10 minutes?

**Household study**

- Overlap. Will we need to get the prototype ready?
- Go lighter on Household section.
- Focus on one thing vs. all three studies.

## 2023-07-24

Attendees:  DK, Jessica, Katelyn, Kristen, Heather

**Research organization and planning**

We talked through logistics for our upcoming studies. The goal is to have a primary lead for each research activity and a backup. Two people would take each study.

- Katelyn to lead synthesis on FD
- Hieu to lead prototype next steps
- Hieu/DK to take planning on prototype research
- Jessica/DK on Household study
- Registration-only: Jessica/Katelyn to take lead
- Katelyn in Hawaii for Labor Day
- Sign up for mod. sessions.

[Full planning available in the research planning Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1686254946051/07405f6e988a0541dc0983cc5e286ba6fe612cf8?wid=189-1652380184686).



**Registration-only stuff**

- Same disclosure depending on registration-only flow? Not different for paper form. Still have to agree.
- Still some questions around the priority of the flows.
- Kristen/Patrick: Where should it be in the C&P process?
- This is early work so more coming.

**Memorable date component**

- Version 3 has month picker by name vs. date number. Maybe easier cognitively. Hasn't been tested by Veterans.
- How many date fields on EZ? Three/four or more. CG is a better testing ground.
- Maybe tradeoffs for each one would be better to see it all.
- Katelyn to make a list of tradeoffs for each path and share.

## 2023-07-17

Attendees:  DK, Jessica, Hieu, Katelyn, Kristen

**EZR Research**

- Jessica with where we're at in getting research scheduled.

Action items:

- Send note to Robyn for research heads up. Waiting for AE feedback.

**HEC presentation for EZR work**

- DK to run through rough slides/presentation.

Action items:

- Add questions to slide deck.
- Ask about process in design

**Date Input vs. Memorable Date**

- Katelyn to review desk research on these components and lead discussion with designers about direction

Action items:

- Ask about forms design system and memorable date component
- Ask about launch date for component in design system
- Look into accessibility research

## 2023-07-10

Attendees: DK, Jessica, Hieu, Alex

**EZR related wireframes and meeting prep (Hieu)**

- We mostly talked through a strategy of how to pitch the EZR-related work in the Profile area of VA.gov.

**EZR related research (Jessica)**

- This mostly feels like it's in good shape after Jessica talked through it. No major feedback or changes.

## 2023-06-26

Attendees: DK, Jessica, Hieu, Katelyn, Kristen

**EZR discovery ticket (Hieu)**

- [Discovery for Veteran Information Editing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/58542): This ticket feels too big since scope changed. Let's take that back to Heather and Alex and see what we can do with it.
- We still need to do some sythesis on the Pittsburgh and Martinsburg research calls.

**Priority Group/Financial Info research (Jessica)**

Some big takeaways from this discussion:

- Let's do some more desk research to see what other teams have insight that can help with our current research efforts. Jessica has [notes in her Mural board](https://app.mural.co/invitation/mural/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1687381992402?sender=u773b824999f25f58b8e77486&key=2694912f-19c7-4254-8e86-ce74e6a4bdf0).

- Things to consider for Priority Group: unclear on what type of information can be shared with the Veterans. What is the tradeoff to showing that information? Should we be showing the overview definitions or the individualized PG?

## 2023-06-19

Attendees: DK, Jessica, Hieu, Katelyn, Kristen

**Progress bar/stepper (Hieu)**

Questions:

- What does our research say about the bar/stepper? Is it needed?
- Does this component still solve a problem Veteran has?
- What's the opportunity to interact with it? Maybe it becomes navigation in the future?

**CG business feedback (Katelyn)**

- Talked through a few potential copy changes. Katelyn to share those with content folks ahead of time off.

**Pittsburgh research call review (all)**

- Follow up on benefits packet to see the content.
- Cover roles in future call. Follow up on past call.
- Watch magic wand scenios for thoughts on tension between HEC center and employees at centers.

**Action items**

- Hieu to connect with forms design team and explore different options.

## 2023-06-12

Attendees: DK, Jessica, Hieu, Katelyn, Kristen, Alex

**VA 1010EZ Staff Research Questions**

We brainstormed questions for interviewing staff, done in these two Mural boards:

- [EZR discovery](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1684943221068/4b11f2d1902d05f12f53468263a561c2d5a460a9?wid=0-1684949791097)
- [EZ Registration-only path discovery](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1684348883203/49fc4ff1bf31f3cabe200663708c1002645b447f?wid=0-1686000958778)

## 2023-06-05

Attendees: DK, Jessica, Hieu, Katelyn, Kristen

**Registration-only (Jessica)**

- Jessica has a board with questions to answer via research.
- We talked through early reseach questions and what we're still missing as far as questions.

**EZR (Hieu)**

- Hieu walked us through the EZR Mural board and process flows he's created.
- We decided he's in a good place until we dig up more information through the scheduled meetings Alex is working on.

## 2023-05-29

- No meeting (holiday)

## 2023-05-22

Attendees: DK, Jessica, Hieu, Katelyn, Kristen

**Introduction**

Kristen McConnell introduced herself as part of OCTO, works with Patrick Bateman, and will be in all of the syncs. She is part of the health team, the design and research lead, and the appointment lead. She wants to encourage the team to think very broadly, beyond the scope of one project.

**Registration only path**
- Jessica showed off her early discovery efforts on the registration only path. It's early still and there are a lot of unanswered questions.
- Kristen: Think broadly with this research. Maybe onsite research? What setups in E&E offices would you need? We can provide a list of requirements for the sites.
- Kristen: Do we need triggers on other pages? What are the access points and should they be more strategic?


**Designer skills**

We came up with this rough list during the meeting:

Visual design
Interaction design
Discovery work
Research
  - Planning
  - Analyzing
  - Running it
Content
  - Plain language
  - Microcopy

Attendees: DK, Jessica, Hieu


**Headline and Radio label design discovery**
- Hieu walked through two examples for both radio buttons and h3s on the 1010EZ.
- Broadly, the group felt like the explorations would improve things for Veterans, but only incrementally. It avoids the real challenge, making the questions h1 elements and deemphasizing the progress bar.


**Misc Item (Tabled items; if time chat about next meeting)**
- Any onboarding related questions?
- Designer interests and experiences list
- Content process ideas
- Source of truth - what lives where - Sketch, Mural, Github

### Action items

- Hieu to update ticket and recommend we work on the bigger problem instead: h1 and progress bar.
- The team should think through how it can contribute to that work broadly.

## 2023-05-08

Attendees: DK, Jessica, Katelyn, Hieu, Matt K.

**Katelyn showing designs for an improved primary/secondary caregiver clarification experience.**

- Experimented with different versions of a table, featuring primary/secondary caregiver differences. Great for scanning. Could be a challenge on mobile. Check color contrast and design system contraints/experiemental patterns for table visual treatments. 
- Started with DK's copy, and it feels like a lot of copy no matter how you arrange it or what components you use.
- Introduction page updates so it uses design system intro patter/progress component
- Additional info component feels like a crutch here. Also, modals won't work well either. Maybe this is a good reason to explore altering the flow?

### Action items

- Katelyn to do some work on a next round of designs and bring it to our next meeting.
