# Current questions for the CARMA team regarding the 10-10CG form


1. The most critical function of our online form will be to send the form data to the CARMA system through an API call and
have that data saved on the CARMA end, is that API endpoint currently set up and what is the required authentication as well
as required parameters or payload? If this API endpoint does not exist how long would it take to set it up?


2. We will need an API endpoint so that we can retrieve the status of a current caregiver application from the CARMA
system, is that endpoint currently set up and what is the required authentication as well as required parameters or payload?
If this API endpoint does not exist how long would it take to set it up?

3. The form 10-10CG requires 4 seperate users to fill it out. These seperate users may need to be treated as one "group"
for the purposes of each individual user being able to view the status of a single application. Is this currently
possible within the CARMA system and if so how does this work? If not how long would it take to set this up?
