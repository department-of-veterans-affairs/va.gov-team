## The Problem

Currently in order to apply as a veteran caregiver you must fill out a paper application. Then that application is sent to the
VA and the data is entered into a system called CARMA by a person. This process creates a bottleneck as well as is high
cost and low efficiency.

## The Proposed Solution

We are building a new application experience for VA Caregivers that will be more modern and efficient way to apply as a 
caregiver online. This new experience will also be lower in cost as it will be online and thus largely automated.

## The Font-End Scope

So what does this mean for the front-end engineer? We need to answer a rather large set of questions that basically
break down into a few categories -

1. What are the required features of this new online experience?
2. What environment will this new online experience live on and what are the technical remifications of that environment?
3. What existing font-end components can be re-used for this new online experience?
4. What, if any, front-end components will need to be created for this new online experience?
5. How will the front end be affected by any need to interface with the existing CARMA system?
