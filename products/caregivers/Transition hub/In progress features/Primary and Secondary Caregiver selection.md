## Feature background
User story: As a Veteran and Caregiver/s applying for PCAFC, I want to be clear about the difference between a Primary and Secondary Caregiver. I want to know if there are different requirements and what benefits each one receives in order to apply for the correct one.



## UX research 
Unrelated usability research studies have shown that users are unclear the difference between a Primary and Secondary Caregiver. A big reason for this is that the selection to apply for each of these is separated in the flow. Another reason is that people don't know what the difference between Primary and Secondary is- if there are different requirements (there aren't) and what benefits are different.
