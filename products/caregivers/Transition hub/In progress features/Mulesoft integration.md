## Feature background
VA.gov used to interface directly with
CARMA (Salesforce) for 10-10CG form submissions and document uploads. The problems that seeded the need for the Mulesoft Proxy were:
- Salesforce latency (gateway timeouts)
- Salesforce API (breaking) changes

The solution was to place the Mulesoft Proxy in between VA.gov and Salesforce so that Mulesoft could:
- manage API updates between itslef and Salesforce, taking the burden off the VA
- asynchronously queue requests and provide a faster response to the VA frontend

User story: As a va.gov user I would like to know when my online 10-10CG has been successful so I don't resubmit duplicates.
