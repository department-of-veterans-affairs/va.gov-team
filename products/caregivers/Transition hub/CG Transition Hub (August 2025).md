**Updated June 24, 2025**

**Note:** These Transition Docs are "point in time" documents, and may not reflect current progress, deployments or upcoming efforts beyond the last update date.
>**Team transition document**
>The purpose of this transition document is to outline the state of 10-10CG product development. It serves as a "front door" to documentation and resources collected during the course of product design and development. Included are links to more specific "feature transition hubs" where you can find direct links to resources and references used during design and development.
>
>**Note:** The 10-10EZ health care application management was under the purview of the 10-10 Health Apps team. You may find some intermixed documentation; however, this hub focuses solely on the 10-10CG.  If you're looking for information about the 10-10CG (Caregiver application) or the 10-10EZ Veteran Health care application, please refer to their dedicated transition documents.

## **Product context**
**Team Vision:** An effortless online experience that allows Veterans and their Caregivers to easily apply for, track, and update Family Caregiver information. The MVP of the online 10-10CG was released in October of 2020 as an unauthenticated experience. We continue to iterate in order to improve the experience of applying for The Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers.
* Used by Veterans and Caregivers of disabled Veterans to apply for Caregiver benefits from the VA.
* Caregiver benefits are services, support and education for Caregivers, so they can provide better care to their Veterans.
* Unauthenticated experience only at this time.
* Approximately 6,500 submissions per month.

## **Roadmap**

This roadmap reflects current priorities and efforts for the 10-10CG application as of June 2025, based on the latest priority list.

**Now (Active/Launched Initiatives):**
* **Facilities Search:** Launched 2/14, improved facility search & selection.
* **Submission Failure Email:** Launched 2/21, provides notifications for failed submissions.
* **OAuth 2.0:** Launched 4/2, enhancing security and app authentication.
* **Signature Page Update:** Launched 7/15, prefills names in signature fields on Review page

**Next (Planned / In Progress Discovery):**
* **Caregiver Clarification:** Content refresh is in progress to improve clarity around caregiver roles and definitions. This likely aligns with previous "Primary/Secondary Caregiver selection" work.
* **Integrate with Mobile app:** Ongoing exploration for possible integration with the VA mobile application, and whether this integration would be beneficial.
