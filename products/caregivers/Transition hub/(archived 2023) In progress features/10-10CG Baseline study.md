## Feature background
In order to get a better, and more recent, idea of the current efficacy of the 10-10CG form, we will be performing a baseline study with users. This will give us a better picture of which sections of the application are in need of attention so that we can focus our time and efforts to ensure that we're addressing the biggest problems first.



## UX research 
Baseline study will be end-to-end moderated research sessions with Veterans.  Not currently scheduled, looking to target February.
