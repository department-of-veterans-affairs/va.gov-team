## Feature background
The stakeholders want to have the online 10-10CG form translated in Spanish and Tagalog.  There are no forms that are translated on VA.gov.  The Check-in Experience is the first team to have a process translated.

Stakeholder meeting notes 10/14/2022
>Additional languages for intro of CG
>- Can CSP support other languages? (communications)
>- Prob need to do the whole form (not just intro)
>     - **Matt B** mentioned that the instructions would be quicker to update 
>     - **Patrick** - when we do translations, we do the whole form with instructions.
>          - Is it worth doing instructions only (customer experience)?
>          - Does OMB have issue with forms in other languages, or does it need to be reviewed again, like any other changes?
>- **Patrick** confirmed:
>     - re: OMB PRA review of translated forms.
>     - From OIRA desk officers for VA:As long as we're just translating and not introducing new, substantive changes to the content, we can just submit the translated >version through the OIRA system. They can do a non-substantive review and can usually review within 1 to 2 days.
