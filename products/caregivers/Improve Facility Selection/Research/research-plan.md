# [DRAFT] Research Plan: 10-10CG facility selection study, 1010 Team, February 2023


## Background

- [Caregivers Product Outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/10-10CG%20Caregiver%20application%20product-outline.md)
- [Initiative Outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/Improve%20Facility%20Selection/Improve%20Facility%20Selection%20-%20Initiative%20Brief.md)

This research is to be conducted on the application for Family Caregiver Benefits (10-10CG) by the 1010 team.

During previous usability studies on this form (research findings: [February 2021](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/1010cg-mvp/Usability%20Study-Sign%20as%20Representative-%20February%202021/research-findings.md), [April 2021](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/1010cg-mvp/Sign-as-Rep-Round2-Usability-April%202021/research%20findings.md)) we have found the VA medical facility selection page caused many users confusion. A few trends include:
1. Users are confused why the facility they are familiar with isn't listed. (The current dropdown list only includes facilities with a Caregiver support staff and not all possible facilities.)
2. Users are uncertain which facility to specify (Eg. Primary care, therapist, oncologist, most recent, etc.)
3. Users that live on state borders potentially would have to select a different state from where they live in order to find their preferred facility (located in another state).

Additional technical and user experience concerns include:
1. The team wants to update and use an upcoming release of the facility API to manage the list of all community and VA locations and include search by zip code and city in additon to state.
2. By including both community and VA health care facilities in the search list, this could potentialy add confusion if the process is not made clear to the applicant. 
3. The question content needs to be in plain language as well as make the process clear as to how this answer will impact the caregiver and/or Veteran during their application process. 


### OCTO Objectives 

Which [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.
Increase:
- Percent of applications submitted online
- Completion rate of online transactions

Decrease:
- Time to successful complete and submit online transactions
- Time to process online applications


### Veteran Journey
Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)?
Are there moments that matter? 

- Taking care of myself
- Putting down roots
- Aging



## Research Goals	

The goals of this user research are to:

1. Determine if the facility question is easily understandable.
2. Determine if the confirmation page add clarity or confusion for the applicant to know how the information provided will be used during the caregiver application process.
3. Determine the accessibility of the facility search and selection process. 

### Outcome
The outcome of this study will help aid in decisions around changes to make to this question and and how it can help best minimize applications submitted with facility errors. 


### Research questions

**Goal 1: Understandable content**
- Is the new version of this question easy to understand and answer with little confusion?
- Does this new version result in clarifying questions or additional information needed to complete? 

**Goal 2: Clear how this is used in caregiver application process**
- Is the new version easy for the participant to understand why they are selecting a facility and how it impacts the caregiver application process?
- Does the confirmation screen after selection add any additional confusion or result in clarifying questions?


**Goal 3: Search and selection of facilities**
- Are users able to navigate through the facility selection without difficulty?
- Do they know what to input in the text search field?
- Can users easily use the search input and understand what choices are populated from that search?
- Is it clear how to reselect a facility if one is selected in error?
- How do screen reader participants respond to the confirmation pages?


### Hypothesis

Our hypothesis is that users will understand what they are selecting 



Our hypothesis is that users will be able to navigate through the facility selection relatively easily, but may have issues with the following:
- The amount of results shown
- Desire to filter results and how
- Not recognizing the name of the facility they are looking for
- Understanding the difference between community and VA facilities/Caregiver Support Facilities


## Methodology	

**User interviews and usability task analysis*

This will be a focused study on only the facility question(s) that is part of the caregiver application. The goal is to understand the usability impact to content, location search and selection, and confirmation messaging.  


### Location

A remote task-based usability study will be conducted remotely with Zoom using the Perigean contract.

## Recruitment	




### Recruitment approach





### Recruitment criteria

|Total requested|Completed sessions|Veterans|Family Member|Caregivers|Service Members|

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**


- At least 3 people over the age of 55
- At least 8 people who plan to use their mobile device for the session
- Participants must be able to use Zoom, locate and use the chat function in Zoom, and to share their screen through Zoom

- 

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**

Participant pool should in diverse in
- Branch of service
- Gender (30% or more women)
- Disability rating of 50% or higher representative of applicant demographics
- Education
- Race

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 



### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).



A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session.

* Date and time of pilot session: 


### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research:




### Length of sessions
* Session length: 30 minutes
* Buffer time between sessions: 30 minutes
* Maximum Sessions per day: 4
