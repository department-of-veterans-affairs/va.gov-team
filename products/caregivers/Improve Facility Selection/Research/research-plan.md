# [DRAFT] Research Plan: 10-10CG facility selection usability a/b/c study, 1010 Team, February 2023


## Background

- [Caregivers Product Outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/10-10CG%20Caregiver%20application%20product-outline.md)
- [Initiative Outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/Improve%20Facility%20Selection/Improve%20Facility%20Selection%20-%20Initiative%20Brief.md)

This research is to be conducted on the application for Family Caregiver Benefits (10-10CG) by the 1010 team.

During previous usability studies on this form (Research Findings: [February 2021](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/1010cg-mvp/Usability%20Study-Sign%20as%20Representative-%20February%202021/research-findings.md), [April 2021](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/1010cg-mvp/Sign-as-Rep-Round2-Usability-April%202021/research%20findings.md)) we have found the VA medical facility selection page caused many users confusion. A few trends in confusion include:
1. Users are confused why the facility they are familiar with isn't listed. (The current dropdown list only includes facilities with a Caregiver support staff and not all possible locations)
2. Users are uncertain which facility to specify (Eg. Primary care, therapist, oncologist, most recent, etc.)
3. Users that live on state borders potentially would have to select a different state from where they live in order to find their preferred facility (located in another state).

Additional techinal and user experience concerns include:
1. The team wants to update and use the facility API to manage the list of locations and include search by zip code in additon to state with a secondary filter by city.
2. By including both community and VA Health Care Facilities in the search list, this could potentialy add confusion if the process is not made clear to the applicant. 
3. The question content needs to be in plain language as well as make the process clear as to how this answer will impact the caregiver application process. 


We have created 3 updated facility question flows that focus on variations of content and process explanation while all using the same search functionalty. We are conducting a combination usability test / explorative research study to compare the variations of this question on clarity and understanding of this question. 


### OCTO Objectives 

Which [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.
Increase:
- Percent of applications submitted online
- Completion rate of online transactions

Decrease:
- Time to successful complete and submit online transactions
- Time to process online applications


### Veteran Journey
Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)?
Are there moments that matter? 

- Taking care of myself
- Putting down roots
- Aging



## Research Goals	

The goals of this user research are to:

1. Determine what facility question flow variation is the most understandable in the way it is asked.
2. Determine what variation makes it the most clear for the applicant to know how the information provided will be used during the caregiver application process.
3. Determine how applicants would prefer to search for and select a facility from a list.

### Outcome

The outcome of this study will help aid in decisions around changes to make to this question and and how it can help best minimize applications submitted with facility errors. 


### Research questions

**Goal 1: Understandable content**
- Which variation (a, b or c) is the easiest to understand and answer with little confusion?
- Which variation (a, b or c) results is the least amount of clarifying questions or additional information needed to complete? 


**Goal 2: Clear how this is used in caregiver application process**
- Which variation (a, b or c) is easiest to understand why they are selecting a facility and how it impacts the caregiver application process?
- Do users understand the variations (b and c) containing a confirmation screen after selection and does this add additional confusion?


**Goal 3: Search and selection of facilities**
- Are users able to navigate through the facility selection without difficulty?
- Do they know what to input in the text field?
- Can users easily use the search input and understand what choices are populated from that search?
- Can users easily narrow their search or pick a location from multiple pages of options?
- Is it clear how to reselect a facility if one is selected in error?



### Hypothesis

Our hypothesis is that users will understand 

Our hypothesis is that users will be able to navigate through the facility selection relatively easily, but may have issues with the following:
- The amount of results shown
- Filtering results by a filter they want
- Not recognizing the name of the facility they are looking for
- Understanding the difference between community and Caregiver support facilities




## Methodology	

**A/B/C usability task analysis and interview questions**

This will be a focused study on only the facility question(s) that is part of the caregiver application. The goal is to understand the usability impact to variations around question wording, location search and selection, and confirmation messaging.  



### Location

A remote task-based usability study will be conducted remotely with Zoom using the Perigean contract. 



### Research materials
- [Conversation Guide]()
- Designs: [Variation A](), [Variation B](), [Variation C]()
- Testing (TBD if coded prototypes or UXPin will be used]


## Recruitment	



### Recruitment approach
We would like to work with Perigean to recruit for 10 fulfilled remote sessions. Therefore, we request that 15 sessions be scheduled.


### Recruitment criteria
|Total requested|Completed sessions|Veterans|Family Member|Caregivers|Service Members|
|:-------------:|:----------------:|:------:|:-----------:|:--------:|:-------------:|
|      15       |            10    |6       |  2          |   7      |               | 


**Primary criteria (must-haves)**

- At least 4 people over the age of 55
- At least 8 people who plan to use their mobile device for the session
- Participants must be able to use Zoom, locate and use the chat function in Zoom, and to share their screen through Zoom


**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**

Participant pool should in diverse in
- Branch of service
- Gender (30% or more women)
- Disability rating of 50% or higher representative of applicant demographics
- Education
- Race
- Geography
- Density (rural)



## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 


### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research:



### Length of sessions
* Session length: 45 minutes
