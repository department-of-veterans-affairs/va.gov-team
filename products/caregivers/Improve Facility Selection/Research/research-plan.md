# [DRAFT] Research Plan: 10-10CG facility selection study, 1010 Team, February 2023


## Background

- [Caregivers Product Outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/10-10CG%20Caregiver%20application%20product-outline.md)
- [Initiative Outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/Improve%20Facility%20Selection/Improve%20Facility%20Selection%20-%20Initiative%20Brief.md)

This research is to be conducted on the application for Family Caregiver Benefits (10-10CG) by the 1010 team.

During previous usability studies on this form (research findings: [February 2021](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/1010cg-mvp/Usability%20Study-Sign%20as%20Representative-%20February%202021/research-findings.md), [April 2021](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/1010cg-mvp/Sign-as-Rep-Round2-Usability-April%202021/research%20findings.md)) we have found the VA medical facility selection page caused many users confusion. A few trends include:
1. Users are confused why the facility they are familiar with isn't listed. (The current dropdown list only includes facilities with a Caregiver support staff and not all possible facilities.)
2. Users are uncertain which facility to specify (Eg. Primary care, therapist, oncologist, most recent, etc.)
3. Users that live on state borders potentially would have to select a different state from where they live in order to find their preferred facility (located in another state).

Additional technical and user experience concerns include:
1. The team wants to update and use the facility API to manage the list of locations and include search by zip code and city in additon to state.
2. By including both community and VA health care facilities in the search list, this could potentialy add confusion if the process is not made clear to the applicant. 
3. The question content needs to be in plain language as well as make the process clear as to how this answer will impact the caregiver and/or Veteran during their application process. 


> DRAFT: We have created 3 updated facility question flows that focus on variations of content and process explanation while all using the same search functionalty. We are conducting a combination usability test / explorative research study to compare the variations of this question on clarity and understanding of this question. 


### OCTO Objectives 

Which [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.
Increase:
- Percent of applications submitted online
- Completion rate of online transactions

Decrease:
- Time to successful complete and submit online transactions
- Time to process online applications


### Veteran Journey
Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)?
Are there moments that matter? 

- Taking care of myself
- Putting down roots
- Aging



## Research Goals	

The goals of this user research are to:

1. Determine what facility question flow variation is the most understandable in the way it is asked.
2. Determine what variation makes it the most clear for the applicant to know how the information provided will be used during the caregiver application process.
3. Determine how applicants would prefer to search for and select a facility from a list.
4. Determine the accessibility of the facility search and selection process. 

### Outcome

The outcome of this study will help aid in decisions around changes to make to this question and and how it can help best minimize applications submitted with facility errors. 


### Research questions

**Goal 1: Understandable content**
- Which variation (a, b or c) is the easiest to understand and answer with little confusion?
- Which variation (a, b or c) results is the least amount of clarifying questions or additional information needed to complete? 


**Goal 2: Clear how this is used in caregiver application process**
- Which variation (a, b or c) is easiest to understand why they are selecting a facility and how it impacts the caregiver application process?
- Do users understand the variations (b and c) containing a confirmation screen after selection and does this add additional confusion?


**Goal 3: Search and selection of facilities**
- Are users able to navigate through the facility selection without difficulty?
- Do they know what to input in the text field?
- Can users easily use the search input and understand what choices are populated from that search?
- Can users easily narrow their search or pick a location from multiple pages of options?
- Is it clear how to reselect a facility if one is selected in error?
- 
**Goal 4: Determine the accessibility of the facility search and selection process.**
- Are users able to successfully search and select a location?
- How do screen reader participants respond to the confirmation pages?


### Hypothesis

Our hypothesis is that users will understand what they are selecting 



Our hypothesis is that users will be able to navigate through the facility selection relatively easily, but may have issues with the following:
- The amount of results shown
- Filtering results by a filter they want
- Not recognizing the name of the facility they are looking for
- Understanding the difference between community and Caregiver support facilities




## Methodology	

**User interviews and usability task analysis*

This will be a focused study on only the facility question(s) that is part of the caregiver application. The goal is to understand the usability impact to variations around question wording, location search and selection, and confirmation messaging.  

This will be a rolling study where we will do multiple studies and plan to iterate if needed to the prototypes/staging after completion and synthesis of cohort 1.

- **Cohort 1:** User interview, content focus only (20 completed sessions)
- **Cohort 2:** A/B usability task analysis (5 compelted sessions)
- **Cohort 3:** C/A usability task analysis (5 completed sessions)
- **Cohort 4:** B/C usability task analysis (5 completed sessions)


### Location

A remote task-based usability study will be conducted remotely with Zoom using the Perigean contract. 



### Research materials
- [Conversation Guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/Improve%20Facility%20Selection/Research/conversation-guide.md)
- Designs: [Variation A](), [Variation B](), [Variation C]()
- Testing (TBD if coded prototypes or UXPin will be used]
