# 10-10CG Facility Selection - Release Plan

- [Initiative Brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/Improve%20Facility%20Selection/Improve%20Facility%20Selection%20-%20Initiative%20Brief.md)
- [Epic](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/19433)

## Step 1: Development

You'll need to create a feature toggle (or two) for any moderately or significantly changing feature. Follow the [best practices for creating feature toggles](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/feature-toggles).

List the features toggles here.

| Toggle name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| caregiver_use_facilities_API | Allow list of caregiver facilites to be fetched by way of the Facilities API |

## Step 2: Validation

Before enabling your feature toggle in production, you'll need to:

- [ ] Follow [best practices for QA](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/qa-and-accessibility-testing).
- [ ] Have your team perform as much validation in staging as possible. Validation may be challenging for some teams and systems due to downstream requirements, but the staging system should mimic the production system as much as possible.
- [ ] Work any downstream or dependant systems proactively to ensure that the feature is ready for use once it hits production.
- [ ] Have a go/no go meeting with the team to ensure that the feature is ready for use and signed off by each discipline and your DEPO/OCTO contact. During this meeting, you'll need to:
  - [ ] review the plan with your DEPO/OCTO representative.
  - [ ] review the release plan with your team.

## Step 3: Production rollout
### Scope of the Facilty Selection feature
- The goal of this feature is to provide a dynamic search functionality for Veterans and Caregivers, so that they will have confidence in selecting the Veteran's preferred facility, which will also ensure the submitted application is routed to the appropriate Caregiver service facility for processing.

### Define the Rollback process

- The PM and Data Analyst will monitor analytics. If there is a spike in errors or unexpected behavior, the feature toggle will be disabled and issue triage will begin.

### Phase I: moderated production testing (also known as User Acceptance Testing, or UAT)

#### Planning

- Desired date range or test duration: [FILL_IN]
- Desired number of users: [FILL_IN]
- How you'll recruit the right production test users: [FILL_IN]
- How you'll conduct the testing: [FILL_IN]
- How you'll give the test users access to the product in production w/o making it live on VA.gov: [FILL_IN]

#### Results

- Number of users: [FILL_IN]
- Number of bugs identified / fixed: [FILL_IN]/[FILL_IN]
  - [FILL_IN] : list
  - [FILL_IN] : of
  - [FILL_IN]: Tickets of bugs/changes
- Was any downstream service affected by the change?: yes/no, [FILL_IN]
- Types of errors logged: [FILL_IN]
- Any changes necessary based on the logs, feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges? [PICK_ONE]: yes/no
- If yes, what: [FILL_IN] with ticket numbers

### Phase II: Staged Rollout (also known as unmoderated production testing)

We recommend that the rollout plan has five stages, each increasing the number of Veterans. This plan is a strongly recommended guideline but should only be deviated for precise reasons.

#### Rollout Planning

- Desired date range: [FILL_IN]
- How will you make the product available in production while limiting the number of users who can find/access it: [FILL_IN].
- What metrics-based criteria will you look at before advancing rollout to the next stage ("success criteria")?: \[use your KPIs to help guide this. It could be things like *abandonment rate < 20%*, *reported contact center calls < 2 calls*, *error rate < 5%*, etc.\]
  - [FILL_IN] : list
  - [FILL_IN] : of
  - [FILL_IN] : KPIs
- Links to the dashboard(s) showing "success criteria" metrics: [FILL_IN] with link to dashboards (example: Google Analytics dashboard)
- Who is monitoring the dashboard(s)?: [FILL_IN]

*The KPIs and numbers are example values recommended by VSP but can be customized to your team's needs.*

### Stage B: 25% of users

*Test a larger user population to ensure larger usage patterns expose no issues.*

## Post Launch metrics

Continue to check in on the KPIs of your feature at periodic intervals to ensure everything is working as expected. We recommend one-week and one-month check-ins, but this is only minimal.

## Post-launch Questions

*To be completed once you have gathered your initial set of data, as outlined above.*

1. How do the KPIs you gathered compare to your pre-launch definition(s) of "success"?
1. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders?
1. Which assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated?
1. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
1. What technical tasks are needed to clean up (i.e., removal of feature toggles)?
