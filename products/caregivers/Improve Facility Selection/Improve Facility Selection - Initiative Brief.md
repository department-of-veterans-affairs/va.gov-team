# Initiative Outline - Improve Facility Selection on the 10-10CG

#### [Epic for 10-10CG Improve Facility Selection](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/19433)
#### [Transition document for Facility Selection](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/Transition%20hub/In%20progress%20features/Facility%20selection.md)

---

## Overview
* Veterans and their Caregivers will have confidence in selecting the Veteran's preferred facility, which will also ensure the submitted application is routed to the appropriate Caregiver service facility for processing

<details>
 
<summary>Initial Request from CG Team:</summary>

>- Current
>     - Provide VA.gov a limited list of VAMCs for Veterans to select
>          - Filtered to where CSC is and does not allow a Veteran to fully answer the questions
>               - **Name of VA medical center or clinic where you receive, or plan to receive, health care services**
>               - **Name of facility where you last received medical treatment**
>     - Worked with Lighthouse team to add “CSC” present toggle in the API
>- PI 7
>     - Connect Lighthouse API to updated internal CARMA VAMC info
>- Needed from VA.gov
>     - Original plan was to have VA.gov connect to Lighthouse as well so they could switch away from the manual list
>     - Open up choices for the Veteran to choose from for those 2 questions
>          - CARMA or MuleSoft would then route the application to the correct VAMC queue in CARMA
>
>CARMA looking into connection with Lighthouse API for VAMC info (eg name, phone number, address, etc)
>- Would go to prod in ~August 2022
>- VA.gov Scope: look into changing VA.gov list of VAMC info for Veteran questions on 1010CG from manual CARMA list to the Lighthouse API

**Feedback from the Facilities team:**
>The facilitator locator uses the Lighthouse API to get data out of the legacy VAST facilities dB to populate search results.

 <summary>Notes from Stakeholder meetings</summary>
 
#### 9/30/2022
**Facilities question**
- This work was not prioritized for CG team to work on in PI 9
- Is there a way for VA.gov team to work on the Facilities work without CARMA work
     - Mapping on va.gov backend matching up clinics to CSC centers and send that to CARMA
          - Lighthouse API has this mapping and already has a mechanism in place to keep it accurate
     - We need to discuss more on what we need to ask for and what needs to be sent to CARMA
     - How can we make sure the user is clear on what this information is being used for and why they are selecting a location?
- **Jenna** will set up a refinement meeting with all parties to go through existing Facilities page and potential solutions on updating the UX

>**Notes from 9/23/22 initial Facilities conversation**
>- Originally, we restrict the locations that Veteran can chose from when completing the 1010 CG to be the ones that have a CSC at them AND are the ones that CARMA has a queue for.
>- The goal originally:
>     - To reduce the manual effort of updating the names of the facilities and where the CSC sits (which is updated in Lighthouse API)
>     - Open up the drop down to allow the Veteran to list wherever and for behind the scenes to route to the correct VAMC queue
>     - Required field on the form
>     - Helps with the in person assessments and checks
>     - Help application assigned to correct CSC and reduces processing times
>     - Potentially opportunity – can we automate using ES? VistA? CERNER? CDW? Prepopulate and allow to change
>- Facility data – has lots of data, but may not be very human friendly

## Problems to solve

* Facility names change often
* Veterans may not know the name of the larger VA Medical Facility 
* Applicants may not know the name of a facilty with Caregiver services
* The layout of the page has been confusing in user research

 
## Desired User Outcomes
- Facility selection is easy and builds confidence
- Facility names are up-to-date, accurate and complete

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Increased difficulty completing the online form
- Delayed application processing due to misrouting

## Desired Business Outcomes
- Applications will be processed at the appropriate facility
- CSCs won't have to reroute applications because of incorrect facility selection

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Increase in the number of applications that are misrouted 

---
## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- User feedback (Medallia)
- Feedback from CSCs on misrouted applications


#### Baseline KPI Values
- Number of online Caregiver applications filled out per month:

### Objectives and Key results (OKRs)
_What are the measurable targets you're aiming for that delivers value for Veterans?_

- Objective: Make it easier for Veterans with representatives to fill out the online form
  - Key result: Reduce the number of applications that are misrouted or delayed (obtained from CSP leadership)
 
|Invalid/Duplicate/Created in error| Monthly Average Baseline (Jan-Dec 2023)| Target | 1 Month after launch|
|--------|-----------------------|----------|--------------------|
|Total Apps (rounded) | 384 | TBD | TBD |
|Total Online Apps (rounded) | 222 | TBD | TBD |



  - Key result: Facilities list is complete, accurate and up to date
       - [JSON static file](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-json-schema/blob/8cdc5f35ad743af51170adad84b92a8b49504bdf/dist/caregiverProgramFacilities.json) contained 142 facilities
       - Facilities API contains **1,252** facilities
  -

## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks
> *Identify risks related to usability, value to users, feasibility/implementation, and viability given organizational constraints<sup>2</sup>. 
> Indicate how you'll validate/test against these risks. Inspired by [SVPG's Four Big Risks](https://www.svpg.com/four-big-risks/).*

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - Applicants want to select the facility that's best for them.

- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - Applicants may not understand the reason for selecting a facility.
  - Applicants may not understand how to use the facility selector/search.
  - Applicants may be given too much information about facility, location, and Caregiver support association and feel overwhelmed when making a decision.

- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
  - API dependencies may cause unplanned outages, causing the facility selector page to be unresponsive
  
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - VA stakeholder End-to-End testing

### What're you building
- Provide an updated facility selection page that is easy to use and understand.
  - Connect with active Facilities API in place of the current static JSON file
  - Revisit UI against the current Facilities selection page on VA.gov and other private sector locator search pages
  - Condust research/usability sessiosn with Veterans to determine the best, easiest to use design
  - Redesign facility selection page
    - Provide applicants with the option to search by city, state or postal code of any given facility to ensure they can select the one that is correct for them.

### Outstanding Questions
- What does the Facility question ideally look like in the future?
  - What information is needed?
  - What is the ultimate purpose this information will serve?
  - How might we get this information a different way?
  - Scenarios
     - If the facility location selected helps determine the associated CG Facility for processing, how does this work if they live in a different state?
     - How does this work for seasonal travelers?
