## Additional content changes requested by CG Stakeholders
- Email recieved from Tiffany Puckett on 3/26/2024 requesting updates to some hint text we have on the form.

>Good morning Drew and Heather,
>
>The CSP | CARMA team would like to request for the VA.gov team to update the online 10-10CG application with the below additional details. These details will help prevent errors on the application. Please let me know if you have questions or need additional clarification.

>- Request to update the clarifying statement above everywhere it is listed on the online application to “Enter the name as it is documented with the Social Security Administration or IRS.” We are seeing an increase in government issued IDs (particularly driver’s license) not having the legal name of the applicant documented. This becomes an issue during the application process and when payments are processed/rejected due to nicknames being used rather than legal names per SSA.

>- Request to update the statement under Veteran’s current home address (and Primary/Secondary Caregiver’s current home address) to “This is the address where the Veteran lives. PO boxes are not accepted in this field.”

>- To prevent the applicant from selecting the state where they live (rather than the state where the VAMC they plan to receive services is located), add a clarifying note under “State” that says “Select the state where the main VA Medical Center is located. This state may be different from the state the Veteran resides in or where the community based clinic is located. If the VAMC you are looking for is not listed, try selecting a neighboring state where the VAMC may be located.”
