### Summary

### Design Decisions

#### [Figma section with visuals](https://www.figma.com/design/TxXD5bGUOhbHHWLb85GPjK/10-10CG?node-id=1069-27287&t=U4D0aixhCfiTe1Ht-4)

**[WIP] County field**
DECISION: 
It is required by the business/back end systems but not an ideal design system option. Opted to move to end of address block and not between city/state fields. Also added an additional info component for "Why we ask for this information" and worked with stakeholders for accurate Veteran and Caregivers context.

Background:
- Flagged by design system
- Design system team very against a required County field
- Concerned people will enter it incorrectly anyway and it’s wrong to put the burden on the user
- Look into USPS API and Mapbox APIs to see if we can auto-compute this
- Consider maybe asking for postal code first and having that pre-populate other fields including County. There’s some educational friction there because people expect the zip code to be last but it is a pattern being used in other places.
- Consider a dropdown of counties based on postal code or state
- Make it clear to our stakeholders that this puts a lot of unnecessary burden on the user

- **Why does the burden need to fall on the Veteran/Caregiver to provide? Other options available?**



---


**Social Security Numbers**
- DECISION: Alignment with [DS Social Security Pattern](https://design.va.gov/patterns/ask-users-for/social-security-number)

**Contact info phone number labels**
- DECISION: Leave phone number labels as primary and secondary

Background: 
- approved this deviation from the design system and acknowledged the current pattern probably needs more options for different scenarios (Design Office hours 5/21/24)
- Work with the forms team to make that a variation of the existing phone number pattern

**Caregiver address order**
- DECISION: Ask for home address first, then mailing. ONLY asking for home address for the Veteran and still want to utilize "same address as" functionality.


- We were struggling with guidance in DS to ask for mailing address first
- Approved asking for home address first (Design Office hours 5/21/24)

**Statement of truth - Plain language**
- DECISION: Update post live 7/10 - Dirction to have 1:1 match in the statement of truth disclosure language


- It's okay for you all to leave in the previous plain language adjustments in the statement of truth sections that are in the version of the form that's in production. When you all have SMEs/stakeholders review, just have them confirm that's okay.
- Included in PDF review #83393 with no changes comment from stakeholders
- Post go-live reqeust from stakeholders/SMEs to make it match 1:1



#### Future Notes

**Multiple Responses List-and-loop Pattern**

- This just recently became a pattern available in the forms library vs a custom experimental pattern
- There are slight differences between the custom solution and what is available, will determine in ticket #83290 next steps

- [[UX, FE] 10-10CG - Improvements: Exploration on adding List & Loop pattern on Secondary Caregiver section #83290](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/83290)



**Primary and Secondary Caregiver Clarification**
- Received non-urgent SME feedback to include more clarification around caregiver roles, eligibility and benefits on the intro page and within the form
- Have old epic [ON-HOLD - 10-10CG - Primary/Secondary Caregiver clarification #37541]()


**Relationship to Veteran question**
Content standards are to avoid gendered language whenever possible. We discussed updating with the business and the work to update and align their database fields are not an initiative at this time but they did mention it being on their radar to align with VA-wide standards.

- Have options to select (and in CARMA) and in content be gender neutral.
- Example being: not son or daughter but child, not mother or father but parent.
- Move to own page, one question per page



**Birth sex / gender question**

- Updated label and hint text but not adding option for “X” with these June 2024 updates. Option not available in backend systems and want to align within VA and program.
- SME Answers 5.3.24
- SIGI field in CARMA, but MPI uses Birth Sex field for legal identity traits - If this inforamtion is not provided, it prevents a health record from being created - A health record is created for all Caregivers (Primary and both Secondary) - Working with VA LGBTQ+ contacts & MPI for advisement - Eventually being standardized across VA - Workaround until standard update is implemented - Veteran and Caregivers can provide SIGI with CG staff
- Link provided in chat - https://www.patientcare.va.gov/LGBT/docs/FAQ-BirthSex-SelfIdentifiedGenderIdentityFactSheet.pdf


**File upload**

- Using v1 file upload button / component pattern at launch, will evaluate when this pattern is ready from the design system when to implement.
