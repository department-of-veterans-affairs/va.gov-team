## January 13, 2023 CG Stakeholder Touchbase

### Notes (outstanding questions answered!!)
- **Duplicate info entered on applications**
     - Application is considered duplicate info, even if there is new information too
     - Scenario:
          - Veteran wants to add new 2nd
          - Applies and lists primary again along with new 2nd
          - Application goes thru duplicate process
          - Veteran has to apply again without primary listed
     - Can we call MPI for approved caregiver?
          - Don't want to block if it is approved, but can we check for matching info in same position?
     - **Opportunity** How can we help applicants understand how to fill out the form?
     - Do we know the volume of applications that are considered duplicate?
          - We can pull this 
          - Caveat - based on staff marking application properly according to policy
          - This could include when a primary is entered incorrectly on secondary role
     - **Tiffany will send with monthly volumes when we send routine request**

- Do we know the ratio or volume or applications that are approved vs declined?  
     - 10-10 team does not have visibility into this metric and wondered what the most common reasons for rejection, if there is a significant volume
     - Our question to ourselves would be Is there anything we can change that could help reduce the volume of rejected applications?
     - **Tiffany will send with monthly volumes when we send routine request**

- We are looking for topic trends regarding Veterans or Caregivers calling in that may pertain to the application process or information. 
     - One trend we are seeing from the survey data is that some people are confused, trying to apply to get a Caregiver assigned to them by VA, or trying to apply for a Caregiver job (as opposed to a Caregiver for a specific Veteran).
     - Are there other trends like this that we should consider when looking at improvements and content updates?
          - They dont know stuff, causing delays
               - They dont know to use primary physical residence vs mailing/PO box
               - DOB functionality is not being used right 
                    - year or day will flip one over (one number off)
               - Signature fields 
                    - wrong person name entered (secondary enteres in primary field)
                    - This can only occur on the Paper form, the Online form has a field validation
               - First & Last name 
                    - listing Jon instead of Jonathan, Cat or Cathy instead of Catherine
               - Non-req fields that are useful 
                    - Such as Middle name, useful in ensuring Bank info matches so payments can be processed
          - Business is working on video and document How-to
          - **Opportunity** How can we help reduce these kinds of errors?


- Is there a way to obtain the volume of rerouted applications, due to Veteransâ€™ preferred facility selections?
     - We are considering this as an important metric, once we can deploy the updated Facility Selection page update.
     - **Ramesh & team working to get this data for us** with caveat that we will not be able to tell whether it is Veteran/Caregiver initiated or CG team initiated

- MuleSoft API - VA.gov receiving 503 Service Not Available errors since 1/5/2023
     - Ruman - **Mili/Rama DTC created ticket to check on the load balance logs**
     - Updates will be posted on the same slack conversation - https://salesforcemyva.slack.com/archives/C042QS1RLP9/p1673474170681999

**Notes from Tham**

Notes 

- Ratio of applications approved vs declined
     - Business have the data available - Tiffany to share with Heather along with monthly report.

- Top trends on why people call into the support team,
     - We are looking for topic trends regarding Veterans or Caregivers calling in that may pertain to the application process or information.
          - Tiffany - Mistakes while filling in 10-10CG applications
          - These are some examples which delays the process
               - Need to use their primary/physical address - Location, PO
               - Date of birth - Year or date flip over (may be a data entry or technical functionality)
               - Wrong Name for role (in place of secondary CG , updating primary)
               - Legal Name (nick names or short names), issues when correlating with MPI
               - Signature field - should match with the legal name
               - Non required field - details for Stipend team (bank)
               - CSP team is working on Demo video on "how to fill 10-10CG"
 

- Volumes on how many applications we get that have duplicated information (for example: applying to add a secondary cg, but including the primary cg info on the app unnecessarily, resulting in completing the app again without the primary cg info)
     - Tiffany - can pull numbers per monthly and share with Heather
     - Also application numbers, created in error (wrong name/role) - which creates a new application
 

- Is it possible to pull a metrics report for Selection Initiative ?
     - The incorrect routing and rerouting of applications, due to the Veteran's preferred facility selected. Is there a way to see/get the volume of these rerouted applications?

     - Last update: 
          - Ramesh/Ranga: I started to pull the metrics, but was not able to narrow down good filters to identify who initiated the change of MC. This one might be a little tricky to just pull using Salesforce reports.
          - Heather: Like to get a data history
          - AI Tham to do a quick reminder on the slack conversation

- Mulesoft API error - slack conversation - 503 errors.
     - Ruman - Mili/Rama DTC created ticket to check on the load balance unlocks
     - Updates will be posted on the same slack conversation - https://salesforcemyva.slack.com/archives/C042QS1RLP9/p1673474170681999
