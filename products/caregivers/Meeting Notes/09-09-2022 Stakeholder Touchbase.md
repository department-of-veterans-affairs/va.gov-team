## September 9, 2022 CG Stakeholder Touchbase

### Notes

- Special character issue
  - Users have seen applications that come from VA.gov with special characters "wouldn't translate well"
    - Apostrophes are generating as question marks
    - Has the code been changed recently?
      - Not recently; likely has been an issue from the start
  - Can this be addressed for the 10/01 release?
    - Not certain; still lots of work to be done
    - Can be added to the backlog to be addressed if we have the time
    - **Non-critical issue**
  - Will need to review the PDF creation process
- 10/01 Eligibility Changes Content
  - On VA.gov side of the house, do we want/need to change anything for the 10/01 expansion?
  - 10-10 team unlikely to need to do anything
    - Content Team will update landing page
      - Special content release to be done on 10/01
- Queueing Update
  - Mulesoft may launch their changes a day or two early
    - Will need to verify that we can still submit to their V1 endpoints
      - Can be tested in a lower environment
