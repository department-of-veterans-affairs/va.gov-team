## May 13, 2022 CG Stakeholder Touchbase

### Notes:
- Previous Action Items
    - Should we require an email address for CG?
        - No answer yet
        - Only about ~5% don’t have a Veteran email
            - If combining Veteran + Primary, percentage still remains very low (no exact number)
    - Should we use email for messages?
        - Yes
    - Send Points of Contacts for VA Notify
        - Done
- Metrics
- MuleSoft
    - Why did we install it?
        - Wanted to decouple [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) from Salesforce
            - Multiple benefits
                - Loosely-coupled
                - [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) don’t have to worry about changes to Salesforce
                - [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) will be posting to MuleSoft, which will post to Salesforce
    - How is it helping?
        - Timeouts
            - Long calls to Salesforce can have API timeouts
                - No indication of whether the application was processed
            - Implementation of MuleSoft allows to build a queue
                - Client no longer needs to wait for transaction to finish
                - Call will be deposited to the queue
            - Multiple options
                - Wait a little bit, let the client know whether the application has been processed
    - How does it work?
        - Did not introduce a lot of change
        - Take the APIs from Salesforce and moved it to MuleSoft
            - Authentication will change
                - MuleSoft authentication is different
        - Payload and responses will remain the same
    - Metrics
        - Address failure rate of applications
            - “Sorry, we couldn’t process, here’s a PDF to mail in”
    - Goal
        - Send the entire payload
            - Application + Payload
        - Will process synchronously when possible
            - “Artificial timeout” > 30 seconds
                - Inform user of queueing
        - After 24 hours, several retries, etc, will generate a ticket
    - Postmortem / Retrospective
        - Tentatively 5/20
- LightHouse
    - Currently provide limited list of VAMCs to select
        - Filtered to centers that have CSC
    - Does not allow Veterans to necessarily select their center or where they’re ceiveing care
    - PI 7
        - Connect LightHouse API to internal CARMA / VAMC
        - Development work to connect to LightHouse API slated to start 5/30
    - VA.gov
        - Switch [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) to using the Lighthouse API so we no longer need the manual list
            - Allow Veteran to select VA medical center where they receive, or plan to receive, care services
            - Name of facility where you last received medical treatment
        - Thought is to then allow more choices for the veteran to choose for those 2 questions
        - CARMA and/or Mulesoft would then route the request to the appropriate queue
- Future Work (6+ months away)
    - [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) CARMA portal
        - Allow Veterans / Caregivers to login and view their applications
- Sign as Rep
    - 100 applications from VA.gov
        - 55 successful
        - 45 failures
        - Reasons
            - General POAs
            - Incomplete documents
            - CG document itself
            - What can we do to increase the accuracy?
        - Of the 45 invalid documents, 42 were signed by someone other than the Veteran
    - Go to 100% in ~1 month
- Questions
    - Why use MuleSoft instead of building the queue on the [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) side?
        - Easiest route
        - Previous experiences with man-in-the-middle lead to a lot of errors
            - MITM would always state that it was the other end; could possibly happen again
        - Can handle the process as a single transaction
            - Current process involves sending multiple synchronous calls
            - Can we deliver both parts as a single call?
    - Why not queue everything?
        - 2% - 5% lacking email will never get notified
    - How much extra work is the hybrid model going to work?
        - If the hybrid model proves to be a lot of work, we can use a full queue
    - Should we be exposing this much information (queued vs. not) to our users?
        - No matter what, we should be messaging back to the user that their application has been submitted
            - “Let the magic happen behind the scenes”
        - Will allow us to post a response to the user faster since we don’t need to wait for a determination
    - Vets API can handle retries
        - May be able to handle the process without MuleSoft
            - Need to dig into some additional information
