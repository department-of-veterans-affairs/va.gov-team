## October 7, 2022 CG Stakeholder Touchbase

### Notes

Facilities search discussion
- Last received - why are we asking?
     - helped figure out where to move app to.
     - Don't know that there is a benefit to having it there
     - PDF fields mapped, could this cause an error downstream
          - however this is an optional field, so data can be blank
     - Heather to check into what it would take to remove this section and when we might be able to align with the paper form update

- Preferred facility
     - zip code, city, state is used on CG support line
     - investigated before, 5 closest and went thru a rabbit hole
     - limitation of 90 minute drive (LH API), processing time on the site too, causes timeouts with too broad a search

### Notes from Tham

CARMA VA.gov Priorities work list
- Future CARMA Enhancements
     - W-017223: CARMA to Check for Duplicate Submissions
          - As a CSC receiving online applications from VA.gov or the HEC, I would like CARMA to notify me if there is a suspected duplicate application so that I can review the applications that are similar to determine which item to keep. 

     - W-019029: DEV: va.gov would like to change how they send some attributes
          - As a va.gov developer I want to send the "last medical facility" and "facility type" in a flattened structure so that it better represents the data elements.
     - The data elements will remain the same, but will be flatted vs nested.
     - We are going to work on the facilities page -
     - AI Heather -- Va.gov how they are sending the info - Attributes and confirm Tham to add the item into Backlog
 
- CARMA Facility/VAMC Automation (Lighthouse API)
     - Put VA.gov online 10-10CG instructions in Spanish & Tagalog
          - Separate team manages the languages - AI Heather to connect with them
 
- Lighthouse API work refinement sessions - CARMA Facility/VAMC Automation (Lighthouse API)
     - Scheduled for 10/25 â€“ wait for the paper form application is updated to match up together.
     - VA.Gov ready to start with Lighthouse work schedule
     - Va.Gov just want to get feedback so we can start working on it. last week, we agreed that our team could do the work without CG team work
     - Lighthouse API - Is it necessary to ask both of these questions?
