## Notes
### Questions from 10-10 team
- Optional info - In an effort to reduce burden and present Veterans/Caregivers with the minimum required fields, we are being asked to obtain explanations for the optional fields.  This will allow us to provide explanations onscreen so that Veterans/Caregivers know why the info is needed and what it will be used for
     - On fields that are optional, like SSN, and birth sex
          - Is there any context that can be provided for the reason/benefit of asking for it?
          - What benefit would they get if they provide that?
          - What benefit does that provide to the internal support staff when processing?
          - What is the impact to the applicants and/or staff if that information is not provided?
          - In Michael’s response, the SSN/TIN is used for identity verification and vendorization.  What does “vendorization” mean?
     - **ANSWERS**     
          - Need info.  Best if provided at front.  Not listed as required to keep from blocking the app online.  
          - Challenging for staff if info is not provided upfront when correlating with MPI. This information is more of a benefit for staff than Veteran/Caregiver
          - Primary CG must be vendorized - to be paid as a vendor of VA - for monthly stipend 
     - Birth sex
          - Advisement from Content team on adding an additional option on the birth sex question "X"
               - Currently, we only have two options and would not pass the third option to CARMA, as it would not be able to accept the input
       - **ANSWERS**
               - SIGI field in CARMA, but MPI uses Birth Sex field for legal identity traits
               - If this inforamtion is not provided, it prevents a health record from being created
                    - A health record is created for all Caregivers (Primary and both Secondary)
               - Working with VA LGBTQ+ contacts & MPI for advisement
               - Eventually being standardized across VA
               - Workaround until standard update is implemented - Veteran and Caregivers can provide SIGI with CG staff

               - https://www.patientcare.va.gov/LGBT/docs/FAQ-BirthSex-SelfIdentifiedGenderIdentityFactSheet.pdf
- Addresses
     - On collecting multiple addresses and where information gets sent.
          - How are the addresses used for the applicants?
          - For example, we understand the Veteran's home address is used for in-home visits.  
          - Is there any context for what Caregiver home and mailing addresses are used for?
          - Where are decision documents sent?
          - Are there other documents sent via mail?
     - **ANSWERS**
          - CGs recv benefits, so letters & any other comms (such as program status during application processing) will go to mailing address 
          - Everyone gets a copy!
- Phone numbers
     - Listed as primary and alternate on VA.gov
          - However other forms have Home & Mobile
     - **ANSWERS**
          - Listed as primary and alternate in CARMA
          - Used to have home & mobile, but it was confusing as to which to call
- Relationship dropdown
     - 10-10 team explained removing gender-specific relations
          - Ex: son, daughter, replacing with child
          - Will need to align on this with CARMA
     - **ANSWERS**
          - Keep as-is for now and possibly visit in future as teams have capacity
          - From Mitch: Keep in mind there are frontend and backend changes will be needed from VA.gov and CARMA - will need to schedule these changes together
