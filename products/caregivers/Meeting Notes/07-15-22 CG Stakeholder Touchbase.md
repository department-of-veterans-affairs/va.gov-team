Prior Action Items
- Catastrophic Failure SOP
  - Will have to investigate whether this has been started
    - Can retry update be deployed early?
        - 10/01 will allow for substantially more Veterans to apply for caregiver assistance
            - Big event last time this happened
            - Potential for lots of attentions / problems
        - VA Team would like to keep 09/23 as the targeted deadline
            - Nothing stopping us from releasing early if all the work is done ahead of time
            - 09/23 is just more realistic of a goal
        - When will this go into staging?
            - In staging by 09/15
        - How do we test these changes at a volume of greater than 1 - 2 applications at a time
- New API documentation for CG updates
    - Ruman to provide updated documentation on 07/15
- [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) team to look into *Vetern Not in MPI* errors
    - Longer term research into validity of errors and determine whether there were any frontend tweaks to help ensure clean / accurate information is provided
    - Saw some MPI timeout errors
        - Flagged as *other* errors
    - How can you programmatically catch errors about a form that’s being filled out?
        - Don’t know at this time; would like the opportunity to investigate further
    - Lots of logic goes into identifying a Veteran in MPI
    - May not be necessary to further investigate
        - Rare to have a spike in this
        - Only so much that can be done to account for a user inputting information incorrectly
    - Revised plan
        - There was a spike; no news of an outage
        - Let’s review the errors during the spike to confirm whether there was an actual problem at the time
    - Was this limited to a specific timeframe?
        - If so, have we spoken with MPI about this?

Tasks
- [ ] Catastrophic Failure SOP
    - Follow up with Heather - has this been started?
- [ ]  Can we get an update on when ICN will be added to the payload?
