## September 30, 2022 CG Stakeholder Touchbase

### Notes

- Jenna running the meeting today

**Schedule of what va.gov is doing this weekend**
- Ready to monitor volumes, no issues so far
- Will follow the alert process if any errors or alerts occur

**Content changes on static page for 10/1 eligibility**
- Update to occur 10/1 by 10am ET

**Facilities question**
- This work was not prioritized for CG team to work on in PI 9
- Is there a way for VA.gov team to work on the Facilities work without CARMA work
     - Mapping on va.gov backend matching up clinics to CSC centers and send that to CARMA
          - Lighthouse API has this mapping and already has a mechanism in place to keep it accurate
     - We need to discuss more on what we need to ask for and what needs to be sent to CARMA
     - How can we make sure the user is clear on what this information is being used for and why they are selecting a location?
- **Jenna** will set up a refinement meeting with all parties to go through existing Facilities page and potential solutions on updating the UX

>**Notes from 9/23/22 initial Facilities conversation**
>- Originally, we restrict the locations that Veteran can chose from when completing the 1010 CG to be the ones that have a CSC at them AND are the ones that CARMA has a queue for.
>- The goal originally:
>     - To reduce the manual effort of updating the names of the facilities and where the CSC sits (which is updated in Lighthouse API)
>     - Open up the drop down to allow the Veteran to list wherever and for behind the scenes to route to the correct VAMC queue
>     - Required field on the form
>     - Helps with the in person assessments and checks
>     - Help application assigned to correct CSC and reduces processing times
>     - Potentially opportunity – can we automate using ES? VistA? CERNER? CDW? Prepopulate and allow to change
>- Facility data – has lots of data, but may not be very human friendly
