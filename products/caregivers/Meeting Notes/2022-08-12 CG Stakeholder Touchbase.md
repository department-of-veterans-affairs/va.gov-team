## Aug 12, 2022 CG Stakeholder Touchbase

### Notes

- Review current language on the Sign as a Rep pages within the application
     - CG Stakholder team received approvals to accept general POA documents for Veterans with Representatives signing for them
     - Provided suggestions for the updated language
     - Questions on whether a "Financial Power of Attorney" is acceptable, and whether we can leave references to "medical proxy", since states have different titles for their document.

- CG Team reviewed their update for the Hello World initiative on automatic submission emails to applicants (we've received your application)
