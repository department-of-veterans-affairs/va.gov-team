- SOP Review - suggestions from the audience
     - Add a note that the PDF being emailed will be encrypted
     - Add maintenance window banner to stop apps coming thru until resolution
          - This can be done on a case by case basis
     - Look into implementing an earlier alert to start investigation prior to calling it catastrophic
- Mulesoft - Single Payload API
     - Available 8/25
     - To test now (before 8/25), will need to use Dev environments 
          - Environments need to be realigned
          - VA.gov dev pointing to Mule Test currently
          - VA.gov dev will need to realign to Mule API dev
          - May need to realign environments for full End-to-End testing
