## June 2, 2023 CG Stakeholder Touchbase

### Notes (outstanding questions answered)
- The process when editing caregivers, and thinking about what part of that manual process could be automated online if we were able to pull existing CG data.
     - Removing a caregiver
          - Requests - ask that it is submitted in writing to staff from Veteran
          - Staff enters “discharge” in CARMA
          - Educate Veteran on reapplication
     - If CG wants to be removed, 
          - Staff would let veteran know and would ask to reapply if they want to (especially if it is a Primary CG being removed)
- Other touchpoints of interactions after application/program start
     - Wellness contacts
          - 120 days and as clinically needed
     - Reassessments (depending on regulation, usually annually for eligibility, or as clinically needed)
          - **Some reassessments are currently on pause**
     - Changes for Veteran care level, additional resources needed for care
     - Eligibility/Compliance assessments
     - Most cases/assessments include a Home Care visit
     - Some VISNs/Facilities working with Scheduling for some sort of digital solutions
     - Caregiver support (education, resources, etc)

- When the Veteran changes preferred facilities (how is that done, where does that info come from) and how might we be involved there from CG updates.
     - Stay away from eligibility reqs - it changes often!
     - Veteran reaches out to CSP informing of moving/transfer of care 
          - Must be done within 30 days of move
     - Facility owns record in CARMA, and it needs to be transferred to new facility
     - Address change in CARMA generates tasks for stipend/benefits teams
     - CSP transfers record in CARMA and contacts new VAMC about the transfer
     - Veterans & Caregivers are directed to do this during initial roles & responsibilities - document with expectations 


 

### Notes from Tham
- About denial reasons – anything to reduce denial reasons.
     - Using legal names instead of shortened names,
     - Using physical address instead of PO boxes, etc. 
     - What other denial reasons stand out? 
          - Could this be due to Caregivers not understanding their eligibility requirements?  
                 - Not any stable requirements, at the moment to stay away.
 

- Revisit the possibility of having an authenticated experience on VA.gov. 
     - On the process when editing caregivers, and thinking about what part of that manual process could be automated online if we were able to pull existing CG data.
     - When there is only one CG and want to change - need to submit a new 10-10CG >> how is this process happening? 
          - CG needs to put it on writing and via CARMA process, 
          - the CG will be educated on new application.
          - If the veteran is unable to do the change by themselves they need to choose in charge and communicate to the teams on CG change.
     - Wellness contact, 
          - as a follow up where in CSP staff interact with CG's ( annual reassessment, per eligibility  and reassessments as needed, care etc) 
          - Home care data collection involved in this process.
 

- Also, when the Veteran changes preferred facilities (how is that done, where does that info come from) and how might we be involved there from CG updates.
     - Veteran/CG reach out to the local CSP staff to inform on the location change or change in facility 
     - >> CSP staff make the task on CARMA if there is any address change and stipend change based on new address. (have to be within 30 days of the move)
     - They reach out to the receiving facility and inform the veteran/CG move and update the records.
