## November 4, 2022 CG Stakeholder Touchbase

### Notes

- 1010CG Timeout Error:
     - MuleSoft did 1010CG PROD Patch Deployment on 10/25
     - If VA.Gov sends a duplicate re-try then it would not send an notification duplicate e-mail out.
     - As Next Step: Paul worked on the failed Payload file and sent the findings to Margaret/Business
- VA.Gov Re-try was due to Network error - Anything we can do to prevent it?
     - API logs went through correctly
     - AI Lihan to check on the error - Discuss internally and confirm on the issues behind fix â€“ ask Dev Ops team for the issue details and let the team know
          - We are still working on finding the exact cause of the problem, maybe it was caused by va.gov network connection.
          - We need to find what caused the error and how to reproduce the error, only then we can fix a solution. (platform support team doesn't know either)
          - Very minimal % of error - other errors are resolved. We can continue to chase on this error but not urgent.
- VA.Gov call schedule to biweekly and 30 minutes
     - Changing our weekly Va.Gov Touchbase call to Bi-weekly and 30 minutes call duration.
