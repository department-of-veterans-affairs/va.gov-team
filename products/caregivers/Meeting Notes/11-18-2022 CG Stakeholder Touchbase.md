## November 18, 2022 CG Stakeholder Touchbase

### Notes

- Marla running the meeting today

#### Agenda
- **Facilities questions**
     - Future state:
          - Most likely will not need to know the preferred facility selected by the Veteran
               - Informational: Medical centers have CBOC staff, community facilities mostly don't. 
     - Per Matt: Don't know if we will always need the "Recent Medical Care Facility" info
          - As of right now, we keep the question, but still looking at getting it removed
     - If a Veteran prefers a facility far away from the home, this would also mean that the Caregiver processing location may be far.  
          - How are home visits and other services handled? 
          - How are seasonal travelers handled? 
               - Depends on the case and the facility - varies

- **Duplicate info entered on applications**
     - Application is considered duplicate info, even if there is new information too
     - Scenario:
          - Veteran wants to add new 2nd
          - Applies and lists primary again along with new 2nd
          - Application goes thru duplicate process
          - Veteran has to apply again without primary listed
     - Can we call MPI for approved caregiver?
          - Don't want to block if it is approved, but can we check for matching info in same position?
     - **Opportunity** We could add some info to the form about this

- **Additional questions are pending CG team review and response:**
     - Do we know the ratio or volume or applications that are approved vs declined?  
          - We don't have visibility into this metric and wondered what the most common reasons for rejection, if there is a significant volume
          - Our question to ourselves would be Is there anything we can change that could help reduce the volume of rejected applications?
     - **Pending CG Team review**

     - We are looking for topic trends regarding Veterans or Caregivers calling in that may pertain to the application process or information. 
          - One trend we are seeing from the survey data is that some people are confused, trying to apply to get a Caregiver assigned to them by VA, or trying to apply for a Caregiver job (as opposed to a Caregiver for a specific Veteran).
          - Are there other trends like this that we should consider when looking at improvements and content updates?
     - **Pending CG Team review**

     - Is there a way to obtain the volume of rerouted applications, due to Veterans’ preferred facility selections?
          - We are considering this as an important metric, once we can deploy the updated Facility Selection page update.
     - **Pending CG Team review**
