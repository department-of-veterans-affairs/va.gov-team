## February 24, 2023 CG Stakeholder Touchbase

### Notes
- Facilities design review
     - There was a question on whether 'common' names can be displayed, rather than the actual facility name since alot of Veterans do not know or would recognize the official facility name.
     - **Heather** will check with Facilities team to find out if there is anything
     - Mentioned also that this is why we would also display the address, so that something might be recognizable and the applicant can be confident in their selection.
