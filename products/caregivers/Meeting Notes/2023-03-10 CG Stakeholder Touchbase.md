### Notes - Questions to the business to support the Primary/Secondary clarification discovery work
We are starting to dive into the Primary and Secondary Caregiver roles, in an effort to understand the processes when new ones are being added or changed, we posed some questions and got some great info!

1. What kicks off a caregiver getting discharged when replaced? Does it need to happen via a call or visit or can it happen online?
     - This person can initiate changes in those ways, but a form (online or paper) will need to be filled out regardless of the initiation channel.  A clinical meeting/call will always happen to go over the changes with the Veteran and Caregiver.

2. What scenarios require a “full” application?
     - A new caregiver, replacement of existing caregiver requires the application.
When completing the application, it must contain at least one new caregiver (the primary or one of the 2 allowable secondaries).  The application does not require all roles to be completed, although it can be done if the Veteran has a person chosen for each role.

3. What is the business process for changes to caregivers assigned and what do Veterans/caregivers have to do/their role in this process?
     - When a change is requested, staff will meet the Veteran & Caregiver to discuss it from a clinical perspective.  Secondary caregivers can’t move into primary caregiver role without the application submission and formal checks again.
     - We can also note that if a Secondary Caregiver is applying to be a Primary Caregiver (after the initial Primary has been discharged), they will remain in the Secondary Caregiver role until they are approved to be the Primary.  Then they are discharged as Secondary and registered as Primary.  This may be subject to CARMA system restrictions, however not sure if this would impact how we approach the application information.

4. Do they have to fill out an online/paper app at some point even if they call/visit in person to verbally request the change?
     - Yes. It all leads back to the form for processing.
     - We can note here that it is a regulation requirement to have the form completed and submitted again for any changes in roles.  This also explains why a new application is needed to add new caregivers in empty roles.

5. Are there any other ways Veterans manage/have a say in the caregivers assigned to them?
     - No. It’s just the 1010CG form.
     - We did get confirmation that any time a 10-10CG form is received, a call is made to the Veteran to assess the situation and confirm that a change in a Caregiver is being requested.
