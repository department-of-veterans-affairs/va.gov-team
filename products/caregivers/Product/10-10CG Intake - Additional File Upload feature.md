>- Gaspare:  Add New Feature
>   - Adding a feature to upload supporting medical documentation from applicants
>   - Team is exploring different scenarios and was curious about potential logistics
>   - Reviewing early stages - exploring only at this point
>        - Currently allow representative file upload currently
>        - Other documentation TBD (Heather AI to check)
>        - 10 MB limit of individual, file upload - no current limit of number of files to be uploaded (total payload size of 150 MB) -
>             - specs from Salesforce size/number requirements for uploads -->  https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=experience.collab_files_size_limits.htm&type=5
>        - Privacy and Security checks already in place - can follow the same/current passthru
>        - WOULD require an update to PIA & PTA (approx 8+ week turnaround) - would require review with SecRisk
>        - AI Gaspare: 
>             - The Why/Benefit for adding this new functionality -->  Duty to Assist requirements (CSP for supporting Vets)
