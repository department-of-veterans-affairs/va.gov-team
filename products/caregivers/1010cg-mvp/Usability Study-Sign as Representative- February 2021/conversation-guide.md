## Project-Specific Setup and Intro - 10 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Jonathan and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to review a prototype about federal benefits that are provided to caregivers of Veterans.

- This entire session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- You'll be interacting with a prototypes and a demo tool. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- Please talk aloud as you're looking through things. For example, say "now I'd click on this.. what's this?" This helps me understand what's going through your head while using the tool.
- To protect your privacy, we are not going to use your real name or Social Security Number today. Feel free to make-up a name, birthday, SSN...I can always provide that information if you want
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

**Talk them through Zoom screen sharing and chat features.

**If mobile participant**
- First, I want to make sure your technology is ready to go for this session. Can you confirm for me what type of device you're using to join today?
    -Great, that helps me troubleshoot with you if we run into any problems.
    
_For iPhone:_
- When you are inside the Zoom application on your phone, you'll see a few buttons at the bottom. Audio, Video, Share Content, Participants, and three dots over to the right. If you tap on those dots, you'll also see a function called "Chat". If you don't tap the screen for a while, the icons at the bottom will hide. You can tap anywhere on the screen to get them to show. The ones that will be important for us today are "chat" and "share content." Any questions?
- Tap ‘Share Content’ (Green button at bottom middle of the screen)
- Tap on Screen
- Tap Zoom
- Tap “Start broadcast” . After a count of 3, the entire device screen will be shared into the meeting
- Tap the red bar at the top of your screen when you are ready to end the share
- Great, now I can see your phone screen! I'm going to begin now if that's ok with you. We will return to this in a few moments.
_For troubleshooting screen sharing in iOS, reference the Zoom documentation here https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005890803-iOS-Screen-Sharing_

_For Android:_
- When you are inside the zoom application on your phone, you'll see a few buttons at the bottom. For instance, Share and three dots over to the right. If you tap on those dots, you'll also see a function called "Chat". If you don't tap the screen for a while, the icons at the bottom will hide. You can tap anywhere on the screen to get them to show. The ones that will be important for us today are "Chat" and "Share." Any questions?
- Tap "Share"
- Tap "Screen"
- May give a "sensitive info" alert
- May ask you to give Zoom permission to display over other apps, toggle yes. Then hit the back arrow.

**I'm going to send you a link in the chat.**
_ I actually do this as I’m explaining to them where to find “Chat” and “Share,” so by the end I’m looking at their screen, then I move onto recording._

**Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:**

- Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "Drive". You will tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok?
- [Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen?


**Recording Instructions**

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording to the Cloud.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?"** 

Great. Now we're really ready to begin!

## Applying for benefits task with first representative option - 15 minutes

Now that I understand a little bit more about your caregiving background. I’m going to have you imagine that you’re applying for benefits for you (or your caregivers) through the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers. Walk me through how you would do this.

Things to watch for:

In general, we want to sit back and watch them, but if they hesitate you can say “I noticed you hesitate here, what are you thinking?”

- Remind participants to think out loud. 
- Any hiccups? Do they know all the information?
- Any fields trip them up?
- Anything particularly confusing for them?
- Pay close attention to the representative and document upload sections 
  - What documents would you upload here?
  - Would you have themn on hand? 
  - If on mobile, what would you do?
- Make sure to dig in when there's any hesitation into what they are thinking
- Any confusion understanding primary and secondary caregivers?

## Post task questions - 10 minutes

Wonderful! I have a few questions about what you just saw in the prototype.

- What did you think of the overall experience in completing this form?
- What was the hardest part of completing the form? Were there any areas you felt were unclear? 
- What worked well? 
- I'm going to quickly show you my screen (moderator shares screen with “representative” question)
   - Can you tell me how you decided/knew that you were/weren’t a representative?
   - _If they were confused when completing this section._ What could we do to improve the information around representatives? 
   - Can you elaborate on your reasoning for your selection?
- _If not addressed in tasks_ 
  -  What documents would you upload here?
  -  Would you have themn on hand? 
  -  If on mobile, what would you do?

## Wrap-up questions - 5 minutes

- Any other thoughts about the form?
- Do you have any questions for me before we conclude?
