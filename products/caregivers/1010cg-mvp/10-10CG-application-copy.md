**We'll now guide you through the steps to review and sign your application**

First, we need to know if the Veteran will sign the application or if a representative will sign for them.

A representative must have legal authority to make medical decisions for the Veteran. If you choose this option, we'll ask you to upload a document that proves you have this authority.


Learn more about the types of documents we can and can't accept _(more info)_

We can only accept a document that proves you have legal authority to make medical decisions for the Veteran. This type of document is sometimes called a medical proxy or medical power of attorney.

We can't accept a marriage certificate, driver's license, or release of information form. We also can't accept a general or financial power of attorney without medical stipulation. Uploading a document that we can't accept may delay the application process.

_(end more info)_

**Note:** We use this signature only to process your application. Signing for the Veteran today doesn't take away their right to make decisions for their care.

Select who will sign for the Veteran today:

The Veteran

A representative with legal authority to make medical decisions

**Upload your supporting document** 

We can only accept a document that proves you have legal authority to make medical decisions for the Veteran. This type of document is sometimes called a medical proxy or medical power of attorney.

**Don't have the right type of document?** Go back to the last screen. The Veteran will need to sign the application for themselves.

**How to upload your document**
- Choose a document that we can accept (like a medical proxy or medical power of attorney). Don't upload a marriage certificate, driver's license, or release of information form. And don't upload a general or financial power of attorney without a medical stipulation. Uploading a document that we can't accept may delay the application process.
- Save a scanned copy or photo of the entire document on your device. We can't accept a cover or signature page without the rest of the document.
- Format the file as a .pdf, .jpg, .jpeg, or .png. Be sure the file is 10MB or less in size.

_After upload_ 

**Check your upload before you continue**

It’s easy to upload the wrong file by mistake. We want to make sure that we review the right document (like a medical proxy or medical power of

attorney). This will help speed up your application process. 

Check the file name to make sure that this is the document you want to upload before you continue. If it's not, you can delete this file and upload another one.
