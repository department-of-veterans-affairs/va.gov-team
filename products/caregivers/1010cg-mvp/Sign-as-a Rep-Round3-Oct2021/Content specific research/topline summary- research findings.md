# **[DRAFT] VSA Caregiver, Mental model and Content-specific comprehension study for the 10-10CG document upload, November 2021 - Topline Summary**

We talked to 7 caregiver participants - 3 in the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers. 

## **Sign as Rep Feature**

**TLDR;** This 

**Recommendation:** Keep the current design on the question and upload pages, but add a little more information about what "counts" as representative documentation and tweak the copy on the upload page. Consider running more sessions and/or thinking more about the review/signature page keeping in consideration that the prospective Caregiver might also be the POA.

**Details**

### Question Page

* The redesigned "question page" where participants answered if they wanted to upload documentation overall worked well, participants were much more comfortable moving through it [than in the previous round of testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/1010cg-mvp/Usability%20Study-Sign%20as%20Representative-%20February%202021/research-findings.md)

* An improvement could be made, namely to put a few more examples of what "counts" and “doesn’t count,”, e.g. tell people if VA Medical Power of Attorney “counts as yes” 

### Upload Page

* This page was fairly self-explanatory to most users. Participants who said they were representatives said they would have their documentation handy

* One participant thought the copy at the top was *"kind of strange, and kind of no duh"*

### Signature Page

* One participant who saw the representative box signed the veteran’s name instead of her own when it asked for the representative’s signature. She found it strange that she was being asked to enter her name twice on the signature page (once as rep, once as primary caregiver). Another participant hesitated slightly at the Representative’s signature box, and asked if she would sign the veteran’s name or her own, before deciding to sign with her own name.

## **Primary / Secondary Caregiver questions / tweaked language**

**TLDR;** These questions still caused confusion with participants - the new language did seem to help a little bit ([no one confused the question with primary care physician, as in the past test, for example](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/1010cg-mvp/Usability%20Study-Sign%20as%20Representative-%20February%202021/research-findings.md)), but it wasn’t perfect.

**Recommendation:** Keep the new language, but pick up [this ticket ](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vsa---caregiver-5fff0cfd1462b6000e320fc7/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/22372)soon to rethink both the structure and copy of the question pages, potentially combining them. 

**Details**

* Several participants thought the question asking if they wanted to apply for benefits for a primary caregiver was "repetitive" and unnecessary - they felt like they already answered that question by applying to the program.

* One participant thought the "learn more" components were the questions themselves and answered “no” to both primary and secondary questions because she didn’t feel like she needed to “learn more.” She eventually figured it out on her own when she got the error message, but she struggled

* One participant specifically said that she wanted the primary and secondary questions on a single page, with more explanation: *"Maybe if there is a way to have primary and secondary together to explain the differences so I know right off the bat what I'm applying for"  *

* One participant wasn’t sure if adding a secondary caregiver was mandatory

* Multiple participants expressed that they needed more information about what a Secondary Caregiver is. 

## **Veteran Medical Facility Page**

**TLDR;** The medical facility page continues to cause confusion for participants, [as discovered in other usability studies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/1010cg-mvp/Usability%20Study-Sign%20as%20Representative-%20February%202021/research-findings.md). Specifically, the first question asking where the veteran most recently received medical care caused issues.

**Recommendation:** Write a ticket to address the issues on this page. See if there is a way we can remove the first question from the form (It is currently not a required section). If not, provide clarity into why we need it and better copy / options.

**Details**

* One participant didn’t understand the reasoning behind why this question was being asked and felt like it was confusing and unnecessary. *"When it comes to Recent medical care- what's the reason behind that? What does where the veteran is receiving medical care have to do with the caregiver application?"*

* Several participants didn’t know how to answer the "most recent medical care" question because their veteran received different types of care and they weren’t sure which type the caregiver program was interested in

* Several participants didn’t know if they should answer "clinic" or “hospital” in the dropdown

* One participant couldn’t find their facility in the dropdown for where the veteran plans to receive care.

* One chose a location that was quite far from her in the *"closest major city."*

## **Other Findings**

* Many Caregivers live with the Veteran, in the future it might be nice to consider having a checkbox to select same address to avoid writing the same thing twice.

* Several caregivers said they typically put their own contact information in for the veteran’s contact information

* "Learn more about who qualifies as a Primary/Secondary Caregiver"

    * The same people are listed for both, thus does not help people understand the difference between Primary and Secondary.

    * The "Learn more" list does not match the list in the dropdown when selecting the relation of Caregiver to Veteran.

* One participant expressed concern about the Social Security number showing fully both when filling out the form and on the Review page. (Often uses public computers)
