## Research Goals 

The goals of this user research study are to: 

- Validate the usability of the updated representative workflow.
- Test the usability of the "upload a document" content and understand what types of documents the user would upload.
- Determine if the cognitive understanding of Primary Family Caregiver versus Secondary Family Caregivers is improved.

## Research Methodology 

We conducted 5 remote moderated usability sessions via Zoom using the Perigean contract. This method allowed us to conduct a task-based usability test in staging to assess if Caregivers and Veterans can easily navigate through the sign as a representative workflow.

### Who we talked to

- 1 Veteran who has a Primary Caregiver
- 1 Veteran who is also a Primary Caregiver (assists husband who is a Veteran) 
- 3 Primary Caregivers 

- Gender:
  - Female: 5

- Device used during study:
  - Mobile: 1
  - Desktop: 4

- Age:
  - 25-34: 2
  - 35-44: 1
  - Unknown: 2 

- Education:
  - Some college (no degree): 1
  - Master's degree: 3
  - Unknown: 1

- Geographic locations:
  - Urban: 3
  - Rural: 2


### Research Questions

The research questions we sought to address: 

- Are users confused by any particular aspect of the representative workflow?
- Does the current representative workflow stop users from completing the form?
- Do the changes to the Primary Family Caregiver versus Secondary Family Caregivers display improve or hinder understanding?
- What types of documents does the user plan to upload?

## Key Findings

1. The redesigned "question page" where participants answer if they want to upload documentation overall worked well, participants were much more comfortable moving through it [than in the previous round of testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/1010cg-mvp/Usability%20Study-Sign%20as%20Representative-%20February%202021/research-findings.md)
2. On the document "question page, participants wanted more guidance about what "counted" as a representative document, and would have liked more details and examples.
3. The upload document page was fairly self-explanatory to most users. Participants who said they were representatives said they would have their documentation readily available.
4. The redesigned signature page caused confusion and wrong information (name) input.
5. The questions to add a primary or secondary caregiver still caused confusion with participants - the new language did seem to help a little bit ([no one confused the question with primary care physician, as in the past test, for example](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/1010cg-mvp/Usability%20Study-Sign%20as%20Representative-%20February%202021/research-findings.md)), but it wasn’t perfect.
6. The medical facility page continues to cause confusion for participants, [as discovered in other usability studies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/1010cg-mvp/Usability%20Study-Sign%20as%20Representative-%20February%202021/research-findings.md). Specifically, the first question asking where the veteran most recently received medical care caused issues. 


## Details of Findings

### The redesigned "question page" where participants answer if they want to upload documentation overall worked well, participants were much more comfortable moving through it [than in the previous round of testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/1010cg-mvp/Usability%20Study-Sign%20as%20Representative-%20February%202021/research-findings.md)
Because the question now centers around asking to upload legal representative documents or not, it did not create a barrier for those participants who did not have Power of Attorney (POA) documents or POA itself. 

### On the document "question page," participants wanted more guidance about what "counted" as a representative document, and would have liked more details and examples. 
On the document "question page," one participant who has a Medical POA answered "Yes" and two participants who have a Medical POA answered "No".

- “Probably say no because I wouldn't know what it is asking for...Would it need to be the VA's version of this? or POA of all things? I have Medical POA through the VA.” 

- “Does a Medical POA count?"

### The upload document page was fairly self-explanatory to most users. Participants who said that they are representatives said they would have their documentation readily available.

- “I would upload this document right now. I have all of this saved on Google drive and could screenshot it or download pdf (if on phone). I think most Caregivers I know have this document on hand.” 

- “I fill out a lot of forms on mobile. I can access my documents with Google Drive."

### The redesigned signature page caused confusion and wrong information (name) input.
 One participant who saw the representative box signed the Veteran’s name instead of her own when it asked for the Representative’s signature. Another participant found it strange that she was being asked to enter her name twice on the signature page (once as Representative, once as Primary Caregiver). Another participant hesitated slightly at the Representative’s signature box, and asked if she would sign the Veteran’s name or her own, before deciding to sign with her own name.

- “If I'm the Primary Caregiver, why am I reading and certifying twice? I would scratch all of that. I'm either giving consent for myself or on behalf of my Veteran. Or there is a random third party?"
- “Would I sign his (Veteran's) name? I would sign mine, right? I've always been told to sign my name for him." 

###  The question to add a primary or secondary caregiver still caused confusion with participants - the new language did seem to help a little bit ([no one confused the question with primary care physician, as in the past test, for example](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/1010cg-mvp/Usability%20Study-Sign%20as%20Representative-%20February%202021/research-findings.md)), but it wasn’t perfect.

- "Seems like this is repetitive, as I already clicked the link to apply."
- *In regards to Primary Caregiver question:* "If you're having someone apply for caregiver, of course you are applying for the benefits. Why else apply or be recognized? *In regards to Secondary Family Caregiver:* "Maybe if there is a way to have Primary and Secondary together to explain the differences so I know right off the bat what I'm applying for. I don't know if everyone gets a Secondary Caregiver."
- *In regards to Secondary Family Caregiver:* "Is this for an additional Caregiver or am I called a Secondary Caregiver?" *Opened the more info accordion and seemed to understand the difference, but confused as to why this question is on the Primary Caregiver application:* "Maybe should have a second application for Secondary Caregiver."

### The medical facility page continues to cause confusion for participants, [as discovered in other usability studies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/1010cg-mvp/Usability%20Study-Sign%20as%20Representative-%20February%202021/research-findings.md). Specifically, the first question asking where the veteran most recently received medical care caused issues.
- "Which kind, Primary Care? Specialty?"
- "When it comes to recent medical care- What's the reason behind that? What does where the veteran is receiving medical care have to do with the Caregiver application? The VA already has access to this information. That doesn't affect the Caregiver role/eligibility. Do I put in physical therapy or VA or telehealth? The clinic connection (VA facility) seems relevant- those are the people that call you. That makes sense because the coordinator is the one who helps with this application."


## Additional Insights
* Many Caregivers live with the Veteran and/or use their contact information in place of the Veteran's, in the future it might be nice to consider having a checkbox to select the same address, phone, and email to avoid writing the same thing twice.

* Learn more about who qualifies as a Primary/Secondary Caregiver (additional info component)

    * The same people (relations) are listed for both Primary and Secondary, thus this does not help people understand the difference.

    * The list does not match the dropdown list that the user must use to select the relationship of Caregiver to Veteran.

* One participant expressed concern about the Social Security number showing fully on the Review page as she often uses public computers.
    * "I would close it (review accordion) immediately if I saw my Social Security number and address appear on the screen."

## Recommendations
* Implement upload documentation question into the workflow

* Add additional content/example to help users understand what qualifies as a legal representative document

* Explore more options for the signature page

In the future
* Keep the new language for Primary/Secondary Caregiver, but improve the user experience by rethinking both the structure and copy of the question pages, potentially combining them and adding additional information about what each role entails and what the benefits are for each.
* Consider putting medical facilities question on their own page or clarifying language about what is required or optional.

## Next Steps

* Upload page
  - Implement copy tweaks

* Explore options for the representative signature box
