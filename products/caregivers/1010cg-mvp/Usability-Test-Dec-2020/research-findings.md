## Research Goals 

The goals of this usability study are to:

Determine whether or not the updated designs of the 10-10CG form are usable, understandable, and easy navigate for Veterans and caregivers.


## Research Methodology 

A task-based remote, moderated usability study was conducted via GoToMeeting between December 16 - December 18, 2020. A moderator began with introduction questions and prompted users with questions (from the conversation guide). Participants were encouraged to talk through their exploration of the 10-10CG. Remote observers and note takers were also in attendance.

### Who we talked to

- 3 Veterans
  - 1 Veteran with PTSD 
  - 1 Veteran with TBI 

- 1 Veteran who is also a caregiver
- 9 Caregivers

- Geographically diverse (DE, VA, IN, TX, NM, IA, NY, FL, SC)

- Ages of our participants ranged from 25 to 65+

  - 1 participant under 35
  - 6 participants 35 - 44
  - 1 participant 45 - 54
  - 4 participants 55 - 64
  - 1 participant over 65


### Research Questions

- Are users able to achieve their goal of either applying with a:

  - Primary Family Caregiver
  - Primary Family Caregiver and Secondary Family Caregiver(s)
  - Secondary Family Caregiver(s) only
  
 *Note: Only two participants applied with a Secondary Family Caregiver 

- Is there any confusion caused by the content or verbiage in regards to the Primary Family Caregiver and Secondary Family Caregiver workflows?

- Will confusion be caused in any way by the addition of the Primary Family Caregiver question?

## Key Findings

1. Though there was some confusion, most participants were able to get through the caregiver flows with the correct information filled in
2. A few participants were confused by the wording of the Primary Family Caregiver question (i.e. Would you like to add a Primary Family Caregiver?) 
3. The placement and content of the additional info component confused some participants (i.e. What’s a Primary Family Caregiver?/What’s a Secondary Family Caregiver?)
4. Those that wanted to apply with only a secondary caregiver struggled somewhat
5. Some participants found who can become a Secondary Family Caregiver and their role unclear

## Details of Findings

**1.Though there was some confusion, most participants were able to get through the caregiver flows with the correct information filled in.** Overall, participants were able to navigate and complete the form correctly - filling the appropriate sections. One participant stated, “I cannot believe this is this easy, it just seems like I'm missing something. This was so easy to do. Why did I wait a year to do this?” However, there was some uncertainty over the addition of the Primary Family Caregiver question, knowing if a Veteran or caregiver should add a Primary Family Caregiver/Secondary Family Caregiver, and eligibility requirements (discussed in the following). Two participants completed the form focused on Secondary Family Caregiver only. 


**2. A few participants were confused by the wording of the Primary Family Caregiver question.** A few participants tried to enter their health care provider information in the Primary Family Caregiver fields. Relating the word “Primary” and “Caregiver” to medical professionals. One participant stated, “I misread it. I thought it said primary care doctor or physician. But I just blew through it.” Another participant added, "My primary caregiver is, that would be my doctor, right?"

Some participants found the word “family” unclear for the Primary Family Caregiver and Secondary Family Caregiver questions, Ultimately, leading to questions around eligibility. Questions like, “Can it be a buddy?” surfaced. One Caregiver stated, “There's a lot of homeless Veterans who don't have anyone, and a lot of people who don't have family... so friends would have to help them.”

**3. The placement and content of the additional info component confused some participants (e.g. What’s a Primary Family Caregiver?/What’s a Secondary Family Caregiver?).**  A few participants seemed to “skip over” the question, “Would you like to add a Primary Family Caregiver?” Focusing instead on the “additional information” component, “What’s a Primary Family Caregiver?” This acted as a pain point for some participants who could not answer the question easily and accurately.


**4. Those that wanted to apply with only a secondary caregiver struggled somewhat.** One participant hesitated on the Primary Family Caregiver page before finding the needed information within the “Additional info” component and proceeding with the form. They said, “Well at first it confused me, I wasn’t sure if it was asking for a secondary caregiver...I was confused by the question, but then once I went on it was very clear and once I said No it was very clear.” Another participant found it unclear if they needed to re-enter their information in the Primary Family Caregiver sections before proceeding to the Secondary Family Caregiver fields.

**5. Some participants found who can become a Secondary Family Caregiver and their role unclear.** Participants had questions around the requirements for a Secondary Family Caregiver. Some participants found the eligibility and required relationship between Secondary Family Caregiver and Veteran vague. “Can my mother-in-law be a Secondary Family Caregiver? She lives out of state.” Other participants were unsure of the Secondary Family Caregiver’s role. “I guess I don’t understand this designation. I know for a backup but don’t know if for example… does a secondary act as a backup? Are they already cleared and ready to go and they just fill in immediately?”


## Additional Insights

- **The medical facility page caused difficulty for some participants.** Veteran’s receive care at multiple locations and some participants were unsure which to enter. A participant stated, “he goes to different facilities every week...I would probably put the hospital that's the last place he talked to...I'd guess the last place he went. Yesterday he went to 2 different clinics.”

Additionally, the last received medical treatment question caused confusion for some participants. For some participants, it was unclear if they should list a VA facility or community care. One participant stated, “Is that the doctor I went to or is that the VA hospital I went to? Is that a hospital or a clinic? I’m not sure if it’s VA or any place.”

Some participants found the two questions to be unnecessary. “Because it's a medical facility... It's the same question that just kind of turned around. Those are the little things that frustrate the veteran on using things on the computer. It's redundant.” Another added, “VA medical center AGAIN, we've already answered that.”

- **Caregiver’s would complete the form on behalf of the Veteran. Additionally, participants would often enter the Caregiver’s phone and email in the appropriate Veteran’s fields.** One participant noted, “I would list my phone number first and the Veteran’s phone second so they would have all of that. When the VA calls, they would be calling someone that would most likely answer and help with the care. If they did need to speak directly with my husband, I can also facilitate that much easier than them reaching out to him directly.”

- **Participants that triggered the error found it odd that there was no way to resubmit application online.** A participant said, “there should be an option to re-submit it online. You should be able to review your errors without having to worry about downloading something. If you are the caregiver, you really don’t have any extra time to worry about downloading something and trying to print it.”

- **Some participants expressed the desire to easily indicate the caregiver address is the same as the Veteran’s address.** A participant noted, “For address it should say “same as above”, why do we have to put in all this extra information? If it is redundant, why can’t we just say, “same as Veteran” and all this information populate?” 

- **Some participants expressed the desire to have a another option for sex/gender.** One participant said, “Only having 2 options here as male and female as things progress I would have an ‘other’ radio button here…”

- **The importance of mobile first design was validated.** The amount of scrolling increased on mobile may have caused a participant to miss the How to Apply button. The dropdowns are a challenge on mobile devices. Printing and saving confirmation are difficult on a mobile device. One user noted, “there’s no way on mobile devices to save this document and send it to yourself once you complete this.”

- **One participant expressed the desire to sign as a representative/POA for the Veteran.** The participant said, “I just like to be transparent about who is communicating...I’m always documenting when it is me doing something on his behalf...This isn’t always recognized by the VA especially if it’s medical versus financial. It would literally be me typing for him. If it wouldn’t let me have this sort of disclaimer here.”

- **One participants questioned the placement (within the form) of the question, “Would you like to add a Primary Family Caregiver?”** The location (following the Veteran information/before caregiver information) of the “Would you like to add a Primary Family Caregiver?” question caused some confusion. The participant said, “Well if I'm applying for it, I’m not sure why they would ask... I've already answered and read about that in the beginning. I probably wouldn't know why I'm being asked that. It doesn't seem useful. It seems odd to put it there. I would hope I know already if I'm applying to be one.”

- **Some participants had issues locating the green How to Apply or Start your application buttons.** 

- **Participants found the respondent burden helpful. Several users had experience previously with the paper form. Participants generally thought the online experience was simple and easy to use.**


## Recommendations

- Consider changes to the placement and design of “Would you like to add a Primary Family Caregiver?” page
  - Add clear, plain language content explaining who can act as a Primary Family Caregiver and Secondary Family Caregiver
- Update content in “Additional info” components to “Learn more about Primary Family Caregiver” and “Learn more about Secondary Family Caregiver”
- Iterate on medical facility page - Enable the user to enter the medical facility information confidently and correctly
- (Re)explore allowing resubmission when error is triggered 


## Next Steps

**Present findings to the VA.gov Caregiver team**
- Share out insights with team (1/7/21). Get input and insights on recommendations
- Share with Caregiver program team (1/8/21) 
**Make changes to design based on usability findings and content feedback**

**Use recommendations to guide designs moving forward**
