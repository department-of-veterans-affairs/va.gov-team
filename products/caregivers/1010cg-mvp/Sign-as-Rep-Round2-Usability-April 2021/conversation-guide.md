## Project-Specific Setup and Intro - 10 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Shawna/Dené and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to review a prototype about VA benefits that are provided to caregivers of Veterans.

- This entire session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- You'll be interacting with a a demo tool. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- Please talk aloud as you're looking through things. For example, say "now I'd click on this.. what's this?" This helps me understand what's going through your head while using the tool.
- To protect your privacy, we are not going to use your real name or Social Security Number today. Feel free to make-up a name, birthday, SSN...I can always provide that information if you want
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

**Talk them through Zoom screen sharing and chat features.


**I'm going to send you a link in the chat.**
_ I actually do this as I’m explaining to them where to find “Chat” and “Share,” so by the end I’m looking at their screen, then I move onto recording._

Desktop [include link or links]
Open staging link in another tab

**Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:**

- Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "Drive". You will tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok?
- [Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen?


**Recording Instructions**

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording to the Cloud.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?"** 

Great. Now we're really ready to begin!

## Applying for benefits task with first representative option - 15 minutes

Now that I understand a little bit more about your background. 

**For Veterans:**

Let's say you heard about a way you and your caregiver could receive benefits from the VA, and that you could apply online at VA.gov. You have navigated to the screen we are looking at. Now let's imagine you've decided you'd like to apply for these benefits. Go ahead and show us what you would do to apply. 

**For Caregivers:**

Let's say you heard about a way you could receive benefits from the VA, and that you could apply online at VA.gov. You have navigated to the screen we are looking at. Now let's imagine you've decided you'd like to apply for these benefits. Go ahead and show us what you would do to apply. 

Things to watch for:

In general, we want to sit back and watch them, but if they hesitate you can say “I noticed you hesitate here, what are you thinking?”

- Remind participants to think out loud. 
- Any hiccups? Do they know all the information?
- Any fields trip them up?
- Anything particularly confusing for them?
- Pay close attention to the representative and document upload sections 
  - What documents would you upload here?
  - Do the upload instructions make sense to you?
  - Do you already have a digital copy of the documents? (explain what this means if necessary)
  - How do you usually create a digital copy of your paper documents? (prompt with personal scanner, photo, local office store, etc. if hesitation)
- Make sure to dig in when there's any hesitation into what they are thinking
- Any confusion understanding primary and secondary caregivers?

## Post task questions - 10 minutes

Wonderful! I have a few questions about what you just saw in the prototype.

**Overall 

- What did you think of the overall experience in completing this form?
- What was the hardest part of completing the form? Were there any areas you felt were unclear? 
- What worked well? 

**Representative 

- I'm going to quickly show you my screen (moderator shares screen with “representative” question)
   - Can you tell me how you decided/knew that you were/weren’t a representative?
   - _If they were confused when completing this section._ What could we do to improve the information around representatives? 
   - Can you elaborate on your reasoning for your selection?
- _If not addressed in tasks_ 
  -  What documents would you upload here?
  -  Would you have them on hand? 
  
 -If the legal representative is the same as the primary caregiver, statement of truth boxes that they are signing? (have signature page ready) 

## Wrap-up questions - 5 minutes
