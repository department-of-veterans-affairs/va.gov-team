# [DRAFT] Research Plan: VSA Caregiver, 10-10CG facility selection redesign usability testing and upload error message checkup, August 2021

## Background
This research is to be conducted on the Application for Family Caregiver Benefits (10-10CG) by the Caregivers team.

During previous usability studies on this form (Research Findings: [February 2021](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/1010cg-mvp/Usability%20Study-Sign%20as%20Representative-%20February%202021/research-findings.md), [April 2021](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/1010cg-mvp/Sign-as-Rep-Round2-Usability-April%202021/research%20findings.md)) we have found the VA medical facility selection page caused many users confusion. A few trends in confusion include:
1. Users are confused why the facility they are familiar with isn't listed. (The current dropdown list only includes facilities with a Caregiver support staff)
2. Users are uncertain which facility to specify (Eg. Primary care, therapist, oncologist, most recent, etc.)
3. Users that live on state borders potentially would have to select a different state from where they live in order to find their preferred facility (located in another state).

We have redesigned the page to address these needs and this research is on the usability of this redesign. 

Additionally, we have recently released a new upload error message/flow. The usability of this error will be tested as a secondary goal of this research.

## Goals	

The goals of this user research are to:
1. Determine whether or not this facility redesign is usable 
2. Determine whether or not this facility redesign is accessible
3. Determine whether or not this facility redesign resolves the confusion trends listed above
4. Determine whether or not the error message on file upload is usable and easily worked through

**Research questions**

1. Are users able to navigate through facility selection without difficulty?
2. Do users understand what they are selecting?
3. Do users understand how the postal code was pre-populated?
4. Can users easily change the text input and understand what choices are populated from that search?
5. Do users understand "no facility found" error and can easily work through it?
6. Can users easily work through an error message on file upload?


**Hypotheses**

Our hypothesis is that users will be able to navigate through the facility selection relatively easily, but may have issues with the following:
- The amount of results shown
- Filtering results by miles away
- Not recognizing the name of the facility they are looking for

Our hypothesis is that users will be able to navigate through file upload error messages relatively easily, but may have issues with the following:
- Not understanding how to "fix" the file they are uploading

## Method	
**Task analysis**

A task-based usability study will be conducted remotely with Zoom using the Perigean contract. A remote moderator will begin with introduction questions and prompt users with guiding questions (from the conversation guide). Because the facility selection appears near the beginning of the flow, we will have the participant start at the beginning of the application, for context, and then complete specific tasks on the facility selection page, paying special attention to:
- Where does the participant think that the pre-populated postal code came from?
- Can they clear the text input field?
- Do they know what to input in the text field?
- Can they successfully filter by distance?
- When the distance is automatically raised (if no results within specified distance), is this clear to the participant?
- Can users successfully navigate past a "no results" error?
- Can users successfully load more facilities if return is greater than 5?
- Can users work through an error upon file upload?

Participants will be encouraged to talk through their exploration of the prototype.

We will be testing with a coded form in staging on desktop and mobile. Remote observers and note takers will be in attendance.



## Participants and Recruitment	
We would like to work with Perigean to recruit for 8-10 fulfilled remote sessions. Therefore, we request that 15 sessions be scheduled.

**Must have for participants**

All participants must:

- At least 5 Veterans
- At least 3 POAs
- At least 5 people who plan to use their computer for the session
- At least 5 people who plan to use their smartphone for the session
- At least 1 person who uses a screen reader
- Have access to a laptop/desktop or smartphone/tablet and be willing to complete the test on said laptop/desktop/smartphone/tablet
- Participants must be able to use Zoom, locate and use the chat function in Zoom, and to share their screen through Zoom


**Participant pool should strive for the following breakdown**

- Age: 
     - over age 55: 50%  
     - age 18-30: 25%  
     - age 31-50: 25%  


**Participant pool should in diverse in**
- Branch of service
- Gender (30% or more women)
- Disability rating of 50% or higher representative of applicant demographics
- Education
- Race
- Geography
- Density (rural)
