# Conversation Guide for Caregiver Research Study

## Moderator logistics

*Use [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.*

*Before the session, send out the [observer instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/during-research/howto-observer-instructions.md) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into #feedback-backchannel).*

*In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute*

*In the Audio section, click the drop-down arrow and make sure "Play Entry/Exit Chimes" is unchecked*

*Check your [screensharing setup]*

*When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

### Project-specific setup

- Open [10-10CG form](https://staging.va.gov/caregivers/introduction) in a new tab 
- Have  [10-10CG prototype] (https://staging.va.gov/caregivers/introduction) available in another tab
- Be prepared to screen share in case of technical difficulties 

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Jonathan and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about federal benefits that are provided to family members or caregivers of disabled veterans. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- **You'll be interacting with prototypes and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

- **Please talk aloud as you're looking through things.** . For example say "now I'd click on this.. what's this?" This helps me understand what's going through your head while using the tool. 

- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 

    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Before we start the activities I mentioned, I'd like to ask a few questions about yourself. 

- Can you tell me a little about yourself? (If stuck, ask about location, occupation, etc.)

- For Caregivers:

   - Are you currently receiving benefits from the VA’s Program for Family Caregivers? 

   - Are there any other family members / caregivers of the veteran?

   - Do you currently live with your veteran?

   - Do you receive any other benefits from the VA?

- For Veterans:

  - Do you currently have caregivers? Are they currently receiving benefits from the VA’s Program for Family Caregivers? 

 - How many caregivers do you have?

 - Do you currently live with any of your caregivers?

 - Does your caregiver receive benefits from the VA?

Great! Thanks for sharing all of that with me.  Let's get started. 

## First Task: [First impressions / thoughts] - 5 minutes

- Moderator sends link to https://staging.va.gov/caregivers/introduction to participant and asks them to share their screen (note moderator should have backup open on their own computer to share in case veteran can't figure out sharing)
 
- Now we are going to look at the form for the caregiver application. You've found the location of the form and landed on this page. (moderator chats link of form to participant, makes sure still is sharing screen) What are your first impressions? What information would it take to complete this form? How do you know?  Which parts were most useful on this page?

## Second Task: [Filling out the form] - 15 minutes

- Now let's say you've decided you'd like to apply for these benefits. Go ahead and show us what you would do to apply 

### Things to watch for:

- Any hiccups? Do they know all the information?
- Any fields trip them up?
- Anything particularly confusing for them?
- Make sure to dig in when there's any hesitation into what they are thinking
- If anyone has / is a secondary caregiver, make sure they notice and complete that section

## Third Task: [understanding next steps] - 5 minutes

- Now that you submitted the form, what do you think are the next steps in this process? How do you know?  Which parts were most useful on this page?

What do you expect to see if you successfully submitted the form? 

What do you expect to see if for some reason you were not able to submit the form? 

What would be helpful on the confirmation page? 

 

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

Great.

- What do you think was the hardest part of that process?
- What worked well?
- Would you fill out the paper form with your veteran/caregiver? What about the online form?
- Any questions for me? 

## Review potential features - 10 minutes

Before wrapping up, I’d like to discuss some potential new features to the Caregiver form.

- Is there anything missing that would be valuable to you? Why are these important to you? 

Potential features for the Caregiver form: 

- Attaching Power of Attorney
- Print button of filled out 10-10CG form (PDF) 
- Login (save in progress) 
- Portal to check status of application, etc 
- Are we missing anything? 

### Things to watch for:

-   How confident is the participant when listing the items they'd want to see?
-   How does the participant respond to "why" each item is important?
-   What elaboration did the participant give (if any) on what information they expect to see in a particular item?
-   How did the pre-populated cards resonate with the participant?
-   Which items is the participant most confident they'd be interested in?
-   Do any items cause the participant to hesitate?


## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
