# Vets-api retries - ultimate failures

In the summer of 2022, the 10-10 Health Apps team is implementing the retry capability, so that vets-api can retry calling MuleSoft when there is a response _other than_ status codes `201` or `202`.

<details>
     <Summary>More details on codes from MuleSoft</Summary>

>Mule application will only generate 201 or 202 when it was able either:
>- Process Message
>- Queue message to SFDC
>- Create a DTC ticket
>
>Mule will never generate any other code if it is functional.
>
>VA.GOV needs to retry if:
>- It can’t connect to Mule and get 5xx error
>- The connection timed out after 5 minutes and Mule did not respond
>
>In the event that MuleSoft fails to return a successful response within a given timeframe, there is an alternative process in place to ensure that the application is >sent to the Caregiver teams without further intervention from the applicant.

### Procedure
- An early alert is triggered by having >5 application submissions with 3+ retries over a period of 10 hours, posted to the Slack Channel **#health-tools-1010-apm**
     - The 10-10 Health Apps team will begin a review of the failures
     - The 10-10 Health Apps team will determine if a "maintenance" banner be in place to stop further applications from being submitted and failing
     - Once the 10-10 Health Apps team's review determines that the MuleSoft team needs to be involved, an update will be posted to the Slack channel **vecms-carma_vadotgov_development_external** and an email will be sent to the audience below:
          - Patrick Bateman
          - Heather Justice
          - 1010_team@agile6.com
          - VACARMAOperationsTeam@va.gov
          - DTCMulesoftSupport@va.gov
     - Once the coordination begins, the teams can determine whether to start the process of retrieving failed PDF documents to send via an encrypted email to **vha12cspcarmaehr@va.gov** for manual processing

- After 1 day of failed retries (~25 hours), any alerts will be posted to the Slack Channel **#health-tools-1010-apm**.  The alerts will also be emailed to the audience below:
     - Patrick Bateman
     - Heather Justice
     - VACARMAOperationsTeam@va.gov
     - DTCMulesoftSupport@va.gov


- Upon receiving the alert and determining that we have a catastrophic failure, the 10-10 Health Apps team will retrieve the PDF application file from the Production environment.  This PDF will be sent via an encrypted email to **vha12cspcarmaehr@va.gov**, including the timestamp of the submission from VA.gov.  The team will also request that a "maintenance" banner be in place to stop further applications from being submitted and failing.  


- The 10-10 Health Apps team will post all updates in the Slack channel **vecms-carma_vadotgov_development_external**.
     - 10-10 Health Apps team to notify channel of alert being received, tagging the channel with “@here”
     - 10-10 Health Apps team to notify audience of PDF being sent via an encrypted email to CSP at **vha12cspcarmaehr@va.gov**
     - 10-10 Health Apps team to notify audience of the 'Maintenance" banner set in place to stop access to the online application
     - 10-10 Health Apps team to assist with any triage to resolve failures causing retry expiration
