| Participants moved through the "who will sign" selection without friction, and didn't indicate a likelihood of abandonment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Sign as rep - Round 3                                                          |
| Some participants thought it would help them make a selection if the types of documents accepted/ not accepted were listed on the "who will sign" question page.<br>a. Participants were happy to see that the accepted/not accepted documents is included in the following "document upload" page.                                                                                                                                                                       | Sign as rep - Round 3                                                          |
| Participants that did choose to sign as a representative moved through the document upload page without friction, and didn't indicate a likelihood of abandonment.<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Sign as rep - Round 3                                                          |
| The updated copy that appears after the document upload is well-received. Participants didn't indicate any negative feelings, but rather appreciated the reminder.<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Sign as rep - Round 3                                                          |
| All participants recognized that the "who will sign" question has direct relationship to the signature of the application.<br>a. This also resulted in improved clarity once reaching the signature section                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Sign as rep - Round 3                                                          |
| One participant brought up a security concern about how will the VA know if someone just signs the Veteran's name.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Sign as rep - Round 3                                                          |
| The medical facility page continues to cause confusion for participants, as discovered in other usability studies. Specifically, the first question asking where the veteran most recently received medical care caused issues.<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Sign as rep - Round 3, Sign-as-Rep Round2 Usability, Usability Testing 2020-01 |
| The Primary/Secondary Caregiver selection continues to cause confusion to participants                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Sign as rep - Round 3, Sign-as-Rep Round2 Usability, Usability Testing 2020-01 |
| Many Caregivers live with the Veteran and/or use their contact information in place of the Veteran's, in the future it might be nice to consider having a checkbox to select the same address, phone, and email to avoid writing the same thing twice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Sign as rep - Round 3, Sign-as-Rep Round2 Usability                            |
| Participants are uncertain about why the Caregiver is asked if they have insurance and worry that it is a requirement to be in the program. Applicants could benefit if there was an explanation of why this question is asked how it will impact their application.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Sign as rep - Round 3                                                          |
| 3 participants were confused by the "Download VA form 10-10CG(PDF)" link on the introduction page. Two participants thought it was for the POA form (because of the note immediately below the link). One participant thought this was the only way to fill out the 10-10CG and didn't notice the button to start the application (they filled out the PDF from the link when they applied for the program).                                                              | Sign as rep - Round 3                                                          |
| Participants would like the requirements for becoming a primary/secondary caregiver to be more prominent in the introduction, including:<br>Difference and expectations for the role of primary and secondary caregivers<br>That the Veteran must already be enrolled in health care<br>That the caregiver must live with the Veteran (if this is a requirement)<br>What document proves authority to make medical decisions for the Veteran and sign as a representative | Sign as rep - Round 3, Sign-as-Rep Round2 Usability                            |
| One participant expressed concern about the Social Security number showing fully on the Review page as she often uses public computers.<br><br>"I would close it (review accordion) immediately if I saw my Social Security number and address appear on the screen."                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Sign-as-Rep Round2 Usability, Usability Testing 2020-01                        |
