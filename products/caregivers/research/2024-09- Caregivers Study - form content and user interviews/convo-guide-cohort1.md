## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Jessica/Angela] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them, some things I want to mention: 

Today we're going to talk about the application for the **Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers**. We have some questions for you about this and then we would like you to share your screen and go through using the online form. We will use our testing site so you won't be actually submitting an application today. 

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic to keep us on schedule.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem; just let me know.
- **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers.
   - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
   - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
   - Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
- **Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ and Caregivers' experiences?** In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.
   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**


## Warm-up Interview Questions - 10 minutes

Before we look at the caregiver program online form, let’s start with a few warm-up questions about your [caregiver/Veteran] application experience.

## First Task: [Introduction page] - 5 minutes

- Thank you for sharing that background. Now let's change gears a bit.

- This is our testing site so you don't have to worry about the information that you enter going anywhere. Feel free to use fake information for sensitive items such as your social or birth date that you don't want to share.
- As you go through the form please remember to think aloud. We want to hear about any reactions you're having.

- If you saw something you entered by mistake, show me how you would go about correcting that.
- What's your comfort level filling out and signing this information without all the people involved present?

- Describe to me in your own words what this page is telling you happened and what comes next in this process.

- If you had a magic wand and you were in a perfect world, what would you like to see here?

**Participant ratings:**

Thank you for that feedback, I am going to stop sharing my screen now and wrap up with a couple final questions.

- What research would you do before applying and completing a form like this?
- What are your thoughts on the amount of information provided in this form? Did you think it was too much, just enough, or too little?
- Is there any additional information about who qualifies as a primary and secondary caregiver that you would've liked to see?
- [Prompt if needed: For example, would it be helpful to you to see eligibility information about the program when applying vs before-hand?]



## Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners, removing any information that could be used to identify you?**
   - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?


## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today! Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans and for Caregivers too.

Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
