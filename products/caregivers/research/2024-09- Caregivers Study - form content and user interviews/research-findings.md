## Research Goals
1. Learn more about a caregiver's understanding of the PCAFC program before filling out the 10-10CG to determine if recent content updates have improved comprehension of the program and if additional content changes would be helpful at this stage in the caregiver journey.
2. Learn more about the overall experience of multiple people completing one form.
3. Evaluate the usability of the new facility search functionality and confirmation screen content.


## Research Questions
* Learn more about a caregiver's understanding of the PCAFC program before filling out the 10-10CG to determine if recent content updates have improved comprehension of the program and if additional content changes would be helpful at this stage in the caregiver journey.
    * What knowledge of the caregiver program do Veterans and caregivers typically have before filling out the 10-10CG?
    * How do caregivers, both primary and secondary, perceive the existing form content with regards to understanding eligibility and benefits, and where would additional clarification be helpful?
    * Do users struggle with completing any fields in particular? We'll be especially paying attention to how users react to the new "County" field and social security number requirements.
    * Is there a need or desire for applicants to have an authenticated experience that pre-fills personal information?

* Learn more about the overall experience of multiple people completing one form.
    * Who typically completes the form online? Are Veterans and their caregivers signing the form together?
    * For those who are enrolled, did they sign as a legal representative and what was that experience like?
    * Are there places in the form where users get confused by the content switching point of view between the Veteran and various caregiver roles and/or who "you" refers to in the form questions?
    * Do users correctly notice when labels for form fields are asking for a specific person's information?
   
* Evaluate the usability of the new facility search functionality and confirmation screen content.
    * Can sighted and assistive tech users easily use the search input and understand what choices are populated from that search?
    * Can users easily navigate a long list of search results?
    * Can users easily do a second search or new search from the search results page?
    * Is the new facility selection pattern easy for the participant to understand why they are selecting a facility and how it impacts the caregiver application process?
    * How do users react to their facility selection on the confirmation page?

## Methodology 
We conducted remote moderated usability studies via Zoom from October 1 - 18, 2014 using the VA.gov staging environment for the 10-10CG starting at the form introduction page. This enabled us to test the form without any risk of applications being submitted in production, test with accessible technology users, and test updates to the facility selection step that were not yet in production.

We recruited 2 cohorts of participants:

* Caregivers - Cohort 1 (completed 13 of 22 scheduled sessions)
* Veterans - Cohort 2 (completed 7 of 12 scheduled sessions and 1 external pilot participant)


## Hypotheses and Conclusions

**Hypothesis 1:** We assume there is missing helpful information for caregiver applicants around what they are eligible for and what benefits they get. We think this study will inform content changes we should make as a result to increase clarity of the caregiver program within the form.

* Definitely True
* A key finding was that over half of participants called out wanting to know if they were eligible and for what exactly before they would complete the form. 
* Participants wanted more information pertaining to the difference between secondary and primary caregiver benefits. There was repeated confusion about what a secondary caregiver is and what the benefits are of being one.

**Hypothesis 2:** We assume there are a variety of dyad applicant combos and those groups most often have pain points around the personal information and signing handoff process. We anticipate it might be easier if each applicant could complete their own personal information and sign independently.

* Likely True
* A key finding was that Veterans and Caregivers had mixed comfortability about signing for others if they were not there in person. This varied by personal preference and applicant combos. 
* 9 out of 13 Caregivers and 3 out of 8 Veterans were comfortable signing the form for people not physically present
* 4 out of 13 Caregivers and 5 out of 8 Veterans were not comfortable or unsure of signing for people not physically present
* We found that Caregivers were more comfortable and prepared to complete the form themselves than Veterans.
    * 7 of 13 Caregivers said they would have all the necessary information for the Veteran and secondary caregivers on-hand.
    * 7 Caregivers and 2 Veterans expressed that they would pause to contact the people they were signing the form for or wait until they could be present, and 2 participants specifically mentioned wanting to save the form and come back to it.
    * 7 of 8 Veterans would want at least 1 other caregiver present/in person to submit the application.

**Hypothesis 3:** Based on what we know about the caregiver journey, we assume that all applicants have multiple other VA touch points and forms completed which gives them a general understanding of the caregiver program and benefits before completing the 10-10CG.

* Likely False
* The majority of participants found information about the caregiver program before applying on VA.gov, through word of mouth from other Veterans and Caregivers, and through their medical providers. VA.gov is the primary place people are looking for a comprehensive description of the program and eligibility criteria.

**Hypothesis 4:** We assume that the county field in the address will create pause and some confusion with participants based on business feedback of applications having a version of USA (country) entered. 

* Maybe True
* There was some pause/confusion around the field and why it was being asked, but overall most participants entered a county correctly. There was new hint text and validation in place before this study went live, and business data has suggested that those changes have reduced the frequency of the issue on the processing end. 
* 11 of 13 Caregivers entered a county correctly
* 2 of 13 Caregivers entered USA initially (one with "United state" variation got through, one corrected after error)
* 7 of 8 Veterans entered correctly/easily 
* 1 of 8 Veterans initially entered USA and received a validation error



## Key Findings

1. Veterans and Caregivers want more clarity on eligibility and benefits before applying.
2. Veterans and Caregivers had mixed comfortability with and ease of signing the form.
3. Users said content was “just enough” but called out items that needed more clarification.
4. The facility search functionality was difficult / confusing for some users.
5. Veterans and Caregivers differ on facilities confirmation page content clarity.


## Details of Findings 

**Finding 1: Veterans and Caregivers want more clarity on eligibility and benefits before applying.**

Labels: TREND: Content 

Both Veterans and Caregivers expressed confusion and frustration with determining exactly what the caregiver program entails, understanding their eligibility status before applying, and wanting more clarity on the benefits of the program.

Out of 21 total participants:

* 11 participants said they would want to know or would check if they are eligible for the program before completing the form.
* 10 participants expressed confusion about the caregiver program and what it entails in general.
* The majority of participants found information about the caregiver program before applying on VA.gov, through word of mouth from other Veterans and Caregivers, and through their medical providers. The website is the primary place people are looking for a comprehensive description of the program and eligibility criteria.

> _P21: "I would want to know right away if I qualify or not - whether to start the form or not."_ <br>

> _P3: "I don't understand the two different types of programs. There's the paid side and the unpaid side (the general, basic program I'm a part of). I wanted to apply for the stipend side. When I was denied (the stipend) I was confused about it. The only thing I could say about applying is trying to understand EXACTLY what I'm applying for, and make it clear there's two sides to the program."_ <br>

> _P12: "I tell you, they keep that Caregivers program a big secret. Anyone you ask they say 'go see this person, go see that person.'"_ <br>


**Finding 2: Veterans and Caregivers had mixed comfortability with and ease of signing the form.**

Labels: DSP: Form feedback; DSP: Ask users for signature 

Veterans and Caregivers were somewhat split on whether they feel comfortable signing the 10-10CG without all parties present, and many participants struggled to sign the form without errors. Caregivers were more comfortable with completing the form alone than Veterans.

* 4 out of 13 Caregivers and 5 out of 8 Veterans were not comfortable or unsure of signing for people not physically present.
* 7 Caregivers and 2 Veterans expressed that they would pause to contact the people they were signing the form for or wait until they could be present, and 2 participants specifically mentioned wanting to save the form and come back to it.
* 5 Caregivers and 2 Veterans got errors when signing the form because what they typed didn't perfectly match the names they entered in the form. For some this was very difficult to correct and trying to determine what was missing was sometimes just a period or a space.

**Supporting behaviors:**

* P7 had trouble signing the form because of discrepancies in upper case and lower case letter and the suffix needed to be exact.
  
* P31 was on mobile and got an error in the signature fields because there was an extra space at the end of two of the signatures. They tried to go back and fix it according to the errors and ultimately weren’t able to get the errors to go away. They said “Okay, I’m stuck.” They tried to refresh the page thinking it was a system issue. It was not clear that the extra space at the end of the names was causing the errors.

**Supporting quotes:**

> _P5: "Oh - he needs to be here now." [When participant saw that the secondary caregiver needs to sign the review page]_ <br>

> _P6: "I don't like this to be honest because anybody could put this information in."_ <br>

> _P34: "It's kind of like with government stuff, you wanna be careful that you're not getting yourself in trouble by doing something and swearing that you're the one that did it." "...Here I would've like to have said it's not the Veteran that's filling it out." [Did not have any documents listed to sign as legal rep]_ <br>


**Finding 3: Users said content was “just enough” but called out items that needed more clarification.**

Labels: TREND: Content, SPG: Blind/Visually Impaired

At the end of the study, we asked participants if they felt the amount of information in the form was “too little", "too much," or "just enough." 

* While 10 out of 13 Caregivers and 6 out of 8 Veterans said the form contained "just enough" information, 14 participants expressed wanting more information about the program and/or primary and secondary caregiver benefits throughout the sessions.
* 9 participants were confused about the requirements and benefits of secondary caregivers in particular.
* 3 participants expressed confusion and/or wanting to know more about the stipend aspect of the caregiver program.
* Both AT participants expressed confusion about ADLs (activities of daily living) and concern that blindness was not listed as an ADL.

**Supporting quotes:**

> _P5: "I'm not gonna apply for a program where I'm gonna get $20 a month."_ <br>

> _P27: "I would hope that the program itself was equitable across the board. In the past, the caregiver program wasn't equitable to the blind. The standards that they were using were standards for sighted people, and not for blind people. They didn't make any distinctions. For example, they ask if you can put food in your mouth, and in case of fire, can you find your way out? Things like that and that's not a question that you would be asking a blind person."_ <br>

> _P22: “I’d be stressed about those two items [facility + secondary caregiver]. It would definitely agitate my stress level. There's no way I'd be submitting this form right now. I'd be clicking the back button and looking for that Need Help thing."_ <br>

**Finding 4: The facility search functionality was difficult and confusing for some users.**

Labels: DSP: Ask users for a single response, DSP: Show more options, PRDT: Facilities

We specifically wanted to test the new facility search functionality in this study. This allows users to type in a zip code, state, city, or facility name and instructs them to select a facility from a list that populates from the search. 
Both Caregivers and Veterans struggled with the search functionality and results. The search button click was often skipped (continue button clicked instead) resulting in errors and the user not understanding why. The search results themselves were also confusing when addresses and facility names did not meet expectations.

* 6 out of 13 caregivers were confused by the facility search results they were provided and expressed that they weren’t what they expected and/or they weren’t initially able to find their facility in the list.
* 4 of 8 Veterans had issues with missing the search button and not initially loading facility results.
* All participants seemed to understand that they should enter the facility where the Veteran receives care.
* The average facility rating by Veterans was 3.75 out of 5 and for Caregivers was 4.33 out of 5.
* 1 Veteran mentioned the facility could be known based off of Veteran ID/SSN.

**Supporting behaviors:**

* P3: Gets error for city, state zip search and decides to redo search with VHA medical center name. This produces search results.

* P14: When going back to do a new search, they were surprised that it didn't retain their original facility selection.

**Supporting quotes:**

> _P14: "This gives the user more agency but it also makes it harder. A lot of people like my dad would say ‘this is too hard, I’ll just go to Tricare.’"_ <br>

> _P32: [Typed in a zip code and hit the Continue button instead of search and got an error. He was confused.] "I would pause on the application until I find out what's going on with it"._ <br>

> _P26: "If Tampa's not enough information, what the hell do I gotta put there?" [mobile, did not click search button]_ <br>

> _P14: "You are asking for the county to bring a care team to the Veteran right? If you have this information already, you could definitely have...an under-the-hood program here that lists facilities that are in a 50 mile or 100 mile radius of that address I typed in." "You're making me do the work when I just gave you a whole bunch of privacy info about us."_ <br>

**Finding 5: Veterans and Caregivers differ on facilities confirmation page content clarity.**

Labels: PRDT: Facilities

In the facility selection step of the form, if the user selects a facility that doesn’t have caregiver support (which is the case for most VA clinics), then they will see a facility confirmation page after their selection that explains that they will be assigned a nearby facility for caregiver support. The confirmation page lists that facility name and address.
About half of Caregivers felt the confirmation page needed more scannable explanation or were confused, and all Veterans who arrived at the confirmation page said it was clear and understandable to them.

* 7 of 13 Caregivers some level of confusion on the confirmation page. Some Caregivers thought it wasn’t clearly explained why they would be assigned a different location for caregiver support and most participants didn’t understand the page until reading through every word.
* 5 of 5 Veterans who got to confirmation page thought it was clear/understandable.
* 3 of 8 Veterans selected the parent facility and did not see the confirmation page.

**Supporting behaviors:**

* P12: When they got to the facility confirmation screen which showed a different facility for caregiver support since they selected a clinic, they thought they should go back and change the facility to the caregiver support one listed so they did.

* P33: Participant didn’t notice the assigned caregiver support facility at first. He thought it was just a confirmation page. Then when he did read through the page he was very confused if he should go back and change the facility. Ultimately he decided to just continue and see what happened next.

**Supporting quotes:**

**Cohort 1 (Caregivers)**

> _P18: "Now this makes sense, [but] beginning of the caregiver journey I'd have no idea what this means. Knowing what I know, very confusing, [I'd rate it a] 1 [out of 5]."_ <br>

> _P6: "I'm confused now because it populated two different locations."_ <br>

> _P7: "Well I don't really know what to think of that [the assigned caregiver support facility]. I don't believe that's anything I have control over, right? That's an automated, prefilled thing. I just get sent to whoever they decide is gonna be my facility support. I don't really have a choice about that, do I?"_ <br>

> _P14: "You could explain why this is different than the one they selected. An average user would probably say, why are they different? That was my first thought, oh they're different, and then I had to read that paragraph."_ <br>

**Cohort 2 (Veterans)**

> _P32: "The caregiver facility (Lebanon) on the confirmation page is the one I was trying to find anyway." He understands that this location is where they will be supporting the caregivers._ <br>

> _P21: "Yeah, that's good to double check that it's the right clinic." Moves on._ <br>


## Secondary Findings

**Secondary Finding 1: Autofill caused issues on some browsers and devices - noted on Apple/Safari.**

Labels: DSC: Address block, DSC: Form controls; DSP: Error messages, DSP: Form feedback

Issues were observed on some browsers/devices with the autofill browser functionality not working as expected. In most situations the form field would show an error as if the field was left blank (along with yellow/blue shading in the form field) and was confusing to users. In one instance, no error was shown and using the browser refresh button, the user reset the form and was sent back to the form introduction page. Users had to type manually or add spaces as a work-around to get the empty state error message to go away. 

* 4 of 8 Veterans tried to use their browser default autofill functionality and had issues.
* 1 of 13 Caregivers had issues with the autofill and did not see an error (refreshed page to try and correct and ended up starting the form over from the introduction page).
* 5 of 13 Caregivers successfully used autofill.

**Supporting behaviors:**

* P22: Autofill caused errors to pop up. She had to add a space after each name.
* P27: Struggled with autofill on the address page and the form would not accept autofilled data. [Safari, desktop - Sequoia OS]
* P31: No issues with autofill on pulling in family information, like sisters. [Chrome, Mobile, Android]

**Supporting quotes:**

> _P12: Uses browser pre-fill for Veteran's home address - says they "always check to make sure the information pre-fills correctly" (in this case, the state entered incorrectly)_ <br>

> _P32: Used autofill for first name and it throws an error when he tries to continue. Doesn't know why this happened. Using an iPhone and Safari; "I think software is up to date."_ <br>

**Supporting video:**


**Secondary Finding 2: The county field was mostly answered correctly by both Veterans and Caregivers.**

Labels: DSC: Address block, DSP: Ask users for addresses

The _county_ field was mostly answered easily and correctly by users. However, some took pause or initially read as country until they read the error message. 

* 11 of 13 Caregivers entered a county correctly.
* 2 of 13 Caregivers entered USA initially (one with "United state" variation got through, one corrected after error).
* 7 of 8 Veterans entered county name correctly/easily.
* 1 of 8 Veterans initially entered USA and received a validation error.

**Supporting behaviors:**

* P22: Entered in county but finds additional info component confusing/distracting.
* P7: Paused at county but didn't say why, entered county correctly.


**Supporting quote:**

> _P5: Opened additional info about county and said "Oh okay this is for me - to connect me with resources to take better care of my spouse."_ <br>

**Secondary Finding 3: Not conclusive but users seemed to be fairly clear on whose information they were entering in the form.**

Labels: AUD: Caregivers, AUD: Family member, AUD: Veteran, DSC: Labels, DSP: Ask users for names, TREND: Content

The 10-10CG form requires information from multiple people - the Veteran, the Primary Caregiver and up to two Secondary Caregivers - and it was **not conclusive** if the slight confusion observed was due to form usability or due to the option that participants could use fake information during the study. 


* 6 of 8 Veterans had no issues with information placement.
* 1 of 8 Veterans had confusion with SSN placement (put SSN in first name field).
* 5 of 13 Caregivers mixed up who's information was being asked for/entered at some point in the form - between Veteran to Caregiver. 

**Supporting behavior:**

* P26: Put his SSN in "Veteran's first name" field (got confused by hint text). Then when he got to SSN he said "SSN, I just did that" (entered in first name field previously).


**Supporting quotes:**

> _P12: "When they did CHAMPVA, you didn't know who the form was talking about (the spouse or the Veteran). This is much easier. Much more self explanatory."_ <br>

> _P2: "I would repeat myself asking for my information again?" [Enters own info in Veteran step and comment is on Primary Caregiver add step (he reported being a Secondary)]_ <br>


**Supporting visual:**

**Secondary Finding 4: Automation/pre-fill was requested by some users unprompted.**

Labels: DSC: Text input, DSP: Help users know when there info is prefilled

There were a few instances where users suggested unprompted that the information could be prefilled based off of what was previously entered or known about the Veteran. Caregivers mentioned there is usually a preferred facility for the Veteran already or they make their decision based on what is closest to their address. 

* 1 of 8 Veterans mentioned the county should be prefilled based on address just entered.
* 1 of 8 Veterans mentioned you should be able to pre fill the Veteran's information based of their Benefit ID.
* 4 of 13 Caregivers mentioned they would select a facility based on location/proximity to them.
* 4 of 13 Caregivers stated Veterans already have a preferred facility.

**Supporting behavior:**

* P14: She was annoyed that she had to go off page to find the zip code for the VA facility they always use.


**Supporting quotes:**

> _P14: "So you're making me do the work when I just gave you a bunch of privacy info about us." (asking for county and facility after they entered in SSN and address) "It'd be nice if it corresponded to the address that you already entered in the previous step."_ <br>

> _P24: Mentioned the Veteran Benefit ID number (8 numbers), expects it to be on this form. "It is not, it should be. If you have this number, all of this stuff would be pre-loaded."_ <br>


**Secondary Finding 5: VA forms listed under the Sign as Representative step caused some confusion with participants.**

Labels: AUD: Caregivers; AUD: Family members; AUD: VSOs

Caregivers expressed some confusion around the documents or process required to sign as representative - and some of those who had a POA stated it might be easier to select the Veteran sign for themselves as they were with them most of the time anyways. Most Veterans stated they would sign for themselves, but two mentioned going through a VSO or that their spouse would need to upload their document when applying.

**Cohort 1 (Caregivers**
* 7 of 13 Caregivers mentioned some sort of confusion about the Sign as Representative documents needed
* 7 of 13 Caregivers mentioned the VA forms listed as Sign as Representative documents to upload as a confusion point - they were not sure if they had which VA form or not
* 6 of 13 Caregivers indicated they have one or more of the documents listed
* 2 of 13 Caregivers said they would download a VA form and upload at that point in the CG form
* 2 of 13 Caregivers stated they thought POA was needed to apply for the program

**Cohort 2 (Veterans)**
* 6 of 8 Veterans would sign for themselves (not POA)
* 2 of 8 Veterans would go VSO route, or spouse as POA, and they would sign/upload documents
* 1 of 8 Veterans was confused if a POA was required or not to even apply

**Supporting behavior:**

* P34: Would've looked up the VA forms online and filled them out and signed them and then uploaded that


**Supporting quotes:**

> _P33: "I would have to scan all this stuff first." The Alternative Signer Cert seems to be the simplest one to him to sign and upload. [would download, complete, sign and upload a VA form]_<br>

> _P18: As far as documentation...I do have now, I have the power of attorney and I have everything here.You guys aren’t gonna like this but a VSO advised me to sign as the Veteran on the initial application."_<br>

> _P7: I am not the LEGAL representative, I am his VA rep, what does that mean?_<br>

> _P31: "if I had any other forms on the list, I would upload those as well. I like redundancy."_<br>

> _P34: "I'm trying to think what I would've used. I'm in the system as being able to act on his behalf but the legal document I have is power of medical."_<br>

## Recommendations

**Recommendation 1: Revisit content and resource link placement within the form around program definition, eligibility and application process.**
_Related to: Key Finding 1 + Key Finding 3_

The biggest concern users had in usability testing was around eligibility and general program information, but users said the amount of content in the form was just enough. Therefore, we recommend adding links to further information within the form so users who are confused about topics such as eligibility, stipends, caregiver qualifications, and more can get information specific to their concerns where it is most relevant. Some of this detailed information lives outside of VA.gov on external VA sites.

As a result, we plan to:
* Revisit content updates for the following pages to address eligibility, stipend and caregiver qualifications:
    * CG form introduction page
    * Confirmation page
* Create a content inventory of found existing content/links we would recommend be used on the CG form pages (example: a bullet of content around stipends with a link out to the fact sheet).
    * Work with CAIA partners to collaboration on getting more of this information onto VA.gov
* Discuss with stakeholders:
    * How can we better set expectation for applicants about the program process?
    * How much information should be provided to help clarify the process without adding more confusion?
* Include content about roles and who needs to be involved should be on the introduction page before users start the form.
    * What are VA’s expectations when it comes to filling out and signing the form? Is it okay for people to sign for others or should everyone involved be present?
    * Call this out in the gather information step: gather people/signers 
* Break up the Sign as Representative content so it is scannable and addresses that it’s not a requirement - the Veteran can sign for themselves.

**Recommendation 2: Explore updating content to add in clarifying information around secondary caregivers and their benefits.**
_Related to: Key Finding 1 + Key Finding 2_

Our findings showed general confusion around secondary caregiver definitions and benefits. We would like to explore content updates and explanatory links to provide for users who aren’t familiar with the concept of secondary VA caregivers.

As a result, we plan to:
* Revisit caregiver clarification epic (in backlog).
* Revisit content and work with CAIA to help clarify on the _Add a Primary and Add a Secondary Caregiver_ questions.
* Provide additional explanation of the difference between primary and secondary caregivers, placement before and/or within form.

**Recommendation 3: Make updates to facility search functionality and content to help alleviate search errors observed.**
_Related to: Key Finding 4_

Both Caregivers and Veterans struggled with the facility search functionality so we will be making improvements to this step of the form before launching the new facility search updates.

As a result, we plan to:
* Address process in the content/label of needing to search as step 1 before they are able to choose from a list.
* Update the search button on mobile to include word "search," not just a magnifying glass icon as it currently is.

**Recommendation 4: Explore auto-recommend options for facility selection flow.**
_Related to: Key Finding 4 + Secondary Finding 4_

Since users struggled with the usability of the facility search step and some users commented that we should be able to suggest some nearby facilities, we’d like to explore making facility recommendations for the user based on (most likely) the Veteran’s home address. We’ll still need to give the user an easy way to start a new search in case the Veteran receives care somewhere not near their home address.

**Recommendation 5a: Make updates to the statement of truth component of the form to alleviate usability issues with signing the form.**
_Related to: Key Finding 2_

Many users struggled to sign the form in the review step because the text input needs to perfectly match the names entered in previous steps of the form. This caused a lot of frustration and confusion for users while not serving the purpose of making sure the form was securely completed and signed. 

Therefore, we plan to:

* Update the existing statement of truth component:
    * Remove custom statement of truth components and replace with Platform version
    * Utilize auto-fill functionality for all signers except Statement of Representative

**Recommendation 5b: Discuss questions with stakeholders regarding multiple people signing the form.**
_Related to: Key Finding 2_

Some participants seemed surprised when they got to the review page and realized others should be present to sign. We’d like to explore a better experience to the form flow for multiple people needing to sign online or have their information included.

Therefore, we plan to:

* Explore moving who is present/signing question or sign as representative question up in the form flow so we can require only that person to sign the form.

* Stay aware of and in support of future component improvements
   * An [experimental ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-design-system-documentation/issues/3253) has been opened by another team for signing forms by multiple people at different times. We will be watching if this can have future impact on the 10-10CG form.

**Recommendation 6: Research and identify why we saw users have problems with autofill in the form. Implement workarounds as directed by the design system team.**
_Related to: Secondary Finding 1_

We saw three users try to use autofill in the form and the form didn’t detect that they had entered anything in the fields. We have asked around to other product teams and found that this issue is likely specifically with Safari browsers and VADS has suggested a workaround that we should implement.

* Platform guidance on [Storybook](https://design.va.gov/storybook/?path=/docs/uswds-va-text-input--docs#autocomplete) for workaround:

> Note: on Safari (Mac or iOS), when using "Shift + Command + A" to autofill a field, no input event is fired, which means that any handler passed to onInput will not fire. This can result in errors on form submission, because from the component's perspective the autofilled field is empty. A suggested workaround is to synchronize field state with component state on submit by passing handlers to VaTextInput.

* [File a request with the VADS design system team](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-design-system-documentation/issues/new/choose)

**Recommendation 7: Revisit the “County” field content and explore possible autofill functionality.**
_Related to: Secondary Finding 2_

Most users successfully completed the “county” field but many paused since this is not standard in asking for addresses, and a couple entered a country instead of a county.

* Low priority: look into early 2025 since the recent content updates and validation has alleviated most of the errors. 
* Add "United state" to validation list in the interim and determine if others should be added as well.
* Longer term: Explore what can be prefilled based off of a list or previous home address entered.
* Don't recommend adding country to the top of the address block at this time.

**Recommendation 8: Make content updates to the Sign as Representative step/page to clarify that no form is required and explain why a Caregiver should upload one of the forms if they already have it on-hand.**
_Related to: Secondary Finding 5_

There was confusion and concern around signing as a representative for many of our Caregiver participants. Some Caregivers weren’t sure what some of the VA forms in the list were and several were concerned that there would be a problem if they couldn’t upload any of those documents.
Therefore, we plan to:

* Clarify with stakeholders: 
    * What should Caregivers do if they don't have any of those documents listed?
    * What is the best thing for a Caregiver to do if they have multiple documents in the list? What would be most helpful for the business?
    * Who should be uploading VA forms at this step and what should there instructions be?
* Make changes to content:
    * Knowing a Caregiver may not have any of the documents listed but would rather not lie and say they’re the Veteran, have stakeholders help us decide what to tell users to do in this situation.
    * Tell a user what to do if they have multiple documents in the list.
* Long term: Explore placement of this question within the form flow. 
    * Asking who is completing the form could be earlier in the form flow without discouraging or preventing people from applying. 
    * Look at how other teams address this scenario at the beginning of a form, like the IVC team.


## Next Steps

* Implement workaround for Safari autofill issue.
* Make updates to facility search before implementing changes in production.
* Meet with stakeholders to ask follow-up questions called out in recommendations and show our proposed solutions.
* Update statement of truth component to use platform library version and not custom version that is there currently. 
* Make content suggestions based on what we discuss and learn from our stakeholders and work with CAIA to finalize new content.
* Define longer term changes and prioritize in backlog, such as new statement of truth patterns and user flow changes.

## Who we talked to 

**Recruitment criteria**

Cohort 1 criteria:

* Must identify role as "caregiver"
* We aimed to recruit newer caregivers (enrolled in the past year or so) so we had Perigean gather dates of caregiver enrollment and choose the newest caregivers they got responses from.
* 7 participants who specified that they are enrolled as a caregiver in the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (PCAFC). The rest of the participants were a mix of yes or no to that screener question.
* We'd asked to have some pairs of caregiver + Veteran in the study, but it wasn't a requirement to qualify for the study.

Cohort 2 criteria:

* Must identify role as "Veteran"
* Must have a disability rating of 70% or higher AND must require some assistance from others to complete daily activities
* Recruit four assistive tech users - at least two completed AT sessions are needed for this study to be complete
