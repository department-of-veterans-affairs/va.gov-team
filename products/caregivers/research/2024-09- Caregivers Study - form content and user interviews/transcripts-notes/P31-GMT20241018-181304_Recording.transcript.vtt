33
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.899

37
00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:02.970

38
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:31.750
P31: was kind of the daytime caregiver when my aunt had to work, when, while when my grandmother was in the last stages of kidney failure and dementia. Luckily the dementia was early, but the the kidney failure was late, so in the final months of my grandmother's life. I helped take care of her you know, just getting her to and from the bathroom, keeping her company, making sure she didn't wander. And

39
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:43.240
P31: I would say, basically, you know, assisting them with with meals. Daily living tasks, you know, getting dressed.

00:03:44.573 --> 00:03:48.566
P31: You know. Social engagement, that sort of thing, running errands, shopping.

41
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:58.413
P31: Nothing, nothing ideally, nothing with with that would be be medical but

42
00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.019
P31: like medication reminders. That sort of thing.

P31: Knowing that I need to get my power of attorney and and

115

121
00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:21.659
P31: Oh, like, I need to share which? Okay, that. So this is work a little confusing to me. You'll also need to share share the Va. Medical Center, where the veteran receives care. So I would.

122
00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:41.940
P31: I was thinking that like, I need to go fill out a form. And and of course this is me because I I just over complicate things. I was gonna need just go like contact my my Va and and share share it. But it makes sense that I just need to know the name of the but it was it. I feel like it. It. That was a little confusing.

123
00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.390
Moderator: Okay. Good. To know.

124
00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:47.269

125
00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:52.370
P31: or share the location. Yeah, something like that might be more.

126
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:54.060
Moderator: Yeah, it's helpful. Thank you.

127
00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:12.399
P31: This is, that's that's the thing I needed. I'm gonna just open that in a new tab

Moderator: So we won't use this for this session, but I just want you to have it as the staging. It's not gonna actually let you submit an application on there.

141
00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:28.889
P31: No, that's still. Is this a staging? No, that's not staging. Where's the staging one to go?

142
00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:30.899
P31: Where did my staging window.

143
00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:39.279
Moderator: I have to open it again. I don't see it.

144
00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.700
P31: Yeah, yeah.

145
00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:42.690
P31: there we go.

146
00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:45.829
P31: So can I just start my application.

147
00:12:47.342 --> 00:12:49.809
Moderator: Yeah. Just one more question about this.

148
00:12:50.329 --> 00:12:50.849
P31: Sorry.

149
00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:56.010
Moderator: On a scale of one to 5, 1 being the worst and 5 being the best.

150
00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:05.070
Moderator: how prepared and informed do you feel about the application you're about to begin, based on that page's content.

151
00:13:06.458 --> 00:13:15.169
P31: Well, for I would say if if I was actually submitting a form like 1 1 to 5.

152
00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:21.299
P31: 1 1 being not at all ready, and 5 being completely ready.

153
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:21.950
Moderator: Yeah.

154
00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:26.088
P31: Okay, I'd say like 3,

155
00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:39.360
P31: but but if I can make it up definitely 5, it's just because I I it's a you know the I wouldn't have the power of attorney stuff, so I wouldn't be able to fill it out.

156
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:42.000
Moderator: Okay. So the only reason you're

157
00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:48.170
Moderator: you don't think you have the right document, and you think you need a power of attorney in particular.

158
00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:50.050
P31: Right? Right?

159
00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:53.990
P31: So I'd want to get that first.st But yeah, but I mean, for our purposes.

160
00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.899
P31: 100% ready.

161
00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:57.030

00:13:57.450 --> 00:13:58.790
Moderator: Thank you. That's helpful.

163
00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:02.460
Moderator: Alright. So now you can start the application as though you're applying

164
00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:18.149
Moderator: and just a reminder. This is a testing site. So you don't have to worry about any of the information that you were entering. Going anywhere. You can use real or fake information. Whatever is easier for you. I'll give you a fake social security number to put in when we get there.

165
00:14:18.718 --> 00:14:23.889
Moderator: Just continue thinking aloud as you go through the form. I want to hear about any reactions that you're having.

166
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:36.359
P31: So I'm going to fill this out as if it's my dad.

167

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:31.560
Moderator: Why are you pausing on this one.

181
00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:37.990
P31: Oh, okay, I'm trying to remember what county they're in. It's Louisville, Texas, den County.

182
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:43.180
P31: just blanked for a second. You know, it's 1 of those moments where you just forget your 1st name.

183
00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:49.090
Moderator: No, I I don't really keep the name of my county, you know, in the front of my mind, either.

184
00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:53.589
P31: Well, yeah, and this would be the I'm in a different county than my parents are. So.

Moderator: Would you have difficulty getting your dad's email address.

191
00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:29.770
P31: But

194
00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:43.119
P31: So I have that in here.

195
00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:43.980
Moderator: Okay.

196
00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.609

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:48.850
Moderator: Okay.

P31: That's fine!

200
00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:54.609
Moderator: For the purpose of the form. I just wanted to know how you would find that information.

201
00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.210
P31: Actually no, that is the one I have for him.

202
00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:05.970
P31: dismiss. Sorry now my alarm goes off for you.

203
00:17:08.369 --> 00:17:11.079
Moderator: Oh, I probably had. It set 1 h difference!

204
00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:11.939
P31: And

205
00:17:13.989 --> 00:17:16.199
P31: 6, 2 0 1.

206
00:17:19.649 --> 00:17:21.659
P31: That would be the Denver clinic.

207
00:17:25.979 --> 00:17:27.299
P31: Did they move.

208
00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:30.810
Moderator: Does that not look right to you.

209
00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:37.399
P31: No. The Denver clinic was 2, 2, 2, 2, 3 Colorado Boulevard.

210
00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:41.009
P31: Now it's 2, 3, 2, 2. San Jacinto.

211
00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:42.350
Moderator: Okay, so.

212
00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:43.630
P31: I'm wondering if they moved.

213
00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:49.500
P31: What would you.

214
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:50.370
Moderator: Verify that.

215
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:51.440
P31: I'm actually gonna

216
00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:58.110
P31: yeah, I I would actually, in this case, I would. I would just do the Dallas Va Medical Center.

217
00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:01.280
P31: But because that's the that's the that's the

218
00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:03.660
P31: hub, you know.

219
00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:12.660
P31: Because that it didn't just has an outpatient clinic. So Dallas would actually be his Va. His Va. Facility.

220
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.550
Moderator: Okay. Gotcha.

221
00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:15.870
Moderator: Oh.

222
00:18:16.255 --> 00:18:16.640
P31: Which.

223
00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:17.070
Moderator: How would?

224
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:18.210
P31: For benefits.

225
00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:19.679
P31: Oh, sorry! Go ahead!

226
00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:30.650
Moderator: Just gonna pause you there for a second. How would you rate that process of selecting a facility, one to 5, 1 being the worst and 5 being the best. How how is that process?

227
00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:35.390
P31: Oh, 4!

228
00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:38.140
P31: Oh, wait! Wait! 5 being the best.

229
00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:39.050
Moderator: Yeah.

230
00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.390
P31: Yeah, 4. 4. Now.

231
00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.870
Moderator: Okay. Why would you rate it? That.

232
00:18:47.085 --> 00:18:50.967
P31: Because it was, it had all, all the different facilities listed.

233
00:18:51.350 --> 00:19:03.089
P31: Well, actually, I'm gonna drop it down to 3, because it the the question like the the specification. Well, this is, I guess it would be where my primary clinic is. So yeah.

234
00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:05.910
Moderator: But where you came from.

235
00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:18.520
P31: Mostly it's mostly the making it up. For my dad. Part, I'm kind of doing this half with me in mind, you know, of where I go, and because he doesn't actually go to the Va.

236
00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:19.560
Moderator: Okay.

237
00:19:24.146 --> 00:19:26.450
P31: Would I like to?

238
00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:31.489
P31: There can only be one. No.

239
00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:34.280
P31: let's say yes.

240
00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:37.409
Moderator: What does the term primary caregiver mean to you?

241
00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:46.663
P31: I would like in in my case, I'm I'm gonna I'm saying, yes, because I'm gonna pretend I'm I'm actually my mom. But

242
00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:51.910
P31: it it would be whoever's living with him

243
00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:54.590
P31: in the same house.

244
00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:57.070
P31: and with him the most.

245
00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:06.830
Moderator: Okay, Gotcha, let's go through a scenario where we are. The primary caregiver on the application can be you or your mom. Whatever's easier.

246
00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:08.120
P31: Okay.

247
00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:08.840
Moderator: Just keep thinking.

248
00:20:09.501 --> 00:20:12.148
P31: Got both of us.

249
00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:16.500
P31: She doesn't have a suffix.

250
00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.290
P31: September 17, th

251
00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:24.679
P31: 1955. Female!

252
00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.580
P31: How's that great.

253
00:20:42.934 --> 00:20:44.310
Moderator: I think so. Yep.

254
00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:47.819
Moderator: Just needs to be a certain amount of digits.

255
00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:48.730
P31: Yeah,

256
00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:49.920
P31: one.

257
00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:52.610
P31: Same addresses for that home.

258
00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:56.700
P31: 1, 68, county denton yep

259
00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:01.399
P31: is it the same yep, that would be correct

260
00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:04.879
P31: primary character with phone number.

261
00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:27.770
P31: Yes. Oh, yeah, definitely want to do that, because that'd be the secondary.

262
00:21:35.235 --> 00:21:36.360
P31: 3.rd

263
00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:39.409
P31: Hmm, hang on

264
00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:43.410
P31: counter.

265
00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:01.720
P31: No, no, no, no, this is not secondary purposes.

266
00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:06.890
P31: Terrence.

267
00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:39.270
P31: Secondary. Yes.

268
00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:44.210
P31: Stacey.

269
00:22:47.856 --> 00:22:48.790
P31: yeah, sure.

270
00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:59.930
Moderator: What does a secondary caregiver mean to you?

271
00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:07.930
P31: anyone who would be doing like respite for the primary.

272
00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:13.930
P31: or just checking in, you know, a couple of times a week.

273
00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:15.109
P31: you know.

274
00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:17.020
Moderator: Okay.

275
00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:23.660
Moderator: And how do you think that that secondary role differs in the application process and the benefits from the primary caregiver.

276
00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:38.850
P31: How it differs in the application process. So far it hasn't been different.

277
00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.880
Moderator: Do you think that the benefits would be different?

278
00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:44.890
P31: Oh, yeah, definitely, definitely, 100%.

279
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:58.769
P31: But I'm not sure which way it would go, because it would feel like the primary caregiver. But they do. They do weird things in the health and human services like your your family member can't be your primary caregiver

280
00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:04.799
P31: for some reason or and get paid for it, but I would think ideally the primary caregiver would

281
00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:09.940
P31: get more of the money, and a secondary caregiver would

282
00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:15.920
P31: just be there for, like respite, or something, you know less benefits.

283
00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:18.500
Moderator: Okay, thank you.

284
00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:20.710

300
00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:35.019

00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:08.920
P31: I wonder

339
00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:14.290
P31: maybe I don't have her social security number anymore.

340
00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:18.210
P31: Thought, I did.

P31: a representative.

353

P31: I'm going to pretend I'm a representative.

354
00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:19.360
Moderator: Okay.

355
00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:21.520
P31: Of what's the legal authority?

356
00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:32.389
P31: So uploading? Let's see if we don't have one of the documents here. Add power attorney.

357
00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:38.329
P31: legal documents, signer certificate, and pretend to have a fire power of attorney.

358
00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:41.959
P31: Do do, media picker.

Moderator: what kind of document. Would you upload.

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:13.360
Moderator: Do you? Do you or your mom have that.

367
00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:30.599
P31: I'm saying I'm in this world that I'm I'm pretending. Yes, I do. And that would be something. Yeah, it was if I was signing it as his as someone who had that I would. Yeah, I would. I would. I would always have a copy of that on my phone.

368
00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:33.040
Moderator: Yeah, okay.

369
00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:37.869
P31: Anyone any of their legal documents I would have on my I would have copies of.

370
00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:45.840
Moderator: Okay? What if you're filling it out for your dad and you do not have a power of attorney? What would you do.

371
00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:46.510
P31: I

372
00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:53.907
P31: I would contact my mother and ask her if she da does, and or

373
00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:56.660
P31: as you know.

374
00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.260
P31: ask her to.

375
00:30:58.420 --> 00:30:59.140
P31: It's

376
00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:00.360
P31: m

377
00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:04.380
P31: go about getting one if she needed to get one.

378
00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:12.510
P31: I'm actually pretty sure cause they they're kind of meticulous about these things. They have them. I'm sure they have them filed away somewhere.

379
00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:20.929
P31: I just don't know how how well they keep their records, but I know they've they've done all this paperwork. Dnr stuff, you know all the they have all that stuff

380
00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.557
P31: for each other.

381
00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:24.610
Moderator: Okay. Gotcha.

382
00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:39.419
P31: So. And and they're actually very tech. Savvy? Funny enough. My parents were on the Internet before the Internet existed. So yeah, they're huge computer nerds. So yeah, they're they're they're more technically savvy than I am when it comes to computers. At least.

383
00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:44.829
Moderator: And for them. So in your own words, what would you expect to happen next?

384
00:31:46.406 --> 00:31:48.229
P31: I would hit continue

385
00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:50.180
P31: good

386
00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:52.780
P31: because I'm up

387
00:31:53.513 --> 00:31:54.719
P31: in this

388
00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:59.160
P31: in this world. I've I've got the form, and I've uploaded it.

389
00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:08.729
P31: If I had any other forms that they needed, or that were on the list, I would upload those as well just to be safe, because I like redundancy.

390
00:32:09.389 --> 00:32:13.239
P31: But yeah, I mean, can continue.

391
00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:14.989
Moderator: Yep. Go ahead!

392

P31: that one didn't technically say full name.

414
00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:51.944
P31: It just says, Enter your name.

415
00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:54.099
Moderator: Helpful feedback. Thank you.

416

Moderator: What do you think about this.

421
00:35:43.856 --> 00:35:45.229
P31: I'm thinking.

422
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:48.070
P31: Patricia Sue, Lockhart.

423
00:35:50.830 --> 00:35:53.179
P31: Oh, maybe it's a space at the end.

424
00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:56.780
P31: Nope.

425
00:35:58.050 --> 00:35:59.470
P31: leave us out, of space.

426
00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.180
P31: hmm.

427
00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:26.570
P31: there is a space. I bet.

428
00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:28.530
P31: Yep.

429
00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:40.867

430
00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:42.540
Moderator: Okay.

431
00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:44.470
Moderator: that is.

432
00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:46.080
P31: That would maybe refresh my page.

433
00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:48.800

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:52.799
Moderator: It's going to erase everything. Oh, actually, it took you back to the beginning.

435
00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:55.679
Moderator: That's okay. We were about done, anyway.

438
00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:01.665
P31: Okay.

439
00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:07.279

442
00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:14.139
P31: Oh, there it is! Is that it? Yeah, there it goes.

443
00:37:14.673 --> 00:37:18.889
P31: It. It went away. It hid. It was hiding from me.

444
00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:20.520
Moderator: Yeah, I did.

445
00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:23.069
Moderator: It's definitely wonky on mobile.

446
00:37:23.905 --> 00:37:31.799
Moderator: So on that last page that you were trying to fill out. What were your thoughts about why it was giving you all those errors.

447
00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:40.570
Moderator: Can you hear me? Okay.

448
00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:42.780
P31: I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

449
00:37:43.727 --> 00:37:48.019
P31: Yeah, I'm thinking I would think it'd be thinking it's an error.

450
00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:51.659
Moderator: But you don't know why.

451
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.479
P31: I don't know why. No.

452
00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:55.480
Moderator: Okay, thanks. That's helpful.

453
00:37:56.970 --> 00:38:02.549
Moderator: And then what would your comfort level be with filling that out and signing for people who are not present.

454
00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:04.880
P31: I wouldn't.

455
00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:06.459
Moderator: Wouldn't do it.

456
00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:07.810
P31: No.

457
00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:10.719
Moderator: What would you do if you had to fill that out for real.

458
00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:19.069
P31: I would I would make sure all 3 of us were present and and did it together.

459
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.049
Moderator: Yeah, that's helpful.

460
00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:23.770
P31: Or or maybe a phone call.

461
00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:25.569
P31: At least I don't know.

462
00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:29.960
Moderator: okay.

463
00:38:30.576 --> 00:38:43.039
Moderator: I'm gonna share the final like confirmation page that would come up because we can't even get to that in the prototype, anyway, and we lost our spot, so I will share one. I just want to get your feedback on it.

464
00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:44.100
P31: Okay.

465
00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:49.100
Moderator: Can you see this? Okay? Do you need me to zoom in.

466
00:38:50.570 --> 00:38:55.302
P31: Oh, oh, you're sharing a screen. Gotcha. Sorry I thought you were putting it.

467
00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:59.109
P31: I don't know why I was thinking a link. Yeah, okay, yeah.

468
00:39:00.188 --> 00:39:04.359
Moderator: Actually, I found a mobile version of it that you'll be able to see better.

469
00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:05.839
Moderator: Let me switch to that.

470
00:39:08.210 --> 00:39:08.930
Moderator: Okay.

471
00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:11.390
Moderator: alright.

472
00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:14.910
Moderator: is this right? No, it's not sorry.

473
00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:18.490
Moderator: And.

474
00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:20.069
P31: This is fine.

475
00:39:20.350 --> 00:39:22.400
Moderator: Okay. Can you see it? All right? Can you read it?

476
00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:23.419
P31: Yeah, yeah,

477
00:39:24.590 --> 00:39:27.280
P31: I can zoom in and out as I need to.

478
00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:36.839
Moderator: Okay, so I just want you to describe to me in your own words what this page is telling you happened and what comes next in the process.

479
00:39:39.058 --> 00:39:42.169
P31: That I completed my application successfully.

480
00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:49.030
P31: I would print this page.

481
00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:51.129
P31: So I had a record.

482
00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:57.769
P31: and I would expect that someone is going to

483
00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:02.670
P31: contact me

484
00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:05.859
P31: to discuss this application eligibility.

485
00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:11.120
P31: If you give your email address. Oh, yeah, thank you.

486
00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:15.880
P31: gotcha.

487
00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:18.920
P31: They can contact.

488
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:36.850
P31: I would. I would definitely click that link right there. The learn more about family caregiver program decision reviews and appeals.

489
00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:38.799
Moderator: Okay, why is that.

490
00:40:43.403 --> 00:40:59.580
P31: Because I'm always wanting to learn more. I don't know. I like I like to figure knowing it. I like to know things in advance, like you know what the process is. I like to know how things work and what like timelines. And I like I I'd probably

491
00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:06.639
P31: I wanna add, add the contact information so that it wouldn't be in my, it wouldn't come to my spam folder.

492
00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:08.940
Moderator: Okay. Gotcha.

493
00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:16.299
P31: And then it would probably go right to that. That link to the the program of General caregiver support services.

494
00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:17.450
Moderator: Okay.

495
00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:20.200
Moderator: Yep.

496
00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:21.519
P31: Shit. Where'd I go?

497
00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:24.180
P31: Sorry. Who lost it? Okay, got it?

498
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.390
P31: And

499
00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:33.890
P31: your routine? Okay, yeah. Looks good.

500
00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:38.849
Moderator: Okay. Is there anything that you would want to see here that you don't.

501
00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:43.880
P31: No.

502
00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:48.060
P31: I mean, yeah, no, because I I

503
00:41:48.090 --> 00:41:50.730
P31: I'd I'd print the page. So

504
00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:52.270
P31: maybe

505
00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:54.522
P31: actually I would.

506
00:41:55.450 --> 00:42:04.979
P31: No, no, no, actually no cause I could. I could, just because I could print print the page and then save it as a Pdf on my phone. So yeah, that's exactly what I would have done.

507
00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:06.810
Moderator: Okay, gotcha

508
00:42:07.671 --> 00:42:20.249
Moderator: alright. Thank you so much for your feedback on that. Just have like a couple of final questions. So now that you've seen the form. What research would you do before applying and completing a form like this?

509
00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:26.660
P31: I would go and read through that an entire website about program.

510
00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:31.260
P31: care and all that stuff.

511
00:42:35.519 --> 00:42:37.670
Moderator: The links that you just saw on that page.

512
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:39.450
P31: yeah.

513
00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:56.750
P31: yeah, I would venture down, probably a 2 to 3, h, rabbit hole reading every that's just me, I'm, just weird like that. I like to know as much stuff as possible about the process and the options. And you know.

514
00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:58.900
P31: okay.

515
00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:09.809
P31: if I'm not going to qualify, I don't want to apply, you know. I I like to. I'd like to know that I'm going to apply because I don't waste a bunch of time applying. If I'm not going to get it.

516
00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:10.810
P31: Yeah.

517
00:43:11.110 --> 00:43:15.741
P31: And I don't wanna waste all time. Yeah, I I yeah, that's that's just me.

518
00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:29.550
Moderator: Gotcha would you want to have help with someone? Would you want to have help filling out this form from someone like an accredited representative, or a Vso or someone else from the Va.

519
00:43:29.550 --> 00:43:32.490
P31: That. Yeah, that's I always want to do that

520
00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:44.650
P31: always. Because, yeah, I mean, that was, yeah, since I applied. That's since I applied for my benefits originally. That's that's that's the main way I want to apply for anything, is it? With a so.

521
00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:47.410
Moderator: Okay, why do you like.

522
00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:53.220
P31: Just just because I I know when it comes to

523
00:43:53.738 --> 00:43:55.930
P31: the government, you know, it's

524
00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:01.299
P31: it's very easy to slip through the cracks. The Va has

525
00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:15.016
P31: really healed up a lot of that. Those issues from like when I applied, you know, 13 years ago. To to today it definitely streamlined it and and automated it a lot better. But

526
00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:24.949
P31: I just I feel better, knowing that someone who knows how to fill those forms out and does does it every day?

527
00:44:25.605 --> 00:44:26.655
P31: When would.

528
00:44:27.310 --> 00:44:28.640
P31: you know, be able to

529
00:44:28.770 --> 00:44:29.570
P31: help.

530
00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:31.729
Moderator: Okay, Gotcha.

531
00:44:31.810 --> 00:44:39.089
Moderator: what were your thoughts about the amount of information that was provided in the form? Did you think it was too much too little, or just enough.

532
00:44:41.826 --> 00:44:43.360
P31: Just enough.

533
00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:45.780
P31: possibly

534
00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:47.710
P31: on the

535
00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:49.939
P31: too much side.

536
00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:52.120
Moderator: Okay.

537
00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:57.029
P31: just as far as the like. The names and stuff.

538
00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:01.770
Moderator: Okay, like the information that it was asking of you.

539
00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:03.309
Moderator: Do you mean.

540
00:45:03.310 --> 00:45:05.149
P31: Oh, no, I mean like

541
00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:11.530
P31: like having some some such like the 1st middle and last name, you know.

542
00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:12.510
Moderator: Yeah.

543
00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:18.090
P31: They were so spaced out. There was a lot of words, for like like, I'm used to seeing the form words like.

544
00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:20.980
P31: you know, all of us on one line, you know.

545
00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:22.040
Moderator: I gotcha.

546
00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:26.700
P31: And or you have the box, and it'd be like, last 1st name. Yeah.

547
00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:28.670
Moderator: Yeah, okay, that's helpful.

548
00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:36.470
Moderator: Is there any information about who qualifies to be the primary and the secondary caregiver that you would like to see.

549
00:45:37.310 --> 00:45:45.600
P31: That would. Yeah, that would that 100%. That'd be part of my rabbit hole of the program information and

550
00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:55.089
P31: how it works. And and and and also professional. You know, the ability to bring on professional caregivers, you know, whenever possible

551
00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:57.160
P31: or whenever needed.

552
00:45:58.010 --> 00:45:58.440
P31: Okay.

553
00:45:58.670 --> 00:46:02.570

Moderator: We have the one that says, va.gov not staging.va.gov.

558
00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:26.279
Moderator: You see that.

559
00:46:28.290 --> 00:46:31.350
P31: Yeah, I'm just gonna copy and paste it because it keeps

560
00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:34.090
P31: taking one and out. Let's see.

568
00:46:57.450 --> 00:47:08.360
Moderator: Okay, great. I just want to circle back and reconfirm. Are you comfortable? If we wanted to use a video clip of our session to share with our Va. Partners removing any identifying information.

569
00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:12.159
P31: Definitely definitely. Yeah, I'm I'm perfectly comfortable with that.
