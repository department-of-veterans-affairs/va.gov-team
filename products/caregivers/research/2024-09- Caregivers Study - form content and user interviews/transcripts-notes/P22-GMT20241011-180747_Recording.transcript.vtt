00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:08.790
Moderator: Okay. So I have started the recording. And just to confirm, are you comfortable? If I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

2
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.090
P22: Yes, I am.

3
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:18.450
Moderator: Okay? And are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion to share with Va partners, and we'll remove any identifiable information.

4
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:19.500
P22: Yes.

5
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.660
Moderator: Okay.

6
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:27.200
Moderator: alright. So before we look at the caregiver program online form, let's start with a few warm-up questions today. So

7
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:35.410
Moderator: are you up enrolled? Or have you applied for the program of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers in the past?

8
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.989
P22: Yes.

9
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.820
Moderator: Did you apply? And are you enrolled or just applied, and not enrolled.

10
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.980
P22: Think I'm enrolled.

11
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:47.500
Moderator: Okay.

12
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.190
P22: Think.

13
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.280
Moderator: Okay.

14
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.960
Moderator: we'll go with that. Then. Do you know about how many months ago you may have been enrolled.

15
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.019
P22: It's it's been a little bit

16
00:01:01.365 --> 00:01:02.450
P22: maybe

17
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.750
P22: 5 months.

18
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.870
Moderator: Okay.

19
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.389
Moderator: Do you know, if you used a Vso or accredited representative to help you sign up for the caregiver program.

20
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.290
P22: No, we didn't use any any help.

21
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:15.570
Moderator: Okay.

22
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.459
Moderator: did you enroll with both a primary and a secondary caregiver?

23
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:21.760
P22: No.

24
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.629
Moderator: Just the primary.

25
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:24.570
P22: Yeah.

26
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.210
Moderator: Okay.

27
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.559
P22: I didn't even know you could enroll a secondary.

28
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.960
Moderator: Okay.

29
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:35.279
Moderator: did you complete the 1010 cg. Form in person, or at a facility or online.

30
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.490
P22: Oh, it was at the Va.

31
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.400
Moderator: Okay.

32
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.510
Moderator: Can you tell me a little bit more about your overall experience there, just whatever you can remember about the application process.

33
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.400
P22: Yeah, I remember it was a little I thought it was a little tedious.

34
00:01:55.203 --> 00:02:05.519
P22: And it was a little confusing, like we like. The reason we ended up doing it. At the Va. Is because we had a bunch of questions about the form and stuff.

35
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:06.340
Moderator: Got it.

36
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.860
Moderator: Yeah. Did you get? We're able to get your questions answered that route, or was there anything else about that experience?

37
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.280
P22: There were some we got answers to, and others it was just like.

38
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.040
P22: roll the dice. And hopefully, we're right.

39
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.810
Moderator: Got it.

40
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:31.059
Moderator: Is there anything else you'd like to share about your experience with applying for the caregiver program, good or bad, neutral, anything.

41
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.230
P22: No, it would. I? I guess my thing was, it was 1st off. We didn't know about it for so long.

42
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.879
P22: and then second off it. It wasn't easy.

43
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:51.099
P22: so it wasn't like it wasn't like like, the paperwork wasn't very understandable

44
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.349
P22: of what the questions they were asking and stuff.

45
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.010
Moderator: Got it.

46
00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.020
Moderator: Okay.

47
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.059
Moderator: is there anything else you want to add about what you remember

48
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.779
Moderator: before we kind of take a look at the online form as it is now.

49
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.360
P22: No, that's all I remember.

50
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.960
P22: Okay.

51
00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.299
Moderator: I'm going to put a link in chat for you that goes to our testing site.

52
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.060
P22: Okay.

53
00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.279
Moderator: I'd like you to click on it. And then, when you're ready.

54
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.109
Moderator: you have ready to screen, share, share, just the tab or screen for this site.

55
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.789
Moderator: Let me know if you need any help. I can walk you through that.

56
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:33.570
P22: Okay,

57
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.910
P22: yeah. How do I share.

58
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.950
Moderator: Okay, are you on a mobile or tablet.

59
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:40.730
P22: Yeah.

60
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.649
Moderator: There should be at the bottom a share screen or like broadcast screen.

61
00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.419
Moderator: Okay, hold on.

62
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.390
Moderator: And if you need to take a minute to close anything on your phone. Go ahead and do that, too.

63
00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.220
P22: Oh, share, content.

64
00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.980
Moderator: Yep.

65
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.130
P22: Share. Screen.

66
00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:03.000
P22: Yep.

67
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.709
Moderator: And it probably comes up with a message about broadcasting.

68
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.229
Moderator: and then click! Yes, and then you'll open up the window.

69
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.020
P22: Okay.

70
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.000
P22: Art.

71
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.200
P22: Okay. Can you see it? Yep.

72
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.190
Moderator: I can see it.

73
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.430
P22: Okay. Okay. Cool.

74
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.230
Moderator: Feel free to move my face out of the way, too, if you need to see anything.

75
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:46.549
Moderator: Okay. So I would just like you to review this page and tell me your initial thoughts and expectations about the program before going forward. And just remember to think aloud as much as possible. We really want to hear what you're kind of going through your head as you're going through this.

76
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.045
P22: Okay.

77
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.839
P22: I don't think I even saw this page when we were looking to do it.

78
00:05:00.398 --> 00:05:05.560
P22: Because it would have been nice to check early on if I was eligible.

79
00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.399
P22: We just went and filled the form out, not knowing if we were eligible or not.

80
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.219
P22: Okay, yeah. I mean, I can follow this.

81
00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:43.580
Moderator: Okay, does anything on the page stand out to you as being confusing or really helpful?

82
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.660
P22: It's helpful having that the support

83
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.830
P22: where you can call and ask questions for help filling out the form

84
00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.209
P22: cause. Then we wouldn't have had to have gone all the way to the Va.

85
00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:59.880
P22: That would have been helpful to know.

86
00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.570
P22: I wish that was like up top.

87
00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.740
Moderator: Is there anything else on this page here that you

88
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.920
Moderator: like to?

89
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:10.830
Moderator: You find extra.

90
00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:11.240
P22: Helpful.

91
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.690
Moderator: Or like to see, moved around.

92
00:06:16.241 --> 00:06:28.310
P22: I like that. The start. Your application is at the top and the bottom. But I think the big thing for me is having that. If you have questions I would I would put that like right up front.

93
00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.010
Moderator: Thanks for that feedback that's helpful.

94
00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:43.569
Moderator: and on a scale of one to 5 of one being very poor and 5 being very well. How prepared and informed do you feel about the application you're about to begin? Based on this page's content.

95
00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:48.220
P22: Okay, what's 1? Again?

96
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.300
Moderator: Very poorly, and 5 is very good.

97
00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.500
P22: I I would say, maybe like

98
00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:56.860
P22: a 3,

99
00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:02.260
P22: because I I still wouldn't know what to expect.

100
00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.260
P22: I'd have to like click on the links and stuff, I guess.

101
00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:15.229
P22: But I I would still be like, Okay, what is this form? I'm getting ready to fill out.

102
00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:25.029
Moderator: Yeah, is there anything else you would do from this point before starting the application.

103
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:30.419
P22: Yeah, I would click on that. Check your eligibility thing first.st

104
00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:34.700
Moderator: You can feel free to do that, if that's what you would normally do.

105
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:35.600
P22: Okay

106
00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.030
P22: requirements.

107
00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:00.750
P22: Okay.

108
00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:09.769
Moderator: Yeah, I'm curious. Does that help answer the questions you were looking for on the previous page?

109
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:12.460
P22: Yeah, it does. It does.

110
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:15.680
Moderator: Is there anything else she's

111
00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:19.229
Moderator: still want information on here that you think is missing?

112
00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:24.240
P22: Hold on. I'm still

113
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:46.529
P22: no, but I did. One part that we missed throughout the whole process was that you can have the secondary family caregivers.

114
00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:52.689
P22: so I don't know if that needs to be even bigger print, maybe highlighted in blue or something.

115
00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:53.835
P22: But

116
00:08:54.740 --> 00:09:00.800
P22: We missed that throughout the whole process. I mean, I was shocked when you said you can have more than one.

117
00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:16.669
Moderator: If there's anything else on this page you wanna look at before you would start the application.

118
00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:19.000
P22: Oh, yeah, I'm still still reading.

119
00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:42.030
P22: Now, this is

120
00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:48.425
P22: this is very good information. I needed to know when I 1st tried.

121
00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:12.249
P22: yeah, this is, this is very good information.

122
00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:16.779
P22: I I definitely wish I had known this. To begin with.

123
00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:21.799
Moderator: Got it so that feedback.

124
00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:26.180
Moderator: Now can you just go ahead and start the application as if you were applying.

125
00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:27.800
P22: Yes.

126
00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:37.390
P22: this one. Okay.

127
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:39.740
P22: Okay.

128
00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:50.899
Moderator: So, yeah, this is our testing site. So you don't have to worry about your information going anywhere but feel free to either use real or fake information, whatever you feel most comfortable with.

129
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:52.790
P22: Okay?

130
00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:03.380
P22: Oh, I don't have any of that.

131
00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:18.430
P22: Okay.

132
00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:25.470
P22: Oh.

133
00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:27.970
P22: I thought I had typed that in.

134
00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:39.250
P22: is it not taking the information.

135
00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:47.000
Moderator: Yeah, it seems to be doing something a little odd. There, try just putting your cursor in that field in space and see if it clears it.

136
00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:49.470
Moderator: That work.

137
00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:55.960
Moderator: Oh, that's weird!

138
00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:56.810
P22: Yeah.

139
00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:58.340
P22: okay.

140
00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:02.349
Moderator: I can give you a fake number here if you're not comfortable with doing that. So 3, 2, 1,

141
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.299
Moderator: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

142
00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:14.000
P22: Okay.

143
00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:33.710
P22: Oops!

144
00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:35.330
P22: Oops!

145
00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:45.530
P22: Carol.

146
00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:51.760
Moderator: What are your thoughts and impressions as you're entering in that one.

147
00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:58.969
P22: Oh, I would it! It threw me off where it said, the why we asked this information, and the arrow pointing down.

148
00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:04.079
P22: I had to look again to see what it was really asking for. The county.

149
00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:07.870
Moderator: Got it so that feedback.

150
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:13.980
P22: Yeah. Having the why we asked this information right there, pointing to the box, is confusing

151
00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:18.810
P22: cause I thought you wanted me to answer why

152
00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:21.890
P22: you were asking for that information.

153
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.909
Moderator: Got it. Thank you for that feedback. That's helpful.

154
00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:41.959
Moderator: Yeah. And just remember to talk aloud on this page. Just want to hear any reactions you're having.

155
00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:46.890
P22: Yeah, okay, yeah. I was just reading what they were asking for.

156
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:53.310
P22: Okay.

157
00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:58.519
P22: what if you don't have an alternate phone number? Can I just leave that blank.

158
00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:01.890
Moderator: Yeah. Is that your expectations there on that field.

159
00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:03.270
P22: Yeah.

160
00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:11.579
P22: Yeah. Cause I I don't.

161
00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:13.819
P22: I'm just gonna assume I can leave it blank.

162
00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:16.440
Moderator: Okay.

163
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:19.319
P22: Should say, like optional or something.

164
00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.670
P22: Okay.

165
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:36.080
P22: okay? So I would have to look this up immediately.

166
00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:39.950
P22: like I would not know my postal code to my Va.

167
00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:45.540
Moderator: Know? How would you prefer to search for a Va. Facility.

168
00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:48.999
P22: I would just Google it.

169
00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.359
P22: I guess I mean, that's what I have to do, because

170
00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:58.379
P22: otherwise I wouldn't know how to find that

171
00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:00.020
P22: I?

172
00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.359
P22: Oh, well, that's helpful.

173
00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:10.820
P22: It pull. I I, okay, yeah.

174
00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:13.590
Moderator: Yeah, what are you thinking with what happened? There?

175
00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:15.940
P22: Okay, yeah, I would have.

176
00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.469
P22: I just push that by chance.

177
00:15:19.082 --> 00:15:22.710
P22: Because I would still be looking at my postal code.

178
00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:31.029
P22: But that's helpful that you don't have to go look that up. But I would have wasted time. Go and look that up.

179
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:33.780
Moderator: Got it. Thanks for explaining that.

180
00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:42.989
Moderator: Yes, and if you wanted to change the facility you selected by doing a new search, can you walk me through. How you would do that.

181
00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:45.210
P22: Back.

182
00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:52.329
P22: I would type back in Dallas.

183
00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:57.630
P22: Texas. Oh, now I see. Or postal code, that is tiny.

184
00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:02.210
P22: I would I missed the or thing.

185
00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:11.279
P22: Yeah, I'd have wasted time and went off. And Google searched my postal code for Dallas, Va.

186
00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:13.769
Moderator: Okay, thanks for explaining that.

187
00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:16.940
P22: So.

188
00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:21.509
P22: So yeah, I would just go back and then click whichever one.

189
00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:28.699
P22: I guess I would get confused, though

190
00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:34.279
P22: the difference between the Dallas, Va. Medical Center.

191
00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:38.950
P22: the North Texas Va. Mobile clinic.

192
00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:42.000
P22: and the Dallas Va. Clinic

193
00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:44.900
P22: like. Now that I've read them all.

194
00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:49.899
P22: I wouldn't know. They all seem to be at the same address, so I wouldn't know which one I'm

195
00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:51.690
P22: I get my care at.

196
00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:55.639
Moderator: Got it. Thanks for that feedback. What would

197
00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:59.059
Moderator: you want to have on this page to help you figure that out.

198
00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:06.529
P22: I'd have been fine with it, just just saying the Dallas one.

199
00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:09.760
P22: Okay, and

200
00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:15.900
P22: because the the 2 underneath the Dallas, one the North Clinic, Mobile Clinic.

201
00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:18.289
P22: and the Dallas Va. Clinic.

202
00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:21.209
P22: I don't know which one

203
00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.729
P22: like now that I've read them in detail.

204
00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.630
P22: I wouldn't know which one to pick.

205
00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:32.090
P22: cause they're

206
00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:39.389
P22: they're all on Lancaster Road, and that's the only thing I know about the Va. Is that it's on Lancaster

207
00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:40.730
P22: Road.

208
00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:46.199
P22: but at this point in time. I would have to like call the Va.

209
00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.710
P22: Because I wouldn't know which one

210
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.289
P22: which is the one I see care at.

211
00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:55.770
Moderator: About it.

212
00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.509
Moderator: Yeah, thanks for that feedback that's really helpful

213
00:17:58.630 --> 00:17:59.759
Moderator: to hear again.

214
00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.839
Moderator: Yeah, so just pick the one.

215
00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:06.950
P22: Yeah, by default, I just picked the 1st one, but that would be a total guess on my part.

216
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:12.199
P22: cause it's probably one of the top 3,

217
00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:15.990
P22: but which one of the top 3. I have no clue.

218
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:18.200
Moderator: About it.

219
00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:29.359
Moderator: I'll pause you here for a second, but do another kind of rating question on a scale of one to 5 again, one being very poorly and 5 being very well.

220
00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:33.519
Moderator: how would you rate the process there to select a Va. Facility.

221
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:37.530
P22: That one was pretty poor because I mean I totally guessed on that one.

222
00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:38.120
Moderator: Okay.

223
00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:41.729
P22: I mean, that was the complete guess

224
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.109
P22: of which one I go to, because I have no idea.

225
00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:46.720
Moderator: Got it.

226
00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.789
P22: So that was very confusing. I would give that a 1.

227
00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.150
Moderator: Okay, thank you.

228
00:18:54.560 --> 00:19:00.739
Moderator: And I guess, what does the term primary caregiver mean to you as you're at this point of the application.

229
00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:04.399
P22: Yeah, that would be the person who takes care of me.

230
00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:13.750
P22: so I didn't, since I didn't know about secondary or whatever, I would just put my mom because she's the person does all the work.

231
00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:14.870
Moderator: Got it.

232
00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:17.820
P22: So.

233
00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:18.490
Moderator: Just

234
00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:19.870
Moderator: what about that?

235
00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:22.219
P22: Click down on the learn. More.

236
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:24.670
Moderator: Got it.

237
00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:31.210
P22: other relative.

238
00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:40.090
P22: So the the primary one is easy. I would pick my mom because she's my primary.

239
00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.060
Moderator: Okay, yeah, let's go through a scenario where you're

240
00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:47.440
Moderator: adding her. Then.

241
00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:48.650
Moderator: yes.

242
00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:53.249
Moderator: curious. If you were completing this form for real.

243
00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:56.190
Moderator: would she be here with you to help you fill this out.

244
00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:57.820
P22: Oh, most definitely.

245
00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.410
P22: most definitely.

246
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:05.879
P22: we'd still be arguing over which Va.

247
00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:07.252
P22: are we go to?

248
00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:11.010
P22: Okay?

249
00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:24.020
P22: Okay, okay.

250
00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:29.459
P22: so this part's easy. I'm I'm good here.

251
00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:38.309
P22: I'm making up a number because I don't know.

252
00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:45.070
Moderator: If you were doing that for real, you said she'd be here with you, so.

253
00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:47.789
P22: Yeah, she would know she would know.

254
00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.240
P22: Mother.

255
00:20:51.300 --> 00:21:04.680
P22: Okay, this, this dropdown box answers a question I was I was having, which was if I were doing a secondary one. Could my sister be that? And this answered that for me.

256
00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:08.240
P22: that's kind of why I pause right there

257
00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:10.160
P22: just.

258
00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:10.780
Moderator: So much for feedback.

259
00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:11.500
P22: Anyone

260
00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:13.670
P22: who all qualify and.

261
00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.970
Moderator: But I can give you another. Fake one here.

262
00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:23.159
P22: Yeah, do it?

263
00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.209
Moderator: 3, 2, 1,

264
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.880
Moderator: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8.

265
00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:34.820
P22: Okay.

266
00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:38.000
P22: Yes. Same address.

267
00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:46.240
P22: Home address. Yes.

268
00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:50.400
P22: Okay, that was good. That was easy.

269
00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:51.350
P22: Okay.

270
00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.050
P22: all this mail copy.

271
00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:59.310
P22: Okay. Okay.

272
00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:07.829
P22: Okay. I see now

273
00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:11.089
P22: that I'm seeing this page for the second time.

274
00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:12.595
P22: that

275
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:16.460
P22: the email is optional.

276
00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:20.779
P22: but having something on there

277
00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:25.710
P22: that says the second number, and the email is optional would be helpful.

278
00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:28.150
Moderator: Got it.

279
00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:42.090
P22: Okay.

280
00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:49.729
Moderator: Yeah. Now, the secondary caregiver is learning about this concept for the 1st time. What does a secondary caregiver mean to you?

281
00:22:51.610 --> 00:23:00.819
P22: I would I would guess that the secondary caregiver would be the person who steps in when, like my mom's asleep, or needs a break or something.

282
00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:03.460
Moderator: Got it.

283
00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:09.149
Moderator: Do you think the secondary role differs in the application process and benefits

284
00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:11.169
Moderator: from the primary caregiver role.

285
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:17.589
P22: I was getting ready to ask that question. Actually, I don't know.

286
00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:20.230
P22: I would.

287
00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:24.330
P22: I would like more information on this page like.

288
00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:29.480
P22: what is the secondary caregiver, and what do they qualify for?

289
00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:33.470
P22: Like? What's what's the point of having a secondary.

290
00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:38.409
Moderator: Got it. Thank you for that feedback. That's helpful.

291
00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:40.389
P22: Yeah, cause I'm I'm like.

292
00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:46.130
P22: does the secondary person get any benefits, do they?

293
00:23:46.594 --> 00:23:50.409
P22: Is, is it needed for me to state that

294
00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:55.709
P22: if my mom runs to the grocery store, my sister is the one who stays with me.

295
00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:02.070
P22: like, I need a lot more information on this page.

296
00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:03.340
Moderator: Got it.

297
00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:04.200
Moderator: Yeah.

298
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:05.930
Moderator: thank you for explaining that.

299
00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:15.610
Moderator: And for this scenario, let's go through like you're gonna add an additional. They're gonna add a secondary caregiver. You can feel free to make up some fake information if you need to.

300
00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:16.770
P22: Okay.

301
00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:43.930
P22: that's right.

302
00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.079
P22: Okay, this page was easy to pull out.

303
00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:56.260
P22: but I would still be sucked on the previous page trying to figure out, what's the point of a secondary.

304
00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:00.480
P22: that's what's still lingering in my head.

305
00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:10.359
Moderator: You do? Another 1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7,

306
00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:12.040
Moderator: 8, 7.

307
00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:15.650
Moderator: I think that's 9, is it?

308
00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:17.319
P22: Oh, it worked!

309
00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:26.360
P22: Now, here's another question I have on this page

310
00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:34.040
P22: the secondary caregiver do they have? Would they have to live with me too, or just come over. My primary is not there.

311
00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:35.720
P22: or

312
00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:37.730
P22: how does that work.

313
00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:40.789
Moderator: Yeah, is that not clear?

314
00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:41.370
P22: No.

315
00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:42.430
Moderator: Page at all.

316
00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:43.589
P22: Not at all.

317
00:25:44.093 --> 00:25:55.419
P22: I know earlier, they said. The primary has to live with the veteran, but I I don't have enough information about this whole secondary one.

318
00:25:57.150 --> 00:25:57.540
Moderator: Got it.

319
00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:06.289
P22: I mean, I'm just. I'm just filling it out because my sister does live with me. But I would. I would need to know. Know like, does that matter?

320
00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:11.599
P22: Can they be a secondary if they only come over when my primary is gone.

321
00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:15.580
P22: like.

322
00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:16.949
Moderator: Helpful feedback.

323
00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:22.189
P22: Yeah, I I need a whole little section on what the secondary caregiver is.

324
00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:23.800
Moderator: Okay.

325
00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:29.580
P22: Okay.

326
00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:35.460
P22: phone, number.

327
00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:46.389
Moderator: I know he had mentioned, you'd be filling this form out with your mom, your primary caregiver.

328
00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:50.380
Moderator: Would you do the same thing with the secondary. Would they be there with you

329
00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:51.980
Moderator: when you were filling it out.

330
00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:56.279
P22: Probably not. It'd probably just be me and my mom as my primary

331
00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:02.130
P22: but we would

332
00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:06.790
P22: hold on. Let me read this.

333
00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:10.370
P22: Search the backups.

334
00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:15.240
P22: Okay, so this little blurb right here.

335
00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:16.960
P22: I would.

336
00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:21.890
P22: I would prefer, if it was given earlier in the process, the secondary.

337
00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:29.979
P22: and also if it was expanded upon like, I still have questions on what's the secondary?

338
00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:36.130
P22: So before I back on that page, where

339
00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:38.990
P22: do you want to register a secondary.

340
00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:44.230
P22: I'd want this information plus more there.

341
00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:47.620
P22: because

342
00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:52.970
P22: we probably would have skipped the whole secondary thing. In fact, we did skip it

343
00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:57.780
P22: not. Probably we did skip it because we had no clue. What that meant.

344
00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:04.339
Moderator: That's really helpful feedback. Thank you for talking through that so much.

345
00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:12.300
P22: yeah.

346
00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:15.490
P22: I mean, I I don't have another secondary.

347
00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:16.890
P22: But

348
00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:21.010
P22: yeah, that this information would have been way helpful earlier.

349
00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:22.700
Moderator: Got it.

350
00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:29.239
Moderator: and you can go ahead and click no to the.

351
00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:29.660
P22: Okay.

352
00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:31.280
Moderator: Another one and continue.

353
00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:40.399
Moderator: Then, yeah, just in your own words, in your own words, describe this page and what it's asking you to do.

354
00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:42.435
P22: Okay?

355
00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:49.829
P22: it's asking me, who's going to be signing? Is it gonna be me, or is it going to be someone with legal

356
00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:52.510
P22: representation to sign for me.

357
00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:55.500
P22: Thank you.

358
00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:58.010
Moderator: Have someone who's a legal rep for you.

359
00:28:58.010 --> 00:28:59.440
P22: I I do not.

360
00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:02.120
P22: But

361
00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:08.020
P22: It's good to know if I needed it. I could get it.

362
00:29:12.953 --> 00:29:16.399
P22: So yeah, I would just say it's me signing for me.

363
00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:17.960
Moderator: Okay.

364
00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:22.160
P22: Oh, okay.

365
00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:28.090
Moderator: Yeah, so please look over this page and just tell me your initial impressions or expectations. You see here.

366
00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:33.120
P22: That itty, bitty, teeny, tiny expand all

367
00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:37.680
P22: would. I would like that bigger, because I just saw that by chance.

368
00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:39.040
Moderator: Okay.

369
00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:42.480
P22: I would I would use that button.

370
00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:45.950
P22: But Jesus, teeny tiny.

371
00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:49.130
P22: I have to put my reading glasses on to see that.

372
00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:59.590
Moderator: If you saw something you entered by mistake. Can you show me how you go about correcting that.

373
00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:02.342
P22: Yeah, I would.

374
00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:03.990
P22: edit.

375
00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:11.409
P22: And then update.

376
00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:13.860
P22: yeah, like that.

377
00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:15.650
Moderator: Thank you.

378
00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:25.910
P22: Okay.

379
00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:36.450
P22: at this point in time, I'd still be worried if I picked the right medical center.

380
00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:41.580
P22: And

381
00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:46.840
P22: yeah.

382
00:30:53.670 --> 00:30:58.459
P22: yeah, before I would submit this form right now.

383
00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:00.650
P22: I would have to call the Va.

384
00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:02.600
P22: Got it

385
00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:04.050
P22: mostly just.

386
00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:06.010
Moderator: Confirm your facility.

387
00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:11.300
P22: Yeah, like I, I would still be stressing over did I pick the right facility.

388
00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:15.589
Moderator: It's helpful feedback. Thanks for sharing that.

389
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:16.750
P22: No problem.

390
00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:30.719
P22: and then, when I get here, I'd still be confused about the secondary. What! What am I applying for?

391
00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:32.489
P22: What benefits

392
00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:35.170
P22: am I applying for?

393
00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:49.359
P22: I mean, I have that question in general like like, Do I want to go back and add my sister on there? I mean, does she qualify for benefits? What benefits?

394
00:31:55.390 --> 00:32:00.239
P22: yeah, I would. I would be stressing over those 2 things right now, if this is real, okay.

395
00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:04.850
P22: like it would, it would definitely agitate my stress level?

396
00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:10.750
P22: Nothing.

397
00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:13.179
Moderator: The point you'd be wanting to call the Va. Or.

398
00:32:13.290 --> 00:32:18.030
P22: Oh, yeah, I would. I would. There's no way I'd be submitting this form right now.

399
00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:24.539
P22: I'd be going back looking. I'd be clicking the back button to go back to that 1st page if you need help.

400
00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:25.870
Moderator: Got it.

401
00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:35.803
P22: because I would I would that would, even though this is fake. It's bothering me.

402
00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:48.679
Moderator: I guess any other thoughts you have on this page, as you kind of look towards the bottom of it.

403
00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:55.950
P22: no, no, this is just signing and

404
00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:59.049
P22: and saying it's there.

405
00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:02.270
P22: Everything's truthful.

406
00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:12.639
P22: family, primary family caregiver, applicant statement of truth.

407
00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:21.800
Moderator: Yeah, I guess. What's your comfort level with filling out and signing this information? Would everyone be present.

408
00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:26.019
P22: Yes, everyone would would be present at this point in time.

409
00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:38.119
P22: oh, okay, I see. It took me scrolling down to see who's signing this to realize that this was for my caregiver.

410
00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:40.719
Moderator: Got it. That wasn't clear.

411
00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:46.180
P22: No, not at all. I'm like, are they asking for me that information again?

412
00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:51.880
P22: Or, yeah, that was not clear until I got to

413
00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:58.369
P22: the primary family caregivers full name that that was for her to sign.

414
00:33:58.880 --> 00:33:59.550
Moderator: Got it.

415
00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:07.530
P22: And now that I know that I know the secondary, this is the secondary one to sign.

416
00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:11.929
P22: So at this point in time, I'd be like. Oh, crap! Where's my sister?

417
00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:17.420
Moderator: Got it. Yeah, she said earlier, you'd be okay if she wasn't there.

418
00:34:17.429 --> 00:34:20.399
P22: Right, and now I realize she would need to be here.

419
00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:22.080
Moderator: Okay.

420
00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:27.400
P22: So yeah, somewhere somewhere in there

421
00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:33.630
P22: I I would need someone to tell me that she needed to be here versus getting all the way to the end, and being like.

422
00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:36.179
P22: Oh, she's at work! Great

423
00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:41.999
P22: do I illegally click the box for her, or do I wait till she gets home?

424
00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:46.409
Moderator: Got it. That's really helpful feedback. Thanks for sharing that.

425
00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:47.939
P22: No problem.

426
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:54.330
Moderator: Actually, if you submit it today, we're in our test site so it won't work and it won't go anywhere but.

427
00:34:54.659 --> 00:34:55.469
P22: Okay,

428
00:34:56.309 --> 00:34:58.049
P22: the need help part.

429
00:34:58.649 --> 00:35:02.219
P22: That would be helpful to have at the beginning of this page.

430
00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:03.529
Moderator: Got it.

431
00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:07.669
P22: Because I would have hit that back button

432
00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:09.659
P22: a million times already.

433
00:35:10.512 --> 00:35:15.490
P22: And I wouldn't have gotten all the way down to the bottom to see the back space right there.

434
00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:20.480
P22: Way up here

435
00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:24.719
P22: where it's the the facility thing.

436
00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:28.584
P22: I would be hitting the back button on the

437
00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:30.610
P22: on the web page

438
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:33.330
P22: to go to the beginning

439
00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:37.700
P22: all over, and which would probably reset everything and really tick me off.

440
00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:43.590
P22: But I would be hitting that backspace button to get to that phone number

441
00:35:44.090 --> 00:35:45.630
P22: of I need help.

442
00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:52.760
Moderator: Got it. That's really helpful feedback, and thank you for explaining it so well, too.

443
00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:54.970
P22: No problem. Yeah, cause that

444
00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:58.389
P22: I would have to refill out the whole form.

445
00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:00.120
Moderator: Yeah.

446
00:36:00.250 --> 00:36:01.540
Moderator: that's frustrating.

447
00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:04.214
P22: Yes, that would have really sucked.

448
00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:17.640
P22: But yeah, I would definitely put somewhere earlier, your secondary needs to be there if you're applying and the need help stuff cause it didn't even cross my mind to go in the bottom of the document

449
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:21.019
P22: to hit the back button or to

450
00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.970
P22: look at for that phone number that I need help.

451
00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:28.579
Moderator: Got it. That's really helpful feedback. Thank you.

452
00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:35.350
Moderator: Okay. If there's nothing else you wanted to add on this page, I was gonna share a screen. What would

453
00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:37.340
Moderator: look like if you hit? Submit.

454
00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:38.970
P22: Okay.

455
00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:41.019
Moderator: Okay, so let me

456
00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:44.800
Moderator: share screen.

457
00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:50.370
P22: Do I need to stop? Oh, I gotta stop saving, or something, because that's really tiny.

458
00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:54.110
P22: How do I do that? Oh, wait! There it goes. Nope! It's gone!

459
00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:57.469
Moderator: Can you see the screen? Now? Is it okay?

460
00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:59.130
P22: It says.

461
00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:03.750
P22: Oh, okay, okay, hold on. Okay. Yes. Now I can see it.

462
00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:04.720
Moderator: Okay.

463
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:10.410
Moderator: I'm gonna scroll through this. Let me know if you need me to go slower or faster, or pause.

464
00:37:10.410 --> 00:37:11.200
P22: See if that's.

465
00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:11.910
Moderator: No.

466
00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:17.740
P22: All right.

467
00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:19.649
P22: Confirmation number.

468
00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:25.070
P22: Okay, I would totally be hitting print this page right here.

469
00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:26.640
Moderator: Got it.

470
00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:40.350
Moderator: I don't know if I need to slow down at all.

471
00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:42.520
P22: Okay, now you're good.

472
00:37:54.010 --> 00:37:55.410
P22: This is why

473
00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:02.030
P22: so right here?

474
00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:07.729
P22: where it says, what can you do if your application is denied and stuff.

475
00:38:09.015 --> 00:38:12.489
P22: This currently has me wondering

476
00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:17.600
P22: if I were to go and add my sister back on with that

477
00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:22.319
P22: reset my entire process of having applied for

478
00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:23.700
P22: the caregiver

479
00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:25.180
P22: program

480
00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:31.200
P22: that just triggered questions in my head about my real application.

481
00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:36.659
P22: cause I didn't put my sister on there. So

482
00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:38.939
P22: does that restart everything.

483
00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:42.500
P22: Yeah.

484
00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:44.949
Moderator: Would you need here to kind of help with that.

485
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:48.629
P22: that number there. It is.

486
00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:49.810
P22: Okay.

487
00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:53.779
P22: The call caregiver support line.

488
00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:57.409
P22: Yeah, right? There.

489
00:38:59.390 --> 00:39:01.300
P22: that's what I would do. I would call them.

490
00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:02.540
Moderator: Okay.

491
00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:07.890
Moderator: any other

492
00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:11.379
Moderator: thoughts or kind of what feedback on this page.

493
00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:18.009
P22: Oh, there's another! I I totally missed that. What to do if you have questions now.

494
00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:21.630
Moderator: I may have been scrolling too fast. Sorry.

495
00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:25.270
P22: That's okay. Yeah. I would be calling that number at this point in time.

496
00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:26.580
Moderator: Okay.

497
00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:32.659
Moderator: And I guess if you had a magic wand, how would you want this page to work for? You?

498
00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:39.890
P22: I think I would like the what to do if you have questions now

499
00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:42.230
P22: to be a little higher up.

500
00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:43.880
Moderator: Got it.

501
00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:47.720
P22: because

502
00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.480
P22: I would have questions

503
00:39:52.400 --> 00:40:02.159
P22: once again. And maybe it's just because I I lack impatience. Maybe I would be trying to figure out what that phone number was. Again.

504
00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:04.380
Moderator: Got it

505
00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:09.240
Moderator: anything else on this confirmation page.

506
00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:11.609
P22: No, that's about it.

507
00:40:12.690 --> 00:40:13.820
Moderator: Okay, cool.

508
00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:21.510
Moderator: Well, thank you for your feedback on that. I'm going to stop sharing now, and I have a couple wrap up questions before we end. Today.

509
00:40:21.730 --> 00:40:22.210
P22: Okay.

510
00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:27.589
Moderator: Curious. What research would you do before applying and completing a form like this?

511
00:40:31.690 --> 00:40:34.930
P22: I would still be stuck on that whole secondary caregiver thing.

512
00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:36.670
P22: And

513
00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:48.510
P22: and I mean to be honest, I didn't. I didn't never made it past the page. That was where your clinic is. I would have had to call for help right then. There.

514
00:40:49.777 --> 00:40:55.060
P22: I don't know if I would have called the actual Va. I go to

515
00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:56.889
P22: and be like.

516
00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:00.890
P22: Which clinic is this one of these 3?

517
00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:05.219
P22: Or if I had called the if you need help. With this form.

518
00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:09.199
Moderator: Okay? So that wasn't clear which one would be the best route.

519
00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:10.630
P22: Right.

520
00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:15.819
P22: and then, by the time I got to the secondary thing.

521
00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:18.839
P22: I I would be calling again.

522
00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:20.210
Moderator: Got it.

523
00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:21.770
P22: And

524
00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:29.639
P22: then I would have never got the form submitted, because my sister would be at work, and I would need her here to sign that last page.

525
00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:35.169
P22: So that would have been nice to know earlier on the process, something that says

526
00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:39.129
P22: all caregivers must be present to fill out this form.

527
00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:40.880
P22: because I don't think

528
00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:47.490
P22: I I think, because whenever I fill a form, I have my mom there, that's just habitual for us.

529
00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:55.940
P22: But I think if it wasn't habitual for us to do that. I would have started filling out the form and then been like, Oh, crap! I need my mom.

530
00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:57.540
Moderator: Got it.

531
00:41:58.251 --> 00:42:01.239
P22: Just like I was with the oh, I need my sister.

532
00:42:03.010 --> 00:42:04.870
Moderator: It's very helpful thanks for sharing that

533
00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:17.310
Moderator: you talked about this a little bit already, so I think I know where you might lean on this question. But what are your thoughts about the amount of information provided in the form? Do you think it was too much too little, or just enough.

534
00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:18.520
P22: Too little.

535
00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:27.729
P22: too little. I I need. I would need more information because I I couldn't fill the form up without calling for help.

536
00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:28.810
Moderator: Got it.

537
00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:36.980
Moderator: You talked about this some. What additional information would you want around who qualifies as a primary and secondary caregiver.

538
00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:44.960
P22: Yeah, I'd like definitions of of that something that explains. And then also, what benefits

539
00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:50.960
P22: the secondary gets versus the primary. Is it worth putting a secondary on there.

540
00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:55.360
P22: cause. I still won't have the answer to that question.

541
00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:58.239
P22: even after going through the whole form.

542
00:42:59.030 --> 00:42:59.710
Moderator: Got it.

543
00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:04.180
Moderator: Anything else you want to add about what we talked about today.

544
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:10.849
P22: no, we pretty much went over every all the questions that I would have.

545
00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:11.950
Moderator: Okay?

546
00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:25.510
Moderator: So I just want to circle back and reconfirm. Are you comfortable if we decide to share a video clip of this session with our Va. Partners, so they can better understand veterans experiences, or remove any identifiable information. Of course.

547
00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:27.269
P22: Yeah, I'm fine with that.

548
00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:27.795
Moderator: Okay.

549
00:43:28.410 --> 00:43:38.780
Moderator: well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. That's all we have. So your feedback is really helpful as we continue to iterate and work on the site so it could be better for veterans and caregivers

550
00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:40.830
Moderator: a lot of work to do.

551
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:51.170
Moderator: and lastly, pregn the one that signed you up for this, they'll be sending you a thank you. Note with a blurb, and you can pass that along to other veterans. You might know who want to participate in studies like this.

552
00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:53.110
P22: Okay. Cool. Cool. Well.

553
00:43:53.110 --> 00:43:55.550
Moderator: Thank you so much again, and I hope you have a great day.

554
00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:56.660
P22: Thanks, bye.

555
00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:57.540
Moderator: Bye.
