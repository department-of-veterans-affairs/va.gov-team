72
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:36.750
Moderator: Maybe

73
00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.600

77
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.489
Moderator: That is our test site that we're gonna go through today. So once you have that opened

78
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.670
Moderator: and how are ready? Then we can kind of share screen, so we can see what you're doing on that.

79
00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:15.278
P32: Apply for for the program of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers. Would that be it? Okay.

81
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:26.080
Moderator: Yeah, can you share your screen? Your video froze, by the way, but I still hear you just fine.

82
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.255
P32: Little.

83
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.190
P32: How can I do that?

84
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:34.270
P32: We do?

85
00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.380
P32: Hmm!

86
00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:39.810
P32: One moment.

87
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.770
P32: Hmm!

88
00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.680
Moderator: Video is back. But I don't see screen share.

89
00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:03.040
P32: So

90
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:04.509
P32: you see me.

91
00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.680
P32: Oh.

92
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.619
Moderator: Now the video froze again. Yes, it moved for a minute, but it froze on my end.

93
00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.410
Moderator: I hear you just fine still, so.

94
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.920
Moderator: I think as long as we can hear you and get the screen share working we are good to keep moving forward.

95
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.140
P32: Okay, there's a start. Your application. Would that be it?

96
00:06:34.184 --> 00:06:44.879
Moderator: Nope, you want to go back to the zoom to look for that share content button. So within the zoom window, zoom application, you should have a share, content, or start broadcast. Button.

97
00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:54.409
P32: You know.

98
00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:56.679
Moderator: Yeah, it's usually like a

99
00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.860
Moderator: box with an up arrow

100
00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.549
Moderator: that says, share content. When you're on the iphone.

101
00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.500
P32: The box with the arrow. Yep.

102
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.870
P32: okay. Well, to whom do I share it with options?

103
00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.680
Moderator: Yeah, you could chat, share the screen.

104
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:33.810
Moderator: and then it should prompt you to say, start broadcast.

105
00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:38.229
P32: At the home screen.

106
00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:40.529
Moderator: Yep, in zoom

107
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.659
Moderator: from that share content, button.

108
00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:03.060
P32: I see you. This is Jessica, moderator.

109
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:08.290
Moderator: And then at the bottom is there like the share content

110
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:10.839
Moderator: box with the arrow.

111
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:17.130
Moderator: and then it should give you some options, and you want to choose the top one that says, screen.

112
00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:21.660
P32: Oh, boy.

113
00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:27.609
P32: it's telling me to send to you. Is that it?

114
00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:33.070
Moderator: That shouldn't be it. That would be back in chat.

115
00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:42.429
Moderator: It's just in the main zoom settings. You'll have to kind of close out the chat window. It sounds like you're in that.

116
00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:45.259
P32: On the chat.

117
00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:47.750
P32: Yeah, close. Yep.

118
00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:51.659
Moderator: Close out the chat and zoom, and then go to oh.

119
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.079
Moderator: and he's gone!

120
00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.080
Moderator: Give it a second

121
00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:03.180
Moderator: points.

122
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:05.730
Moderator: Hit the wrong button. When he went to

123
00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:08.040
Moderator: click more. Editor.

124
00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:10.580
Notetaker (Angela): Yeah, that's easy to do.

125
00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:11.510
Notetaker (Angela): But

126
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:17.529
Notetaker (Angela): I think you might be right that like, if it's saying to share with you.

127
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:19.910
Notetaker (Angela): maybe that is the chat

128
00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:23.870
Notetaker (Angela): I was thinking he was just trying to share

129
00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:31.020
Notetaker (Angela): like a link on his phone, or something cause that usually like, do you want to send it to, but that sounds more

130
00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.239
Notetaker (Angela): likely that he was in the chat.

131
00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.469
Moderator: And he's back already. Okay, let's try again.

132
00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:46.790
Moderator: Hello.

133
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:48.500
P32: Alright Jessica.

134
00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:49.546
Moderator: No worries.

135
00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.599
P32: Sorry I'm having. I'm having trouble on this, and I even disconnected.

136
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:57.280
Moderator: -Oh, okay.

137
00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.430
P32: Kind of sideways.

138
00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:02.509
Moderator: So say, Yeah, it is sideways now, but.

139
00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:05.969
P32: Do nothing. That's the same position. It was earlier.

140
00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:07.100
Moderator: Okay.

141
00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:13.750
Moderator: yeah, I don't know if we can get the screen sharing to work.

142
00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:25.970
Moderator: Okay, I'm gonna put the link back in chat because what was there before, probably went away on you? Unless do you have that window open in your browser? Because then maybe we don't even have to mess with chat. If you still have it opened

143
00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:27.150
Moderator: to

144
00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:32.789
Moderator: do, you still have it opened in like safari. Probably if you're on an iphone.

145
00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:43.329
P32: No, I'm I'm gonna go there. Okay. Where do you want me to go now? Okay, I'm at where it says, Start your application, or

146
00:10:43.963 --> 00:10:50.119
P32: that's what's getting me. And then down there's a square with an arrow in in the middle. That's where you want.

147
00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:56.250
Moderator: Yep, hit that square with the arrow that points up, and it should ask you if you want to share content.

148
00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:59.290
Moderator: and you want to say, share the screen.

149
00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:26.510
P32: Wait a second. I'm hungry.

150
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:39.080
Moderator: Do you see the share screen button? Or is that not working.

151
00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:47.340
P32: I thought I was. I was doing it. But it's like it's right there. Send to Moderator, which is you, Jessica, and that's all. That's where I'm at right now.

152
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.060
Moderator: Click that and see what it does. I'm wondering.

153
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.890
P32: It, says Jessica. Jessica host.

154
00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:06.630
P32: It says on the bottom, who can see your message recording on.

155
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:09.689
Moderator: Okay, that's the chat window for sure.

156
00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:11.990
P32: So you want me to close it.

157
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:13.410
Moderator: Yep. Close that out.

158
00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:17.510
P32: Okay. I'm back up on the sideway.

159
00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:23.649
Moderator: Okay? And then so at the bottom, do you see? Kind of like a microphone, a video.

160
00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:27.230
P32: Yes, yes. Stop. Video participants.

161
00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:33.380
Moderator: Is there a 1 in the middle that has, like a box with an arrow? It should say, share content.

162
00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.949
Moderator: It should be right between the start, stop video and the participants.

163
00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:45.150
P32: Chat. It says chat and a little heart reaction share.

164
00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:49.217
P32: Okay? Then I do it screen

165
00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:55.140
P32: and then start back. Start.

166
00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:55.840
Moderator: Yes.

167
00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:57.339
Moderator: that is correct.

P32: Boy, what did I do wrong?

172
00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:10.680

176
00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:24.210
Moderator: that link that was sent to staging that page that had to start your application.

177
00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:27.189
Moderator: Can you go to that.

178
00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:29.169
P32: Sharing the screen, including notebook.

179
00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:30.690
P32: Where do you say?

180
00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.240
P32: Okay, it's telling me.

181
00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:45.219
Moderator: Yeah, you're sharing zoom screen now. So if you can go and open up that link that was in chat.

182
00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:50.470
Moderator: yep, if you just want to click on that.

183

P32: That's it.

184
00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:53.459
Moderator: We did it. We're here.

188
00:13:58.180 --> 00:13:58.980
Moderator: Okay.

189
00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:00.500
P32: Sorry.

190
00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.420
Moderator: No worries at all. This is fine.

191
00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:06.549
Moderator: Yeah, it's not easy to share on Mobile sometimes at all.

192
00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:07.620
P32: Alright!

193
00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:17.739
Moderator: Okay. So now that we're here, if you could just kind of look through this page and think aloud, and just tell me about your initial thoughts and expectations of what you see here.

194
00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:22.079
P32: Okay, you want me to open where it says the application or.

195
00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:25.769
Moderator: Yeah, just kind of talk through what you would normally do if you were

196
00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:27.889
Moderator: applying for real.

197
00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:36.990
P32: Okay, yeah, would read the instructions up on the top. Veterans can also use this caregivers at

198
00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:42.259
P32: after they apply. So I open, I would basically check my eligibility

199
00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:47.950
P32: like, Find out. I would do that in 1st instance, and to see if I qualify

200
00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.889
P32: right there.

201
00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:57.119
P32: Now, look like to see like, see? I had an idea that the social security

202
00:14:57.593 --> 00:15:03.950
P32: date of birth, address, phone number, like I had expressed before, I had an idea about that.

203
00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:09.314
P32: What if I had any questions, I would be calling those numbers. And

204
00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:14.859
P32: then, when I, when I had a chance to start the application, I'll just go over there

205
00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.349
P32: and start. You want me to open it.

206
00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:19.810
Moderator: Yeah.

207
00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:24.809
Moderator: did anything on this page stand out to you as being really confusing or really helpful?

208
00:15:25.841 --> 00:15:30.019
P32: Okay, now, what do what would you like for me to do? There.

209
00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:36.279
Moderator: Yeah. Actually, I'm gonna pause you right here before we continue on. I'm just curious on that intro page.

210
00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:37.140
P32: The reason.

211
00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:45.579
Moderator: You could rate it on a scale of one to 5 of one being very poor and 5 being really well. How prepared and informed.

212
00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:49.880
Moderator: Do you feel about the application just based on that other page's content?

213
00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:53.810
P32: To be honest, we were number 5.

214
00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:54.990
P32: Okay.

215
00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.370
P32: the 5,

216
00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:58.770
Moderator: There a reason why.

217
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:03.769
P32: Oh, basically, it's asking me, you know, like

218
00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:07.039
P32: would like, where any application has

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:10.689
P32: self explanatory, easy thing to put in and

220
00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:14.250
P32: and go on with the next pages. Whatever applies

Moderator: Okay, great.

224
00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:33.330
Moderator: So yeah. Now, if you could start the application as if you were applying, and just kind of fill it in as you go. And just a reminder. This is our testing site. So you don't have to worry about your information going anywhere but

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:00.740
P32: okay, which is.

300
00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.590
P32: just go back and punch it in

301
00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:12.430
P32: is missing by 2 digits.

302
00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:17.259
P32: It's not. It's stopping. I don't know why.

303
00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:19.010
P32: That's the correct Zip code.

304
00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:27.980
P32: Where would it be? A center located may be different from the veterans. Home.

305
00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:29.020
P32: we'll see

306
00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:32.799
P32: like a medical center or clinic.

307
00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:57.090
P32: There we go.

308
00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:59.690
P32: Who's adding for the plus 4

309
00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:01.070
P32: you relieve it.

310
00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:06.312
P32: So that's always holding us up the plus 4, which is

311
00:25:08.203 --> 00:25:13.519
P32: I may even have the Lebanon one. So this will be it.

312
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:17.396
P32: That's all

313
00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:20.750
P32: purposely done by the post office.

314
00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:24.380
P32: and I would be continuing. Huh!

315
00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:28.890
Moderator: Oh, before we go on to this next section, can you go back for a second? Please.

316
00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:31.880
P32: Okay.

317
00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:38.609
Moderator: 2 questions. First, st can you just kind of walk me through this page and kind of explain what it means to you?

318
00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:45.600
P32: Okay, it means that my clinic would be located where it is right there in Wyomist, in Pennsylvania.

319
00:25:46.040 --> 00:26:04.199
P32: and that the the actual assigned caregiver support facility which I was assuming since the beginning would have been the Lebanon Va. Medical Center at the Lebanon, Pennsylvania, which is the main hospital closest

320
00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.249
P32: one of the closest other than Coach Bill.

321
00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:10.130
P32: That would be the one of my choice right now.

322
00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:14.999
P32: and that would be like letting me know that there would be, they would be the one supporting.

323
00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:18.920
P32: I will be the facility supporting the the caregivers

324
00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:21.579
P32: at this, at the at this location

325
00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:25.650
P32: 17 South Lincoln Avenue, Lebanon, PA.

326
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.709
P32: 1, 7, 0 4, 2

327
00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:34.630
P32: plus 4, which is a 7, 5, 2, 9. In order for me to contact. If I needed to write in anything.

328
00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:46.489
Moderator: Okay? Great, yeah. Thank you for talking through that page. And I'm curious on another scale question on the same one to 5 scale of one being poor and 5 being very well.

329
00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:52.009
Moderator: how would you rate the overall ability to search and find and select a facility.

330
00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:55.878
P32: Well, in regards to that, it was really

331
00:26:56.390 --> 00:27:00.920
P32: self-explanatory. I would give it then, between a 4 and a 5,

332
00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:03.370
P32: because if I like didn't like.

333
00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:09.039
P32: I give it in a little more in regards to the plus 4 which not normally

334
00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:14.990
P32: normally, that that plus 4 is related just mainly for the post office to

335
00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:22.049
P32: to allocate the the mails and the mailing and stuff they have.

336
00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:25.859
P32: and that will be something like not everybody knows, so

337
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:28.270
P32: I just took a wild guess on that.

338
00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:34.851
Moderator: It's really great feedback. Thank you. And you can continue on from here to the next section.

339
00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:42.820
P32: So then, would you like to apply for benefits? For a primary caregiver? Yes.

340
00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:44.950
P32: and it's required. So I

341
00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:46.090
P32: proceed.

342
00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:47.929
P32: what is the price.

343
00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:49.740
Moderator: Married caregiver mean to you?

344
00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:53.271
P32: But would be the Pcp. Which is the

345
00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:58.839
P32: the the one doctor that's in charge, like a general doctor of what's going on

346
00:28:00.858 --> 00:28:03.009
P32: with the patient and their needs.

347
00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:05.502
P32: That's the one that facilitates the

348
00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:10.520
P32: They need to see an a specialist or need a

349
00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:12.370
P32: any blood work.

350
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.579
P32: any assistant devices, and so on.

351
00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:22.470
P32: though that would be like the facilitator to make things easy for the veteran.

352
00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:27.510
P32: It should be the one the one that you would need to talk to 1st

353
00:28:28.135 --> 00:28:30.840
P32: in order to get in order to get what you need.

354
00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:33.150
Moderator: Got it.

355
00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:42.529
Moderator: So yeah, let's go through a scenario where you want to add a primary caregiver to this application. And just remember to think aloud about your thought process as you go.

356
00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:46.609
Moderator: I don't either.

357
00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:50.229
P32: Okay, so this would be the primary family. This will be the doctor.

358
00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:53.760
P32: Was that a fact.

359
00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:54.930
Moderator: Yeah, is that your

360
00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:57.250
Moderator: expectation or thoughts from this page.

361
00:28:58.090 --> 00:29:04.269
P32: Yes, the primary. The primary family's caregivers. 1st name would be Mary Ann.

362
00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:06.119
P32: You want me to fill it in?

363
00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:07.659
P32: Yep, go ahead.

364
00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:11.299
Moderator: You can use fake information if it's more comfortable. But yeah.

365
00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:26.200
P32: Well, let me take this area.

366
00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:36.870
P32: Hello.

367
00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:46.080
P32: Hi, how are you?

368
00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:28.030
P32: Yeah, that would be basically the information I would need for the person to be careful

369
00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:33.180
P32: and the social. We can go like more or less like what you told me.

370
00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:38.210
P32: Yeah.

371
00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:42.629
Moderator: If you were completing this form for real would your caregiver be with you to fill this out.

372
00:30:44.093 --> 00:30:48.679
P32: Not necessarily. If I have the information offhand.

373
00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:50.130
P32: Okay.

374
00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:53.600
P32: yes. Would would that be a valid answer?

375
00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:57.220
Moderator: The social. As long as it's 9 we can.

376
00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:57.990
P32: Yeah, it's fine.

377
00:30:57.990 --> 00:31:00.010
Moderator: Continue on 9 digits. Yeah.

378
00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:12.170
P32: I'm using the same

379
00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:15.187
P32: has to be the one on the whereabouts of

380
00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:18.559
P32: this particular person for the caregiver

381
00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:23.930
P32: mailing address, which is fine with me. It would be

382
00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:27.440
P32: willing to accept every any correspondence.

383
00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:30.209
P32: and then the number.

384
00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:41.459
P32: the alternate phone would be.

385
00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:53.240
P32: Hmm.

386
00:31:54.510 --> 00:32:01.410
P32: Then here would you apply for for a secondary. In this case I would not have just Marianne.

387
00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:06.030
Moderator: If what does a secondary caregiver mean to you?

388
00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:07.280
Moderator: Kind of go.

389
00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:07.960
P32: Secondary.

390
00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:08.290
Moderator: Age.

391
00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:09.319
P32: If I will.

392
00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:10.620
P32: You want to go back.

393
00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:15.370
Moderator: Yeah, I kind of want you to talk through a little bit of what a secondary caregiver is.

394
00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:18.759
P32: It could be her husband.

395
00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:22.100
Moderator: Okay?

396
00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:29.629
Moderator: And how do you think the secondary role differs in the application process and benefits from the primary caregiver.

397
00:32:30.690 --> 00:32:33.279
P32: It all depends. If they they're

398
00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:36.879
P32: they're entitled to the benefits as well as a veteran.

399
00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:39.320
Moderator: Okay?

400
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:48.270
Moderator: And I guess if you were completing this online form for real, how would you go about coordinating the information for the various caregivers.

401
00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:52.479
Moderator: Would you have it and know it offhand, or.

402
00:32:53.290 --> 00:32:58.190
P32: I would find out, and then I'll put it in when I'm sure that that would be the person.

403
00:32:58.830 --> 00:32:59.335
Moderator: Okay.

404
00:33:00.390 --> 00:33:03.419
Moderator: would you sit down and complete the form together?

405
00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:08.709
P32: Yes, yes, the person is able right there. Of course

406
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:12.389
P32: I'll probably go to the house and fill it out there.

407
00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:15.010
Moderator: Okay, great.

408
00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:17.610
Moderator: You can.

409
00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:19.689
P32: Are you on? Yep.

410
00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:22.889
Moderator: So, yeah, in your own work.

411
00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:23.320
P32: There's no.

412
00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:26.679
Moderator: Describe what this page is asking and what it means to you.

413
00:33:38.639 --> 00:33:39.290
P32: Okay.

414
00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:44.960
P32: okay.

415
00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:53.029
P32: this would be like a next, like a next of kin that would be

416
00:33:53.997 --> 00:33:59.469
P32: willing to sign and take over any decisions

417
00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:02.359
P32: or authorized by law

418
00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:11.499
P32: to to make the decisions and sign for any official or last minute decisions towards the patient.

419
00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:16.150
Moderator: Got it. Thanks for talking through that.

420
00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:19.370
Moderator: Do you have someone who's a legal representative for you?

421
00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:21.489
P32: My wife.

422
00:34:24.679 --> 00:34:26.679
Moderator: Yeah, if you could just go ahead and go through

423
00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:32.649
Moderator: how you would apply normally and just in your own words what you'd expect to happen next? After this question.

424
00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:47.529
P32: Okay, just in case, if it's my wife, that would be one of the one filling this application. She would be the one representing me, for instance, with the legal authority signing, and on behalf of me as a veteran.

425
00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:53.620
P32: I'm the veteran, and if I would be like, perhaps living alone, I'm I would be the one

426
00:34:53.860 --> 00:35:00.560
P32: if I would be able, of course, still, and not having, like any authorized person by law

427
00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:02.960
P32: or caregiver.

428
00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:05.089
P32: you know whatnot. And

429
00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:11.759
P32: and then I would be selecting either or depending the the situation I would be encountering at the time.

430
00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:17.410
Moderator: Got it. Thank you for talking through that. It's really helpful. Yeah, if you.

431
00:35:17.410 --> 00:35:18.110
P32: They just.

432
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:20.559
Moderator: Answer like you would if you were applying.

433
00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:23.449
P32: Oh, okay, let me go back.

434
00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:25.559
Moderator: And that's good.

435
00:35:25.958 --> 00:35:28.349
P32: Okay, so I will do that.

436
00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:31.885
P32: Upload your support documents here. I would be

437
00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:37.330
P32: if I have any documents to support the the

438
00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:40.100
P32: that's it.

439
00:35:42.823 --> 00:35:55.790
P32: The supported document that would be like, for instance, like a power of attorney, if I had not my wife, or, legally speaking, any document.

440
00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:58.409
P32: you know, with release that person

441
00:35:59.146 --> 00:36:10.140
P32: to whomever would need to know that would they would be the one responsible for making any final decisions, any chances of making any decisions at the moment.

442
00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:18.610
P32: And if there would be, there be any signatures required by that particular port person.

443
00:36:18.830 --> 00:36:32.659
P32: and it could be also as the one sole person that would be responsible for all. And through here I would just up upload the file. If I have it, let's say I'll be using my PC.

444
00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:40.959
P32: Or it could be easy. Also a photo from my iphone, or just snap a picture and upload it, using the upload file

445
00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:44.160
P32: and then hit, continue.

446
00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:55.949
P32: And it's specifying here how to upload. It's just letting me know various types of ways. I can do that like scan copy, take a photo and upload the image.

447
00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:56.865
P32: and

448
00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:06.370
P32: telling me that they can't accept like a cover a signature page without the rest of the document. It has to be complete.

449
00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:08.999
P32: One document after the other.

450
00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:20.140
Moderator: Got it. Great. That's really helpful feedback. Thank you for talking through that. So well, we won't actually upload a file since we're in our test site. So if you could just kinda go back

451
00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:25.850
Moderator: if you want to hit the back button and then kind of say.

452
00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:29.530
Moderator: select the other option of the veteran, signing for myself.

453
00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:31.689
P32: Oh, I'm sorry!

454
00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:33.640
P32: Alright!

455
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:36.040
Moderator: Yeah, that's not.

456
00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:37.249
P32: On this page.

457
00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:38.140
P32: Okay,

458
00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:43.140
Moderator: Go ahead, I was. Gonna say, look it over, and just tell me your thoughts and expectations of what you see here.

459
00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:52.929
P32: So you have the application for the program. Comprehensive assistant for Family Givers. Okay, which is the 10 dash. 10 cg. Charlie golf.

460
00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:57.010
P32: I would review the application here.

461
00:37:57.390 --> 00:38:12.090
P32: start off for the veterans. Information so and so. Last name, 1st name, and whatever applies social security, the address, if it's accurate or correct, and and the county he lives in.

462
00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:22.529
P32: and so on. Any Medical center, you know, just overall looking at the email, which is correct would would be receiving the emails, and so on.

463
00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:45.620
P32: and the facility selected in regards to the county he lives, which would be the clinic at the Wyoming like I spoke before about, and that the caregiver support facility would be located. The correct one would be then the one I would have chose would be in the one at Lebanon, Va. Medical Center. So then I proceed to go to the primary caregivers applicant

464
00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:49.920
P32: says, here, would you like to apply for benefits

465
00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:53.512
P32: for a primary. Yes. Okay. So then,

466
00:38:54.600 --> 00:39:06.080
P32: here's the information for the caregiver. Information would be Mary Ann patillo. And then I proceed the day she. She was born a female sister.

467
00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:10.099
P32: That's the way, and social security, and so on. And

468
00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:14.449
P32: it's the same as the address that I have as the

469
00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:16.619
P32: the person receiving

470
00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:20.940
P32: primary care's phone number, and so on. And

471
00:39:21.050 --> 00:39:22.630
P32: the email.

472
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:26.280
P32: it would would be different. I would assume it would be here.

473
00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:31.550
P32: since it's the same above. So then, the secondary, there's none.

474
00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:37.419
P32: So then would you like to apply for a secondary caregiver?

475
00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:42.499
P32: We just decided in this case to leave it like as is no.

476
00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:44.096
P32: So then,

477
00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:48.880
P32: hero at the end would be the veteran statement of truth

478
00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:53.194
P32: that certifies that anything that I'll be rendering there is

479
00:39:53.850 --> 00:40:06.611
P32: under the that in that the person will be under my care, and consent to sharing the information necessary to be having to involve their care, and any payment relate related

480
00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:12.190
P32: healthcare, or needed, as whatever purposes they might need

481
00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:13.599
P32: for the moment.

482
00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:22.140
P32: Then I would just put the veterans full name, I certify so and so. This is correct and true, best of my knowledge and belief.

483
00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:24.899
P32: So then I mark here, after I sign it.

484
00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:29.059
P32: I just put these letters in it.

485
00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:33.661
P32: Well, that's not accepting.

486
00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:37.639
P32: Will I put any name or.

487
00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:41.529
Moderator: Yeah, what is your expectation of what you

488
00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:42.970
Moderator: need to do? There.

489
00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:44.320
P32: Okay.

490
00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:47.140
P32: I will put the name.

491
00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:01.980
P32: Hi, how are you?

492
00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:06.460
Moderator: Yeah, what's your comfort level of filling and signing out the information

493
00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:09.000
Moderator: here? If all the people weren't present.

494
00:41:10.350 --> 00:41:10.960
P32: If

495
00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:22.260
P32: if it's good to, I mean if I see it, it is confident, being that this is an official document to fill out as an application.

496
00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:26.140
P32: I wouldn't hesitate to fill it out and sign it and send it in.

497
00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:27.320
Moderator: Okay.

498
00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:31.369
P32: No, just do it. I just follow the instructions on.

499
00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:32.600
P32: proceed with it.

500
00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:35.729
P32: and see what happens at the end.

501
00:41:36.730 --> 00:41:38.399
P32: If it's approved or not.

502
00:41:42.970 --> 00:41:50.139
Moderator: And anything else on this page that you would do before submitting. We'll stop you before you do that piece. But

503
00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:58.810
Moderator: I'm curious if you saw something you entered by mistake.

504
00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:02.470
Moderator: How would you go about correcting that from this page.

505
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.049
P32: I'll go back.

509
00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:21.290
Moderator: Nope, don't submit. It won't work in our testing site. It won't actually go anywhere. So I'm actually gonna

510
00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:23.730
Moderator: pause you there and.

511
00:43:23.730 --> 00:43:24.489
P32: It comes up.

512
00:43:24.490 --> 00:43:25.719
Moderator: The screen share.

513
00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:30.200
Moderator: Okay.

514
00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:38.750
Moderator: okay? So now, we're just going to. Since we're in the testing site. Imagine you hit the Submit application button.

515
00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:43.740
Moderator: And you. Do you see my screen, that I'm sharing.

516
00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:45.590
P32: Yes.

517
00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:46.680
Moderator: Okay.

518
00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:52.120
Moderator: I was gonna kind of scroll like scroll through this page very slowly. Let me know if I need to speed up or go slower, or whatever.

519
00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:52.490
P32: Thank you.

520
00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:56.020
Moderator: And just kind of share any feedback you have on this last page.

00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:05.829
P32: Your submission. Okay? Who submitted? Okay. Applicant signature. Okay? They submitted, and so on.

522
00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:15.280
P32: I would be having to do with that. And then, when I'm done checking all of that information, I could have the opportunity to print it from my own records

523
00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:17.669
P32: that it would submit it

524
00:44:18.170 --> 00:44:23.949
P32: download, and this application would be completed through the application of Pdf.

525
00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:29.708
P32: And then a member of the care gear would be

526
00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:34.220
P32: contacting me in regards to this application.

527
00:44:35.890 --> 00:44:40.100
P32: and I would be receiving a confirmation through the information on my email.

528
00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:43.702
P32: And if I

529
00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:53.749
P32: at a chance, did not have an opportunity to put in due to the fact that I might have not had the email. I have a chance to call back at the number.

530
00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:57.800
P32: and if I have any questions. I will be

531
00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:01.430
P32: calling the support team at the caregiver.

532
00:45:01.830 --> 00:45:03.989
P32: Okay? And then the numbers are there.

533
00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:07.770
P32: and if the application was denied

534
00:45:08.246 --> 00:45:12.290
P32: they would be sending me a letter of explanation, I would say

535
00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:17.720
P32: why it was denied, and if there's any disagreement on my behalf.

536
00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:21.750
P32: I can appeal and request a review for this decision.

537
00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:23.446
P32: and then,

538
00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:27.540
P32: they'll again will review it.

539
00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:29.889
P32: and then allow

540
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:36.276
P32: they also give me other ways of going around, of getting the

541
00:45:36.830 --> 00:45:38.420
P32: the process done.

542
00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:44.724
P32: and then some more online application help through.

543
00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:49.789
P32: the information there numbers and so on.

544
00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:59.870
Moderator: Thank you for talking through that. Is there anything, or if anything, on this page, does it stand out to you as being

545
00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:03.290
Moderator: really helpful or really confusing?

546
00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:07.749
P32: No, it's alright, I understand it. It's pretty. It's pretty clear.

547
00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:10.450
Moderator: Okay.

548
00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:14.780
P32: At least I would be able to understand it very well.

549
00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:17.679
Moderator: Okay. Great.

550
00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:22.660
P32: What could what could happen if it gets denied? I have to pop. I have to follow the process.

551
00:46:27.170 --> 00:46:30.359
P32: We are getting a reconsideration.

552
00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:33.730
Moderator: Okay.

553
00:46:34.830 --> 00:46:42.009
Moderator: great. Thank you for that feedback. Okay. So I'm going to stop screen sharing. Now, just have a couple wrap up questions today.

554
00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:47.969
Moderator: So what research would you do before completing a form like this on your own.

555
00:46:49.100 --> 00:47:02.269
P32: I would probably, to be honest, being the way I am, I would probably go in and ask it for the information at the business area at the Va. And asking them to see if they would be the ones for me to ask first.st

556
00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:03.140
Moderator: Okay.

557
00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:09.799
P32: And that probably, give me pamphlets, or whatever information they might have in regards to the subject.

558
00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:17.500
P32: Or if there's some kind of a booth there with the information. I'll pick up some stuff in regards to that.

559
00:47:18.450 --> 00:47:19.290
Moderator: Okay, great.

560
00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:26.229
Moderator: Would you prefer to have help completing this form from an accredited representative or someone else from the Va.

561
00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:30.810
P32: It is always welcome. In my case it would. It will be always welcome.

562
00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:32.520
P32: just in case, you know.

563
00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:34.129
P32: to be on the safe side.

564
00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:35.050
Moderator: Okay.

565
00:47:35.050 --> 00:47:39.729

566
00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:42.619
P32: rather a confident way of going and

567
00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:45.120
P32: feeling at ease

568
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:48.979
P32: that the application is going through the way it's supposed to.

569
00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:51.870
Moderator: Got it. Thank you for that feedback.

570
00:47:52.430 --> 00:48:00.340
Moderator: I'm curious. What are your thoughts on the amount of information provided in this form? Did you think it was too much, too little, or just enough.

571
00:48:00.665 --> 00:48:00.990
P32: One

572
00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:04.080
P32: not really just enough, just enough would be fine

573
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:05.470
P32: on that part.

574
00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:08.139
P32: I didn't feel it didn't overwhelm you.

575
00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:09.350
Moderator: Okay.

576
00:48:09.930 --> 00:48:10.960
Moderator: is there any additional.

577
00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:11.760
P32: I'm sorry.

578
00:48:12.310 --> 00:48:22.360
P32: Oh, sorry I wasn't feeling. I wasn't feeling like we were too picky. And so on, asking too many questions. It's just the necessary information

579
00:48:22.989 --> 00:48:26.280
P32: for the form, you know, being for that particular form

580
00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:27.860
P32: which is fine.

581
00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:30.510
Moderator: Okay.

582
00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:36.490
P32: I mean any doubt if somebody gives me gave me a hand. Of course it's highly appreciated.

583
