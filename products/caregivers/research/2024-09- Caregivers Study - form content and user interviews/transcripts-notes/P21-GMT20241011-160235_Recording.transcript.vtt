00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:08.610
Moderator: Okay, I have started recording. So I'd just like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

2
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.289
P21: Yes, that's fine.

3
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.699
Moderator: Okay? And are you comfortable? If we decided to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with our BA partners.

4
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.669
Moderator: if we were to remove any information that could be used to identify you.

5
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:21.820
P21: That's fine!

6
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:30.089
Moderator: Okay, thank you so much. So before we take a look at that form I was talking about, I just have some questions for you.

7
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:39.839
Moderator: Can you confirm? Or actually, I don't have this in my records? Have you ever applied for the program of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers?

8
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.590
P21: Comprehensive assistance. I'm not sure I don't think so.

9
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.999
Moderator: That's the stipend program where you would have.

10
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.230
P21: Looked into it. But yeah, I didn't qualify.

11
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:50.890
Moderator: Okay.

12
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.699
Moderator: So you've heard of that program. Correct?

13
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.690
P21: If it's if it's the one I'm thinking about. Yeah.

14
00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.969
Moderator: Okay, have you ever interacted with the Va for other family member benefits.

15
00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:11.099
P21: Not directly, but I did do some research to look into, maybe like educational assistance for my spouse.

16
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:12.170
Moderator: Okay.

17
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.099
Moderator: Could you explain to me in your own words what it means to have a caregiver.

18
00:01:19.886 --> 00:01:25.969
P21: It's someone at home who helps you deal with everyday tasks

19
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.010
P21: that you can't do on your on your own.

20
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.560
Moderator: Okay.

21
00:01:30.073 --> 00:01:36.969
Moderator: how would you want to learn more about caregiver programs and benefits for family members who may qualify.

22
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.479
P21: How would I like to learn, like what mode.

23
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.610
Moderator: What method.

24
00:01:44.903 --> 00:01:51.589
P21: honestly for me, it's usually just if there's like a web page on the Va. That's clear, and has very clear guidelines.

25
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.559
P21: maybe not too much

26
00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.150
P21: because some pages sometimes are just full of like

27
00:02:00.176 --> 00:02:09.100
P21: policy and qualifiers and all that. All that information, if it's just like very simple, straightforward. On on a page. With a clear

28
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:16.720
P21: access to an application form. I think that would be just the way that I usually would want to find information.

29
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:29.470
Moderator: Okay, thank you so much. If you were completing a form to apply for caregiver benefits like the one we're going to go through today. What information do you think that you would be looking for before completing the form.

30
00:02:30.758 --> 00:02:39.819
P21: I would want to know right away if I qualify for it or not. So if there's just a clear list of like, these are the things that you need to be in order to qualify for this

31
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.720
P21: that would be helpful. So I'll know whether to start the form or not.

32
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.410
Moderator: Okay, thank you. That's really helpful.

33
00:02:46.025 --> 00:02:52.410
Moderator: Okay, so I am. Gonna share a link to that form with you in the zoom chat.

34
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.099
Moderator: Let me know if you need any help finding it.

35
00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.310
Moderator: I have sent it.

36
00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.520
P21: Okay. So I opened it up.

37
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:14.270
Moderator: Okay. So now I want you to share your screen with me in zoom. Just that window that has the form open. Let me know if you need any help doing that.

38
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.750
P21: We

39
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:29.490
P21: screen?

40
00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:41.020
P21: Hmm.

41
00:03:41.403 --> 00:03:46.009
Moderator: Starting. Okay, perfect. So if you just open that form, that's perfect.

42
00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:54.670
Moderator: Alright. So I just want you to review this page and tell me your initial thoughts and expectations of this form before going forward and applying.

43
00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:07.329
P21: yeah, I mean, in in terms of style and content. It seems consistent with other pages on the Va.

44
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.939
P21: it's let's see.

45
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:25.090
P21: Yeah, I mean, I I like the outline format of the the steps, 1, 2, and

46
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.440
P21: 3.

47
00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.380
P21: It seems fairly

48
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.929
P21: clear and straightforward. And not packed with too much extra like jargon in other.

49
00:04:35.493 --> 00:04:38.476
P21: Pause your legal information, or anything like that.

50
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:41.410
Moderator: Okay.

51
00:04:43.758 --> 00:04:48.530
Moderator: Is anything on the page standing out to you as being confusing or particularly helpful?

52
00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:52.860
P21: Let's see.

53
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.049
Moderator: You can also like move my face if it's getting in the way.

54
00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.416
P21: Okay, yeah.

55
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:10.860
P21: I think

56
00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.260
P21: I think the formatting is good. Actually.

57
00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.959
P21: yeah. At 1st I thought, Is it is it odd to have the start your application at the very top. But

58
00:05:22.347 --> 00:05:33.999
P21: I think the reason for that I'm assuming is because some people probably already know the eligibility requirements and want to access the application right away. But if you don't know if you're eligible, I mean it's right below that that it says, check your eligibility. And so

59
00:05:34.565 --> 00:05:39.429
P21: so I think that's a good way to start the the page.

60
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:42.310
P21: yeah.

61
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:56.579
Moderator: Okay, if you were going to rate this page on a scale of one to 5, 1 being the worst and 5 being the best. How prepared and informed do you feel about the application you're about to begin? Based on this page's content.

62
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.983
P21: I would say, I mean, as soon as I check the eligibility I would, I would say, Yeah,

63
00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:04.250
P21: 5.

64
00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:07.140
Moderator: Okay.

65
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.580
Moderator: Why would you want to check the eligibility first? st

66
00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:22.710
P21: I guess I haven't seen that page yet. I don't know how complicated maybe that page is first, st but I I'm assuming. If it's should I click on that? Does that link work.

67
00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:24.620
Moderator: Yeah, you can if you would.

68
00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.750
Moderator: If you would do that if you were applying.

69
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:27.550
P21: Okay.

70
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:45.409
P21: okay, I mean, and this is, yeah, fairly consistent with what I've seen on other Nva pages.

71
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:53.049
P21: it seems it seems it seems pretty straightforward and clear.

72
00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.319
Moderator: You can go back to the other page when you're ready.

73
00:06:58.570 --> 00:06:59.260
P21: Okay.

74
00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.169
Moderator: Okay. So I want you to start the application as if you were applying.

75
00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:05.070
P21: Okay.

76
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:16.589
Moderator: And just a reminder that this is a testing site. So you don't have to worry about any of the information that you enter. Going anywhere you can use real or fake information, whatever is easier for you to fill out.

77
00:07:16.912 --> 00:07:20.449
Moderator: I'll give you a fake social security number when we get to that step.

78
00:07:20.937 --> 00:07:24.809
Moderator: Keep thinking aloud. I want to hear about any reactions that you're having.

79
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:27.980
P21: Okay. So

80
00:07:29.213 --> 00:07:33.949
P21: so far, it's pretty simple to fill out on my phone. Even, I don't have to go on.

81
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:36.859
P21: I feel like I have to use a computer.

82
00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.520
P21: okay, this is it, breath continue

83
00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.550
P21: oops

84
00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:57.980
P21: that got erased?

85
00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:06.275
P21: Oh, you know, noticing that the auto completes. Don't

86
00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.559
P21: work here, so I have to just type it in

87
00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:20.260
P21: alright. So you said fake social security number.

88
00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:22.649
Moderator: Yeah, you can put 3, 2, 1.

89
00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:26.369
Moderator: 5, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

90
00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:31.770
P21: Okay, so better

91
00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:34.159
P21: continue.

92
00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:40.590
P21: Okay?

93
00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:44.380
P21: And then address.

94
00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:49.939
P21: I could. So I'm wondering if the auto complete will work on this page

95
00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:58.460
P21: county. Okay.

96
00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:06.609
P21: if the autocomplete works. No.

97
00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:11.230
P21: So what I'll do is.

98
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:14.269
P21: do that press space?

99
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:27.299
P21: Okay, that works.

100
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:33.900
P21: okay? So that's better.

101
00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:36.330
P21: Phone number.

102
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:40.539
P21: I'm assuming that's not gonna work. So I'm just gonna

103
00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.730
P21: type something else in

104
00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:50.539
P21: enter his email address. That's looks like that's optional. So I'm not gonna fill that out. Now.

105
00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.430
P21: what Va. Medical Center Clinic

106
00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:00.940
P21: City State.

107
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:11.760
P21: Okay? So it actually includes the the outpatient clinics, too.

108
00:10:13.668 --> 00:10:16.560
P21: Wait. No, Phoenix va clinic.

109
00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:20.560
P21: So

110
00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:27.169
P21: I noticed that this I can load more facilities. I didn't notice that at first, st

111
00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:29.520
P21: so that's

112
00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:32.430
P21: mine

113
00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.040
P21: continue

114
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:39.300
P21: so I guess my 1st question there would be how it

115
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.790
P21: how it was determined which clinics to be

116
00:10:42.535 --> 00:10:53.019
P21: listed first.st So I don't know if that was by alphabetical or just by what's most biggest ones or the most popular, so it confused me a little bit at first, st because I was wondering why I didn't see my location.

117
00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:54.040
Moderator: Yeah.

118
00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:56.230
Moderator: And why'd you select the one that you did.

119
00:10:57.841 --> 00:11:00.390
P21: Cause. This is actually the main clinic that I go to.

120
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:06.719
P21: and I didn't see that person, so I was confused, and I thought, Oh, is it not listed? But then realized, I have to click, load more facilities.

121
00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:10.850
P21: And then that's when I saw realized, okay, so there's actually more

122
00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:12.480
P21: that could be listed.

123
00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:13.940
P21: Okay.

124
00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:15.150
P21: we see

125
00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:17.509
P21: cool. I'm sorry.

126
00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.480
Moderator: What do you think about this page? Here.

127
00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:20.929
P21: This one right here.

128
00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:25.019
P21: okay, so I'm confirming that.

129
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:31.440
P21: Yeah, that's that's good to like double check and make sure it's the right clinic

130
00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:34.060
P21: that I selected

131
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:37.799
P21: primary family caregiver, applicant information.

132
00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:42.640
Moderator: What does the term primary caregiver mean to you?

133
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:50.570
P21: Primary family caregiver applicant. So I guess that's you know, for people who might have multiple caregivers, or even multiple

134
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:57.590
P21: from family members that provide care for them. Who is the I guess the primary, the main one.

135
00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.300
P21: yeah.

136
00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:02.530
P21: it's easy. Yeah.

137
00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:03.980
P21: that's.

138
00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:06.720
Moderator: So you are adding a primary caregiver.

139
00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:09.200
P21: I'm sorry.

140
00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:11.650
Moderator: Let's go through as though you are. Gonna add a primary.

141
00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:12.450
P21: Oh, okay.

142
00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:13.110
Moderator: Application.

143
00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:16.950
P21: The application to our library. Would you like to populate?

144
00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:18.930
P21: So yes.

145
00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:36.900
P21: let's see.

146
00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.120
P21: it's required.

147
00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.260
P21: And

148
00:12:58.740 --> 00:12:59.500
P21: okay.

149
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:04.930
P21: so you should put, are you gonna provide a.

150
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:07.680
Moderator: Yeah, you can put 3, 2, 1.

151
00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:08.330
P21: Okay.

152
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:10.319
Moderator: 4, 5, 6,

153
00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:12.460
Moderator: 7, 8, 9,

154
00:13:15.131 --> 00:13:20.020
Moderator: or sorry. Do. 7, 8, 8. We have to just change one number from the other. Fake one.

155
00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:20.680
P21: Okay.

156
00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:22.845
P21: Alright.

157
00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:27.140
P21: Use the same address.

158
00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:44.540
Moderator: And if you were completing this form for real, would you want this caregiver to be with you in person to fill this out.

159
00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:57.379
P21: In my case I would say, no, I mean I I it's just basic identifying information contact information which I know. I know our social security number, and so

160
00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:04.010
P21: I would do that as long as of course, I would have a doctor in advance, and we decided that this is something that we wanted to do.

161
00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:06.080
Moderator: Okay, Gotcha.

162
00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:09.130
Moderator: what does a secondary caregiver mean to you?

163
00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:17.109
P21: so kind of like. Maybe the the next person who provide who provides the most care, I guess.

164
00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.739
P21: to the person I would have to know.

165
00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:25.480
P21: I at this point I would question like, Okay, so what? What kind of?

166
00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:28.059
P21: Because I thought this was benefits for

167
00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:33.400
P21: primarily, I guess me that for the primary caregiver, but I didn't know that there would be

168
00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:38.219
P21: any benefits that might be provided to a secondary one, so I would have to learn more about

169
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:45.790
P21: that. What what the qualification requirements are for that as well as like. If there are any benefits for secondary family, curricular.

170
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:46.820
Moderator: Okay.

171
00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:54.040
Moderator: would you expect the secondary role to differ at all in the application process from the primary caregiver.

172
00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.679
P21: you mean in terms of

173
00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:04.550
P21: if the application process is any different for the secondary versus the first, st

174
00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:13.689
P21: I part of me would think it might be different, because I I would imagine it would. I mean my initial thought would be you wouldn't receive the same exact same benefits and

175
00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.089
P21: And I also.

176
00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:18.240
P21: yeah.

177
00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:22.329
P21: But I guess I do see that it says families. This is also another family member.

178
00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:26.199
P21: So I guess I'm assuming it has to be another family member

179
00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:28.789
P21: acts as a second.

180
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:31.779
P21: Yeah, I guess my initial thought is, I don't think there are any.

181
00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:41.549
P21: There wouldn't have been any benefits for a secondary one, but I guess I'm surprised to find that there is one that it does say here, would you like to apply for benefits for a secondary family? Caregiver.

182
00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:43.370
Moderator: Okay.

183
00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:44.060
P21: Yeah.

184
00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:49.029
Moderator: So let's go through as though we are adding a secondary caregiver to the application.

185
00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:52.210
Moderator: Just continue, think aloud.

186
00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:56.390
P21: So far it looks

187
00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:58.280
P21: the same.

188
00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:01.700
P21: So I'm gonna

189
00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.580
P21: this out.

190
00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:06.820
P21: And then.

191
00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:20.090
P21: okay.

192
00:16:21.711 --> 00:16:24.519
P21: so I'll just do another made up one.

193
00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:25.310
Moderator: Yep.

194
00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:28.789
Moderator: 4, 5, 6, 7. Yep, that's correct.

195
00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.100
P21: Oh, let's go

196
00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:39.580
P21: and just make up something.

197
00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:41.090
Moderator: Yeah, that's fine.

198
00:16:45.422 --> 00:16:51.409
Moderator: If you had to get this information from this secondary caregiver, though, how would you coordinate that.

199
00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:53.992
P21: Yeah, I would have to just

200
00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.591
P21: If I didn't know it then.

201
00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:05.746
P21: I would have. I've just call him, and then talk to him on the phone, and then, I guess, just pause.

202
00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:08.019
P21: I would not expect the

203
00:17:08.599 --> 00:17:14.647
P21: the app, the application to reset or start over. I mean, it doesn't seem like it. It's been doing that

204
00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:18.494
P21: And so I'll just text or call them and

205
00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:20.730
P21: get that information.

206
00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:21.790
Moderator: Okay.

207
00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:23.440
Moderator: Thank you.

208
00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:29.040
P21: Oops. Did I do that wrong?

209
00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:33.120
P21: Oh, okay.

210
00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:48.710
P21: phone number email address. Looks like, that's optional.

211
00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:52.120
P21: My tech. Let me show you.

212
00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:58.539
P21: Okay. So there's now. So that's all complete. Looks like there's an option for an additional secondary family. Caregiver.

213
00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:03.949
P21: Do you want me to try that for another time, or should I just say no, for now.

214
00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:05.689
Moderator: You can say no.

215
00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:11.360
P21: Okay. So now I'm curious to see what the next step is next steps to review and sign the application.

216
00:18:12.035 --> 00:18:20.870
P21: To my initial thought right now is like, Wow, that's that's all I need to do. That sounds pretty simple, so far, at least for this part of the application process.

217
00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:23.750
P21: I'm better. I'm sorry for myself.

218
00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:29.559
P21: So this is looks like these kind of boxes are all the previous information that I

219
00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:34.449
P21: input and I can look and see, and I guess double check the information.

220
00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.320
P21: To make sure I put it in correctly.

221
00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:41.829
P21: So I see the primary and the se secondary in my information at top.

222
00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:45.060
P21: And so this is the signature page.

223
00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:50.939
Moderator: What would you do if you wanted to correct something that you entered by mistake?

224
00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:52.910
P21: Alright, that's a good question. So

225
00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:57.359
P21: let's say, if I were to go here. Yep, I see. So there are edit boxes, so I can.

226
00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:59.887
P21: You should test it out right now.

227
00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:02.509
P21: Okay, so let's do that. I will.

228
00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.630
P21: Okay, yeah. So it goes back to the

229
00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:16.660
P21: city page.

230
00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:18.900
P21: Hmm.

231
00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:21.580
Moderator: Is that what you expected.

232
00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:25.390
P21: No, no, that's not what I expected. I expected it to go back to

233
00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:30.039
P21: I guess the list of the different clinics

234
00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:33.320
P21: in the Phoenix area, but I see that it's taking me back to

235
00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:36.689
P21: the selecting a city

236
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.059
P21: which is not

237
00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:40.000
P21: totally illogical.

238
00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:47.410
P21: I think what would probably be most convenient, but maybe asking for a lot would be to see

239
00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:54.910
P21: the selection I had made, and then the list of other clinics within the Phoenix area, but also to have this city

240
00:19:55.360 --> 00:20:01.340
P21: field that I can punch in again. If by chance I had to select another city, which for me in my case would have been unlikely.

241
00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:07.558
P21: but at least now I know

242
00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:11.360
P21: that I can load more facilities.

243
00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:13.729
P21: I'm kind of curious how many more there are.

244
00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:18.690
P21: so there are quite a few, so I could kind of see why you don't load them all at once, because that can be kind of

245
00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:21.180
P21: of only, but it wouldn't be so.

246
00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:29.350
P21: I don't know how many clinics there might be in other areas. But, like, if it's just this number of clinics for my area. I wouldn't have minded just seeing them all at once.

247
00:20:30.096 --> 00:20:34.569
P21: Cause it, especially on the phone. It doesn't take much to scroll down through the whole list, and

248
00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:38.290
P21: and especially because my clinic happened to not show up on that 1st

249
00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:39.990
P21: list.

250
00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:41.110
Moderator: Okay.

251
00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:43.450
P21: Continue and see if where that takes me.

252
00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:48.499
P21: Okay, yeah. So it's the confirmation page again, continue.

253
00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:55.779
P21: Okay, that's good. So it takes me back to the final page, instead of having me

254
00:20:56.418 --> 00:20:57.729
P21: scroll through it again.

255
00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:01.419
Moderator: You can keep filling this page out.

256
00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:02.080
P21: Okay.

257
00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:14.830
P21: okay. So I said this, I certify this information is true. So reminds me that, okay, I should better really make sure that health information is correct.

258
00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:17.640
P21: and look through all of it and review it.

259
00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:26.039
P21: So I certify that either I'm a member or I'm not member.

260
00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:35.110
P21: I agree personally.

261
00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.493
P21: So it seems like it's kind of a

262
00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.999
P21: short summary of some of the requirements. Again, of

263
00:21:44.239 --> 00:21:46.099
P21: if applying for

264
00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:47.669
P21: the caregiver program.

265
00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:53.030
P21: And this is to affirm that I agree with all this

266
00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:54.330
P21: oops

267
00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:57.120
P21: fully required.

268
00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:01.059
P21: Oh, so this is for

269
00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:03.190
P21: the caregiver.

270
00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:06.170
P21: Oh, this is for the primary family caregivers fill out.

271
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:08.960
P21: okay, so

272
00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:15.819
P21: so this is now indicating to me that oh, the person, maybe I didn't read it earlier, but the person is supposed to be with me.

273
00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:19.429
P21: and they are to fill out their name.

274
00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:25.929
Moderator: Yeah, what would your comfort level be signing that information without all the people involved present.

275
00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:33.189
P21: I I wouldn't feel right about that. And that's just me. I I would imagine.

276
00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:42.089
P21: you know, and I don't know other people's situations. I mean, they're older and maybe someone's in around. But as long as they say, I mean, I could talk to them and say, Hey, are you okay with me filling this out for you.

277
00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:48.610
P21: But even in that case there's at risk that they wouldn't have like read through all this. But it seems like. There's little risk in that case, but in my case I would.

278
00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:50.497
P21: I would at least

279
00:22:51.690 --> 00:23:01.560
P21: I guess, give my wife a detailed information of everything that's stated here and then and then ask her, maybe, would you be okay, like, I'm just gonna sign your name. Okay? And then she'll just say, alright, that's fine.

280
00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:02.860
P21: Okay.

281
00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.410
P21: it's a secondary.

282
00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:07.420
P21: And this would be a little.

283
00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:13.789
P21: probably a little less comfortable for myself, and then maybe a secondary

284
00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:16.030
P21: caregiver. And this might be something that

285
00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:21.910
P21: My brother might want to look more into. Let's say, if you were to be a secondary one. But

286
00:23:22.269 --> 00:23:32.120
P21: in my case, my brother actually lives outside the country. And so I may just like, send him an email with some information, and then say, like, Yeah, are you cool with me

287
00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:37.539
P21: signing your name, and he'll probably say he's laid back out. He's like, yeah, whatever. And then

288
00:23:38.273 --> 00:23:40.490
P21: figure things out later. So.

289
00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:41.400
Moderator: Okay.

290
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:46.960
Moderator: Okay.

291
00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:48.170
P21: Should I submit it?

292
00:23:48.785 --> 00:23:51.389
Moderator: You won't be able to submit it. It will give you an error. So.

293
00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:52.390
P21: Alright!

294
00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:56.810
Moderator: I'm gonna share the final page that would come up if you did submit it.

295
00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:58.990
P21: Okay, should I stop sharing the screen? Then.

296
00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:01.420
Moderator: Think I can just take it away from you.

297
00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:03.550
Moderator: You see my screen.

298
00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:10.689
Moderator: You can zoom in a bit if needed, you know, it might look like.

299
00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:11.650
P21: There it is now.

300
00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:13.069
Moderator: Mobile. Do you see it?

301
00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:14.230
P21: Yes.

302
00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:16.800
Moderator: Can you read it? Okay.

303
00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:19.260
P21: Yes.

304
00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:26.450
Moderator: Okay, so just gonna scroll through this page a little bit. Tell me if I'm going too fast or too slow.

305
00:24:26.758 --> 00:24:33.749
Moderator: I just want you to describe to me in your own words what the page is telling you happened and what comes next in this process.

306
00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:34.829
Moderator: Zoom in a little bit.

307
00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:40.929
P21: So it says that the form has been completed so that there isn't more than I need to do for the time being.

308
00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:44.299
P21: Sounds like I'll be maybe contacted

309
00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:50.529
P21: a certain amount of time. Who submitted this shows who submitted the form confirmation number. I guess they can use for reference

310
00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:56.929
P21: when I submitted it. What I can expect. I think that's nice, that that's there. What to expect next.

311
00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:10.160
P21: you know I mean one of the things that I think people would often want to know, but I know that it's hard for the Va. To do this, and to confirm this is to know

312
00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:18.409
P21: how long it'll take for this to be processed, but but I know that things tend to be

313
00:25:20.193 --> 00:25:25.760
P21: inconsistent, I guess, with the Va. But at least it does say that I'll get a confirmation email in 24 h.

314
00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:34.230
P21: or I'll be contacted by phone. What to do if you have questions. Now, that's that's also nice to

315
00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:39.659
P21: have there. So maybe you can. If I want to follow up on my application and see where where it's going.

316
00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:43.169
P21: what status it is, what you could do with application design, and that's also

317
00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:55.749
P21: nice, though. But I I would. I would feel that I wouldn't focus as much on that, because I first, st I'm more like anticipating waiting for response first, st before even thinking about

318
00:25:56.153 --> 00:26:00.210
P21: what to do if it's denied. But I think other people might be interested in that information, too, and

319
00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:01.500
P21: take that down.

320
00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:07.250
P21: And then my question is, now at this point is like, if I wanted to get this contact information again. Maybe at a later time.

321
00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:13.160
P21: Would it be easy to find that contact information, whether if I had questions or if I got a denial

322
00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.936
P21: in case I didn't write down this information, so

323
00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:21.069
P21: My hope would be an assumption would be that it it would be easy to find if I just googled that

324
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:22.990
P21: and found that page.

325
00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:30.709
Moderator: Okay, yeah, that's really helpful. Thank you. Is there anything that you would wanna see here that you don't.

326
00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:44.300
P21: no, I would say that for most people I mean I can speak for myself, feeling I was just my. If this was something I wanted to do, my interest would be simply in.

327
00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:56.929
P21: like, okay, I finished the application. Now, I just don't need to think about it for a little bit once I see that, like everything submitted at the top. I don't think would be as concerned about anything else that I need. I'm just

328
00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:58.579
P21: glad that it's done, and

329
00:26:59.114 --> 00:27:05.740
P21: the main thing probably would be just focusing what to expect next. That'd probably be the most interest of me. But beyond that I probably wouldn't.

330
00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:07.669
P21: Be that

331
00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:09.889
P21: focus on anything else.

332
00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:17.789
Moderator: Okay, thank you so much for that feedback gonna stop sharing my screen. And I just have a couple of final questions for you.

333
00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:18.220
P21: Sure.

334
00:27:18.922 --> 00:27:25.140
Moderator: So now that you've seen the form, what research would you want to do before applying and completing a form like this?

335
00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:28.409
P21: What we Stra, I mean.

336
00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:46.620
P21: the main thing would be like, what's what are the eligibility? Requirements? What sort of compensation and benefits would be provided, and then also, like, is there like any documentation or information like documentation which I need? I might need to upload? Or

337
00:27:46.740 --> 00:28:01.340
P21: what kind of information I might need for myself, and also my my caregiver, like as they ended up finding it was. It's simpler than I thought it would be. It was just social security number and contact information were probably the big things. And so but yeah, I mean.

338
00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:05.079
P21: if I had gone into a blind. I mean, that would be the kind of stuff that I would have wanted to know.

339
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:06.250
Moderator: Okay.

340
00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:16.529
Moderator: would you prefer to have help completing this form with an accredited representative, or someone else from the Va. Like a Vso. And why or why not.

341
00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:25.599
P21: I would say no, that would seem more cumbersome, and I and I feel like I'm fairly confident about filling out these kind of things and maybe doing the research I needed.

342
00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:32.860
P21: yeah, I I wouldn't want to. I I don't think I would need the extra help.

343
00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:33.830
Moderator: Okay.

344
00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:41.140
Moderator: is there any additional information about who qualifies to be a primary or secondary caregiver that you would have liked to see.

345
00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:50.809
P21: I would say. I think maybe I I skimmed over too quickly. I didn't think I saw

346
00:28:52.190 --> 00:29:02.270
P21: remember all the information about who would qualify. But I just remember the format and the outline seemed fairly simple and straightforward, though at the time, so I think it.

347
00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:12.749
P21: I think it's info. It's important that it was the information was there, but it was also easy to read and look over fairly quickly, so I think it was. I think the formatting was was good.

348
00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:21.859
Moderator: Okay. What were your thoughts on the amount of information provided in the form? Did you think it was too much just enough or too little.

349
00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:24.659
P21: I think it was just enough.

350
00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:27.855
P21: Yeah, I think it's just enough cause the you get a

351
00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:40.020
P21: after a certain amount of extra information is provided there, there's just kind of like this reading fatigue. And also it just, I mean, I mean, especially for other people who maybe, who aren't as comfortable with using online forms.

352
00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:42.570
P21: it would just seem overwhelming and

353
00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:45.910
P21: discouraging. I think so. It seemed like it was Justin.

354
00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:48.129
Moderator: Okay, thank you.

355
00:29:48.421 --> 00:29:59.719
Moderator: That is all the questions that I had for you. So you wanna circle back and reconfirm, are you comfortable? If we were to share a video clip of this session with our Va partners removing any information that could be used to identify you.

356
00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:01.559
P21: Yes, I'm fine with that.

357
00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:05.529
Moderator: Is there any part of our discussion you wouldn't want shared in a video clip?

358
00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:08.030
P21: No, I think everything is fine.

359
00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:16.470
Moderator: Okay, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us. This feedback is really helpful, so we can can continue to make

360
00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:32.070
Moderator: changes to the site to make sure it's working well for veterans and caregivers. Lastly, Perigan will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other veterans. If you know anyone who may want to participate in research studies like this.

361
00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:34.509
P21: Okay. So I appreciate all your help. Thank you.

362
00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:38.450
Moderator: Thank you so much for your time. I hope you have a great rest of your day, and a good weekend.

363
00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:40.149
P21: Okay, you, too. Bye-bye.

364
00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:40.969
Moderator: Thank you.
