00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.700
Moderator: Okay. So I started recording. So I just wanna confirm, are you comfortable? If I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

2
00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:09.490
P18: Yep.

3
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:17.679
Moderator: And are you comfortable if we decided to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other Va partners removing any identifying information.

4
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.270
P18: Yep, that's fine.

5
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.757
Moderator: Okay, thank you so much. So before we take a look at that form together,

6
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:33.380
Moderator: just have a couple of questions about the caregiver program. So have you ever applied for the program of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers?

7
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.310
P18: Yep.

8
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.879
Moderator: You have.

9
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.110
Moderator: Are you enrolled in it?

10
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.190
P18: Got denied after 2 very

11
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.360
P18: long appeals about 3 years, long.

12
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.819
Moderator: Okay, I'm so sorry to hear that.

13
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.030
Moderator: And

14
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.510
Moderator: when was it that you 1st tried to apply.

15
00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:06.719
P18: 2020, maybe somewhere around 2020, somewhere in 2020 we just finally got the second

16
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.460
P18: appeal

17
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.999
P18: this past year, sometime, like sometime in 2024

18
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:24.430
P18: and it's just none of it makes sense like their reasonings and everything. So we have one last shot. I didn't wanna submit it right away.

19
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:26.320
P18: Because

20
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:35.050
P18: there was just nothing new to add to our case, because their reasonings they would just give us same reason.

21
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.190
P18: So we're just gonna wait a little longer.

22
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.129
P18: you know all the reasons that it said it. It

23
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.209
P18: just nothing made sense.

24
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.070
P18: My husband has been at home.

25
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.729
P18: I've been doing consecutive care for my husband for

26
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.760
P18: over 3 years now

27
00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.020
P18: straight.

28
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.530
P18: So a lot of their stuff just didn't make sense.

29
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.300
Moderator: Yeah, definitely.

30
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.409
Moderator: Have you talked to someone at the call center or at the Va facility in person?

31
00:02:07.136 --> 00:02:11.060
P18: Several times. And it was, I've talked to the

32
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.379
P18: like the caregiver, support.

33
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.409
P18: person, like that, we're associated to for our.

34
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:26.150
P18: I don't know what it's called region or district, and it was just kinda it was. It's out of their hands.

35
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:37.430
P18: Everything was sent over, and when you talk to anybody when you call it's it's out of their hands. It's it'll get to you when it gets to you like the decision.

36
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:45.630
P18: and you can't physically talk to anybody about the decision or the reasons or anything. It's

37
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.139
P18: everything has to be done in

38
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.139
P18: writing, and you only get 3 shots at it. So we've already been denied. 2.

39
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.309
P18: The second one took 2 years. The denial came back 2 years later.

40
00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:08.030
P18: So we're waiting that whole time. And there's no timeframe for that which we're told from the get go. It could take

41
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:14.789
P18: 10 years if they wanted it to. There's no timeframe. Granted. If you're finally approved. You'd get

42
00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.509
P18: back pay for all that time. But if you're not like we were.

43
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.090
P18: we're just sitting here stranded where we

44
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:29.159
P18: I can't work because of his situation. So we live off of his

45
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.750
P18: disability.

46
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.030
Moderator: Gotcha, that is so crazy. I'm really sorry to hear that

47
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.510
P18: The next step would be

48
00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.580
P18: going to Congress.

49
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.599
P18: I mean, which is what we've been told to do. But

50
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.969
P18: I have health issues. I can barely handle what I'm doing here.

51
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.870
P18: adding that on top of this is just not something I can deal with right now.

52
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.769
Moderator: That's crazy. I'm so.

53
00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:03.930
P18: Like. I need a secretary to do all that, and I can't afford one of can't afford one of those. So.

54
00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.970
Moderator: Yeah.

55
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.760
P18: There's a.

56
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.880
Moderator: Great I'm glad that we're getting your viewpoint so that we can, you know, report on it.

57
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.010
P18: I do?

58
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.510
Moderator: Just kind of escalate that. However, we can on our end.

59
00:04:18.224 --> 00:04:23.219
Moderator: Have you ever interacted with the Va. For family member benefits.

60
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:33.910
P18: for family member benefits like. For myself, I go through Champ Va, but I don't know that I've

61
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.400
P18: contacting anybody.

62
00:04:37.203 --> 00:04:41.869
P18: Cause that, too. Everything is through the mail, so I don't think I have.

63
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:48.020
P18: I do everything for Ty, so I mean I do all of Ty stuff my husband's stuff.

64
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.950
P18: He's a veteran.

65
00:04:52.225 --> 00:04:53.000
Moderator: A.

66
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:54.230
P18: What was that?

67
00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:55.929
Moderator: Are you enrolled in Champ? Va.

68
00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.280
P18: I am. Yes.

69
00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.830
Moderator: Okay.

70
00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.840
P18: Cause. He's a hundred percent.

71
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.660
Moderator: Gotcha

72
00:05:04.003 --> 00:05:09.330
Moderator: so could you tell me in your own words what it means to be a veteran caregiver?

73
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.290
P18: The hardest job of my life

74
00:05:16.287 --> 00:05:19.319
P18: from sunup to sundown.

75
00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.819
P18: every day is different.

76
00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.770
P18: which is hard

77
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.619
P18: because there's no routine.

78
00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.160
P18: I mean, I guess there is a routine of no routine.

79
00:05:37.487 --> 00:05:43.559
P18: A lot of mental health issues that I have now because of this.

80
00:05:44.662 --> 00:05:53.590
P18: Missing my old life missing our old life. Because I am not able to work anymore. I miss my job a lot.

81
00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:54.900
Moderator: Yeah.

82
00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:58.920
P18: So

83
00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.044
P18: yeah, I miss money.

84
00:06:02.489 --> 00:06:07.520
P18: People say it doesn't bring happiness, but it buys a lot of other stuff.

85
00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:18.249
P18: it's just it's a big change that a lot of people don't realize makes you very lonely.

86
00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.029
P18: especially in rural areas.

87
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.740
P18: Yeah, where we are, we

88
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.089
P18: luckily have

89
00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.010
P18: for other people. Ty. It doesn't

90
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:37.880
P18: work for, because it is Ptsd, but we luckily do have a Va clinic here in our

91
00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:40.859
P18: small town, and it's like 50,000 people.

92
00:06:43.840 --> 00:07:00.320
P18: Finally, we didn't have one for many years, so there's some sort of place for veterans. But there's nothing for families. I've asked numerous times. There's no support. All it is is to call in every month to

93
00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.580
P18: the 1 800 number.

94
00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.670
P18: Hmm!

95
00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.939
P18: Or it sends you to like our regional place, which is

96
00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.310
P18: Toma or Milwaukee for Wisconsin.

97
00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:13.689
P18: but there's no physical.

98
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:19.289
P18: There's no beans here for caregivers. There's nothing.

99
00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:30.289
Moderator: Gotcha. What's your preferred method to kind of learn about these potential Va benefits? Do you? Your information in person online, from friends.

100
00:07:31.178 --> 00:07:38.809
P18: I have nobody. I'm literally alone. I have nobody. So I get everything through email.

101
00:07:40.044 --> 00:07:43.989
P18: And whatever websites I might reach out to or find.

102
00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:45.030
Moderator: Okay.

103
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:45.980
P18: Okay.

104
00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:47.240
Moderator: Gotcha

105
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:56.199
Moderator: What information do you think that you'd need before completing a form, to sign up as a caregiver for your husband?

106
00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:00.140
P18: Information.

107
00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:03.869
P18: God! It was so long ago. Now what did I need?

108
00:08:05.846 --> 00:08:10.440
P18: All of his documentation, which for me

109
00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:16.640
P18: I was very Ocd. So I knew where all of it was beforehand. But for somebody who

110
00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:21.310
P18: might not know where their veteran stuff is.

111
00:08:22.268 --> 00:08:24.460
P18: You know, you need

112
00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.770
P18: either computer if you're not gonna do it through your

113
00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:31.790
P18: caregiver support person, you're

114
00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:34.687
P18: the representative person that you're given

115
00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:40.140
P18: If you don't have Va access like

116
00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:49.109
P18: we lived in Milwaukee. So we did. But if you're in a rural area, you don't. So you need Internet access. You need to be able to know how to use the computer.

117
00:08:49.570 --> 00:09:01.920
P18: And you need to know where to find all of the veterans. Documents needed like their dB, 2 and 4 and all their medical records.

118
00:09:02.553 --> 00:09:10.809
P18: And then all their healthcare medical records, if they don't use the Va. Like my husband, because the Va. Is a

119
00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:14.809
P18: Ptsd trigger for him, so he doesn't use the Va. At all.

120
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.570
P18: So everything we use is private.

121
00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:25.713
Moderator: Gotcha totally understandable. I hear that a lot. Just kind of people associating Va and the military together

122
00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.710
Moderator: that can be a blocker for sure.

123
00:09:29.238 --> 00:09:35.410
Moderator: Okay, so I'm gonna have you open the link to the form. I will put it in the zoom chat.

124
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:36.390
P18: Okay.

125
00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:44.040
Moderator: Do you see that.

126
00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:45.150
P18: If

127
00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:54.670
P18: okay, I can't see you now. Is that is that okay?

128
00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:58.159
Moderator: Yeah, it's okay. See you, either. But

129
00:09:58.652 --> 00:10:04.610
Moderator: it's probably because the zoom window isn't like open. You probably have that link open right.

130
00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:11.659
P18: Yeah, yeah, it's probably because of the tablet thing, which is why I was gonna switch over. But that's alright. We'll figure it out.

131
00:10:12.315 --> 00:10:18.189
Moderator: But I want you to share your screen with me in zoom. If you could go back to the window, the zoom window.

132
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:19.820
P18: Oops.

133
00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:27.990
P18: Zoom okay? And then tell me how to do that.

134
00:10:30.234 --> 00:10:37.370
Moderator: There should be a I'm not totally sure if you'll see this on your tablet, but there should be a a toolbar on the bottom

135
00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:39.484
Moderator: of the zoom window.

136
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:40.630
P18: Shared.

137
00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.550
Moderator: Yeah, share. Button.

138
00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:44.980
P18: Okay, share.

139
00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:49.230
P18: What is it want me to share

140
00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:54.150
P18: to do the share screen.

141
00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:55.620
Moderator: Yep.

142
00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:00.010
P18: Okay, it's got like 15 different things here. Okay.

143
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.891
P18: okay, what is it?

144
00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.000
P18: Do you still see me? Or do you see something else?

145
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:21.960
Moderator: I see you.

146
00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:22.920
P18: Okay.

147
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:28.869
P18: display for other apps. I don't know what this.

148
00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:34.570
P18: Let's try it.

149
00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.160
P18: And

150
00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:49.340
P18: okay.

151
00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:50.630
Moderator: Perfect.

152
00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.511
P18: So now what happened to my?

153
00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:55.810
P18: There we go.

154
00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.840
Moderator: Yeah, perfect. I can see the form now.

155
00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:01.510
P18: Awesome.

156
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:12.039
Moderator: Okay. So I just want you to review this 1st page here and tell me your initial thoughts and expectations of the form before going forward and applying.

157
00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:46.320
P18: oops.

158
00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:23.687
P18: This all sounds like it would work so well

159
00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:31.700
P18: having thoughts about going through all this. Yeah.

160
00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:35.150
P18: Might get you where it gets you.

161
00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:36.770
Moderator: Yeah.

162
00:13:51.255 --> 00:13:58.500
P18: I don't remember the timeframe where? Where? It says 15 min. I don't remember that part. But I guess we'll find out.

163
00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:01.430
P18: Okay.

164
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:03.460
Moderator: 15 min means.

165
00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:10.950
P18: Like that. I shouldn't have to spend more than 15 min on this on the application.

166
00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:12.260
Moderator: Okay.

167
00:14:12.712 --> 00:14:15.879
P18: And I I don't remember that I

168
00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:23.089
P18: only spent 15 min on it. To me it feels like longer. But this was also a long time ago, now that maybe

169
00:14:23.893 --> 00:14:27.130
P18: promo from all this it seemed like it was longer.

170
00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:28.240
Moderator: Yeah, okay.

171
00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.590
P18: so

172
00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:35.820
P18: to find out if you're eligible.

173
00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:42.472
P18: I mean, I can only go off of what I know now that

174
00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:47.849
P18: they denied him for that. I don't know if that's

175
00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:53.259
P18: truly accurate, or if that's what they're, you know, still using

176
00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:56.340
P18: compared to what they denied him for.

177
00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:59.679
P18: Okay, but everything else

178
00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:01.950
P18: I mean. Seems like it should be easy.

179
00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:06.609
P18: Seem. You know, there's a phone number like.

180
00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:09.440
P18: seems like you should be able to get a hold of somebody.

181
00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:23.729
P18: but that's just the support line that's not to get hold of anybody, because they don't know anything about the application, if you call them cause I've called them several times. They don't know anything they give you to another number and another number

182
00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:28.419
P18: unless if again, that has changed where they've

183
00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:29.810
P18: like.

184
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:38.139
P18: you know, funneled some stuff where they figured stuff out and found a number.

185
00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:47.270
P18: But when I called the support care line like it was just the caregiver support line was just to talk to somebody. It wasn't to

186
00:15:49.075 --> 00:15:49.970
P18: like

187
00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:52.120
P18: find anything out.

188
00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:56.639
P18: But that may have changed like I said it was a while ago.

189
00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:59.620
Moderator: Okay. But it was not helpful, and you probably.

190
00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.720
P18: That number.

191
00:16:02.216 --> 00:16:04.653
P18: I ended up having to call

192
00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.129
P18: the military one source

193
00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:14.940
P18: like I even got them involved to see if they could find somebody to.

194
00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:23.969
P18: you know, get someone else to help me. And they were ultimately given the same information that I was that there's no number.

195
00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:31.119
P18: It's just a sit and wait, and there's no like status check number where you can see

196
00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:35.859
P18: how long it's gonna take or where it is in line, or anything like that.

197
00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:37.570
Moderator: Okay.

198
00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:41.240
Moderator: with a Vso or other.

199
00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:48.440
P18: And I was gonna say, the Vso says they they're like out of that. They they don't do anything with it. At least the one that I worked with.

200
00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:50.829
P18: They were like, you know, we are

201
00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:59.719
P18: our county, and that's it. Anything else we send you to the the numbers that we've been given from the Va.

202
00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:04.229
P18: But it's not like they got involved like they didn't make any calls.

203
00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:05.250
Moderator: Okay.

204
00:17:06.152 --> 00:17:09.279
Moderator: but they helped you like apply. In the 1st place.

205
00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:14.268
P18: No, no, I I applied by myself. That's what I'm saying. I don't remember the timeframe.

206
00:17:14.619 --> 00:17:22.220
P18: To me it seemed like it was longer than 15, but again it was so long ago I just might not be remembering the time right.

207
00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:23.460
Moderator: Okay.

208
00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:26.290
P18: But I did all the application by myself.

209
00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:27.989
Moderator: Okay.

210
00:17:29.399 --> 00:17:40.179
Moderator: on a scale of one to 5 one being the worst and 5 being the best. How prepared and informed do you feel about the application based on this page's content, and why.

211
00:17:42.856 --> 00:17:52.609
P18: If this is truly all you need on the application, I'm just gonna go off like I'm starting fresh. I know nothing about the application. If this is truly everything you need for the application, this is it.

212
00:17:53.937 --> 00:17:56.450
P18: I would feel

213
00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:00.890
P18: prepared. What was your number? Again? 1 1.

214
00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:01.610
Moderator: 5.

215
00:18:02.946 --> 00:18:04.370
P18: One being what sorry?

216
00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:06.780
Moderator: One's the worst. Five's the best.

217
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:16.999
P18: I mean, I would say 5. It seems like it's pretty thorough like. Tells you what you need. I'd have my social or his social

218
00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:19.230
P18: date of birth number.

219
00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:21.760
P18: this healthcare provider.

220
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:30.730
P18: I mean, I have all the numbers there. I need.

221
00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:34.720
Moderator: Okay.

222
00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:37.980
P18: 15 min. Yeah, I mean, it seems like it would be easy.

223
00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:39.320
Moderator: Okay.

224
00:18:40.008 --> 00:18:44.469
Moderator: so now, I'd like you to start the form as if you're applying for the program.

225
00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:55.019
Moderator: And just a reminder. This is a testing site. So you don't have to worry about any information that you enter. Going anywhere.

226
00:18:55.515 --> 00:19:02.780
Moderator: You can use real or fake information. It doesn't matter. I'll give you a fake social security number when we get there.

227
00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:03.970
P18: Okay.

228
00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:08.970
Moderator: Just think aloud as you're going through the form. I want to hear about any reactions that you're having.

229
00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:10.980
P18: Sure.

230
00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:16.479

P18: I'll put this on there. I can't imagine.

234
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.059
P18: Many people have his 1st name, but

235
00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:38.330
P18: he doesn't have that.

236
00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:53.690
P18: Okay. Easy, Peasy.

237
00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:55.909
P18: Alright! What's that number?

238
00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:59.109

Moderator: Then you can continue.

P18: Louisiana.

244
00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:57.530
P18: you have a different number for this, or you just want me to use mine.

245
00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:00.669
Moderator: You can use a fake number or a real one, it doesn't matter.

246
00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:03.420
Moderator: Just has to be

247
00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:06.250
Moderator: right. It's

254
00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:06.480

00:26:26.829 --> 00:26:30.120
P18: all the power went down. And then the Internet went down.

271
00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:34.259
P18: Okay, I lost everything. I don't even know where I was at.

281
00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:22.461
Moderator: Not your fault at all. When that happens, we usually just hang on and assume that they're having technical difficulties.

282
00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:28.159
P18: Alright, so I'll come back to you guys.

283

P18: I'll just make this stuff short, like ABC stuff.

290
00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:55.729
Moderator: Yeah, that's fine.

291
00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:04.390
P18: Luckily I wasn't all the way to the last page.

292
00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:11.420
P18: Now, it's really gonna make it seem like it's

293
00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:16.570
P18: faster than 15 min. Alright! What was that number? Again.

294
00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:17.950
Moderator: 3, 2, 1.

295
00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:19.080
P18: Okay.

296
00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:21.969
Moderator: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

297
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:56.132
P18: I don't remember if we were in the middle of a topic point, or a question either.

298
00:28:56.710 --> 00:29:02.290
Moderator: That's okay. We'll pick up where we left off. It was like the the facility search you were doing.

299
00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:03.699
P18: Oh, yes.

300
00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:06.879
P18: God! That was so bizarre

301
00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:09.147
P18: right here. Yep.

302
00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:12.133
Moderator: Fast getting back there.

303
00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:17.389
P18: As I said, it's gonna take me quicker than 15 min now, so I don't have to really read anything.

304
00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:24.209
P18: So I would have picked the Milwaukee one. I'm just gonna pick the one where we are now, Oasa.

305
00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:25.430
Moderator: Okay.

306
00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:31.780
P18: But again, he wouldn't have used it because he doesn't use any. Va. We only use private healthcare.

307
00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:32.770
Moderator: Okay.

308
00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:50.249
P18: That's what I was saying. I don't know if you heard me. So when you call the Wasa, it sends you because we're linked to Toma. It's a it's a satellite, the Va. Because it the Wasa one, because it's so small. So when you call the Wasa, it sends you directly to Toma, and then you have to tell them you want to go to the Wasa.

309
00:29:50.400 --> 00:30:01.749
P18: and then, because they don't want everyone calling the Wasa, and it being a wrong, not like going to the wrong place. So you get directly sent to Toma, just to being sent back to the Wasa number. It's it's pretty bizarre.

310
00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:02.920
Moderator: Wow!

311
00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:04.500
P18: Alright!

312
00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:09.640
Moderator: Thank you. Just going back to that page real quickly. I wanted to get your thoughts about it

313
00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:13.640
Moderator: what do you think this page is telling you.

314
00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:16.829
P18: So. I guess.

315
00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:23.459
P18: depending on how involved the caregiver is, or where they are in their caregiver journey.

316
00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:29.150
P18: I guess, for me right now this makes a lot of sense, but in the beginning it wouldn't have

317
00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:32.450
P18: So now.

318
00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:37.269
P18: being in Milwaukee, Milwaukee is a

319
00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:50.200
P18: permanent sites. So in the State of Wisconsin. There's 3 permanent sites. There's Milwaukee, Madison, and Tomah. So any of the other smaller Va clinics are all satellite clinics.

320
00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:56.950
P18: So if you have any issues. Your smaller clinic is assigned to

321
00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.080
P18: a regional clinic. So our regional clinic is Toma.

322
00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:06.339
P18: In the beginning. I wouldn't have had it on that, because we were in Milwaukee.

323
00:31:06.933 --> 00:31:22.679
P18: Here I found all of that out being in Wausau area that we're I just assumed we'd still be located or connected to Milwaukee, because all of his were registered with Milwaukee. All of our stuff is with Milwaukee.

324
00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:39.120
P18: but the Wasa clinic is a satellite of the Toma, so we had to re-register. Nothing gets shared between the 3 clinics found that out. So we had to completely re-register as a new veteran with the Toma Clinic

325
00:31:40.133 --> 00:31:44.779
P18: coming from Milwaukee, which again seems bizarre

326
00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:50.580
P18: so we'd re-register with the Toma Clinic, and then he could

327
00:31:50.760 --> 00:32:00.139
P18: be registered. And then, as when you're registered with the toma. You're then registered with any of the smaller satellites, which is the Wasa. So

328
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:15.989
P18: now this makes complete sense to me, because your signed caregiver support facility is Toma that makes sense like I know I was saying like there's no caregiver support. All it says is, call this 1 800 for the monthly, and it sends you to Toma for me

329
00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:24.089
P18: right now. So. But if I was in my beginning caregiver journey, I would have no idea what this means I'd be like.

330
00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:30.770
P18: what do you mean? I'm assigned to tomatoma is 3 h away from here, so is Milwaukee. So

331
00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:36.671
P18: Maybe there could be some explanation. If people

332
00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:41.289
P18: I don't know where it would be, but maybe under

333
00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:45.780
P18: your assigned caregiver was support facility.

334
00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:49.769
P18: You can sign this in the application process.

335
00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:53.940
P18: but if you don't know what this means, click here.

336
00:32:54.491 --> 00:33:00.430
P18: cause! I would not have known what that meant in the very beginning. Now I do.

337
00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:03.200
Moderator: Good to know. Thank you for that.

338
00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.610
P18: Makes sense. Okay.

339
00:33:05.545 --> 00:33:12.930
Moderator: If you were gonna rate this just this facility selection part one to 5, 1 being the worst 5 being the best.

340
00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:16.419
Moderator: how would you rate the process of selecting a Va. Facility.

341
00:33:18.311 --> 00:33:21.569
P18: Selecting the Va. Facility, I would say

342
00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:24.540
P18: very easy. 5.

343
00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:35.479
P18: But now, knowing what I know very confusing one cause as a beginner, it'd be like, why am I being sent to Toma

344
00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:40.740
P18: when I'm right here in Wausau like? So I live in Schofield. It's literally

345
00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:45.830
P18: 5 min away from that Vasa Va clinic. We're just a suburb of Vasa.

346
00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:47.040
P18: So

347
00:33:47.724 --> 00:33:52.710
P18: it doesn't make sense, I guess, unless, if explained.

348
00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:54.810
Moderator: Okay.

349
00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:57.080
P18: In my head.

350
00:33:57.300 --> 00:33:57.840
Moderator: Okay. But.

351
00:33:57.850 --> 00:34:05.109
P18: Selection is, I mean, easy enough, because we have a clinic like I said. We have luckily have a clinic here, otherwise

352
00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:11.750
P18: we would have been one of those cities where you have to travel. You know how many miles to get to a clinic.

353
00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:14.879
Moderator: Okay, yeah, not ideal.

354
00:34:15.517 --> 00:34:16.860
Moderator: You can continue.

355
00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:17.520
P18: Okay.

356
00:34:19.870 --> 00:34:24.590
Moderator: So I'm curious what the term primary caregiver means to you.

357
00:34:26.683 --> 00:34:29.619
P18: Who's taking care of all the business in the household.

358
00:34:30.449 --> 00:34:31.189
Moderator: Okay?

359
00:34:32.964 --> 00:34:40.089
Moderator: So let's go through a scenario where you're adding yourself as the primary caregiver on this application, and just keep thinking aloud as you go.

360
00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:41.220
P18: Okay.

361
00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:44.700
P18: only be one

362
00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:47.720
P18: at any one time.

363
00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:51.669
P18: Should you like to apply for benefits? Yes.

364
00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:55.860
P18: which

365
00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:00.650
P18: I did all of this for myself.

366
00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:07.030
P18: cause at that time.

367
00:35:08.290 --> 00:35:21.220
P18: I think at the time I applied initially, when the Vso. Told me to apply, Thai was institutionalized. I believe so. I was doing everything already.

368
00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:22.320
Moderator: Okay.

369
00:35:26.305 --> 00:35:32.420
P18: But they wouldn't give me he was still deemed competent.

370
00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:36.200
P18: even though he was institutionalized. So

371
00:35:36.584 --> 00:35:41.150
P18: everything still had to like go through him. They wouldn't give me power of attorney.

372
00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:41.860
Moderator: Okay.

373
00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:44.329
P18: We had everything signed in case of anything like

374
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:46.109
P18: looked in his head.

375
00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:49.480
P18: But

376
00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:53.000
P18: like I could fill everything out, but everything still had to go through

377
00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:57.370
P18: relationship

378
00:35:58.500 --> 00:35:59.220
P18: oops.

379
00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:06.270
Moderator: So you fill this out online by yourself.

380
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:07.310
Moderator: Yep.

381
00:36:09.409 --> 00:36:15.399
Moderator: for this one, you can put a fake one, too. Let's just change one number from the other one, so we'll do 3, 2, 1.

382
00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:16.060
P18: You didn't.

383
00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:19.929
Moderator: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8.

384
00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:23.740
Moderator: Let you go.

385
00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:28.852
P18: Oh, yeah, alright

386
00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:30.980
P18: interesting!

387
00:36:34.484 --> 00:36:35.469
P18: Yes.

388
00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:47.579
P18: is the primary family address, same as the home address? Yes.

389
00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:55.430
P18: cool.

390
00:37:19.810 --> 00:37:23.250
Moderator: Pam. What does the term secondary caregiver mean to you?

391
00:37:25.506 --> 00:37:32.580
P18: I guess it would be the next in line. So if something happened to me, or if I weren't available to

392
00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:35.359
P18: be here for him full time. Oops

393
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:38.410
P18: like I am. Oh, the wrong button.

394
00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:43.680
P18: like I am! Who would be next in line to be there.

395
00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:45.320
Moderator: Okay.

396
00:37:45.490 --> 00:37:51.890
Moderator: how do you think that the secondary role differs in the application process and the benefits from the primary caregiver.

397
00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:59.329
P18: I guess I don't know who qualifies so

398
00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:06.820
P18: in my head because we have nobody. We we can't have kids, so it would be like asking a family member.

399
00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:11.180
P18: But I don't know. Like the qualifications who qualifies.

400
00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:23.730
P18: yeah. Backup support. Okay, can have one of the relationships.

401
00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:31.510
P18: Oh, friend or other relative. Okay? Cause I was thinking, my mom so it would be mother-in-law.

402
00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:38.169
P18: Okay, just wanna make sure it wasn't. It wouldn't be something like. She wouldn't even be able to

403
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:39.699
P18: be that person.

404
00:38:43.610 --> 00:38:53.399
P18: I didn't. I know I didn't do this at that time, because I was very alone in my journey, and nobody knew

405
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:57.139
P18: what was going on. And A lot of

406
00:38:57.570 --> 00:38:58.970
P18: my family

407
00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:01.550
P18: left me.

408
00:39:01.890 --> 00:39:16.709
P18: So I've now finally gained some relationships back. But so for me this was an automatic. No, I had nobody, nor would I let anybody take care of him, because everybody wanted me to leave him

409
00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:19.390
P18: when everything happened.

410
00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:20.445
Moderator: Alright

411
00:39:21.497 --> 00:39:27.309
P18: But if I were to now have, like my mom is back in my life.

412
00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:38.340
P18: I would hope that if you you know this was approved. She would get the benefits if I were not there. To be able to get them.

413
00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:41.070
Moderator: Gotcha. Okay.

414
00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:43.219
P18: Sounds like. That's what this says.

415
00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:47.839
Moderator: Is that they would get the benefits if you were an.

416
00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:55.990
P18: If I were not able to get them if something happened to me. But I was whatever in the hospital for a period of time I'm not able to take care of him.

417
00:39:56.403 --> 00:40:02.430
P18: She would be the next runner up, and I mean I wouldn't be getting those benefits, so I would hope she would.

418
00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:05.550
Moderator: Okay, thank you. That's helpful.

419
00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:06.370
Moderator: Is that.

420
00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:09.741
P18: I mean, I hope that's what this says. It's what it makes it sound like to me.

421
00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:15.799
Moderator: Yeah, well, I'm just curious what you think, because we want to approve the form. So people understand?

422
00:40:16.509 --> 00:40:20.789
Moderator: But you, let's just say no to this one and skip this step.

423
00:40:24.290 --> 00:40:36.499
Moderator: Okay? So if you were completing this form for real could you tell me how you'd go about coordinating, getting the information from everyone involved.

424
00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:40.620
Moderator: Were you able to just you had all of that information? I'm guessing.

425
00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:43.080
P18: Everything. Yeah, okay.

426
00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:49.340
P18: I knew

427
00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:53.340
P18: I

428
00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:56.430
P18: had to.

429
00:40:57.656 --> 00:40:58.273
P18: Click.

430
00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:05.370
P18: You guys are gonna like hearing this. But this is what I had to do, because this is what the Vso. Told me to do, because they wouldn't give me

431
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:06.850
P18: power of attorney.

432
00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:11.920
P18: and I was institutionalized. So I had to. I clicked number one

433
00:41:12.542 --> 00:41:17.059
P18: because I didn't have legal authority signing for him.

434
00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:19.850
P18: and the Vso. Told me to get it

435
00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:22.520
P18: on like on the

436
00:41:22.650 --> 00:41:26.170
P18: books like, get it done as soon as I could, because

437
00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:32.889
P18: the first, st whatever approval or denial, would come back within, I think it was 45, or 30 days.

438
00:41:33.090 --> 00:41:38.850
P18: and the second one was 45 days, or 45 days and 90 days, or something like that. So

439
00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:44.259
P18: That's what I had to do for my life at that time.

440
00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:46.789
P18: but as far as documentation

441
00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:49.569
P18: now.

442
00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:51.150
P18: I mean I

443
00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:55.570
P18: I do have

444
00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:57.910
P18: now. I have

445
00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:02.500
P18: the power of attorney, and I have everything here.

446
00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:04.029
Moderator: Okay.

447
00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:09.490
P18: I couldn't get. I I couldn't even get legal guardianship. It was absolute bullshit, like the

448
00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:21.800
P18: sorry the the county was just like we're putting them away. But we're not giving you anything. It was just absolute. Nothing made sense in my life absolute. Nothing made sense in my life.

449
00:42:22.665 --> 00:42:28.294
P18: In the Va. Couldn't help because they don't have any power over any of that

450
00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:39.489
Moderator: And it's totally okay. We kind of assume a lot of people are selecting that they're the veteran, and they're just the caregiver filling it out for them. That's you know. I think that's.

451
00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:43.330
P18: I'm sure, only I was just gonna say, I'm sure a lot of them do it, too.

452
00:42:44.899 --> 00:42:53.199
Moderator: So if you were filling out now, is it accurate to say that you'd probably say I'm the representative, and you'd upload a power of attorney.

453
00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:55.960
Moderator: Okay, gotcha

454
00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:59.210
Moderator: you can select that.

455
00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:02.209
Moderator: Just want to get your feedback on the next page.

456
00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:07.490
P18: Hi.

457
00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:24.750
P18: yeah.

458
00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:48.370
P18: that seems pretty easy.

459
00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:53.649
P18: power of attorney I'd have. I would just have to

460
00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:57.848
P18: scan it into a Pdf,

461
00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:04.489
P18: Luckily I know how to do. If people don't, I mean taking a picture of it.

462
00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:10.260
P18: would be easy to.

463
00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:12.170
Moderator: Okay.

464
00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:16.030
P18: Enter the entire document, or we can't. Yeah.

465
00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:18.370
P18: And then uploading it. Yeah.

466
00:44:19.710 --> 00:44:20.430
Moderator: Okay?

467
00:44:20.968 --> 00:44:25.279
Moderator: So if you uploaded that power attorney, what would you expect to happen next?

468
00:44:27.534 --> 00:44:35.429
P18: Click the upload, file, upload it, I would assume it would say, either like check mark or

469
00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:39.069
P18: files too full, or something to go back.

470
00:44:39.310 --> 00:44:40.730
P18: and then

471
00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:48.220
P18: I don't know if it says like a button to proceed, or if the continue button is just blue and able to continue.

472
00:44:49.810 --> 00:44:56.437
P18: and then I would think that would be the end of it.

473
00:45:00.310 --> 00:45:03.620
P18: minus, like your electronic signature. Maybe.

474
00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:05.040
Moderator: Okay.

475
00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:06.480
P18: Let'.

476
00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:13.359
Moderator: Let's just go back and say that you're the veteran signing for yourself so that we can bypass putting a file.

477
00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:16.710
Moderator: You can continue.

478
00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:20.439
P18: Oh, there we go! Review everything that makes sense.

479
00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:29.460
Moderator: And if you saw something that you entered by mistake, how would you go about correcting that.

480
00:45:30.071 --> 00:45:32.779
P18: Just select that edit button.

481
00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:42.579
P18: and I don't know if it would take you back to that very 1st initial screen, or if it would just let you edit it right here.

482
00:45:45.831 --> 00:45:48.300
P18: To be able to change it.

483
00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:52.730
Moderator: What would you? What would be your preference?

484
00:45:54.884 --> 00:46:01.649
P18: I mean just selecting it here. I just didn't know if it would take you back to like the very 1st screen. Then.

485
00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:05.560
P18: if you have to go through the whole thing again, can I select edit?

486
00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:26.460
P18: Okay, update. So I wasn't sure if it was, gonna take us back to like the very 1st page, where, like, we initially started, and then make you go through the whole thing again. That's what I was wondering. But okay, that's easy, peasy. Just

487
00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:27.740
P18: edit it

488
00:46:28.050 --> 00:46:29.220
P18: updated.

489
00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:33.040
P18: Make sure everything's good. Good, good.

490
00:46:43.130 --> 00:46:46.980
P18: same thing. You can change it if need be.

491
00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:55.749
P18: And then yeah, electronic signature.

492
00:46:57.330 --> 00:47:02.570
Moderator: And what's your comfort? Level filling out and signing this information without your husband present.

493
00:47:05.570 --> 00:47:10.680
P18: Right now. I guess anytime I'd be fine doing it because I do everything for him.

494
00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:11.900
Moderator: Okay.

495
00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:14.649
Moderator: so you're comfortable with that.

496
00:47:14.650 --> 00:47:18.079
P18: Oh, yeah, I mean, he doesn't. Yeah, he doesn't know

497
00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:20.140
P18: anything.

498
00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:21.960
P18: Meds, money.

499
00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:27.049
P18: really, where we are, what we do. He doesn't know anything so.

500
00:47:28.090 --> 00:47:28.780
Moderator: Okay.

501
00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:32.199
Moderator: Do you want me to.

502
00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:34.760
P18: Continue that part.

503
00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:39.840
Moderator: It is. Gonna ask you to do the fake name that you put in.

504
00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:43.729
P18: I was trying to remember like, what did I do? ABC,

505
00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:46.492
P18: ABC, ABC, okay.

506
00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:54.070
P18: if you

507
00:47:59.010 --> 00:47:59.870
P18: is there.

508
00:48:04.410 --> 00:48:06.480
P18: I am 18.

509
00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:11.299
P18: Make that one member of this family.

510
00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:56.879
P18: Oh, makes sense. Did I use my name? I can't remember now.

511
00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:58.550
P18: Yeah, okay.

512
00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:12.265
P18: Alright.

513
00:49:15.170 --> 00:49:15.615
Moderator: Okay.

514
00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:20.629
P18: And this is easy. Just M. 18 and family member.

515
00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:25.989
P18: I acknowledge payments contingent on eligibility.

516
00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:29.519
P18: I agree to actually take care of them to get the money.

517
00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:31.830
P18: not just leave them to die.

518
00:49:32.450 --> 00:49:35.599
P18: I'm not getting employed by the Va.

519
00:49:36.162 --> 00:49:40.480
P18: They can revoke it or discharge me at any time. All makes sense.

520
00:49:41.150 --> 00:49:41.850
Moderator: Okay.

521
00:49:43.548 --> 00:49:48.451
Moderator: so you can stop sharing, or I can just take it over.

522
00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:50.343
P18: He's gonna take it over.

523
00:49:50.640 --> 00:50:02.249
Moderator: Since this is a test site. It's not gonna let you actually submit the form. It will just give you an error. So I'm gonna put in. Oh, no, wait. I'm just gonna share the final screen

524
00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:04.950
Moderator: movement

525
00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:09.649
Moderator: to get your feedback on that.

526
00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:19.589
Moderator: Alright. Do you see it? Okay, do you.

527
00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:21.029
Moderator: At all.

528
00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:21.920
P18: Yep.

529
00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:23.440
Moderator: Okay.

530
00:50:23.570 --> 00:50:35.570
Moderator: So just take a look over this page and let me know what your thoughts are. Impressions are, and what you think is they're saying is gonna happen next.

531
00:50:41.421 --> 00:50:45.839
P18: We'll contact you to let you know what's next.

532
00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:48.399
P18: what to expect. Okay.

533
00:51:00.930 --> 00:51:04.610
P18: we'll receive an email

534
00:51:05.070 --> 00:51:07.750
P18: confirmation email. Okay.

535
00:51:09.630 --> 00:51:16.730
P18: yeah, I don't remember getting a confirmation email. But maybe that wasn't something years ago.

536
00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:20.439
P18: Okay, everything I remember getting was all by mail.

537
00:51:21.390 --> 00:51:22.300
P18: Oh.

538
00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:26.300
P18: what to do if you have questions now.

539
00:51:29.610 --> 00:51:33.969
P18: there wasn't a website, at least.

540
00:51:34.930 --> 00:51:50.092
P18: Contact your caregiver support team at your oh, at your nearest Va. Health facility. Well, we did that, and they said to call the number. I remember, Ida. She was just like I get these calls all day long. She's like I can't do anything for you. Call the number.

541
00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:52.570
P18: So call that number

542
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:55.040
P18: and

543
00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:57.869
P18: the number. I think.

544
00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:00.749
P18: if I remember right.

545
00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:04.440
P18: you put in the sosh.

546
00:52:04.890 --> 00:52:09.779
P18: and it would just tell you it was received, or it would tell you.

547
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.500
P18: Applications

548
00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:19.449
P18: submitted at this between this time were received, but haven't been reviewed yet, or something like that. I don't know if that's still the process.

549
00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:20.600
Moderator: Okay.

550
00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:24.140
P18: But you couldn't actually like

551
00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:28.770
P18: select a number to like, Hey, I wanna talk to somebody

552
00:52:31.690 --> 00:52:37.160
P18: And then if you call the caregiver support number. They just say, to call that number

553
00:52:40.410 --> 00:52:42.170
P18: So it was very

554
00:52:43.590 --> 00:52:49.590
P18: very frustrating, because, like, what do I do if I have questions about my application.

555
00:52:50.559 --> 00:52:57.579
P18: and if you're denied, you send the letter with your reason, you disagree, you appeal it, which you did

556
00:52:58.553 --> 00:53:02.340
P18: learn more about the appeals, found that out.

557
00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:12.100
P18: so then you're eligible for the program of General Caregiver support, which is like the monthly

558
00:53:12.890 --> 00:53:18.600
P18: you know I have. You haven't gotten to them for a while now. But you can go to like the monthly

559
00:53:19.110 --> 00:53:21.550
P18: telephone call in.

560
00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:26.945
P18: I don't even know if they still do them, because it's been so long call and support

561
00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:31.170
P18: support classes. I don't know what you want to call it.

562
00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:32.390
Moderator: Okay.

563
00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:38.760
P18: learn more

564
00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:41.520
P18: the caregiver support line.

565
00:53:42.220 --> 00:53:50.160
P18: which is that the same number? It is the same number. Okay, that's what I thought, yeah, it's the same number. So you don't need nobody knows anything.

566
00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:53.050
P18: Oh, wow!

567
00:53:53.250 --> 00:53:57.349
P18: Caregiver support team at your nearest. They just tell you to call the number.

568
00:53:59.290 --> 00:54:04.520
P18: And that directory. Yeah, like our person. She just said to call the number so.

569
00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:06.080
Moderator: Okay, that's really.

570
00:54:06.290 --> 00:54:16.669
P18: Anything's changed one. As far as like the phone number goes, everything looks to be the same as when I went through all of this.

571
00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:18.720
Moderator: Okay, thank you.

572
00:54:19.490 --> 00:54:23.080
Moderator: Back. Is there any information that you would like to see here that you don't.

573
00:54:30.830 --> 00:54:35.609
P18: Maybe some of the information to like the

574
00:54:37.930 --> 00:54:40.919
P18: and maybe it is now on the

575
00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:50.439
P18: learn more about the family, the decision reviews and appeals. Maybe it's on there now, but like the whole, the timeframe period thing.

576
00:54:52.490 --> 00:55:05.139
P18: I just kept calling and calling, and finally, I don't remember who I spoke with, but it was I finally got a hold of somebody that was like the 1st one they have to give you back in 30 days.

577
00:55:05.630 --> 00:55:12.429
P18: It was 30 days or 45 days, the second one they have to give you back within 45 to 90 days, or something like that.

578
00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:13.960
P18: And then.

579
00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:19.690
P18: after that, there's 0 timeframe. So just putting that on there.

580
00:55:20.282 --> 00:55:35.139
P18: would be huge because I cannot tell you how many phone calls and emails and complaints and everything I made and like. I said, I've reached out to military family one source because I didn't know what else to do, and they couldn't get me anything

581
00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:37.920
P18: and then we just

582
00:55:38.384 --> 00:55:44.589
P18: it was last December. It was 2 years. That second appeal took 2 years. I got it back.

583
00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:51.730
P18: and it was devastating when we got the denial, because we just

584
00:55:52.610 --> 00:55:59.209
P18: all those points where it says these are the eligibility. It was like we meet, we meet, we meet, and

585
00:55:59.490 --> 00:56:04.009
P18: they didn't agree with it. That was that was basically their

586
00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:07.739
P18: Their decision was.

587
00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:10.689
P18: they said he could go back to work

588
00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:11.775
P18: and

589
00:56:14.970 --> 00:56:18.690
P18: he, has not been able to do anything for himself.

590
00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:23.277
Moderator: But he has a hundred percent service connection.

591
00:56:23.900 --> 00:56:25.470
P18: A 100% mental.

592
00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:27.910
P18: total, and permanently disabled.

593
00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:29.480
P18: mentally disabled.

594
00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:30.850
Moderator: Okay.

595
00:56:30.850 --> 00:56:37.390
P18: But Yup, they said he can go back to work and he doesn't need, because it's 6 months consecutive care.

596
00:56:39.110 --> 00:56:41.639
P18: And I've been doing it now since

597
00:56:41.660 --> 00:56:44.400
P18: February, January of 2021,

598
00:56:44.620 --> 00:56:48.899
P18: 2021, yeah, I thought it was 2020, 21. I've been doing it.

599
00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:50.170
Moderator: Gotcha.

600
00:56:50.170 --> 00:56:50.755
P18: And

601
00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:55.214
P18: So that's why it was. We only have one shot left and

602
00:56:56.390 --> 00:57:03.310
P18: There was no why, we had no new information. We've given everything we've given, and if they just decide that

603
00:57:04.050 --> 00:57:10.170
P18: they don't agree with it. Well, then, what's to say? They're not gonna agree with our final.

604
00:57:10.550 --> 00:57:20.689
P18: If we resend everything, even though everything, says the psychiatrist psychologist, the institutions say he's not going anywhere. He can't do anything

605
00:57:21.066 --> 00:57:25.703
P18: if they don't agree with it. If that's gonna be their decision basis.

606
00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:28.305
P18: Why would I?

607
00:57:28.850 --> 00:57:29.900
P18: you know

608
00:57:30.651 --> 00:57:35.180
P18: send in that last appeal and lose our shot? I guess.

609
00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:36.180
Moderator: Yeah.

610
00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:39.829
P18: So that's our. That's our devastating truth.

611
00:57:41.020 --> 00:57:43.650
Moderator: Well, thank you so much for sharing your story. I know it's.

612
00:57:43.650 --> 00:57:44.300
P18: Yeah.

613
00:57:45.650 --> 00:58:00.459
Moderator: it is really insightful. And I'm gonna share your story with our the contacts that I have at the caregiver. Va, you know. Department but I won't, you know, share any personal information?

614
00:58:00.942 --> 00:58:07.670
Moderator: Just to see if I could find out like why, you know, I I my understanding. Was it a hundred percent service connected?

615
00:58:08.090 --> 00:58:10.869
Moderator: That would be issue? And so I I don't know. That's.

616
00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:15.290
P18: And that's what we were told from the very beginning. It was going to be a shoe in because he was a hundred percent

617
00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:17.529
P18: mental. It wasn't just like.

618
00:58:17.810 --> 00:58:18.660
Moderator: Yeah.

619
00:58:18.660 --> 00:58:25.706
P18: I mean, he has his physical stuff, too. But it wasn't just like because of physical stuff. It was. He's a hundred percent mentally

620
00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:27.713
P18: deficient. So.

621
00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:28.860
Moderator: Okay.

622
00:58:29.209 --> 00:58:32.001
P18: Yeah, they all put you in, and then

623
00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:34.710
P18: and then we have the denials.

624
00:58:35.170 --> 00:58:36.430
Moderator: I'm so sorry.

625
00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:41.880
Moderator: I just have, like a couple of final questions that we're done here.

626
00:58:42.235 --> 00:58:50.789
Moderator: So what were your thoughts on the amount of information that was provided in the form. Did you think it was too much too little, or just enough.

627
00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:53.740
P18: No, it seems fine.

628
00:58:53.920 --> 00:59:00.060
P18: I feel like I remember putting more. But again, this was so long ago now, and my mental state has gone down that

629
00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:05.270
P18: I feel like I remember having to put like his Dd. 2, 1, 4, and everything right away.

630
00:59:05.570 --> 00:59:06.090
Moderator: Yeah.

631
00:59:06.090 --> 00:59:07.729
P18: But maybe

632
00:59:08.190 --> 00:59:12.149
P18: maybe it was the next step. And I'm just not remembering right. So

633
00:59:12.250 --> 00:59:14.120
P18: I mean, that's

634
00:59:14.310 --> 00:59:16.060
P18: all the

635
00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:25.880
P18: I mean, if that's all they need off the you know, off the bat. That seems easy enough. Less is more for caregivers. I agree with that.

636
00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:34.810
Moderator: Okay. Is there any additional information about who qualifies to be a primary or secondary caregiver that you would have liked to see in this form.

637
00:59:36.976 --> 00:59:48.023
P18: No. Once I clicked on because I didn't know what the like. The secondary, when I questioned like my mom, I was like. But then it said, Friend, neighbor, other relative like, that's pretty much anybody.

638
00:59:48.930 --> 00:59:50.290
P18: Yeah. So

639
00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:52.880
P18: oh, I think that's self explanatory.

640
00:59:53.350 --> 00:59:54.070
Moderator: All right.

641
00:59:54.350 --> 01:00:06.700
Moderator: that's all the questions that I have for you. I just want to circle back and reconfirm. Are you comfortable? If we were to share a video clip of the session with our Va partners removing any identifying information.

642
01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:08.370
P18: Yeah, that's fine.

643
01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:12.309
Moderator: Is there any part of our discussion that you wouldn't want shared in a video clip.

644
01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:14.070
P18: No!

645
01:00:14.350 --> 01:00:16.198
P18: Shared my story. Enough.

646
01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:24.610
Moderator: Hey, Melanie? Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback. Improve this process for veterans and caregivers.

647
01:00:25.237 --> 01:00:40.939
Moderator: Lastly, Perigan. That's the company that sent you the invite for this session. They'll be sending you a thank you. Note in your email with a blurb that you could pass along to other veterans and caregivers. If you know anyone who might want to participate in research studies like this.

648
01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:43.100
Moderator: Okay.

649
01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:45.129
P18: Good. You guys have a good day.

650
01:00:45.410 --> 01:00:47.300
Moderator: You, too. Thank you so much.

651
01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:48.869
P18: Thanks so much. Bye, guys.
