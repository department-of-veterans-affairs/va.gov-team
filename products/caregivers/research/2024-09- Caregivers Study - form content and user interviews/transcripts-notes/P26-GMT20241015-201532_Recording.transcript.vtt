00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:10.569
Moderator: Okay. So the recording has started. So I just like to confirm, are you comfortable? If I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

2
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:11.580
P26: Yes.

3
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:20.230
Moderator: And are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion to share with other Va partners, and we'll remove any identifiable information.

4
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:21.730
P26: Yes.

5
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.509
Moderator: Okay?

6
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.740
Moderator: So before we look at that online form, I talked about, oh.

7
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.940
Moderator: one other observer in. And actually, we'll do that.

8
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.260
Moderator: Okay.

9
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.629
Moderator: Oh, additional. Is everyone doing a short intro before we

10
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.489
Moderator: actually start the interview? We just finished the introductions for everyone.

11
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.219
Moderator: Okay, maybe you shouldn't hear the audio. We'll just keep moving. If that's okay.

12
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:12.839
Moderator: So before we look at the program online, we have a couple warm up questions. Have you heard about the program of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers before.

13
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.720
P26: I sort of heard of it. Yeah.

14
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.460
P26: I don't know anything about it, but I've heard the term.

15
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.780
Moderator: Okay.

16
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:28.180
Moderator: So I guess, even though you haven't heard of it. Can you explain to me in your own words the best of what you know about it so far.

17
00:01:29.693 --> 00:01:30.336
P26: Well,

18
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.710
P26: when I had my transplant

19
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.690
P26: they called and asked me if I wanted to get on the program.

20
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.945
P26: and

21
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.190
P26: explained some of the stuff on it, and I was.

22
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.980
P26: I had a very bad

23
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.930
P26: hospital stay and everything. And I I really can't remember

24
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.230
P26: a whole lot. So I I never got asked me if I wanted to join.

25
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.290
P26: and I said, No, not at this time, and they called back

26
00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.150
P26: some others a while later.

27
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.989
P26: oh, maybe a year or so, and I said No, and

28
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.280
P26: but

29
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.450
P26: I don't know why or not.

30
00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:10.580
P26: because I'm getting

31
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.700
P26: I don't know.

32
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.200
P26: And also, after my transplant. I've lost a lot of my short term memory.

33
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.970
P26: so I'm good on my long term memory. My short term memory is not very good.

34
00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.610
Moderator: I'm sorry to hear that. Thank you for sharing.

35
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.540
Moderator: So have you ever interacted with the Va. For other family member benefits before.

36
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.710
P26: Like, what? What do you mean?

37
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.359
Moderator: Just any other benefits for family members, not you. Specifically.

38
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.909
P26: Yes, my my wife is my caregiver.

39
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.679
Moderator: Okay? Is she enrolled in the general caregiver program.

40
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.360
P26: Yes, yes.

41
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.950
Moderator: Okay.

42
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.459
P26: And they say, talk to her once a month or so, and if they've come by the house and everything to make sure everything's okay?

43
00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:57.405
P26: And

44
00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.309
P26: that's the only other thing

45
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.920
P26: family wise.

46
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.279
P26: that I can think of.

47
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.359
P26: All my kids are grown up, and you know, moved out.

48
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.730
Moderator: So, I guess. Can you explain to me in your own words what it means to have a caregiver.

49
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.330
P26: Oh, I I couldn't make it without her. She, you know.

50
00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.459
P26: make sure I do everything right.

51
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.789
P26: Reminds me of my stuff and helps me get dressed in the morning and

52
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.319
P26: stuff like that.

53
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.600
P26: And

54
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.839
P26: yeah, I want to. Also.

55
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.080
P26: I have.

56
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:42.219
P26: I have something I don't. I'm not sure what the Va. Was calling it. I went to a study there where you had to go in, and

57
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.830
P26: for 8Â h, and you had to eat meals and stuff like that, and they see how you digest it. And

58
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:53.040
P26: and most people digest their meals in that time span 80%. I was only doing 20%,

59
00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:54.390
P26: so

60
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.110
P26: that it's messed up my system and everything, and I have no appetite.

61
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.290
P26: So she sort of forces me to eat.

62
00:04:01.996 --> 00:04:05.799
P26: I have a she makes me a a fruit tray every morning

63
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.279
P26: and makes me eat some kind of dinner. Otherwise

64
00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.279
P26: I'm working with a dietician at

65
00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:17.869
P26: at the Va. And she has me on a drink that I have to take every day

66
00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.370
P26: because I I just I don't feel like eating anything at any time.

67
00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.590
P26: I have to force myself to eat.

68
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.630
P26: so she's taken care of that. So I've I've been able to.

69
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.339
P26: I was losing weight there for for a while, and she's she's got me back down to where I'm maintaining my weight.

70
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.880
P26: so yeah, I would have a hard time making it without.

71
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.539
P26: Well, she's my official caregiver. She's still my wife, I mean, you know

72
00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.869
P26: she was taking care of it before

73
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.750
P26: someone said you should apply for caregiver assistance, and we did.

74
00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:53.180
P26: And

75
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.929
P26: I'm sure glad we did, because

76
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.389
P26: it helps out a lot.

77
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.729
Moderator: I'm sorry to hear that. Thanks for telling that story.

78
00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:09.810
Moderator: If if you were completing a form like we're going to go through here today to apply for caregiver benefits.

79
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.799
Moderator: What information do you think you would need before starting the form.

80
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.810
P26: I don't understand what you're saying, because we've already filled out the form we've already been approved.

81
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.250
P26: What do you mean? They would just ask me what they have already asked me.

82
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.630
Moderator: Yeah, I guess. Kind of

83
00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:35.940
Moderator: hypothetically. Then, if you weren't enrolled yet and you were getting ready to what do you think you would need to kind of

84
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.009
Moderator: sit down and do that application.

85
00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:47.740
P26: Probably nothing, because everything about me, medical, wise, and everything else is online. And you guys can look at it anytime you want.

86
00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.259
P26: and all you have to do is go in there and look at my medical records, and

87
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.490
P26: you can tell that

88
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.840
P26: there's nothing else I need to tell you.

89
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.739
Moderator: Got it. Okay?

90
00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:09.539
Moderator: Well, thank you for sharing that background. And now we're going to change gears a bit. I'm going to share a link with you in chat. It's to our testing site.

91
00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.689
Moderator: So, as you mentioned, you don't have to worry about information going anywhere.

92
00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:15.940
Moderator: And where did my.

93
00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.459
P26: I don't care if it helps people and stuff like that. You can ask me anything you want.

94
00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.250
Moderator: Oh!

95
00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.420
P26: I've been dealing with this for 10 years. So I I,

96
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:26.640
P26: it's okay.

97
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.389
Moderator: Let me see. Okay, there we go.

98
00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.790
Moderator: Should see it in chat.

99
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:41.609
P26: Am I supposed to push at.

100
00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:51.310
Moderator: Yeah, if you could, please open that window and then kind of set up your screen, and when you're ready, screen, share this window, and if you need me to walk you through, how to do that, just let me know.

101
00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.210
P26: Alright. I pushed the thing.

102
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.840
Moderator: Okay? So it should open in your browser

103
00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.759
Moderator: kind of behind the zoom window.

104
00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:09.129
Moderator: Okay? And then can you go back into Zoom? And there should be a share screen option

105
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.540
Moderator: within the bottom of the Zoom menu.

106
00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:16.630
P26: Are you talking to me doing that on my phone or on the computer?

107
00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.259
Moderator: On your phone.

108
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.200
P26: Okay, so.

109
00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:27.130
Moderator: Are you on an iphone, or an android.

110
00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:28.360
P26: Android.

111
00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:29.380
Moderator: Okay.

112
00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.049
P26: So I'll go to. What.

113
00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:37.690
Moderator: Okay. So there should be a you should be able to tap your screen and then give permission. Zoom, permission

114
00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.600
Moderator: to share the window.

115
00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:44.350
P26: Okay.

116
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:46.590
P26: No women.

117
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.260
Moderator: The start. Now. Window! Show up.

118
00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:11.440
Moderator: Oh.

119
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:15.160
Moderator: -oh! It looks like he pushed the wrong button.

120
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:18.700
Notetaker (Angela): Hopefully. I'll come back.

121
00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:19.546
Moderator: One moment.

122
00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.010
Moderator: Well, he rejoins, in a minute

123
00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:32.639
Moderator: we'll give him a sec.

124
00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:08.900
Moderator: Do hope he noticed. He dropped.

125
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:13.516
Notetaker (Angela): Might take a bit.

126
00:09:18.312 --> 00:09:21.859
Notetaker (Angela): Well, I'll just reach out to Perigin so that they can

127
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:24.630
Notetaker (Angela): a column or ask.

128
00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:30.690
Moderator: See her typing. But yeah, hopefully they can reach or he'll join. We'll give it a couple of minutes and see.

129
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:31.760
Notetaker (Angela): Okay. Cool.

130
00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.879
Moderator: Okay. He's back in the waiting room.

131
00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.470
Notetaker (Angela): Yay!

132
00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.949
P26: I can't figure some of this stuff out.

133
00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:33.989
P26: and I need you to wash those garbage cans. Help me. Hello!

134
00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:35.210
P26: Can you see me.

135
00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.410
Moderator: I can't see you, but I hear you just fine.

136
00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:41.709
P26: Okay, I I got my son here now he's gonna help me.

137
00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:47.630
Moderator: Sounds great. I will put the link back in chat.

138
00:11:48.576 --> 00:11:49.230
P26: You're cool.

139
00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:51.440
P26: So now.

140
00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:59.000
Moderator: So there's a link in Zoom chat to a test site, and we're hoping you could open it up and share your screen in zoom with us.

141
00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.660
P26: Yeah, I'm doing it now, or he's doing it for me.

142
00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:11.000
Moderator: Okay, yeah, just let me know if you have any questions or need any help.

143
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:19.839
P26: Okay, I see it. What do you want? What do you want to know?

144
00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:25.630
Moderator: Once you have it open back in zoom there should be an option to share.

145
00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.940
Moderator: and then you can tap that screen

146
00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:33.740
Moderator: and just kind of share that zoom window just the window of the staging link. We sent the test site.

147
00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:49.029
P26: I. I have a message that says, apply for some kind of form

148
00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:50.380
P26: is that it.

149
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:56.070
Moderator: Yep, that's just a test site. It doesn't actually go anywhere, and that's what we're hoping to get feedback on. So. Yep.

150
00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:01.560
Moderator: But I don't see you sharing your screen yet.

151
00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:04.529
P26: Oh! Is it this button.

152
00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:07.502
Moderator: That's the video

153
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:13.490
Moderator: close to that. Should there should be a share button at the bottom. Sometimes it's like behind that. More.

154
00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:17.420
P26: Your camera.

155

Moderator: That's sharing the camera.

159
00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:24.142
P26: They go bad.

160
00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:28.020
Moderator: Is there like a share screen or share window.

P26: oops. I turned it off.

163

P26: Yeah, there's share screen.

164
00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:44.450
Moderator: Yeah, try that one and then see if it'll let you get to

165
00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:46.739
Moderator: the link in chat opened up.

166
00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:56.800
P26: There we go.

167
00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:58.280

P26: is it working.

174
00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:40.010
Moderator: I see the phone screen. But can you just open

175
00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:41.270
Moderator: just a little

176
00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:44.380
Moderator: website sent in chat? So we don't have anything else on there.

177
00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:45.980
P26: Sure

178
00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:49.720
P26: this one.

179
00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:53.539
P26: Oh, see how there's a green box! I think that means she sees what you see.

180
00:14:54.685 --> 00:14:55.190
Moderator: Exactly.

181
00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:57.629
P26: Alright!

182
00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:02.540
Moderator: Perfect. Yeah, that is what we needed help getting set up for. Thank you.

183
00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:04.760
P26: Now, what do you want me to do.

184
00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:13.509
Moderator: Now, if you could just kind of look through this page, and we just want to hear your feedback and thoughts as you're going through it.

185
00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:18.660
P26: Okay, so you want to start at the top and read.

186
00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:48.449
P26: yeah, I remember doing all this

187
00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:52.750
P26: cause. It wasn't that long ago. Really.

188
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.299
P26: yeah, this one

189
00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:23.694
P26: guys.

190
00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:30.529
Moderator: Yeah, does anything here stand out as being really confusing or really helpful to you?

191
00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:35.989
P26: No, I'm I'm reading through all of it, and it it all looks very self explanatory.

192
00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:39.099
P26: I mean, I understand everything here.

193
00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:42.450
P26: and I remember, when I applied for it.

194
00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:45.120
P26: that it was very easy.

195
00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:47.490
P26: and the actual via

196
00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:54.049
P26: the representative helped me did everything pretty much. I mean it was. It was very easy.

197
00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:58.639
P26: They pretty much just told me everything to do, and I did it.

198
00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:08.180
P26: Yeah, I I would. I have no problem following this, and when I did it. Originally I had no problem whatsoever.

199
00:17:09.619 --> 00:17:21.289
Moderator: Got it. Thank you for that feedback. So I guess, on a scale of one to 5 of one being very poorly and 5 being very well. How prepared and informed do you feel about the application based on this page's content?

200
00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:26.010
P26: I feel it's a 10.

201
00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:28.420
Moderator: Okay.

202
00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:32.229
P26: I had. I had no, no problem whatsoever. Filling it out

203
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:34.659
P26: are understanding it.

204
00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:41.989
P26: and when it got in there I I had absolutely no problem whatsoever. I was more than pleased, so I'll give it a 10.

205
00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:46.900
P26: I'll give it a 9. Nothing's perfect. I'll give it a 9.

206
00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:48.040
Moderator: Okay.

207
00:17:48.160 --> 00:18:02.140
Moderator: that works. Okay. Now, can you start the application as if you were applying? Just remember, this is our testing site. So the information won't be going anywhere. You won't actually be applying, but you can feel, fake, use, fake information wherever you feel comfortable.

208
00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:03.490
P26: Okay?

209
00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:25.509
P26: Or what am I supposed to be doing?

210
00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:29.970
Moderator: Go ahead and just start the application as if you were gonna apply for the program.

211
00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:32.880
P26: Yeah, I was waiting. Start your application.

212
00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:42.840
Moderator: Yeah. And just remember to think aloud as you're going through the form we just really want to hear about any reactions that you're having and what you're thinking.

P26: Can you?

225
00:20:02.862 --> 00:20:06.029
P26: Social security number just did that, too.

226
00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:17.749
P26: Put in my social security number

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:28.350
P26: Zip code.

230
00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:30.069

P26: and want my phone number.

234
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:55.109
P26: Put that in there.

235
00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:01.709
P26: Veterans. Alternate phone number. I don't have one. So

236
00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.790
P26: put the same one in

237
00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.799
P26: hit. Continue

238
00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:15.440
P26: what the Medical center or clinic. Does the veteran get or plan to get their health? A David at Tampa.

239
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:20.490
P26: at Tampa.

240
00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:25.570
Moderator: Yeah, it's here is this how you'd prefer to search for Va facilities.

241
00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:27.560
P26: What do you mean?

242
00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:29.849
Moderator: By typing in the city.

243
00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:35.330
P26: Oh, no, I go to. Well.

244
00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.949
P26: this game failure should put the name.

245
00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:41.200
P26: I just always say the Tampa, because there's only one in Tampa.

246
00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:49.370
P26: If somebody says where I go, I'm telling them, James Haley, unless you're a veteran, you don't know who James Haley is.

247
00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:53.110
P26: So I usually say, the Tampa. Va.

248
00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:57.069
P26: yeah, that's what I usually say.

249
00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:04.699
P26: Select the Medical center of class at James Haley, and it's it's not letting me go past that.

250
00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:07.039
P26: What should I put.

251
00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:13.969
Moderator: Yes, not quite doing what you'd expect it to, or kind of talk me through what you'd want to happen here.

252
00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:18.359
P26: Well, it says, selected the hospital. I'm putting James

253
00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:20.050
P26: Haley.

254
00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:23.650
P26: James Haley.

255
00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:30.909
P26: and it's not let me go anywhere. Maybe it's a junior or something.

256
00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:35.080
P26: Oh, my God! They made me put the junior in there.

257
00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:38.890
P26: Wait a minute. Now.

258
00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:41.340
P26: Okay, this is this is the

259
00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:46.009
P26: they got me all over the place here.

260
00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:47.360
P26: Okay.

261
00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:48.869
P26: it's not working.

262
00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:52.676
P26: If I put in Tampa, DAMP. A.

263
00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:04.249
P26: It just keeps going back to there and saying, require in red.

264
00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:05.409
P26: And

265
00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:09.809
P26: if Tampa's not enough information, what the hell do I gotta put there?

266
00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:15.490
P26: I know it's called James A. Haley.

267
00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:17.429
P26: Let me see if I can try that

268
00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:20.370
P26: KAME. S.

269
00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:21.990
P26: The a.

270
00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:26.780
P26: A.

271
00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:27.960
P26: Haley.

272
00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:34.290
P26: James A. Haley. I don't know.

273
00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:37.779
P26: He could come somewhere.

274
00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:40.940
P26: Spruce Street, in Parsons, West Virginia.

275
00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:45.649
P26: Franklin, Virginia, Petersburg, Virginia.

276
00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:49.520
P26: but not here.

277
00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:51.739
P26: I can't get past this.

278
00:23:57.190 --> 00:24:00.469
Moderator: Yeah. Try the city search again.

279
00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:05.509
Moderator: Are you hitting anything on your phone between typing or.

280
00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:07.649
P26: Any other keys happening.

281
00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:12.229
P26: I got Tampa printed in there, and I go down here and hit the the search thing.

282
00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:13.560
P26: You know. The little

283
00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:15.180
P26: magnifying glass.

284
00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:20.969
P26: And this is showing 1 5 of facilities for Tampa.

285
00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:27.389
P26: Oh, wait a minute. Hold on. Now that one show Roosby Downs. Okay, here's 1 shows up.

286
00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:30.150
P26: Okay, I got it.

287
00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:34.100
P26: Now, hit continue.

288
00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:41.179
Moderator: Curious. Was it clear if you wanted to change your facilities, how to kind of go through that? We don't actually have to go

289
00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:44.419
Moderator: kind of struggle through that. But I'm just curious what your thoughts were on that.

290
00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.450
P26: I didn't see where you could change it.

291
00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:52.749
P26: Confirm your healthcare facility. The veterans facility you selected.

292
00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:58.409
P26: This is the facility where you told us. The veteran receives or plans to receive treatment. Correct.

293
00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:02.189
P26: Bruce B. Downs Boulevard, that's that is the one

294
00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:05.049
P26: your assigned caregiver support facility

295
00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:10.650
P26: is, and they're given the address in here. It doesn't say anything where. If I want to change.

296
00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:15.979
P26: if they have trouble using this online application, it gives me a phone number.

297
00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:19.360
P26: You can call the Va Caregiver support line.

298
00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:22.240
P26: and it doesn't have anywhere here. I can change it.

299
00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.800
Moderator: And what are your thoughts on the

300
00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:31.719
Moderator: content? Information on this page? Is anything clear or confusing to you?

301
00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:35.440
P26: It was fine until you know, as long as they

302
00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:40.019
P26: it was fine. Once I got past typing in the Tampa thing I don't know why it didn't take.

303
00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:45.659
P26: I'm I must not have capitalized Tampa, or something I don't know, but it took 3 times to get

304
00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:51.609
P26: something in Florida that come up. It was coming up with stuff in in West Virginia.

305
00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:55.069
Moderator: Yeah, that was really unusual.

306
00:25:55.490 --> 00:26:06.700
Moderator: So I guess, based on that on a scale of one to 5, 1 being very poor and difficult, and 5 being very well, how would you rate the facility selection process of choosing a Va. Facility.

307
00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:08.490
P26: A 2.

308
00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:09.690
Moderator: Got it.

309
00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:14.690
Moderator: I already talked about a little bit. Why, but any other details you wanna

310
00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:16.719
Moderator: add about why, before continue.

311
00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:18.569
P26: I had to do it. 3 times

312
00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:20.560
P26: I put in 3 different

313
00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:25.380
P26: wait the the city I put in the name of the hospital.

314
00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:26.940
P26: and it didn't

315
00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:29.030
P26: give me a a

316
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:33.329
P26: address in Tampa until I did it the 3rd time.

317
00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:39.129
P26: so I don't know what messed up there. I don't know. I don't. I'm pretty sure I typed everything in there correctly.

318
00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:46.379
P26: and James A. Haley, unless I spelled James or A, or Haley wrong, which I'm pretty sure I didn't.

319
00:26:47.057 --> 00:26:49.799
P26: Give me stuff in West Virginia.

320
00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:52.649
P26: not Florida. I don't know why.

321
00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:55.420
P26: And then the 3rd time, when I put it in there.

322
00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:59.100
P26: it said, there's 5 places in the Tampa area.

323
00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:04.339
P26: So I guess it was giving clinics and everything, because there's really only one

324
00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:07.440
P26: hospital in Tampa in the Tampa area.

325
00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:11.930
P26: The other ones were clinics, but it took 3 times to get to that part.

326
00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:14.160
P26: So yeah, I only give that a 2.

327
00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:18.670
Moderator: Got it. That's really helpful feedback to see how you would use that.

328
00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.269
Moderator: and kind of proceed on with the form.

329
00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:27.190
P26: Now, I would think, using common sense, that all I need should need to do is type in Tampa.

330
00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:32.629
P26: I did that twice, and nothing. Tampa did not come up

331
00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:37.130
P26: only the 3rd time when I capitalized it.

332
00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:38.280
P26: Did it come up.

333
00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:48.600
Moderator: Definitely worked kind of why, we're glad we're testing it and getting some real input in it to see how it reacts.

334
00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:51.630
Moderator: Yeah.

335
00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:59.500
Moderator: anything else that you want to share. Before moving on from this page.

336
00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:05.279
P26: No, that that's pretty much everything else is okay. I mean, long as you get past that it was fine.

337
00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:12.159
P26: because the the address, everything that comes up after that is is exactly correct.

338
00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:19.839
P26: So no, I don't have any other comments on this, except for getting past that.

339
00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:21.220
P26: finding your

340
00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:24.260
P26: facility that's not working too good.

341
00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:24.860
Moderator: Yep.

342
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:29.900
Moderator: yeah. Let's continue on with the next. Go on to the next page and continue.

343
00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:34.349
Moderator: can you? Completing the form and just thinking aloud, like you've been doing. It's really great and helpful.

344
00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.150
P26: All right, continue.

345
00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:40.670
P26: Oh, it says here. Would you?

346
00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:45.320
P26: Would you like to apply for benefits for a primary family caregiver required?

347
00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:48.580
P26: Do I hit. Yes, I already have one.

348
00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:52.370
Moderator: Yeah, kind of hypothetically, if you weren't enrolled yet

349
00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:56.990
Moderator: filling this out. And kind of what would the primary caregiver mean to you?

350
00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:05.000
P26: It says, would you like to apply for benefits for a primary family caregiver required when I hit? Yes.

351
00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.350
P26: and that means to me that

352
00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:08.490
P26: that

353
00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:12.859
P26: I'm going to have someone to help me with my daily stuff.

354
00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:15.620
P26: and it's going to be my wife.

355
00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:18.439
P26: and you're going to compensate her for it.

356
00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:21.539
P26: and you're going to help her take care of me.

357
00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:23.956
P26: and you're going to

358
00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:33.350
P26: help her. Yeah, I just said that, help her take care of me. And they they call and everything they they really

359
00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.080
P26: are doing a real great job.

360
00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:39.620
P26: It's pretty much. And when it very 1st fills it out

361
00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:50.109
P26: I wasn't sure what to expect. I just I had someone tell me, said you should. I was in in one of the waiting rooms, which I spent a lot of time in.

362
00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:53.099
P26: and I heard some of the other veterans talking.

363
00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:57.110
P26: and one of them was mentioning the caregiver program.

364
00:29:57.490 --> 00:30:01.050
P26: and the one guy was telling this other guy

365
00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:08.359
P26: that well, I already I already get. I'm I'm fully a hundred percent disabled, and I already already get compensation.

366
00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:13.760
P26: And he said, No, no, this is this is plus that because you need extra care

367
00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:16.529
P26: and said you, you get it on top of that.

368
00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:18.140
P26: And

369
00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:23.770
P26: I heard them talking, and I said, Hey, where do you? Where do you go to apply for that? Because I I think I not might need that.

370
00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:35.310
P26: And he told me, and I I mentioned it to. I think it was my primary, and she told me to look it up and everything, and apply for it, and everything that you you certainly are eligible for it.

371
00:30:35.891 --> 00:30:37.998
P26: I was. I was sort of

372
00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:43.801
P26: not disappointed. But I I wish I would have known about it earlier.

373
00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:46.489
P26: that. I've been this way for, like

374
00:30:47.144 --> 00:30:52.969
P26: since 2010, and I sure could have used that extra help a lot sooner.

375
00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:55.350
P26: But

376
00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:58.290
P26: That that's how I got on it, and

377
00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:00.540
P26: I don't know what else you want.

378
00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:08.300
Moderator: Oh, well, that's very helpful. Thank you for talking through all that. Do you remember if you applied online or you said you were at a facility. So did you just do it in person. There.

379
00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:10.890
P26: I applied online.

380
00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:14.199
P26: And then somebody called me back

381
00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:16.480
P26: and then

382
00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:22.370
P26: went through stuff. There. I applied online. And then someone contacted me.

383
00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:23.490
Moderator: Got it.

384
00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:28.100
P26: And then went from there and then they had my wife do a test

385
00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:30.723
P26: to make sure she could take care of me, and

386
00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:34.749
P26: you don't know my wife. She's she knows more than most of my doctors know

387
00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:41.849
P26: as far as taking care of me. So she passed that with a hundred she didn't miss one question.

388
00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:48.120
P26: And then they said, Okay with. And they sent me a letter like a few weeks or so later

389
00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:52.339
P26: saying that you're going to get, you know. Were you going to be compensated this amount

390
00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:53.840
P26: and that

391
00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:56.535
P26: you would have a

392
00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:02.100
P26: a representative, and I don't remember what her name is. It's changed 3 times now.

393
00:32:03.152 --> 00:32:05.939
P26: You can look it up. It's in in the system there somewhere.

394
00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.330
P26: and she said that

395
00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:17.106
P26: you know you would be getting this, and we'll be contacting. You will come by your house every once in a while to check on. You. See, if you're all right, and they do, and and it's been cool.

396
00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:25.300
P26: and they offer stuff for her classes and stuff like that for her to take to help take care of me.

397
00:32:25.646 --> 00:32:27.863
P26: She hasn't had to take any of them, because

398
00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:33.489
P26: she's been doing it since 2010, and like I say, she knows more than most of the doctors do about me.

399
00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:38.229
P26: but it has been very, very helpful.

400
00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:41.529
P26: I just wish I would have known about it sooner.

401
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:45.270
Moderator: I'm glad to hear it's been helpful for you.

402
00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:54.040
Moderator: Okay, when you were completing the form online for real, was she with you to help you fill this out, or did you complete it on your own.

403
00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:55.200
P26: I did it on my own.

404
00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:59.050
P26: It was self explained. It was. It was a pretty easy form, very easy.

405
00:32:59.950 --> 00:33:00.510
Moderator: Okay.

406
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:01.330
Moderator: yeah, let's go.

407
00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:01.690
P26: Continue.

408
00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:06.539
P26: And then they sent back the test. And I get, you know. She took. She did the test.

409
00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:08.780
P26: and she did that online. And

410
00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:14.379
P26: that was self-explanatory. That was everything was easy about. It was very, very easy, very simple.

411
00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:16.260
Moderator: Great.

412
00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:24.660
P26: And the representatives at at the Caregiver place. They're very helpful. They're a little confused at first, st

413
00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:32.589
P26: and a little they seemed to me like. They were moving people around. And all this like, I said, 3 different people at one time.

414
00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:36.980
P26: but they seem to start getting more organized. If he has me.

415
00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:38.779
Moderator: Got it.

416
00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:41.269
P26: That's just my personal opinion.

417
00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:48.480
Moderator: Share away. Yeah, if you could continue on as if you're adding a family caregiver, and just continue to think aloud.

418
00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:56.189
P26: I have to deal with. I have to deal with you, meaning the Va. I also have to deal with Tampa, general.

419
00:33:56.320 --> 00:34:01.829
P26: They're the. They're the hospital and the and the transplant doctors who actually did my transplant.

420
00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:05.070
P26: So I'm considered their patient for life.

421
00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:11.980
P26: But I have all my care and everything taken care of at the Va. Because I don't have to pay anything.

422
00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:15.292
P26: and when I go to the the

423
00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:17.540
P26: Tampa general.

424
00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:23.039
P26: at 1st you got. The Va. Did not have the thing where they would pay for you to go somewhere else

425
00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:29.469
P26: back in 2010. They didn't have that, so I had to pay that out of my pocket, and I had to go there at least once a year

426
00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:31.339
P26: for them to check me out

427
00:34:32.071 --> 00:34:33.479
P26: because I'm their patient.

428
00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:36.920
P26: And so that came out of my pocket.

429
00:34:37.179 --> 00:34:40.549
P26: And then when you guys, you guys meaning the Va

430
00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:47.930
P26: when you came up with that program where you would pay for the the veteran to go somewhere else.

431
00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:56.424
P26: and the Va. Would pay for it. Well, heck! I signed up for that right away, and that was very, very confusing. By the way.

432
00:34:57.030 --> 00:35:01.009
P26: I finally fit, you know, through doing it for a couple of years. I figured it out.

433
00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:03.490
P26: You have to call in each one.

434
00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:07.210
P26: Each appointment

435
00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:14.060
P26: you have to. You have to call it into the caregivers, and then they give you a 1 year

436
00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:21.889
P26: approval. So anything for that one year you're approvable once that one year's up you gotta do it again.

437
00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:24.180
P26: Well, see, they didn't ever told me that.

438
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:29.139
P26: And I have to go there once a year. Every year. I have to see the cardiologist there.

439
00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:33.359
P26: and I have to see the the liver doctor there.

440
00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:41.369
P26: and that's 2 different visits, and that that was, you know, and I'm on a fixed budget. All I got is the income from my Va.

441
00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:43.640
P26: And so that I couldn't afford it. But

442
00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:45.799
P26: my, I don't mean to ramble on. But

443
00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:48.470
P26: my point is, it was very difficult

444
00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:55.050
P26: figuring that out, and now, once I figured it out every time I go to another doctor other than the Va.

445
00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:58.740
P26: I have to call the caregivers to

446
00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:07.330
P26: get an approval, and they give me an approval. And that's good for one year. Now that I know that that's okay. So I gotta call every year. I don't know why they just can't.

447
00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:13.620
P26: since this is for life, I mean, the transplant lasts for life. I don't know why I have to do that every single year.

448
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:16.009
P26: but I know that's not your

449
00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.540
P26: your department, so

450
00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:21.130
P26: I don't know how I got off on that tandem. I'm sorry no.

451
00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:22.019
Moderator: No worries.

452
00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:26.399
Moderator: Thank you for sharing all the details and stories. It really helps us understand more.

453
00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:29.199
Moderator: Kind of continuing.

454
00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:32.579
P26: And and as far as a caregiver, this is where my wife helps me

455
00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:34.569
P26: keep the 2 of them separate.

456
00:36:34.990 --> 00:36:40.739
P26: And because, like I say my short, I have to write everything down my short term memory. Since my

457
00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:42.620
P26: since my transplant

458
00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:46.929
P26: I went. I was a pretty healthy person, at least I thought I was

459
00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:56.820
P26: until a transplant, and then my memory went. I lost my, I lost hair, I lost, I lost, I became a diabetic. I

460
00:36:56.890 --> 00:36:58.900
P26: I I got I got a

461
00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:04.190
P26: a panic attacks. Now I got all kinds of stuff from from this, and

462
00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:07.259
P26: she helps me so much through all this stuff and

463
00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:09.940
P26: and now that she's

464
00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:14.370
P26: she's she's getting help from from the Va.

465
00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:18.779
P26: That makes me feel a lot a lot lot better.

466
00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:22.470
Moderator: Yeah, sounds really rough. Well, let's.

467
00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:27.159
P26: It's it's not easy. I every every day I get up I feel like throwing up every single day.

468
00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:31.439
P26: and it's just it's and I got to live that way to rest of my life

469
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:42.929
P26: because I've I've you can look up on my my medical records. There, I've gone in. It's been 3 or 4 years I've been working on this, and they had can't come up with what spot? What

470
00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:46.850
P26: problem is they? Just. It's got to have something to do with your transplant.

471
00:37:48.052 --> 00:37:53.210
P26: So sometimes I throw up every morning, sometimes I don't, but the feeling is always there.

472
00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:55.719
P26: and she helps me through that too.

473
00:37:57.290 --> 00:37:59.449
Moderator: Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that that's

474
00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:03.820
Moderator: continue on and adding her to the caregiver form, sounds like she's

475
00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:05.730
Moderator: really helpful for you.

476
00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:08.139
Moderator: So if you can continue on

477
00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:13.249
Moderator: you said you'd normally she would be here, and she would fill out her own information when you did this for real.

478
00:38:13.850 --> 00:38:14.400
P26: Damn.

479
00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:15.430
P26: Yeah.

480
00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:18.459
P26: She goes with me on my appointments

481
00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:19.923
P26: and stuff

482
00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:24.192
P26: and make sure I get to all my appointments and

483
00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:29.340
Moderator: Yeah.

484
00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:34.800
P26: I don't. I don't know what else to say. She's she's a clear, a hundred percent caregiver. I'll tell you that.

485
00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:36.300
Moderator: Yeah, well.

486
00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:37.460
P26: She's a good thing.

487
00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:38.700
Moderator: Online form.

488
00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:40.919
P26: He should get paid more.

489
00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:45.689
P26: But we're very happy for what we're getting, but don't get me wrong.

490
00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:54.949
Moderator: Yeah, can you can click that, continue button. And there should be another screen that pops up about the primary caregiver.

P26: Primary family. Caregiver's 1st name required Janine.

500
00:39:35.130 --> 00:39:37.020
P26: I don't see why. Oh, spouse!

501
00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:39.249
P26: He's that, too. Spouse.

502
00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:44.820
P26: Okay, all that's filled out. I'll hit continue, cause that's

503
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:48.520
P26: all self explanatory. I don't think they did anything on that one.

504
00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:49.630
P26: Okay.

505
00:39:50.718 --> 00:39:58.790
P26: apply for the program of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers. Okay, primary caregivers, identification information.

506
00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:00.890
Moderator: Like.

507
00:40:00.890 --> 00:40:01.349
P26: We're trying to.

508
00:40:01.350 --> 00:40:03.660
Moderator: With a fake social if you're not comfortable.

509
00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:06.950
P26: And I've already given you all this stuff already.

510
00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:11.120
P26: Let me do it again. 2, 6, 2

511
00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:13.620
P26: on our

P26: Social Security Number tax identification number.

515
00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:33.290
P26: And I put, I put my social security number and it said, I'm sorry you've already put this number in before.

516
00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:36.910
P26: Well, hell! They're asking me for my social security number.

517
00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:44.679
P26: What do you or my identification tax identification? I don't have a tax identification number. I don't think many people do.

518
00:40:45.650 --> 00:40:48.909
P26: I put my social security number and it says you've already entered this

519
00:40:50.890 --> 00:40:52.230
P26: for what the hell do they want.

520
00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:55.819
P26: I'll do it again.

521
00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:59.500
P26: 2, 6, 2 oops.

522

P26: 2, 6, 2,

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:04.220

P26: We're sorry you're you've already entered this number elsewhere. Please check your data and try again.

525
00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:23.540
P26: That's that's super confusing.

526
00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:30.469
P26: They're asking me for my social security number. And then when I put it in there, they say we're sorry you've already entered this number.

527
00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:33.369
P26: So you tell me what's the problem? There.

528
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.160
Moderator: Can you scroll up a bit? I guess we were entering.

529
00:41:40.450 --> 00:41:43.130
Moderator: Is there anything else on the page? That kind of help could

530
00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:44.530
Moderator: clear that up.

531
00:41:44.890 --> 00:41:49.410
P26: Says, apply for the program of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers.

536
00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:17.930
P26: I guess I should have read that.

537
00:42:18.810 --> 00:42:20.359
P26: He didn't tell me to read that.

538
00:42:21.970 --> 00:42:25.426
P26: Okay, hold on. Let me see. Here she is,

539
00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:28.260
P26: 2, 6, 1.

540
00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:32.559
P26: That's my fault. I should have read the instructions.

541
00:42:33.330 --> 00:42:34.300
P26: 8.

542
00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:35.980
P26: Then.

543
00:42:40.690 --> 00:42:42.630
P26: Okay, continue all right.

544
00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:48.149
P26: And then it says, here, primary family caregiver's home address

545
00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:53.490
P26: is the same, and I'm going to use the same address. Hit that little box that says the same.

546
00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:58.609
P26: going down, making sure it is the same, and it is

547
00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:04.949
P26: is the primary family caregivers mailing address the same as their home address. Yes.

548
00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:06.040
P26: I'll hit that one.

549
00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:08.089
P26: and I'm going to hit continue.

550
00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:11.211
P26: and it goes down to

551
00:43:14.410 --> 00:43:18.130
P26: contact information or phone number.

552
00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:20.309
P26: which is the same.

553
00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:22.430
P26: Oh, no, that's not.

554
00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:25.629
P26: It's not her. So hold on and put her phone number in there.

555
00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:32.999
P26: Okay, that's her phone number.

556
00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:38.929
P26: And that would be the same.

557
00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:42.060
P26: Oh, alternate will be me. Okay.

558
00:43:42.610 --> 00:43:46.450
P26: primary caregiver's email address, which is correct.

559
00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:48.269
P26: It's already filled in

560
00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:50.090
P26: and I'm gonna hit. Continue

561
00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:53.819
P26: goes to the next 1. 3 or 5

562
00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:57.919
P26: secondary family caregivers, application information.

563
00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:03.630
Moderator: Yeah, what does a secondary caregiver mean to you? Or do you have one today?

564
00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:08.530
P26: I do not have an official one. No.

565
00:44:09.210 --> 00:44:10.910
P26: I have an unofficial one.

566
00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:12.420
P26: which would be my son.

567
00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:16.149
P26: but I do not have an official one. No.

568
00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:20.259
P26: and what that means is, in case

569
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:23.939
P26: my wife can't do it. I can add someone else that can do it.

570
00:44:25.810 --> 00:44:27.350
P26: and that would be my son.

571
00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:34.279
Moderator: Do you think there's any other ways? The secondary role differs in the application process and benefits.

572
00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:41.400
P26: I think it also means that if I don't have anybody that you would supply me one also.

573
00:44:42.490 --> 00:44:43.570
P26: Is that correct?

574
00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:46.800
Moderator: Is that what you would take from this page.

575
00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:47.950
P26: Yes.

576
00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:58.050
Moderator: Okay? Can you just continue the application as you would kind of if you'd apply with a secondary or not? And why or why not?

577
00:44:58.990 --> 00:45:03.799
P26: Okay, it says here you can use application to apply for benefits for a secondary family caregiver.

578
00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:07.579
P26: There can only be 2 secondary family givers at one time.

579
00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:12.890
P26: Would you like to apply for benefits for a secondary family? Give caregiver.

580
00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:20.219
P26: you know I don't even remember this part here. Tell you truth.

581
00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:21.135
P26: But

582
00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:29.939
P26: You mean benefits as far as he. He would get a compensation.

583
00:45:32.410 --> 00:45:36.640
Moderator: Yeah, is that not clear on this page? Or would you need more information here?

584
00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:40.869
P26: Would you like to apply for benefits for a secondary family? Caregiver

585
00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:43.040
P26: required?

586
00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:49.050
P26: I take that as he would get compensation, or help taking care of me.

587
00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:52.839
P26: and I probably thought, Well.

588
00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:54.389
P26: my wife's already

589
00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:56.000
P26: my

590
00:45:56.210 --> 00:45:57.650
P26: caregiver. I

591
00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:01.040
P26: wouldn't need a second one unless something happened to my wife.

592
00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:04.000
P26: So I that's why, I probably put no.

593
00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:05.870
P26: Okay.

594
00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:07.129
Moderator: Go ahead and put that.

595
00:46:07.610 --> 00:46:12.870
Moderator: I see we are at time. I just want to be respectful of your time. Can you stay a few minutes longer?

596
00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:20.769
P26: I have no problem with time. I'm just. I'm just. I just covered my grandkids, have been here for a week, got all the time in the world.

597
00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:24.239
P26: Yeah, I mean, where are you? What state are you in.

598
00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:25.803
Moderator: Washington State.

599
00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:29.119
P26: Whoa, you way far, man.

601
00:46:34.810 --> 00:46:36.110
Moderator: Oh, that's crazy!

602
00:46:36.110 --> 00:46:37.069
P26: So my my grand.

603
00:46:37.070 --> 00:46:38.339
Moderator: Glad you're safe.

604
00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:43.140
P26: My daughter. They were staying with us during it because they got slam bad in St. Petersburg.

605
00:46:44.190 --> 00:46:44.645
P26: So

P26: it. Now, if

607

P26: and he he takes me sometimes to appointments and and do stuff like that.

609
00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:57.390
P26: Had I read this carefully.

610
00:46:58.130 --> 00:46:59.740
P26: if I could have 2

611
00:47:00.210 --> 00:47:02.649
P26: I would put, I would probably say yes.

612
00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:08.019
P26: but I'm I'm not sure. What should I say? Yes or no?

613
00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:10.750
Moderator: Yeah, go ahead. And

614
00:47:12.110 --> 00:47:12.960
Moderator: really would.

615
00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:17.800
P26: You want me to make that decision, don't you? I'm gonna say yes, because he does help.

616
00:47:18.770 --> 00:47:19.690

P26: 1990.

633

P26: He's a male.

634
00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:30.609
P26: What is the secondary family caregivers relationship to the veteran?

P26: If the secondary family gives home address, he's the same.

645
00:49:09.250 --> 00:49:13.269
P26: Alright, I'm checking to make sure the address is correct. It is. It's in Pasco County

646
00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:18.499
P26: is the secondary family caregivers mailing address the same as their home address. Yes.

P26: let me look it up. Hold on.

652
00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:49.559
P26: I guess they want the Zip code. I mean the

653
00:49:51.150 --> 00:49:52.840
P26: 7, 2, 7,

655
00:49:57.770 --> 00:49:59.919
P26: i. 4, 4, 6.

656
00:50:03.350 --> 00:50:10.009
Moderator: You were completing this form for real. Seems like you wouldn't have any issue coordinating getting all of this information from everyone involved.

657
00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:14.239
P26: No, because I have it all written down here.

658
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:20.840
P26: I have a I have a little card file here, and I got everybody's information here. I've gone through this so many times.

659
00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:26.499
P26: and like I say, cause I can't remember. You know my short term memory. It's crappy, so I

660
00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:30.720
P26: make sure I write everything down, and if I don't write it down, it's on my phone.

661
00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:35.220
P26: So I I keep up on it. Pretty good.

662
00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:41.620
P26: Okay. You have 2 secondary family caregivers at one time. No, I don't know just no just one.

663
00:50:43.610 --> 00:50:47.490
P26: Now we'll guide you through the steps to review and sign this application.

664
00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:51.219
P26: First, st we need to know if the veteran will sign this application.

665
00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:54.040
P26: or if a representative will sign for them.

666
00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:55.400
P26: I will sign it.

667
00:50:55.560 --> 00:51:04.999
P26: A representative must have legal authority to make decision on behalf of the veteran, or they must have authority to fill or sign application on behalf of the veteran.

668
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:15.169
P26: If you saw, we don't need any more of that. We use the signature only to process your application. Signing for the veteran today doesn't take away their right to make decisions for their care.

669
00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:18.510
P26: I am the veteran, and signing for myself.

670
00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:20.440
P26: I will hit that

671
00:51:21.210 --> 00:51:22.639
P26: and hit, continue.

672
00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:29.300
P26: and it comes to 5 of 5 review application

673
00:51:29.970 --> 00:51:34.130
P26: as veteran information which I can look at which I am.

674
00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:35.950
P26: Yeah.

675
00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:38.220
Moderator: You saw something you entered by mistake.

676
00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:40.530
Moderator: Can you show me how you'd go about correcting that.

677
00:51:42.050 --> 00:51:43.279
P26: I hit Delete

678
00:51:44.510 --> 00:51:46.410
P26: or our backspace and

00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:49.140
P26: Okay.

681
00:51:51.490 --> 00:51:53.179
P26: I don't know what you mean by show. You.

682
00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:55.160
Moderator: Yeah.

683
00:51:55.470 --> 00:51:56.869
P26: Alright! Here, I'll show you right now.

684
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:57.420
Moderator: H.

685
00:51:58.150 --> 00:51:59.209
P26: Here. I'll show you

686
00:51:59.610 --> 00:52:00.930
P26: there. I I

P26: primary phone number. And I'm going to put it in again.

691
00:52:16.930 --> 00:52:18.409
P26: Okay, put it in again.

692
00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:29.050
P26: And secondary, it's the same always in secondary family caregivers. Email address. I forgot that, actually. And I had that right here.

693
00:52:29.090 --> 00:52:31.100
P26: Hold on, or or do I?

694
00:52:31.610 --> 00:52:33.010
P26: Yes, I do.

695
00:52:33.090 --> 00:52:34.340
P26: It's MB.

696
00:52:35.350 --> 00:52:36.050
P26: B.

697
00:52:36.890 --> 00:52:37.790
P26: Young.

698
00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:40.571
P26: Oh, there it is, right there in

P26: okay. And I put that in there. His email address. Now I'm gonna hit. Continue.

700
00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:51.209
P26: add another secondary information. No, I don't need another one.

701
00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:55.509
P26: and there's no one else. So

702
00:52:56.350 --> 00:52:59.629
P26: now we'll guide you through the step to review and sign this application.

703
00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:01.930
P26: First, st we need to know if the veteran all

704
00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:04.910
P26: I am the veteran, and I will be signing for myself.

705
00:53:05.250 --> 00:53:06.659
P26: I'll hit, continue.

706
00:53:07.610 --> 00:53:12.109
P26: and it takes me to 5 of 5 review application

707
00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:16.240

P26: What vehicle Medical Center clinic does the veteran plan to burst? Be downs. That's good.

714
00:53:37.220 --> 00:53:42.110
P26: Your assigned caregiver support facility is James A. Haley. That is true.

715
00:53:44.938 --> 00:53:52.980
P26: The veteran facilities. Bruce B. Down. Okay. Primary family caregiver application information.

P26: Yeah.

719
00:54:10.330 --> 00:54:12.760
P26: Scrolling down, checking everything. Make sure it's right.

720
00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:16.979
P26: Still scrolling.

721
00:54:18.190 --> 00:54:24.140
P26: Okay, everything there looks good now. Secondary family caregiver, application, information.

727
00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:46.760
P26: number looks. Good.

728
00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:48.380
P26: Email's good.

729
00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:51.280
P26: They want to apply for benefits for another. No.

730
00:54:51.910 --> 00:54:56.449
P26: okay, everything looks good. There. I'm going to the last one, which is application signature.

731
00:54:57.970 --> 00:55:03.470
P26: Select who will sign for the veteran. Today I'm the veteran and signing for myself.

732
00:55:06.110 --> 00:55:07.900
P26: Now, do you want me to actually sign it?

733
00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:15.349
Moderator: Yeah, continue scrolling down the page, and just let me know what your comfort level is with how that's presented to sign.

734
00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:19.359
P26: Okay, I've read and accepted private veteran's full name.

735
00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:25.290
P26: Harry

736
00:55:29.620 --> 00:55:30.390
P26: M.

737
00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:32.710
P26: Young.

738
00:55:35.810 --> 00:55:39.950
P26: uncertify that both information is correct and true. To the best of my knowledge.

739
00:55:40.090 --> 00:55:41.020
P26: I do.

740
00:55:41.550 --> 00:55:44.169
P26: Your signature must match previously entered. Name.

741
00:55:45.250 --> 00:55:47.239
P26: Well, maybe I'm supposed to sign up here.

742
00:55:51.570 --> 00:55:55.319
P26: Your signature was oh, I didn't put the M in there, I guess. Let me take the M out.

743
00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:02.610
P26: Okay, let's see if that works.

744
00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:18.189
Moderator: Would you be comfortable signing for the primary and secondary caregivers here, or would

745
00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:20.459
Moderator: they do that themselves?

746
00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:24.010
P26: Yeah, I'd be comfortable with that.

747
00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:26.649
P26: Wait a minute. It says I did that.

748
00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:35.740
Moderator: That's okay. We won't actually be submitting this application in test form, because we're in.

749
00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:36.060
P26: Awesome.

750
00:56:36.060 --> 00:56:38.580
Moderator: Site today so it won't work. So.

751
00:56:38.990 --> 00:56:44.209
P26: Okay, all right. Let me go down here. Primary family caregiver application full name.

752
00:56:44.450 --> 00:56:46.060
P26: That would be my wife.

753
00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:48.410
P26: Janine

754
00:56:49.950 --> 00:56:51.070
P26: Janine.

755
00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:56.210
P26: to Nina.

756
00:56:59.300 --> 00:57:00.220
P26: What's match?

757
00:57:20.670 --> 00:57:22.980
P26: I put her name in there, Janine Young.

758
00:57:24.250 --> 00:57:29.690
P26: It says that your signature must match previously entered. Name Janine MOM. Young.

759
00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:43.710
P26: and also it's it's a little harder for me to do on the phone than it is. I can do this much easier

760
00:57:43.790 --> 00:57:45.239
P26: on the computer.

761
00:57:45.790 --> 00:57:50.489
P26: My thing, I'm I'm a big guy. My fingers are just too small for my phone.

762
00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:54.730
Moderator: Yeah, so that'd be your preferred method. Is that what you did when you applied online, too?

763
00:57:54.730 --> 00:57:57.389
P26: Oh, yeah, yeah, I never do anything by the phone, never.

764
00:58:03.855 --> 00:58:04.710
P26: Okay.

765
00:58:06.350 --> 00:58:10.770
P26: All right, that worked. Okay. Secondary family caregiver application statement of truth.

766
00:58:11.110 --> 00:58:15.189
P26: I certified that I'm at least 18 years. Yeah, he's 18 over. Yeah.

767
00:58:16.090 --> 00:58:18.820
P26: And, Baba, you don't want me to read all this stuff, do you.

768
00:58:19.110 --> 00:58:20.810
Moderator: Nope, just do like you normally would.

769
00:58:21.860 --> 00:58:23.230
P26: And normally I would read it.

770
00:58:24.150 --> 00:58:40.480
P26: you know. I'll read it fast. Read the veterans full time, or we'll do soap. I'm done. I test that my application of participation is all true and correct veteran is involved in my payment, and I agree to perform personal care services at the center. Yes, yes, yes.

771
00:58:41.020 --> 00:58:52.710
P26: at any time my businesses may be revoked, or I may discharge by the Secretary of Veterans. I understand that participants does create an employment relationship between me and department of affairs.

772
00:58:55.020 --> 00:58:59.679
P26: Okay. Secondary family caregiver applications. Full name is Michael.

773
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:09.330
P26: I don't know if I put his last name middle initial in there or not. Try Michael Young.

774
00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:11.850
P26: oh, wait a minute

775
00:59:12.450 --> 00:59:13.550
P26: at the G.

776
00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:25.069
P26: Probably needs to be.

777
00:59:33.087 --> 00:59:35.649
P26: Hey, Michael, that should be right.

778
00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:50.739
Moderator: Yeah, is it confusing with what's going on with these signature fields?

779
00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:54.360
Moderator: Or is there anything that could help? How you would like them to work better.

780
00:59:55.130 --> 00:59:58.110
P26: Well, I put in his name Michael B. Young.

781
00:59:58.620 --> 00:59:59.929
P26: and it says

782
01:00:00.010 --> 01:00:05.230
P26: your signature must match now the other ones the other one. It's it had up there

783
01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:08.219
P26: when I didn't match it. It had the name written out

784
01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:19.000
P26: so I could just put in exactly what there. But the secondary one. There is no name at the top. Oh, there it is, Michael!

785
01:00:19.850 --> 01:00:21.989
P26: Oh, bear! Hold on!

786
01:00:22.090 --> 01:00:24.050
P26: They want me to spell out

787
01:00:25.450 --> 01:00:26.739
P26: the middle name.

788
01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:28.829
P26: you know. I think you could

789
01:00:29.350 --> 01:00:31.070
P26: do the middle name.

790
01:00:32.830 --> 01:00:36.149
P26: Alright, Michael P26. It's making me spell it out.

791
01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:39.959
P26: Okay? And that worked all right. That's a little confusing.

792
01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:44.380
P26: But it would. It did. It did work. But you gotta be.

793
01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:47.710
P26: You know exactly how it is on the other thing.

794
01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:51.670
P26: Okay, submit application. I did.

795
01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:56.229
Moderator: That one. It's a testing site. It won't go anywhere. But I'm going to

796
01:00:56.290 --> 01:01:00.310
Moderator: screen, share and take over and share my screen

797
01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:07.120
Moderator: because we do want to get a little bit of feedback from you on just this last Confirmation page. If you were applying for real.

798
01:01:07.390 --> 01:01:10.919
Moderator: But we're in our test site, so it won't actually go through.

799
01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:12.250
P26: Okay.

800
01:01:12.250 --> 01:01:12.840
Moderator: Okay.

801
01:01:13.530 --> 01:01:25.360
Moderator: So you should see this page. I'm going to go scroll through it slow. Let me know if you need me to speed up or slow down, and just think aloud, and let me know your thoughts and expectations on this page.

802
01:01:47.770 --> 01:01:48.930
P26: Slow down right there.

803
01:01:59.270 --> 01:02:02.159
P26: Confirmation email. Yeah, I remember that, too. Okay, go ahead.

804
01:02:03.050 --> 01:02:06.989
Moderator: Yeah. Was there anything else you were thinking about at this part that stood out to you?

805
01:02:06.990 --> 01:02:08.809
P26: I just wanna make sure I read it all.

806
01:02:11.410 --> 01:02:12.987
P26: and that's all. That's all. Pretty

807
01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:17.719
P26: go to your caregiver support program teams directly, or

808
01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:22.329
P26: verification is denied.

809
01:02:24.010 --> 01:02:26.800
P26: I didn't have to go through that because it wasn't denied. So

810
01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:29.320
P26: mobile family camera.

811
01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:36.179
P26: We're in a general caregiver support services called the caregiver support line.

812
01:02:38.310 --> 01:02:40.200
P26: No, all that, all that's pretty good.

813
01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:42.300
P26: I can understand everything there.

814
01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:48.330
P26: And I have. I actually have those numbers written down on my my paper here on my caregiver

815
01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:49.310
P26: file.

816
01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:53.160
Moderator: Okay, well, I mean.

817
01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:57.250
P26: No, that's all. That's all very helpful, very helpful, especially the phone numbers

818
01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:01.029
P26: and the contact information. Because

819
01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:03.249
P26: that that's that's very important.

820
01:03:04.970 --> 01:03:05.560
P26: 8.

821
01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:07.570
Moderator: Anything else you want to add about this page.

822
01:03:08.730 --> 01:03:10.460
P26: Not not that I can think of.

823
01:03:14.590 --> 01:03:15.449
Moderator: Great. I'm gonna.

824
01:03:15.450 --> 01:03:20.490
P26: Yeah, the main thing is having that phone number, that contact.

825
01:03:21.070 --> 01:03:23.520
P26: And also somewhere down there were.

826
01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:26.960
P26: Well, I guess they, they explained on the next letter, because that's when

827
01:03:28.090 --> 01:03:32.410
P26: they say it within 24Â h, or whatever they send you the email or whatever.

828
01:03:32.470 --> 01:03:34.958
P26: And that's when they tell you who you're

829
01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.450
P26: program representative is.

830
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.040
P26: And

831
01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:42.639
P26: the only thing I can say about that is, if they could not switch us

832
01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:45.199
P26: as often as they do.

833
01:03:45.930 --> 01:03:52.560
P26: because I have to deal with my representative at Tampa, general, I have to do. My representative at

834
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.139
P26: at the Va. Is for my

835
01:03:55.360 --> 01:04:01.580
P26: primary, medical, my caregiver, my community care.

836
01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:06.529
P26: and they every one of them switches somebody like every 3 months.

837
01:04:07.890 --> 01:04:09.170
Moderator: A lot to juggle.

838
01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:13.450
P26: And I think it's the Va's policy actually. So

839
01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:17.990
P26: there's not much you can do about it. But that would be helpful if you could keep the same person

840
01:04:18.610 --> 01:04:23.239
P26: so cause every time it's it's like it's like, when I go on a on a

841
01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:24.240
P26: on a

842
01:04:25.410 --> 01:04:27.530
P26: a medical visit appointment.

843
01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:38.180
P26: I never see the same doctor. I have to explain everything over every single time. The only one I've ever seen. That's the same as my primary. Thank God for her.

844
01:04:38.290 --> 01:04:39.379
P26: and she's great.

845
01:04:39.590 --> 01:04:52.670
P26: But every other doctor. You have to explain everything to them, and you know you can't remember this stuff. And when was the last time you had this. When's the last time you had? Well, I don't know. It's all in there. It's all in your

846
01:04:52.730 --> 01:05:00.470
P26: half of them. Don't even look at the stops one. But when I get there I got to tell them all the stuff. Well, anyway, I'm sorry I didn't mean to get off on her tension.

847
01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:03.759
P26: I haven't. I have not had any problem

848
01:05:04.390 --> 01:05:07.820
P26: contacting you guys. Of course I haven't needed to.

849
01:05:08.104 --> 01:05:14.379
P26: My wife has talked to you a couple of times, and so she's been great, and that you guys have called her and talked to her about stuff.

850
01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:21.019
P26: and that's been great. So I don't have any complaints about the the

851
01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:25.339
P26: the communications and everything between

852
01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:28.360
P26: myself and and your department.

853
01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:29.630
P26: So far.

854
01:05:29.970 --> 01:05:30.870
P26: so far.

855
01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:35.920
Moderator: That's good. Okay, well, I just have one last question for you. I was just curious. The

856
01:05:36.150 --> 01:05:41.539
Moderator: form, the amount of information provided in the form that we went through today. Just kind of those screens that you shared.

857
01:05:41.610 --> 01:05:45.090
