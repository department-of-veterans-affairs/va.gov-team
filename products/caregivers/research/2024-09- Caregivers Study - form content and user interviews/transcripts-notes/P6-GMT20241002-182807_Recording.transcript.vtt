8
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:37.610

Moderator : Okay.

12
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.819
Moderator : have you ever interacted with the Va for family member benefits?

13
00:00:50.318 --> 00:00:53.710
Moderator : Okay, can you tell me a little bit more about that?

14
00:00:54.492 --> 00:00:56.430
P6: I'm a caregiver from my father.

15
00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.639
P6: So I asked about like how to become a caregiver for my father to be a.

16
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.400
Moderator : Okay?

17
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.620
Moderator : And I guess along that can you tell me in your own words what it means to you to be a veteran caregiver?

18
00:01:09.961 --> 00:01:17.180
P6: Being there for them. Handle anything pertaining to the medical records, assistance medication

19
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.590
P6: giving and anything they basically need.

20
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.300
Moderator : Got it. Great thanks for explaining that.

21
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:32.650
Moderator : And how would you like to learn about benefits that are out there from the Va. Like the program of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers.

22
00:01:34.288 --> 00:01:41.549
P6: Through mailings email alerts on email notifications, phone calls and so forth.

23
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.299
Moderator : Okay, great.

24
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.029
Moderator : And if you were completing a form to apply for caregiver benefits like the one we're going to go through today.

25
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.150
Moderator : What information do you think you would need before you begin that form in that process.

26
00:01:55.237 --> 00:01:59.610
P6: My information, of course, and as well as the

27
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.835
P6: individuals information, I guess. Date of birth. Their name

28
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.620
P6: their address

29
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.190
P6: since they're already in the system, I think they already have

30
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.830
P6: there

31
00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:24.519
P6: veteran status, and so forth. But I guess if they, if they're not in there, and then I need to get a copy of that for them, too.

32
00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.760
Moderator : Okay, great thanks for sharing that with us.

33
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:39.930
Moderator : Okay, so now that we're kind of thanks for sharing that back, we're going to change gears just a little bit, and I'm going to share a link with you in chat and see if you could open it and share your screen with us. Please.

34
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:42.400
P6: So.

Moderator : Chat open.

36
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.620
Moderator : And this is just to our testing site that we'll be using.

37
00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.490
Moderator : Let me know if you need any

38
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.630
Moderator : help. Figure out how to get that open and share your screen. I can walk you through it.

39
00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:59.510
P6: No, I got it.

40
00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:00.340
P6: Okay, cool.

41
00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.980
P6: Oh, I need to share my screen.

42
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.339
Moderator : I don't see you sharing your screen yet.

43
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.940
P6: No, I said I had to share it home

44
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.050
P6: all right.

45
00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.100
Moderator : Awesome great.

46
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:34.640
Moderator : So could you please review the page and tell me what your initial thoughts and expectations are of this form. Before applying.

47
00:03:35.784 --> 00:03:39.430
P6: This is, apply for the program a comprehensive resistance, fulfilling

48
00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.940
P6: caregivers.

49
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:57.380
P6: pretty much all it says, and then it says, Start your application. So I guess, use this phone to apply for a program and comprehensive assistance for family members. Veterans can also use the application to add or change figures after they apply

50
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:11.289
P6: is there when it says assistance for family caregivers. What is a program? Comprehensive.

51
00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.120
Moderator : Yeah, I guess. What are your thoughts after reading that? And how would you expect to learn more.

52
00:04:19.071 --> 00:04:23.909
P6: I wanted to ask questions. I guess I would have to ask somebody from the I guess the Va. To

53
00:04:24.209 --> 00:04:25.809
P6: elaborate more on it.

54
00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:35.130
Moderator : Can you tell me more about that? Would you have expected somebody else to tell you about this? Is that what you have.

55
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.880
P6: Correct button is correct. Yeah.

56
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:48.969
Moderator : And I guess, looking at this page, if you were directed here, is there anything, if anything stands out as being really clear or really confusing.

57
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.969
P6: Oh, just basically, you're applying to be assistant to a caregiver to a family member who's a veteran.

58
00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:09.410
Moderator : On a scale of one to 5 and one being very poorly, and 5 being very well. How prepared and informed do you feel about the application

59
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:10.420
Moderator : you're about.

60
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:18.910
P6: I'm not being honest, is it's it's not really too explanatory, like, I would feel like more information should be provided like what

61
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.369
P6: what would constitute being a caregiver? What? What would you be

62
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:30.140
P6: able to do and assist with because they might have limitations, since it's a you know, Federal agency.

63
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.779
Moderator : Got it. Thanks for that feedback. So with that

64
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.639
Moderator : information missing that you're looking for

65
00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.259
Moderator : on a scale of one to 5, what would you rate the page.

66
00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:43.590
P6: A 3.

67
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.550
Moderator : Okay.

68
00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.110
Moderator : great, thank you.

69
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.680
Moderator : Okay. So now, I'd like you to just start the form as if you were applying for the program.

70
00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.409
P6: This part's really confusing, because it says, Start your application

71
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.079
P6: like you would click on that

72
00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.920
P6: to start it. But then

73
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:07.260
P6: the next thing it says, follow these steps to get started and check your eligibility. So what did that be beforehand?

74
00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.609
Moderator : Yeah. Is that how you'd prefer to have the flow happen.

75
00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:17.179
P6: Yeah, because I think it says, start your application. But then, like, why would it go? Okay, now, one to gather information like, wouldn't

76
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.219
P6: I don't know it just

77
00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.329
P6: I don't think you really need to say, start your application and just say, follow these steps to get started.

78
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:26.760
Moderator : Got it.

79
00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.270
P6: If I click, because if I click on this

80
00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:37.459
P6: I don't know where it's gonna bring me to like, is it? Gonna bring me up to these steps again, or these steps gonna be like in the background.

81
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:43.130
Moderator : Got it. That's really helpful feedback. Thank you for explaining that.

82
00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:49.020
P6: Alright. So you want me to start application. You want me to start from check eligibility.

83
00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:56.099
Moderator : Yeah, just kind of go through like what you would want to do, and just kind of look through this information and then

84
00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:59.679
Moderator : tell me how you would like to begin, or what you would do before beginning.

85
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:10.710
P6: Like, I said, I'm gonna reiterate like, I don't feel that start. Your application should be there. Because it's already telling you. Follow these steps to get started. So you check your eligibility.

86
00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:17.929
P6: You would click on this. Find out if you're eligible for your program of comprehensive assistance family caregivers.

87
00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:24.452
P6: and then number step 2. Once you fill that out, step 2. Gather the information you'll need

88
00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:25.710
P6: veterans

89
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:33.590
P6: you'll need the information for the veteran and each family caregiver. So that's what I thought I would need. I thought I would need there

90
00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.690
P6: some of the information, but.

91
00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.430
P6: I would think I might. I wouldn't necessarily need

92
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.119
P6: the information if I would just

93
00:07:44.165 --> 00:07:52.609
P6: speak with somebody, because they would have their information on file, I would imagine. But I guess if you, it's gonna be a form, fill that, then you have to have it.

94
00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:06.260
P6: You also need to share the Va Medical center where the Va. Receives care or plans to receive care.

95
00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:08.820
P6: got it.

96
00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.000
Moderator : Is there anything about that that caught you.

97
00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:20.510
P6: Yeah, because, like I would, I I would think, like

98
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:24.150
P6: they're already in the system nationwide.

99
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:25.930
P6: You're at the

100
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.080
P6: share, the the

101
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:31.400
P6: face center where the veteran gets care from. But.

102
00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:32.570
P6: like

103
00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:37.819
P6: states, have multiple

104
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:43.240
P6: Va centers, and you could go to multiple ones. So how would you enter more than one.

105
00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:51.809
P6: if it just if they go to multiple ones, you if you can only add one. I guess you add, like the main one, that they go to.

106
00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.300
Moderator : Got it. That's really helpful. Thank you for explaining that.

107
00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:06.430
P6: And then and if you're representative signing this application on behalf of the veteran.

108
00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:12.805
P6: you need to submit a document showing you have legal. Okay, that's how they could find it, I think.

109
00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:17.020
P6: yeah. So you have power attorney and legal authority to do so.

110
00:09:19.051 --> 00:09:24.170
P6: If you have any questions. You need assistance with the application. You could pull the phone number

111
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:36.160
P6: alright. See? That's what I'm saying now. It scrolled up and it says, Now, number 3 start your application. So that's why you don't need that that 1st part. Start your application.

112
00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.610
P6: And now it's gonna go back down there again.

113
00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:41.690
P6: Now, this is where you start your application.

114
00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:45.590
P6: You know what I'm saying.

115
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:48.639
Moderator : Yeah, thank you for sharing that feedback that's helpful for us.

116
00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:50.240
P6: Because, like

117
00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:53.930
P6: I gotta I kinda can. Can I click on this.

118
00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.369
Moderator : Yeah, go ahead.

119
00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:59.890
Moderator : It's actually the next step. We'll go through the form now.

120
00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:07.289
P6: No, I know, but I'm saying, see that that's the 1st part. If I clicked on this from the beginning, I would have missed all the other information.

121
00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:08.320
P6: Yeah.

122
00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:15.339
Moderator : Yeah, that's very helpful. Feedback kind of that 1st link was a little premature on the page is what you're saying.

123
00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:16.550
P6: Okay, yeah.

124
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:24.089
P6: So that's it. Should say, he start here, how I did it. And then, okay, here, are you ready to proceed? Click on this, and then

P6: so you enter the veteran's 1st name, middle name, last name

126
00:10:31.055 --> 00:10:39.569
P6: like, I said. They're Mr. Mrs. Their date of birth, and if they're female or male, and they hit, continue.

127
00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:51.649
Moderator : Yeah, if you, this is our testing sites. If you could go ahead and fill out that information, if you don't want to real use real information, feel free to use fake stuff, and I can prompt you with the social when we get there, too. So

128

Moderator : as you're going through this, if you try to think aloud of any reactions or anything that you're thinking of it, just let us know.

129
00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:33.790
P6: All right.

130
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:36.249
Moderator : Oh, and a fake one here you could do.

131
00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.250
Moderator : probably mix up the last number and do a 6 or a 7.

132
00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:41.979
Moderator : If you do sequential. It catches it

P6: zip code.

141
00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:27.710
P6: Bye.

142
00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.240
P6: Alright.

143
00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.710
P6: The phone number.

144
00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:03.950
P6: Oh, what va center

145
00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:10.369
P6: does your veteran plan to veteran get or plan to get their health care.

146
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:17.060
P6: Do I make it, or do I put one in.

147
00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:20.550
Moderator : Yeah, I guess. How would you prefer to search for

148
00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:22.530
Moderator : the veterans? Va. Facility.

149
00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:25.461
P6: I guess I'll put in

150
00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:27.240
P6: New Jersey.

151
00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:34.050
P6: right? And this is multiple ones.

152
00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:43.930
P6: That's so. Oh, okay, I was, gonna say, there's gonna be more load, more

153
00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.480
P6: load more.

154
00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:54.109
P6: I guess the closest one to that one.

155
00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:00.730
Moderator : Yeah, what are your thoughts and impressions as you were going through that search.

156
00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:04.480
P6: It was pretty simple self explanatory. It. It

157
00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:13.169
P6: put up one. At 1st I didn't see it, because I only saw like 4 or 5 locations. So I was like, well, where's the other ones? I know there's more other ones in the surrounding areas.

158
00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:18.750
P6: and it's just you had to load more and keep loading more. I just. I would think that

159
00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:25.040
P6: you won't have to load more. It could just be a whole list of it. And just it just be be smaller, smaller font.

160
00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.519
Moderator : Got it. Thanks for that feedback.

161
00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:32.140
P6: 5. Primary, family caregiver, application.

162
00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:34.300
Moderator : Yeah, actually, before we go.

163
00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:34.620
P6: Awesome.

164
00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:42.959
Moderator : Here you clicked off that other one pretty quickly. If you wanted to do a different search on that one, is it clear how you would do that?

165
00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:50.559
P6: Yeah, you do. The city. If you knew the city that's in, or is it? Or the postcode zip code.

166
00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:57.930
Moderator : And would you prefer to if you were doing this for would you put in city? Would that be your preferred? Search.

167
00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:01.410
Moderator : I know you put in state.

168
00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:11.889
P6: Yeah, because it was we statewide, because now the city is it asking the city where the Medical Center is in or the city that you're in, and we populated. What's around you.

169
00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:15.340
Moderator : Yeah. How would you think that search

170
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:16.550
Moderator : would work.

171
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:19.729
P6: It would be the location of the facility, I would imagine.

172
00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:24.140
P6: But if you didn't know where it was a city, then you had to put the State.

173
00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:25.780
P6: and they keep searching.

174
00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:27.020
Moderator : Got it.

175
00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:37.719
Moderator : Yeah, thank you for that additional feedback. And going back a step for me, you can go ahead and just enter the same search you did before, and select another location.

176
00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:51.500
P6: Okay.

177
00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:52.700
P6: Oh.

178
00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:56.599
Moderator : Yeah. Can you talk me through your impressions and your thoughts now that you see.

179
00:15:57.206 --> 00:15:59.630
P6: Told us this plan.

180
00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:01.780
P6: You're saying your support.

181
00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:06.010
P6: Alright. I'm confused, though, because now it it populated 2 different locations.

182
00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:13.089
Moderator : Yeah, can you just explain to me what you're thinking about as you're going through this.

183
00:16:13.401 --> 00:16:18.379
P6: The veterans facility selected. There's facility where you told us the veteran received your plans to

184
00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:22.060
P6: seek treatment. This is a James Howard veterans, outpatient clinic.

185
00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:24.474
P6: But

186
00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:34.800
P6: you're assigned caregiver support facility. This is the facility we've assigned to support you in the application process. As a caregiver. Okay, so they assign

187
00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:40.429
P6: the East Orange, Va. Medical Center as the support Coordinator Staff.

188
00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:44.070
P6: Okay. Got it.

189
00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:47.289
Moderator : Yeah, is there anything on that page that

190
00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:49.250
Moderator : you would change.

191
00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:56.560
P6: Yeah, it was a little confusing, because that's the the. It showed like 2 locations. But I didn't really, until I read it that

192
00:16:56.790 --> 00:17:03.470
P6: this is the place you chose. And now this is the, I guess, a main pub that that's going to be your point of contact

193
00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:07.060
P6: for the caregiver support coordinating staff.

194
00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:10.250
P6: Got it.

195
00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:21.269
Moderator : Thank you for walking through that with us. So now that you kind of gone through that facility piece overall on a scale of one to 5 of one being very difficult and 5 being very easy.

196
00:17:21.599 --> 00:17:25.660
Moderator : How would you rate this overall process to select a Va facility.

197
00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:27.310
P6: 4.

198
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:30.030
Moderator : Thank you.

199
00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:32.460
Moderator : You can continue on.

200
00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:34.345
P6: Alright.

201
00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:41.150
P6: you can use this application to apply for benefits for a primary family caregiver.

202
00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:42.690
P6: Yeah.

203
00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:43.480
Moderator : Doesn't.

204
00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:47.960
Moderator : What? What does a primary caregiver mean to you?

205
00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:52.699
P6: That you're the sole purpose you're the sole provider

206
00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:55.130
P6: assistant person to the.

207
00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:56.870
P6: to the patient.

208
00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:01.140
Moderator : Thanks for talking through that.

209
00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:10.169
Moderator : So yeah, if you could just go through a scenario where you're applying as if you're the primary caregiver on this application, and just kind of continue on, and thinking aloud.

210
00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:13.245
P6: Okay.

211
00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:17.680
P6: enter the primaries, families, caregivers. 1st name.

212
00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:26.780
P6: Oh, shit

213
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:04.999
P6: enter the date of birth.

214
00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:06.390
P6: My mail

215
00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:27.300
P6: that makes up.

216
00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:31.709
Moderator : The number a bit. If it's the same that we used for the veteran, it's probably flagging it.

217
00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.240
P6: Use the same address because I I live with him.

218
00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:52.550
P6: It's the primary family.

219
00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:54.410
P6: vigorous mail

220
00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.779
P6: address, the same as their home address. Yes.

221
00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:12.189
P6: I don't like when it's it's already populated, and it's being recorded. So it has. The right information

222
00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:14.909
P6: is that gonna show.

223
00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:19.850
Moderator : Got it. The auto populate pop up. That shows a little bit. Yeah.

224
00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:21.669
P6: Yeah, I don't like that

225
00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:38.220
P6: cool.

226
00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:07.900
Moderator : We'll just kind of continue on as if you were adding a secondary caregiver to the application as well.

227
00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:13.730
P6: I don't mind doing this, but it's being recorded, and it's doing my populated, and it has all my my personal information.

228
00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:15.310
P6: That's something I don't like.

229
00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:16.280
Moderator : Okay.

230
00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:20.539
Moderator : yeah, you can totally veto, and we won't share anything at all, too. So

231
00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:22.480
Moderator : no one will see it.

232
00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:32.170
Moderator : Because, as you're doing this? How do you think the secondary.

233
00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:32.559
P6: I thought you.

234
00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:33.280
Moderator : Role, differ.

235
00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:35.140
P6: So you said you can only add one.

236
00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:39.840
P6: It said it before. Is that only one can

237
00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:41.100
P6: be the

238
00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:43.449
P6: kick over in the 1st page.

239
00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:49.699
Moderator : Got it so it seems confusing that it's adding a secondary.

240
00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:56.400
P6: Right am I? Did I read it wrong? Because I thought I said in the 1st page it says they could only be one caregiver.

241
00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.029
P6: or did I miss it?

242
00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:02.909
Moderator : Yeah, you can go back, if you need to at all feel free.

243
00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:04.750
P6: And they go back all the way back.

244
00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:07.449
Moderator : Yeah, I guess

245
00:22:07.790 --> 00:22:13.279
Moderator : you just saw it was only one caregiver for the whole application. Not that there was a primary and secondary.

246
00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:19.370
P6: Oh, I don't know. I thought it was. Oh, maybe it's just one primary

247
00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:24.260
P6: to make his way. Stay a primary caregiver.

248
00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:27.579
P6: Oh, I I constitute it could just be one

249
00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:33.320
P6: one like when you say primary caregiver. I thought, that means like, that's a caregiver one.

250
00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:35.210
P6: Okay.

251
00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:09.379
Moderator : You were completing this online form for real. How would you go about getting this information for the secondary caregiver.

252
00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:11.120
P6: I would have to ask them for it.

253
00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:16.529
Moderator : Would you prefer to do that over the phone in person?

254
00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:20.469
P6: For the other person.

255
00:23:22.897 --> 00:23:29.649
P6: It could be either over the phone or in person. I probably end up filling this out with them.

256
00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:32.170
Moderator : Got it

257
00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:35.099
Moderator : so you'd probably sit down together in real life if you were to.

258
00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:35.860
P6: Doing? This?

259
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:37.420
P6: Yeah.

260
00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:40.330
Moderator : Thanks for letting us know that.

261
00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:56.235
P6: And the thing is, if

262
00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:05.260
P6: does it, I don't know how to be operate, but like, if I'm the primary care as as the

263
00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:09.899
P6: as a son. Am I allowed to be the primary caregiver opposed to his spouse?

264
00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:12.759
P6: Have to be at 1st like it's a like a power attorney.

265
00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:16.309
P6: you know, like, when you go to a funeral home

266
00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:20.930
P6: like one person has power turning over the other, and usually, if it's

267
00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:28.886
P6: the husband, the spouse has power like they're they're the

268
00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:33.320
P6: the 1st primary point of contact

269
00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:36.029
P6: opposed to like the sun.

270
00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:40.300
P6: so does that. Can it? Could be anybody or like.

271
00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:45.649
P6: does the veteran have to approve it like? I don't see something on here that the veteran approves. It.

272
00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:50.250
Moderator : Yeah. Can you tell me a little bit more about your expectation?

273
00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:52.189
Moderator : There? Should that be the.

274
00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:55.909
P6: Well, I would. Yeah, I would think that the veteran had the

275
00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:02.810
P6: How do you put it?

276
00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:09.559
P6: Allow permission for this individual? Because anyone could just go on there and say, Okay, hey, I'm gonna be their their caregiver, you know.

277
00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:15.799
P6: And maybe he doesn't want that person, or she doesn't want that person to be, and maybe he wants somebody else to be their caregiver.

278
00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:20.480
Moderator : Got it. That's really helpful. Feedback. Thank you.

279
00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:33.159
Moderator : It'd be like 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

280
00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:40.319
P6: Is it?

281
00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:41.569
P6: And hold on

282
00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.649
P6: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

283
00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:51.070
Moderator : I think that one's too long. It needs to be 9 digits.

284
00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:55.150
P6: Sure.

285
00:25:57.395 --> 00:25:59.170
P6: Yes, he is the same

286
00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:44.780
P6: new as a secretary, and add another one. No.

287
00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:47.070
P6: it's in

288
00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:50.590
P6: alright. Alright.

289
00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:57.339
P6: except for application. Signature next steps to review and sign the application.

290
00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:02.730
P6: Select who will sign for the veteran today?

291
00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:07.990
P6: Okay, I am veteran with legal authority, signing on the behalf of the veteran.

292
00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:15.720
P6: So if I click on that, I noticed it's something that you have uploaded document. So I don't have a document right now. So what do you want me to do?

293
00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:16.720
P6: Okay?

294
00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:24.839
Moderator : So I guess, in your own words. Kind of said it already, but you'd be uploading a document. I'm curious. Are you a legal representative for the veteran.

295
00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:25.460
P6: Correct.

296
00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:35.499
Moderator : Okay. So we'll continue on like as if you're filling it out for real to get some feedback on another page. And then we can kind of back out. Since you don't have a document to upload.

297
00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:37.689
Moderator : we won't do that in our staging site. But

298
00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:46.209
Moderator : yeah, if you could just talk through in your own words what you'd expect to happen next, and any feedback you have on the instructions to this page.

299
00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:53.430
P6: Yeah. Well, I do. I do have a a power attorney, but I'm not gonna upload that. But it is. I would upload the

300
00:27:53.720 --> 00:28:07.409
P6: the power attorney document which is legal buying contact, that I have power attorney from my father, who is a veteran, and I would upload it to the system that this says so you could submit. These are the following documents. You could submit with your power attorney, legal guardianship

301
00:28:08.899 --> 00:28:16.479
P6: alternate signer, certificate certification, appointment of veteran service organization.

302
00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:28.520
P6: appointment of individual as claim representative. Things accept marriage certificates and so forth. Upload it. In this certain type of files. Jpeg, Pdf.

303
00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:35.620
P6: No longer, and no no files larger than 10 MB. So you had to scan and upload and then hit. Continue.

304
00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:43.689
Moderator : Great. Thank you for walking through that. We can go back unless there's anything else you want to add about that.

305
00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:44.390
P6: No, ma'am.

306
00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:45.800
Moderator : Thing. Okay.

307
00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:47.300
Moderator : great. Thank you.

308
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.759
Moderator : So now we'll kind of change the answer to the veteran signing

309
00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:55.019
Moderator : for himself so he can skip that upload.

310
00:28:55.660 --> 00:29:05.599
Moderator : And then, yeah, if you just look over this page and tell me your initial impressions or expectations about what's happening on this page. And if you see anything you entered by mistake.

311
00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:08.540
Moderator : Can you show me how you'd go about correcting that.

312
00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:13.430
P6: Alright. So since 5 reviewed application. So he would

313
00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:16.240
P6: click on. Here. I'm reviewing my

314
00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.170
P6: the information.

315
00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:24.680
P6: If you need to change it all. I entered the wrong phone number. I would hit edit and change the digits.

316
00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:26.014
P6: Same thing with

317
00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:31.240
P6: the facility they, the the person, entered it wrong hit, edit

318
00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:39.620
P6: and correct like that veterans. Truth. I certify that the individual named in this application are involved in my care.

319
00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:40.940
P6: like I said

320
00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:46.090
P6: to sharing information necessary for the involvement in the right care.

321
00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:48.470
P6: And then you put the veteran's full name

322
00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:51.200
P6: click, I certify

323
00:29:52.530 --> 00:29:53.290
P6: that

324
00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:59.829
P6: And then primary family caregiver, application, truth of their put their name.

325
00:30:01.125 --> 00:30:01.850
P6: Get.

326
00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:04.200
P6: Can I say what's on my mind?

327
00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:05.500
Moderator : Of course.

328
00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:11.569
P6: I actually don't like this to be honest, because anybody could put the information in

329
00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:15.979
P6: like, who who's to say like, I'm submitting it to you.

330
00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:20.629
P6: to the Va. System. But how do you know that

331
00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:27.169
P6: somebody just didn't alter it? And, like the vitamins, are incoherent, and I'm filling this out for him.

332
00:30:29.888 --> 00:30:36.260
P6: I'm filling this out. I'm filling my name out, and it's not even asking me for anything. I would feel

333
00:30:37.410 --> 00:30:39.919
P6: that to be a caregiver.

334
00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:42.409
P6: that you wouldn't be able to

335
00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:47.150
P6: do it online, that you would have to actually go to the facility and talk to the person and face to face.

336
00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:54.570
P6: I don't know. Maybe I'm just adding, maybe I'm just adding to it, but I don't know. I just feel like it's anybody could just fill this out.

337
00:30:55.830 --> 00:31:05.600
Moderator : No, that's really helpful feedback to hear. Thank you for sharing that. I was. Gonna ask you what your comfort level was with filling out this information and signing for all the people involved. But

338
00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:08.199
Moderator : yeah, you kind of jumped to that.

339
00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:08.640
P6: Yeah.

340
00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:12.009
Moderator : So you were leading to. You'd rather have this be inform.

341
00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:22.369
P6: I feel that this person, sure that so it actually protects the agency. I would think if I was in the agency, I would feel more comfortable because

342
00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:25.470
P6: this is their form, and

343
00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:31.040
P6: if you allow, people just do it like this, and something transpires and be like, Can

344
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:35.909
P6: I don't know can they be sued? But like, I don't know, like I'm just thinking outside the box.

345
00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:45.449
Moderator : No, that's great, I guess if you had a magic wand, and how would you like this signing of the application to go when there's multiple people.

346
00:31:47.389 --> 00:31:56.219
P6: Like again. I I think this is something that would have to be generated and and done at the facility. So then there's witnesses there, and

347
00:31:56.350 --> 00:32:00.920
P6: like it's it's almost like a notary like that that person who's going there, I guess it's like.

348
00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:07.890
P6: you know, like an eligibility section department, that they were verified to that. They're there, that so and so date

349
00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:11.570
P6: so and so is filling it out so and so is going to. So there's a witness.

350
00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:14.030
Moderator : Got it.

351
00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:16.060
P6: So they don't just take it.

352
00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:20.569
P6: I mean, they're just to be honest. It just shows that the

353
00:32:25.325 --> 00:32:28.079
P6: I don't know it. It just shows you the the.

354
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:35.459
P6: I'm not saying that they don't care. I just say, Okay, you know, we just need something seriously. Do they have a caregiver

355
00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:40.879
P6: authority, and whoever they put it in. Okay, hey? They fill it out.

356
00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:46.799
P6: But we're not responsible who fills it out and and and know who that as long as they fill it out, that's it.

357
00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:49.950
P6: They take, they do. They take the word of the person.

358
00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:55.289
Moderator : Got it. Yeah, thank you for that feedback. That's helpful.

359
00:32:55.290 --> 00:32:59.470
P6: So that makes me wonder like if this is a if this is a legally binded contract.

360
00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:00.650
P6: that

361
00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:07.470
P6: because you're not really signing it, you're just putting it. And then you said, Yeah, I certified all this, but it's correct. But there's no like

362
00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:10.769
P6: notary. There's no witness. There's nothing

363
00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:11.880
P6: so.

364
00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:14.859
Moderator : Got it. Yeah.

365
00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:22.269
Moderator : okay, I guess before we go on to the next question, can you kind of scroll through this page and let me know if there's any other

366
00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:26.449
Moderator : feedback or thoughts that you want to share with us on this page.

367
00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:33.330
P6: No. So you knew the veterans day I would. If I was a veteran I would put my name primary

368
00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:39.259
P6: person. They would be the computer to fill this out. Secondary had to fill it out.

369
00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:44.140
P6: And that's another thing, too. That's what goes to me beforehand that

370
00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:49.879
P6: I would have to be with the other individuals to fill this out like I couldn't just

371
00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:58.219
P6: they couldn't be in another town like, or if they're at work, or if they're in another city, they would have to come to the house and and

372
00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:00.670
P6: do this application at the same time.

373
00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:05.980
P6: like I couldn't just write their name in. And it's like, Okay, I certify, because then that's illegal.

374
00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:08.960
P6: But then what stops me from doing it

375
00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:12.760
P6: kind of dance.

376
00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:25.940
P6: and then you hit, and then and then it says, no. According to Federal law, there are criminal penalties, including a fine or imprisonment up to 5 years for withholding information and providing inaccurate and incorrect information

377
00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:27.889
P6: that only goes so far.

378
00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:31.960
Moderator : Yeah, thanks for talking.

379
00:34:31.969 --> 00:34:32.299
P6: Okay.

380
00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:32.790
Moderator : Through that page.

381
00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:34.860
P6: Then you hit submit application.

382
00:34:35.409 --> 00:34:40.889
Moderator : Yeah, we won't actually submit it because we're in our testing site today. We won't actually submit it. But

383
00:34:41.139 --> 00:34:47.859
Moderator : I will stop you here. And I'm gonna screen share and show you what the page after this would look like if you did submit

384
00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:50.329
Moderator : and then get some feedback from you on that.

385
00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:55.239
P6: So stop sharing on my part or no.

386
00:34:55.570 --> 00:34:58.659
Moderator : Yep. And I think I can switch it over.

387
00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:02.899
Moderator : Oh, whoops!

388
00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:05.590
Moderator : Where?

389
00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:15.720
Moderator : Okay? That clicked on the right one wasn't outlining. Okay.

390
00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:28.100
Moderator : okay? So if we were submitting it for real, and we hit that submit application button. And you arrived at this page. Can you just tell me your thoughts and expressions here, or impressions here, and what you'd expect to happen next.

P6: and confirmation for your records, and you could print this, or you can write it down.

394
00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:55.329
P6: Yeah, what to expect next? If fam, a member of the caregiver support team

395
00:35:55.520 --> 00:36:04.590
P6: where the veteran receives care or plans to receive care will contract the veteran and any caregivers to discuss this application eligibility.

P6: Got it.

401
00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:33.679
Moderator : Is there anything on that page, if anything, that stood out

402
00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:36.909
Moderator : as being confusing or really helpful?

403
00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:40.469
P6: No, I just I like it gives you a phone number.

404
00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:44.140
P6: a directory to contact, and

405
00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:45.430
P6: if

406
00:36:46.605 --> 00:36:48.570
P6: the application denied.

407
00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:49.950
P6: But I

408
00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:53.760
P6: think you said, within 24 h you've received notice.

409
00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:58.370
P6: Yeah, you receive confirmation email within.

410
00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:06.679
P6: Well, that's if you you receive confirmation email that they received your application. But they didn't say like how long it would take for the process to take.

411
00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:10.320
P6: Hey?

412
00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:11.760
Moderator : See like a little bit more information.

413
00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:12.260
P6: Yeah.

414
00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:12.660
Moderator : Is here.

415
00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:18.189
P6: This could take, you know, whatever between like 2, 3 weeks, or 6 months. But I mean.

416
00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:19.160
P6: yeah.

417
00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:30.070
Moderator : Got it. Thank you for that feedback. Is there anything else on this page before I kind of stop screen sharing and wrap up a couple more questions.

418
00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:32.570
P6: No, I think it's pretty self explanatory.

419
00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:34.970
Moderator : Okay.

420
00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:37.400
Moderator : awesome. Thank you.

421
00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:46.460
Moderator : So if you were going through this form for real, what research would you do before applying and completing a form like this?

422
00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:51.169
P6: I would navigate, or something, or most likely

423
00:37:51.654 --> 00:37:58.135
P6: contact the agency itself, the facility, and and ask questions. How does this work what I need to do

424
00:37:58.670 --> 00:37:59.740
P6: then.

425
00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:03.830
P6: and go from there and then, and get like what I would need

426
00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:17.479
P6: prior to filling it out like if that facility, they would put me in touch with that department and to say, prior, so because you want, you want to go start applications like, Okay, I don't have this. So then they would hopefully would tell me that you're need the

427
00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:25.640
P6: you know the veteran, you know present, because they're gonna have to sign afterwards and give authorization

428
00:38:26.064 --> 00:38:29.709
P6: you would have to have your form of either

429
00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:33.000
P6: a power attorney, or if you're married to the person

430
00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:50.260
P6: marriage certificate, the different type of forms, like all the all the pre things that you will need prior before sitting down to apply. Because if you start doing this process. You're gonna have to stop. Because, okay, I don't have that. Okay. So now, I don't have authority or I don't have that. So I need to have this. I need to be able to scan the document.

431
00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:52.389
P6: We're having it ready in my files.

432
00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:57.049
P6: I need to have the veterans, you know, date of birth, social security number and all that. And then

433
00:38:57.330 --> 00:39:01.389
P6: if there's gonna be more than one, if you're gonna be going to be one primary

434
00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:13.310
P6: a caregiver. So that'd be the person that has the, you know, power attorney or marital certificate. And if they want to be a second person, you gotta just let them know that they gotta be

435
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:15.670
P6: present while you're filling the application

436
00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:21.489
P6: and and go from there so everything so they could be done at one time, and and and proceed.

437
00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:24.289
Moderator : Got it. That's really.

438
00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:27.759
P6: Cause. It doesn't say any of that in the beginning, because I would feel that

439
00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:29.689
P6: it should say that.

440
00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:39.460
P6: you know, like a an asterisk like like an alert, saying, Hey, please! I don't know how much we put in there, but please be advised that your need

441
00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:51.400
P6: these information, these these documents whatever prior to completing the application. And if more than one caregiver, and then they need to be present so they can sign.

442
00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:53.670
P6: And I also feel that

443
00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:55.950
P6: I mean, we work

444
00:39:55.970 --> 00:39:58.210
P6: in the modern day society that

445
00:39:58.560 --> 00:39:59.390
P6: that

446
00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:04.930
P6: you know they work with adobe. You know a lot of stuff that you can actually digitally sign.

447
00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:08.730
P6: and I feel that it should be something like a dropbox that you could digitally sign

448
00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:11.959
P6: your signature. So it's not just like you typing your name.

449
00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:16.669
Moderator : Yeah, that's great feedback. Thank you for bringing that up.

450
00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:29.100
Moderator : What are your thoughts of the amount? Information that was provided on the form as we went through it, as far as caregiver, who qualifies, do you think it was too much just enough or too little.

451
00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:36.309
P6: No, I think it was just enough. I think that's just vital information that's needed. So they have all that information. But it didn't ask

452
00:40:36.693 --> 00:40:42.086
P6: oh, yeah, it did ask the date of birth. Yeah. So I think, no, it it asks for everybody's

453
00:40:43.978 --> 00:40:50.699
P6: information. Ss, number their location, their their relation to the the veteran, and so forth.

454
00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:58.510
Moderator : So was there any additional information about who qualifies as a primary secondary that you would have liked to see.

455
00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:06.059
P6: Yeah, because can anybody just be the person's caregiver? It just has to be a certain criteria that

456
00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:12.099
P6: like it's had to be a blood relative, or does it? Could it be a friend? When you? Because the word

457
00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:17.239
P6: caregivers use loosely because it's not like, Hey, this person has power attorney.

458
00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:20.490
P6: but

459
00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:26.320
P6: it can't just be anybody, because it it says, upload these documents that you would have to

460
00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:32.330
P6: if you have authorization from it. But you can have a document, I guess, notarized from

461
00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:45.340
P6: an attorney or a notary notary public. That this veteran saying that you could authorize it so it could be just a friend, you know, because the persons have other family members, or he wants this friend to be a caregiver.

462
00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:54.329
P6: so it could. Just I just feel like it should be put out there like, who can be a caregiver like it says that like this is what you would have to have.

463
00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:56.940
P6: But it doesn't say like, who can be it?

464
00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:02.169
Moderator : That's really helpful. Thank you for talking through that.

465
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:03.680
Moderator : Okay.

466
00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:08.519
Moderator : Anything else that you want to add, or any questions for me.

467
00:42:10.241 --> 00:42:14.870
P6: No, I think we covered a lot of stuff. I I just I feel like I was able to provide.

468
00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:16.942
P6: you know, valuable feedback for you.

469
00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:18.300
Moderator : Very much, so.

470
00:42:19.050 --> 00:42:19.929
P6: I appreciate it.

471
00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:25.149
Moderator : Yeah, definitely appreciate it a lot. So I just wanna circle back and reconfirm

472
00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:34.569
Moderator : if you're comfortable. If we decided to share video clips of this session with Va. Partners. You can veto it since it did the pop up thing. I just want to give you that opportunity. Now.

473
00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:42.949
P6: Yeah, I don't want my other information pop up to be. If it wasn't propped up then I would have no problem. But since it's being popped up. I don't want my information to be present.

474
00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:45.429
Moderator : Got it will do. We won't share.

475
00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:56.610
Moderator : Okay? Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. And your feedback is really really helpful. As we continue to work on this form and the site for veterans and caregivers, so.

476
00:42:56.610 --> 00:42:57.389
P6: Thank you so much.

477
00:42:57.390 --> 00:43:07.079
Moderator : Yeah. And Perry, Gn, who recruited you, they'll be sending you a thank you. Note with a little blurb that you can pass along. If you know of any other veterans or caregivers that want to participate in future studies.

478
00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:08.620
P6: Okay, thank you so much.

479
00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:09.909
Moderator : Yeah, have a great day.

480
00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:10.530
P6: You too.
