00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:08.549
Moderator: Okay, I've started the recording. So just to confirm, are you comfortable? If I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

2
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.200
P14: Yes.

3
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:17.410
Moderator: Okay? And are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other Va partners, and we'll let

4
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.180
Moderator: be blurring out any identifiable information.

5
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:21.250
P14: Yes.

6
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.590
P14: Yeah. Okay.

7
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.890
Moderator: We'll ask it at the end, too. If you change after we go through what we are doing today. Okay? So

8
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:47.789
Moderator: before we look at the caregiver program online form. If I can talk today, we have a couple of warm up questions for you about your caregiver experience. So you've said, you've never have you ever applied for the comprehensive assistance for family caregivers, or you said you weren't enrolled.

9
00:00:48.100 --> 00:01:01.790
P14: I don't think that I don't think that we ever were. I do know that at some point I was a I was a caregiver for my dad, who is an army veteran. And he was in hospice, and then we had some

10
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:16.240
P14: sort of we had some Va. In the middle of it. The Va. Contacted us, and I didn't, you know. And I I think it was because of the way that we had everything set up, and he was set up in tricare but it was. It seemed like an ad hoc thing, and I

11
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:24.264
P14: actually can't recall if I reached out to anybody in the Va. But there was a lot of because he was a veteran. There was a lot of

12
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:32.720
P14: contact that was made during the time that he, as he was getting, you know, really more fragile before he passed away.

13
00:01:33.242 --> 00:01:40.199
P14: But before then I had just helped him with a lot of the his regular tricare visits, and not like anything that was

14
00:01:41.142 --> 00:01:43.370
P14: explicitly Va related.

15
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.220
Moderator: Thanks for sharing that here.

16
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.360
Moderator: Okay, so you have heard from the of the program before.

17
00:01:52.332 --> 00:01:54.209
P14: I I mean, I've heard of

18
00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:01.089
P14: support programs. I don't remember if I've heard anything about comprehensive care. So I you know. So

19
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.606
P14: yeah, if.

20
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.850
Moderator: Have you ever interacted with the Va. For other family member or caregiver benefits before.

21
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.340
P14: no, I have not. I'm trying to think

22
00:02:14.791 --> 00:02:19.609
P14: cause my uncle was in the army, but we didn't really. Yeah, we didn't really

23
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.200
P14: do much

24
00:02:21.794 --> 00:02:27.769
P14: explicitly with the Va. I did do a several phone calls, and we got some supplies and things for my dad.

25
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:35.470
P14: but that was about it, and that was a I remember being a little bit surprised, and, you know, ungrateful. But I didn't. I was like I don't know what.

26
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.150
P14: I don't know what the impetus for this was to be honest.

27
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.360
Moderator: Got it.

28
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.960
P14: So.

29
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.560
P14: okay.

30
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.730
Moderator: Can you tell me in your own words what it means to be a veteran caregiver?

31
00:02:49.326 --> 00:02:52.809
P14: Great question. I mean

32
00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.415
P14: because I was the daughter of a veteran. Right? It.

33
00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.180
P14: I knew

34
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.800
P14: a lot

35
00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:25.089
P14: about the military to begin with. So I think that was a good point or a good background and context to have with regard to veteran affairs, to know that there is, there are representatives that could support veterans in different, you know, across different needs. I did know some of the possibilities of getting extra

36
00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:33.680
P14: financial support through the Va. From for my dad's care as he aged.

37
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.189
P14: I just didn't really have much information about how to go.

38
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:44.599
P14: how to access that other than being told that there was a lot of paperwork and then

39
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.639
P14: And then, knowing that there were some hospices that that cater to veterans needs, like

40
00:03:52.084 --> 00:03:58.859
P14: the gratitude for service because there were a couple of people who came by from a hospice that was that focused on Va

41
00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:00.630
P14: the

42
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.174
P14: the surprise, the pleasant surprise that

43
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:12.260
P14: by getting some of the supplies that we did because we got some, you know, bed covers and different things like that, because he had a hospital bed.

44
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.240
P14: But

45
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.999
P14: but it was also

46
00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.730
P14: I didn't have a lot of background. So I remember thinking, I wish there was a better way that

47
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.340
P14: veterans could be briefed on this, or could get

48
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:31.680
P14: understand better what their what their rights were, especially so far out from retirement. I mean, I think you get a lot

49
00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.803
P14: as you're coming up to retirement. I know my dad did, but

50
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:43.438
P14: And then there were certain things that you might need as your active duty or not, or even in the reserves.

51
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:44.710
P14: But

52
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.560
P14: but there wasn't a lot of public

53
00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.060
P14: information about it unless you were

54
00:04:51.100 --> 00:05:00.020
P14: directly, you know, needed to go to the hospital, or you were still active, and you may have gotten wounded, or things like that. So, or if you had a disability?

55
00:05:00.546 --> 00:05:04.550
P14: There are other things. So it was kind of hard for me, as a

56
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.180
P14: hasn't

57
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.429
P14: advocate for health to know

58
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.100
P14: what specific things. I should

59
00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:17.670
P14: I could get word from my dad, from the from the Va. And then to have an understanding, as I'm a veteran myself and

60
00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.449
P14: my husband is. And so it was.

61
00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:29.420
P14: Yeah, it will it? Knowing a lot more about the tricare, you know, the active health health support was what we were

62
00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:30.990
P14: most

63
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.929
P14: focused on, and I think there needs to be maybe more

64
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.790
P14: publicity or better ways of informing

65
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:46.240
P14: service members, especially retired service members of the service services that are available to them, because it seems like, because there's such a long delay that

66
00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:56.420
P14: between like, say retirement, and when you really need support. That it would, unless you're you know you have a disability or or

67
00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:03.561
P14: or something conflict. Trauma, you know that would. It was just hard to know if that makes sense.

68
00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:05.010
Moderator: Yeah, it does.

69
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.890
Moderator: Great, that's really great feedback. Thank you.

70
00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:14.080
Moderator: So on that topic as a caregiver, how would you like to learn about programs like the program

71
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:21.640
Moderator: for comprehensive assistance, for family caregivers. In what ways other than kind of an ad hoc ish, would you like to learn about that?

72
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:27.200
P14: I mean, that's a great point, especially, for I think there's a missed, potentially missed opportunity

73
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:41.709
P14: for people who are who have like tricare coverage. Because there's so many different networks now, because, like I'm I'm part of the uniformed Services family health Care Plan, which is tricare prime and a lot of network providers are actually confused.

74
00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:43.150
P14: Cause like.

75
00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:51.320
P14: we're in an area that we can go to Johns Hopkins or Johns Hopkins community care. So they're like under this tricare umbrella

76
00:06:51.568 --> 00:07:01.849
P14: but because there are a lot of civilian doctors, and and they know the military, but they don't, because they're like look close to them in a base or whatever, wherever so they've seen them. A lot of them. They don't know some of the

77
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:05.410
P14: some of the needs. I just know that that's a

78
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:11.110
P14: they get insurance paid that we have insurance, and they get insurance, you know, payments.

79
00:07:11.463 --> 00:07:19.669
P14: And I. So I think if there was a way for tricare to sort of like. Have a list, you know. Va, the Va. And tricare to have a better

80
00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:23.980
P14: a better partnership, so that

81
00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:34.240
P14: the Va. Was like. Oh, these are all the folks who are in a particular health insurance, a military health insurance, and we know that they're going to be transitioning into Medicare plus.

82
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.430
P14: you know, plus tricare, and our aging. If we could

83
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:40.620
P14: get the the

84
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:48.837
P14: insurance providers who are in, or the providers who are under that tricare to have va

85
00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:51.970
P14: information to provide to

86
00:07:52.376 --> 00:07:59.289
P14: veterans as they're like going to their regular wellness right? Oh, by the way, did you know that you could do this in addition to

87
00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:08.509
P14: your services, or we should help you enroll with this, and not necessarily make that the provider's job, but at least make it a conduit.

88
00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:12.230
P14: because otherwise it is ad hoc, right? It is me finding out

89
00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:18.510
P14: as a surprise, trying to be a better advocate for my dad or maybe even my kids trying to be a better advocate for me.

90
00:08:19.036 --> 00:08:31.290
P14: It's it's it's very ad hoc and we have to go out and go to the Va. Site and figure out what what that means, and navigate that rather than another healthcare person who works with the military, saying.

91
00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:35.510
P14: Here's an information brochure. Maybe you should go here

92
00:08:36.078 --> 00:08:44.680
P14: and then, or and register, or something like that. Did you know cause it kind of was a hunt, a hunt and peck instead of a.

93
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:58.119
P14: you know. Here's the conduit cause we still would have to go and do our own work, anyway. But just not, you know, not even. It's like a awareness lack of awareness, unless you go out and you become an advocate. And then you go. Oh.

94
00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:03.360
P14: look at all this stuff, you know that I should have done a year ago, right? So that's you know.

95
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:09.000
Moderator: Awesome. Thank you for that feedback that's really helpful for us to hear all that detail.

96
00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:12.590
P14: I hope it. Yeah.

97
00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:13.283
Moderator: It helps.

98
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:14.720
P14: So.

99
00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:24.539
Moderator: If you were completing a caregiver benefit form today, like the one that we're going to go through. What information do you think you would need to have before completing the form.

100
00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:25.889
P14: Oh, that's a good

101
00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:29.689
P14: question. I mean how

102
00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.849
P14: how any caregiver support

103
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:37.789
P14: is is related to.

104
00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.160
P14: You know the current

105
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:44.419
P14: care that they might be eligible, for, because it's the same thing that happens.

106
00:09:44.807 --> 00:10:00.239
P14: In a in several years. Probably in 8 years or so, I'm going to be looking at Medicare, and so I helped my mom with it. But it was really not clear how medicare coverage overlapped with tricare coverage, and how

107
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:06.630
P14: any of those other services overlapped with any existing coverage. I think

108
00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:15.510
P14: people forget, unless like you said like, I said, unless they're they're folks who have active disabilities when they were in the service that

109
00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:20.460
P14: that allow them that connection, you know, to stay. Keep that connection with the Va.

110
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:31.150
P14: Or unless you know, they're coming off duty and are getting care by the Va. So that their primary care, or their, you know, insurance, or whatever it might be, has that sort of connection.

111
00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:39.649
P14: Most people who are really healthy veterans who may need extra care because of their because of the service that they provided to the country

112
00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:41.140
P14: don't even know

113
00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:44.300
P14: that that's available, because they've just gone, and.

114
00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:53.120
P14: you know, done the the usual thing. And then all of a sudden, the Va. Says, Oh, there's a veteran in our roles, and they're in hospice. Maybe we should reach out and contact them.

115
00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:54.310
P14: So

116
00:10:54.470 --> 00:11:02.170
P14: yeah, so I think it needs to be more proactive and just stronger conduits with existing care, especially for people who

117
00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:02.950
P14: oh.

118
00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:04.750
P14: who have been.

119
00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:16.140
P14: you know, who've been retired for a while. I noticed that with the same thing happened in with the reserves is that they had to do an overhaul of like reserve retirement, because many people in the reserves

120
00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:28.320
P14: don't actually touch base again until until you know, several years after they've retired before all the retirement services kick in when they turn 60. So there's kind of a

121
00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:31.099
P14: it's very easy to forget

122
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:37.626
P14: that these people are out there, and that the services exist and should be provided to them for their service.

123
00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:44.809
P14: so it's like, almost on the the onus is on the service member, which is great, we should all be responsible for our care. But

124
00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:46.490
P14: but when

125
00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:59.039
P14: you know, when you don't even know that there's an array of services that can be there. You you can't even you don't even know what to fill out, and you don't know how it overlaps with anything else, or whether it makes you ineligible, some for something or not.

126
00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:00.490
P14: So.

127
00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.790
Moderator: It's really helpful feedback. Thank you for sharing all of that.

128
00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:12.410
P14: I hope so. Yeah, I know I've I've done interviews like this, too. So sometimes I'm like, Well, maybe it's too much.

129
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:14.050
Moderator: No, it's all good.

130
00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:20.030
Moderator: So now we kind of got through that background a bit. Now let's change gears. I'm gonna put a link

131
00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:26.509
Moderator: in the chat for you to open and share your window. This is our testing site, as we had mentioned earlier. So

132
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:32.629
Moderator: if you could just open that page, and then share your screen with me in zoom, and let me know when you're ready.

133
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:34.259
P14: Then I have

134
00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:35.829
P14: bunch of stuff.

135
00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:37.320
P14: Yeah.

136
00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.779
Moderator: Close. Take your time. Close in whatever you need to.

137
00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.610
P14: Can you see that?

138
00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:42.590
P14: Yep.

139
00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:43.030
Moderator: I can see.

140
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:46.980
P14: Yeah, okay, is that big enough? Or should I make it.

141
00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:50.670
Moderator: Yeah, do it. However, it works for you. However, you would normally do it. It's fine.

142
00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:53.760
P14: And I'm gonna be looking at the second screen. So I'm gonna be looking at it.

143
00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:54.770
Moderator: Okay.

144
00:12:55.190 --> 00:13:04.180
Moderator: yeah. So I guess on this page, if you could review this page, and just remember to think aloud and tell me your initial thoughts and expectations of what you see here.

145
00:13:08.083 --> 00:13:11.710
P14: I mean in terms of a form it looks

146
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:12.930
P14: it's got good

147
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:14.530
P14: usability.

148
00:13:18.047 --> 00:13:23.759
P14: Of course, this Va form 10. Is this the is that the form that's just been digitized here.

149
00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:26.529
Moderator: Yeah, is that how you take that label.

150
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:31.010
P14: Yeah, that's how I take that label. And so I'm not sure.

151
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.931
P14: Yeah. So that's that's fine.

152
00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:38.700
Moderator: Can you explain what you're thinking about there? What triggered that form

153
00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:39.680
Moderator: mentioned.

154
00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:47.221
P14: Yeah, I mean, I was just. I was wondering. Oh, is there more information? Should this be linked? Should there be a link here that gives me more information of it, or back

155
00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:56.509
P14: in the background. Is it a requirement for the Va to to identify the form that it's this digital representation is from

156
00:13:56.915 --> 00:14:01.879
P14: cause if it is, if it is, that's fine. But I don't really see the need for it.

157
00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:12.440
P14: I mean, it could be some that Va form identifier could be somewhere even lower, or, you know, not even cause it's kind of it made me stop and go. Do I need another form. What do I need to do?

158
00:14:12.885 --> 00:14:26.249
P14: Was there, you know. So I don't know from a user interface perspective, if this is necessary, or if it could be a footnote unless it's a requirement that when you present this information digitally, you have to identify the

159
00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:28.600
P14: source form from which it came.

160
00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:31.900
P14: But that's a small thing. Most people would probably gloss over it.

161
00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:52.000
P14: One thing that I would like to see is like a definition of what this is right, it says, use this form to apply for the program of comprehensive existence assistance for family caregivers. But there should be a sentence somewhere that says this thing can can give you.

162
00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:56.050
P14: You know our program is here to to support

163
00:14:56.992 --> 00:14:59.890
P14: family members or friends who are

164
00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:02.380
P14: who are helping support

165
00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:13.960
P14: the holistic care veterans, or something like that, because now that we've talked about it, I know. And now that you asked me for a Usability study, I know that this is a program. But before then I didn't even

166
00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:23.242
P14: know what it was. And that and also that's why I asked you if I never registered. Does that mean that I'm not eligible to give you feedback. So

167
00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:31.529
P14: I mean, in terms of the user interface. This is great right cause. It tells you. Step one step, 2,

168
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:33.430
P14: right? What? You'll need.

169
00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:40.660
P14: this. It might be nice to have a link

170
00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:50.000
P14: to the Va. Medical centers here, right? You also need to share the Va. Medical center rather than somebody having to look it up and say, did I get the name right? Did I get that, you know? Is it.

171
00:15:51.099 --> 00:16:01.289
P14: Walter Reed, what? What other than than Walter Reed? Is there? Because some people don't remember. They just go. Oh, I go to the Va. Place that's near my, that's in my hometown.

172
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:05.075
P14: Right? They don't say, but if there's a and I know you have a database

173
00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:10.870
P14: of them, so if you could just put, you know, a pull down there that says, you know, select from this

174
00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:14.240
P14: list of where you go. That would be great.

175
00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:19.030
P14: because it would offload work for the user.

176
00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:22.169
P14: this is.

177
00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:31.020
P14: it might be good to have video

178
00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:36.969
P14: a little bit embedded video that says, Hey, you know, if you want to go here. You can go to this.

179
00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:39.720
P14: follow this link. But let me tell you, and

180
00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:43.290
P14: and 2 shakes what this thing is, rather than having to

181
00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:44.710
P14: cause. I know that

182
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:47.289
P14: a lot of veterans

183
00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:52.770
P14: would have to make this a lot bigger to read it if it if it's a caregiver, even if it's a caregiver.

184
00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:54.651
P14: you know, like I was

185
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:56.699
P14: You know, I'm older, too.

186
00:16:57.328 --> 00:17:03.189
P14: So it would just be nice in terms of when you're trying to find care for somebody to have a little video that says.

187
00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:06.820
P14: by the way, this is what this is, what the program is, right?

188
00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:13.979
P14: so that you can help make. Yeah, make your parent, you know. So a little video noted right here in the middle

189
00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:22.169
P14: would be very cool. But the information is good. It's just can you make it in multi channels, multimedia channels?

190
00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:25.180
P14: The hotline is good.

191
00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:31.819
P14: like this right? Because this is

192
00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:34.830
P14: similar to what I would.

193
00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:38.489
P14: What I would do for the for the find, the

194
00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:47.189
P14: you know list your Va. Medical Center. That would be great if you have that, or even easier. If you have a instead of the

195
00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:51.080
P14: directory, if you have the pull down that says, select where you're

196
00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.639
P14: coming from.

197
00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:57.850
P14: or where you take your parent to, or your sister to, or your spouse to.

198
00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:08.974
P14: Okay. And I like that start is at the top and at the bottom, because a lot of people will just go. I'm not reading this. I'm gonna start

199
00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:10.840
P14: so

200
00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:12.310
P14: awesome.

201
00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:15.609
Moderator: Yeah, thank you for all of that feedback. It's really helpful to talk through

202
00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:18.319
Moderator: on a scale of one.

203
00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:26.200
Moderator: Yeah, before we start, though, one question on a scale of one to 5, 1 being very poorly, and 5 being very well.

204
00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:30.980
Moderator: How prepared and informed do you feel about starting this application?

205
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:32.460
Moderator: And why.

206
00:18:34.293 --> 00:18:52.199
P14: Good question. I don't know if I want. I I'd have to just say Oh, I would have to find a day, probably the weekend, where I would have the 15 min when I'm you know, or I'll be sitting next to my dad, or something like that. And when I have the 15 min to look up all this information.

207
00:18:52.694 --> 00:18:58.719
P14: Otherwise I would be. I would want to have the video or the information. You know here.

208
00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:12.810
P14: like, what is what is this? Sorry? What is this program about before I started? And I don't. I don't even know. You know you may be eligible, but you're you're not. Oh, but if you're relative, yes, okay, you know. So I have to.

209
00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:15.930
P14: yeah, I have to.

210
00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:22.460
P14: It would be really nice if there was a video that goes through all these questions and the fact, and then also includes this

211
00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:27.139
P14: this fact. Or FAQ, because

212
00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:29.890
P14: the main reason why I know that

213
00:19:30.323 --> 00:19:34.399
P14: this is even possible is because you, because I was looking at the

214
00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:35.670
P14: the

215
00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:38.120
P14: are you willing to participate in research?

216
00:19:38.542 --> 00:19:50.389
P14: That, said I would at least start it and see I would have enough information to go. No, this is where I can get some, some, some relief, maybe, or some help that I might need cause. It's a lot of care.

217
00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:59.019
P14: so I would probably still start. But I wouldn't. I would feel like 50 50 in terms of how prepared I am other than

218
00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:04.239
P14: this stuff, the social security number, and that you know the explicit things that you need.

219
00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:08.480
Moderator: Got it so 50, 50, maybe a 2 and a half.

220
00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:12.220
P14: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Sorry. Yeah. So like 3, yeah, 3, maybe 3,

221
00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:14.332
P14: 2 and a half or 3. Yeah, neutral.

222
00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:18.690
Moderator: Sounds great. Yeah. So now, if you could go ahead and start the form.

223
00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:20.089
P14: See one to 5.

224
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:26.700
P14: So how do you want? How do you want me to do the dummy data

225
00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:28.360
P14: any just the same?

226
00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:37.969
Moderator: You could enter in real stuff if you're comfortable with it, or enter in fake information. If not, and I will prompt you on the social security number to give you fake one there.

227
00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:44.190
Moderator: and it's our testing site. So you don't have to worry about it going anywhere. But just use what you're comfortable with.

228
00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:50.844
P14: I mean he's passed away now. But

229
00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:55.609
P14: What's the social security.

230
00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:57.100
Moderator: We'll do. 3, 2, 1.

231
00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:00.309
Moderator: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

232
00:21:25.784 --> 00:21:27.134
P14: Oh, county

233
00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:32.550
Moderator: Yeah, what are you thinking as you go through that field.

234
00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:33.150
P14: Oh.

235
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:34.902
P14: I'm sorry! What's that?

236
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:37.540
Moderator: What were you thinking as you were going through that field.

237
00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:45.510
P14: I wasn't sure. I I thought I could look at this. Yeah, okay, makes sense. Yeah.

238
00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:55.100
P14: But I guess, yeah. So now I that makes more sense, because the if there's an OP occupational therapist that needs to come by, it would be nice for them to know where they need to.

239
00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:59.009
P14: You know where they need to drive what their network is in terms of providing

240
00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:02.990
P14: help. Or if there's a physical therapist that needs to come to the house, or something like that.

241
00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:06.940
P14: or a nurse that needs to check blood pressure, etc, etc.

242
00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:10.579
P14: That would be. It would be good to know the county.

243
00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:13.690
P14: So thanks for.

244
00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:19.089
Moderator: Going back and explaining that. So yeah, if you can continue on and just keep thinking aloud, as you've been doing.

245
00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:25.472
P14: None of these work, by the way, anymore.

246
00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:32.280
Moderator: Is it the Autofill you mean, or what's not working.

247
00:22:32.964 --> 00:22:39.230
P14: I mean, that is so that these are these are not. These are real numbers, but they don't. They're no longer.

248
00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:42.730
P14: They're just because I remember, yeah, yeah, yeah.

249
00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:50.390
P14: whoops.

250
00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:52.270
P14: Oh.

251
00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:02.979
P14: I mean, these are all easy to fill out right?

252
00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:09.429
Moderator: Yeah. So just keep thinking aloud as you go through this question.

253
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:14.629
P14: Yeah, see, this is the this is where the like. The the pull down would be better

254
00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:16.620
P14: to have

255
00:23:17.183 --> 00:23:21.716
P14: rather than or just, or or here you could say

256
00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:30.700
P14: if based on your address that you just entered in because we entered in all that at that data you should be able to create a select query

257
00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:37.480
P14: for your database that pulls back all the ones that are in a hundred mile radius of that. I mean, you know target

258
00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:40.899
P14: best, buy home depot. They all do that. So

259
00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:43.560
P14: it's technically feasible

260
00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:44.849
P14: to do it.

261
00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.180
P14: yeah. So I don't know.

262
00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:49.860
P14: Oh, yeah.

263
00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:50.400
Moderator: Yes.

264
00:23:51.710 --> 00:24:00.619
Moderator: you would prefer to, I guess not. Search for Va. Facility. You'd mentioned a dropdown like a list, or just have it recommended to you. Is that correct?

265
00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:13.109
P14: I mean. I think so. I think if if the if it can't find anything close to the veteran right? I think it should be a a dropdown, so I think it should be 2 steps, I should think, in this, in this

266
00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:32.740
P14: and all this information I mean, you are asking for the county, so you could know how to bring a a care team to the home or to help the veteran get to a care team right? If you have this information in an application or in the database already.

267
00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:34.469
P14: you could definitely.

268
00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:52.229
P14: technically feasible to have from here, in this next thing a under the hood program that would select from the list of medical Va. Medical centers or clinics that are within a 50 mile radius or 100 mile radius of that

269
00:24:52.400 --> 00:25:01.960
P14: that address that I typed in, and that would result in a pull down that gives those centers. And then an option to say, I want to go.

270
00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:05.890
P14: you know. I don't want, you know. Don't use my address. Give me all of them.

271
00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:09.319
P14: so that in case I'm moving around I could

272
00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:10.909
P14: select a place

273
00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:15.112
P14: rather than me having to go. Wait! I don't know where my dad goes.

274
00:25:15.959 --> 00:25:42.110
P14: I have to go look it up, and I have to go out of this form, and I have to go into either his paperwork, you know, print paperwork because he would like print paperwork better, or I have to go to another website and look it up and then come back to the application. And you know you have our information right there. I gave you a whole bunch of information, and you told me why you needed the county, and so I'm like, well, then, you know why I would need an easier way to

275
00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:43.810
P14: 2

276
00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:50.059
P14: to to look up, you know, or be recommended a place that I could take my dad

277
00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.179
P14: so for now I'll just put

278
00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:57.700
P14: it's

279
00:25:58.070 --> 00:26:09.810
P14: and I don't even know what the postal code is for. That's the other thing it's required. But and you know, so you're making me do the work. And I just gave you a whole bunch of privacy information about us. So that's not.

280
00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:18.059
P14: It's a simple usability thing. That's why. And people and companies that make money like best buy and target and everything. They're always saying.

281
00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.029
P14: What's what store would you like to go to.

282
00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:24.859
P14: you know? Very easy for them. So it's technically feasible.

283
00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:28.698
P14: I don't know what the I don't know what the do. I have to do. The Zip code.

284
00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:33.389
Moderator: Yeah, how would you expect that to work? Just kind of try and

285
00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.389
Moderator: search and find his facility

286
00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:37.029
Moderator: as if you were doing this on your own again?

287
00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:40.150
P14: Right? So I would go. Walter Reed.

288
00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:42.480
P14: zip code

289
00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:54.510
P14: right and see if it came back. And that's kind of a pain. Okay, so here, 2, 0 8, 8, 9. And right, it's the

290
00:26:56.080 --> 00:27:09.459
P14: alright cool. Why did I have to do that work? And now I mean, look what you did. You already looked it up because you did a very simple select statement on those on, on the thing I entered here, when you could have just pulled it all up.

291
00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:18.020
P14: based on, you know, or even made it a pull down like, you know. Where? Where are you? Where are the places that you'd like to go 15 miles within

292
00:27:18.451 --> 00:27:20.889
P14: I mean, I know this gives the user more

293
00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:48.359
P14: more agency, if you will, but it also makes it harder because and a lot of people like my dad would be like, this is too hard. Forget it. I'm just gonna go to tricare and we can go to nighttime pediatrics, and you can get somebody that you know, or if I fall down, then I'll go to the hospital, and they'll tell me who my caregiver is, and you know. And so and I'm like, Okay, they won't they? I can guarantee you that an 80 year old man is not. Gonna and especially if he was a green beret is not. Gonna

294
00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:53.161
P14: look this all up. He's gonna just go. They'll take care of me, anyway, because I'm a veteran

295
00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:55.410
P14: and

296
00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:57.819
P14: the interface should, is easy to do.

297
00:27:57.930 --> 00:27:59.990
P14: Should I select one? Then.

298
00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:01.319
Moderator: Yeah. Go ahead.

299
00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:02.630
P14: Okay.

300
00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:06.880
P14: Yep.

301
00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:15.529
Moderator: Yeah, through your impressions and thoughts as you're going through this page, and then I'll pause you for one more question.

302
00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:25.894
P14: yeah, I mean, this is, this is fine, you know.

303
00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:35.150
P14: again, it's like the onus is on you, right? So that's fine. But you know this is the facility you told us, instead of saying we'd like to confirm

304
00:28:35.479 --> 00:28:39.889
P14: and I know if you did A B testing, it would be different. But it, you know.

305
00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:46.363
P14: it's just a little the language, you know. So we'd like to confirm what you just said. Do you think this is where you're going.

306
00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:47.770
P14: and then

307
00:28:49.600 --> 00:29:05.769
P14: and maybe why, this is different, right? This is different from the one where he's going to get treatment. And you can just say, you know, even though yours, if if it's the same, don't do anything. But again, you could do a check

308
00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:16.319
P14: technically of the 2. But if it's different, you can explain to the caregiver so that they're not confused why, this is different than the place that they're going, and it's just to help.

309
00:29:16.787 --> 00:29:23.039
P14: It's just because that's probably the closest place that people can help you with the application, right?

310
00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:32.989
P14: Because there's nobody at Fort Belvoir. So there's probably somebody here that can help you with the application and also knows the program because they have a caregiver support coordinator.

311
00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:34.750
P14: But any

312
00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:38.709
P14: an average user would probably say, Why are they different?

313
00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:42.239
P14: Because they might not read this little paragraph here.

314
00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:47.069
P14: and that was my 1st thought is that they're different. What does that mean, and then I had to reread it and.

315
00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:54.789
Moderator: Got it. Thank you for talking through that. Is it clear? If you wanted to change the facility you selected.

316
00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:58.160
Moderator: Can you walk me through? How you would do that?

317
00:29:58.790 --> 00:30:09.159
P14: It's that's a great question. It's not clear, you know, that you can say, is this, is this correct? Right? So this is, that would be, why, you would have a confirmation instead of saying, This is the facility where you told us is like

318
00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:14.550
P14: this is what you know. What would a better way to say?

319
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:27.129
P14: just confirming that this is the one that you you know that you want? If if so, let's continue. If not, you know. You can always go back, you know, back, button up here rather than down here.

320
00:30:27.686 --> 00:30:30.539
P14: You know. Go back and change it, cause

321
00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:32.660
P14: undo is like one of the

322
00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:34.920
P14: one of the

323
00:30:36.410 --> 00:30:38.070
P14: easiest but

324
00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:39.630
P14: most important

325
00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:54.437
P14: design features you should have, because human beings are always wanting either comp to confirm what they did because they made a mistake, or they want to go back. Because they made a mistake. So yeah, I it wasn't clear right? So that I could go back.

326
00:30:54.740 --> 00:31:02.359
P14: I mean I probably would. I would go. Oh, no, that's not the one or my dad would go. That's are you crazy. That's not the one we're going to, and so I'd have to go back and do this

327
00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:03.830
P14: all over again.

328
00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:09.699
P14: So the good thing is that it remembered. I don't have to like refill it in right?

329
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:13.220
P14: I don't know. Maybe if I put something

330
00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:15.860
P14: different, would it?

331
00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:17.630
P14: That's not? Gonna

332
00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:20.460
P14: oh, okay, so I could do something different.

333
00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:23.399
P14: Let's see what happens when I

334
00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:26.420
P14: yeah, see, there's a different one again.

335
00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:33.430
P14: so. But they're both Va Medical Center. So why is this is as my kids would used to say.

336
00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:37.649
P14: And so there should be an explanation that says

337
00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:46.660
P14: more than this, you know that, so that somehow that makes you expect. Well, I guess this is fine, but I know that my dad wouldn't read this.

338
00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:47.550
P14: I know

339
00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:54.239
P14: could say they're different, because, you know, if if you see they're different, it's because one place has a character support.

340
00:31:56.550 --> 00:32:02.589
Moderator: Thanks for all that great feedback on that facilities piece on the before we kind of go on to the primary caregiver.

341
00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:03.090
P14: Okay.

342
00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:08.949
Moderator: Gonna ask you another rating question. Same scale, one to 5, 1 being very poor, 5 being very well.

343
00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:13.529
Moderator: how would you rate this facility, selection process

344
00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:16.220
Moderator: from the search to this page. Here.

345
00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:21.499
P14: I would probably do neutral. I mean it has all the information

346
00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:24.630
P14: there which is great. But it

347
00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:26.389
P14: but it

348
00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:31.139
P14: in terms of usability. There are little features that you could do that are better like the

349
00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:38.059
P14: like, the pull down saying, based on the information based on where you live and where the where your veteran lives.

350
00:32:38.602 --> 00:32:51.709
P14: This is what we, you know. We, we think, you know, are the ones that you might be close to correct or not, or here, pull, you know. Use this to search for a whole list of the facilities that would be

351
00:32:52.220 --> 00:33:00.980
P14: more usable. So I would say, this is neutral, like I said, it has all the information that I need. I did take a moment to read it and go. Okay. Now it makes more sense.

352
00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:06.709
P14: but I was annoyed that I had to go off off Page to find them

353
00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:12.756
P14: stupid zip code for the for the Va. Place that I know that I drive my dad to all the time.

354
00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:16.420
P14: and so cause you don't remember those things. And so.

355
00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:20.269
P14: rather than you telling me. Oh, based on your Zip code.

356
00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:32.169
P14: where where your veteran lives. Here are the places that we think you're what you drive to all the time. Or if none of those are the places that you go. Here's a list of all of them that you can select from

357
00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:37.790
P14: that have the Zip code, because it's in our database. We're not gonna let you play guessing games.

358
00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:39.290
P14: So yeah.

359
00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:43.460
P14: But again, like I said it, it has all the information here.

360
00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:49.269
Moderator: Awesome we can continue on. I'll quit pestering about this question.

361
00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:49.780
P14: Thank you.

362
00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:51.300
Moderator: For all that great feedback.

363
00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:56.314
P14: One thing I am worried about is, we are taking a lot of time, and I do have to leave at like 3, 35. But anyway.

364
00:33:56.700 --> 00:34:09.149
P14: so let's see, it's probably because I'm talking too much. So this is nice, right knowing about who qualifies. So this is a good thing to have like as a as a as a accordion. Open.

365
00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:11.120
P14: Let's see.

366
00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:13.960
Moderator: Can you tell me what a primary caregiver means to you.

367
00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:15.540
P14: I mean

368
00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:21.294
P14: I would. I would say that that's a good

369
00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:37.099
P14: modifier, a good descriptor for primary caregivers. I would say things like, I'm a primary caregiver for my dad. When I have to talk on the phone with people, and then they would ask me if they could talk to him to make sure for security reasons. Right?

370
00:34:37.739 --> 00:34:39.150
P14: For my mom.

371
00:34:39.702 --> 00:34:47.449
P14: So yeah, I think it makes sense. A primary caregiver is. It's for me. It wasn't that I had an official designator.

372
00:34:47.896 --> 00:34:51.630
P14: Which is what it looks like. This is a primary caregiver is somebody who

373
00:34:52.032 --> 00:34:55.577
P14: is. The major advocate is the person that drives them to

374
00:34:55.940 --> 00:35:02.386
P14: to appointments is the person that makes sure that they go to their physical therapy, or the physical therapist comes to them.

375
00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:10.760
P14: I didn't know until I just read that it's a designated and approved by Va. What I was always told

376
00:35:11.292 --> 00:35:32.467
P14: was that the the primary. If you really want to be primary, then you have to have like a you sign the health release form right? So that so that my dad says yes, she's authorized to be my representative, and even a power of attorney. That's what I ended up having to do, and putting that with their with all their profile information in there. My chart?

377
00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:35.516
P14: you know, in their digital

378
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:39.550
P14: their digital medical record stuff.

379
00:35:40.228 --> 00:35:43.509
P14: I didn't know it was design. It was designated by Va.

380
00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:48.519
P14: That might be how they found me actually, when they when my dad was sick.

381
00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:53.219
P14: I didn't know about the secondary.

382
00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:54.860
P14: That's interesting.

383
00:35:56.542 --> 00:36:05.810
P14: Is secondary. Then, like a physical therapist, to provide personal care, services or occupational therapists, is that is that what is that?

384
00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:08.419
Moderator: Is that how you're taking, how it's explaining it? Here.

385
00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:12.470
P14: Well, it looks like it, because it's a secondary family carers to provide

386
00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:15.760
P14: personal care services. I mean.

387
00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:22.530
P14: I guess it could be, you know, like another

388
00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:24.080
P14: family member.

389
00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:28.550
P14: like it says there, under relative

390
00:36:29.272 --> 00:36:37.010
P14: I guess, to drive people places. But also when you talk, when you're sitting in the hospital or the clinic, and talking to it.

391
00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:39.559
P14: general, like a

392
00:36:39.790 --> 00:36:42.300
P14: like a primary physician. Right? You're

393
00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:46.131
P14: or your regular physician, you

394
00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:51.509
P14: somebody saying personal care would be like an occupational therapist who would come and help give somebody a bath.

395
00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:59.429
P14: so not just somebody who, like drives them around to their appointments, which is what this kind of

396
00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:04.880
P14: yeah, the secondary doesn't have any meaning to me.

397
00:37:05.330 --> 00:37:13.197
P14: I I mean, I guess it does, because one is a designated official, and the other is sort of like people that just help in the network in the village.

398
00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:25.480
P14: But just this part personal care services made me think of like an occupational therapist or physical therapist, or a nurse that does blood pressure, or does an insulin thing, you know, measurement or something like that.

399
00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:28.230
P14: So I'll just say, yes.

400
00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:34.610
Moderator: Yeah, just go through the form and add yourself, like you were applying for a primary feel free to use fake information

401
00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:36.690
Moderator: whenever you feel comfortable.

402
00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:37.560
Moderator: Fine.

403
00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:46.380
P14: And then

404
00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:54.420
P14: that was fine. That was just standard.

405
00:37:54.850 --> 00:37:57.730
P14: Let your put your stuff in there. Yeah, I don't know.

406
00:37:57.730 --> 00:38:00.090
Moderator: Fake one here if you want.

407
00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:07.969
P14: Yeah. And I don't know. So why do you need the primary caregivers identification? Because this is a usually a privacy act.

408
00:38:09.310 --> 00:38:10.340
P14: request.

409
00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:12.079
Moderator: Yeah, can you

410
00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:17.529
Moderator: explain to me more? Just kind of what you're thinking and your background around that.

411
00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:19.310
P14: I I mean I

412
00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:28.980
P14: when I when I'm applied to be like a representative and a primary care, or somebody who

413
00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:31.230
P14: the form would be released to.

414
00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:36.510
P14: you know, or or any medical information would be released to in my father's record. I just brought like

415
00:38:36.540 --> 00:39:05.590
P14: the there's a hospital form. It's like a hipaa related form. You know. I I designated this person to be my representative. And you can share information with her, and her relationship is her daughter. I never had to put my social security number and then the other thing was a power of attorney. There's not a social security number in a power of attorney. It's like, you know, notarized by a lawyer that I'm who I say I am, and there's all my points of contact. But there's never a requirement for

416
00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:14.520
P14: social security number. And the more databases that have your social security number, you know, the more there's potential of

417
00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:25.730
P14: an issue number one and number 2. Usually when you ask for somebody's social security number, you put the 1974 privacy action. But that's

418
00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:32.720
P14: you know most people would just do it would just probably put their social security number in. I'm just telling you that because I know that that's a way to.

419
00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:34.700
P14: I don't see why there's

420
00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:36.550
P14: you ask you.

421
00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:45.719
P14: The interface gave me information about why why, you needed the county that the veteran lived in, but there's no information.

422
00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:48.649
P14: you know. Oh, I guess it's it does say, here, you know.

423
00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:49.940
P14: we'll need.

424
00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:53.939
P14: Oh, this is okay. So it says, we recommend providing it's not required.

425
00:39:55.900 --> 00:40:00.345
P14: But I guess the yeah. So so benefits make sense.

426
00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:03.950
P14: that makes sense.

427
00:40:05.330 --> 00:40:09.569
P14: But you have to read it right, and I choose not to. Is that okay?

428
00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:11.470
Moderator: Yup, of course. Thanks.

429
00:40:13.321 --> 00:40:16.149
P14: So yeah, use the same address.

430
00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:20.589
P14: Or I could. Okay, that makes sense. Just gonna

431
00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:25.230
P14: it's not the same. But that's good enough for the purposes of this.

432
00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:37.279
P14: and I would have done it this way. Just the mailing address the same, so that my, because my parents would want to see the mail right that I get for it.

433
00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:39.839
P14: And then I change it as needed.

434
00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:42.760
P14: because I would be visiting them to help them anyway.

435
00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:46.113
P14: So he'd be like, what are you getting for? Helping me out?

436
00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:52.850
P14: And I'd say, Here's the mail. It has my name on it, or he'd go. Why did I get a letter to you, and so

437
00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:58.370
P14: but I could put my stuff. It's just easier for our purposes right now.

438
00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:07.899
P14: and that and that was all fine. I mean it. These fields are pretty standard. The only one is, if, like I have to look up stuff for for the Va. When

439
00:41:07.930 --> 00:41:11.100
P14: it's easy for the Va. To provide that information

440
00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:12.490
P14: because of the

441
00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:19.390
P14: databases that you have, I know under the hood. That's that's the problem I would have.

442
00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:25.348
P14: And maybe here when I was giving you all the complaints

443
00:41:26.090 --> 00:41:48.700
P14: social security. Maybe that would be bigger, you know. Why do we cause it'd be something like primary caregivers identification? You know, you could say in bigger letters, why do we ask for this? And it's like, so you can get money for helping your because you're doing a lot of work, you can get benefits for helping your. You know your spouse friend.

444
00:41:48.930 --> 00:41:51.749
P14: father, rather than having it in this

445
00:41:51.890 --> 00:41:53.549
P14: in this font right

446
00:41:54.210 --> 00:41:56.220
P14: here? Because because

447
00:41:56.240 --> 00:42:08.159
P14: it's almost always good to cause you have the same thing in your why do we ask you for the county? It could be here. Why do we ask you for this, and then and then cause then somebody my! I would have read it 1st and stopped complaining.

448
00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:10.340
P14: Thank you for that.

449
00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:10.960
Moderator: Feedback.

450
00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:11.890
P14: If you can.

451
00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:14.469
P14: So let's see

452
00:42:14.992 --> 00:42:16.989
P14: yeah. So I'm just gonna put

453
00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:19.290
P14: Demisto.

454
00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:22.290
P14: Oh.

455
00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:28.030
P14: and then

456
00:42:29.250 --> 00:42:30.530
P14: I'll just pick.

457
00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:33.999
P14: This isn't correct, either. But

458
00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:41.790
P14: it's all pretty standard. Let's see, what is this? Yeah, okay, it's good.

459
00:42:43.090 --> 00:42:46.829
Moderator: I'll pause here, and just kind of want to ask what a secondary caregiver means.

460
00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:47.600
P14: Yeah, here we go.

461
00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:49.339
Moderator: Now that you see this page.

462
00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:50.570
P14: Yeah.

463
00:42:51.103 --> 00:42:53.019
P14: so this is a better

464
00:42:53.650 --> 00:43:02.999
P14: background. And I see why you probably did it as just personal care services before. I think you were trying to be shorter, right? So that people don't have to read

465
00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:04.500
P14: a wall of text.

466
00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:11.420
P14: but maybe even not even say anything about a secondary until you come here.

467
00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:17.370
P14: Right? Because because the primaries cares about the primary because they're officially designated.

468
00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:19.449
P14: So when you were back here.

469
00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:20.770
P14: see?

470
00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:28.980
P14: Yeah, I don't know why.

471
00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:44.574
P14: you might even just say, you know, family caregivers are approved and designated by V as primary care, because this one is almost like you're approved, and you have the seal of approval, and then you can say something like

472
00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:50.079
P14: We'll get to secondary caregivers. I don't even know that you need to say that until we get to the

473
00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:52.319
P14: until we get to

474
00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:56.750
P14: here, here, cause there's only gonna be one person, probably

475
00:43:57.118 --> 00:44:05.759
P14: that's filling this out. And so they're going to be focused on them being the primary caregiver. That's what I was always focused on, and then I might go. Oh, wait!

476
00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:08.220
P14: Oh, this is good. Now I can put my brother in here

477
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:13.930
P14: right, and so cause there's a backup. Oh, great! That's what I would cause. I wouldn't be thinking about

478
00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:16.359
P14: my brother until

479
00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:19.094
P14: until I got to here.

480
00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:21.280
P14: I don't know.

481
00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:27.369
Moderator: That's really great helpful feedback. I'm gonna select. No, just because I know we're coming up tight on time.

482
00:44:27.370 --> 00:44:28.240
P14: Time. Yep.

483
00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:32.789
Moderator: But I'm curious if you were completing this form for real, and we're applying with the secondary.

484
00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:35.970
P14: Yes, I'm just looking to see. Okay, yeah, that makes sense. It's all.

485
00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:36.879
Moderator: The same stuff.

486
00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:38.760
P14: Okay, go ahead.

487
00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:45.079
Moderator: So I guess. How would you coordinate if getting that information, if, like you had mentioned it was your brother that was applying for a secondary.

488
00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:50.899
P14: Well, if it was somebody close to me, right? It would. I would already have that information, probably

489
00:44:52.201 --> 00:45:01.379
P14: or I would. I mean. I think most families will talk about that, because the information that you would give are addresses and information that you probably would already have.

490
00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:12.580
P14: You're they're probably already sharing, going to going to the hospital, or something like that. They might even be emergency con, you know, secondary emergency contacts on something. So I don't think

491
00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:19.550
P14: you have to worry too much about getting that approval, because yes, my assumption would be, the family has already talked to

492
00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:29.301
P14: somebody about doing it like, if my mom was doing it, for example, she would go. She would call me and say, Can I put your information in here? And I'd go. Yeah, you want me to come over and help you.

493
00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:32.699
P14: And so, and she'd be like, Yeah.

494
00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:34.979
P14: you know, so that I don't think

495
00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:41.059
P14: I don't think that this, that that's a concern, because everything that you ask for here

496
00:45:41.810 --> 00:45:43.130
P14: is the same

497
00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:49.150
P14: right? What? Their what is their date of birth? What are they like, what's their relationship? Are they a friend? Are they a spouse?

498
00:45:49.797 --> 00:45:53.299
P14: So it's not like. And I didn't see

499
00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:58.490
P14: any requirement for a social security number. So I'm pretty sure that that would be.

500
00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:04.179
P14: Yeah. I don't think there's you don't have to worry about that.

501
00:46:05.170 --> 00:46:14.659
Moderator: But thanks for all that feedback, and you kind of answer this, but you wouldn't necessarily have to sit down and complete the form together, because you mentioned kind of coordinating it all beforehand.

502
00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:16.490
P14: With the secondary caregiver.

503
00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:17.270
Moderator: Yeah.

504
00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:19.860
P14: Yeah, I don't think so. I mean.

505
00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:22.460
P14: if somebody came in cold

506
00:46:22.810 --> 00:46:36.720
P14: and saw that they might leave it blank and then say, can I fill it out later? Which I think always should be, you know. Can I edit because times change right? Maybe I get hit by a bus, and my brother's the

507
00:46:36.730 --> 00:46:42.103
P14: one that takes over then he should be able to go in here and change things.

508
00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:54.899
P14: so I think if somebody didn't have a secondary caregiver, they would skip it just like we just did, and if they did, they would be close enough to that person that they would have that information about that person

509
00:46:55.370 --> 00:47:02.010
P14: pretty much at their fingertips. Maybe, with the exception of the birthday. If it's just like a neighbor, something like that.

510
00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:11.900
P14: Does that make sense? So then they might call their neighbor and say, Hey, can. I'm asking you because I want to get you a gift, and I'm filling out this form.

511
00:47:13.070 --> 00:47:13.980
P14: or whatever.

512
00:47:14.930 --> 00:47:24.189
Moderator: That's great feedback. Thank you for all of that. So yeah, if you could continue on, and just in your own words, describe what this page is asking you to do, and what it means.

513
00:47:26.725 --> 00:47:31.459
P14: This is pretty standard for somebody who's been a caregiver for somebody. Right? If you're the

514
00:47:31.967 --> 00:47:42.029
P14: if you're the representative, say what you're doing right. Cause that happens with voting with other health forms and things like that. And then.

515
00:47:45.890 --> 00:47:52.250
P14: yeah, so see, this is the valid power of attorney, leader gardening. These are all things that I would have already had.

516
00:47:52.892 --> 00:47:54.489
P14: It might be

517
00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:03.169
P14: yeah. And if I if I had been any of these things, I would know what these forms are, I hope.

518
00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:12.919
P14: or I would copy this and search in Google and find out what that form is to make sure that I had. I had the right form.

519
00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:18.600
P14: I don't know if a person who's less comfortable with the web would do that, but that's what I would do.

520
00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:30.779
P14: The one thing that I think you should put is that when we started this whole application you didn't ask me you didn't say, have you said, have your social security number ready, or have the social security of the veteran?

521
00:48:31.192 --> 00:48:33.370
P14: The place where they usually go?

522
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:39.348
P14: You didn't say the Zip code of the place that they usually go and the

523
00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:47.059
P14: and I think one other one or 2 other things which are pretty that I would have had available anyway. But I wouldn't always have my power of attorney

524
00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:50.175
P14: cause I would just go through this whole thing and go. Are you kidding me?

525
00:48:51.496 --> 00:48:54.060
P14: I have to go get the power of attorney now.

526
00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:57.020
P14: Yeah. So

527
00:48:57.620 --> 00:49:00.900
P14: so this should be told upfront that you should, you know.

528
00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:05.179
P14: cause this is another. We can't accept this because people will have a driver's license.

529
00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:11.490
P14: or even yeah. The release of information might be in like my my chart

530
00:49:12.490 --> 00:49:13.940
P14: medical profile.

531
00:49:14.010 --> 00:49:22.139
P14: But see uploading a document that we can't accept will delay the application process. Well, then, why did I spend 15 min, and I didn't know at the very beginning that you gave me.

532
00:49:23.130 --> 00:49:24.439
P14: Does that make sense.

533
00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:31.290
Moderator: Yeah, that's great feedback. Thank you. And we're coming up close on time. So are you a legal representative?

534
00:49:31.350 --> 00:49:35.339
Moderator: If you were filling this out. Would you be signing as a representative.

535
00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:39.039
P14: Yes, because I I if if.

536
00:49:39.210 --> 00:49:51.350
P14: while my parents were alive, I was their power of attorney. After a certain age, I became so when they were like in their sixties or seventies. I think I became part of the release in case I had to go help them

537
00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:54.429
P14: with something. When I was stationed

538
00:49:54.540 --> 00:50:00.689
P14: close to them when I wasn't stationed close to them. Of course. You know they they had each other as the emergency contacts.

539
00:50:01.314 --> 00:50:03.249
P14: But once they were

540
00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:09.540
P14: needed help more driving. We talked about, and they like fell.

541
00:50:09.570 --> 00:50:16.549
P14: I became the power of attorney, and my brother was also. He was like a secondary power of attorney in the case that I wasn't

542
00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:25.099
P14: you know I was incapacitated. So yes, that's what I would. That's the exact way. If my parents were still alive I would be signing.

543
00:50:25.930 --> 00:50:32.349
Moderator: Thanks for that feedback. Can you change your answer to the veteran signing just because it'll take you through the upload path, and

544
00:50:32.910 --> 00:50:38.629
Moderator: I want to get your feedback on this one last page because we're at time, and I know you said you had somewhere to go.

545
00:50:39.290 --> 00:50:43.120
Moderator: So kind of can you talk through this page for me, please, and

546
00:50:44.350 --> 00:50:48.410
Moderator: just let me know your initial impressions and expectations of it.

547
00:50:49.775 --> 00:50:56.830
P14: I think I might put this. Please review the information up at the top, because I could play around with these people will expand them and go, what is this?

548
00:50:57.238 --> 00:50:59.570
P14: But I wouldn't have you know.

549
00:51:00.110 --> 00:51:05.410
P14: And and when, as soon as I saw my dad's information, I was like, great, yeah, okay, yeah. And then I would check it for.

550
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.250
P14: But it might just be better right under the thing, and then

551
00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:15.720
P14: yep.

552
00:51:17.970 --> 00:51:19.339
Moderator: Yeah. And I guess if you saw something

553
00:51:19.810 --> 00:51:20.500
Moderator: by mistake.

554
00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:23.670
P14: Oh, good question.

555
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:27.849
P14: I'm I got. I would edit it

556
00:51:28.070 --> 00:51:28.760
P14: right.

557
00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:33.579
P14: And I do like that

558
00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:35.419
P14: up the simple update.

559
00:51:36.690 --> 00:51:38.179
P14: So that's nice.

560
00:51:39.010 --> 00:51:40.650
P14: because then I don't have to.

561
00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:43.280
P14: Yeah.

562
00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:46.080
P14: I think some people, yeah.

563
00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:51.090
P14: maybe it should say, save, I don't know, save that information instead of update the page.

564
00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:53.229
P14: That's the only

565
00:51:54.430 --> 00:51:57.980
P14: thing that I would, in terms of this modal button.

566
00:51:59.810 --> 00:52:01.620
Moderator: That's great feedback. Thank you.

567
00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:09.870
Moderator: And then, as you scroll down here, what is your comfort level for filling out and signing this information.

568
00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:13.910
Moderator: if there was a secondary caregiver involved as well.

569
00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:16.872
P14: I mean, I might

570
00:52:17.830 --> 00:52:23.588
P14: just want something. Yes, it says, I read it. I've read, except the pro. Yeah. So since there's a privacy policy here.

571
00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:26.955
P14: then I would, you know. Just wanna make sure that

572
00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:30.799
P14: I'm whatever I'm signing is, you know, protected

573
00:52:33.350 --> 00:52:34.310
P14: But I

574
00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:38.766
P14: I feel pretty comfortable. I think a lot of people just don't even read it

575
00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:42.102
P14: just like everything else, like when you but

576
00:52:42.570 --> 00:52:44.229
P14: and I would just skim

577
00:52:44.992 --> 00:52:52.909
P14: skim this because it does look pretty. Standard and I would be more interested in, you know, making sure that it said something about the privacy policy.

578
00:52:53.420 --> 00:53:02.040
P14: so that you know, because you're always afraid your information when you're submitting it online, where does it really go? And do people really care about keeping it safe.

579
00:53:04.170 --> 00:53:08.180
P14: especially if you're gonna tell me that if I send you something wrong you could be

580
00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:10.910
P14: go go to jail, and and I don't get any.

581
00:53:11.478 --> 00:53:14.961
P14: I would like to get acknowledgement from you that it would be private, too.

582
00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:16.420
P14: So

583
00:53:16.610 --> 00:53:18.369
P14: it's kind of a transactional

584
00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:20.460
P14: Kadia.

585
00:53:21.970 --> 00:53:23.809
Moderator: That's great feedback. Thank you.

586
00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:29.500
Moderator: And you won't be able to submit since we're in our testing site. But we are 2 min over. So

587
00:53:29.730 --> 00:53:32.870
Moderator: I wanna be respectful. You said you had a hard stop. Correct.

588
00:53:32.870 --> 00:53:36.180
P14: Yeah, and about yeah, and about 3, yeah, and about

589
00:53:36.410 --> 00:53:39.100
P14: 3 min. Sorry.

590
00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:43.810
P14: You probably need to do a focus group question, right? Or an interview. Do you need to do post interview.

591
00:53:44.070 --> 00:53:47.900
Moderator: We just had a couple questions that I could kind of go through real quick.

592
00:53:48.170 --> 00:53:51.110
P14: Can I? You want me to exit out of it and stop sharing.

593
00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:51.830
P14: Yeah.

594
00:53:51.830 --> 00:53:55.339
Moderator: If you want, that's fine, you can keep it up if it helps.

595
00:53:55.867 --> 00:53:58.000
P14: It might help. So let me just make sure

596
00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:02.910
P14: cause you might ask me a question about looking at the interface again. Yeah.

597
00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:10.739
Moderator: Yeah, I guess I was just curious of what your thoughts were, of the amount of information provided in the form you gave some really good feedback and examples. But

598
00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:14.990
Moderator: do you think it was too much information just enough, or too little.

599
00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:24.379
P14: I mean, I think the information for the if a caregiver is applying.

600
00:54:24.490 --> 00:54:27.429
P14: if that's the level of information that's needed.

601
00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:32.370
P14: just to fill out the form. I think it's probably

602
00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:34.040
P14: about right

603
00:54:34.787 --> 00:54:38.609
P14: cause. I would expect to send my information.

604
00:54:39.023 --> 00:54:46.240
P14: What? My relationship to my parent in the the Va. The veteran would be so in terms of like just the

605
00:54:46.420 --> 00:54:50.880
P14: logistics or the mechanics of it of or not mechanics. The

606
00:54:50.990 --> 00:54:52.140
P14: content

607
00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:57.350
P14: that I needed to fill out. I think it's about right cause. I would expect that I would have to

608
00:54:58.700 --> 00:55:04.460
P14: give all that information so that I could get a response back from the Va. And they could evaluate whether I'm

609
00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:09.500
P14: you know, a good caregiver or qualify, or whether I qualify

610
00:55:09.530 --> 00:55:11.730
P14: number one. The main

611
00:55:12.430 --> 00:55:16.610
P14: issues that I had, as you heard, were the usability.

612
00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:23.219
P14: Yeah, so yeah, I think it's about right. What I would expect. I can't think of any

613
00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:39.539
P14: other information. And I've always been asked, you know, when they when I'm in, almost at the beginning of a conversation, why are you calling for this older person? Are you trying to, you know, manipulate them or something, and then, when they get the power of attorney, and for good reason, but then, when they get the power of attorney and all the other stuff there.

614
00:55:39.630 --> 00:55:41.869
P14: like, oh, yeah, she is a, you know.

615
00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:43.470
P14: infected.

616
00:55:43.550 --> 00:55:45.140
P14: good representative

617
00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:47.060
P14: of this older person.

618
00:55:49.770 --> 00:55:57.779
Moderator: Thank you so much for all of that really, really great feedback. It's really helpful to us. And before we jump off I just want to circle back and reconfirm.

619
00:55:57.890 --> 00:56:05.049
Moderator: Are you comfortable? If we decided to share a video clip of the session with our Va. Partners with removing any identifiable information.

620
00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:07.020
P14: Yeah, as long as

621
00:56:07.930 --> 00:56:13.589
P14: I'm I'm a yeah, I'm a researcher. It does human computer interaction. So I probably have a lot of

622
00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:18.749
P14: negative things to say. I mean, it's it's as a basic interface. It's it's pretty nice. It's clean.

623
00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:20.360
P14: But there's a lot of

624
00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:24.810
P14: things that you could think about that would help people go through it more quickly.

625
00:56:25.610 --> 00:56:36.919
Moderator: Yeah, thank you. Okay, well, we really appreciate you taking your time to share your thoughts with us today. And your feedback is super helpful as we continue to iterate and try and make the site better for veterans and caregivers.

626
00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:38.190
Moderator: And just so, you know.

627
00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:40.439
Moderator: Okay, thank you. Have a great day.

628
00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:42.499
P14: Oh, wait! What were you gonna say? Just so, you know.

629
00:56:42.500 --> 00:56:49.399
Moderator: I was just gonna say Perugian will be sending you a little. Thank you. Note. They're the ones that recruited you, and it'll kind of you can pass it along to other veterans as well.

630
00:56:50.030 --> 00:56:57.289
P14: Okay, great. And there's was there. I don't know. I can't remember if there is or not. Was there compensate compensation just out of curiosity or.

631
00:56:57.290 --> 00:57:02.109
Moderator: Period will be handling all of that through their Thank you. Email. So you should get all the details within.

632
00:57:02.110 --> 00:57:05.530
P14: Okay, thanks, thanks very much. And good luck.

633
00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:07.059
Moderator: Have a great day.

634
00:57:07.060 --> 00:57:07.600
P14: You too.

635
00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:07.860
Moderator: Cute.

636
00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:08.990
P14: Bye-bye, bye.

637
00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:09.540
Moderator: Bye.
