Moderator: You know of. No. Okay. Have you heard of that program before?

10
00:00:48.527 --> 00:00:53.990
P24: A little bit when I was doing research I went through, but I'm not real familiar with it, though.

11
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.239
Moderator: Okay, have you ever interacted with the Va. For other family member benefits.

12
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.790
P24: The only the only thing that I did was put in for a form for spousal.

13
00:01:11.145 --> 00:01:12.290
P24: Stipend

14
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.219
P24: that that was it.

15
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.940
P24: My, my kids are all older.

16
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.709
Moderator: Gotcha. Okay?

17
00:01:20.334 --> 00:01:26.820
Moderator: So could you explain to you and to me in your own words what you think it means to have a caregiver.

18
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.510
P24: Well, it's it's gonna be somebody that helps you with your day to day process.

19
00:01:34.103 --> 00:01:38.500
P24: My wife does that. Now I there's no way that I could handle my medications.

20
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:39.170
Moderator: Okay.

21
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:48.148
P24: I I thought I took them last night, and then she comes out of bedtime. Tells me I didn't take my medication, so I mean stuff like that.

22
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.800
P24: driving.

23
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.539
P24: I will drive myself to short distances. But I don't drive any distance anymore, because I just don't trust myself.

24
00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:59.900
P24: Okay.

25
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.959
P24: It's just help with things. It isn't that it?

26
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.470
P24: I can't.

27
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.540
P24: I can't do things, but I can't do things well.

28
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:10.449
Moderator: Okay.

29
00:02:11.282 --> 00:02:22.590
Moderator: so what would be your preferred method to learn more about a caregiver program and benefits that your family members may qualify for how do you like to find that kind of information.

30
00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.219
P24: Well, I'm I'm 76. My my wife

31
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.469
P24: is getting of an age where it's hard for her to do things too.

32
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:31.450
Moderator: Okay.

33
00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:32.844
P24: So I mean,

34
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:41.739
P24: the kids are good about things if we need some. But I mean they're just not here every day, and we wouldn't want to burden them with that, anyway.

35
00:02:44.115 --> 00:02:49.309
P24: I don't think it's anything, Major. I my granddaughter's over here today.

36
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.220
P24: She's she's she's 1. She had ear tubes put in, so

37
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.110
P24: we were dealt. We were delegated to

38
00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.940
P24: caregiver for her today.

39
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:00.550
Moderator: Oh!

40
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.112
Moderator: Oh, that sounds fun!

41
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.180
P24: Well, sometimes.

42
00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.303
Moderator: Yes, exactly.

43
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.809
P24: They tire out even when they're good.

44
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.720
Moderator: Yeah, that's true.

45
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.949
P24: What's see grading?

46
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.549
P24: She's my scorchy papa, of course.

47
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.040
P24: Oh, yeah.

48
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:34.760
Moderator: So if you were going to complete a form to apply for caregiver benefits like the one we are going to go through together today. What information do you think you would want before completing a form like that?

49
00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.150
P24: Well.

50
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.020
P24: I'm sure there's limits and guidelines to everything. I'd have to know what the guidelines were. The requirements.

51
00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.850
P24: Right right now. I read it at 90%

52
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.619
P24: disability. And I have memory and concentration issues.

53
00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.206
P24: So I've

54
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.840
P24: I don't know. I do things twice sometimes. I don't do them at all. So

55
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.110
P24: it's basically just guidance. It isn't that I

56
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.409
P24: I could dress myself and

57
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.949
P24: pay myself and

58
00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.549
P24: meals. Almost meals are all quick fix. We go out and buy. You know. We go somewhere.

59
00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.979
P24: So I don't really anybody to prep meals. But just to

60
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.720
P24: day to day, make sure the day to day things are done and

61
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.699
P24: follow up I put. I put everything into a calendar.

62
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.270
P24: It's like your meeting here. I put everything into a calendar, and then I have an alarm to me.

63
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.350
P24: otherwise I'd forget about it.

64
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.030
P24: So

65
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:45.899
P24: I have went through the

66
00:04:46.344 --> 00:04:50.600
P24: speech therapist they went through the memory thing, and it was

67
00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.319
P24: well they told me I was doing some of the stuff, but they told me a few other things that

68
00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:03.930
P24: wife and I coordinate so that we we write it down or put it in the phones. Everything's put in the calendar.

69
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:05.800
P24: If not.

70
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.110
P24: start up, there's no way I can manage it.

71
00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.000
Moderator: Gotcha.

72
00:05:11.208 --> 00:05:19.570
Moderator: Okay, so thank you so much for sharing that background. We're gonna change gears a bit now, and I'm going to share a link to the testing site.

73
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.690
Moderator: I'm going to put it in the Zoom chat and let me know if you need any help finding that.

81
00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:39.870
Moderator: That's then there's a button that says Chat, and it should have like a little notification that I sent something in there.

82
00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:41.579
Moderator: That toolbar.

83

P24: Screen says, screen photos, icon drive website.

P24: I'm in a room in the house.

152
00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:53.140
Moderator: That's weird.

153
00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:54.350
P24: Okay.

154
00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.510

155
00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:00.849
P24: I had the page, but I can't. I can't get both of them on the screen.

156
00:12:07.453 --> 00:12:10.860
Moderator: What what did it say when you tried to share your screen?

157
00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:16.609
P24: It's a screen photos, Icloud drive website, U-URL.

158
00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.028
Moderator: And then when you select screen.

159
00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:26.159
P24: Right, and when I do that it comes up, everything on your screen, including notifications, will be recorded.

160
00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:29.640
P24: enable enable do not disturb, to

161
00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:36.869
P24: prevent unexpected notifications screen broadcast, and then it's got zoom with a check mark next to it.

162
00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.989
P24: and it says, Start broadcast.

163
00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:43.399
Moderator: Okay? And then what happens if you tap, start broadcast.

164
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:51.190
P24: It says, screen broadcast, not available airplay, carplay restrictions or screen monitoring is active.

165
00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:54.150
P24: I don't have any of that active. I know of.

166
00:12:55.361 --> 00:12:58.570
Moderator: It might be that you don't have your

167
00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:04.070
Moderator: settings so that zoom can access your screen.

168
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:10.240
Moderator: but it's weird that it's not just taking you there directly.

169
00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:16.589
Moderator: let's see.

170
00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:19.769

172
00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:25.930

173
00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:30.350
P24: Yep.

174
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:37.219
Moderator: So you want to go to the settings and then scroll all the way down to the zoom app.

175
00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:40.887
Moderator: which is, gonna be the last one.

192
00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:44.490
Moderator: Does it say camera.

193
00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:47.750
P24: And

P24: says background app refresh.

196
00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:58.670
P24: But it looks like that's from something else.

197
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:02.639
Moderator: Did does it have a camera option?

198

Moderator: thoughts and reactions to it. And

225
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:11.399

236
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:27.700
P24: I like to set up like a

237
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:29.140
P24: like an outline.

238
00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:31.660
P24: I'm not worried about full sentences.

239
00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:44.939

253
00:19:37.274 --> 00:19:39.209

275
00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:53.280
P24: I taught fire schools for a while for New York State Fire

276
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:54.630
P24: Fire Academy.

277
00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:58.389
P24: and when I would do my lesson plans I would always

278
00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:02.969
P24: but like bullet points

279
00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:07.289
P24: and the main stuff that I wanted, and if I needed.

280
00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:13.259
P24: if I had to expunge on it. I would use as few words as possible to explain what

281
00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:16.960
P24: I was talking about, so that you could get the point across, but not

282
00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.769
P24: overload it with it.

283
00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:23.970
P24: And

284
00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:28.170
P24: I'm sorry

285
00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:29.190

286
00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:31.140
Moderator: Okay.

287
00:21:32.046 --> 00:21:38.830
Moderator: with, like, you're saying you would put kind of like bullets and not overload with too much information.

288
00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:43.859
P24: Right? Like, I'm looking at right here as a bullet points the social security number

289
00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:49.049
P24: on a tax identification or tax identification. That's boom to the point.

290
00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.469
P24: That's what you need.

291
00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:51.480
Moderator: Okay.

292
00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:56.290

P24: Okay.

294
00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:02.351
P24: I would, I would assume with a caregiver there would be some kind of

295
00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:04.530
P24: means test

296
00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:08.609
P24: to see whether you even needed it.

297
00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:10.409
P24: And and

298
00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:15.232
P24: if there's some kind of criteria for whatever

299
00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:18.519
P24: the caregiver needs to meet

300
00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:20.879
P24: that standard, you know, just

301
00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:23.300
P24: explicit in general.

302
00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:24.780
P24: and.

303
00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:30.679
Moderator: Yeah, okay, thank you. That's really helpful.

355
00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:05.870

362
00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:27.550
P24: all this stuff here could be preloaded.

363
00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:32.140
P24: Because it's only it's unique to that number.

P24: for us. Address. Well, if you got a Zip code that's gonna give you the country.

372
00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:05.570

Moderator: Any thoughts about that.

379
00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:14.633

380
00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:17.359
P24: if you've got that

381

389
00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:47.850
P24: Drop down box

390
00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:57.430

P24: you know, Durham, North Carolina.

393

Moderator: Okay. Why would you select that one.

401
00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:29.589
P24: Cause. That's where I'm

402
00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:31.009
P24: out of.

403
00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:33.389
P24: That's the Va center that

Moderator: What would you do if you wanted to do a new search.

407
00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:50.539
P24: What would I do?

408
00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:56.460
Moderator: Yeah. How would you if you were like, oh, that's not right. I wanna start a totally new search.

409
00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:01.750
P24: Well.

410
00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:04.089
P24: the way that I've

411
00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:11.750
P24: I'm originally from upstate New York, and I lived in Georgia for a while before we moved here. So

412
00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:15.370
P24: I found everything from my healthy vet site

413
00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:17.912
P24: that was before they had the

414
00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:20.470
P24: the

415
00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:21.840
P24: PA app.

416
00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:25.300
P24: I went in. I went in and did a search in the.

417
00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:31.620
P24: you know, find my location. I think that was called I I can't remember what the name of it was, but

418
00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:35.090
P24: it was searching locations, and the locations were in there

419
00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:37.239
P24: within the dropbox.

420
00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:38.900
P24: I think.

421
00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:42.360
P24: Tell you truth, I think I searched it by Zip code number.

422
00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:43.710
Moderator: Okay.

423
00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:45.180
P24: I can't remember now.

424
00:30:50.226 --> 00:30:58.969
Moderator: On a scale of one to 5, 1 being the worst and 5 being the best. How would you rate this process of selecting a facility.

425
00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:02.860
P24: Well, if you've got this dropdown right. This is.

426
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:04.640
P24: this is a 5,

427
00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:07.910
P24: you know, if it drops down so you don't have to

428
00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:15.080
P24: see, I think right there. If I you had a Zip code and you dropped in there that would do the same thing.

429
00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:16.960
P24: These are all Durham.

430
00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:17.950
Moderator: Yeah.

431
00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:23.200
P24: They're just. They're just they're clinics, not the one is the Va. Son, and the other are clinics.

432
00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:26.090
Moderator: Okay?

433
00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:36.269
Moderator: And what does the term primary caregiver mean to you?

434
00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:40.209
P24: That would be the main person that

435
00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:43.150
P24: takes care of my day to daily issues.

436
00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:46.240
Moderator: Okay?

437
00:31:46.842 --> 00:31:52.499
Moderator: So I'm gonna go through a scenario. We are where we're adding a primary caregiver for you.

438
00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:54.490
P24: Okay.

439
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.379
Moderator: Just let me know any reactions that you're having about the questions and the

440
00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:01.489
Moderator: the form in general.

441
00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:12.680
P24: Now stole it.

442
00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:19.229
P24: The question I had when I want I wanted to get a stipend for my wife, for taking care of me.

443
00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:23.969
P24: I'm not looking to have somebody from outside come into the house.

444
00:32:24.890 --> 00:32:26.109
P24: or just did

445
00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:31.379
P24: I have to have somebody take care of it? If it's not her, it would have to be somebody.

446
00:32:32.290 --> 00:32:35.729
P24: But what I would be looking for is to get a stipend for her.

447
00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:37.225
P24: So

448
00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:41.440
P24: Whatever questions would be needed for that.

449
00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:44.289
P24: you know, think

450
00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:47.089
P24: she takes. She takes care of all the bills.

451
00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:49.129
P24: I you know I

452
00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:49.764
P24: I

453
00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:54.190
P24: I don't mess around with paying anything. And

454
00:32:56.530 --> 00:33:00.429
P24: the autos in my name, but everything else is pretty much in hers.

455
00:33:01.593 --> 00:33:08.109
P24: So and we've done that on purpose, just just because I I invert numbers. And I

456
00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:08.875
P24: I

457
00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:11.179
P24: It's hard for me to

458
00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:14.860
P24: to write anymore, because I leave words out, or I

459
00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:17.020
P24: I'll write something

460
00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:23.349
P24: gibberish down. It made sense when I wrote it down. But it does. That doesn't communicate anything.

461
00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:30.540
P24: So I mean, I need. I would need somebody to do the basic functions that you would need to do.

462
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:34.390
Moderator: Okay, gotcha

463
00:33:34.808 --> 00:33:40.480
Moderator: so to your knowledge, you're not enrolled in this program. And does she get a stipend from the Va.

464
00:33:41.891 --> 00:33:46.200
P24: Not for a caregiver. She gets it for a spouse because I'm over.

465
00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:53.359
P24: I think it's when you go over 30%. I mean. It's not much 50 bucks, I think, or 60, maybe.

466
00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:54.540
Moderator: Gotcha.

467
00:33:56.430 --> 00:34:08.601
Moderator: Okay, well, this is off topic sort of, but you may want to try applying for this. If you haven't before, just talk to your wife about it, because this program is the

468
00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:13.509
Moderator: is where you would apply for the caregiver to get benefits like a stipend

469
00:34:13.966 --> 00:34:18.549
Moderator: and they qualify. I'm not sure there's pretty complex eligibility, criteria

470
00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:26.710
Moderator: but in the zoom chat I sent you the link to the actual like live form. If you want to apply with your wife.

471
00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:27.949
P24: Okay.

472
00:34:29.752 --> 00:34:38.659
Moderator: I'll also have pair G, and email that to you. After the session, that is the company that sent you the invite for this session.

473
00:34:41.419 --> 00:34:43.769
Moderator: So going back to the form.

474
00:34:44.219 --> 00:34:48.859
Moderator: I'm just gonna keep going through. Let me know any reactions that you are having about it.

475
00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:55.329
P24: I like, drop down windows. Yeah.

476
00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:03.920
P24: excuse me.

477
00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:17.669
Moderator: How would you feel about putting your wife your wife's social security number, in in the form.

478
00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:22.590
P24: Well, it'd be almost necessary, wouldn't it? I think that I think

479
00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:24.153
P24: what that

480
00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:30.580
P24: I assume. What? That's some kind of means to us. You know what kind of

481
00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:37.570
P24: I'm off the means test now. But I when I 1st got my benefits.

482
00:35:37.690 --> 00:35:41.269
P24: I had to submit. You know how much money it made where?

483
00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:45.350
P24: I don't.

484
00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:50.230
P24: I don't know why that would be necessary. I mean, if I would think he just proves it.

485
00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:53.279
P24: I needed somebody and

486
00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:57.309
P24: Number 2 that she was capable of filling that position.

487
00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:00.470
P24: So you know I don't.

488
00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:01.970
P24: I don't know what the

489
00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:02.960
P24: good

490
00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:14.510
P24: the Federal law or the laws are on. I assume that they've got this form. There's got to be some kind of criteria behind it. It's just that that's not clear to see what that criteria is.

491
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:15.680
Moderator: Okay.

492
00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:23.100
Moderator: thank you. That's really helpful. So you would be comfortable putting her social security number in the form.

493
00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:25.160
P24: To the Va. Yes.

494
00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:33.980
Moderator: Okay? And would you need her to be like, how would you want to fill out this form? Would you want to fill it out with her. Would you want her to fill it out? Would you fill it out.

495
00:36:35.035 --> 00:36:36.090
P24: Would.

496
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.529
P24: I hadn't thought about that. But

497
00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:46.370
P24: are we?

498
00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:49.460
P24: I would think she'd have to fill it out or part of it.

499
00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:51.660
P24: just because.

500
00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:58.580
P24: you know, somebody could fill this out and not even tell them. And all of a sudden, you know you're my caregiver.

501
00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:00.490
P24: You know I didn't.

502
00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:07.409
P24: Nobody consulted me on it, or got my consent. I mean there, there would have to be some kind of

503
00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:09.959
P24: a consent, consent

504
00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:11.340
P24: and do it.

505
00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:12.870
Moderator: Okay.

506
00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:15.810
Moderator: thank you. That's helpful.

507
00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:19.730
P24: Either by signing the signing a physical form or

508
00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:22.630
P24: doing something something online. That

509
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:24.830
P24: ticket sign online.

510
00:37:26.090 --> 00:37:26.800
Moderator: Okay.

511
00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:31.500
Moderator: I'm just kidding

512
00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:32.880
Moderator: next.

513
00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:44.119
Moderator: any thoughts about this one.

514
00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:47.020
P24: Primary character really interesting.

515
00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:51.729
P24: Yeah, you would need that

516
00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:54.910
P24: if it's if it's not, you would need to address.

517
00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:56.670
P24: If

518
00:37:57.730 --> 00:38:03.890
P24: with with my wife, yes, would be here. But if somebody was care caregiver that was outside

519
00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:07.189
P24: my home you'd have to have their address, I would think.

520
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:09.749
P24: You know mailing address. You may not

521
00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:10.750
P24: need to

522
00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:13.530
P24: physical address, but you need

523
00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:16.319
P24: either way of contact them.

524
00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:17.830
Moderator: Okay.

525
00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:48.640
Moderator: what does a secondary caregiver mean to you?

526
00:38:53.930 --> 00:38:56.000
P24: For me. It might be one of the kids.

527
00:38:58.685 --> 00:39:00.109
P24: I don't know.

528
00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:02.460
P24: Secondary, just

529
00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:04.780
P24: be exactly what it is. If

530
00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:06.360
P24: Primary couldn't

531
00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:10.180
P24: do those duties somebody was appointed to do those.

532
00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:11.910
P24: or

533
00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:14.610
P24: requested to do that.

534
00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:17.700
Moderator: Okay. Have you heard of that term before.

535
00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:19.970
P24: Secondary.

536
00:39:20.602 --> 00:39:22.500
Moderator: Caregiver, secondary, caregiver.

537
00:39:23.005 --> 00:39:23.510
P24: No.

538
00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:24.730
P24: Okay.

539
00:39:25.544 --> 00:39:32.570
Moderator: How do you think that the secondary role would differ in the application process and the benefits from the primary caregiver.

540
00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:35.499
P24: There you go.

541
00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:39.520
P24: It sounds like they're gonna pay 2 people to do the same thing.

542
00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:41.789
P24: That's what it sounds like.

543
00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:43.080
Moderator: Okay.

544
00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:44.325
P24: But

545
00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:48.520
P24: Do you really think that's needed?

546
00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:50.950
P24: I mean, if it changes.

547
00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:56.669
P24: if it, if my wife can't do it, somebody else do it. Then I would resubmit.

548
00:39:57.050 --> 00:40:00.280
P24: Why? Why would it need a secondary.

549
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:02.700
Moderator: Okay.

550
00:40:02.890 --> 00:40:07.310
Moderator: So if you were filling this out, would you not add a secondary caregiver.

551
00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:10.360
P24: I probably wouldn't know.

552
00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:11.710
Moderator: Okay.

553
00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:15.100
Moderator: Gonna say no. Then.

554
00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:21.239
Moderator: great. Just take a look through this page and let me know what your thoughts are.

555
00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:43.380
P24: Well, it looks like if it was wasn't.

556
00:40:44.850 --> 00:40:49.729
P24: If I didn't sign on this it would have to be somebody with power of attorney. By the looks of it.

557
00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:54.120
P24: I think it was 3 of me.

558
00:40:57.230 --> 00:41:00.740
Moderator: Okay, do you have someone who is a legal representative for you?

559
00:41:01.855 --> 00:41:03.730
P24: Not at this time. No.

560
00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:05.746
P24: okay. I mean, I have.

561
00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:07.816
P24: You know I have.

562
00:41:12.777 --> 00:41:21.199
P24: I have to pay for work and base in case I become incapacitated, but other than that, no.

563
00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:25.579
Moderator: Okay. So what would you select here if you were filling out this form.

564
00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:33.100
P24: I am the veteran and signing for myself

565
00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:45.519
P24: I got a thing here on, says, learn more about the types of documents we can and can't accept.

566
00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:47.196
P24: I would.

567
00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:51.100
P24: oh, yeah.

568
00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:54.830
P24: that would definitely have to be in there.

569
00:41:57.700 --> 00:42:00.429
P24: you know, cause that could be the 1st question.

570
00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:07.230
Moderator: Your 1st question would be, what type of documents can they accept.

571
00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:08.799
P24: Yeah, well, you just

572
00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:12.110
P24: yeah.

573
00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:14.510
P24: You know power of attorney, or

574
00:42:15.358 --> 00:42:17.999
P24: they have legal guardian here.

575
00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:25.800
P24: Looks to me like everything. Yeah, you'd have to have that.

576
00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:35.269
Moderator: Okay. So now, seeing this, would you still select? I'm a veteran signing for myself.

577
00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:36.770
P24: Yes.

578
00:42:37.170 --> 00:42:37.780
Moderator: Okay.

579
00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:39.939
Moderator: gonna go forward

580
00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:50.720
Moderator: alright. So just want you to tell me what you think about this page. What do you think it is asking, and what does it mean to you.

581
00:42:53.780 --> 00:43:00.359
P24: I think what this is doing. This is, this is you're going in and look and see what you input it.

582
00:43:01.328 --> 00:43:04.200
P24: When you hit the plus. It's just gonna

583
00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:06.460
P24: expand the

584
00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:09.399
P24: veterans information that you put in there.

585
00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:10.830
P24: Then,

586
00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:13.240
P24: when you collapse it.

587
00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:15.670
P24: you can go to the next if you can.

588
00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:18.799
P24: This this is a good thing.

589
00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:21.640
P24: This is fine.

590
00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:26.870
Moderator: Okay, what would you do if you saw you entered something by mistake?

591
00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:30.380
P24: I I would hit the edit

592
00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:34.749
P24: and then do the correction and save it.

593
00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:36.270
Moderator: Okay.

594
00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:47.380
Moderator: did that work as you expected.

595
00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:50.440
P24: But

596
00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:57.139
P24: I guess I I wasn't really paying attention to what you were doing. But you if

597
00:43:57.150 --> 00:44:03.559
P24: you edit it. And then, if it remembered it. Put it back in there. You can look at it again to see if the change was made.

598
00:44:04.890 --> 00:44:05.570
Moderator: Okay.

599
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.470
P24: You got update page. So yeah.

600
00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:13.680
Moderator: Okay. Thank you.

601
00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:18.319
P24: See, see with the, with the, with the memory issues that I have.

602
00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:24.200
P24: I would use that extensively. I probably would read it 2 or 3 times, just to make sure

603
00:44:24.550 --> 00:44:25.480
P24: cause I

604
00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:28.000
P24: I get like lapses or

605
00:44:28.310 --> 00:44:29.930
P24: vert numbers, or.

606
00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:35.060
Moderator: Okay.

607
00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:39.680
Moderator: I'm gonna keep going down the page.

608
00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:51.690
P24: Everything seems to be fine there. Primary family curator is the applicant statement.

609
00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:59.899
P24: Yeah, it almost says right here that they they would have to sign, anyway.

610
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:02.989
P24: pick a statement. They made a statement.

611
00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:14.250
P24: Oh, well, that's fine.

612
00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:15.940
P24: Okay.

613
00:45:16.610 --> 00:45:24.790
Moderator: So if you were filling this out, would you want to do it yourself? Would you want your wife to be here? Would you want her to do it.

614
00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:30.539
P24: I probably would do the form. And then, when I come to the review page, I would have her review it.

615
00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:31.230
Moderator: Okay.

616
00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:32.749
P24: It's probably what I would do.

617
00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:35.450
P24: Gotcha. I don't need

618
00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:39.970
P24: for the primary truth. I wouldn't.

619
00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:43.080
P24: I wouldn't need her, but I I would think that the

620
00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:45.630
P24: applicant, if it was for her.

621
00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:49.009
P24: I mean, she would have to do that input.

622
00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:51.750
P24: I mean.

623
00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:53.619
P24: there isn't a lot there.

624
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.660
P24: just basically. So you can identify her.

625
00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:14.909
Moderator: Any other feedback about this page.

626
00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:24.149
P24: Occasion, this whole page, this whole link, is this on the app, or is this? This is my healthy, fat.

627
00:46:25.170 --> 00:46:27.279
Moderator: This is is on va.gov.

628
00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:29.879
Moderator: do you use that website at all?

629
00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:31.680
P24: No.

630
00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:34.520
P24: okay. I use. I use the app.

631
00:46:35.570 --> 00:46:36.065
Moderator: Gotcha.

632
00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:39.530
P24: And they're moving a lot to the app.

633
00:46:40.690 --> 00:46:42.709
P24: It. It would be nice if

634
00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:47.230
P24: what's always

635
00:46:48.550 --> 00:46:54.609
P24: I didn't. I didn't start looking into any Va benefits until after I retired from my regular job.

636
00:46:57.380 --> 00:47:00.260
P24: There's a lot of repetitiveness with

637
00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:03.160
P24: different apps, different websites.

638
00:47:04.110 --> 00:47:06.420
P24: and a lot of them blink

639
00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:08.030
P24: to each other.

640
00:47:10.046 --> 00:47:14.489
P24: I like. I like the app. I wish they would just move everything to that.

641
00:47:15.110 --> 00:47:16.090
P24: Gotcha

642
00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:17.035
P24: it

643
00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:20.933
P24: these forms.

644
00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:35.776
P24: The a lot of the the forms that I filled out. Once I got going with this I used I just want went on and did a search. And

645
00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:38.969
P24: for the forms I needed, and

646
00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:42.099
P24: use one of the websites there with a Pdf.

647
00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:45.130
P24: so I could go in there and print in the information.

648
00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:47.300
P24: okay.

649
00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:50.439
P24: anything, anything that you do

650
00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:56.409
P24: where you can preload information where something triggers and you can preload. It

651
00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:58.440
P24: is a plus. That's

652
00:47:59.832 --> 00:48:01.680
P24: it's saving a step.

653
00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:06.110
P24: It's like the old dos you used to do like 6 steps. Well, now you do one.

654
00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:07.500
Moderator: Yeah.

655
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:12.090
P24: wherever you can keep it. Simple, stupid.

656
00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:16.799
Moderator: Okay, thank you. That's really helpful.

657
00:48:17.664 --> 00:48:25.555
Moderator: So I'm going to share the screen that would come up next. If we hit, submit application.

658
00:48:27.565 --> 00:48:34.619
Moderator: So describe to me in your own words what this page is telling you happened, and what comes in the process.

659
00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:39.490
P24: Okay. Tells me that the form went in

660
00:48:41.325 --> 00:48:42.780
P24: submitted this form.

661
00:48:43.690 --> 00:48:46.009
P24: It does not tell me where it went.

662
00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:49.549
P24: It goes to the Wizard of Oz behind the curtain.

663
00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:53.549
P24: You you giggle. But I'm telling you.

664
00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:55.629
P24: yeah, that's a real. That's a real thing.

665
00:48:56.090 --> 00:48:58.070
Moderator: Yeah, absolutely. That's really helpful.

666
00:48:58.290 --> 00:49:01.790
P24: You can't talk to the person that can make the difference.

667
00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:02.720
Moderator: Yeah.

668
00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:07.639
P24: If I knew exactly where it went, or if you had

669
00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:10.469
P24: number, if you got any other questions.

670
00:49:12.350 --> 00:49:16.340
P24: and then if you call that number they'd be able to answer the question for you. Now

671
00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:18.400
P24: refer to somebody.

672
00:49:22.310 --> 00:49:22.990
Moderator: Bye.

673
00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:28.449
Moderator: So what would you think would happen next? With your application.

674
00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:33.580
P24: Well, it would be in. I would assume that somebody would be looking at it.

675
00:49:33.850 --> 00:49:35.030
P24: There's no

676
00:49:35.710 --> 00:49:38.059
P24: scroll back down there a little bit, could you?

677
00:49:39.046 --> 00:49:43.159
P24: I realize it has to be investigated to make sure that that stuff's

678
00:49:43.570 --> 00:49:44.600
P24: proper.

679
00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:47.410
P24: But there's no

680
00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:57.190
P24: When you're doing a project, you've got a project, and you're sitting there. And usually there's a target date to complete it.

681
00:49:57.870 --> 00:49:58.860
P24: So

682
00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:00.819
P24: you know, this would be.

683
00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:05.170
P24: this will be research, and we'll get back to you in 2 weeks.

684
00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:10.309
P24: or something like that. I and I know the Va. Hates to do that.

685
00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:12.064
P24: But

686
00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:16.140
P24: deadlines are important for some of this stuff.

687
00:50:16.690 --> 00:50:19.609
P24: I'm going through it right now with appeal I've got.

688
00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:21.290
P24: They're not.

689
00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:25.070
P24: They're not setting up my C and P. Exam. And that's all they're waiting for.

690
00:50:26.070 --> 00:50:32.140
P24: and I call in there, and oh, 2 weeks, 2 weeks, 2 weeks! My ass has been at 6 now.

691
00:50:32.490 --> 00:50:34.149
P24: so excuse me.

692
00:50:34.773 --> 00:50:35.520
P24: no, I.

693
00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:36.260
Moderator: Percent.

694
00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:37.600
P24: Well, it's not.

695
00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:42.530
P24: The trouble is the person you're calling up. It's not. Their fault doesn't do any good to.

696
00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:50.859
P24: Aggravate them because they can't do anything about it. They're only giving you information they got. But you can't get to the person that makes a difference.

697
00:50:53.610 --> 00:50:54.180
Moderator: Tempt.

698
00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:56.109
P24: Phyllis can. I've had him

699
00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:57.890
P24: involved a couple times.

700
00:51:00.090 --> 00:51:01.969
P24: They listen to a Senator.

701
00:51:04.090 --> 00:51:05.750
Moderator: Sorry I missed that last part.

702
00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:09.330
P24: I said. They listen to Tom Tillis. They listen to a senator.

703
00:51:10.070 --> 00:51:11.240
Moderator: A senator.

704
00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:12.620
P24: Yeah, I've had them

705
00:51:14.830 --> 00:51:17.679
P24: I've had them involved with on the benefits side.

706
00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:19.910
Moderator: Gotcha. Okay.

707
00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:32.350
P24: yeah, I see here, what do you do for applications denied, or whatever it's.

708
00:51:33.024 --> 00:51:38.259
P24: I guess those are just questions being answered. This. This is fine right here.

709
00:51:38.570 --> 00:51:43.550
P24: I mean, I probably would go through and read it. There's nothing here, really, that I would use, but.

710
00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:48.110
Moderator: Okay.

711
00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:56.329
Moderator: I know you said you would like more information about how long this is gonna take. Is there anything else that you would like to see here.

712
00:52:04.770 --> 00:52:08.420
P24: I don't think so. You've got submission information.

713
00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:11.809
P24: confirmation number.

714
00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:15.977
P24: See? They don't really give you

715
00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:20.650
P24: Confirmation email. And then he will give you an email.

716
00:52:25.390 --> 00:52:28.360
P24: It says you receive a confirmation email. But

717
00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:30.260
P24: usually those are one way

718
00:52:30.330 --> 00:52:32.569
P24: deal. If you could get a hold of somebody

719
00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:35.100
P24: if you didn't

720
00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:38.840
P24: give us your email address. We'll contact you by phone or mail.

721
00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:44.019
P24: How do I contact you if you don't contact me?

722
00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:47.960
P24: There is a number here. I guess

723
00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:54.100
P24: I guess it's okay.

724
00:52:57.290 --> 00:52:58.900
Moderator: Thank you. That's really helpful.

725
00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:01.690
Moderator: I'm gonna stop sharing.

726
00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:06.450
Moderator: Just have a couple of final questions, and then we're all done here. Sorry. I don't know why my video got

727
00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:07.550
Moderator: blurry.

728
00:53:09.926 --> 00:53:17.619
Moderator: Okay. So now that you've seen the form, what research would you want to do before applying and completing that form.

729
00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:22.469
P24: Those dropdown bullets. You know. What's the criteria.

730
00:53:22.850 --> 00:53:24.949
P24: you know? What do I need to do.

731
00:53:26.304 --> 00:53:36.600
P24: It's happened to me before, while I'll file for something, and finally I'll get a hold of somebody later. Isn't anybody getting a hold of me, but I get a hold of them. Well, you need this over here.

732
00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:41.389
P24: It's like this C. And P. Exam. I'm in this appeal.

733
00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:46.410
P24: And they said, and they're they're gathering information. So I call in, they said, oh.

734
00:53:46.460 --> 00:53:49.300
P24: we need to see A. P. Exam. Well.

735
00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:51.350
P24: I can't set that up.

736
00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:53.370
P24: So.

737
00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:54.540
P24: you know.

738
00:53:55.390 --> 00:53:56.539
P24: Do your job.

739
00:53:57.130 --> 00:53:57.790
Moderator: Hmm.

740
00:53:58.730 --> 00:53:59.510
P24: Of

741
00:54:03.380 --> 00:54:09.639
P24: yeah, that I don't think it's a problem if you know the criteria and and know when it's got to be done, and

742
00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:13.730
P24: just a a response, a reasonable time.

743
00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:17.399
P24: yes or no, either way. Just a reasonable response.

744
00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:24.610
P24: And if if it is a no, why not, you know, is there something I have to change, or something you didn't get.

745
00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:28.530
Moderator: Okay, thank you.

746
00:54:29.060 --> 00:54:38.669
Moderator: Would you prefer to have help completing a form like this from an accredited representative like a Vso or someone else from the Va. Or would you want to do it yourself?

747
00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:44.800
P24: You told me you wouldn't be offended by anything right.

748
00:54:45.390 --> 00:54:46.220
Moderator: Absolutely not.

749
00:54:46.710 --> 00:54:48.800
P24: I haven't seen a Vso.

750
00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:51.689
P24: There's been worse there.

751
00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:55.439
P24: They fill out forms, and they're in the same boat I am.

752
00:54:55.650 --> 00:54:56.690
P24: When I

753
00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:58.350
P24: when I

754
00:54:58.610 --> 00:55:00.270
P24: I hired a lawyer.

755
00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:03.050
P24: It started doing the forms that way.

756
00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:06.429
P24: Things started moving because they

757
00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:12.460
P24: know the legal process behind it. Most of the Vsos are just filling the

758
00:55:12.530 --> 00:55:16.659
P24: filling the things out. I I don't know what the lawyers know that I don't, but.

759
00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:21.129
P24: I get more action that way than I do with a

760
00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:22.330
P24: on my own

761
00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:27.590
P24: and the vsos a lot a lot of them, let's say, do this all the time.

762
00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:29.060
P24: They just

763
00:55:30.270 --> 00:55:32.019
P24: they're not valuable to me.

764
00:55:32.783 --> 00:55:35.719
P24: I mean, I'm I'm not wasting my time with one.

765
00:55:36.750 --> 00:55:39.130
Moderator: Gotcha. Thank you, that's helpful.

766
00:55:39.628 --> 00:55:46.890
Moderator: What were your thoughts about the amount of information that was provided in the form? Did you think it was too much, too little, or just enough.

767
00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:49.690
P24: Oh.

768
00:55:53.420 --> 00:56:03.240
P24: the amount of information is fine, because that's what you got on. There is kind of normal with everything else. The only thing that, I would add. So I could tell you if somebody's disabled.

769
00:56:04.110 --> 00:56:05.677
P24: they're gonna have that

770
00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:07.969
P24: the benefits number

771
00:56:09.434 --> 00:56:17.360
P24: if you connect that benefits number to the person. A lot of that information will be filled right in for you. It'll just

772
00:56:17.610 --> 00:56:21.629
P24: if you punch in that number, have it so boom! It just drops everything right in.

773
00:56:22.250 --> 00:56:26.299
P24: and it'll be accurate, and you'll have the same information that

774
00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:28.929
P24: the Va. Has. There's a benefits.

775
00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:38.210
P24: see, there's something I had to learn to the health, the health side and the benefits side are 2 different animals entirely.

776
00:56:39.070 --> 00:56:46.270
P24: and although the benefit site is supposed to be looking at your health medical records. They don't always.

777
00:56:46.460 --> 00:56:49.709
P24: So you pretty much kind of go do the research yourself

778
00:56:49.870 --> 00:56:51.490
P24: and give it to them.

779
00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:53.190
P24: So

780
00:56:53.790 --> 00:56:54.610
P24: just

781
00:56:55.790 --> 00:57:00.899
P24: this right here is kind of an addition to benefits. I think it would.

782
00:57:01.110 --> 00:57:07.149
P24: It would speed up. The process is all. If the window dumped down and everything was the same number.

783
00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:10.330
P24: If that number goes in towards the beginning.

784
00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:18.239
P24: and you have the backup information or so can do a search and just drop those windows down. You probably could. You probably could do that

785
00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:22.479
P24: that form like 5 min if that.

786
00:57:23.130 --> 00:57:23.780
Moderator: Okay.

787
00:57:25.170 --> 00:57:32.280
Moderator: is there any additional information about who qualifies to be a primary or a secondary caregiver that you would have liked to see in this form.

788
00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:41.474
P24: I guess I I guess so I mean

789
00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:44.169
P24: I guess not, because the

790
00:57:45.470 --> 00:57:49.799
P24: of course, I guess Caregiver could mean 2 different things to 2 different people.

791
00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:55.779
P24: A caregiver to me is like an assistant. It's not like

792
00:57:56.550 --> 00:57:58.619
P24: it's an assistance. It's not

793
00:57:58.730 --> 00:58:00.610
P24: doing things for you.

794
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:02.160
Moderator: Hmm.

795
00:58:02.450 --> 00:58:03.230
P24: You know.

796
00:58:04.590 --> 00:58:05.490
P24: Alright.

797
00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:07.500
P24: No, I guess

798
00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:12.679
P24: that part was fine. I don't. I don't know why that you would need the need for a second caregiver that just

799
00:58:13.290 --> 00:58:15.199
P24: you're filling out a form for caregiver

800
00:58:15.870 --> 00:58:19.699
P24: boom. If there's a second person you fill out a form for the caregiver.

801
00:58:21.570 --> 00:58:22.180
Moderator: Okay.

802
00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:25.420
Moderator: thank you. That's helpful.

803
00:58:25.932 --> 00:58:37.630
Moderator: Well, that was all the questions that I have for you, Charles. I just want to circle back and reconfirm. Are you comfortable? If we were to share a video clip of this session with our Va partners removing any identifying information.

804
00:58:37.850 --> 00:58:38.580
P24: Yes.

805
00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:43.380
Moderator: Is there any part of our discussion that you wouldn't want shared in a video clip.

806
00:58:45.330 --> 00:58:47.700
P24: I'm 76. What do I care?

807
00:58:48.246 --> 00:58:59.333
Moderator: Okay? Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us. This will help us continue to improve the site and make sure it's really working for veterans and caregivers.

808
00:58:59.650 --> 00:59:06.299
P24: Hold on a second, do you? Are any of the people involved in their work on the app at all?

809
00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:13.559
Moderator: Not in this group. But if you have feedback I can certainly relay it to them.

810
00:59:14.130 --> 00:59:14.990
P24: Okay.

811
00:59:15.170 --> 00:59:16.480
P24: appointments.

812
00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:20.000
P24: I have to use 2 different

813
00:59:20.420 --> 00:59:21.979
P24: things to do with the

814
00:59:22.610 --> 00:59:25.330
P24: the appointment. There's an appointment scheduled

815
00:59:25.810 --> 00:59:26.999
P24: in the app.

816
00:59:27.170 --> 00:59:28.634
P24: It will give you

817
00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:30.550
P24: the doctor.

818
00:59:31.290 --> 00:59:34.390
P24: but it doesn't tell you what it's for. It'll give you the time.

819
00:59:35.060 --> 00:59:40.019
P24: but it doesn't give you the location or what it's for. When you go into my health. Event.

820
00:59:41.050 --> 00:59:42.269
P24: he he!

821
00:59:42.410 --> 00:59:45.279
P24: It dumps down all that information. Now

822
00:59:45.660 --> 00:59:50.019
P24: I I love the app it is so much easier to use.

823
00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:53.939
P24: but that the appointment end of it

824
00:59:54.430 --> 00:59:55.590
P24: needs

825
00:59:56.980 --> 01:00:00.390
P24: need some additional information dumped in there like the

826
01:00:02.583 --> 01:00:03.790
P24: myself, like.

827
01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:11.809
P24: If you go into my healthy vet and you go to the appointment thing. It'll tell you what it's for. Okay, this is cardiac.

828
01:00:11.970 --> 01:00:14.009
P24: If this is primary care.

829
01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:20.380
P24: this is where it is. This is the time it is. This is the date it is. And this is who you're gonna see.

830
01:00:22.150 --> 01:00:25.249
P24: And the the app doesn't do that.

831
01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:27.090
P24: So

832
01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:38.099
P24: I like what they're doing with the app? Don't get me wrong. I I like. It's just not enough information for me, because I can't like over. I can't.

833
01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:42.850
P24: When I go to the Va. I need to know what room I've I've got to go.

834
01:00:43.350 --> 01:00:46.979
P24: And is it there? I've got to open up my healthy vet.

835
01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:49.420
P24: It wouldn't look at it that way.

836
01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:51.210
P24: So

837
01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:52.230
P24: if

838
01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:57.319
P24: they need to take the information, sign my healthy vet, which is great and just

839
01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:59.509
P24: mirror it over on the app.

840
01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:02.249
P24: I wouldn't think that'd be a huge deal.

841
01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:04.090
P24: Maybe I'm not a

842
01:01:05.070 --> 01:01:06.210
P24: I'm not a

843
01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:08.290
P24: programmer, but

844
01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:14.650
P24: they push information around all the time. I retired from time Warner cable, so I know they can

845
01:01:14.890 --> 01:01:17.509
P24: do lots of things with information.

846
01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:18.850
Moderator: Yeah.

847
01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:28.440
Moderator: alright. Thank you so much, Charles. I will give them that feedback. I know that they're working on that feature is like fairly new. And they're definitely

848
01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:30.110
Moderator: still making improvements to it.

849
01:01:30.110 --> 01:01:38.490
P24: Well, well, give him give him a pat on the back, because that is, it is good, and it'd be nice to do everything moved right there. Boom! You have one spot.

850
01:01:39.050 --> 01:01:43.970
Moderator: Okay will do. Thank you so much, Charles, and I'm glad that it's useful to you for the most part.

851
01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:47.349
P24: Okay, thank you. Thank you. It's nice talking with you.

852
01:01:47.350 --> 01:01:50.139
Moderator: You, too, have a great rest of your day.

853
01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:52.440
Moderator: Bye.
