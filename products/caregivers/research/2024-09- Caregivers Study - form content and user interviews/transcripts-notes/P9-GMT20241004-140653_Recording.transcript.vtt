00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:09.100
Moderator: Alright. I have started recording. So I just wanna confirm once again, are you comfortable? If I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

2
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:10.240
P9: Yes.

3
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:19.670
Moderator: Okay, thank you so much. And are you comfortable? If we decided to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other Va. Partners. If we removed any identifying information.

4
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:20.650
P9: Sure.

5
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:37.080
Moderator: Okay, thank you so much getting through that. So before we take a look at that caregiver online form together, I have a couple of questions for you. Is it correct that you are enrolled in the program of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers?

6
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.010
P9: Correct.

7
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.779
Moderator: Okay? And can you confirm that you applied about one or 2 years ago.

8
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.020
P9: Yes.

9
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.080
P9: Correct.

10
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:53.540
Moderator: Thank you. If you were going to explain the caregiver program to someone who is interested in rolling, how? How would you explain it?

11
00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:00.119
P9: So it's basically everything being online in one portal

12
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.700
P9: for caregivers to be able to

13
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:11.199
P9: gather information, do research, communicate questions. So

14
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:18.129
P9: it's everything that you do, but being on an online portal which makes it really convenient.

15
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.470
Moderator: Yeah. What online portal do you use to manage

16
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.550
Moderator: caregiver things.

17
00:01:25.339 --> 00:01:28.839
P9: I just go directly to the to the website.

18
00:01:29.497 --> 00:01:32.960
P9: and and go from there. So

19
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.909
P9: I have a number of different

20
00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.490
P9: Va sites in my favorites.

21
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.880
Moderator: Alright!

22
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.579
P9: And depending on the issue that I'm dealing with.

23
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.620
P9: I will go directly to the portals. So you know, probably

24
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.330
P9: 1015 years ago it

25
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.009
P9: used to take a lot longer to do research because it was all

26
00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.120
P9: phone calls or waiting for information to arrive

27
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.840
P9: via mail. But now I can just go to.

28
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.820
P9: you know, va.gov or

29
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:15.069
P9: Va. benefits.gov or Va. Medical information.gov. Or Va.

30
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.880
P9: There's several sites in Massachusetts.

31
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.080
P9: There's Jamaica Plain and Brockton, which are the major sites. So

32
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.509
P9: it's just a lot easier to manage everything.

33
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.470
Moderator: Okay, gotcha.

34
00:02:32.144 --> 00:02:37.239
Moderator: Are you familiar with the concept of a primary and secondary caregiver?

35
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.460
P9: Yes.

36
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.170
Moderator: Okay. And do you know which one you're enrolled as.

37
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.190
P9: Primary.

38
00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:55.289
Moderator: Okay? So when you applied for the caregiver program and completed that form to sign up, do you remember if that was in person at a facility or online. Do you remember how you did that.

39
00:02:56.313 --> 00:03:00.749
P9: I'm pretty sure it was in person, because that's when

40
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.370
P9: things really changed than being able to.

41
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.450
P9: you know. Get some information.

42
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.220
P9: apply, and then, once it was

43
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.790
P9: ready to go.

44
00:03:11.232 --> 00:03:13.770
P9: I was able to do things online.

45
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.720
Moderator: Okay.

46
00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:24.419
Moderator: and what did you do in preparation for applying in person? Did you any research or anything on your own.

47
00:03:25.868 --> 00:03:28.700
P9: Not a ton, because

48
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.740
P9: I think you know.

49
00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.140
P9: every application that we've been able to

50
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.309
P9: bring online for ourselves has just made life easier.

51
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.959
P9: So you know whether it be your banking.

52
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.932
P9: whether it be

53
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.659
P9: You know general medical

54
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:57.030
P9: things for myself or my family or college. It like everything is just so much easier

55
00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.630
P9: via an online portal.

56
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:08.229
Moderator: Okay, did you look up information about it online, or what happened before you enrolled for the program.

57
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:21.620
P9: Just some general research, what you know, what was entailed. You know what the project was all about, what the website was all about. So on and so forth, but nothing really more than that, because

58
00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:25.839
P9: I was just excited to be able to do everything via a portal.

59
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.490
Moderator: Yeah, okay.

60
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.919
Moderator: So how did you find out about the caregiver program?

61
00:04:33.257 --> 00:04:35.559
P9: Through the doctor

62
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.020
P9: that my father had so.

63
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.069
Moderator: Gotcha wrong?

64
00:04:40.887 --> 00:04:46.770
Moderator: Great. So when you completed that form in person to sign up for the caregiver program.

65
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:54.339
Moderator: did you do that on your own? Or did you have help from someone like an accredited representative, or a Vso or other source.

66
00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.880
P9: I think I called a couple of folks

67
00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.230
P9: in the community that I was connected to.

68
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.870
P9: just, you know, a couple of questions, but nothing more than that.

69
00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:08.050
Moderator: Okay?

70
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.580
Moderator: And then, when you actually filled out the form, you just did that yourself.

71
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.030
P9: Yes, and then, if there were any particular questions, it was

72
00:05:17.491 --> 00:05:25.169
P9: there's a few local offices not too far from us that I have talked to people before.

73
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.930
P9: So I have their phone number. So I was able to to ask them questions.

74
00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.900
Moderator: Okay.

75
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:37.350
Moderator: do you know what those local offices are? They're like veteran service organization.

76
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.030
P9: Yeah.

77
00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:39.329
Moderator: And that sort of thing.

78
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:40.879
P9: Yes, for sure.

79
00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.350
Moderator: Says, Okay.

80
00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:48.539
Moderator: is there anything else that you'd like to share about your experience applying for the caregiver program, good or bad.

81
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.406
P9: You know, I think that.

82
00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.520
P9: it's just awesome to have things online

83
00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.769
P9: again. You know.

84
00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:04.620
P9: they used to be pretty big files of information, and

85
00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.800
P9: it was more cumbersome.

86
00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.659
P9: you know, to find things. It just.

87
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.440
P9: It's just quicker to be able to go into a system. But

88
00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.230
P9: I do a lot of work on the computer, a lot of work online.

89
00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:19.676
P9: So it's

90
00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:22.830
P9: It was not hard for me

91
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.989
P9: to sort of maneuver around.

92
00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:27.909
Moderator: Good to know.

93
00:06:28.597 --> 00:06:34.029
Moderator: Is there a site that you find most helpful in managing your caregiver role.

94
00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.099
P9: I probably do

95
00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:42.929
P9: the the benefit site most.

96
00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.620
Moderator: Is, that e benefits.

97
00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:45.530
P9: Yeah.

98
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:46.220
Moderator: Okay.

99
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.750
P9: Because that's usually what

100
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.359
P9: I have to access in in order to

101
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:56.239
P9: get information or process information.

102
00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:59.500
P9: yeah.

103
00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:00.979
P9: I would take that one.

104
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:03.570
Moderator: Alright. Thank you so much.

105
00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:13.619
Moderator: So we're gonna change gears a bit and take a look at that form. I'm going to send you the link to our testing site in the zoom chat.

106
00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:14.420
P9: Sure.

107
00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.909
Moderator: You know, if you need any help finding it.

108
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:19.780
P9: Okay, got it?

109
00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:26.499
Moderator: Okay, once you have that link open, I'm gonna want you to share your screen with me in zoom. So feel free to

110
00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:31.629
Moderator: hide anything you don't want me to see or just share that individual window possible.

111
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:47.319
P9: Are you good?

112
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:49.160
Moderator: I see it. Yeah.

113
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:49.820
P9: Okay.

114
00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:51.040
Moderator: Thank you so much.

115
00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:58.449
Moderator: Okay, so I just want you to review this page and tell me what your initial thoughts and expectations would be of this form

116
00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.620
Moderator: before going forward and applying.

117
00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.609
Moderator: You can take your time going through the page.

118
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:41.909
P9: So

119
00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:45.454
P9: I think it's laid out easily.

120
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:48.570
P9: and

121
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:51.249
P9: the only thing that I would

122
00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:56.159
P9: wanna see in the headers

123
00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.160
P9: is, maybe.

124
00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:04.650
P9: you know, like the the main prompts that people need to do.

125
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.180
P9: maybe have them highlighted. So

126
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:10.940
P9: where it says, apply.

127
00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:13.380
P9: And then.

128
00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:17.750
P9: you know, follow these steps, maybe having those.

129
00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.770
P9: maybe in the blue, like those are the the main

130
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.290
P9: pieces.

131
00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:31.520
P9: and then the the start. Your application, I think, should be a little bit bolder. So

132
00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.969
P9: if it could be that those

133
00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:39.260
P9: specific prompts were

134
00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:45.099
P9: more readily available to the reader. Because I I really I don't know

135
00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:51.469
P9: The demographics of those that are going to apply.

136
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.640
P9: But

137
00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:56.580
P9: a lot of people just have different skill levels

138
00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:03.550
P9: of being online and being in a web based portal. So the more the portal can

139
00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:06.319
P9: talk to them in a way.

140
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.180
P9: the better it is. And then

141
00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.170
P9: on my screen.

142
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.560
P9: where it says, apply for

143
00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:22.439
P9: the program of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers.

144
00:10:23.432 --> 00:10:28.260
P9: This is in small print. It kind of gets lost.

145
00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:33.070
P9: so I'm not sure

146
00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:38.809
P9: if it should, if that should come out. But then you come to

147
00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:42.265
P9: apply, or maybe you say

148
00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:45.860
P9: you know, follow these.

149
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.009
P9: Well, you do say, follow these steps, but

150
00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:50.850
P9: maybe those

151
00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:54.989
P9: follow these steps to get started.

152
00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:58.619
P9: and that comes up here

153
00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:02.979
P9: before you know where this small part is.

154
00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:05.296
P9: And then

155
00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.429
P9: you sort of outline. Apply

156
00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.280
P9: and then check your eligibility.

157
00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:15.700
P9: Gather your information.

158
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:19.959
P9: So those are just a few things.

159
00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:23.579
P9: just because I think things can get lost.

160
00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:28.779
P9: Does that sound.

161
00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:29.850
Moderator: Yeah.

162
00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:32.390
P9: Is, that is that the kind of feedback you were looking for.

163
00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:38.559
Moderator: Yeah, definitely. It's interesting also to see like what you're seeing on your screen, like, it's

164
00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:42.250
Moderator: funky. It's good to just see it on different.

165
00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:45.549
Moderator: and how people visit websites.

166
00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:47.666
P9: Yeah. And I think, too,

167
00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:54.709
P9: the dark blue of the Us. Department of veteran affairs.

168
00:11:54.930 --> 00:12:00.979
P9: I think, could be maybe that's a way to to highlight some of these areas.

169
00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:03.662
P9: But again, it's

170
00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:09.450
P9: It's interesting. Like, when you go to an airline website

171
00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:12.010
P9: or hotel website

172
00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:18.320
P9: like you, just, you need prompts the brain, just need prompt needs, prompts.

173
00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:19.770
P9: I think.

174
00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:22.840
Moderator: Sure. Thank you so much for that feedback.

175
00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.179
P9: Those few things.

176
00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:26.830
P9: It's got a really great start.

177
00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:35.019
Moderator: Okay, is there anything on this page that stands out to you as being particularly confusing or really helpful?

178
00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:42.340
P9: helpful again is, you know, apply for the program.

179
00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.830
P9: Follow these steps.

180
00:12:47.115 --> 00:12:48.050
P9: It.

181
00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.229
P9: It's interesting, because.

182
00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:55.609
P9: you know, you start your application.

183
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:58.410
P9: I'm not sure

184
00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.939
P9: if that should be before.

185
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:04.809
P9: What if I have questions?

186
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:10.130
P9: Because it says we'll take you through each step of the process?

187
00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.580
P9: But then.

188
00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:17.820
P9: you know it's asking. Do you need help before you start? But

189
00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:22.370
P9: it may be that you want to have people start.

190
00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:26.160
P9: but then, if they have questions.

191
00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:31.189
P9: then go to the questions you're asking for the questions before

192
00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:32.579
P9: they've started.

193
00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:34.690
Moderator: Okay.

194
00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:40.629
P9: just looking here.

195
00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:46.450
P9: Yeah, I think that's important.

196
00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:49.989
P9: So I would go to.

197
00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:57.370
P9: I would bring 3 up above. What if I have questions.

198
00:14:01.807 --> 00:14:03.930
P9: But everything else.

199
00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.490
P9: No is.

200
00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:14.219
P9: It's well laid out just for those few things that I mentioned earlier.

201
00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:18.171
Moderator: Okay, thank you so much.

202
00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:25.340
Moderator: if you're going to rate this page on a scale of one to 5, 1 being the worst and 5 being the best.

203
00:14:25.839 --> 00:14:32.100
Moderator: How prepared and informed do you feel about the application you're about to begin? Based on this page's content.

204
00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:40.190
P9: Say, probably a 4.

205
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:42.780
Moderator: Okay. Why would you give it that rating.

206
00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.129
P9: you know, it's

207
00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:52.859
P9: it's explaining. It's the application for the program of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers.

208
00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:57.179
P9: It's explaining. Use this form.

209
00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:04.250
P9: you know it has. You go through, start your application. I think that

210
00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:08.219
P9: you can check your eligibility. 1st and foremost.

211
00:15:09.171 --> 00:15:13.900
P9: Hopefully. People have already, you know, gathered information.

212
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:18.280
P9: so that they can start the application. But

213
00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:20.639
P9: it's well laid out.

214
00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:22.730
P9: and

215
00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:29.360
P9: you know it tells you what to do if you need assistance. So I I would say.

216
00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:31.530
P9: probably a low 4.

217
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:34.259
Moderator: Okay, I love that a lot more.

218
00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:40.529
Moderator: Okay, so we can go ahead and start the application. Now.

219
00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:42.300
P9: Okay.

220
00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:46.710
P9: sorry. There's a helicopter in the background.

221
00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:51.580
Moderator: That's okay. Take your time. That can be pretty loud.

222
00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:52.230
P9: Yeah.

223
00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:53.062
Moderator: Yes, it is.

224
00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:58.110
P9: Okay.

225
00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:02.310
Moderator: Okay. So if you see how to start the application, you can go ahead and do that.

226
00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:05.740
P9: Okay.

227
00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:15.759
Moderator: Okay. So I'm just gonna have you go through the form however, realistically as possible, and just keep thinking aloud as you are

228
00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:26.320
Moderator: filling out the form as though you are applying for the caregiver program. Just a reminder. This is a testing site. So you do not have to worry about any information you enter, going anywhere

229
00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:32.670
Moderator: you can feel free to enter real or fake information. It doesn't matter. We will make sure it's not shared anywhere with anyone.

230
00:16:33.048 --> 00:16:37.669
Moderator: And I'll give you a fake social security number when we get to that. That step.

231
00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:38.730
P9: Sure.

232
00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:43.500
P9: So you actually want me to start filling it out.

233
00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:44.240
Moderator: Yep.

234
00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:52.980
P9: Hi.

235
00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:54.370
Moderator: Wow!

236
00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:55.600
P9: Yeah.

237
00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:26.104
Moderator: Well, maybe that was your real birthday. I was gonna say, happy birthday.

238
00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:28.261
P9: Oh, no! I was.

239
00:17:29.013 --> 00:17:29.366
Moderator: State.

240
00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:39.109
P9: Okay, go ahead.

241
00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:41.790
Moderator: Okay. So you can put 3, 2, 1,

242
00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:45.429
Moderator: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

243
00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:52.740
P9: Would not be easy if we had social security numbers that we could

244
00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:58.068
P9: put into algorithms that really we could understand.

245
00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.539
P9: Do you want me to press? Continue.

246
00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:12.300
Moderator: Yeah, I just have a quick question. If you were, if you had to enter the social security number of the veteran that you're a caregiver for would that be easy for you, or.

247
00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:16.889
P9: I have it in a a quick file.

248
00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:18.090
P9: Yes.

249
00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:21.809
Moderator: Okay? And what's your comfort level with putting that in this form.

250
00:18:22.142 --> 00:18:24.800
P9: You know what I am less and less

251
00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:27.959
P9: inclined to want to use a social security number.

252
00:18:28.693 --> 00:18:35.789
P9: I'd rather I wish there were something else. You know the Ssn number or something. There's a different number.

253
00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:38.000
P9: like a license number.

254
00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:42.639
P9: But

255
00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:43.690
P9: you know.

256
00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:46.240
P9: if that's all you have.

257
00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:50.889
P9: but it is the the veterans administration, so I wouldn't.

258
00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:55.080
P9: I wouldn't question it too much, but you always wonder

259
00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:58.379
P9: if it's gonna get into the hands of the wrong person.

260
00:18:58.540 --> 00:18:59.290
P9: Yes.

261
00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:00.310
Moderator: Okay.

262
00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:02.419
Moderator: thank you. You can keep going.

263
00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:03.390
P9: Sure.

264
00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.740
P9: and I'm just putting in whatever comes up.

265
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:21.109
Moderator: Okay. So just please keep thinking aloud as you complete this question. I'm curious how you would prefer to search for Va facilities.

266
00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.355
P9: So

267
00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:28.070
P9: I would probably want to put in the city so.

268
00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:31.699
Moderator: You can go ahead and do that.

269
00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:32.670
P9: Okay.

270
00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:39.170
P9: And there it is.

271
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:40.490
Moderator: Okay.

272
00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:49.969
Moderator: okay,

273
00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:56.720
Moderator: So if you wanted to change that facility that you entered, how would you do that?

274
00:20:58.402 --> 00:21:00.090
P9: Let's see here.

275
00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:05.360
P9: I would go back and

276
00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:09.800
P9: put in Jamaica plane because I saw a number of them come up

277
00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:11.760
P9: and

278
00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:15.309
P9: I would look through this list.

279
00:21:16.786 --> 00:21:20.070
P9: If it was in another

280
00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:21.470
P9: state.

281
00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:25.600
P9: Let's say it was Rhode Island. I would put in the State

282
00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:31.620
P9: and see what came up with that.

283
00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:32.910
Moderator: Okay.

284
00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.580
P9: But again, you know.

285
00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:37.900
P9: I

286
00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:41.279
P9: do a lot of work online.

287
00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:45.430
P9: And I mentioned this earlier in the conversation that

288
00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:50.390
P9: it's more intuitive for me

289
00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:56.170
P9: to be able to maneuver around just because I'm online a lot. If you're

290
00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:59.690
P9: if this is for someone that isn't

291
00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:04.250
P9: as experience doing things online.

292
00:22:05.102 --> 00:22:06.969
P9: it can be.

293
00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:11.209
P9: you know, a little more cumbersome. As I said earlier.

294
00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.311
P9: so I think you have to be really

295
00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:18.680
P9: careful with the prompts, and have the site

296
00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:20.850
P9: really talk to

297
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.770
P9: the person, and that that's a challenge that you all have as you pull this together.

298
00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:27.740
Moderator: Yeah.

299
00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:34.060
Moderator: is there anything that you think would be particularly difficult for other veterans and caregivers?

300
00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:37.120
P9: You know, I think some people just get.

301
00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:44.719
P9: you know, going online and and doing this when they're used to pulling files and folders and brochures

302
00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:50.469
P9: and doing things by phone. I think we've all been forced to learn

303
00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:52.759
P9: how to do things

304
00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:54.760
P9: online, but

305
00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:58.109
P9: it can be intimidated, especially for

306
00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:00.173
P9: elderly folks,

307
00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:05.619
P9: or folks that you know don't have English

308
00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:08.059
P9: as their 1st language.

309
00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:18.179
P9: and that's very common. So I think you could do like a a video that was available

310
00:23:18.963 --> 00:23:25.619
P9: or you could have just an overview. I don't know if you've ever seen the

311
00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:30.419
P9: The there's a a little

312
00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:34.949
P9: widget that you can put on the website, and it translates

313
00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:37.919
P9: into like a hundred 50 languages.

314
00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:40.359
P9: Have you? Do you know about that?

315
00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:43.310
Moderator: Not in particular, but.

316
00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:44.045
P9: Yeah.

317
00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:45.259
Moderator: Do we have that.

318
00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:52.490
P9: Something where? There's a widget, because our population, if for my work

319
00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:56.400
P9: there's a widget, you click on it, and it will

320
00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:04.230
P9: if it. If you say Portuguese, everything will come up in Portuguese. If you say Spanish, everything come up in Spanish, so

321
00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:07.540
P9: there could be something in terms of accessibility.

322
00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.200
P9: that you could

323
00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:13.220
P9: add, you know.

324
00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:16.189
P9: But I just think that

325
00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:19.740
P9: it's gotta be intuitive for people

326
00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:22.610
P9: to be able to get through.

327
00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:25.230
Moderator: Yeah, thank you so much for that feedback.

328
00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:26.070
P9: Sure.

329
00:24:26.826 --> 00:24:30.030
Moderator: So you can go ahead and select a facility.

330
00:24:30.975 --> 00:24:34.060
Moderator: Pick the one that you would actually pick.

331
00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:38.330
P9: Okay, that's my, was my question. Okay? So I'm gonna go

332
00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:39.680
P9: back

333
00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:41.150
P9: and

334
00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:44.519
P9: and I'm gonna come here.

335
00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:47.900
P9: And then I'm gonna put

336
00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:51.430
P9: plane.

337
00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:56.040
P9: Here. We are.

338
00:24:57.030 --> 00:24:57.730
P9: Okay.

339
00:24:57.730 --> 00:24:59.740
Moderator: Why are you selecting that facility.

340
00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:05.450
P9: that's the one that I'm familiar with

341
00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:11.840
P9: and that some of the the caregivers are at.

342
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.920
Moderator: Okay.

343
00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:21.640
Moderator: what were your thoughts about this process of selecting a facility? And if you were to rate it one to 5 again.

344
00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:26.240
Moderator: one being bad, 5 being good. Would you rate this process.

345
00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:27.869
P9: Was pretty good.

346
00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:29.840
P9: I think that was pretty easy.

347
00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:32.989
P9: Can you hold on just one second.

348
00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:34.280
Moderator: Absolutely go ahead.

349
00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:45.250
Moderator: sweet!

350
00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:48.520
P9: Okay. I understand that, John.

351
00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:50.260
P9: Very good.

352
00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:53.349
P9: Do you want me to put continue.

353
00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:56.289
Moderator: Yep, go ahead.

354
00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:59.090
Moderator: What would you rate it? 1, 2, 5,

355
00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:00.970
Moderator: just selecting if it.

356
00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:09.119
P9: I'd have to say.

357
00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:16.490
P9: probably a 4 again.

358
00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:19.060
P9: between 3 and a 4.

359
00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:23.720
P9: yeah.

360
00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:26.369
Moderator: Okay, why is that.

361
00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:35.150
P9: again it the subcategories. I think

362
00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:36.959
P9: I'd like to see

363
00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:44.439
P9: just it come out a little bit more to the user.

364
00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:50.499
P9: So whether it's there's a color here

365
00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:59.229
P9: on search. Continue the prompts, maybe have that the same as these. The sub editing.

366
00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:03.020
Moderator: The same like color.

367
00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:04.070
P9: Yes.

368
00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:05.450
Moderator: Okay.

369
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:11.169
P9: Because these are these are prompts. Right

370
00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:17.220
P9: the search and continue. So the Va Medical Center.

371
00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:21.870
P9: That piece here, if it was the same, it acts more like a

372
00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:23.340
P9: a prompt.

373
00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:24.380
Moderator: Okay.

374
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:31.080
Moderator: thank you for that feedback. Let's just go ahead and select that facility again and move on to the next step.

375
00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:32.410
P9: Sure.

376
00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:41.480
P9: Okay.

377
00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.029
Moderator: You can keep going.

378
00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:49.780
Moderator: So what does the term primary caregiver mean to you?

379
00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:55.530
P9: The person that is fully in charge of the

380
00:27:56.310 --> 00:28:00.850
P9: patient, you know, veteran who is in need. So

381
00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:03.930
P9: it would be the number one person

382
00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:07.999
P9: in the family who's responsible for care.

383
00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:09.830
Moderator: Okay.

384
00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:20.269
Moderator: Gotcha. So let's go through a scenario where you are adding a primary caregiver to this application, and just keep thinking aloud about your thought process, as you try to add that.

385
00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:21.450
P9: Okay.

386
00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:33.680
P9: So do you want me to put in

387
00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:36.860
P9: information here? Just go through the process.

388
00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:41.590
Moderator: Yep, as though you're adding the primary caregiver to the application.

389
00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:43.690
P9: Okay.

390
00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:44.570
P9: let's see.

391
00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:22.289
P9: was that the right number.

392
00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:26.879
P9: the the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

393
00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:30.780
Moderator: Probably not going to allow that, but it might, if you change one number.

394
00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:32.550
P9: Okay, go ahead. Which one.

395
00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:36.690
Moderator: Try changing like the last number to 8. Let's see if it takes that.

396
00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:40.650
P9: Oh, very good.

397
00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:44.899
Moderator: You just won't take that like sequential gotcha.

398
00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:50.790
P9: To make it easy. I'll do that.

399
00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:55.150
P9: Okay.

400
00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:27.759
Moderator: Okay? And what does a secondary caregiver mean to you?

401
00:30:29.078 --> 00:30:34.010
P9: This would be someone else in the family or

402
00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:40.849
P9: extended family that would have the responsibility if the primary caregiver

403
00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:42.600
P9: is not available.

404
00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:51.460
Moderator: Okay? And how do you think that the secondary caregiver role differs in the application process and the benefits from the primary caregiver.

405
00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:00.949
P9: I would think that the secondary

406
00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:04.819
P9: would probably be similar.

407
00:31:06.044 --> 00:31:08.830
P9: Just because there are times when

408
00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:12.370
P9: very often a primary care caregiver.

409
00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:17.339
P9: you know, isn't available or can't get to something. So

410
00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:23.339
P9: I think it's it's common.

411
00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.640
Moderator: Common to what's common.

412
00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:31.759
P9: That a secondary family caregiver would need to

413
00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:35.469
P9: be part of this process. Be doing this process.

414
00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:37.310
Moderator: Okay, gotcha.

415
00:31:37.792 --> 00:31:44.609
Moderator: so let's go through the form as though we are adding a secondary caregiver as well to the application, and just continue to think aloud.

416
00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:45.840
P9: Sure.

417
00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:33.360
P9: Okay.

418
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:38.089
Moderator: Keep going.

419
00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:43.289
Moderator: Put another one in with just one number changed, I guess.

420
00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:51.620
P9: Oops.

421
00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.880
P9: Oh, it took it!

422
00:32:57.710 --> 00:32:59.310
Moderator: It's not that picky.

423
00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:22.860
P9: Okay.

424
00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:32.689
P9: So that was the prompts were good.

425
00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:39.230
P9: So it's not allowing me to continue so.

426
00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:40.429
Moderator: Oh, it's not.

427
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:41.250
P9: No.

428
00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:43.380
Moderator: What that it's not doing anything.

429
00:33:43.942 --> 00:33:49.259
P9: Nope, when you get to, is the caregivers mailing address the same as their home address.

430
00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:53.299
Moderator: And then did you click, continue.

431
00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:54.770
P9: Yes.

432
00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:55.720
Moderator: Oh!

433
00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:58.239
P9: Let me try putting no in here.

434
00:33:58.520 --> 00:33:59.300
P9: Nope.

435
00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:00.280
Moderator: Hmm.

436
00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:01.720
P9: It stops right there.

437
00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:05.220
Moderator: Very strange. I haven't seen it do that

438
00:34:07.793 --> 00:34:11.039
Moderator: maybe we should try refreshing the page.

439
00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:12.159
P9: Okay.

440
00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:19.189
Moderator: Could you do that in your browser? Refresh the page.

441
00:34:19.509 --> 00:34:23.959
P9: Sure. So you want me to just go up here to the caregiver.

442
00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:29.800
Moderator: I would just do like the refresh arrow that's next to your back arrow in your browser

443
00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:32.310
Moderator: next to the URL,

444
00:34:32.739 --> 00:34:33.829
Moderator: you see that.

445
00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:38.320
P9: Okay.

446
00:34:42.393 --> 00:34:46.829
Moderator: No! On the on the window where the form was open.

447
00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:48.310
P9: Okay.

448
00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:50.130
Moderator: I see your email now.

449
00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:51.229
P9: Okay, go ahead.

450

452
00:35:02.158 --> 00:35:05.109
Moderator: To the left of that. There's the refresh arrow.

453
00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:06.630
P9: Oh, there it is. Okay.

454
00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:11.689
Moderator: Let's do that and see if that helps. I've just never. I haven't seen this happening.

455
00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:13.780
Moderator: So let's try that.

456
00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:15.550
P9: Okay.

457
00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:17.149
P9: I clicked it.

458
00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:19.360
Moderator: And then do reload

459
00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:22.130
Moderator: in that. Pop up.

460
00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:30.070
Moderator: Do you see the pop up that says reload site.

461
00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:32.230
P9: No!

462
00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:34.199
P9: Oh, here we go!

463
00:35:34.290 --> 00:35:40.450
P9: Oh, you know what it is! My all the zoom prompts. I'm gonna move them to the bottom of the page.

464
00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:42.659
Moderator: Okay, yeah, they're getting in the way.

465
00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:43.760
P9: There you go!

466
00:35:48.170 --> 00:35:48.870
Moderator: Who?

467
00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:54.599
Moderator: Let's see what? Oh, no! It took you back to the beginning.

468
00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:55.410
P9: Yeah.

469
00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:57.300
Moderator: Refresh it.

470
00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:04.130
Moderator: Sorry about that. Okay, I don't want you to have to go back through the entire form.

471
00:36:05.384 --> 00:36:10.200
Moderator: Well, let's see if you started. If it has saved anything that you entered.

472
00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:14.060
P9: No.

473
00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:16.900
P9: and that's something, too.

474
00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:21.140
P9: That maybe should be added is

475
00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:25.319
P9: continue, or save for later.

476
00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:34.280
P9: So at the bottom, where it says back or continue. Maybe there should be save for later.

477
00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:41.360
Moderator: Yeah. Do you think that you would want to save this form and come back to it later.

478
00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:51.319
P9: It depends on the timing, because if you come in and let's say you think it's gonna take like 20 min. But then, if you need troubleshooting

479
00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:55.240
P9: and you have to make a phone call or

480
00:36:55.330 --> 00:36:58.820
P9: ask some questions, I think it would be great

481
00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:03.560
P9: to have that on here. So it says back. Continue.

482
00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:05.270
P9: You could do

483
00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:06.660
P9: save

484
00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:10.040
P9: maybe put

485
00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:11.320
P9: back.

486
00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:16.150
P9: Save then continue because you don't want to continue until you've saved it.

487
00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:19.750
Moderator: Yeah, okay, thank you for that. It's helpful.

488
00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:30.289
Moderator: let me just see if I can get an example of the one screen that we didn't get to, because I don't wanna make you go back there.

489
00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:46.230
Moderator: Sorry one moment.

490
00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:47.100
P9: No worries.

491
00:38:03.946 --> 00:38:10.249
Moderator: You can actually stop sharing your screen, I think, for this last part I'll share mine and have you look at it.

492
00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:10.900
P9: Okay.

493
00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:14.740
P9: Great.

494
00:38:16.810 --> 00:38:18.790
Moderator: Moment while it's loading. Okay?

495
00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:22.569
Moderator: So let's share.

496
00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:35.660
Moderator: Okay. So we were almost all the way through. This is kind of the last page that you would have seen if we from there as like size for Mobile, though, so I'll zoom in a little bit.

497
00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:37.420
P9: So.

498
00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:39.880
Moderator: This is where you would have come after that.

499
00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:50.240
Moderator: So just tell me any thoughts you're having about this page. And what you would expect

500
00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:51.869
Moderator: to happen next.

501
00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:54.056
P9: So would

502
00:38:56.930 --> 00:39:00.089
P9: if I clicked on these arrows, would

503
00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:04.280
P9: all the information that I submitted be in here.

504
00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:06.859
Moderator: Yeah, is that what you would expect.

505
00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:08.320
P9: Yes.

506
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:12.100
P9: it looks like it's prompting me to.

507
00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:15.972
P9: you know. Go to

508
00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:23.500
P9: each of these and review to make sure it's all set.

509
00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:26.939
P9: and then I see it's asking for

510
00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:36.670
P9: You know, you're saying that this this is the information that I entered. So

511
00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:39.910
P9: that's what it looks like. Can you go up to the top

512
00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:50.880
P9: so it is a little bit confusing because

513
00:39:51.570 --> 00:39:59.239
P9: there's nothing unless can you go up to the very top yeah, I think there needs to be some kind of subcategory

514
00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:01.555
P9: that

515
00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:05.270
P9: maybe review

516
00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:07.370
P9: goes up top

517
00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:12.019
P9: because it there really isn't anything that's telling me what this is all about.

518
00:40:12.350 --> 00:40:16.010
P9: maybe put review of information submitted.

519
00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:19.370
P9: or a review of information.

520
00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:27.109
P9: I'm trying to think of a a better word.

521
00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:31.800
P9: You know what I'm saying? There, there really is no prompt here.

522
00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:34.990
Moderator: I gotcha

523
00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:38.020
Moderator: just going back to.

524
00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:38.740
P9: Yeah.

525
00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:41.630
Moderator: Really show us more, because I'm having trouble with the pro.

526
00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:43.243
P9: Yeah, so

527
00:40:45.690 --> 00:40:47.440
P9: there should be.

528
00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:53.220
P9: Again, we want the site to talk to the user.

529
00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:55.630
P9: Now, we're gonna review

530
00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:57.930
P9: what was provided.

531
00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:00.830
P9: Please do that

532
00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:03.090
P9: before it's submitted.

533
00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:07.980
P9: So maybe that paragraph goes up top.

534
00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:12.289
Moderator: Okay, thank you. That's helpful.

535
00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:20.689
Moderator: So once you've done that, I'm going to scroll down a little further, show you what else is on the page. Let me know any impressions that you have.

536
00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:22.050
Moderator: Nope.

537
00:41:22.050 --> 00:41:24.980
P9: That looks like something that would, you know.

538
00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:29.369
P9: need to be there, especially with the privacy policy

539
00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:33.075
P9: yeah, that looks

540
00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:36.610
P9: straightforward.

541
00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:38.920
Moderator: Okay.

542
00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:44.650
P9: Same thing

543
00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:47.799
P9: that looks straightforward.

544
00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:49.330
Moderator: Okay.

545
00:41:50.130 --> 00:41:53.570
P9: But again, the the prompt at the top of the page

546
00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:57.629
P9: needs to include what's gonna happen on that page.

547
00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:00.000
Moderator: Okay.

548
00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:06.389
Moderator: just gonna keep scrolling to show you what else is on the page.

549
00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:12.410
P9: Okay.

550
00:42:17.365 --> 00:42:18.279
P9: and

551
00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:21.940
P9: there may be

552
00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:26.239
P9: one prompt before submit.

553
00:42:28.343 --> 00:42:32.959
P9: And I don't know if it comes on this page, or it comes before it gets to this page.

554
00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:37.200
P9: But is there anything that needs to be edited?

555
00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:39.620
P9: They need to have the option

556
00:42:39.970 --> 00:42:43.849
P9: to edit information before they move to the next section.

557
00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:44.860
Moderator: Yeah.

558
00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:48.400
P9: Because you could put in the wrong postal code you could.

559
00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:53.329
P9: It's easy to think you have everything

560
00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:57.590
P9: and then have to go back. So there's got to be

561
00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:01.440
P9: edit.

562
00:43:02.350 --> 00:43:06.020
P9: save save, you know, save for later.

563
00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:08.239
P9: save and continue

564
00:43:08.370 --> 00:43:10.809
P9: because I don't think that

565
00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:12.020
P9: you know

566
00:43:13.410 --> 00:43:18.410
P9: most people that sit down to do these kinds of documents.

567
00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:21.566
P9: you know. Let's say

568
00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:25.499
P9: It says, you know, this takes approximately

569
00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:28.520
P9: 30 min to complete.

570
00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:33.410
P9: depending again on the language barriers or

571
00:43:34.221 --> 00:43:39.429
P9: the vision barriers. I just think that people need to be given the option

572
00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:44.419
P9: to correct something and edit something, because it's an important document.

573
00:43:45.690 --> 00:43:50.210
Moderator: Yeah, definitely. So how do you think you would edit anything if you came to this page?

574
00:43:51.350 --> 00:43:54.631
P9: I think I would ask the question

575
00:43:55.970 --> 00:43:59.080
P9: before they're submitting it.

576
00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:05.140
P9: There should be a section that says, You know.

577
00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:08.121
P9: do you need to edit

578
00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:12.470
P9: But I think each page should have that

579
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:17.854
P9: at the end, you know, kind of like that front before you continue.

580
00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:20.550
P9: Is there anything that

581
00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:25.829
P9: needs to be changed like it? It honestly needs to be asked

582
00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:32.600
P9: otherwise, what just happened in the session going back to the very 1st page

583
00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:36.850
P9: could happen to people, and then they get frustrated and.

584
00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:40.530
Moderator: Okay, thank you. That's helpful.

585
00:44:41.036 --> 00:44:48.880
Moderator: What would your comfort level be of filling out and signing all this information without all the people who are involved present.

586
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:50.740
P9: The same.

587
00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:57.839
Moderator: You're the primary caregiver as you are. But the veteran might not be here, and the secondary caregiver might not be here.

588
00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:02.879
P9: I think, as the primary. You have that responsibility

589
00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:05.409
P9: and dealing with

590
00:45:05.770 --> 00:45:09.720
P9: family members, and they know that the primary

591
00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:12.490
P9: has that authority

592
00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:16.230
P9: for the family. So it's fine.

593
00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:17.420
Moderator: Okay.

594
00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:24.449
Moderator: good to know. Thank you so much. Now, I'm just going to share the final page.

595
00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:26.350
P9: Boy that went fast.

596
00:45:30.010 --> 00:45:33.040
Moderator: Alright. Let me share this with you.

597
00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:52.829
Moderator: Okay, so if we did submit the application, this is what we would see next. So just describe to me in your own words what this page is telling you happened, and what comes next in the process.

598
00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:55.790
Moderator: feel free.

599
00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:59.509
P9: So it looks like it's

600
00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:02.889
P9: it's giving you all the information. But

601
00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:09.150
P9: it's a little confusing, because it it also says Apply. So

602
00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:11.220
P9: I think I would put

603
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:15.309
P9: the thank you and the submission information

604
00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:17.370
P9: above

605
00:46:17.895 --> 00:46:21.059
P9: and have a prompt on here that says

606
00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:23.100
P9: application.

607
00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:26.110
P9: completion.

608
00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:28.829
P9: You know something that says you're done.

609
00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:33.649
P9: and then here are next steps. But it's it's kind of looking like.

610
00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:38.160
P9: apply that prompt is.

611
00:46:38.290 --> 00:46:42.530
P9: do. Did I forget something? Do I need to do something again?

612
00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:43.570
Moderator: Okay.

613
00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:48.019
P9: So that's confusing that that only gets a 3.

614
00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:49.230
Moderator: Okay.

615
00:46:50.350 --> 00:46:53.700
Moderator: and I'll just scroll down the page. You can see everything that's on it.

616
00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:01.919
Moderator: Is there anything that you would like to see here that you don't.

617
00:47:04.510 --> 00:47:07.760
P9: those sub headers, I think could be

618
00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:13.630
P9: in, you know, colors, that sort of match the blue and green

619
00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:17.989
P9: Or something that just comes out to people

620
00:47:18.430 --> 00:47:23.700
P9: cause they're important what to expect next, what to do if you have questions.

621
00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:25.939
P9: what if you're denied?

622
00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:30.320
P9: So I think this page needs some attention.

623
00:47:31.290 --> 00:47:32.010
Moderator: Okay.

624
00:47:33.715 --> 00:47:40.300
Moderator: Is there any information that you would want to know after submitting the application, that you don't see.

625
00:47:41.130 --> 00:47:47.019
P9: So I'm looking to see if there's a timeline you'll receive a confirmation.

626
00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:49.170
P9: But

627
00:47:49.650 --> 00:47:52.150
P9: it's not really saying.

628
00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:58.580
P9: you know. Is it? Within 10 business days, is it within.

629
00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:02.340
P9: you know, 15 business days.

630
00:48:03.226 --> 00:48:08.399
P9: or all applications reviewed once they're received, and

631
00:48:08.730 --> 00:48:14.349
P9: 2 weeks after that. So I think there needs to be more information built in

632
00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:16.880
P9: on expectations.

633
00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:19.130
Moderator: okay.

634
00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:21.589
Moderator: thank you. That's helpful.

635
00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:25.130
Moderator: Any other feedback about this page.

636
00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:34.399
P9: The font looks small, and I'm not sure if that's just your screen.

637
00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:38.239
P9: The font on the other pages did not look. Yeah, that's better.

638
00:48:39.590 --> 00:48:40.710
P9: That's much better.

639
00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:50.790
Moderator: Okay. Any other feedback.

640
00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:54.067
P9: No, again. It's

641
00:48:56.650 --> 00:49:00.579
P9: You know. The subcategories, I think, need to be outlined more in.

642
00:49:01.150 --> 00:49:03.070
P9: You need to have timelines

643
00:49:03.868 --> 00:49:07.060
P9: built into this. I just had a question.

644
00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:09.160
P9: when.

645
00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:13.169
P9: as you folks are designing this for the users.

646
00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:16.340
P9: how long do you anticipate

647
00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:19.260
P9: the average time is to complete.

648
00:49:21.210 --> 00:49:24.159
Moderator: Complete the form per user, you mean.

649
00:49:24.941 --> 00:49:33.140
Moderator: so usually have what we always have to have actually some guidelines at the start of the form.

650
00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:36.360
Moderator: Which

651
00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:41.519
Moderator: we looked@togetherfirstst So it was.

652
00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:45.349
Moderator: I'll just share it real quick. So you can see.

653
00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:09.360
Moderator: okay. So like, when the user is starting a form. This is actually something that is required of us is to put the respondent burden of approximately how long

654
00:50:09.810 --> 00:50:12.040
Moderator: the form should take to fill out.

655
00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:17.110
Moderator: Do you think that that's accurate, based on what you've seen in the form.

656
00:50:17.110 --> 00:50:18.557
P9: No, I think

657
00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:24.379
P9: I would probably increase it by 20 to like 20,

658
00:50:24.650 --> 00:50:27.609
P9: cause. Then they'll be happy if they finish it sooner.

659
00:50:28.615 --> 00:50:29.170
Moderator: Okay.

660
00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:33.689
Moderator: any other feedback.

661
00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:35.080
Moderator: I'm sure.

662
00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:37.120
P9: No

663
00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:40.930
P9: It's just again having

664
00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:44.980
P9: the prompts really talk to the user

665
00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:49.670
P9: and having them stand out.

666
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:53.769
P9: And if you know, putting ourselves in the.

667
00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:57.650
P9: You know, the seat of the user.

668
00:50:58.330 --> 00:51:04.990
P9: you know, coming with the people can come with vision issues. They can come with language barriers. They can.

669
00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:11.550
P9: you know, make a mistake, and they have to edit. So I think you need to give opportunity for

670
00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:12.990
P9: all of that

671
00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:16.540
P9: to you know.

672
00:51:16.690 --> 00:51:18.580
P9: be available for the user.

673
00:51:19.150 --> 00:51:20.819
Moderator: Yeah, thank you so much.

674
00:51:21.205 --> 00:51:25.490
Moderator: So we are almost done. I just have a couple of final questions for you.

675
00:51:25.776 --> 00:51:32.430
Moderator: Now that you've seen the form. What research do you think that you would want to do before applying and completing a form like that?

676
00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:36.393
P9: I would definitely go to

677
00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:40.820
P9: to the Va website to the Caregiver website.

678
00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:42.791
P9: I know I have.

679
00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:50.459
P9: I mentioned earlier that I have in my history and in my favorites.

680
00:51:50.770 --> 00:51:55.120
P9: you know, different va.gov websites.

681
00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:58.159
P9: So I would definitely go

682
00:51:58.270 --> 00:52:01.539
P9: and just make sure that I understand.

683
00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:08.210
P9: you know a little bit more about the website. There may be

684
00:52:08.580 --> 00:52:12.610
P9: a way to actually look up the website before you start it.

685
00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:16.290
P9: because it looks like once you get into the application.

686
00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:17.430
P9: you're

687
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:19.219
P9: you're in it.

688
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:25.100
P9: So I I probably would spend a couple of minutes

689
00:52:26.090 --> 00:52:27.340
P9: trying to

690
00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:30.430
P9: gather a little bit of info.

691
00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:31.600
Moderator: Okay.

692
00:52:32.844 --> 00:52:40.809
Moderator: and what were your thoughts about the amount of information that was provided in the form? Did you think it was too much, too little, or just enough.

693
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:44.800
P9: You know.

694
00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:48.940
P9: it's a good question, because you would think that a lot of the

695
00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:53.449
P9: you know the primary caregivers would

696
00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:55.950
P9: know why they're

697
00:52:56.890 --> 00:53:03.189
P9: filling out this form and that they'd be knowledgeable. But you could have links

698
00:53:04.450 --> 00:53:06.370
P9: beforehand

699
00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:09.020
P9: on the main page, like.

700
00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:10.730
P9: you know.

701
00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:18.780
P9: Find out if you're eligible, or you know, some of those prompts were there, but maybe a little bit brighter.

702
00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:20.820
P9: so that people can.

703
00:53:20.980 --> 00:53:22.910
P9: Some people are gonna come in

704
00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:29.600
P9: with ability to just get through the application and and go. Some people are gonna come in.

705
00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:34.080
P9: maybe not having that background

706
00:53:34.730 --> 00:53:37.939
P9: on the caregiver program. So you know.

707
00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:39.960
P9: maybe some

708
00:53:40.730 --> 00:53:42.870
P9: pre resources.

709
00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:47.109
P9: kind of saying, before you begin this application.

710
00:53:47.140 --> 00:53:51.050
P9: feel free to do some general research at the

711
00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:52.760
P9: I know I use a

712
00:53:52.770 --> 00:53:56.229
P9: I told you earlier, the va.gov website?

713
00:53:58.610 --> 00:54:03.159
P9: so people could could go there and just ask questions.

714
00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:08.279
P9: A lot of people are going to AI now and asking questions.

715
00:54:08.829 --> 00:54:13.859
P9: So I think there's ways to to find information before people get

716
00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:16.239
P9: too far into the application.

717
00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:17.410
Moderator: Okay.

718
00:54:17.970 --> 00:54:20.140
Moderator: so did you feel like

719
00:54:21.810 --> 00:54:24.800
Moderator: it's just enough if there's more links provided upfront.

720
00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:26.590
P9: Yes, yes.

721
00:54:26.590 --> 00:54:27.350
Moderator: Okay.

722
00:54:27.700 --> 00:54:35.949
Moderator: Alright, thank you. Is there any additional information about who qualifies to be a primary or secondary caregiver that you would like to see.

723
00:54:39.130 --> 00:54:43.040
P9: You know, I I think I know, just because

724
00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:47.560
P9: of my role. But there could be a link to that, too.

725
00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:53.450
P9: you know. Description of primary caregiver description of, you know.

726
00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:55.689
P9: secondary caregiver.

727
00:54:57.070 --> 00:55:01.999
P9: More information can't hurt. It's just a matter of how it's laid out

728
00:55:03.110 --> 00:55:06.100
P9: and how easy it is for people to access.

729
00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:08.630
Moderator: Okay, thank you so much.

730
00:55:09.075 --> 00:55:18.840
Moderator: So I just want to circle back and reconfirm. Are you comfortable? If we were to share a video clip of this session with our Va partners removing any identifying information.

731
00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:19.960
P9: Yes.

732
00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:24.549
Moderator: Okay, is there any part of our discussion you would not want shared in a video clip.

733
00:55:24.830 --> 00:55:26.510
P9: Not at all. I'm happy to help.

734
00:55:26.930 --> 00:55:38.480
Moderator: Okay, thank you. We really appreciate you taking the time to give us your feedback. It's really helpful. So we continue to work on the site. Make sure it's really working for all veterans and caregivers.

735
00:55:38.924 --> 00:55:41.610
Moderator: Did you have any questions for me before we wrap up.

736
00:55:41.610 --> 00:55:48.590
P9: No, not at all. Anytime. You folks need assistance. I'm happy to share my expertise and help out.

737
00:55:48.940 --> 00:56:05.339
Moderator: Okay, thank you. Lastly, Perigin is the company that sent you the invite for this session. They'll be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb, that you could pass along to veterans and caregivers if you know anyone who might want to participate in research studies like this.

738
00:56:05.590 --> 00:56:06.809
P9: Okay. Great.

739
00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:09.059
Moderator: Great. Thank you so much, Stephanie. I hope you have a great.

740
00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:12.990
P9: You have a great Friday. Okay, bye, bye.

741
00:56:12.990 --> 00:56:13.580
Moderator: Bye.
