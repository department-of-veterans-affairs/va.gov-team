Moderator: Yeah.

2
00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:05.970
Moderator: okay.

3
00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:12.450
Moderator: So I've started recording just to confirm, are you comfortable? If I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

4
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.350
P25: Yes.

5
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:21.420
Moderator: And are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other Va partners, and we'll remove any identifiable information.

6
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.325
P25: Yes.

7
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.050
Moderator: Okay, got through that intro.

8
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:30.400
Moderator: So before we start and look at the caregiver program online form, I have a few warm-up questions.

9
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:38.319
Moderator: Can you confirm that you? Are you enrolled? Or have you ever applied for the program of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers in the past?

10
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.744
P25: I have, I have not.

11
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.380
Moderator: Okay. Have you ever heard of that program before.

12
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.430
P25: I have.

13
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.019
Moderator: Yeah, can you just kind of tell me what it is in your own words?

14
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:56.940
P25: It's where a veteran who is at a point in his life that he needs assistance with his daily needs.

15
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.059
P25: and they differ.

16
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:11.399
P25: depending on the veteran you have sighted veterans versus blinded veterans. The need is totally different, and the question should be totally different. For a blind veteran versus a sighted veteran.

17
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.299
Moderator: Got it. Thank you for explaining that.

18
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.259
Moderator: Have you ever interacted with the Va. For other family benefits before.

19
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:21.660
P25: I have.

20
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:23.080
Moderator: Okay.

21
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.829
Moderator: Can you explain to me in your own words a little bit more what it means to be a caregiver.

22
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:41.309
P25: Someone that looks out for the needs of a veteran on a daily basis, things that he himself, he or she himself cannot do. Physically.

23
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.100
Moderator: Got it.

24
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.840
Moderator: Okay?

25
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.240
Moderator: And how would you like to learn more about caregiver programs and benefits? Your family members may qualify for.

26
00:01:52.438 --> 00:02:00.100
P25: I would, and I would. I would hope the program has expanded to include the blind veterans that I've been talking about.

27
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.740
Moderator: Is there a certain way you would like to be informed about

28
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.969
Moderator: kind of what's available? Or if anything changes.

29
00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:23.899
P25: by email, because most of the correspondence coming to Va. Still not living up to what should be doing for a visual impaired veterans. It's not sending it to us in alternative format. So email will probably be the best way.

30
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.864
Moderator: Got it. Yeah, thank you for explaining that.

31
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.590
Moderator: Okay. So now we're going to shift gears a bit. And I'm going to share the testing site with you.

32
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:41.530
Moderator: I'll put it in zoom chat, I think, Pergian said. They also may have just sent you an email a few minutes ago with it so, whatever way is easiest for you.

33
00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.889
P25: I would have to leave. Yeah, go if you could. Just bring it up, probably easier.

34
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.259
P25: If not, then I'll go try to find an email.

35
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:58.349
Moderator: I put it in chat if you can get to it, because we really like to see you use it on your device with your technology. So we can see how that works.

36
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.090
P25: Okay, well, hold on. Let me go find the email.

37
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.650
Moderator: Yeah.

38
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:03.370
Moderator: Now take your time.

39
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.360
P25: Have a reminder.

40
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.990
Moderator: Yeah, it would have been pretty recent.

41
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.770
Moderator: they said. They just sent it in the last 15 min.

42
00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.819
P25: It's the most recent one.

43
00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.189
P25: Instead, she sent an email today.

44
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.780
Moderator: Yeah, it was just within like 15 min ago, and I am checking again, too.

45
00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:36.919
P25: Here we go!

46
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:39.900
P25: Let's see if that's it.

47
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:41.669
Moderator: Did you find it?

48
00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.710
P25: Alright! I think I have it here.

49
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.449
P25: I do have it here.

50
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:54.810
Moderator: Awesome. Great.

51
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.709
Moderator: Okay. And now, if you could just share your screen

Moderator: with us and just bring up that

53
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:01.970
Moderator: one link we just shared.

54
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:06.499
P25: Okay. Now, this is where we're gonna have an issue. How do I get to share my screen?

128
00:09:53.450 --> 00:10:04.539

P25: Can y'all see that.

143
00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:31.339
Moderator: It stopped screen sharing. If you could try resetting that again.

144
00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:33.290
P25: Okay.

145
00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:36.080
P25: so that's going back into zoom

146
00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:44.280
P25: one second.

147
00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:52.520
P25: Okay.

148
00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:03.970
P25: so it's the 1st one. You sure it's the 1st one.

149
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.929
Moderator: Yeah, I can't see it. Does it give you a screen

150
00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.270
Moderator: option in that menu?

151
00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:14.599
Moderator: It should be the 1st option, I think.

152
00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:28.650

Moderator: We could also, if you can, you get to it, and at least go through it and kind of

161
00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:21.620
Moderator: I can't hear the audio.

162
00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:22.625
P25: Oh!

163

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:45.600
P25: Can you hear that.

188
00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:47.960
Moderator: I cannot.

189
00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:50.279

195
00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:14.110
Moderator: I faintly did hear something there. For a second.

196

P25: Yeah, I'm gonna use this one. So you got. But I'm gonna use this one so you can hear it.

212
00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:02.749

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:29.390
Moderator: Yeah, we'll see if this works. The echo and the squeal was pretty loud. So.

217
00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:36.059
P25: Yeah, I just let me turn my volume down. See if that works on that.

218
00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:40.230
P25: Okay, that any better.

219
00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:46.410
Moderator: For now, if you need to try logging out of this account, using your other one.

220
00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:49.340
P25: But we're gonna have the same issue

221
00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:49.826
P25: with

222
00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:52.150
P25: you're trying to hear.

223
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:52.960
Moderator: Okay.

224
00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:55.110
P25: Okay. Let's see.

225
00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:09.129
Moderator: I know we have trouble screen sharing. So if you kind of just do your best to like, let your assistive technology speak or kind of let us know what you're doing, since we can't see.

226
00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:10.810
P25: Now a question on that.

227
00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:11.680
P25: I think it's.

228
00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:15.149
Moderator: Stop sharing your audio with us. Again it went dark.

229
00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:17.349
P25: Can you hear me?

230
00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:21.000
Moderator: Yep, I can hear you now, but I can't hear your device.

231
00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:22.823
P25: The

232
00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:34.219
P25: the information about if veteran can the veteran represent himself when he's did that person, as caregiver have to be the one to sign that

233
00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:37.279
P25: if he's still cognitively capable of signing.

234
00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.980
Moderator: Yeah, as you're thinking, that would be the only situation.

235
00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:46.442
P25: I was just wondering because it said,

236
00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:50.569
P25: person doing this will be the one it will get affidavit.

237
00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:53.500
P25: Okay.

238
00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:15.050
Moderator: Please.

239
00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:18.890
Moderator: is the screen, reader, on the other account you're using?

240
00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.260
Moderator: Hey, P25? Can you hear me.

241
00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:02.260
P25: Okay.

242
00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:05.709
Moderator: Can you hear me? Okay.

243
00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:09.189
P25: Yeah, I can hear you alright. I just read down the

244
00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:13.370
P25: directions on the the front of the form. I guess it is.

245
00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:16.199
P25: Tell them what the qualifications

246
00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:20.319
P25: and where someone should do, you know if they eligible?

247
00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:23.689
P25: Did you want me to enter each one of those links.

248
00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:32.020
Moderator: No, you don't have to, if that's not what you would normally do. But I am curious. Would you click on each one of those. If you were doing this

249
00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:33.230
Moderator: for real.

250
00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:41.254
P25: Well, I qualify, so I probably wouldn't. But I cause I know I'm eligible. But I'm not just not ready to.

251
00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:47.669
P25: yeah, I don't know. You call it a macho thing. I still think there's some things I could do on my own where I know I need help.

252
00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:48.750
Moderator: Got it.

253
00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:56.819
Moderator: That's totally fair, I guess. Did anything on that page stand out as being really confusing or really helpful as you went through it?

254
00:22:57.767 --> 00:23:01.580
P25: Helpful. It's giving you the information that you need to verify.

255
00:23:01.957 --> 00:23:06.080
P25: Whether or not you're eligible if you need help, where to go to for the help

256
00:23:07.017 --> 00:23:11.080
P25: the links themselves. They're pretty much self explanatory.

257
00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:16.830
P25: And the question I had about power attorneys, or whether or not the veteran

258
00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:19.140
P25: was capable, signing for himself.

259
00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:23.639
P25: You know that that was a question I had before, you know, dealing with that power of attorney.

260
00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:26.560
Moderator: Got it.

261
00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:30.730
P25: I do know a few people that cognitively they can't do it.

262
00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:34.430
P25: And you know, you got to wonder the people

263
00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:39.679
P25: are they doing the ones that are going to be caregivers? Are they the ones in there for the best interest.

264
00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:43.749
P25: you know? Are they selecting them after the fact, or beforehand.

265
00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:48.360
Moderator: Got it. It's really helpful feedback. Thank you.

266
00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:57.509
Moderator: And a question on that page. You just went over on a scale of one to 5 of one being very poorly, and 5 being very well.

267
00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:02.949
Moderator: How prepared and informed do you feel about the application you're about to begin, and why.

268
00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:08.580
P25: I would say a 4 cause nothing's always

269
00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:19.569
P25: what complete. You know, when that nothing's really 100%. There's always gonna be something that you're gonna find that can be changed. But information wise.

270
00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:20.700
P25: Wow!

271
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:25.010
P25: It's I guess you could call it dummy proof at the moment.

272
00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:26.640
P25: Okay.

273
00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:38.340
Moderator: Now I'm going to have you kind of go through the application. If you were applying. Remember, this is our testing site, so you can use whatever. I'm going to try unmuting your other account because we weren't hearing your screen, reader, last time.

274
00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:42.279
P25: Okay. Well, I turned the volume down on there because of the echo.

275
00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:47.779
Moderator: Yes, hoping we could still hear it with a minimal echo. But let's see if we can.

276
00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:49.229
P25: Raise it up some.

277
00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:57.800
Moderator: I was trying to unmute it, but it won't let me. I think you have to do it.

278
00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:06.080
P25: 96, 96% battery power. The host would like you to. The host would like you to unmute. Stay, muted Button.

279
00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:11.810
Moderator: Little bit of feedback, but I could hear it so.

280
00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:16.659
P25: Call and prompt share, content, stop, unmute my audio audio, now unmuted.

281
00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:21.359
Moderator: If it gets too bad for you, feel free to mute it or turn it down.

282
00:25:21.715 --> 00:25:22.070
Pa Pa P25: But.

283
00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:27.330

284
00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:27.920
Moderator: Yeah.

285
00:25:28.694 --> 00:25:31.789

Moderator: Too much feedback. We couldn't.

Moderator: I'm muted.

312
00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:17.379
Moderator: Okay, that did stop the feedback. But yeah, if you could just go through the form and just try and keep us

313
00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:19.640
Moderator: informed and kind of give us

314
00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:24.040
Moderator: updates. As you move along through each page we'll see if we can.

315
00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:24.940
P25: Right now.

316
00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:26.290
Moderator: Get that to work.

317
00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:27.380
P25: Okay.

P25: let me find a form here.

319
00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:56.689
P25: Okay, start the application

320
00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:05.380
P25: that's

321
00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:15.320
P25: required.

322
00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:21.750
P25: Now, do I have to put my name, or I've used anything? John DOE, whatever.

323
00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:32.329
Moderator: Yeah, it's a test site, so it won't go anywhere. And we were not actually gonna submit it when we get to the end. So, and we can't see. So feel free to use whatever you're comfortable with.

324
00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:39.130
Moderator: But yeah, just kind of keep us updated of

325
00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:42.879
Moderator: what's going on, and any feedback you have at each page.

326
00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:43.900
P25: I'm putting

327
00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:47.883
P25: alright. Can y'all see that.

328
00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:52.649
Moderator: Nope, it didn't screen share unless we wanted to try that again.

329
00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:11.100
Moderator: You could screen share with your secondary account. Now that you open that

330
00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:13.650
Moderator: that would actually be really, really helpful.

331
00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:19.229
P25: I think if you had sent it to me I it would been easier than me. Open it, because

332
00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:20.979
P25: I can't get it to you

333
00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:27.429
P25: cause I'm at the part where you enter the veterans. Information

334
00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:33.170
P25: you wanna try to send it put it up on Zoom.

335
00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:34.849
P25: and I'll do it from there.

336
00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:38.270
Moderator: Yeah, I guess you want me to

337
00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:41.889
Moderator: kind of share a version, and we'll kind of you can do your version.

338
00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:43.729
Moderator: I'm not sure if the.

339
00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.400
P25: If you share.

340
00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:47.699
P25: put it.

341
00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.190
Moderator: Put it in.

342
00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:18.809
Moderator: I did put the link in chat. If your secondary zoom account can get to it now, because it probably wasn't there before.

343
00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:39.680
P25: I have. You

344
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:41.770
P25: shows monitor.

345
00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:43.990
Moderator: Okay.

346
00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:49.120
Moderator: on the other zoom account you're logged in on.

347
00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:53.290
Moderator: Not the one you're the one that's muted. Can you get to

348
00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:57.259
Moderator: the chat and the link from that one and screen share off of that account.

349
00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:01.141
P25: On the other device.

350
00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:08.680
P25: Hope we don't get no echo.

351
00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:14.860
Moderator: Yeah. Just wonder if we could share the device with the other screen and not the sound, and then we could. At least

352
00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:18.960
Moderator: we won't be able to hear the screen, reader, but we could kind of see what you're doing, and

353
00:31:19.290 --> 00:31:20.730
Moderator: as you talk us through it.

354
00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:30.630
P25: Okay, let's see here.

355
00:31:31.543 --> 00:31:34.609
P25: alright, and you sent the form you sent.

356
00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:37.620
Moderator: Yep, it's in the chat again, so you should be able to

357
00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:40.879
Moderator: access it with your other account and open it.

358
00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:49.059

361
00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:02.370
Moderator: Nope, we don't see anything.

362
00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:05.649
P25: The program of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers. Committee number one.

363
00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:06.900
Moderator: Can hear it now.

364
00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:08.160
P25: Okay.

365
00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:12.029
Moderator: Thank you so much for struggling through us with all of this. I know it's not easy with

366
00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:13.340
Moderator: zoom technology.

367
00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:19.510
P25: Of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers.

369
00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:31.536
P25: I'm gonna turn this one off that. We.

370
00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:33.060

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:31.439
Pa Pa P25: Okay. I don't know what happened there just then.

373
00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:35.450
Moderator: You know, it looks like it dropped your other account. So

374
00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:37.429
Moderator: yeah, the device you're on. Now, how about.

375
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:40.319
Pa Pa P25: I had it. Oh, there it is. Okay. Can you hear that?

376
00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:42.960
Moderator: Can't hear that.

377
00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:46.060
Moderator: Can you try screen sharing from this device

378
00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:50.090
Moderator: kind of what we walked through before to just

379
00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:52.059
Moderator: where is it at?

380
00:33:52.751 --> 00:33:56.260
Moderator: Should have that swipe to get to.

381
00:33:56.650 --> 00:33:59.260
Pa Pa P25: I just used the one that you sent in the chat

382
00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:00.520
Pa Pa P25: opened up.

383
00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:04.160
Pa Pa P25: I've got the application open.

384
00:34:05.370 --> 00:34:11.789
Moderator: And then back in zoom you should be able to swipe and find the share content, button and double, tap it.

385
00:34:11.969 --> 00:34:12.789
Pa Pa P25: Okay.

386
00:34:18.649 --> 00:34:19.629
Pa Pa P25: share.

387
00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:37.029
Moderator: Similar zoom broadcast screen.

388
00:34:38.149 --> 00:34:42.929
Moderator: Does it give you the option to say, start broadcast, or share the entire screen.

389
00:34:42.929 --> 00:34:46.349
Pa Pa P25: I already started. It says, start and stop.

390
00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:51.110
Moderator: If you click up to zoom.

391
00:34:51.639 --> 00:34:52.829
Moderator: where'd it go?

392
00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:53.920
Moderator: There you are.

393
00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:04.080
Pa Pa P25: All right. Do I have it?

394
00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:07.429
Moderator: It's not screen sharing.

395
00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:09.259
Pa Pa P25: It's not screen sharing

396
00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:13.020
Pa Pa P25: perfect.

397
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:19.849
Pa Pa P25: Okay? I then hit the share.

398
00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:22.429
Pa Pa P25: and it still doesn't want to screen. Share

399
00:35:22.827 --> 00:35:25.849
Pa Pa P25: it says broadcast, and then freezes the frame.

400
00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:37.009
Moderator: Well, we can kind of go through it then, without screen share. I just thought we'd give it a try on the new device, and just kind of keep going on to.

401
00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:38.180
Pa Pa P25: Alright!

402
00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:43.350
Moderator: Hopefully. We can pick up some of the audio and just kind of talk us through it as much as you can.

403
00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:46.429
Pa Pa P25: All right. 1st part of it's asking veteran information.

404
00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:49.170
Pa Pa P25: personal information.

405
00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:51.829
Pa Pa P25: everything. Star required

406
00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:53.479
Pa Pa P25: 1st name.

407
00:35:53.590 --> 00:35:54.950
Pa Pa P25: middle name.

408
00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:56.740
Pa Pa P25: last name

409
00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:01.249
Pa Pa P25: my suffix. If I have one which I do

410
00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:02.680
Pa Pa P25: date of birth.

411
00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:12.820
Pa Pa P25: so they want January. Whatever is in my case would be October 1, st 1958.

412
00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:21.549
Pa Pa P25: Sex listed at birth. I guess this is for anybody's transgender.

413
00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:29.150
Pa Pa P25: Hold on! Go back.

414
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:33.520
Pa Pa P25: one.

415
00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:39.500
Pa Pa P25: Oh.

416
00:36:52.830 --> 00:36:57.919
Pa Pa P25: now, I didn't put any information in it, can it? Will it continue with a blank.

417
00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:00.570
Moderator: You'll have to put something

418
00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:02.759
Moderator: in there. It won't let you continue.

419
00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:05.470
Moderator: and you can use fake information. But.

420
00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:25.040
Pa Pa P25: That's good.

421
00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:52.090
Pa Pa P25: Alright. Date of birth.

422

Pa Pa P25: okay.

425
00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:02.020
Pa Pa P25: okay.

426
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:04.800
Pa Pa P25: okay.

427
00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:10.420
Moderator: Yeah. Can you tell me what your thoughts are? There.

428
00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:11.819
Pa Pa P25: You've got a wheel

429
00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:14.150
Pa Pa P25: where it has the month

430

Pa Pa P25: going up and down.

431
00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:19.000
Pa Pa P25: Then you got another thing that pops up for data. Buck.

432
00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:25.219
Moderator: Got it. What are your expectations? There.

433
00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:31.780
Pa Pa P25: You know, if it stay consistent, you know, across instead of

Pa Pa P25: you know, you got something. Well, the best way to put it

Pa Pa P25: from

00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:38.890

00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:25.870
Pa Pa P25: alright. You understand what I was saying about the perfect.

444
00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:30.990
Moderator: Yeah, you. You were explaining that you wanted this field to be more consistent with the picker.

445
00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:33.420
Pa Pa P25: Yeah, if it if it stayed like

446
00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:35.510
Pa Pa P25: a wheel. Everything

447
00:39:35.830 --> 00:39:41.329
Pa Pa P25: going from north to south instead of you gotta go down. Well, maybe that's just where the ipad has.

448
00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:43.880
Pa Pa P25: but you know where you could. Just

449
00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:48.879
Pa Pa P25: in this case I will be swiping to find a month if all 30 days just popped up.

450
00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:54.860
Pa Pa P25: and then for the year you had years all there, and they just swipe till they find the one they want.

451
00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.799
Pa Pa P25: and then they double tap on it.

452
00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:02.440
Moderator: Got it. That's really helpful. Thank you for talking through that feedback.

453
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:07.310
Pa Pa P25: Okay.

454
00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:21.880
Pa Pa P25: Okay.

455
00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:32.419
Pa Pa P25: step one of 5.

456
00:40:41.810 --> 00:40:43.470
Pa Pa P25: It's 90

457
00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:16.569
Pa Pa P25: isn't like what I put in there. Huh?

458
00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:22.459
Moderator: Yeah. Are you still on that page with the name and date of birth?

459
00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:26.269
Pa Pa P25: The date of birth. I just made up.

460
00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:30.510
Moderator: Are you still on that same page.

461
00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:34.840
Pa Pa P25: Stand by.

462
00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:41.140
Pa Pa P25: You know

463
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:45.859
Pa Pa P25: that all right.

464
00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:48.410
Pa Pa P25: they really want my social security number in here.

465
00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:53.010
Moderator: Yeah, what are your thoughts on that? Within this application.

466
00:41:54.570 --> 00:41:58.150
Pa Pa P25: It's it's fine. I mean, they should have this already. If you're a veteran.

467
00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:00.269
Pa Pa P25: This is information they should have already.

468
00:42:01.050 --> 00:42:05.493
Pa Pa P25: But I mean for this testing. It's not let me put a fake number in.

469
00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:10.129
Moderator: I can give you one. Let's try 3, 2, 1.

470
00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:11.359
Pa Pa P25: Let me get rid of this.

471
00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:15.220
Pa Pa P25: Okay.

472
00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:17.240
Moderator: 3, 2, 1,

473
00:42:18.850 --> 00:42:21.290
Moderator: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

474
00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:23.840
Pa Pa P25: 4, 5.

475
00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:26.589
Moderator: 6, 7, 8, 9.

476
00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:33.629
Pa Pa P25: Okay, that works.

477
00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:38.130
Moderator: But your expectations was that should have been known.

478
00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:42.380
Pa Pa P25: Yeah. Well, I put 123-45-6789.

479
00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:46.390
Pa Pa P25: Continue

480
00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:01.429
Pa Pa P25: better information, home address.

481
00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:10.800
Pa Pa P25: Any changes to that will only apply to this application. Okay?

482
00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:12.820
Pa Pa P25: So if he moves.

483
00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:14.219
Pa Pa P25: it doesn't matter.

484
00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:18.920
Moderator: Yeah. Can you explain to me your thoughts on that.

485
00:43:20.070 --> 00:43:23.849
Pa Pa P25: I'm assuming. If he's got to move out of his home into his child's home.

486
00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:28.719
Pa Pa P25: this wouldn't apply if he moves into a nursing home or assisted living home, would it.

487
00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:31.999
Moderator: Yeah, would you expect to be able.

488
00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:35.949
Moderator: like, dictate that? Notate that on the application at all?

489
00:43:38.350 --> 00:43:48.079
Pa Pa P25: I would think if it's in a nursing home assisted living probably needs to be put in there, because I don't think you're gonna have a caregiver coming with you into one of them.

490
00:43:49.490 --> 00:43:52.389
Pa Pa P25: especially a nursing home, because they won't take everything.

491
00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:54.970
Pa Pa P25: Okay.

492
00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:59.020
Pa Pa P25: Now, going into a family member's home is a difference. You know.

493
00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:02.900
Pa Pa P25: I can understand that because you're moving in with a child, a sibling

494
00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:05.050
Pa Pa P25: or parent

495
00:44:18.130 --> 00:44:19.300
Pa Pa P25: alright.

496
00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:42.290
Pa Pa P25: straight across.

497
00:44:46.810 --> 00:44:47.463
Pa Pa P25: Oh, my.

498
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.830
Pa Pa P25: no!

499
00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:04.889
Pa Pa P25: Come on.

500
00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:14.199
Pa Pa P25: that's a lot of work.

501
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:18.239
Pa Pa P25: Oh, that might not work.

502
00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:20.400
Pa Pa P25: I don't know zip code for Colorado.

503
00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:31.149
Moderator: Is your you're on the facility. Searching page is your expectation to search by city or state or zip code.

504
00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:34.580
Pa Pa P25: Okay, I got Georgia.

505
00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:36.959
Pa Pa P25: At least I can see. I know that Port zip code.

506
00:46:05.130 --> 00:46:06.080
Pa Pa P25: Skogi.

507
00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:13.130
Pa Pa P25: Okay.

508
00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:15.150
Pa Pa P25: I don't want

509
00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:24.999
Pa Pa P25: what happens for

510
00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:35.540
Pa Pa P25: I'm sorry.

511
00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:39.259
Pa Pa P25: No, I guess it didn't go in. Okay, no. Where were I?

512
00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:39.890
Pa Pa P25: Yeah.

513
00:46:39.890 --> 00:46:42.299
Moderator: Can you talk me through what just happened there.

514
00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:45.670
Pa Pa P25: I thought I put the the county in there.

515
00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:56.770
Pa Pa P25: and

516
00:46:58.002 --> 00:47:00.480
Pa Pa P25: evidently I didn't type it in.

517
00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:17.289
Pa Pa P25: I I thought I put the county in there, and everything. I didn't type it in there, and so where it asked for address and everything. I just use the fictitious one in Columbus, Georgia.

518
00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:21.580
Pa Pa P25: and counties disclose the counties.

519
00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:26.969
Pa Pa P25: I think that was part 3.

520
00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:31.010
Pa Pa P25: Primary phone number.

521
00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:37.400
Pa Pa P25: What if he doesn't have?

522
00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:39.549
Pa Pa P25: Well, he only has one

523
00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:44.906
Pa Pa P25: primary. Okay.

524
00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:51.340
Pa Pa P25: 2,

525
00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:54.080
Pa Pa P25: 3, no.

526
00:47:59.550 --> 00:48:02.222
Pa Pa P25: 3, 3, 1, 1.

527
00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:04.539
Pa Pa P25: My phone should ring.

528
00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:11.180
Pa Pa P25: Okay.

529
00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:21.500
Pa Pa P25: Oh.

530
00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:23.199
Pa Pa P25: how long are you in the field?

531
00:48:23.450 --> 00:48:27.650
Pa Pa P25: Okay, phone number email and alternate phone number.

532
00:48:30.850 --> 00:48:32.660
Moderator: Yeah. Was there something confusing

533
00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:34.260
Moderator: on those questions?

534
00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:36.900
Pa Pa P25: No, that's a self explanatory

535
00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:56.050
Pa Pa P25: now. Alternative phone number, I guess, would be another somebody else's spouse or person caregiver. The number will be in there.

536
00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:05.990
Pa Pa P25: 10 digit.

537
00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:08.170
Pa Pa P25: Oh, yeah, that is pendulum.

538
00:49:20.843 --> 00:49:21.266
Pa Pa P25: Okay?

539
00:49:22.850 --> 00:49:25.699
Pa Pa P25: And what if they don't use the email address?

540
00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:29.290
Pa Pa P25: Will it take it without it?

541
00:49:30.210 --> 00:49:31.710
Moderator: Yeah, is that clear

542
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.899
Moderator: on that page or.

543
00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:39.180
Pa Pa P25: This page is clear. I'm just saying that if they don't use an email address

544
00:49:39.550 --> 00:49:43.190
Pa Pa P25: they don't use email would it still fly without it?

545
00:49:44.290 --> 00:49:47.169
Moderator: Yeah, go ahead and try to keep proceeding with an empty field, and

546
00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:48.740
Moderator: you can see what it does.

547
00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:52.349
Pa Pa P25: No, just no, just the error.

548
00:49:59.770 --> 00:50:00.530
Pa Pa P25: Give me.

549
00:50:17.330 --> 00:50:19.049
Pa Pa P25: Yeah, this is all. Make of me

550
00:50:20.243 --> 00:50:20.806
Pa Pa P25: alright.

551
00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:25.810
Pa Pa P25: Same file.

552
00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:27.365
Pa Pa P25: Oh.

553
00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:31.140
Pa Pa P25: see?

554
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.200
Pa Pa P25: OM.

555
00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:36.600
Pa Pa P25: I see.

556
00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:39.929
Pa Pa P25: Okay, it's good.

557
00:50:47.130 --> 00:50:48.260
Pa Pa P25: Okay? Okay?

558
00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:50.080
Pa Pa P25: Oh.

559
00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:53.510
Pa Pa P25: well, correct. You.

560
00:50:58.670 --> 00:51:00.510
Moderator: Now, can you explain what just happened? There.

561
00:51:00.850 --> 00:51:05.640
Pa Pa P25: The alternative phone number. I didn't put a complete 7 10 digits in there.

562
00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:11.709
Pa Pa P25: and it caught that and said it was an error.

563
00:51:14.430 --> 00:51:14.910
Pa Pa P25: Got it.

564
00:51:14.910 --> 00:51:16.720
Moderator: Thanks for explaining it for us.

565
00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:26.459
Pa Pa P25: Okay, let's see if we go now.

566
00:51:27.845 --> 00:51:30.070
Pa Pa P25: Okay, it went all right.

567
00:51:39.330 --> 00:51:40.920
Pa Pa P25: Which center okay.

568
00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:47.330
Pa Pa P25: Okay. City.

569
00:51:51.690 --> 00:51:53.470
Pa Pa P25: No, I don't use it for that.

570
00:51:58.090 --> 00:52:00.929
Pa Pa P25: That's gonna I assume. That's gonna tell me where

571
00:52:01.130 --> 00:52:02.950
Pa Pa P25: the Va clinic is.

572
00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:11.830
Moderator: Yeah, if you could really provide what's much feedback as you can, or

573
00:52:11.970 --> 00:52:17.039
Moderator: talk through how the voice over is working for, you would be really helpful right now on this one.

574
00:52:18.942 --> 00:52:26.549
Pa Pa P25: Okay, I'm at where the Va clinic, and I guess it's gonna tell me where the clinic is, because it's telling me it's to search the

575
00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:32.280
Pa Pa P25: nearest facility. Okay.

576
00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:42.578
Pa Pa P25: where's the waiting room? Hold on.

577
00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:47.315
Pa Pa P25: Okay.

578
00:52:49.450 --> 00:52:50.939
Pa Pa P25: I better put Georgia.

579
00:52:58.710 --> 00:52:59.450
Pa Pa P25: No.

00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:15.175
Pa Pa P25: No.

584
00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:17.794
Pa Pa P25: How are you?

585
00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:21.710
Pa Pa P25: 1, 9 0

586
00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:23.605
Pa Pa P25: 4.

587
00:53:24.250 --> 00:53:26.630
Pa Pa P25: Search and see if it comes up.

588
00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:29.515
Pa Pa P25: Show me what?

589
00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:44.829
Pa Pa P25: Okay? They gave me the 2 Va clinics in my city

590
00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:47.360
Pa Pa P25: and wait a minute.

591
00:53:48.350 --> 00:53:49.860
Pa Pa P25: Port Moore.

592
00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:54.120
Pa Pa P25: Okay.

593
00:53:58.010 --> 00:54:04.239
Pa Pa P25: okay. So it's giving me all the clinics that are served by Travis.

594
00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:06.210
Pa Pa P25: Central Alabama.

595
00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:09.875
Pa Pa P25: That's a good thing.

596
00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:14.679
Pa Pa P25: Okay? Now, check quarter chef.

597
00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:27.560
Pa Pa P25: Okay, that was

598
00:54:27.770 --> 00:54:29.230
Pa Pa P25: so far payment.

599
00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:34.580
Moderator: Yeah. How did you search for Va facilities?

600
00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:36.710
Pa Pa P25: Say that again if you're talking.

601
00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:40.020
Pa Pa P25: What was the question again.

602
00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:43.990
Moderator: I was wondering how you searched for Va. Facilities. There

603
00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:45.560
Moderator: couldn't see.

604
00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:50.980
Pa Pa P25: It? Asked. It, it. There's a box there and ask for the city

605
00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:53.070
Pa Pa P25: and postal Zip.

606
00:54:53.850 --> 00:55:01.750
Pa Pa P25: so it would tell me the closest va clinic, and what it did. It listed all the ones on the chats

607
00:55:02.830 --> 00:55:04.530
Pa Pa P25: which is Central Alabama.

608
00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:06.519
Pa Pa P25: which I fall under.

609
00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:10.860
Pa Pa P25: and then I selected the one that's pretty much around the corner from me.

610
00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:15.459
Pa Pa P25: and then I hit. Continue

611
00:55:18.030 --> 00:55:20.410
Pa Pa P25: that right. There was paint

612
00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:26.790
Pa Pa P25: a whole lot simpler, trying to go look up the address. It's already there. All you gotta do is put your

613
00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:28.520
Pa Pa P25: city state and zip.

614
00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:31.899
Moderator: Got it.

615
00:55:32.550 --> 00:55:37.139
Moderator: Any other feedback on this part of the form, and how it worked for you, using.

616
00:55:38.975 --> 00:55:41.199
Pa Pa P25: Anything else is that it?

617
00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:45.279
Pa Pa P25: Let's see.

618
00:55:52.380 --> 00:55:57.740
Pa Pa P25: Okay, it's telling me that this is the facility I've selected as a coordinator on staff.

619
00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:01.630
Pa Pa P25: and then

620
00:56:02.610 --> 00:56:07.780
Pa Pa P25: tells me, continue. Now, it's telling me about the coordinators in Montgomery right now. But

621
00:56:09.890 --> 00:56:10.620
Pa Pa P25: right.

622
00:56:24.730 --> 00:56:28.200
Pa Pa P25: I like the fact that you can call somebody if you were having trouble

623
00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:32.460
Pa Pa P25: Awesome.

624
00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:37.590
Pa Pa P25: who also qualifies as a family caregiver.

625
00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:41.200
Moderator: Yeah.

626
00:56:42.020 --> 00:56:45.099
Moderator: what does the term primary caregiver mean to you?

627
00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:49.409
Pa Pa P25: The main person that's taking care of a person.

628
00:56:49.630 --> 00:56:50.799
Pa Pa P25: you know, like

629
00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:52.270
Pa Pa P25: spouse

630
00:56:52.590 --> 00:56:53.650
Pa Pa P25: Trial

631
00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:54.700
Pa Pa P25: parent.

632
00:56:55.980 --> 00:57:10.260
Pa Pa P25: that those would be the main ones unless you got someone else that comes in. If they're single later they don't have any siblings, then it'd be a parent or close relative or friend they appoint as their as their caregiver.

633
00:57:12.035 --> 00:57:15.064
Pa Pa P25: Hopefully they are choosing wise.

634
00:57:17.330 --> 00:57:23.309
Moderator: And if you were completing this application for real, would the primary caregiver be with you to fill this out?

635
00:57:24.350 --> 00:57:25.060
Moderator: Yeah.

636
00:57:27.210 --> 00:57:28.170
Pa Pa P25: Matter of fact.

637
00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:31.799
Pa Pa P25: she would be filling it out, and it wouldn't be in voiceover.

638
00:57:34.710 --> 00:57:38.770
Moderator: Yeah, thank you for explaining that detail. I see. Just kind of hand it over to her to.

639
00:57:39.010 --> 00:57:42.480
Pa Pa P25: I was just like here. You need to fill it out, you know. But you know.

640
00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:45.307
Pa Pa P25: if I was sitting here and and doing it.

641
00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:49.719
Pa Pa P25: Not being able to see this, I could follow this along quite well.

642
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:57.489
Moderator: Okay? Great. Yeah. Let's go ahead and go through a scenario as if we were adding a primary caregiver on this application.

643
00:57:57.780 --> 00:58:00.570
Moderator: And just kind of keep providing feedback like you've been doing.

644
00:58:01.970 --> 00:58:03.620
Pa Pa P25: Okay, there's account.

645
00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:07.630
Pa Pa P25: right?

646
00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:10.432
Pa Pa P25: Only the one primary.

647
00:58:11.530 --> 00:58:12.200
Pa Pa P25: Okay.

648
00:58:18.750 --> 00:58:19.330
Pa Pa P25: yes.

649
00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:28.289
Pa Pa P25: and that's it.

650
00:58:41.260 --> 00:58:42.440
Pa Pa P25: Yes, no.

651
00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:56.460
Pa Pa P25: 1st name.

652
00:59:12.140 --> 00:59:13.240
Pa Pa P25: last name.

653
00:59:19.723 --> 00:59:20.566
Pa Pa P25: Awesome.

654
00:59:28.820 --> 00:59:30.229
Pa Pa P25: Same last name.

655
00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:33.590
Pa Pa P25: I'll suffer

656
00:59:35.470 --> 00:59:36.850
Pa Pa P25: date of birth

657
00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:47.820
Pa Pa P25: and same thing with this date of birth thing.

658
01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:29.585
Pa Pa P25: Alright.

659
01:00:31.413 --> 01:00:32.860
Pa Pa P25: A block.

660
01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:36.490
Pa Pa P25: Oh.

661
01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:43.780
Pa Pa P25: I didn't tell what the relationship was.

662
01:01:07.090 --> 01:01:07.870
Pa Pa P25: Okay.

663
01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:13.270
Pa Pa P25: okay.

664
01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:16.342
Pa Pa P25: what is it

665
01:01:24.090 --> 01:01:26.999
Pa Pa P25: okay? Adding, that person is

666
01:01:27.090 --> 01:01:28.240
Pa Pa P25: fairly comfortable.

667
01:01:28.650 --> 01:01:29.320
Pa Pa P25: Oh.

668
01:01:30.610 --> 01:01:33.010
Moderator: Any other feedback out of that section.

669
01:01:33.550 --> 01:01:38.330
Pa Pa P25: Yeah, I got a question, though. Do they ask anybody to provide

670
01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:40.969
Pa Pa P25: proof that they're related to that person?

671
01:01:41.350 --> 01:01:43.739
Pa Pa P25: If they say that their sister, their wife.

672
01:01:44.250 --> 01:01:45.450
Pa Pa P25: brother, or sister.

673
01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:52.829
Moderator: Yeah, do you expect that to happen as part of this application, or later on.

674
01:01:55.010 --> 01:01:55.790
Pa Pa P25: I would

675
01:01:57.490 --> 01:02:09.209
Pa Pa P25: to help. They say they're married because they could just be living with each other and say, they're, you know, States don't recognize a couple of marriages anymore.

676
01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:15.180
Pa Pa P25: Got it. I was just wondering.

677
01:02:16.010 --> 01:02:18.009
Moderator: No, that's really good feedback. Thank you.

678
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:20.710
Pa Pa P25: Did you?

679
01:02:22.729 --> 01:02:25.240
Pa Pa P25: They want the social security number one from you.

680
01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:32.929
Moderator: Enter in any fake one as long as it's not sequential in order.

681
01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:35.380
Moderator: and I can prompt you with a fake one if you need.

682
01:02:37.370 --> 01:02:40.230
Pa Pa P25: I think if they're gonna be on, they need to have their social security number.

683
01:02:42.330 --> 01:02:45.820
Moderator: What are your expectations around that filling this form out for real?

684
01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:47.330
Moderator: If you were.

685
01:02:54.270 --> 01:02:55.380
Pa Pa P25: Okay.

686
01:02:55.700 --> 01:02:57.130
Pa Pa P25: let's have that number.

687
01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:58.500
Moderator: Okay.

688
01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:00.060
Moderator: 3, 2, 2,

689
01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:02.859
Moderator: 4, 5,

690
01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:04.260
Moderator: 6, 7,

691
01:03:04.370 --> 01:03:05.510
Moderator: 8, 9.

692
01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:11.315
Pa Pa P25: Any.

693
01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:28.060
Pa Pa P25: Okay, that explains why they need in case they don't want to give it up. It says there! Why, they need that and everything. But if they're gonna get paid they should provide this information.

694
01:03:29.290 --> 01:03:29.730
Pa Pa P25: Alright.

695
01:03:41.370 --> 01:03:42.415
Pa Pa P25: Okay.

696
01:03:46.410 --> 01:03:47.430
Pa Pa P25: Oh, God!

697
01:03:50.130 --> 01:03:52.569
Pa Pa P25: Your same address as veteran.

698
01:04:15.860 --> 01:04:23.703
Pa Pa P25: Okay? And the information asked for the primary care is address. I just made it as it's the same as the veteran.

699
01:04:48.190 --> 01:04:48.669
Pa Pa P25: You too

700
01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:03.600
Pa Pa P25: perfect.

701
01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:05.580
Pa Pa P25: Hello!

702
01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:07.733
Pa Pa P25: 6, 5.

703
01:05:09.090 --> 01:05:09.529
Pa Pa P25: Oh.

704
01:05:10.930 --> 01:05:12.099
Pa Pa P25: make a number

705
01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:01.630
Pa Pa P25: chat you with

706
01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:04.670
Pa Pa P25: secondary.

707
01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:09.840
Moderator: Yeah, I'm curious. What does a secondary caregiver mean to you?

708
01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:15.640
Pa Pa P25: I guess you would talk. I would consider, maybe in my case, one of my kids

709
01:06:16.210 --> 01:06:19.110
Pa Pa P25: or my sister if it wasn't my wife.

710
01:06:19.908 --> 01:06:24.029
Pa Pa P25: My mother's a little bit too old long in the tooth to be doing. Take care of me.

711
01:06:25.406 --> 01:06:28.023
Pa Pa P25: So one of my kids, or

712
01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:31.349
Pa Pa P25: yeah, that's about it.

713
01:06:31.370 --> 01:06:32.790
Pa Pa P25: you know, Grandkid.

714
01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.910
Pa Pa P25: if they were doing it on a close relative or friend.

715
01:06:37.850 --> 01:06:38.830
Pa Pa P25: Okay, okay.

716
01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:40.230
Moderator: Do you think?

717
01:06:40.550 --> 01:06:44.240
Pa Pa P25: You're gonna do one of them working at a time. Correct.

718
01:06:45.830 --> 01:06:50.190
Moderator: Yeah, I guess I was wondering, how does you think the secondary role differs

719
01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:55.100
Moderator: in the primary from the primary caregiver as far as process and the benefits that they get.

720
01:06:55.590 --> 01:06:56.970
Pa Pa P25: Well.

721
01:06:57.110 --> 01:07:00.007
Pa Pa P25: anybody has had a family member that's had

722
01:07:00.430 --> 01:07:02.765
Pa Pa P25: it's autistic or

723
01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:14.500
Pa Pa P25: has dementia or anything they need a break. And caregiver is gonna need breaks to get away from the veteran. They, you know, you're under them. 24, 0, 7.

724
01:07:14.890 --> 01:07:18.310
Pa Pa P25: And there's gonna be a burnout factor right there for that.

725
01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:19.850
Pa Pa P25: So they need

726
01:07:20.710 --> 01:07:22.109
Pa Pa P25: vacation time.

727
01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:24.509
Pa Pa P25: so somebody else can come in and

728
01:07:25.030 --> 01:07:27.980
Pa Pa P25: watch them or assist them.

729
01:07:30.570 --> 01:07:38.549
Moderator: Got it. Thank you for that feedback, and we won't actually go through adding a secondary one today. So you can answer no on this question. But

730
01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:47.470
Moderator: I am curious. If you're completing this online form for real, would the secondary caregiver be with you as you filled this out like you reported, the primary would.

731
01:07:49.250 --> 01:07:54.750
Pa Pa P25: I would I would want them to be somewhere where they can have their input to it.

732
01:07:57.190 --> 01:08:01.460
Moderator: So would you prefer to sit down and complete this form together if you were doing it for real.

733
01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:07.369
Pa Pa P25: Yeah, that way. I know they they want to do it. I don't want to put someone in there. That's

734
01:08:07.790 --> 01:08:10.219
Pa Pa P25: you know, my, my siblings are.

735
01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:11.940
Pa Pa P25: They're in other states.

736
01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:14.310
Pa Pa P25: and so are my kids.

737
01:08:14.650 --> 01:08:15.370
Pa Pa P25: So

738
01:08:16.293 --> 01:08:23.179
Pa Pa P25: a close friend, somebody, I would rather have them there, so they know what they're getting into before I put the name on this.

739
01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:28.810
Moderator: Great feedback. Thank you for explaining that.

740
01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:37.420
Moderator: Yeah, you can not add a secondary caregiver and select no, and then kind of on the next page continue on just providing feedback, and

741
01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:39.990
Moderator: what it means to you on that page.

742
01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:00.160
Pa Pa P25: Application. Speak.

743
01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:37.359
Pa Pa P25: I will. I will be signing for myself.

744
01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:39.960
Pa Pa P25: Okay.

745
01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:43.860
Moderator: Do you have someone who is a legal representative for you?

746
01:09:45.210 --> 01:09:45.899
Pa Pa P25: Oh.

747
01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:52.430
Pa Pa P25: my wife would if I was incapacitated. But there's no legal document saying that

748
01:09:53.010 --> 01:09:55.520
Pa Pa P25: I guess I would have to get a power of attorney.

749
01:09:57.700 --> 01:09:58.410
Pa Pa P25: Got it.

750
01:09:58.690 --> 01:10:05.079
Moderator: That's great feedback. So I guess in your own words, what would you expect to happen next? At this point in the application.

751
01:10:05.650 --> 01:10:07.110
Pa Pa P25: Oh, it's lost my phone.

752
01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:09.169
Pa Pa P25: thanks to my wife.

753
01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:20.370
Pa Pa P25: Yeah.

754
01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:24.260
Pa Pa P25: my thing was signatures on an ipad. How would that work.

755
01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:33.570
Moderator: Yeah, what page are you on now? Within the application.

756
01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:36.090
Pa Pa P25: Excuse me.

757
01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:38.249
Moderator: What page are you on in the application.

758
01:10:38.250 --> 01:10:40.039
Pa Pa P25: The signature, page.

759
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:49.099
Moderator: Okay? Great, yeah. If you could just look this page over and tell me any impressions, thoughts, expectations, that you have.

760
01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:49.525
Pa Pa P25: Okay.

761
01:11:09.190 --> 01:11:10.190
Pa Pa P25: okay.

762
01:11:13.230 --> 01:11:18.700
Pa Pa P25: I like the fact that you want them to upload and prove they have. They authorize

763
01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:22.430
Pa Pa P25: to sign. They have to prove, provide that document. I like that

764
01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:40.590
Pa Pa P25: signing for myself.

765
01:11:41.060 --> 01:11:42.040
Pa Pa P25: Yeah.

766
01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:00.860
Pa Pa P25: everybody feels fine

767
01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:37.040
Pa Pa P25: putting my full name in signature.

768
01:12:58.680 --> 01:12:59.445
Pa Pa P25: Oh.

769
01:13:01.610 --> 01:13:03.760
Pa Pa P25: I forgot what my name was on. There.

770
01:13:09.150 --> 01:13:12.850
Moderator: What's your comfort level with filling out and signing this information

771
01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:15.510
Moderator: without all the people present on this form.

772
01:13:16.150 --> 01:13:17.999
Pa Pa P25: I don't have to do it. Okay.

773
01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:22.659
Pa Pa P25: because I just I forgot where to put as kill P25. Okay.

774
01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:26.093
Pa Pa P25: it it wants my name, but it verified that

775
01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:31.289
Pa Pa P25: cause I was putting my name in there. So this got a match, you know. So that's funny.

776
01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:32.899
Pa Pa P25: It caught me on that one.

777
01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:44.139
Pa Pa P25: Everybody has to sign appropriate section after they review it.

778
01:13:45.110 --> 01:13:48.150
Moderator: Yeah, what are your thoughts and expectations around that.

779
01:13:49.890 --> 01:13:57.330
Pa Pa P25: Well, they need to. This is a federal form. And I'm assuming there's penalties that go along with falsification.

780
01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:03.549
Pa Pa P25: the body that is falsifying one.

781
01:14:05.730 --> 01:14:08.589
Pa Pa P25: Okay, what's this statement of truth?

782
01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:17.110
Pa Pa P25: Okay.

783
01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:32.329
Moderator: Wanna pause you before you get to the end. Don't submit the application. It won't work in their testing site. But

784
01:14:32.460 --> 01:14:33.610
Moderator: let me know. When

785
01:14:33.650 --> 01:14:35.809
Moderator: do you have any other thoughts? And when you get there.

786
01:14:37.570 --> 01:14:38.380
Pa Pa P25: Yeah, if

787
01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:41.810
Pa Pa P25: I don't have a problem, you know, except for

788
01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:44.076
Pa Pa P25: pretty much. The only problem I think,

789
01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:46.520
Pa Pa P25: is to wind you the date of birth.

790
01:14:47.050 --> 01:14:54.309
Pa Pa P25: if they were all the same like the date. No column form you just swipe till you find the one you want.

791
01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:56.550
Pa Pa P25: instead of having to go down and

792
01:14:57.150 --> 01:14:59.010
Pa Pa P25: find the numbers below it.

793
01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:06.209
Pa Pa P25: and if everything popped up at like a wheel, you just click to it just like you would do the birth in the year.

794
01:15:06.710 --> 01:15:10.525
Pa Pa P25: Yeah, I'm trying to remember. Where did I see? There's something I was doing that

795
01:15:11.060 --> 01:15:19.600
Pa Pa P25: when it popped up. The year had the current year, and then you had to swipe down to the year that you were born versus have to find the keypad to type in.

796
01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:25.950
Pa Pa P25: But either one of them works. So I'm thinking where it's at.

797
01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:28.630
Pa Pa P25: No, I

798
01:15:28.700 --> 01:15:35.270
Pa Pa P25: I noticed it wasn't up there on the wheel when, after I did the date, and then went down and found the keyboard.

799
01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:40.550
Moderator: Got it. Thank you for explaining that.

800
01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:45.439
Moderator: What would you expect to happen after submitting

801
01:15:45.530 --> 01:15:49.140
Moderator: this form, this application? What would you expect to see if you hit? Submit.

802
01:15:50.248 --> 01:15:58.579
Pa Pa P25: That I had some kind of confirmation that the form was submitted. That's where it would show up in the email

803
01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:02.760
Pa Pa P25: that your form was submitted and was received on date this date.

804
01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:08.446
Pa Pa P25: and them let me know. It's being processed.

805
01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:20.220
Moderator: Got it. Thank you for talking through that. Well, we're all done using the form today. I would just have a couple more kind of final questions as we wrap up.

806
01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:21.210
Pa Pa P25: Okay.

807
01:16:21.780 --> 01:16:26.190
Moderator: Okay, so what research would you do before applying and completing

808
01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:28.710
Moderator: of application for a program like this?

809
01:16:29.070 --> 01:16:33.009
Pa Pa P25: Whether whether I was eligible or not. Did I meet the qualifications?

810
01:16:34.717 --> 01:16:39.722
Pa Pa P25: Got it just because it's there doesn't mean I meet the qualifications

811
01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:41.960
Pa Pa P25: I know a few people in that.

812
01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:44.969
Pa Pa P25: No, don't meet qualification, but they want to apply.

813
01:16:46.530 --> 01:16:49.730
Moderator: Got it. So you'd really want to know all of that before starting.

814
01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:54.901
Pa Pa P25: Right, but at the same time I would hope that the program itself was

815
01:16:55.700 --> 01:16:59.680
Pa Pa P25: equitable across the board. In the past

816
01:16:59.710 --> 01:17:03.110
Pa Pa P25: caregiver program wasn't equitable to the blind.

817
01:17:04.070 --> 01:17:10.540
Pa Pa P25: The standards that they were using were standards for sighted people and not for blind people.

818
01:17:10.740 --> 01:17:13.160
Pa Pa P25: They didn't make any distinctions.

819
01:17:13.730 --> 01:17:15.300
Pa Pa P25: Now, for example.

820
01:17:15.390 --> 01:17:20.840
Pa Pa P25: a question that was asked of one of my members was, can he put food in his mouth.

821
01:17:22.290 --> 01:17:23.902
Pa Pa P25: or can he?

822
01:17:24.510 --> 01:17:27.410
Pa Pa P25: in case of fire? Can he find his way out

823
01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:32.949
Pa Pa P25: and things like that? And that's not a question that you would be asking a blind person.

824
01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:36.309
Pa Pa P25: because everybody can find their mouth, you know.

825
01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:38.919
Pa Pa P25: unless you can't move your hands or anything

826
01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:47.429
Pa Pa P25: you know the at night, you know there's a fire, you know. Can you determine which way the fire is which way you can escape out.

827
01:17:48.210 --> 01:17:50.040
Pa Pa P25: That's what you should be looking at.

828
01:17:53.220 --> 01:17:54.670
Moderator: Providing that feedback.

829
01:17:55.990 --> 01:18:02.409
Moderator: So I guess, would you complete the form with accredited representative or someone else helping you from the Va.

830
01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:04.310
Moderator: yeah.

831
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:05.290
Pa Pa P25: If I had to.

832
01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:06.320
Pa Pa P25: Yeah.

833
01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:08.569
Moderator: And I guess, why would you prefer to go that route.

834
01:18:11.170 --> 01:18:12.980
Pa Pa P25: in case you don't want to make no errors.

835
01:18:13.110 --> 01:18:15.020
Pa Pa P25: Well, you don't. You don't wanna mess up.

836
01:18:15.550 --> 01:18:17.855
Pa Pa P25: or you wanna make sure that

837
01:18:18.250 --> 01:18:20.699
Pa Pa P25: you are eligible for that.

838
01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:25.810
Pa Pa P25: I know quite a few people that that are eligible for it that should apply for it.

839
01:18:26.367 --> 01:18:31.800
Pa Pa P25: One of the qualifications is being what percentage you are under your disability.

840
01:18:32.405 --> 01:18:35.239
Pa Pa P25: You know they may be under

841
01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:38.729
Pa Pa P25: the numbers that they need, but they do need a caregiver.

842
01:18:40.690 --> 01:18:43.259
Moderator: That's really great feedback. Thanks for sharing that.

843
01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:52.069
Moderator: What are your thoughts on the amount of information provided in this form? Do you think it's too much, just enough, or too little.

844
01:18:52.860 --> 01:18:54.084
Pa Pa P25: I think it was.

845
01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:57.247
Pa Pa P25: right there you were, right on point with it.

846
01:18:58.830 --> 01:19:05.030
Moderator: Is there any additional information about who qualifies as a primary or secondary caregiver that you would have liked to see.

847
01:19:06.106 --> 01:19:08.039
Pa Pa P25: You know I didn't look.

848
01:19:09.460 --> 01:19:12.509
Pa Pa P25: I didn't look at. I didn't look at that part and everything.

849
01:19:15.170 --> 01:19:17.000
Pa Pa P25: Guess I should have looked at that one.

850
01:19:18.410 --> 01:19:20.879
Moderator: Yeah, it seemed like, maybe there was missing information

851
01:19:21.310 --> 01:19:22.439
Moderator: within the form.

852
01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:24.380
Moderator: or just maybe don't remember.

853
01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:28.080
Pa Pa P25: I I never clicked on it to see who qualifies as a caregiver

854
01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:29.220
Pa Pa P25: got it.

855
01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:32.370
Moderator: Okay.

856
01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:37.639
Moderator: did you have any other feedback for us of what we went over today, or any questions for me?

857
01:19:38.666 --> 01:19:39.810
Pa Pa P25: When was it formed?

858
01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.220
Pa Pa P25: Be active.

859
01:19:42.750 --> 01:19:45.500
Moderator: This program you can call it is live.

860
01:19:45.893 --> 01:19:50.220
Pa Pa P25: Know the programs active. But when will this form be effective?

861
01:19:50.990 --> 01:19:52.880
Moderator: This form's out there today, too.

862
01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:55.469
Pa Pa P25: Okay, just like just as it is.

863
01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:56.450
Pa Pa P25: Yep.

864
01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:06.509
Moderator: Hope you broke up there a little bit. Got staticky. But yeah, it is

865
01:20:06.550 --> 01:20:09.619
Moderator: live. And out there today, online on va.gov.

866
01:20:09.970 --> 01:20:10.720
Pa Pa P25: Okay.

867
01:20:14.190 --> 01:20:16.899
Pa Pa P25: My mind to go ahead and find my caregiver.

868
01:20:17.550 --> 01:20:19.480
Pa Pa P25: you know. Make my wife happy.

869
01:20:19.850 --> 01:20:20.510
Moderator: Yeah.

870
01:20:21.530 --> 01:20:30.959
Moderator: okay, so I just want to circle back and reconfirm. Now that we've gone over everything, are you comfortable? If we decide to use a audio clip of the session with any Va partners.

871
01:20:30.970 --> 01:20:33.470
Moderator: We'll remove any identifying information. But.

872
01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:34.500
Pa Pa P25: Yes, I am.

873
01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:46.629
Moderator: Okay, well, that is all we have today. Thank you very much for taking the time to share your thoughts with us today and get through the hurdles of getting the right zoom account set up so you could share. Kind of talked us through what I mean.

874
01:20:46.690 --> 01:20:52.639
Moderator: and your feedback's really helpful as we continue to work and iterate on the site, and for veterans and caregivers.

875
01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:54.089
