00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:09.390
Moderator: Okay, I have started recording. So I'd just like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

2
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:10.520
P33: Yes.

3
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:19.320
Moderator: And are you comfortable if we decided to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other Va partners? If we removed any identifying information.

4
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.249
Moderator: Okay, thank you so much.

5
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.410
Moderator: So before we take a look at that form.

6
00:00:25.838 --> 00:00:29.241
Moderator: I have a couple of questions for you. So

7
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:38.860
Moderator: look at my records. Is it correct that you are enrolled in the program of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers?

8
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.939
P33: And so the Va. You're talking correct.

9
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:46.570
Moderator: Yep.

10
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.889
Moderator: Okay. Is it accurate that you can? You applied over 2 years ago.

11
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.430
P33: Yes.

12
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.430
Moderator: Okay. Any idea about how long ago.

13
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.009
P33: We have about 5.

14
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.129
P33: Let's see if this is 24,

15
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.269
P33: yeah, because it was just before Covid. So it's been about 5 years now.

16
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.869
Moderator: Okay, thank you.

17
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:19.560
Moderator: If you were going to explain the Va. Caregiver program to someone who is interested in enrolling, how would you explain it?

18
00:01:23.377 --> 00:01:27.420
P33: It's a support group that helps you.

19
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.999
P33: gives you some motivational ideas. Is that the right phrase for motivational ideas.

20
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.090
P33: inspirational ideas?

21
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.980
P33: It's a

22
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.810
P33: The biggest part is the support that is, other people like you in the situation that you're in.

23
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:49.490
Moderator: Okay.

24
00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.700
P33: Does that.

25
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.524
P33: There's a word I'm trying to think that's not motivational.

26
00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.330
P33: inspirational supportive.

27
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.349
P33: A support group, I guess, is the best to go with it.

28
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:03.480
Moderator: Okay.

29
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.260
Moderator: Are you the caregiver or the veteran.

30
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.619
P33: I am the caregiver, my wife.

31
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:11.670
Moderator: Gotcha

32
00:02:12.187 --> 00:02:16.579
Moderator: and are you familiar with the concept of a primary or secondary caregiver?

33
00:02:18.668 --> 00:02:21.060
P33: Not 100%.

34
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.140
P33: Would that be somebody that would be helping me

35
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.110
P33: as a secondary? Is that the is that the definition.

36
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.250
Moderator: Is that what you think it would be.

37
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.010
P33: Yeah, that would be somebody that would be helping me to help her.

38
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.120
Moderator: Okay.

39
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:36.909
Moderator: thank you. That's helpful.

40
00:02:37.597 --> 00:02:42.249
Moderator: So from your understanding, you are enrolled as a primary caregiver. Correct.

41
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.320
P33: Yes.

42
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.270
Moderator: Okay?

43
00:02:44.965 --> 00:02:56.930
Moderator: So do you remember how you applied to be the caregiver? If it was an online form or in person at a facility. Do you remember how that process went.

44
00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:07.462
P33: It was it was an online. After we had, we had visited the Va. And we had talked to some people there, and they? The suggestion was to check out this

45
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.910
P33: program and that I could do the do the actual application online.

46
00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.200
P33: So it's kind of initiated at the Va.

47
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.329
P33: But completed at home on the

48
00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.620
P33: on the computer.

49
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.920
Moderator: Gotcha. Okay, thank you.

50
00:03:23.507 --> 00:03:29.660
Moderator: Did you complete that form and any other forms that you needed to do to sign up as a caregiver

51
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:36.760
Moderator: by yourself? Or did you have help from someone like an accredited representative or a Vso or other source.

52
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:47.210
P33: not an accredited. It was my wife. We sat here because it needed some information from her, if I remember right. So we sat here and did it together.

53
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:49.710
Moderator: Gotcha. Okay?

54
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:56.899
Moderator: Is there anything else that you'd like to share about your experience with the caregiver application, good or bad.

55
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.999
P33: It's been a while, but I think it was pretty straightforward and easy

56
00:04:03.526 --> 00:04:09.230
P33: most most of the stuff I've dealt with the Va, when you've gone online to fill something out.

57
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:22.249
P33: I, you said that this is sort of between you and me, it's a whole lot easier to do it online than actually go into the Va. Office sometimes and sit there with a clerk.

58
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:23.420
Moderator: And nothing.

59
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:32.209
P33: So clerks, it's just that. Sometimes it's just a whole lot easier to do the work on online. And this was one of those cases where we just sat down. And

60
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.949
P33: I mean, it's been a few years. But

61
00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.140
P33: no, no issues with the actual form.

62
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.250
Moderator: Okay.

63
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.669
Moderator: what was easier about doing it? Online versus in person.

64
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:52.649
P33: 1st off. We didn't have to have whatever information we're having to dig through, and all that, and we can do it on our own time.

65
00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:59.699
P33: and that's probably the bigger one is that you're on your own time. You're not feeling like you're rushed, or anything like that.

66
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.899
Moderator: Gotcha. Okay, thank you so much.

67
00:05:03.592 --> 00:05:14.210
Moderator: So next we're gonna change gears. And I'm going to share a link with you to our testing site. And then I'm gonna have you share your screen once you've got that open. So

68
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.790
Moderator: I'm going to send you the link

69
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.449
Moderator: in the Zoom chat, and I can help you find that if you need any help.

70
00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.339
Moderator: Okay, I have sent it.

71
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.220
P33: Okay, so click on it.

72
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.760
Moderator: Do you see the link.

73
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:34.360
P33: Yeah.

74
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.689
Moderator: Okay. Great. Yeah. I want you to open that link

75
00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.010
Moderator: in whatever browser you'd like.

76
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:42.589
P33: It disappeared.

77
00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.907
P33: I put the

78
00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:50.890
P33: mouse on top of it, and the link disappeared. Didn't seem to have opened anything.

79
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:52.240
Moderator: Interesting.

80
00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.370
Moderator: Do you see a link anymore or no?

81
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:56.250
P33: No.

82
00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.010
Moderator: Okay. Could send it again.

83
00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.890
P33: Okay, there's the link.

84
00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.920
P33: Alright. Alright. I got something on the right side.

85
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.680
P33: new messages.

86
00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.719
P33: so which the bottom link I should click on. Then

87
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.270
P33: over on the right side of my screen. I've got 2 links that popped up.

88
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.230
Moderator: Okay.

89
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.290
Moderator: yeah, either. Or there's the same link.

90
00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.039
P33: Alright! Now take me away, and it's taken me to a browser.

91
00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:32.220
Moderator: Okay.

92
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.230
P33: Program of comprehensive assistance.

93
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:45.869
Moderator: Perfect. So now I would like you to share your screen with me in zoom. So you have to go back to the zoom window, where you can see me.

94
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.260
P33: Then.

95
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:55.469
Moderator: And then there should be a button at the bottom in the toolbar that has a green arrow pointing upwards, and it says, Share.

96
00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.110
Moderator: do you see that.

97
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:00.550
P33: Bar

98
00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.169
P33: right there.

99
00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.709
P33: Okay, alright, that's the one.

100
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.710
P33: And then click on

101
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:09.520
P33: this.

102
00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:16.430
Moderator: And then it will ask you what you want to share, and you'll want to share that browser with me that has that link open.

103
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.060
P33: Alright! That one!

104
00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.620
Moderator: Yep, perfect.

105
00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:30.440
Moderator: Okay.

106
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:44.530
Moderator: okay, so I'd like you just kind of review this 1st page here and tell me what thoughts you're having about it, and what expectations you have of the form before going ahead and applying

107
00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:45.620
Moderator: cool. Yeah.

108
00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:54.980
P33: Well, the the headline tells you exactly what you're looking at.

109
00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:59.369
P33: Check your eligibility, gather information

110
00:08:06.679 --> 00:08:11.290
P33: I like the fact that it gives you your let's call it the homework

111
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:17.820
P33: beforehand. So you it wants you to gather the information it gives you a little help thing here

112
00:08:18.205 --> 00:08:22.040
P33: before you start all this. So you know what to have on hand

113
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:26.340
P33: before you actually start the process. So you're not having to move too far.

114
00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.460
P33: So you're not having to go run around.

115
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:32.210
Moderator: Okay.

116
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:34.730
P33: Not used to her laptop.

117
00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:36.740
P33: I don't know.

118
00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:40.179
P33: Okay.

119
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.279
P33: get there. There we go.

120
00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:51.680
P33: Okay. Yeah.

121
00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:56.060
P33: Like, it says that that makes it easy enough that it explains real simple

122
00:08:56.914 --> 00:09:00.350
P33: this gives you the help numbers in case you need help with it.

123
00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:02.350
P33: Alright.

124
00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:09.700
P33: And then it's got the little green arrow to say, Start here.

125
00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:12.310
Moderator: Okay.

126
00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:19.200
Moderator: is there anything on this page that stands out to you as being confusing or particularly helpful?

127
00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:29.700
P33: says respondent burden. 15 min. Does that mean? It'll take me 15 min to fill it out.

128
00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.720
Moderator: Is that what you think it means?

129
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:46.579
P33: at 1st myself 15 min, because the 15 min is in bold. So my initial thought was, 15 min was how to how long it'll take to fill it out. But then the word respondent burden

130
00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:49.189
P33: makes it sound like it's a problem.

131
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:49.705
Moderator: Yeah.

132
00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:55.609
P33: I associate the word burden with a problem.

133
00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:03.240
P33: So my next thought is, does burden mean that'll take 15 min to get a hold of somebody.

134
00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:05.060
Moderator: Okay.

135
00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:11.259
P33: But that that one's a little on the confusing side as to whether it means it'll be 15 min to fill it out

136
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.329
P33: or 15 min to talk to somebody.

137
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:16.710
Moderator: Yeah, that's really good feedback.

138
00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:23.839
Moderator: It really means the amount of time it's supposed to take you to do the form. But I agree I hate that terminology.

139
00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:29.670
Moderator: anything else standing out as being confusing or particularly helpful.

140
00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:41.670
P33: It has enough numbers and I'm going to assume that because they're all in blue. If I click on them it'll take me to those

141
00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:43.980
P33: to those sites.

142
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:47.109
P33: Okay? The So

143
00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:49.390
P33: that seems to be.

144
00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:51.960
P33: Oh.

145
00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:06.082
P33: no, it seems I mean, from what I'm reading. It seems to be

146
00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:08.310
P33: very explanative.

147
00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:11.940
Moderator: Okay.

148
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:15.310
P33: Simple, other than other than that one work.

149
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:18.280
P33: Okay.

150
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:31.359
Moderator: Okay, if you were gonna rate this page on a scale of one to 5, 1 being the worst and 5 being the best. How prepared and informed do you feel about the application you're about to begin? Based on this page's content.

151
00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:36.740
P33: Based on the page content. I think I would be pretty well prepared. So I would say, it's a 5

152
00:11:37.378 --> 00:11:45.489
P33: assuming this is all the stuff that's on here is what I do need, that they're not gonna come up with something else later on. Oh, you would need your passport number or something.

153
00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:51.979
P33: Okay, but as far as explaining, explaining everything and in the order.

154
00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:54.629
P33: and in very simple terms.

155
00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:58.069
P33: and easy to follow.

156
00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:01.659
Moderator: Okay. Thank you.

157
00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:04.129
P33: My use of this touch. Pad.

158
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:09.020
Moderator: It's it's like everybody has their setup a little differently.

159
00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.990
P33: I'm a mouse. Person personally.

160
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:13.722
Moderator: Yeah, me, too.

161
00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:16.060
P33: Quit touching it.

162
00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:22.849
P33: like I said, you've got the green button there, so I know I know where to click, to start.

163
00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:28.359
Moderator: Okay. So I'd like you to go ahead and start the form as if you were applying for the program.

164
00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:46.110
Moderator: Okay? So I'm just gonna have you fill out the form as though you were really applying and this is just a reminder. This is just our testing site. So you don't have to worry about any of the information that you enter. Going anywhere.

165
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:54.100
Moderator: You can enter real information, fake information. It doesn't matter. I'll give you a fake social security number to put in when we get there.

166
00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:55.480
P33: There!

167
00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:00.949
Moderator: So just think aloud as you're going. I want to hear about any reactions that you're having.

168
00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:07.740
P33: I'm using. I guess it's her real name, because that's the easiest one to make up

169
00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:10.140
P33: my leg.

170
00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:16.128
P33: I don't think I touched too many letters. But okay, so far so good

171
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:19.610
P33: as far as getting names in it. If I hit

172
00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.890
P33: down a little bit I can get to the rest of the form.

173
00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:25.690
P33: Okay?

174
00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:31.729
P33: And you've got it well marked to say, well, this is required. This is required.

175
00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:37.870
P33: No suffix

176
00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.950
P33: veterans. Date of birth.

177
00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.840
P33: July.

178
00:13:57.410 --> 00:14:07.039
P33: Okay. Then hit continue. That was easy enough. It's all simply laid out like I says, the stuff that you do need. It's it says, as far as the 1st and last name.

179
00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:08.320
Moderator: Okay.

180
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:11.909
P33: And then the social security number. You see, you had a.

181
00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:12.920
Moderator: Yep.

182
00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:15.100
Moderator: you can put 3, 2, 1.

183
00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:19.090
P33: Okay.

184
00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:24.039
Moderator: It's not typing in the field. I think you have to click on the field. Maybe. Okay, 3, 2, 1.

185
00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:25.950
P33: What I'll fit.

186
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:28.800
Moderator: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

187
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:33.659
P33: I don't know.

188
00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:34.520
P33: Dude

189
00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.420
P33: alright. Next page.

190
00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:47.559
P33: What is nice are the pages are short so far.

191
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:53.759
P33: so it's not like I'm scrolling through 40 or 50 lines of information.

192
00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:57.210
Moderator: Okay.

193
00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.010
P33: Take it. Okay, not in the box. That's why

194
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:40.710
P33: try that.

195
00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:42.850
P33: Okay?

196
00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:47.420
P33: And next page, and so far. And then you need up to help stuff at the bottom.

197
00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:52.119
P33: So if I'm having a problem, I can contact somebody for some help.

198
00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:53.420
Moderator: Okay.

199
00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:54.720
P33: Next one.

200
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:05.420
P33: Better contacts. Phone number.

201
00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:24.159
P33: yeah, what's a real phone number? Maybe.

202
00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:29.762
Moderator: It might not take like a sequential number. It could just kind of tell it's fake

203
00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:31.971
Moderator: so random numbers is best.

204
00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:34.160
P33: Okay. Yeah.

205
00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:35.780
Moderator: As long as it's 10. Yeah.

206
00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:37.659
P33: Smart. That's smarter than I am.

207
00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:43.700
P33: Yeah.

208
00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:48.160
P33: Okay. What's the shortest one?

209
00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:50.829
P33: I think this is the shortest one.

210
00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:14.380
P33: alright.

211
00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:15.349
P33: Oh.

212
00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:22.359
P33: oh, I forgot that little sign.

213
00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:25.360
P33: Keep that.

214
00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:27.929
P33: and that's

215
00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:47.159
P33: now we're good, all right

216
00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:51.730
P33: the 8 medical conferences.

217
00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:01.240
P33: Who wants to know the where we go for

218
00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:03.040
P33: services? Right?

219
00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:06.579
Moderator: Is that what you think? It's asking?

220
00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:09.340
P33: Yes.

221
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.799
P33: it's asking what would be a center.

222
00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:13.080
P33: Okay.

223
00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:18.329
Moderator: And how would you prefer to search for a Va. Facility.

224
00:18:20.508 --> 00:18:28.269
P33: A lot of the ones that I've dealt with, where you're applying for something the moment you start to type it in, it doesn't auto fill

225
00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:34.119
P33: so like in this case, when I would start to do the Great Lakes, it would fill in Great Lakes for me

226
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:38.490
P33: as to what they actually use for their address.

227
00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:40.090
Moderator: Okay.

228
00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:44.329
Moderator: you kind of expect that to auto populate while you're typing.

229
00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:45.480
P33: Yeah.

230
00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:46.100
Moderator: Okay.

231
00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:49.549
P33: If I search, there's something come up.

232
00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:53.429
P33: Yeah, it's found one.

233
00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:00.200
P33: Okay.

234
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:05.780
Moderator: Why are you selecting that one.

235
00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:09.090
P33: As it says the Captain Lowell. That's where we go.

236
00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:10.210
Moderator: Okay.

237
00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:11.140
P33: Yeah.

238
00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:19.785
P33: I didn't realize there were so many more below it. But yeah, the the top one that showed up this.

239
00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:27.560
P33: does it say Great Lakes doesn't say Great Lakes on there, but that's the one that we go to is the low, level.

240
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:29.680
P33: level, lovely.

241
00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:31.870
Moderator: Gotcha.

242
00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.639
Moderator: you can keep going.

243
00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:40.036
Moderator: Okay. So

244
00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:48.640
Moderator: If you were to rate that process of selecting the facility on a scale of one to 5 again, one being bad, 5 being the best.

245
00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:50.939
Moderator: How would you rate that process.

246
00:19:51.233 --> 00:20:00.049
P33: Actually, it's pretty easy. So 5. Because I said, I just typed in Great Lakes, and that's why I recognized it, as I don't always call it the level center.

247
00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:09.909
P33: So when I typed in Great Lakes is my understanding, it put the level center as the top one it gave me. I think it was like 5 choices after it.

248
00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:17.100
P33: and some of them I've I've never heard of before, and didn't realize there was a place in Hoffman estates, but

249
00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:29.029
P33: it gave me other places, but it wouldn't. The place that we'd go number one, and I didn't have to, you know, didn't recall it as being love as as being the James Lovell Center

250
00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:33.940
P33: 25, because it did. It did a lot more work for me than I did.

251
00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:35.160
Moderator: Okay.

252
00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:35.920
Moderator: Now.

253
00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:49.519
P33: My next. My next question is this, we're up to page 5. I think it says just out of curiosity. If something came up in the middle of all this, and I had to stop. Is there a way of saving it? And coming back to this point.

254
00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:54.799
P33: do I gotta fill it all out, not knowing how many pages there are going to be eventually.

255
00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:58.719
Moderator: yeah, would you want to be able to do that?

256
00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:07.329
P33: Yeah, if something came up, you know, an emergency that I had to leave, I wouldn't want to leave this on the computer

257
00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:12.110
P33: in case something, you know, let's say the computer battery at night, or something.

258
00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.130
P33: or in this case the dog starts to bark.

259
00:21:16.679 --> 00:21:17.000
Moderator: But.

260
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.535
P33: But if something came up that I had to leave, you know

261
00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:26.659
P33: in the middle of this, and like I says, I'm not sure how many total pages there are.

262
00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:31.720
P33: But sometimes, when you're filling applications out, there's a bar to save for later.

263
00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:36.630
P33: Continue without having to go back to page one.

264
00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:46.069
Moderator: Yeah, there is not a way to do that on this form. And we we're trying to get feedback if people would want that. So that's really helpful. Thank you.

265
00:21:47.356 --> 00:21:51.640
Moderator: What would you do if you wanted to change the facility that you selected.

266
00:21:54.108 --> 00:21:57.390
P33: Can I simply go back? Let's see if there's this thing.

267
00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:58.490
Moderator: Yeah, let's do that.

268
00:21:58.510 --> 00:21:59.999
P33: Go back one step.

269
00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:07.280
P33: Okay. Now, I gotta start all over again, don't I?

270
00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:11.970
P33: That was this facility because it didn't show me, okay, so great Lakes.

271
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:34.279
P33: Okay? So if I simply switch and and click something else, will that will it? Recognize that as my primary place

272
00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:37.240
P33: by just going around.

273
00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:43.040
P33: and then, if I continue, it'll save in that case, Evanston, as my place.

274
00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:46.619
Moderator: Is that what you expect to happen.

275
00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:51.802
P33: Yeah. And then it tells me down here. It tells me what I selected that it

276
00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:54.770
P33: of the place in Evanston, on Dumpster Street.

277
00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:59.680
P33: so that that that works just like I would expect it to work.

278
00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:04.350
Moderator: Okay.

279
00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:14.790
P33: Okay. Now, I got something else here.

280
00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:19.160
P33: So I get the whole page in here.

281
00:23:20.408 --> 00:23:24.559
P33: This is over. You plans to receive treatment.

282
00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:29.909
P33: and then it says, says the second, that my assigned care giver support is at the level center.

283
00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:35.929
P33: so would I have to switch it over here, too, or.

284
00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.410
Moderator: Is that what you think you'd have to do?

285
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:52.460
P33: treatment. This is the facility. Alright. It said that I selected the Evanson Center.

286
00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:55.440
P33: and it says, this is where you

287
00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:57.369
P33: plan to receive

288
00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:04.170
P33: treatment, but it tells me my I'm assigned to the James level. So I don't think I've actually switched facilities yet.

289
00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:10.839
P33: They're still telling me that my primary place is the level center.

290
00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:15.039
Moderator: Okay, so what would you do?

291
00:24:16.487 --> 00:24:19.429
P33: Well, at this point I'd ask you is.

292
00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:21.349
P33: did I actually switch it?

293
00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:27.460
P33: But I don't think I actually switched because it's telling me that I'm assigned to

294
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:31.009
P33: one place, but I'm wanting to go to another.

295
00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:37.810
Moderator: Yeah. So pretend I'm not here, and you are filling this out for real.

296
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:43.879
P33: That's what I would, what I would personally do. I would continue and see what what it, what shows up in the next box.

297
00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:45.789
Moderator: Okay, you can go ahead and do that.

298
00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:54.219
Moderator: So I'm curious what the term primary caregiver means to you.

299
00:24:55.590 --> 00:25:02.620
P33: The primary caregiver would mean the the main person that does the largest percentage of the time.

300
00:25:03.326 --> 00:25:07.463
P33: If there were 2 or 3 of us working on this.

301
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:14.889
P33: Let's say this was my father and me and my wife were taking care of my father.

302
00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:29.294
P33: which one of us was doing the bulk of the work. Let's let's say, situation, because this is probably more accurate a father or mother. Father-in-law lives in the house with

303
00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:41.149
P33: the younger adults. And one of the younger adults is is working a full time job. So one is taking care of the the veteran.

304
00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:44.799
P33: Let's say, 80%, 90% of the time

305
00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:52.880
P33: when the when the one that's working comes home from work. Now they give the other one some relief time and get some, you know, their own downtime.

306
00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:57.319
P33: and that would be why, I would refer to as a secondary care bureau.

307
00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:59.239
Moderator: Okay. Gotcha.

308
00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:07.630
P33: You know, in my case it's me. So I'm the primary secondary, and whatever you know, whatever once follow after it.

309
00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:11.359
P33: it's just, you know a 1 person show type thing here.

310
00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:12.759
P33: But if you have

311
00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:15.039
P33: people, that's a different story.

312
00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:16.780
Moderator: Okay.

313
00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:21.290
Moderator: so let's go through and add you as the primary caregiver.

314
00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.880
P33: I don't know if that was my most go.

315
00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:35.250
P33: Never heard.

316
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.700
P33: Okay, easy enough. It's similar to the

317
00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:54.770
P33: the 1st time the 1st page.

318
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:57.960
P33: August.

319
00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:15.240
P33: That button makes it a whole lot easier.

320
00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:18.610
P33: suppose

321
00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:22.130
P33: okay.

322
00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:35.439
P33: and the same social security as before or.

323
00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:40.309
Moderator: Yeah, you can do that and just enter like one number differently. So we'll do 3, 2, 1,

324
00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:42.509
Moderator: 4, 5, 6,

325
00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:44.840
Moderator: 7, 8, 8.

326
00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:54.470
P33: And then it hides it hides. I didn't notice this before, but it hid the 1st half of the

327
00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:57.860
P33: security number and shows me just my last 4.

328
00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:00.419
P33: So that's a good. That's a good.

329
00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:03.619
P33: That's a good option, though.

330
00:28:07.606 --> 00:28:14.780
P33: Then it auto auto fills my address, says, use this address. So it saves me the hassle of filling everything else out.

331
00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:17.760
P33: and it fills it in for me. That's good, too.

332
00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:19.180
Moderator: Okay.

333
00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:25.090
P33: Yes.

334
00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:31.320
P33: I assume that if if I click no on either of them, I have to fill it in.

335
00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:33.999
P33: If my address was different

336
00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:37.739
P33: than than the veteran. Correct.

337
00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:40.810
Moderator: That what you would expect.

338
00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:43.449
P33: Yeah, that's what I would expect is that if if

339
00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:47.549
P33: if I clicked or didn't click, yes, on the last page.

340
00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:50.919
P33: then I would have to put my address, my actual address in.

341
00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:52.140
Moderator: Okay.

342
00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:57.169
P33: Okay, contact information, more phone numbers. Okay?

343
00:28:57.390 --> 00:29:00.700
P33: And we learned the last time.

344
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:07.700
P33: Okay.

345
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:15.849
P33: now, if I don't have a second number, will it recognize that. Okay, or what? I want a second number for me.

346
00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:19.339
Moderator: What do you expect?

347
00:29:20.032 --> 00:29:23.330
P33: I would expect that it's okay. It wouldn't.

348
00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:27.580
P33: It wouldn't necessarily need a second phone number.

349
00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:29.140
Moderator: Okay.

350
00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:52.859
P33: And put the

351
00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:54.400
P33: but

352
00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:02.630
P33: alright. So this is wants to know if I want to put a secondary in there. Correct.

353
00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:06.810
P33: let's go to secondary family caregiver, applicant information.

354
00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:13.930
P33: So if I had somebody else here like, I said in the other one, if if we were taking care of my father-in-law or my father.

355
00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:17.309
P33: and I could put my wife in here as a secondary.

356
00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:21.630
Moderator: Okay, what does the secondary caregiver mean to you?

357
00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:39.170
P33: Like, I said. It means that if this situation, we had 3 of us here, and one being the veteran, the one doing the bulk of the work is the primary caregiver. The secondary is somebody who is helping me help take care of the veteran.

358
00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:43.959
P33: And so, if it was a father here it'd be, you know.

359
00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:52.399
P33: and I had a and my wife had a full time job, and then when she comes home, she would relieve me, and give give me some help with

360
00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:54.300
P33: with the veteran.

361
00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:55.690
Moderator: Okay.

362
00:30:55.910 --> 00:31:03.340
Moderator: how do you think that the secondary caregiver role differs in the application process and the benefits from the primary caregiver.

363
00:31:04.684 --> 00:31:19.279
P33: Probably no difference at all, as far as signing up, probably the very same information I would expect, and the same way, because my. The sheet that I filled out for me as a primary was pretty much the same

364
00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:22.939
P33: as as enrolling the veteran.

365
00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:26.539
P33: so I would think that the

366
00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:30.649
P33: the secondary would be pretty much the same, the same format.

367
00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:31.850
Moderator: Okay.

368
00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:39.320
Moderator: do you think that the benefits would differ for the secondary caregiver than the primary caregiver.

369
00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:51.050
P33: probably only from the primary, is putting more time and more.

370
00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:59.570
P33: is effort, the right word. But they're they're they're more involved and more in depth on it. So I would think that the primary

371
00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:04.309
P33: benefits would be greater than the secondary. I could be wrong on that. But.

372
00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:06.380
Moderator: Okay.

373
00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:08.719
P33: Usually. That's the way that things happen.

374
00:32:09.890 --> 00:32:10.590
Moderator: Okay.

375
00:32:11.605 --> 00:32:15.389
Moderator: Let's say no to this question just for the sake of time.

376
00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:17.280
Moderator: So we can that part.

377
00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:22.522
P33: Alright review it, and

378
00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:39.649
Moderator: So I have a question about what we've gone through so far. If you were completing this form for real, how would you coordinate. Getting all this information from everyone involved.

379
00:32:40.663 --> 00:32:49.720
P33: In my particular case, I've got it all here only because I've been through so many different things as far as social security cards and all that stuff.

380
00:32:49.840 --> 00:33:02.470
P33: If I had a secondary who was not living here with me then this would be something I would do in person with them because I wouldn't want them emailing me or texting me that information

381
00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:09.960
P33: so hopefully, they're they're not somebody that lives that far away. But I would personally take the old fashioned pen and paper.

382
00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:15.449
P33: get the information from them that I would need, and then bring it back and sit down and fill it out.

383
00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:30.629
P33: or if it's easy enough, if the time time frame is, have them here with me when I'm filling it out, but not doing a thing. We're out, you know, I think a lot of people would jump on the text and say, Hey, text, me, your social security number, or this number.

384
00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:32.565
P33: and it's like,

385
00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:37.720
P33: that's not always bad, but it's not always good to today.

386
00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:45.740
P33: but like I said I would, I would definitely do the pen and paper, if not if I couldn't get them with me sitting next to me when we did this.

387
00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:48.209
Moderator: Okay, Gotcha. Thank you.

388
00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:55.669
Moderator: Alright. So, taking a look at this page, can you describe what it's asking and what it means to you?

389
00:33:56.425 --> 00:34:09.054
P33: This is sort of like that is legal disclaimer the right word it wants me to review. Make sure that everything that I have submitted is correct

390
00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:16.209
P33: and that all the numbers are right. And it just reminds me that it's important that this is all correct.

391
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:19.969
P33: and it gives me a chance here to

392
00:34:20.405 --> 00:34:35.439
P33: the veteran signed for myself or represent. So it gives me the option. In my case. I would click the bottom button, because I'm signing for somebody else versus this being my wife, who's the actual veteran.

393
00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:43.780
P33: So I would click the bottom one. But everything here seems to be quite well worded and easy enough to understand.

394
00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:48.480
P33: And is there a button to review.

395
00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:52.759
Moderator: Is that what you're looking for.

396
00:34:52.909 --> 00:35:02.169
P33: Yes, there was an easy button to review. I have another form that I had to fill out for something else, and every time you wanted to review it. There was a little button

397
00:35:02.209 --> 00:35:06.639
P33: down at the bottom to review what I filled out without. It would show you

398
00:35:06.689 --> 00:35:09.769
P33: what cause it was like a 12 page application.

399
00:35:10.099 --> 00:35:13.449
P33: and so there's quite a bit of information on there.

400
00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:17.970
Moderator: Okay.

401
00:35:17.970 --> 00:35:26.559
P33: We do have this one here where you know I need certain documents, and it tells me what they can't accept. And that's always a good idea, because a lot of people think.

402
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.620
P33: especially if you go to Dmv. I bring this along with

403
00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:38.060
P33: and then you get to. You. Stand in line for the Dnv. For an hour. Then it's like, Wait a second. You got the wrong stuff.

404
00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:44.839
P33: So that's a good thing to have on there to tell me, you know. Don't worry about bringing this because this ain't going to do any good.

405
00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:46.200
P33: Okay.

406
00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:49.270
Moderator: Okay? And what type of document would you upload.

407
00:35:53.740 --> 00:36:11.940
P33: I, personally don't have a problem uploading, because there's some other forms that I've had to fill out for other things on this kind of a thing. So I don't have a problem uploading a picture of my driver's license, a little hesitant about the Social Security card. But I've had to do that.

408
00:36:12.461 --> 00:36:15.880
P33: So as far as uploading me that I you know

409
00:36:16.892 --> 00:36:23.230
P33: I feel pretty safe and secure that I can upload documents, especially to the Va.

410
00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:29.429
P33: And so, as far as uploading, I'm I'm pretty good with anything.

411
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.409
Moderator: Okay. And are you a legal representative for the veteran.

412
00:36:35.301 --> 00:36:38.619
P33: Not the legal down as far as power of attorney.

413
00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:41.469
P33: Is that what you're asking about?

414
00:36:42.518 --> 00:36:45.629
Moderator: It can be that, or it can be

415
00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:49.740
Moderator: can be other other methods. So you're not sure.

416
00:36:50.615 --> 00:36:55.715
P33: Not. I don't believe I'm a legal, the word being legal

417
00:36:57.050 --> 00:37:00.370
P33: So she would have to click it for herself. Is that?

418
00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:04.869
P33: Or she would have to fill it out for herself, or can I fill it out for her.

419
00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:10.379
Moderator: I'd like you to do what you would do if you were filling it out.

420
00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:15.372
P33: Okay. If I was filling this out I would click that second bottom button. That's saying that I'm

421
00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:21.789
P33: her representative with legal authority for signing on behalf of her, because I can sign the checkbooks for her.

422
00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:23.749
P33: and I can sign

423
00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:32.110
P33: I can't sign with the title for the car. We went through that yesterday. We found that out.

424
00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:38.189
P33: She she has to be there as well, or I. We have to be there together, I should say

425
00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:44.469
P33: I would say that I would. I would check the bottom box.

426
00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.769
Moderator: Okay, you can go ahead and do that.

427
00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:51.199
Moderator: What would you expect to happen next?

428
00:37:52.685 --> 00:37:54.360
P33: Let's see what that does.

429
00:37:56.490 --> 00:38:01.489
P33: I would think there's going to be some sort of a electronic signature. Capture.

430
00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:03.220
P33: Page would be next.

431
00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:04.410
Moderator: Okay.

432
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:06.490
Moderator: you can continue.

433
00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:13.660
P33: Oops.

434
00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:25.189
P33: Alright, George, get it up there

435
00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:26.650
P33: early, though.

436
00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:30.790
P33: says her keyboard. Don't like me.

437
00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:41.680
P33: Yeah.

438
00:38:43.770 --> 00:38:46.249
P33: Yep, there's the power of attorney. Okay.

439
00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:56.959
P33: okay? So that's what I want. All those, is it? Oh, just one of these. Okay, so it's quite descriptive as to what I can do.

440
00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:01.859
P33: Disclaimer appointment, better service organization

441
00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:12.979
P33: down here.

442
00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:25.209
P33: and then then you also give information on how to do it. So that that's a big help to a lot of people.

443
00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:28.090
Moderator: Okay.

444
00:39:35.090 --> 00:39:37.300
P33: Documents. Okay?

445
00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:41.288
P33: And then assume if I hit the upload it'll take me to my

446
00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:45.564
P33: Say, I would have a

447
00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:48.310
P33: scan all this stuff first.st

448
00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:55.270
P33: What I would do is I I scan it, put it into a file and some of the stuff I may already have

449
00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:05.050
P33: on file and then upload it off of the computer. Once I've had it scanned into the file.

450
00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:09.555
P33: and you're quite explicit in making sure that everything is

451
00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:17.219
P33: load images.

452
00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:25.719
Moderator: So what kind of document would you upload now that you've seen this page.

453
00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:31.579
P33: The 1st one I'd be looking for is the power of attorney, because that seems to be.

454
00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:36.690
P33: I've been through that with my parents on the power of attorney, and that seems to.

455
00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:44.109
P33: answer a lot of people's questions. If you have that that seems to be more valid than a lot of other.

456
00:40:44.410 --> 00:40:51.830
P33: I items another type of document that your State considers proof of authority.

457
00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:53.530
P33: Yeah, I'll serve

458
00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:55.170
P33: alternate sign in.

459
00:40:56.410 --> 00:41:01.440
P33: Okay, so there's a form I can get from the Va. Here. It looks like the the fill out

460
00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:02.630
P33: that that.

461
00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:08.449
P33: And I just need one of these correct. And now that I'm reading it. It just says or or or or

462
00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:10.860
P33: okay.

463
00:41:13.050 --> 00:41:19.010
P33: the easiest one to do. And this is me is to get the form here.

464
00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:24.060
P33: I assume I can download this Va form 21 dash oh, 9, 7, 2

465
00:41:24.574 --> 00:41:29.189
P33: and have her and me sign this and then upload it.

466
00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:32.840
P33: That seems to be the simplest one.

467
00:41:33.789 --> 00:41:36.840
P33: Whereas power of attorney, you gotta go to the

468
00:41:38.170 --> 00:41:41.850
P33: bank at the safety deposit box and get it out of there.

469
00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:43.340
Moderator: Okay.

470
00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:51.519
P33: So you've got a couple of different options to download forms which which would make it somewhat easier. Sign them.

471
00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:59.980
P33: And I'm not, and I'm not real sure what somebody we have a scanner and everything else here. So

472
00:42:00.304 --> 00:42:05.010
P33: we don't have too much of a problem. I don't know what someone who doesn't have

473
00:42:05.754 --> 00:42:11.410
P33: all this access, how they would go about downloading it onto their system.

474
00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:28.890
P33: if if they had the form, and and I don't know. This is just off the top of my head. If I had the form I had my camera. Can I take a picture of the form and download? That? Would that be acceptable?

475
00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:34.420
P33: Having a picture of the form versus actually downloading the actual form.

476
00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:39.230
Moderator: Yeah, do you think it would? Based on what you see here?

477
00:42:40.127 --> 00:42:48.000
P33: Some places. Accept the pictures like that. Other places you've got to have the actual form, you know, filled out and downloaded.

478
00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:53.130
P33: And my thinking, this being part of the Va. That you're going to

479
00:42:53.943 --> 00:42:59.270
P33: the actual form downloaded somewhere versus simply taking a picture of it

480
00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:01.310
P33: and shell

481
00:43:01.747 --> 00:43:04.070
P33: copying it off of your phone.

482
00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:06.190
Moderator: Okay. Gotcha.

483
00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:09.060
P33: So my! My! Guess

484
00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:12.850
P33: they wouldn't accept a a picture of it.

485
00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:14.750
Moderator: Okay.

486
00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:22.099
Moderator: So let's go back a step and just select that you're the veteran, so we can bypass this

487
00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:23.830
Moderator: upload step

488
00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:31.520
Moderator: if you go down to the bottom where it said, continue, you can go back.

489
00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:35.959
Moderator: Let's do that. Select. I'm the veteran

490
00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:43.520
Moderator: and then continue.

491
00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:45.015
Moderator: okay.

492
00:43:46.330 --> 00:43:46.990
Moderator: okay.

493
00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:51.449
P33: If I review this, does it tell me, okay,

494
00:43:58.770 --> 00:44:03.849
P33: better statement of truth. Okay. So then they want the full name here, is that?

495
00:44:04.890 --> 00:44:06.849
P33: Okay? So I put in.

496
00:44:20.153 --> 00:44:21.320
P33: okay. So

497
00:44:23.795 --> 00:44:24.570
P33: And

498
00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:28.369
P33: I forgot. I use her middle name.

499
00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:37.550
P33: Oh, boy, I suppose Elizabeth's wrong.

500
00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:40.390
Moderator: Okay, how would you correct that.

501
00:44:41.303 --> 00:44:45.659
P33: I don't know. Probably have. Oh, wait, says Edit. So

502
00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:48.750
P33: let's edit this so can I get rid of.

503
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.880
P33: We'll make this easy, I hope?

504
00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:55.170
P33: Yeah, very little.

505
00:44:58.690 --> 00:44:59.840
P33: Okay.

506
00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:03.069
P33: Update page

507
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.980
P33: no.

508
00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:09.590
P33: Then I go down here and simply type in and live.

509
00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:16.410
P33: Oh, yeah.

510
00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:24.510
P33: So it's looking for

511
00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:26.610
P33: alright.

512
00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:39.669
Moderator: I just wanted to flag that we're a little over the scheduled time. I can keep going a little longer if you're able to.

513
00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:40.310
P33: Sure.

514
00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:43.740
P33: Okay, we can't be too far from them, can we?

515
00:45:44.090 --> 00:45:45.739
Moderator: Yeah, we're getting to the end here.

516
00:45:57.260 --> 00:45:58.290
P33: no.

517
00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:01.756
Moderator: Yeah, it won't actually

518
00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:05.189
Moderator: let you on our testing site. But.

519
00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:05.690
P33: Oh!

520
00:46:06.063 --> 00:46:11.670
Moderator: I'm curious what you thought about like, what's your comfort level filling out and signing

521
00:46:12.118 --> 00:46:16.069
Moderator: without all the people involved present on this page.

522
00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:22.920
P33: What's my feeling on signing? All run, run it by again.

523
00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:31.290
Moderator: What's your comfort level of filling out and signing that information? If all the people involved weren't present.

524
00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:33.839
P33: I would.

525
00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:37.639
P33: I don't have a problem if I know that like in this case

526
00:46:37.970 --> 00:46:46.399
P33: I would have sat down and talked with my wife and said, Here's what we're going to do. And then, if she had to do what she had to do, then I have no problem with it.

527
00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:52.240
P33: If I'm signing up a secondary person like I said, I would have had to get some information from them.

528
00:46:52.330 --> 00:46:59.920
P33: so they would have known I'm doing this, and once I did this, I would call them and say, Hey, you know we're signed up.

529
00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:04.738
P33: So I don't have a problem filling out information

530
00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:10.399
P33: like this when somebody else is not around. As long as they know that I'm going to do it.

531
00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:11.290
P33: If

532
00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:13.610
P33: I didn't

533
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:25.229
P33: talk to somebody I wouldn't have signed. They said. You know what. It'd be a great idea to sign Steve up and have him give me a hand. I'll sign him up as a secondary, but not ask him

534
00:47:25.450 --> 00:47:29.029
P33: 1st off. I wouldn't have necessarily have his information.

535
00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:35.619
P33: but I just wouldn't feel right signing somebody up and not explaining to them what I was signing them up for.

536
00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:43.170
P33: because I would think at some point they might get some sort of notification from the Va. And they'll go. What's all of this about.

537
00:47:43.770 --> 00:47:44.175
Moderator: Okay.

538
00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:50.760
P33: So I I don't have a i i'm very comfortable signing somebody up, not being here

539
00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:54.489
P33: as long as I have talked to them prior to it.

540
00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:56.959
Moderator: Okay, Gotcha. Thank you.

541
00:47:58.119 --> 00:48:11.290
Moderator: Okay. So for the last page that would come after this, I'm gonna share my screen and show it to you because we can't get it on the testing site. So I will just take the screen sharing over

542
00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:15.910
Moderator: and share that page. Can you see it. Okay? Do you need me to zoom in at all?

543
00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:21.290
P33: Yeah, that's it. Thank you for completing the application that might

544
00:48:22.690 --> 00:48:26.930
P33: Then it tells me who submitted, and my confirmation number and all of that.

545
00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:30.850
P33: Okay, what to expect.

546
00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:35.610
P33: And again, more questions. So you've got places to go that get answers.

547
00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:39.690
P33: And then they repeal us.

548
00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:40.790
P33: okay.

549
00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:50.959
Moderator: So could you describe to me in your own words what this page is telling you happened, and what comes next in the process.

550
00:48:53.150 --> 00:49:03.039
P33: What has happened is, has told me that my my information has been submitted. It actually gives me a little down blurb here of of what to expect next.

551
00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:06.850
P33: as far as

552
00:49:07.530 --> 00:49:12.090
P33: Want to get some sort of an email response type thing.

553
00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:17.759
P33: If there's something I'm not quite sure of, and I think that would fall into category if I was denied.

554
00:49:17.770 --> 00:49:28.979
P33: Would it deny me right away when I see like my, you know, if I click, submit, will it say it was denied? Right then, or after a period of time, I would get a denial letter.

555
00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:32.310
Moderator: What do you think would happen.

556
00:49:33.073 --> 00:49:40.420
P33: My guess is I would get a denial letter through the email saying that there was something wrong either in misinformation or

557
00:49:41.070 --> 00:49:44.850
P33: lack of information, or I sent the wrong documents.

558
00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:48.006
P33: And so

559
00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:57.170
P33: it does. Give me a couple of options here for asking more questions, and then.

560
00:49:57.180 --> 00:50:04.790
P33: if I'm actually denied. It gives me a whole appeal process on how to reapply if I'm if I've been denied.

561
00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:10.119
P33: And again looking at it, it all seems to be very.

562
00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:12.130
P33: very simply explained

563
00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:19.160
P33: a very simple process. If I if I did get denied on how

564
00:50:19.310 --> 00:50:21.019
P33: how to repeal for.

565
00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:26.680
Moderator: Okay. Is there anything that you'd like to see here that you don't.

566
00:50:36.090 --> 00:50:38.199
P33: No, it seems to be pretty

567
00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:48.199
P33: now. Can I get back to this page so I can get a if something came up. Can I get a confirmation number, or do I got to write it all down?

568
00:50:48.270 --> 00:50:51.730
P33: The 1st timers are a way of getting back to this in the future.

569
00:50:53.170 --> 00:50:56.000
Moderator: That's a good question. What would you expect?

570
00:50:56.981 --> 00:51:04.208
P33: Actually, I think about what I would when I get my letter, one way or another, whether I get an email or or a

571
00:51:04.570 --> 00:51:07.890
P33: I'd be expecting an email, I guess, versus a paper letter.

572
00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:20.480
P33: But I would think that whatever correspondence I got next, whether it says congratulations you've been accepted, or you've been denied, it'll have the confirmation number in it.

573
00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:24.947
P33: So that's what I would expect more so rather than

574
00:51:25.710 --> 00:51:34.749
P33: my knee jerk reaction at this point is before I venture from this page. What I would do is print the screen page, and then throw that into my

575
00:51:35.509 --> 00:51:41.350
P33: into my file so that I had the actual spring page printed.

576
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:49.129
P33: I don't know if it's not a printer on Screen Page, but that much I do know in that way. I've got a a receipt type thing.

577
00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:52.499
Moderator: Gotcha. Okay, thank you. That's helpful.

578
00:51:53.306 --> 00:51:58.229
Moderator: I'm gonna stop sharing my screen. Now. I just have a couple of final questions, and then we are done.

579
00:51:58.490 --> 00:51:59.340
P33: Okay.

580
00:51:59.937 --> 00:52:05.970
Moderator: So what research would you want to do before applying and completing a form like this? Now that you've seen it.

581
00:52:06.972 --> 00:52:21.599
P33: Probably more so the word you use, and that's the benefits to me, and I would look at to see what kind of benefits work to me, and or if I did have a secondary and find out what kind of benefits would help

582
00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:26.100
P33: that would be available to both of us

583
00:52:27.314 --> 00:52:31.055
P33: and then, like, I says, that 1st page shows you

584
00:52:31.530 --> 00:52:40.160
P33: the homework you need to do. You need the following information, so I would dig up all of the both my information

585
00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:52.390
P33: and the veterans information, and make sure I've got all their numbers, so I'm not having to get up in the middle and go run around and try and dig up information from either me, the veteran, or if there were secondary.

586
00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:56.250
Moderator: Okay.

587
00:52:57.308 --> 00:53:04.550
Moderator: What were your thoughts about the amount of information that was provided in the form? Did you think it was too much too little, or just enough.

588
00:53:05.497 --> 00:53:12.250
P33: Average for what va forms I fill out. It seems to be pretty much about what

589
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:14.550
P33: the standard that I would expect.

590
00:53:16.174 --> 00:53:34.749
P33: what might, what might be helpful. I didn't notice it. And then you tell me if it was there, there might be a little blurb in the one of the lower corners. Page one of 5 or page 2, or 5 or 8. How many. So it gives you an idea physically where you're at compared to where you're going to be at.

591
00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:39.830
P33: you know. Okay, this is a 24 page. Process.

592
00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:45.550
P33: I sit down with a cup of coffee type thing, and

593
00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:50.359
P33: and and start filling it out versus if it's only 5 pages, maybe something like that.

594
00:53:50.830 --> 00:53:53.139
Moderator: Okay, Gotcha, that's helpful.

595
00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:54.964
P33: Did you did have that

596
00:53:55.520 --> 00:54:00.160
P33: respondent? What is what was it called?

597
00:54:00.590 --> 00:54:01.740
Moderator: Burden.

598
00:54:01.740 --> 00:54:09.780
P33: Heard, responded Burden of 15 min. But let's be honest, not everybody's 15 min, especially when you're typing and

599
00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:17.550
P33: trying to do that. One person can type a whole lot faster than somebody who does one finger hunt and peck. And all this so.

600
00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:19.650
Moderator: Yeah.

601
00:54:19.650 --> 00:54:25.090
P33: Page total might be more helpful than telling me. It's only only going to be 15 min.

602
00:54:25.630 --> 00:54:27.210
Moderator: Okay, thank you.

603
00:54:27.788 --> 00:54:36.260
Moderator: Was there any information additional information about who qualifies to be a primary or secondary caregiver that you would have liked to see.

604
00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:45.019
P33: That might have been helpful. Yeah, because there wasn't some. It said there was a secondary, but I don't think it went in depth as to who qualifies and

605
00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:50.909
P33: that kind of a thing. So maybe more of a of a definition of the actual positions.

606
00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:52.150
Moderator: Okay?

607
00:54:52.990 --> 00:54:57.990
Moderator: Alright. So that is all the questions I have for you. Did you have any questions for me?

608
00:54:59.036 --> 00:55:03.203
P33: It seems easy enough straightforward. And you know the

609
00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:08.800
P33: very well written so that it's it's easily understandable, because

610
00:55:09.550 --> 00:55:10.310
P33: that's

611
00:55:10.747 --> 00:55:15.470
P33: I've met some people when you're at the Va. And not all of them are computer savvy?

612
00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:18.200
P33: And the easier it is for them

613
00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:19.940
P33: the the you know.

614
00:55:21.350 --> 00:55:25.580
P33: it makes the whole life. The your helpline gets a lot less calls.

615
00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:27.380
Moderator: Yeah, absolutely.

616
00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:28.770
Moderator: Okay.

617
00:55:29.143 --> 00:55:38.530
Moderator: So I just want to circle back and reconfirm. Are you comfortable? If we were to share a video clip of this session with our Va. Partners removing any information that could be used to identify you.

618
00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:39.440
Moderator: Yes.

619
00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:43.889
Moderator: Is there any part of our discussion that you wouldn't want shared in a video clip.

620
00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:44.840
P33: No.

621
00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:46.320
Moderator: Okay.

622
00:55:46.450 --> 00:55:53.749
Moderator: alright. Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us. The feedback is really helpful, so we can improve this form and make sure

623
00:55:53.760 --> 00:56:01.919
Moderator: it's working really well for all veterans and caregivers. Lastly, Perigan, which is the company that sent you the invite to this meeting.

624
00:56:02.212 --> 00:56:13.109
Moderator: We'll send you a thank you. Note in your email, and that will include a little blurb that you could pass along. If you know any other veterans or caregivers who may want to participate in research studies like this.

625
00:56:13.310 --> 00:56:13.970
P33: Okay.

626
00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:25.740
Moderator: Alright, that is it. Thank you so much. I really appreciate the patience with the signing on and and being able to hear. Thank you so much. This was a really helpful session, so I'm glad we kind of figured out.

627
00:56:26.190 --> 00:56:27.399
P33: All right. Thank you.

628
00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:29.430
Moderator: Alright! Thank you. Enjoy the rest of your day.

629
00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:30.840
P33: You, too. Bye-bye.

630
00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:31.450
Moderator: Hi.
