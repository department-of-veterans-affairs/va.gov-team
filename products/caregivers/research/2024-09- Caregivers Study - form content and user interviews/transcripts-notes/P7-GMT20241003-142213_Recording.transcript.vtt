Moderator: And

2
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:10.010
Moderator: that with you one more time I've started recording. So I'd just like to confirm. Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio. As we talk today.

3
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:11.450
P7: Yes, I am.

4
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:21.890
Moderator: Okay, thank you. And are you comfortable if we decided to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other Va partners. If we remove any identifying information in that clip.

5
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:23.840
P7: Yes, I agree to that.

6
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.959
Moderator: Alright. Thank you so much.

7
00:00:26.395 --> 00:00:32.079
Moderator: Okay. So before we take a look at that form, I have a few questions for you.

8
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.609
Moderator: Is it correct that you are enrolled in the program of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers?

9
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.150
P7: Yes, I am.

10
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:48.240
Moderator: Okay, and my records say that you applied or enrolled over 2 years ago. Is that correct?

11
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.430
P7: Yes, that's correct.

12
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.110
Moderator: Okay, about how long ago do you think.

13
00:00:53.224 --> 00:00:54.766
P7: It's cool, actually,

14
00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:02.170
P7: closer to the 3 year side. Now. It's probably about the 2 years and 8 months. Something like that.

15
00:01:03.107 --> 00:01:07.970
P7: Couldn't tell you the exact time I just know around when it was it was after.

16
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.829
P7: you know, after, like the Covid thing and all that kind of stuff. So.

17
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.252
Moderator: Gotcha. Okay, that's perfect.

18
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.930
Moderator: If you were going to explain the caregiver program to someone who was interested in enrolling, how would you explain it?

19
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.306
P7: Well, that's a good question. I would explain it, I mean, obviously,

20
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:43.949
P7: you. It's sort of anything to do with being a caregiver for somebody else is like a volunteer kind of thing that

21
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.738
P7: you you gotta be prepared to help out in any way possible. And

22
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.602
P7: dealing with the Va. Was something I was not used to, even though I was a veteran myself.

23
00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.043
P7: I wasn't used to going through the paperwork or the the sign up kind of things with,

24
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:11.970
P7: you know, for someone else. And it, it was an experience in the beginning for me, because I really didn't know what I was doing.

25
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.545
P7: but I found it that it was

26
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.880
P7: easier than I thought. Let's put it that way.

27
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.980
Moderator: Okay.

28
00:02:19.661 --> 00:02:27.820
P7: You know I I really didn't know what I was doing in the beginning, but like, if you're taking care of anybody and you're looking to help out someone and

29
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:35.670
P7: be their voice, or whatever you. However, you would like to, you know, phrase it, I you've got to do what you have to do so.

30
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.710
Moderator: Okay, thank you so much. Are you familiar with the concept of a primary and a secondary caregiver?

31
00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:55.929
P7: in the real world, not so much like in the Va. World. Yes, I've I've had to do that within family and stuff like that. So yeah.

32
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.770
Moderator: Do you know which one you're enrolled as with the Va.

33
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.549
P7: I'm like an I am not the primary.

34
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.410
Moderator: Okay.

35
00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:05.140
Moderator: that's.

36
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:11.299
P7: There's a there's a family member. This is a like extended family member of mine. So

37
00:03:11.818 --> 00:03:18.190
P7: they actually have, like a daughter who takes care of their everyday medical kind of decisions and things like that.

38
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.750
P7: I'm the one that gets like the job done. I'm I'm the

39
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.370
P7: on the wheels and the the body. You know what I mean. They get to grease the wheel. You know what I mean.

40
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:35.199
Moderator: Gotcha do you know if their daughter is enrolled as primary caregiver or caregiver at all

41
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.349
Moderator: with the Va.

42
00:03:36.761 --> 00:03:44.168
P7: Not with the Va. No, she strictly on on the personal side of financial things, and like

43
00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.779
P7: owning and taking care of the House and bills, and

44
00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.860
P7: you know, if there was a serious medical decision was like a life or death thing that would not be on me

45
00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:01.979
P7: then it probably wouldn't even be on the Va. If you wound up being in a local hospital. It's like a do not resuscitate kind of stuff.

46
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.759
P7: I'm not involved in any of that kind of stuff.

47
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.760
Moderator: Okay.

48
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.970
Moderator: gotcha

49
00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:15.130
Moderator: so do you remember how you enrolled for the program? And completed the caregiver form of signing up.

50
00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:16.950
P7: And.

51
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.109
Moderator: Veteran. If that was in person or online.

52
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.379
P7: I kind of did everything online. I, I believe I,

53
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:32.250
P7: I believe I got on the website 1st to like, look up some questions about basically a how to.

54
00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:38.960
P7: like, you know, go through the process. And I I think I had some questions, and if I recall

55
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:47.759
P7: there was a like a 1, 800 hotline or something, where I actually had some questions where I got to speak to a human being, one on one.

56
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.369
P7: and they kind of helped guide me through the process, and

57
00:04:51.698 --> 00:04:56.159
P7: they were there for me if I had any further questions, but I kind of like

58
00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.615
P7: worked it out and figured it out most of everything on my own, but I had a few questions, and

59
00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.829
P7: and they were helpful enough to, you know. Get me through the bumps.

60
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.460
Moderator: Thank you.

61
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:17.670
Moderator: Do you remember what you did in preparation for completing that form, and actually enrolling like any information you looked up or.

62
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:27.950
P7: Well, I had to take number one all all the the you know, the actual veterans of all the information I had to get a list of like what I was going to be, what was needed

63
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.050
P7: to fill out the form and then

64
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.650
P7: try to accomplish that task which it was a little difficult to get all the

65
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:41.438
P7: you know information. Dd, 2 forms and all this kind of stuff. And you know

66
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:48.019
P7: I got it done. It just wasn't a simple, simple process in the beginning. So.

67
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.650
P7: and it was just in the long run easier than I really enjoy.

68
00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.140
Moderator: So what seemed complicated about it@firstst

69
00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.100
P7: I've just

70
00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:04.341
P7: the volume of information needed. You know.

71
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.929
P7: when you're dealing with somebody that's having a problem. That doesn't comprehend.

72
00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:16.490
Moderator: Your audio cut out!

73
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.058
P7: Accurate information. Things like

74
00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:21.420
P7: dude

75
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.700
P7: doing took a few hands in the, you know, in the pop to

76
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:26.780
P7: but

77
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:33.199
P7: it was, you know it was workable, but it was difficult. It was just not simple.

78
00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.190
Moderator: Okay. Gotcha.

79
00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:43.550
P7: When people have, you know, some people have cognitive issues, and that along with other medical issues, you know, real physical issues. That would. That's

80
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:54.840
P7: it makes it the process a little harder. But like I said, there was help there, and there was a place to go, for if I had questions, and you know I probably couldn't have got through it without it. So.

81
00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:56.160
Moderator: Okay.

82
00:06:57.478 --> 00:07:06.099
Moderator: Your audio is cutting out a little bit. I think I gathered that, though. If that happens again, I may have to have you repeat something, but you're good now.

83
00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:07.400
P7: Okay.

84
00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:08.480
P7: Okay.

85
00:07:08.824 --> 00:07:18.129
Moderator: So did you complete that online form on your own? Or did you have help from someone like an accredited representative or a Vso or other source.

86
00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:19.690
P7: No, I did it myself.

87
00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:20.710
Moderator: Okay.

88
00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:26.370
Moderator: is there anything else that you'd like to share about your experience applying for the caregiver program, good or bad.

89
00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:31.689
P7: Well, I

90
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:33.210
P7: that

91
00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:35.950
P7: that other than

92
00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:41.569
P7: I'm sure it has evolved and gotten better since my like almost 3 years ago.

93
00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:45.760
P7: I'm sure they knew ways of doing things that that's

94
00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:59.470
P7: sped up the process or made it easier or simpler. So you know, as opposed to what it was almost 3 years ago to what it is now. I'm sure it's a better process. You've probably fixed some, taken some bugs out of this system and

95
00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:04.400
P7: make things a little easier, you know, accessible. So

96
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:18.329
P7: you know, looking back on it like I said, I really, I thought it was going to be a daunting task, and it really wasn't half as bad as I perceived it to be, and I'm sure it's much better now.

97
00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:19.680
P7: So.

98
00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:25.660
P7: having done a couple other zoom things about other parts of the veteran experience.

99
00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:30.879
P7: I have seen other things they've implemented in the last couple of years that are

100
00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:37.959
P7: made things a lot better for the veterans, and a lot better for everybody when you know everything's more workable. And

101
00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:44.830
P7: you know, people like me, they'd have to are kind of like on the inside, but also the outside of it.

102
00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:54.970
P7: We we find that really helpful to make our job easy. You know, I got to get them to the Va. That's where my main job is to make, you know, to clear the path, to get them help

103
00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:57.930
P7: and services when they need them. And

104
00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:03.849
P7: oh, that! That's that's the key thing to have it like it'd be a, you know, a smooth path, you know. That's

105
00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:09.040
P7: you know the people are caregivers, that's that's all we get.

106
00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.480
P7: Have not help us help them. So.

107
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:21.010
Moderator: Yes. Are you involved with the Va. In any other capacity, or just as a caregiver and a veteran yourself?

108
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:23.693
P7: I do a lot of

109
00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:29.219
P7: things like at my local American Legion.

110
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:35.150
P7: I'm 1 of the drivers I volunteer every month. They give us a list that I'm going to need.

111
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:38.650
P7: They would

112
00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:46.830
P7: and we get. We provide rides, you know, transportation. And we have a group of guys, and we take turns with

113
00:09:46.850 --> 00:10:00.220
P7: we whenever the name comes up on a list. So and so. Jack needs a ride on Tuesday. Who's available the 14th of the month, you know, for 8 am. Or at 9 am. And yeah, I volunteer that way. So.

114
00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.740
Moderator: That's awesome. Thank you so much for doing that.

115
00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:13.279
P7: Well, I'm a veteran, you know. By the grace of God, I'm not one of those guys. I'm I'm I'm you know, Mobile. I can get around. I'm you know, 72, and very active. So

116
00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.879
P7: you know, I'm 1 of the lucky ones.

117
00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:17.890
Moderator: Oh, that's great!

118
00:10:18.248 --> 00:10:24.680
Moderator: Alright. So now we're gonna take a look at that form. I'm gonna post the link to our testing site in the Zoom chat.

119
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:29.370
Moderator: Let me know if you need help finding that I know it's a little funky on the poll.

120
00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:31.670
P7: Let me get my glasses on here.

121
00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:55.820
P7: Okay.

122
00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:00.511
Moderator: Do you got that link open on your phone.

123
00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:06.509
P7: Yeah, apply for the program of a comprehensive assistance for family caregivers.

124
00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:15.300
Moderator: Perfect. Now I would like you to share your screen with me in zoom. So you have to go back to the zoom window on your phone.

125
00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:18.584
P7: Oh, gosh! Here we go! Now! Here's where I'm challenged.

126
00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:22.339
Moderator: Time I'll try to help.

127
00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:25.709
P7: Just what do I do? Just arrow back from here, or something.

128
00:11:26.786 --> 00:11:31.419
Moderator: You wanna go back to the zoom application on your phone. See me.

00:11:44.908 --> 00:11:52.650
Moderator: Well, you wanna go back to, maybe maybe worries. Yep, that should be it. Cause now I can see your face

131
00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.570

P7: How do I care about.

134
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:07.930
Moderator: Do you see a green button that says share at the bottom in the zoom window.

135
00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:11.929
P7: Who can see your messages? It says.

136
00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:16.560
P7: Okay.

137
00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:23.820
P7: did that do anything.

138
00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:34.179
Moderator: No, not yet. Do you see the like? You may have to tap the screen for a toolbar to come up at the bottom of the zoom window.

139
00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:40.149
Moderator: and then there should be a green button that says Share, and it has, like an arrow that points up.

140
00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:51.029
P7: I only got this little thing at the bottom, and it's

141
00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:57.879
P7: says, who can see your messages recording on? And it says, Hit, okay, I guess.

142
00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:00.040
P7: and that's

143
00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:07.759
P7: that's kind of like all I have on my screen. Nothing's coming up from the bottom other than that.

144
00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.640
Moderator: Okay, what if you just like? Sometimes you have.

145
00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:14.319
P7: What if I hit the close button on this page where I'm at right now?

146
00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.230
Moderator: Okay.

147
00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:16.810
P7: Let's try that.

148
00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:19.190
P7: There we go, that one back to you.

149
00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:20.160
Moderator: Okay.

150
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:24.949
Moderator: try tapping the screen to try to get that toolbar to come up.

151
00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:26.350
P7: Okay, I got it

152
00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.999
P7: alright. I'm going to

153
00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.539
P7: hit share. I got it.

154
00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:40.149
Moderator: Okay? And then you wanna find the window where the the testing site is open and just share that with me.

155
00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:49.950
P7: Okay, which one would that be? So I can share camera screen web. URL,

156
00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:51.540
P7: document.

157
00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:58.290
Moderator: If you do screen, I'm not sure what the web, URL one is. That might be

158
00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.409
Moderator: I would do share, screen.

159
00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:03.999
P7: Are recording or casting with zoom.

160
00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:07.459
Moderator: Yep. And then just you have to hit like, okay or something.

161
00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:08.300
P7: Okay.

162
00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:13.530
P7: Hmm.

163
00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:18.459
P7: I got. Now, I have you on the bottom right of the screen.

164
00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.550
P7: It's loading.

165
00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:21.670
Moderator: Okay.

166
00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:27.439
Moderator: I still just see you.

167
00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:30.423
P7: And now this brought up a bunch of

168
00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:32.500
P7: apps.

169
00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.100
Moderator: Okay.

170
00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:35.560
Moderator: does it?

171
00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:41.320
Moderator: Does it? Let you share that that window where the form is open?

172
00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:48.470
P7: Down on the zoom, part.

173
00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:51.689
Moderator: Yeah, it might be like.

174
00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:54.759
P7: There we go. I clicked on. Zoom should be open now

175
00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:55.990
P7: for sharing.

176
00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:04.079
Moderator: Oh, it might you might be! You had to give permission for Zoom to share your screen.

177
00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:08.600
P7: I have the button to the right, so we're

178
00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:19.450
P7: Hello.

179
00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:30.640
P7: I honestly don't know where to go from. Here.

180
00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:31.320
Moderator: Okay.

181
00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:35.390
P7: I have I hit? I hit the zoom I have gave permission, so.

182
00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:36.990
Moderator: Okay.

183
00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.130
Moderator: Should. Oh.

184
00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:40.340
P7: I'm back with you now.

185
00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:48.620
Moderator: Okay, it's working. I can see your screen. So I just need to open whatever browser you open that link in that I sent.

186
00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.369
Moderator: There we go.

187
00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:51.780
P7: Okay.

188
00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:53.319
Moderator: Yay, okay. I see it.

189
00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:54.540
P7: You got it.

190
00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:56.709
Moderator: Thank you so much for your patience. Really appreciate it.

191
00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:00.961
P7: That's okay. I'm a little. I'm a little challenged.

192
00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:07.270
Moderator: Honestly, it's never really easy on Mobile especially, and if you don't use it every day, you know it's tough.

193
00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:07.849
P7: All right.

194
00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:10.399
P7: Okay, I got you. We're here.

195
00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:20.139
Moderator: So I'd like you to kind of review this page here and tell me what your initial thoughts are, and the expectations of the form before going forward and applying.

196
00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:24.980
P7: Okay, let me give it a quick scan here with my eyes and read it over a little.

197
00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:26.550
Moderator: Take your time.

198
00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:41.091
P7: Just gather your information for it. I seem to recall that.

199
00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:43.329
Moderator: Yeah, from when you applied.

200
00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:50.302
P7: Well, I believe it was something to that nature about gathering all your proper information. That kind of brings

201
00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:54.070
P7: bring some to me of something I did.

202
00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:57.190
Moderator: Gotcha.

203
00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:04.859
P7: Yeah, there's then that's the caregiver support number. So

204
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:08.839
P7: that's that also rings true to me.

205
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:18.900
P7: Okay, this kind of looks a little lot. Some of this looks very familiar, so.

206
00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:20.359
Moderator: Okay.

207
00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:26.220
Moderator: does anything stand out to you on this page as being confusing or particularly helpful?

208
00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:30.109
P7: Well, the helpful part, of course, is the having the

209
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:36.629
P7: the caregiver support Hotline, I guess you would call it. I I think that's like a really key thing, cause you.

210
00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:44.690
P7: if you run into any obstacles along the way which, like I did you, it gives you someone you can actually speak to.

211
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:54.220
P7: So and then, you know, one thing I see here that I don't remember seeing is like, go to our career support program

212
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:56.710
P7: teams Directory. I don't remember

213
00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:02.970
P7: seeing it like a directory, or if even being offered one back, then it may have been there, and I overlooked it. But

214
00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:07.579
P7: I think that's like a real helpful thing to have like a directory like. So you could

215
00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:15.170
P7: maybe direct yourself to exactly what you know, what you're looking for, or what you can't find, or what you know. You have a question about

216
00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:20.959
P7: having a directory could save a lot of time, and may you might be able to look it up without making a phone call.

217
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.639
Moderator: Okay.

218
00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:24.270
Moderator: Gotcha.

219
00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:28.891
P7: But yeah, this this looks

220
00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:32.690
P7: vaguely familiar. Most of this, as far as like

221
00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:36.079
P7: how to start the application, and all that kind of stuff.

222
00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:38.000
Moderator: Okay.

223
00:18:39.065 --> 00:18:45.130
Moderator: If you were to rate this page on a scale of one to 5, 1 being the worst 5 being the best.

224
00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:51.949
Moderator: How prepared and informed. Do you think that this page makes you feel about the application you're about to begin.

225
00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:58.729
P7: Oh, I would be! This would be like a 5 to me, because it gives you pretty much everything you need to know right here in front of you.

226
00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:09.520
P7: you know, like I said, and if you came across something that could be an oddity or an unusual occurrence, you know you've got the hotline to call up and

227
00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:11.689
P7: somebody to talk to.

228
00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:13.510
Moderator: Okay.

229
00:19:15.208 --> 00:19:17.980
Moderator: we can go ahead and start the application. Then.

230
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.737
P7: Okay, let me go down there.

231
00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:36.019
Moderator: Okay, and I'm just gonna have you start filling out the form thinking aloud as much as possible.

232
00:19:36.409 --> 00:19:46.289
Moderator: This is a test form, so you can put in real or fake information is up to you. But it's not. It's not a real form, so it will not go anywhere.

233
00:19:46.677 --> 00:19:50.880
Moderator: I'll give you a fake social security number to put in when we get to those steps.

234
00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:55.640
P7: I'm just use my name here for the heck of it, so.

235
00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:28.880
Moderator: Okay. So here you can put 3, 2, 1,

236
00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:35.469
Moderator: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

237
00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:00.780
Moderator: I see you're kind of pausing on this one. Why is that.

238
00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:05.380
P7: Okay.

239
00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:13.140
P7: Oh, I gave you my code on here.

240
00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:20.905
P7: Okay.

241
00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:50.080
Moderator: So how would you prefer to search for a Va. Facility here.

242
00:21:55.470 --> 00:22:02.489
P7: Well, if I was, you know, if I was doing this for myself, I'd be looking for the closest convenient facility

243
00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:12.110
P7: if I've been doing this for somebody else than me as a caregiver. I'm kind of like locked into where they already have been.

244
00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:19.240
P7: or been recommended to go to, or something. You know they've already. Most of these people have already spoken

245
00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:24.400
P7: or been through the Va. At one time or another, whether with that been here or somewhere else.

246
00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:31.850
P7: So I I would be looking for the most convenient like for here this week, like Philadelphia for me. So

247
00:22:33.227 --> 00:22:37.100
P7: you know I'd be, I'd be typing in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

248
00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:39.679
Moderator: Okay, you can go ahead and do that.

249
00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:45.809
Moderator: You're like very close to me. I'm in Levittown, PA.

250
00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:50.779
P7: Hello! How are you? Yeah, I'm in. I'm in South Jersey, right over the bridge. So.

Moderator: Oh, your shirt!

252
00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:53.430

P7: Yeah, I'm I'm I'm close by.

254
00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:02.320
Moderator: That's a huge medical facility.

255
00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:03.860
Moderator: that Philly one.

256
00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:04.950
P7: Yeah.

257
00:23:06.442 --> 00:23:08.560
P7: What didn't I do right here?

258
00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:12.580
P7: Select the Medical Center

259
00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:20.879
P7: or postal code. I don't know a postal code for there. But

260
00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:26.400
P7: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is all I could put in right

261
00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.210
P7: while we're here.

262
00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:42.410
P7: Okay, hitting the different places.

263
00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:54.810
P7: Alright.

264
00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:03.399
P7: it should sell me

265
00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:04.920
P7: where to go.

266
00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:12.979
Moderator: Yeah, I'm curious. Your thoughts about that page. Let's just go back real quickly.

267
00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:14.010
Moderator: Thank you.

268
00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:14.620
P7: Okay.

269
00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:15.580
Moderator: And

270
00:24:18.158 --> 00:24:21.019
Moderator: why did you choose the facility that you did.

271
00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:33.013
P7: I I kind of like just pick the you know, place by

272
00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:39.099
P7: convenience for directional purposes. For me, you know, getting from point A to Point B,

273
00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:46.569
P7: that I think you know making it an informed decision when I did. That was kind of like, you know, I just

274
00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:49.969
P7: I was looking for a place was easy to drive to.

275
00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:51.400
Moderator: Okay.

276
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:53.484
P7: You know what I mean. But

277
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:57.769
P7: I guess if I was doing this for real.

278
00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:01.260
P7: and I would be looking at what you know

279
00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:05.638
P7: what is handled there, you know. Maybe specialized thing.

280
00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:07.810
P7: you know what I mean.

281
00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:09.609
Moderator: How would you find that.

282
00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:19.040
P7: Well, I guess I click on the each facility that was offered there, and try to learn a little bit about what they, what services are provided there, and

283
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:22.350
P7: you know what my specialty might be like in

284
00:25:22.866 --> 00:25:27.389
P7: you know. God forbid it was the person's an amputee or something.

285
00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:30.930
P7: You know what I'm saying? Not every facility is going to have

286
00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:32.620
P7: amputee.

287
00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:35.580
P7: maybe certification. If you want to put it that way.

288
00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:41.744
P7: You know what I mean. So I'd I'd be looking. I would have probably going on

289
00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:49.219
P7: on the on the main website to see what places you know. Kind of match up the services I'm really looking for.

290
00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:50.240
Moderator: Okay.

291
00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:56.850
P7: And and then I would probably go back to this, and, you know, sign up for the place that was suggested to me.

292
00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:02.310
P7: I don't know how I would find that out from here, from where I am on this like page

293
00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:10.510
P7: or or the previous stage. I don't think it. It gives me that kind of ability to do that. I don't think it'd be nice if it did.

294
00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:13.499
Moderator: Yeah, that's great feedback. Thank you.

295
00:26:14.085 --> 00:26:18.809
Moderator: What if you wanted to change the facility that you selected and do a new search.

296
00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:31.189
P7: Well, I guess I have to arrow back and make a change right? So I could go back.

297
00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:34.480
P7: and I'd have to type in another.

298
00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:35.780
P7: you know

299
00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:44.410
P7: type in Philadelphia again, and then, you know, hit the spyglass thing and see where where different places are located in Philadelphia.

300
00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:48.459
P7: Kind of run, run through the the list again that they gave me.

301
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:51.349
Moderator: Okay, you can go ahead and do that, please.

302
00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:52.390
P7: Okay.

303
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.372
P7: alright. Looks like.

304
00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:04.970
P7: for

305
00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:08.820
P7: for the sake of this conversation, let's say.

306
00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:16.159
P7: well, the next place that there I looked for was even closer, Camden, the Camden Va clinic. So

307
00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:19.309
P7: I'll click on that and continue with that.

308
00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:20.400
Moderator: Okay.

309
00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:26.200
P7: And then she, you know, pops up the the address and

310
00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:31.979
P7: the information for the Camden clinic, and

311
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:38.079
P7: because my assigned caregiver support facility.

312
00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:40.529
Moderator: What do you.

313
00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:41.000
P7: And.

314
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:41.590
Moderator: That.

315
00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:45.500
P7: Well, I I

316
00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:55.869
P7: I don't know what to think about. I don't. I don't believe that's anything I have a control over. Right? That's like an automated, pre-filled thing out right. If you I just get sent to whoever

317
00:27:56.410 --> 00:28:02.340
P7: they decide is going to be my facility support right? I don't really have a choice without that delay.

318
00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:06.680
Moderator: Okay, well, I'm just curious what your, what you.

319
00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:14.949
P7: I mean, I'm asking you if if I was aware that like that, I had a choice, I might want to make one, but I'm not aware that that's even a possibility.

320
00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:20.883
P7: So I would have to take what I see here for granted, and say, well, that that's who they say is my

321
00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:24.550
P7: you know, support facility, and it is what it is.

322
00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:27.569
P7: and that would be. That would be okay with me.

323
00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:33.549
P7: You know what I mean. I just don't know if there's options to that or not. I I doesn't tell you here, and

324
00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:35.370
P7: you know.

325
00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:40.220
P7: other than the the need help thing. You know what I mean. So

326
00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:45.710
P7: I guess if you had a had a problem with it, you could talk to somebody, live about it, and

327
00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:48.439
P7: they would explain your options. I imagine.

328
00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:49.350
Moderator: Okay.

329
00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:51.030
Moderator: So

330
00:28:51.560 --> 00:29:03.539
Moderator: going to rate this process of selecting a Va facility, one to 5, 1 being the worst 5 being the best. How would you rate that process, and how easy it was to do.

331
00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:09.827
P7: This was very easy. I read it to 5 2. This was much easier, so far, than what I originally went through so

332
00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:13.229
P7: much easier, much easier.

333
00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:15.920
Moderator: Okay, we can keep going. Then.

334
00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:17.020
P7: Okay.

335
00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:22.449
Moderator: Now, what does the term primary caregiver mean to you?

336
00:29:26.207 --> 00:29:31.129
P7: To me. That's the person who is like the final say

337
00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:37.730
P7: in the in the family, if, of course, you know, if they have family, or whoever they've designated to

338
00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:40.140
P7: take care of, like their.

339
00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:49.609
P7: you know their final wishes, no matter whether that means like death or you know how, where they're going to be treated, and how they're going to be treated. And

340
00:29:49.990 --> 00:30:03.010
P7: you know there do not resuscitate plans. All that is like, whoever they care to be their primary person. I never figured myself as a primary person unless there's somebody in my family that asked me to be

341
00:30:04.375 --> 00:30:05.150
P7: so.

342
00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:06.410
Moderator: Okay.

343
00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:10.921
P7: Like. I say, I see myself as a transportation means and a

344
00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:15.489
P7: yeah, I'm a caregiver in a lot of other ways, too. But you know what I mean.

345
00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:24.170
P7: The ultimate caregiver is the person who's going to have to make the hard decision somewhere along the line, and that's usually, you know.

346
00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:28.019
P7: somebody very close the closest one in the family to them.

347
00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:29.140
Moderator: Okay.

348
00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:30.500
Moderator: Gotcha.

349
00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:36.729
Moderator: So let's go through as though you're adding a primary caregiver to this application and keep going through the form.

350
00:30:37.410 --> 00:30:38.505
P7: Okay,

351
00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:44.840
P7: I'm I'm gonna apply then. But you want me to apply here as the primary care group.

352
00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:46.380
Moderator: Yes, please.

353
00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:47.080
P7: Okay

354
00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:57.249
P7: I would be. I'd be going repeating myself, putting all my information back in again.

355
00:30:57.750 --> 00:31:00.949
Moderator: Yeah, we'll just have to put a different social security number.

356
00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:07.840
P7: Yeah, it's okay. Well, I'll make. I'll throw my own in one. Don't worry about it. I'm not worried about anybody stealing my info. I could care less.

357
00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:09.869
Moderator: Absolutely will not. We will.

358
00:31:10.154 --> 00:31:18.980
P7: I'm not worried about it. There's nothing you can get from me. It doesn't matter. So I'm I'm fine with it. If I can't trust you guys. I can't trust anybody

359
00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:25.609
P7: for the sake of this thing. I'm gonna say, I'm the son. Okay.

360
00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:26.450
Moderator: Okay.

361
00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:33.500
P7: Because that's probably who would be mine to be honest with you.

362
00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:07.279
P7: and I'll go back

363
00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:09.023
P7: beat that

364
00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:22.660
P7: cool.

365
00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:48.020
Moderator: Okay, so what does a secondary caregiver mean to you?

366
00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:51.810
Moderator: Excuse me.

367
00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:57.170
P7: Well, it's like, you know, to me it's just a backup plan for the for the

368
00:32:57.470 --> 00:33:02.830
P7: primary caregiver. So in case that they're incapacitated, or

369
00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:06.580
P7: you know, whatever out of the country, or

370
00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:10.520
P7: whatever somebody that would have secondary

371
00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:12.730
P7: responsibility.

372
00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:21.370
Moderator: Okay. And how do you think that that secondary role differs in the application process and the benefits from the primary caregiver.

373
00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:27.480
P7: That's a good question. I have no idea how that would affect an application.

374
00:33:27.973 --> 00:33:32.210
P7: I I'm only thinking about it in a legal sense.

375
00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:33.330
P7: you know.

376
00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:41.770
P7: you know. Quite frankly I went through this with my mother and my sister.

377
00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:48.639
P7: and she was a primary, and I was a secondary, and my sister was out, and my mom was put on a ventilator.

378
00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:53.309
P7: and I had to make a call. So I can only think about it from a legal sense.

379
00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:54.270
P7: Yeah.

380
00:33:55.210 --> 00:34:01.670
P7: as far as this goes, I really don't know how you handle that from the Va's end.

381
00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:03.047
P7: I would think.

382
00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:09.160
P7: you have to have some kind of a declaration, don't you?

383
00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:17.809
P7: Isn't there a declaration of like, Who's in? Who's number one on the list? And who's number 2.

384
00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:21.090
Moderator: Yeah, I'm just curious how you think that would work.

385
00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:26.630
P7: That's how I think it should be. I think it should. It should be like there should be a declaration going into

386
00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:30.019
P7: any of these kind of things when you.

387
00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:33.219
P7: you know, when you apply for stuff like this.

388
00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:43.720
P7: you gotta have a primary person, and it's clearly stated they're the primary. And you know you know Bob's the primary, and Joe is the secondary.

389
00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:46.420
P7: Should it come to that, or you know.

390
00:34:47.699 --> 00:34:55.479
P7: and I just believe it's got to be pre-spelled out, just like having a do not resuscitate or anything else. You know.

391
00:34:55.850 --> 00:34:56.510
Moderator: Okay.

392
00:34:56.670 --> 00:34:58.159
Moderator: Gotcha. Thank you.

393
00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:09.859
Moderator: I just wanna flag that we are like. 3 min from when the the scheduled session was to end. I can go over a little bit, but I wanted to see if you need. If you have a hard stop at 11.

394
00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:12.790
P7: I'm okay. You know I'm I'm with you.

395
00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:14.820
Moderator: You can go over a little bit.

396
00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:15.710
P7: Sure.

397
00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:16.710
Moderator: Okay.

398
00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:19.240
Moderator: Alright. Let's go with.

399
00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:22.150
P7: Now, where do you want me to go from here? Do you want me to? Just

400
00:35:22.983 --> 00:35:27.310
P7: would you like to apply for benefits for secondary, for no

401
00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:29.960
P7: continue

402
00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:33.990
P7: application signature.

403
00:35:36.610 --> 00:35:39.450
P7: I'm a representative. Continue.

404
00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:54.375
Moderator: It's okay. If you need to answer that.

405
00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:56.379
P7: It's all right. Yeah.

406
00:35:57.050 --> 00:36:00.029
P7: one of my veteran buddies actually calling me right there.

407
00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:03.249
P7: So I must upload a file

408
00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:07.830
P7: for the sake of this thing. I I don't have a file to upload, so.

409
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.970
Moderator: Yeah, that's okay. Are you the legal representative for the veteran.

410
00:36:13.610 --> 00:36:19.130
P7: Well in this, in this particular thing that we just filed. I'm being like the son of the veteran, right? So.

411
00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:26.879
Moderator: So you're well in in real life, are you? The legal representative for career veteran.

412
00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:32.899
P7: I am not the legal representative. I am his Va. Representative. So

413
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:34.230
P7: what's that mean?

414
00:36:35.570 --> 00:36:38.920
Moderator: Well, that's just good to know that that's kind of your understanding of it.

415
00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:40.030
Moderator: Yeah.

416
00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:48.599
P7: In other words, I'm not. I'm not like you know I can't. I can't decide whether to pull the plug about this guy or nothing like that. But

417
00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:52.430
P7: I'm I'm his voice for the Va.

418
00:36:52.970 --> 00:37:02.470
P7: okay, that's what I consider my my duty and my what I'm doing with diva as a caregiver is I'm his voice and representative.

419
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:05.360
P7: That's how I look at it. I mean.

420
00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:06.480
Moderator: Okay.

421
00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:11.760
Moderator: so would you have anything to upload if you came to this page.

422
00:37:15.509 --> 00:37:19.730
P7: Like a file or something of a declaration. No.

423
00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:21.710
Moderator: Okay.

424
00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:24.069
P7: I would not have anything.

425
00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:25.740
Moderator: Okay?

426
00:37:26.544 --> 00:37:30.169
Moderator: So let's go back a step.

427
00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:38.129
Moderator: and you will just have to put that. You're the veteran signing for yourself to get that step.

428
00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:39.460
P7: Okay.

429
00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:46.849
Moderator: Okay. So just take a look over this page and tell me what your impressions are.

430
00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:59.329
P7: Can I click on these things and see what they say inside, like the veterans, information, and all that.

431
00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:02.640
Moderator: Whatever you would naturally do

432
00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:04.620
Moderator: if you were filling out the form.

433
00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:06.300
P7: Yeah, that's what I would do.

434
00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:10.939
P7: All the caregiver information application.

435
00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:15.480
P7: See here, it spells right out. Secondary family caregiver.

436
00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:17.030
P7: Oh.

437
00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:22.899
Moderator: Okay, what would you do if you needed to correct something?

438
00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:36.750
P7: Well, I guess I'd have to go back to where I made a mistake and correct it from there, and I found out once I got to this screen that I made a mistake

439
00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:40.900
P7: in the previous screen. I might have to, you know. Go back

440
00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:45.209
P7: and adjust. You know the information.

441
00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:50.560
Moderator: Keep going through this page.

442
00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:51.730
P7: Okay.

443
00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:29.220
P7: Okay.

444
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.389
Moderator: What do you think about that.

445
00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:33.552
P7: I think it's

446
00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:44.989
P7: think it's pretty well spelled out what your responsibilities and what expectations are here, as far as being a caregiver.

447
00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:47.570
Moderator: Okay.

448
00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:50.520
P7: I don't see much.

449
00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:51.620
P7: you know.

450
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:54.630
P7: Doubt of what what you're signing up to do here.

451
00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:56.970
Moderator: Okay.

452
00:39:57.308 --> 00:40:05.420
P7: I think you you, if you read this thing properly, and you got an understanding of the English language, you pretty much know your

453
00:40:05.850 --> 00:40:12.710
P7: you're you know you're pretty much the the representative was when it comes to the Va.

454
00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:16.990
P7: To anything else. Maybe not. But for the Va. You are.

455
00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:18.670
Moderator: Okay.

456
00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:21.999
Moderator: So I want you to fill it out

457
00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:24.830
Moderator: as though you were completing the form.

458
00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:33.379
P7: Go back here.

459
00:40:55.650 --> 00:40:57.850
P7: Oh, I didn't put the junior in.

460
00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:01.020
P7: Here we go.

461
00:41:29.397 --> 00:41:35.109
P7: What's my problem here? I'm not making a capital Y or something. What's it

462
00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:39.170
P7: unless.

463
00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:42.449
Moderator: Yeah, what would you do to correct that.

464
00:41:43.171 --> 00:41:45.610
P7: I'm gonna try to have to go back and

465
00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:49.820
P7: go to the capital Y and drop to Junior.

466
00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:19.730
Moderator: And what would be your comfort, level with filling out and signing this information without all of the people who are involved, present.

467
00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:23.049
P7: I'm comfortable doing it. I just get

468
00:42:24.194 --> 00:42:25.375
P7: I get annoyed

469
00:42:26.850 --> 00:42:31.910
P7: when I have to keep going, when I have to keep going back and redoing stuff. I'm I don't have the greatest

470
00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:36.510
P7: amount of patience. I'm not one of those kind of patient people I'm

471
00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:47.310
P7: you know I'm not. I'm you know, even when I'm doing my own medical information and stuff, I'm I'm not the best guy for patients. I

472
00:42:47.550 --> 00:42:50.099
P7: I find a lot of it redundant, and

473
00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:51.230
P7: we have a.

474
00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:55.970
Moderator: Yeah, are you just referring to these errors that are popping up, or anything else.

475
00:42:58.170 --> 00:43:03.170
P7: Anytime I have to fill anything. It takes me longer than like 5 min to do it. I'm

476
00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:05.749
P7: I'm I'm out of my comfort zone.

477
00:43:05.890 --> 00:43:10.729
P7: If I go to fill out anything in any kind of way that takes me more than 5 min.

478
00:43:10.770 --> 00:43:15.270
P7: my attention span don't go much longer than that. And I, I get kind of like.

479
00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:16.599
P7: you know.

480
00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:17.910
P7: yeah, Antsy.

481
00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:22.590
P7: alright, submit the application.

482
00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:29.989
P7: It's not letting me. Okay, what's going on here.

483
00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:39.629
Moderator: Yeah, I'm gonna have you just try to figure out why it won't, and then then we'll be

484
00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:41.189
Moderator: finish with this part.

485
00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:51.840
P7: Well, let me see here I'm I'm so confused over what I originally did, put in without myself.

486
00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:54.120
P7: All right.

487
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:59.759
P7: So my original thing back here. Let's go back to this.

488
00:44:18.610 --> 00:44:21.879
Moderator: That's still not clear. Why, it's Pop giving you an error.

489
00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:32.150
P7: It's not clear to me. It says your signature must match previously entered. Name Robert Yoakam, Jr. So I got it all capitalized the way it was

490
00:44:32.530 --> 00:44:35.929
P7: I hit the I certified things required.

491
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:41.139
P7: Let me go down to the next thing. It looks like it should be right.

492
00:44:41.610 --> 00:44:45.079
P7: It's not. I have no idea what's not. Why, it isn't.

493
00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:48.359
Moderator: Okay, that's really helpful. Feedback. Appreciate it.

494
00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:55.390
P7: Okay, I mean, I'm I'm looking at what it's telling me. It's telling me it must match Robert Yoakam, Jr.

495
00:44:55.740 --> 00:45:00.749
P7: Capital, R. Capital, y. Junior, and I have that the way it's supposed to be.

496
00:45:02.170 --> 00:45:02.980
Moderator: Yeah, I think.

497
00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:08.560
P7: Oh, wait a minute. Let me. Let's just put a capital J here and see if that makes a difference.

498
00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:19.270
P7: Doesn't look what's appear to.

499
00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:24.290
Moderator: Yeah, I think it's probably because of the period

500
00:45:24.530 --> 00:45:29.910
Moderator: that's missing. But it's really good to see you like try to go through this. So we can.

501
00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:32.599
P7: Is that what it is? The period man.

502
00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:33.600
Moderator: Yeah.

503
00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:34.410
P7: Alright.

504
00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:41.199
P7: So what it was. I didn't even see the period. That's how bad my eyes are.

505
00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:49.100
Moderator: No, it's we need to make sure that this works for everyone of all ages and abilities. So it's really helpful.

506
00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:50.200
P7: All right.

507
00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:58.630
Moderator: Well, we're good on this. I'm going to share the last page because you can't get to the confirmation page in the testing site.

508
00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:04.049
Moderator: So I will share, and it will just stop. It will stop your screen from sharing.

509
00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:08.940
P7: Alright, so I gotta go back to take the share off.

510
00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:15.369
Moderator: I can. I'm able to like take it away from you, so you don't have to figure out how to do that.

511
00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:19.560
P7: I'm going back to the screen where I can see you as of right now.

512
00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:21.360
P7: Okay, I got it.

513
00:46:22.549 --> 00:46:24.719
Moderator: Do you see my screen? It says.

514
00:46:26.090 --> 00:46:26.550
P7: Yep.

515
00:46:26.890 --> 00:46:33.870
Moderator: Okay. So I want you to just kinda take a look through this page and let me know

516
00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:36.119
Moderator: any thoughts or

517
00:46:37.394 --> 00:46:40.050
Moderator: expectations you're having here.

518
00:46:43.610 --> 00:46:45.990
Moderator: Just tell me if I'm not scrolling fast enough

519
00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:47.960
Moderator: or too fast.

520
00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:50.169
P7: That's all right. We're doing good.

521
00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:56.130
P7: Okay?

522
00:46:57.070 --> 00:47:01.895
P7: So I wanna, I probably had need to print this page for my records.

523
00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:11.790
Moderator: Sorry I'm trying to.

524
00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:12.969
P7: It's all right.

525
00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:15.860
Moderator: Scroll down, and it's being a little wonky.

526
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:22.810
Moderator: And why it's doing that. Let me share it again.

527
00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:25.699
Moderator: Just did this to me yesterday.

528
00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:29.970
Moderator: No! No!

529
00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:37.240
Moderator: Hi!

530
00:47:39.010 --> 00:47:41.129
Moderator: Sorry! One moment.

531
00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:42.589
P7: It's all right.

532
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:44.900
Moderator: Let me try.

533
00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:47.668
P7: Technology, technology, you gotta love it.

534
00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:52.759
Moderator: Yeah, it's just like not

535
00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:55.119
Moderator: holy cow. I'm gonna refresh it.

536
00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:57.759
P7: You do this every day.

537
00:47:58.950 --> 00:48:02.190
Moderator: Well, just during the study, not every day.

538
00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:05.220
P7: I mean you do studies a lot, though I mean yourself.

539
00:48:06.396 --> 00:48:10.120
Moderator: We do them like a few times a year. They're a big process.

540
00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:15.750
Moderator: Okay, I think it's letting me scroll down now. It's just being a little Wonky.

541
00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:20.200
Moderator: Alright, so take a look at the rest of this page. Here.

542
00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:21.630
P7: Okay.

543
00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:31.930
P7: okay, you go up.

544
00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:48.760
P7: Okay.

545
00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:52.549
Moderator: That's the bottom.

546
00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:02.059
P7: Okay, this is kind of self explanatory. So the key thing being that

547
00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:11.210
P7: like, then on this, that I see is what what if your application is denied, and what what are your options, and how do you go through that process? Which is.

548
00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:12.610
P7: you know.

549
00:49:12.810 --> 00:49:15.589
P7: probably the main part of this whole thing was.

550
00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:27.029
P7: if you're accepted, you're going to print it out, and you're going to have everything your your info. But in case you are denied, you need to find out what the process is.

551
00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:29.210
P7: what your options are.

552
00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:33.340
Moderator: Okay, so what do you think comes next in the process

553
00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:36.610
Moderator: after you see this Confirmation page.

554
00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:44.669
P7: I would imagine you're going to get a an email confirmation.

555
00:49:44.970 --> 00:49:49.997
P7: a follow up email, confirmation or something from the Va

556
00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:52.830
P7: you know

557
00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:54.786
P7: about your

558
00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:58.926
P7: entrance into the into the program, or and

559
00:49:59.756 --> 00:50:03.419
P7: what can be where you're going to hear who you're

560
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.027
P7: want to hear from next. So whether it be or

561
00:50:08.073 --> 00:50:09.220
P7: you know

562
00:50:09.610 --> 00:50:14.389
P7: the facility you're you were directed to, or the

563
00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:19.839
P7: the group that manages that facilities. I I would imagine you're going to hear from somebody.

564
00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:23.919
P7: you know, as far as what's the next step.

565
00:50:24.590 --> 00:50:28.949
P7: How do you begin? How do you begin your journey with the Va.

566
00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:30.720
Moderator: Okay.

567
00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:34.829
Moderator: And is there anything that you'd want to see here that you don't.

568
00:50:37.276 --> 00:50:44.780
P7: No, because you you kind of hit the, you know, touch base on every little kind of thing here that you would, really

569
00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:56.430
P7: you. You can't expect any more than what you have here, because until somebody contacts you, you really don't know where you're going and what's how it's going to start until somebody.

570
00:50:56.530 --> 00:51:00.480
P7: you know, once you're in the system, you know, you start the system right?

571
00:51:01.410 --> 00:51:05.849
P7: Okay? So that's that's how I feel about it. I think you know you'd be

572
00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:10.080
P7: once, you know, like everything is confirmed. Your information is correct.

573
00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:14.520
P7: They've, you know, either accepted or denied your application.

574
00:51:14.550 --> 00:51:19.470
P7: you know. Let's say they accepted it. Now you're going to get some kind of a confirmation from

575
00:51:19.570 --> 00:51:23.620
P7: okay, we're going to expect you to be able to. Here's a

576
00:51:24.043 --> 00:51:46.389
P7: here's a monthly, you know. Whatever calendar or schedule for appointments. When would you like? When can we make your 1st appointment? And you know whether it be an intake, you know. It's your 1st 1st thing where you come in and have it like an intake and evaluation. That's all you've got. You got to kind of wait for them. The balls in their court at that point.

577
00:51:47.170 --> 00:51:47.800
Moderator: Okay.

578
00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:57.010
Moderator: great. Thank you. So much for that feedback. I'm gonna stop sharing my screen. Now. I just have a couple of final questions for you, and then we're we're all done.

579
00:51:57.490 --> 00:51:58.250
P7: Okay.

580
00:51:58.250 --> 00:51:59.139
Moderator: On time.

581
00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:00.790
P7: Yeah, fine.

582
00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:08.439
Moderator: Okay, so what research do you think you would have wanted to do before applying and completing a form like this?

583
00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:18.560
P7: my research would have been on the the actual veterans end of getting making sure I have

584
00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:25.670
P7: all his proper information, so I would have got like. I said I would want to go to a website there with their website.

585
00:52:26.507 --> 00:52:28.390
P7: you know, like

586
00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:32.210
P7: and look for something says what I need.

587
00:52:32.490 --> 00:52:53.009
P7: What will you need to fill out this application with some kind of a list? Just like if I, if I want to go get a driver's license. I need 6 forms of identification, you know. I would like to see some kind of a list of things that you need. I could get off the website, then acquire those things with the veteran or with the family.

588
00:52:55.190 --> 00:53:04.580
P7: make sure I have all my ducks in line, you know. Then go back to the website, enter all the things, make sure I have everything that I need, the 1st 10 things I need.

589
00:53:04.887 --> 00:53:09.090
P7: Then let me make sure I have all 10. Don't go back on there and waste time.

590
00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:14.549
P7: you know, until I know that I have everything that's required of me, and then I think it's with

591
00:53:15.130 --> 00:53:24.100
P7: you. You see, I went through that pretty easy blind. So I mean I I think it's very doable for the average person.

592
00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:30.229
P7: and even even me with little patience. But like, if I was concentrating, it was on a big screen, and

593
00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:33.976
P7: I probably would have caught that period. But you know.

594
00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:46.590
P7: it's just like anything else. I think you got to be well prepared before you attempt to do stuff like this. And the biggest problem with veterans are, and I'll tell you, honest to God, truth.

595
00:53:47.010 --> 00:53:48.820
P7: they hate this kind of stuff.

596
00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:52.880
P7: That's why they don't do it. That's why they get somebody like me to do it

597
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:54.640
P7: because they hate it.

598
00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:58.969
P7: They absolutely deter and hate this process.

599
00:53:59.140 --> 00:54:03.779
P7: They just want to be taken care of. They served our country. Why can't somebody just

600
00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:09.795
P7: get me in there and get to take care of me? They they hate this process and

601
00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:17.049
P7: because it's a daunting thing they don't have. They don't want to be bothered with all this, they just want to be taken care of, so

602
00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:18.519
P7: the easier

603
00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:22.619
P7: and accessible you can make it for those who do wind up

604
00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:27.219
P7: sitting through. This is, and I I see

605
00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:44.900
P7: great efforts in a lot of different directions with Dva, and you know, with care and the ability to pick doctors. And you know, stuff that's been changing in the Va. So it's an evolving thing it's always going to be. There's always going to be

606
00:54:44.940 --> 00:54:48.800
P7: little bugs in the system, but it's getting so much better

607
00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:56.010
P7: and the simpler we can make it for for families and and veterans to get the help they need.

608
00:54:56.290 --> 00:54:58.920
P7: You know, there's something it'll be for everybody.

609
00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:03.159
P7: You know. The actual care is not. The problem is getting the care.

610
00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:06.060
P7: qualifying for the care. And you know.

611
00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:08.809
Moderator: Yeah, thank you so much for that feedback.

612
00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:16.440
Moderator: What were your thoughts on the amount of information provided in this form? Did you think it was too much too little, or just.

613
00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:18.555
P7: No, no, I actually I thought it was

614
00:55:21.110 --> 00:55:29.850
P7: very underwhelming. It wasn't overwhelming at all. There was no no thing of it that I thought was a long drawn out kind of experience.

615
00:55:29.970 --> 00:55:39.560
P7: I thought it was pretty quick and straightforward. It was like, if you came in prepared to do this. Boom! Boom! Boom! You could. You could have this done like 1015 min, and you're out, you know.

616
00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:46.360
P7: you know. But you know, be prepared like anything else. Be prepared before you sit down to do it, and then you'll get through it.

617
00:55:47.570 --> 00:55:48.260
Moderator: Okay.

618
00:55:48.711 --> 00:55:56.000
Moderator: Is there any additional information about who qualifies to be a primary or a secondary caregiver that you would like to see in this form.

619
00:55:57.710 --> 00:55:58.740
P7: Oh.

620
00:55:58.940 --> 00:56:15.359
P7: no, I don't think I'm like qualified to say who should be or could be. It's really it's up to the veteran for them to designate the person they feel most confident in. And as long as they're they have their wits about them and their their cognitive and their decision making.

621
00:56:15.590 --> 00:56:22.389
P7: It's up to them to put the person forward. They think it is in the best interest of them to get help with

622
00:56:22.805 --> 00:56:31.980
P7: like, I said. If it's a do or die situation, it's always going to be blood and family. But sometimes there's other people that have some experience in the process

623
00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:38.370
P7: where the family doesn't. Then it can, kinda like, you know, expedite this thing a little quicker, and

624
00:56:39.534 --> 00:56:41.390
P7: having been through it.

625
00:56:42.010 --> 00:56:46.830
P7: you know, already myself, but obviously take on another caregiver Guy.

626
00:56:47.146 --> 00:57:00.769
P7: I would have no qualms. It wouldn't intimidate me one second, you know, to represent more than 1, 2, or 3 different veterans. It wouldn't matter to me if they have confidence in me that I can help them. That's what I like to do, so

627
00:57:01.050 --> 00:57:02.710
P7: I think everything is.

628
00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:05.631
P7: Believe me, this is getting so much better.

629
00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:12.029
P7: My hat's off to the people that you know. Try to simplify this and streamline it. It's

630
00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:17.269
P7: you just have to realize when I give you the intake I'm giving you. I'm telling you. Veterans hate this.

631
00:57:17.370 --> 00:57:22.910
P7: They hate this rigmarole of what they have to go through to get the things they deserve.

632
00:57:23.060 --> 00:57:27.329
P7: and they, and rightly so they think. You know I said, my country, I deserve.

633
00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:34.459
P7: You know. I gotta come 1st and they, you know, they put themselves up a little high on the pedestal, but

634
00:57:34.850 --> 00:57:45.669
P7: they just have a hard time with all this paperwork. It's a daunting thing. And why do I gotta explain this? And, oh, my God, I I gotta look up this, and you know.

635
00:57:45.830 --> 00:57:50.829
P7: just make it for them the better it is for everyone. So.

636
00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:54.960
P7: But yeah, I thank the Va. And and and

637
00:57:55.580 --> 00:58:02.670
P7: for years they didn't do a lot or enough. Let's put it that way. And now there's been a really concerted effort.

638
00:58:02.690 --> 00:58:10.879
P7: and people like me that are kind of involved in it. See it so just so. People know that we we do recognize the

639
00:58:11.180 --> 00:58:15.389
P7: the things that are about, how things are going forward in a positive manner. So

640
00:58:16.190 --> 00:58:18.412
P7: you know, put that in the report.

641
00:58:19.408 --> 00:58:20.482
P7: We see it.

642
00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:28.409
Moderator: Yeah, really appreciate the feedback. And it's great to hear from you. You know, someone who interacts with so many other veterans that's really helpful.

643
00:58:28.820 --> 00:58:35.580
Moderator: I just wanna circle back and reconfirm. Are you comfortable? If we were to use a video clip of this session with our V 8 partners

644
00:58:35.620 --> 00:58:38.220
Moderator: removing any identifying information.

645
00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:41.619
P7: I'm perfectly okay with that.

646
00:58:41.780 --> 00:58:42.650
P7: Come on.

647
00:58:43.170 --> 00:58:46.769
Moderator: Is there any part of our discussion you wouldn't want shared in a video book.

648
00:58:48.260 --> 00:58:53.060
P7: No problem with any of it. It's open book. Take whatever you need to use.

649
00:58:53.610 --> 00:58:53.955
Moderator: Okay.

650
00:58:54.420 --> 00:59:00.050
Moderator: well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us. That feedback is so helpful

651
00:59:00.180 --> 00:59:01.990
Moderator: so we can keep improving it.

652
00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:03.750
P7: You and thank you guys for your

653
00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:11.959
P7: thank you for your hard work and what you're doing to make things better. Believe me, it's it's appreciated. When I tell some of the guys at the

654
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:16.230
P7: American League things. Would they be had? They asked me all the time.

655
00:59:16.290 --> 00:59:21.860
P7: You know, this is like the 3rd or 4th one I've done in in like the last couple of years or so. So

656
00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:24.739
P7: you know they've always asked me, are they coming.

657
00:59:28.455 --> 00:59:31.380
Moderator: Well, we really appreciate it, Peregee. And

658
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:45.159
Moderator: so the invite for this is also going to send you an email with a Thank you, and there will be a little blurb in there that you can pass along to other veterans and caregivers. If you know anyone who might want to participate in research studies like this.

659
00:59:46.550 --> 00:59:47.210
P7: Great.

660
00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:49.520
Moderator: Great. Thank you so much.

661
00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:50.400
P7: You so much.

662
00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:51.140
Moderator: Rest of your day.

663
00:59:51.140 --> 00:59:53.919
P7: You have a great day. Thank you again. Bye-bye.
