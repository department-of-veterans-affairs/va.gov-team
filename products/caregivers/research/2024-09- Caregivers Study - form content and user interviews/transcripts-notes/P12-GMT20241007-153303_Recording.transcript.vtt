00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:03.540
P12: Okay.

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:09.770
Moderator: Alright. I started recording. So just like to confirm, are you comfortable? If I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

3
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.000
P12: I am.

4
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:18.710
Moderator: And are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with our Va partners removing any identifying information.

5
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:20.060
P12: I am.

6
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.010
Moderator: Okay, thank you so much.

7
00:00:22.425 --> 00:00:28.920
Moderator: So before we take a look at that application form online that I was telling you about, I have a few

8
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.079
Moderator: questions about your application experience. So

9
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.690
Moderator: think my notes say that you're not enrolled in the

10
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.240
Moderator: caregiver program. Is that correct?

11
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.560
P12: That's correct. I I tried to enroll in it, but the

12
00:00:46.930 --> 00:01:10.989
P12: frankly, the form was so confusing that I just went away from it. I did do a couple caregiver programs with the community, with our, with the county. They have a they had a couple sessions last year, and the year before that I did 2 online programs about 6 weeks, 8 weeks long. So.

13
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.360
Moderator: Okay. Do you know, if that was related to the Va.

14
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.540
P12: No, it wasn't. It was related to the county.

15
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:18.739
Moderator: Gotcha. Okay.

16
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.729
P12: Just you know, they were doing reaching out to people, and

17
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.289
P12: I got word of it and signed up for both of those.

18
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:29.510
Moderator: Okay?

19
00:01:30.287 --> 00:01:35.780
Moderator: But you have heard of the Va caregiver program. Correct? Yes. Okay.

20
00:01:36.185 --> 00:01:40.430
Moderator: Have you ever interacted with the Va for family member benefits.

21
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.720
P12: only as far as far as P12 goes. I mean.

22
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.819
P12: I help with you know, doing his benefits well.

23
00:01:53.274 --> 00:01:57.020
P12: And also you got the Champ Va. I know I'm

24
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.970
P12: she said. Family, not me. Well, I'm fam your family.

25
00:02:04.294 --> 00:02:08.889
P12: I just signed up for Champ va.

26
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.960
Moderator: Okay.

27
00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.080
P12: My part of the health

28
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.330
P12: thing, but.

29
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.420
Moderator: Gotcha! How was your experience? Signing up for that.

30
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.079
P12: Could have struggled. It was a struggle

31
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.720
P12: actually signing up for it, doing the paperwork to get into it

32
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.695
P12: easy, because I filled in the paperwork. I took it down to our

33
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:42.909
P12: the Bso. The veteran service officer here in Concord, and she submitted it

34
00:02:43.643 --> 00:02:48.479
P12: through their fax thing to where it needed to go.

35
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.279
P12: but it just took

36
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.390
P12: forever

37
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.550
P12: for them to come back with.

38
00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:03.969
P12: you know, saying that I was involved in it. So we ended up, we had to. We ended up getting

39
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.990
P12: well, basically speaking. The Vso was told.

40
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.639
P12: this is a email or a a fax thing to a portal

41
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:20.730
P12: to to get it right in to get the champion. Well, after nothing happened, she made a couple of calls.

42
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.060
P12: and

43
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.949
P12: the champag says we don't have any porthole. It just goes into an email thing.

44
00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:28.300
Moderator: Hmm.

45
00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.989
P12: So it was. It was a struggle.

46
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.420
P12: Okay, but I'm finally in.

47
00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:37.630
Moderator: Okay.

48
00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.069
Moderator: I'm sorry to hear that. Thank you for the feedback, though.

49
00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.659
Moderator: as we do work closely with the team that works on that form as well.

50
00:03:46.018 --> 00:03:47.810
P12: I understand that they were

51
00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.630
P12: really behind. That's what the every time I called about it.

52
00:03:53.285 --> 00:03:58.810
P12: They said. You know that they were like months behind in their applications.

53
00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.640
Moderator: Okay, the Va. You mean, okay, gotcha

54
00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:11.210
Moderator: so in your own words, if you were to describe what it means to be a veteran caregiver. How would you describe it?

55
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.695
P12: Well, it's really

56
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.879
P12: doing everything I can

57
00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:21.770
P12: to make like life easier for him.

58
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.940
P12: He's legally blind.

59
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.049
P12: so as far as his computer goes.

60
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:35.359
P12: If he has a computer problem, then I try to help him as much as I can get out of that problem.

61
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:43.353
P12: I drive him to all of his appointments and do like I said, do whatever I can to

62
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:53.286
P12: make life. Oh, I got a better. I got a pinched nerve he's got. Yeah, he's got a pinched sciatic nerve which he's had.

63
00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.500
P12: He's got a spinal cord stimulator

64
00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:58.760
P12: implanted in his back.

65
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.509
P12: and now he's got another

66
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.729
P12: thing implanted in his leg.

67
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.170
P12: and so trying to get those 2 things to work

68
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:19.550
P12: together is an issue, and also getting the thing on his leg. I have to help him do that. He wants to show you his leg, see his leg. Can you see it.

69
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:21.480
P12: That's the.

70
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.960
Moderator: I'm partner.

71
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.760
P12: Have that antenna right over the wires. I can't see to do that.

72
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.509
P12: He can't see to do it, and then

73
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:37.850
P12: the you have to turn it on, and the signal that is a little little beep, beep, beep, beep.

74
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:51.550
P12: and he can't hear that, because it's it's on his leg, and it's just too far away from him to hear it. So I have to hear that, and then turn down and then get it to the program. So it's all little things like that.

75
00:05:51.720 --> 00:06:01.720
P12: I mean he doesn't. He's not to the point where he needs help taking a shower or beating himself anything like that. But she does say you're not wearing that with that.

76
00:06:02.515 --> 00:06:04.089
Moderator: Someone has to.

77
00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:04.920
P12: To help him.

78
00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:08.679
P12: I'm sure if you're married it's the same way.

79
00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.990
P12: Everybody.

80
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.195
Moderator: Yep.

81
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:13.700
P12: See

82
00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:19.000
P12: in my condition you got to be real careful. When you're buying shoes. You gotta pay

83
00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.240
P12: the same thing all the time.

84
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.020
P12: because when this 1st happened, when I went to Augusta to the

85
00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:27.980
P12: Brc.

86
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.039
P12: I had 2 different sneakers. On.

87
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.940
P12: One was a gray one was a black 1, 1 was a blue one.

88
00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:40.830
Moderator: Oh.

89
00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:43.469
Moderator: I guess you were comfortable, that's all that matters.

90
00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:44.360
P12: That's right.

91
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.220
P12: They didn't say anything. Yeah. They probably didn't even know what I figured.

92
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:55.089
Moderator: Hi, Tammy, are you able to hear? Okay, I see you're joined on like 2 different accounts.

93
00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:08.420
Tamara Scott: Yes, it's been a process I could hear, not hear here, not here. Sorry I can hear you all now, so thank you. Oh, and I thought I closed the other one out so. But I'm not gonna touch anything, because I'm afraid I'm gonna mess it up.

94
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.579
Moderator: Yeah, there's 1 of you.

95
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:19.059
Moderator: Tammy works at our caregiver office, at the Va. And she's just observing today.

96
00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:31.490
Moderator: so if you wanted to learn about benefits like the program of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers. How would you like to learn about that?

97
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.120
P12: Well.

98
00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.870
P12: I'd like to. I'd actually like to have something printed.

99
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:46.149
P12: You know, a a document, a booklet something in print, so that I can sit

100
00:07:46.210 --> 00:08:00.270
P12: comfortably and read through it, and then be able to go online and do whatever I need to do, fill in whatever documents I need to fill in and access it that way. Because I'm

101
00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:11.550
P12: I spent 30 years working on a computer. And so I'm I'm tired of sitting in front of a computer screen. So I'd much rather have something in print

102
00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:13.889
P12: that I can look at

103
00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:21.870
P12: and read and highlight and write my little questions on the side and go ahead that way. It's easier for me.

104
00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:23.070
Moderator: Gotcha.

105
00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:29.990
Moderator: And if you were completing a form to apply for caregiver benefits like the one that we're going to go through today.

106
00:08:30.383 --> 00:08:34.330
Moderator: What information do you think that you would need before completing the form.

107
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:47.850
P12: Well, let's see, certainly my name and address, and my spouse's name and his, both of our social security numbers, or his Va. File number.

108
00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:48.890
P12: Pardon me.

109
00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:54.590
P12: I don't know whether I would need a copy of a Dd. 214

110
00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:57.750
P12: and you know

111
00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.650
P12: that's probably the information that I would need.

112
00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.040
Moderator: Okay.

113
00:09:04.409 --> 00:09:08.839
Moderator: Alright. So I'm going to put a link in the zoom chat.

114
00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:09.500
P12: Okay.

115
00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.909
Moderator: Let me know if you need any help. Finding that.

116
00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:16.450
P12: There's a link right here. Don't click on it.

117
00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:18.799
Moderator: You can go ahead and click on it.

118
00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:27.370
Moderator: and then, once you have it open I'd like you to share your screen with me in Zoom. Let me know if you need any help doing that.

119
00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:28.420
P12: Probably will.

120
00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:29.590
Moderator: No problem.

121
00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:31.359
P12: So I've opened it.

122
00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:32.350
Moderator: Okay.

123
00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:34.920
P12: And so now, how do I share that with you?

124
00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:38.869
Moderator: So if you go back to the zoom window, where you can see me.

125
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:41.330
P12: Lost you!

126
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:45.360
P12: Where are you?

127
00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.160
P12: There you are right!

128
00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:53.210
P12: Alright!

129
00:09:53.504 --> 00:09:57.329
Moderator: In the zoom window. There should be like a toolbar on the bottom.

130
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:03.860
P12: Okay, there.

131
00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:08.040
Moderator: So you're looking for a button that is green that says, Share.

132
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:09.959
P12: Okay, click on that.

133
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:16.440
Moderator: Yeah, and then it will let you select what window you want to share with me. So if you can just select that one where the form is open.

134
00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:32.380
P12: Find that window

135
00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:57.859
P12: right there. So let me just go back. And

136
00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.190
P12: that's true.

137
00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:51.120
P12: I'm trying.

138
00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.259
Moderator: Do you? Were you able to find the share button.

139
00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:03.253
P12: Yes, I found it. But let me just

140
00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.400
P12: have you got it?

141
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.310
P12: No.

142
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:39.060
Moderator: And what do you see when you click that button? Oh, okay, I think it's starting.

143
00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:41.579
P12: Yeah, that that goes back to the same thing.

144
00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:45.469
P12: It's way over on the right hand side.

145
00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.240
P12: and

146
00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:48.949
P12: of course she's doing it. But

147
00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:50.690
P12: people that can't see

148
00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:52.829
P12: they don't look way over there.

149
00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:58.019
P12: They figure all the important information is on the left hand side, because that's where they look.

150
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.600
Moderator: Oh, what are you referring to? Being on the right side.

151
00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:03.670
P12: Sure bud.

152
00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:04.960
Moderator: Oh, okay.

153
00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:06.070
Moderator: yeah.

154
00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:12.640
Moderator: I know we always have a little trouble unless you're someone who uses zoom all the time. So.

155
00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:14.450
P12: Right, and I don't.

156
00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:15.570
Moderator: Yeah.

157
00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:19.900
Moderator: appreciate your patience. I see it now. So we're good.

158
00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:20.890
P12: Okay.

159
00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:26.699
Moderator: So I'd just like you to review this page and then tell me what your initial thoughts are, and

160
00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:30.820
Moderator: what you think about the form before going forward and applying.

161
00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.260
P12: Okay.

162
00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:48.018
P12: I'm I understand all of that. Let me just ask you a couple questions where it says,

163
00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:50.350
P12: that you have to.

164
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:56.360
P12: If you're a representative signing this application on behalf of the veteran which

165
00:14:57.130 --> 00:15:10.020
P12: I am, I guess that's what you'll need to submit a document showing you have legal authority to make decisions for the veteran like a power of attorney, legal guardianship, order, or other legal document. Now I have

166
00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:13.360
P12: through the Va. I've signed their

167
00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:16.590
P12: form that says they can tell me all of his

168
00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:19.189
P12: information, or they can talk to me.

169
00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:30.100
P12: So I mean, we've done that form. I have that a copy of that if I need to. You know, upload that I don't know if if that's the document they're talking about.

170
00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:37.740
Moderator: Okay, well, that's good feedback. And we'll talk a little bit more about that when we get to that step of the form. Because I'm curious.

171
00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:42.809
Moderator: Any other, you know, if you know, like what the form is called, or anything like that.

172
00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:45.430
P12: I I

173
00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:49.350
P12: don't know, but I can get it very quickly. So okay.

174
00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:51.760
P12: I will. I can do that.

175
00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:55.364
P12: Okay, it's this seems pretty

176
00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:57.610
P12: self-explanatory.

177
00:15:58.010 --> 00:15:59.959
P12: you know. I understand

178
00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.380
P12: everything that's there. So.

179
00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:08.540
Moderator: Okay, does anything on this page stand out to you as being confusing or particularly helpful.

180
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:16.869
P12: I think the only thing is that's confusing is is that part about the

181
00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:19.879
P12: that I just talked about.

182
00:16:20.645 --> 00:16:21.230
Moderator: Okay.

183
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:30.170
P12: So I it says that you can learn more about the documents. You can submit so I could click on that and go there, I suppose, and and they would

184
00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:32.979
P12: hopefully walk me through that.

185
00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:34.570
Moderator: Okay.

186
00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:37.549
P12: Other than that. I I think I

187
00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:39.240
P12: got it.

188
00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:41.370
Moderator: Okay.

189
00:16:41.964 --> 00:16:56.229
Moderator: If you were to rate this page on a scale of one to 5, 1 being the worst and 5 being the best. How prepared and informed do you feel about the application you're about to begin based on the content on this page? And why would you give it that rating.

190
00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:59.979
P12: I would say, I'm a 4,

191
00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:03.669
P12: and it's it's really just because of that

192
00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:07.589
P12: signature, that

193
00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:11.649
P12: power of attorney or legal guardianship order, whatever it is you need

194
00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:12.540
P12: that.

195
00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:14.740
Moderator: Bad things.

196
00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:16.450
Moderator: Audience.

197
00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:17.640
Moderator: okay.

198
00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:18.560
Moderator: But.

199
00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:21.809
P12: Other than that. Everything, I think, is.

200
00:17:21.979 --> 00:17:24.099
P12: it's pretty self explanatory.

201
00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:25.460
Moderator: Okay.

202
00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:30.439
Moderator: So now, I'd like you to start the form as if you were applying for the program.

203
00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:46.520
Moderator: Okay? So I'm gonna have you fill out the form. You can. Just you can do real or fake information. It doesn't matter, because it's a testing site.

204
00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:53.939
Moderator: And I'll make sure that nothing that you put in here is shared with anyone else. So it's up to you. If it's easier to put real information. That is fine.

205
00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:55.259
P12: Yeah, it is.

206
00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:56.490
Moderator: Okay?

207
00:17:57.085 --> 00:18:01.210
Moderator: I'll give you like a fake social security number when we get to that step.

208
00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:08.030
Moderator: So just think aloud as you're going through the form. I want to hear about any reactions that you're having.

209
00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.920
P12: Okay. So the 1st thing was his name.

210
00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:11.655
P12: So

211
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:21.489
P12: They asked for his middle name and his. All of his stuff comes up with just his middle initial. So I typed in his

212
00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:22.779
P12: middle name.

213
00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:31.120
P12: and then he doesn't have a suffix like he's not a junior or the 3rd or anything. So now I'm on to his birthday.

214
00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.310
P12: which is

215
00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:34.970
P12: fine. Well.

216
00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:44.959
P12: 1948.

217
00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:47.419
P12: What's the buttons?

218
00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.290
P12: Really?

219
00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:53.309
P12: Okay, what's the veteran sex listed at birth?

220
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:54.920
P12: There's only 2

221
00:18:56.060 --> 00:19:00.459
P12: alright social security number. You want me to just put 1, 2, 3, 4.

222
00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:03.460
Moderator: You can do. 3, 2, 1.

223
00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:10.769
Moderator: It won't take like one. It won't take a sequential thing like that. But if you do 3, 2, 1,

224
00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:14.329
Moderator: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Then it will take it.

225
00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:21.680
Moderator: Okay.

226
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:26.030
Moderator: okay, you can keep going.

227
00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:29.119
P12: Veterans. Home address.

228
00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:37.060
P12: Okay? So again, we have, you know, fill in the form thing. So.

229
00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:41.609
P12: But you have to always check this, because that has us living in

230
00:19:42.775 --> 00:19:43.840
P12: Louisiana.

231
00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:49.529
P12: So you always have to check that. Sometimes it doesn't come up with a state at all.

232
00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.529
P12: Sometimes it just comes up with a phone.

233
00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:54.060
P12: So

234
00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:56.640
P12: counting.

235
00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:10.570
P12: okay.

236
00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:15.880
P12: well, that's that. So now, veteran contact information

237
00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.510
P12: veterans, primary phone number.

238
00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:22.480
P12: And that's our home phone.

239
00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:53.849
P12: Okay? So for alternate phone. I put in my

240
00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:55.440
P12: cell phone number.

241
00:20:55.930 --> 00:21:01.510
P12: okay, instead of his cell phone number, because I get all of his

242
00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:05.040
P12: appointment reminders.

243
00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:06.340
P12: And all of that.

244
00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:08.150
P12: Okay.

245
00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:10.269
P12: okay? And then

246
00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:12.730
P12: he has 2

247
00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:16.249
P12: email addresses. But

248
00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:20.159
P12: you usually normally use your P12, right?

249
00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:22.260
P12: So on whatever happens.

250
00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:30.970
P12: Okay? And so I put in his email address.

251
00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:32.440
P12: yeah.

252
00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:34.170
P12: continue on

253
00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:37.689
P12: be a medical center or a clinic

254
00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:39.730
P12: does the va.

255
00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:06.779
Moderator: And why did you select that one.

256
00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:08.170
P12: Pardon me.

257
00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:10.580
Moderator: Why'd you select that facility.

258
00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:14.449
P12: Okay? Cause that's where he gets all of his

259
00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:19.349
P12: 90%. 90% of his healthcare comes from. There.

260
00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:20.340
Moderator: Okay.

261
00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:26.059
P12: He gets a little bit from North Charlotte. He has dental at North Charlotte.

262
00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:28.040
P12: and

263
00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:30.530
P12: sometimes

264
00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:32.000
P12: South Charlotte

265
00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:37.269
P12: No. South. Charlotte is where he gets his dental.

266
00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:49.929
P12: and North Charlotte is once in a while he gets vision there, but primary his primary care, doctor and all of his health. Things are at the Salisbury, Va.

267
00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:57.819
Moderator: Okay. So if you wanted to change the facility that you selected by doing a new search, could you walk me through? How you do that?

268
00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:01.190
P12: Sure, I just I

269
00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.512
P12: probably would put

270
00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:09.540
P12: back to the 1st block where it says City State.

271
00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:11.610
P12: where you get your

272
00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:14.559
P12: most of your care. I'd put in Charlotte

273
00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:17.740
P12: Parking.

274
00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:21.670
P12: I wanted to change it.

275
00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:30.109
P12: then hit the search, and it will come up with.

276
00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:33.479
P12: There's the South, Charlotte North Charlotte

277
00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:34.710
P12: Rock Hill.

278
00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:41.680
P12: and Bill Heffner is down here and then Hickory. So then I would just change it to South Charlotte.

279
00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:43.490
Moderator: Okay.

280
00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:48.530
Moderator: okay, continue.

281
00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:49.495
P12: Pretty

282
00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:51.840
P12: pretty simple.

283
00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:53.220
Moderator: Okay.

284
00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:57.349
P12: Confirm your health, care, facilities, veterans. Facility is selected.

285
00:23:57.530 --> 00:23:58.560
P12: Okay.

286
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:03.529
P12: so if I confirm that one.

287
00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:09.329
P12: your assigned caregiver support facility.

288
00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:16.989
P12: this is the facility we've assigned to support you in the application. So see, that's the one that I put in originally.

289
00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:19.839
Moderator: So what do you think about that.

290
00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:23.869
P12: I think that I should go back and change his to

291
00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:25.990
P12: be Salisbury.

292
00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:27.260
Moderator: Okay.

293
00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:29.329
P12: So can I do that.

294
00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:29.900
Moderator: Yep.

295
00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:32.349
P12: So let me go back and do that.

296
00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:51.980
P12: It was kind of a unique situation where Salisbury was just Salisbury at one time, and everybody went there, but then they put

297
00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:56.427
P12: 3 more clinics under Salisbury. They put

298
00:24:56.940 --> 00:25:01.299
P12: North Shore, South Charlotte, and what's the one up there in the

299
00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:06.130
P12: Kernersville, Kernersville, but they're all under all under Salisbury.

300
00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:08.520
Moderator: Okay?

301
00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:19.289
Moderator: So if you were to rate that process of selecting a Va facility, one to 5, 1 being the worst 5 being the best. What would you rate it, and why?

302
00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:24.549
P12: Say 5, because it's it's really pretty straightforward

303
00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:29.599
P12: especially if you I mean he's I think

304
00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:34.110
P12: he might be a little unique in that they don't have

305
00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:37.380
P12: all of the services at Salisbury that he needs.

306
00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:42.269
P12: Okay. And that's why he goes to the Charlotte

307
00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:47.210
P12: facility. So but most people, I think, get all of their

308
00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.189
P12: services at one.

309
00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:56.250
P12: you know, one Va. And up until he started with Dental. He really he really did.

310
00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:57.570
Moderator: Okay.

311
00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:04.790
P12: Yeah, that was a problem. That's he just said he could. We could have gotten him the dental

312
00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:14.750
P12: services at the Salisbury Va. But it would have been like a 6 month, 8 month. Wait for him to get in, even for his 1st appointment.

313
00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:15.660
Moderator: Okay.

314
00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:23.599
P12: So that's why we opted for the other facility. But as far as doing this, this form, this was

315
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.010
P12: a 5,

316
00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:27.100
P12: and it was. It was easy.

317
00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:28.110
Moderator: Okay.

318
00:26:29.387 --> 00:26:32.689
Moderator: What does the term primary caregiver mean to you?

319
00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:39.720
P12: Would you like to apply for benefits for a primary caregiver?

320
00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:42.070
P12: Okay, so

321
00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:44.530
P12: that would be me.

322
00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:48.899
P12: Okay. And

323
00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:53.100
P12: I guess I would like to apply

324
00:26:53.390 --> 00:27:01.749
P12: or benefits, and I would think I don't know but that might be where you could apply for Champ Va

325
00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:03.040
P12: or

326
00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:05.730
P12: this caregiver.

327
00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:08.450
Moderator: Okay.

328
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:10.810
Moderator: that's your expectation. Yeah.

329
00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:12.270
Moderator: okay.

330
00:27:13.285 --> 00:27:19.500
Moderator: so let's go through a scenario where you are adding yourself as the primary caregiver on the application.

331
00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:22.540
P12: Okay. So I just clicked. Yes.

332
00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:23.930
P12: right?

333
00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:25.330
Moderator: Yep.

334
00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:26.370
P12: And continue.

335
00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:27.640
P12: okay.

336
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.450
P12: So that's me.

337
00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:05.129
P12: okay. And I'm just going through and putting in my information.

338
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:07.590
P12: I'm up to my birthday.

339
00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:12.910
P12: which all of that is Bonnie Jane Breeze.

340
00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:16.309
P12: February 18, th 1947.

341
00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:19.810
P12: Okay, which is trying to make yourself younger. Yeah.

342
00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:21.740
P12: what's the primary fan

343
00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:25.179
P12: family caregivers, sex plus birth

344
00:28:27.719 --> 00:28:29.089
P12: veterans.

345
00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:32.560
P12: files.

346
00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:35.089
P12: There, that was easy.

347
00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:37.730
P12: Okay.

348
00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:39.640
P12: okay.

349
00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:46.170
P12: And my caregivers identification information. Okay? So now, it wants my social security number.

350
00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:50.589
P12: So do you want me to put that in, or do you want to give me one or.

351
00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:55.089
Moderator: Yeah, we can just do a different fake. One. So we'll do 3, 2, 1,

352
00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:58.140
Moderator: 4, 5, 6,

353
00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:02.199
Moderator: 7, 8, 8. Let's do

354
00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:03.910
Moderator: that. Should work.

355
00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:09.749
P12: They want me to put

356
00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:12.529
P12: dashes in there. And it was.

357
00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:17.550
P12: okay.

358
00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:21.639
P12: This is the veteran's home address. Use the same address as the veteran.

359
00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:22.940
P12: Yes.

360
00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:27.240
P12: okay.

361
00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:32.629
P12: Is the primary animal care that was mailing with us.

362
00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:34.659
P12: Same, better home.

363
00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:35.690
P12: Yes.

364
00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:38.580
P12: Okay. So that was very easy.

365
00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:40.620
P12: Same address.

366
00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:46.140
P12: Okay, primary family caregivers, contact information.

367
00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.470
P12: Enter a 10 digit phone number

368
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:56.030
P12: same time zone

369
00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:01.270
P12: myself.

370
00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:24.590
P12: Good.

371
00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:31.890
P12: So that's just asking for phone information and email. And that, too, is very simple.

372
00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:33.210
P12: Okay.

373
00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:34.850
Moderator: Keep going.

374
00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:36.140
Moderator: Okay?

375
00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:39.749
Moderator: And what does the secondary caregiver mean to you?

376
00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:44.070
P12: Secondary.

377
00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:47.639
P12: I don't know. I've never heard that term before.

378
00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:48.540
Moderator: Okay.

379
00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:58.270
Moderator: so any ideas about how that secondary role might differ in the application process and the benefits from the primary caregiver.

380
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:04.717
P12: other than like if

381
00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:07.899
P12: he needed somebody to

382
00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:14.419
P12: come in and help him take a shower or help him.

383
00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:18.790
P12: you know, do something, some daily activity.

384
00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:21.469
P12: I would think that would be a secondary

385
00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:23.600
P12: family caregiver.

386
00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:24.930
Moderator: Okay.

387
00:31:26.123 --> 00:31:30.789
Moderator: let's go through as though we are adding a secondary caregiver to the application.

388
00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:39.109
P12: Okay? Where it says, learn more about who qualifies as a secondary family. Can I click on that to see what information is there.

389
00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:40.070
Moderator: Yep.

390
00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:53.690
P12: Okay, yeah, that's

391
00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:01.169
P12: that's what I would think. The problem is like, we don't have any children.

392
00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:04.420
P12: And all of our parents have passed away.

393
00:32:05.248 --> 00:32:07.440
P12: We would just have.

394
00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:13.709
P12: you know, friends, we would have a couple friends, a friend and a neighbor, probably.

395
00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:14.500
Moderator: Okay.

396
00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:15.160
P12: Okay.

397
00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:18.778
P12: But that answers my question, that that

398
00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:28.192
P12: I would have checked that if I was doing this on my own I would have clicked that to find out what exactly it means, and then

399
00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:32.690
P12: I would go in and check. Yes, I want to apply for benefits.

400
00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:34.210
Moderator: Okay.

401
00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:37.729
P12: Go on secondary care. Okay.

402
00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:08.840
P12: okay, so I'm

403
00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:12.660
P12: doing her birthday now.

404
00:33:13.375 --> 00:33:13.850
P12: So

405
00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:16.389
P12: which is really

406
00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:19.099
P12: her birthday, is the same day as mine.

407
00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:20.270
Moderator: No.

408
00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:21.259
P12: Different year.

409
00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:24.109
Moderator: That's cool.

410
00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:24.940
P12: It is

411
00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:43.559
P12: okay. So that, too, is

412
00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:46.640
P12: is fairly self explanatory.

413
00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:49.990
P12: Once you understand what secondary family caregiver is.

414
00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:51.529
P12: piece of cake.

415
00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:53.660
Moderator: Okay, and keep going.

416
00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:56.779
P12: Okay. Social security. Number.

417
00:33:57.890 --> 00:33:58.950
P12: Okay.

418
00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:00.870
P12: 3, 2, 1.

419
00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:05.120
Moderator: 3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6,

420
00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:07.610
Moderator: 7,

421
00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:09.670
Moderator: 8, 7.

422
00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:16.360
Moderator: Hold my number, any number.

423
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:20.739
Moderator: It just has to be the right amount of numbers, and it can't be sequential

424
00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:24.139
Moderator: that should that should work.

425
00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:26.429
P12: Okay.

426
00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:34.270
P12: this is the veteran's home address. Use the same address as the veteran. Well, no, she doesn't live here, so

427
00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:40.140
P12: it can't be a post office box. So I'll have to just

428
00:34:57.570 --> 00:34:58.320
P12: perfect.

429
00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:16.750
P12: Okay? So I put in her name and address.

430
00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:19.240
P12: lives in the same county.

431
00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:31.660
P12: Okay.

432
00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:35.769
P12: so that's that's pretty easy.

433
00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:38.539
Moderator: Yep, you can keep going.

434
00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:39.230
P12: Okay.

435
00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:42.999
P12: Contact information. Oh, boy.

436
00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:58.810
P12: I'm just looking up her phone number so that I can

437
00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:01.920
P12: put it in.

438
00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:05.759
Moderator: I'm gonna blow my nose real quick. But I'm here.

439
00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:06.766
P12: That's fine.

440
00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:45.300
P12: Say, she thought I was calling her.

441
00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:50.530
P12: Oh, dear.

442
00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:58.750
P12: I'm sorry! Let me just make sure that she's.

443
00:36:58.750 --> 00:36:59.660
Moderator: Yeah. Go ahead.

444
00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:11.290
P12: Let me just tell her that I made a mistake.

445
00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:15.590
Moderator: No problem and let her know we're not sharing her number with anyone.

446
00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:17.180
P12: Sandra

447
00:37:18.350 --> 00:37:19.280
P12: Sandra.

448
00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:25.350
P12: Yeah, I'm sorry I I made a mistake. I'm trying to fill in a form. And

449
00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:30.597
P12: and I made a mistake and pushed the wrong button. So I didn't mean to call you.

450
00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:34.030
P12: Yep, everything's okay. Thank you.

451
00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:38.400
P12: I'll talk with you later. All right. Okay, love you love you, too. Bye, bye.

452
00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:42.600
P12: Okay.

453
00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:47.429
P12: all right. Now, I'm back.

454
00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:55.180
P12: No, it was standard. Oh, that was it.

455
00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:56.500
P12: Yeah. Yeah.

456
00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:03.380
P12: Curious to see if they let them in

457
00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:06.170
P12: supplies.

458
00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:07.480
P12: Yeah.

459
00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:11.450
P12: okay, so I did that.

460
00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:20.999
Moderator: Okay, if you were completing this form online for real, how would you coordinate getting all of that information from everyone involved?

461
00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:29.809
P12: I would actually have all of that information on my phone with.

462
00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:35.316
P12: And so I would have it listed. The only thing I wouldn't have would be his

463
00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:41.780
P12: if I needed to enter in his case number, and I would have to go look that up.

464
00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:42.970
Moderator: Okay.

465
00:38:44.066 --> 00:38:48.640
Moderator: so you wouldn't feel like you needed to sit down and do this together

466
00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:50.270
Moderator: so far.

467
00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:51.220
Moderator: No.

468
00:38:51.370 --> 00:38:52.230
Moderator: okay.

469
00:38:54.160 --> 00:39:01.810
Moderator: alright. So we can continue. Let's just say no to adding another secondary family caregiver

470
00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:08.450
Moderator: now. So.

471
00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:09.750
P12: Sign the application.

472
00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:12.690
P12: Okay.

473
00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:17.099
Moderator: I'm curious what you think this page is asking, and what it means to you.

474
00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:19.209
P12: Let me just read this.

475
00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:47.110
P12: Okay, so this goes back to that document that I talked about.

476
00:39:51.090 --> 00:39:55.359
P12: let me just check click on this, and see what documents they accept.

477
00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:56.350
Moderator: Okay.

478
00:39:57.090 --> 00:40:02.469
P12: Can only accept the document that proves they have legal authority to make the decisions.

479
00:40:02.590 --> 00:40:06.720
P12: We'll accept a document that proves you hear these already go outside.

480
00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:08.420
P12: We can't do that

481
00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:13.099
P12: valid power of attorney which I have that, too.

482
00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:16.839
P12: Another legal vacuum of that your State. Or

483
00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:18.729
P12: thank you.

484
00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:25.519
P12: Okay, that's the form. I think that I have alternate signer certification.

485
00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:27.160
Moderator: Gotcha.

486
00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:37.180
P12: Or it might be the next one. It might be either one of those 2. I'd have to go get that form, and then I can tell you. Want me to get that form.

487
00:40:38.298 --> 00:40:44.969
Moderator: If it's easy to get. If not, that's okay, like, it's good to know that you're kind of confused about which form it is.

488
00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:51.749
P12: Yeah, I can go get it. I just need to run upstairs. If you want me to do that, I will.

489
00:40:55.330 --> 00:41:02.695
Moderator: It's not. Honestly, it's not really necessary, but it's good to know, like what you would have to do if you going to do it.

490
00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:12.000
P12: I have. I mean, if one of those forms isn't the form that I have from the Va. I do have a valid power of attorney which I could

491
00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:15.890
P12: copy that upload that, too. So either way.

492
00:41:16.690 --> 00:41:23.679
Moderator: Gotcha. So if you were going to upload a document, what what type would of those? Do you think you would upload.

493
00:41:26.090 --> 00:41:28.970
P12: I well like. I said I would check those

494
00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:35.870
P12: to make sure. You know, if I had one of those document numbers that they're talking about there. I would upload that.

495
00:41:36.090 --> 00:41:42.009
P12: and then, if it wasn't 1 of those, then I would upload a copy of Power of Attorney.

496
00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:43.020
Moderator: Okay?

497
00:41:43.210 --> 00:41:47.869
Moderator: And do you have those like readily available digital copy that you would upload.

498
00:41:48.425 --> 00:41:50.150
P12: No, I would have to.

499
00:41:50.518 --> 00:41:55.770
P12: Make a copy. Usually. What I do is take a picture of it with my phone

500
00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:59.220
P12: and then send it to my email.

501
00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:01.500
P12: and then I

502
00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:04.260
P12: bring that to the I.

503
00:42:05.350 --> 00:42:08.019
P12: Usually I save it to my desktop.

504
00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:10.339
P12: and then I go to

505
00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:14.729
P12: upload, and it says, what document you want to upload, and I click on the

506
00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:17.729
P12: browser, and it brings up

507
00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:23.370
P12: my list. And I choose which one I want to upload and just click on that and it uploads it.

508
00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:24.600
Moderator: Okay.

509
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.359
P12: While to learn that, but I finally got that down.

510
00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:32.190
Moderator: Okay, that's perfect. That's good to know.

511
00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:32.870
P12: Okay.

512
00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:35.300
Moderator: Alright. Well.

513
00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:40.220
Moderator: if you want to upload a document in the form, then you can

514
00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:48.629
Moderator: select the second choice that you're a representative, or if you don't want to, you can select that you're the veteran, and then you won't be asked to do that.

515
00:42:49.090 --> 00:42:49.900
P12: Okay,

516
00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:53.670
P12: why don't I check that? I'm

517
00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:56.350
P12: a representative? Because then

518
00:42:56.590 --> 00:42:59.020
P12: I will know how to do that. Okay?

519
00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:06.859
P12: And then.

520
00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:20.270
P12: okay, so this is this is normal for uploading that. So I can. Let me just click on this upload file and see if I can

521
00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:23.810
P12: go. Okay, see? So this goes to his.

522
00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:30.490
P12: okay, I'll upload this.

523
00:43:39.730 --> 00:43:41.490
P12: Okay. So there's

524
00:43:41.590 --> 00:43:44.250
P12: that's what that's document that I uploaded.

525
00:43:44.650 --> 00:43:45.370
Moderator: Okay.

526
00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:48.120
P12: Okay. So that that was

527
00:43:48.350 --> 00:43:51.089
P12: that was just the way I expected it to be.

528
00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:52.470
Moderator: Okay.

529
00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:52.790
P12: Okay.

530
00:43:53.085 --> 00:43:56.340
Moderator: In your own words. What would you expect to happen next?

531
00:43:57.397 --> 00:44:01.600
P12: I would expect to go to a place where

532
00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:03.840
P12: I had to actually sign.

533
00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:06.240
Moderator: Okay.

534
00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:07.930
P12: So.

535
00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:09.260
Moderator: Yeah, you can keep going.

536
00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:14.060
P12: Oh, all right, review.

537
00:44:15.310 --> 00:44:17.930
P12: You always gotta redo it. Oh, yeah, I know it.

538
00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:20.190
P12: So

539
00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:25.160
P12: review all that, Charles, I agree.

540
00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:44.490
P12: Okay, so I have a mistake up there. So I'm gonna edit that.

541
00:44:44.490 --> 00:44:45.419
Moderator: Okay, go ahead.

542
00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:55.449
P12: Came back to Va. Medical Center.

543
00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:58.060
Moderator: Yeah, what are your thoughts about that.

544
00:44:58.890 --> 00:45:03.239
P12: That's not what I wanted to. I thought it would go back to the form

545
00:45:03.530 --> 00:45:06.149
P12: that I'm was reviewing.

546
00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:13.320
P12: That's what I should have. I expected because I wanted to edit. I put in the wrong day for his birthday.

547
00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:14.670
Moderator: Oh, okay.

548
00:45:15.550 --> 00:45:19.109
P12: So when I clicked I wanted to edit that form.

549
00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:22.189
P12: I would think it would go back to that form.

550
00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:28.140
Moderator: okay, let's click back. It might take you back to that

551
00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:30.599
Moderator: review, page okay.

552
00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:35.930
P12: Okay, see? So I put in december. It should be December 23, rd

553
00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:39.230
P12: at 1212. So

554
00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:40.959
P12: that's why I clicked at it.

555
00:45:41.830 --> 00:45:45.279
P12: If you click on the birthday it's easier. Let me just see.

556
00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:47.260
P12: no.

557
00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:53.290
P12: Okay. So I have to edit personal information.

558
00:45:59.550 --> 00:46:00.550
P12: Okay?

559
00:46:01.330 --> 00:46:02.140
P12: But

560
00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:07.420
P12: okay.

561
00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:09.680
P12: there.

562
00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:14.339
P12: okay. So there's little edits all the way through it.

563
00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:19.700
P12: and I just went to the bottom at the end of the form and clicked at it.

564
00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:23.440
P12: So that's why I ended up at the Medical Center.

565
00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:24.909
Moderator: Yeah, that is.

566
00:46:24.910 --> 00:46:25.710
P12: So that's.

567
00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:26.970
Moderator: We'll just see.

568
00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:31.790
P12: It's just because I read it too fast and didn't see all the other little edits in there.

569
00:46:31.970 --> 00:46:34.249
Moderator: Yeah, I'm sure it happens all the time.

570
00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:38.380
P12: Primary caregiver application. Okay.

571
00:46:38.610 --> 00:46:41.419
P12: so I'm just gonna go in and look at this.

572
00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:49.670
P12: Okay.

573
00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:58.460
P12: okay? So that all looks good.

574
00:47:21.210 --> 00:47:22.090
P12: Okay.

575
00:47:46.290 --> 00:47:48.890
P12: okay, so then I would sign

576
00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:51.670
P12: my name. There.

577
00:47:52.590 --> 00:47:53.930
Moderator: Yeah, you can go ahead and do that.

578
00:47:56.970 --> 00:47:57.840
P12: Now

579
00:48:00.130 --> 00:48:03.530
P12: like when I sign the forms for charging

580
00:48:03.968 --> 00:48:13.510
P12: they have a thing that you go to, and you, you know, type your name in, and that gives you a signature, so you don't have to click on it. And

581
00:48:13.890 --> 00:48:19.320
P12: does this have that? Or do I have to just try and write my name in there. I can.

582
00:48:20.629 --> 00:48:24.030
Moderator: Whatever you would try to do I would like to see.

583
00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:28.180
Moderator: And where did you say that that was like a form you were just talking about?

584
00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:32.349
P12: Yeah, when I filled in the form for pairing to do this.

585
00:48:32.350 --> 00:48:33.270
Moderator: Oh, okay.

586
00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:37.490
P12: Thing at the end you have, you have to sign it.

587
00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:39.759
P12: And so what I

588
00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:47.769
P12: would do, what they have is they have a thing that you can just click on. But this I'm just gonna type my name in there

589
00:48:54.570 --> 00:48:57.250
P12: on behalf of Charles I certify the information

590
00:48:57.290 --> 00:49:01.889
P12: above is correct and true to the best of my knowledge and belief. Absolutely

591
00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:20.870
P12: right. So I would

592
00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:23.390
P12: do the same thing here

593
00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:26.269
P12: because I am the primary caregiver.

594
00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:28.260
Moderator: Go ahead!

595
00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:48.610
Moderator: Oh.

596
00:49:59.850 --> 00:50:00.800
P12: Secondary.

597
00:50:20.970 --> 00:50:23.579
P12: I have to say, with all these things we've done.

598
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.940
P12: this one here seems to want be the one that has

599
00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:28.920
P12: at least one. It changes.

600
00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:30.650
P12: Well.

601
00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:34.469
P12: yeah, it's it seems to be the easiest.

602
00:50:35.970 --> 00:50:36.640
P12: Okay.

603
00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:39.130
P12: Pardon me.

604
00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:40.640
Moderator: This form you mean.

605
00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:41.420
P12: Yes.

606
00:50:42.088 --> 00:50:44.881
P12: the whole process, I mean.

607
00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:56.590
P12: I I don't think like when I filled in the information for champ va, for example. That had

608
00:50:56.630 --> 00:51:00.900
P12: some. But you you really didn't know who they were talking about

609
00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:03.748
P12: when it said, You know, are you the

610
00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:10.160
P12: I don't know what their words what the words were, but I couldn't tell her that they were talking about me or him.

611
00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:12.840
Moderator: Okay. But.

612
00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:17.759
P12: This. This seems this is much easier, much

613
00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:19.850
P12: more self-explanatory.

614
00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:21.940
Moderator: Okay, good to know.

615
00:51:22.326 --> 00:51:29.280
Moderator: I'm curious what your comfort level is with filling this out and signing without all of the people who are involved. Present.

616
00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:37.209
P12: I actually, I mean, I'm okay with it because

617
00:51:39.590 --> 00:51:44.040
P12: like I, for P12 lost his vision in 2,006.

618
00:51:44.090 --> 00:51:50.190
P12: So I've been doing forms and things for him since 2,006.

619
00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:52.850
P12: Okay, so I know what

620
00:51:53.800 --> 00:52:01.159
P12: I'm I know what I'm signing up for. I know what I'm doing, and as far as the secondary family caregiver.

621
00:52:01.537 --> 00:52:10.220
P12: She's a very close friend of ours, and she it's just like she called when I pushed the wrong button. She's the one that called.

622
00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:11.140
Moderator: No.

623
00:52:12.030 --> 00:52:14.840
P12: And so I mean I know that she would.

624
00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:16.135
P12: She's

625
00:52:17.350 --> 00:52:25.559
P12: She's 1 of the executors on our will, so I know that she would, you know, want me to do whatever I needed to do?

626
00:52:25.610 --> 00:52:27.030
P12: Put her name in there.

627
00:52:27.610 --> 00:52:29.249
Moderator: Okay, good to know.

628
00:52:30.269 --> 00:52:42.629
Moderator: Alright. So for the we can't actually submit it on here, it will just give you an error because it's a testing site. So I'm gonna share the final page that you would see if you did submit the application.

629
00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:45.690

P12: learn more about it.

648
00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:01.860
P12: 7. Okay.

649
00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:07.100
P12: Here's how you can learn more. Read the

650
00:54:07.930 --> 00:54:11.109
P12: program. General caregiver support services.

651
00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:15.159
P12: call the caregiver support button, find the caregiver support

652
00:54:15.410 --> 00:54:17.550
P12: team and Unspa

653
00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:20.960
P12: go to our caregiver support.

654
00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:22.040
P12: Okay.

655
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:32.950
P12: okay, so the team directory, what does that have on it? Just the people's names. And so you just don't know who, to

656
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:34.350
P12: matter of fact.

657
00:54:35.420 --> 00:54:40.799
P12: I mean, go to our customer. Our caregiver support program teams, directory.

658
00:54:43.450 --> 00:54:45.509
Moderator: What do you think that link would show you.

659
00:54:46.580 --> 00:54:48.360
P12: Think it would give you the name

660
00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:51.899
P12: of the people that are in the

661
00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:55.420
P12: team directory.

662
00:54:55.760 --> 00:55:00.403
P12: Once you pick, I I guess they well, you already picked the

663
00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:04.890
P12: team because it would be at the facility at the Salisbury facility.

664
00:55:04.930 --> 00:55:08.340
P12: So I would think it would give you the names of the people that are there

665
00:55:09.610 --> 00:55:10.740
P12: that are.

666
00:55:11.770 --> 00:55:14.080
P12: you know, the team support

667
00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:15.400
P12: numbers.

668
00:55:15.810 --> 00:55:16.490
Moderator: Okay?

669
00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:25.900
Moderator: So overall. Could you tell me what this page is telling you happened and what comes next in the process.

670
00:55:26.645 --> 00:55:27.100
P12: Sure

671
00:55:27.965 --> 00:55:31.090
P12: overall. They they send me

672
00:55:31.210 --> 00:55:34.689
P12: a confirmation that I've they've received

673
00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:39.989
P12: my application, and then they'll send me an email

674
00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:43.570
P12: if they.

675
00:55:44.850 --> 00:55:47.609
P12: if they're going to accept my application.

676
00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:51.974
P12: once they go through it and check it all out, then

677
00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:53.689
P12: they'll send me

678
00:55:54.020 --> 00:55:56.639
P12: either an acceptance or a denial.

679
00:55:57.080 --> 00:56:00.510
P12: and once I get the acceptance, then

680
00:56:01.130 --> 00:56:06.050
P12: that tells me, or pretty much, I go with that and continue on.

681
00:56:06.870 --> 00:56:07.620
P12: Yeah.

682
00:56:08.250 --> 00:56:10.330
P12: they'll that'll be the approval.

683
00:56:10.530 --> 00:56:11.570
P12: And then

684
00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:12.840
P12: I pantech

685
00:56:13.090 --> 00:56:16.131
P12: they'll tell me. I think it said that you

686
00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:17.890
P12: There's

687
00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:21.870
P12: the contact numbers are there. If you're

688
00:56:22.420 --> 00:56:24.259
P12: if I have any questions

689
00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:26.480
P12: I can go to that number.

690
00:56:26.630 --> 00:56:29.850
P12: but if it's denied, then they

691
00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:32.839
P12: tell me that I can, you know.

692
00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:38.410
P12: request a appeal, or if I disagree with a decision, I can

693
00:56:38.890 --> 00:56:45.079
P12: appeal it, or request a review of the decision and go on from there and then, if they approve it.

694
00:56:45.930 --> 00:56:47.010
P12: then I

695
00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:49.890
P12: they send me an email.

696
00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:53.490
Moderator: Okay.

697
00:56:55.053 --> 00:56:58.599
Moderator: Is there any information that you would like to see here that you don't.

698
00:57:02.650 --> 00:57:06.720
P12: No, I think just scroll down so I can see the next

699
00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:08.409
P12: part of this.

700
00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:09.520
P12: Okay.

701
00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:10.810
P12: so

702
00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:16.219
P12: window verification denied.

703
00:57:19.850 --> 00:57:21.207
P12: no, I guess.

704
00:57:21.970 --> 00:57:24.650
P12: you know it says if you have questions now.

705
00:57:25.385 --> 00:57:33.789
P12: So if I had, you know, if I needed to know more information, I guess I would go to our caregiver support Program

706
00:57:33.810 --> 00:57:49.351
P12: team directory and find out who's listed there and like what their position is, and see if you know, there's somebody there that I could contact. If, for example, it's been a long time since I received the

707
00:57:49.940 --> 00:57:58.620
P12: you know the fact that you all received it, or they received it, received my application, and I hadn't heard anything approval or denial.

708
00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:01.849
P12: Then I guess I would go there and find out.

709
00:58:02.310 --> 00:58:03.900
P12: you know, if they can help me

710
00:58:04.490 --> 00:58:07.130
P12: find out what, where, where it stands.

711
00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:08.529
P12: And then

712
00:58:09.690 --> 00:58:13.859
P12: I think you know, with those with that phone number, and that.

713
00:58:15.390 --> 00:58:19.459
P12: you know, go into the general caregiver support services

714
00:58:19.650 --> 00:58:22.039
P12: which I have not been to that site

715
00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:24.870
P12: to see. You know. What is there

716
00:58:26.010 --> 00:58:27.120
P12: other than

717
00:58:27.180 --> 00:58:35.480
P12: I don't know if that's the site I went to early on. When I when I 1st started to look at this, there were 2 types of

718
00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:43.160
P12: caregiver support that you could apply for one was with no compensation.

719
00:58:43.540 --> 00:58:56.739
P12: and one was with compensation. And so I didn't know. You know, it was pretty vague on what the differences were. So that's why I didn't go any further with that, because I didn't know whether I

720
00:58:56.980 --> 00:59:02.099
P12: I felt like I'd already done 2 programs about caregivers and how to interact with.

721
00:59:02.604 --> 00:59:09.210
P12: You know the person that you are caring for, and all the signs and things that you need to watch for.

722
00:59:09.490 --> 00:59:14.239
P12: So I felt well, you know I probably don't need to go through that again.

723
00:59:14.290 --> 00:59:16.889
P12: So I thought, Well, I'll just wait and see.

724
00:59:17.290 --> 00:59:18.839
P12: So I didn't bow any further.

725
00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:20.360
Moderator: Okay.

726
00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:23.800
P12: I do think that

727
00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:26.410
P12: you know I will look at.

728
00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:29.200
P12: If I had

729
00:59:29.650 --> 00:59:30.620
P12: the

730
00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:34.056
P12: the website information for

731
00:59:35.570 --> 00:59:38.209
P12: program of General Caregiver support.

732
00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:40.210
P12: Sarah listens.

733
00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:43.569
P12: If I had. If there was a website that I could go to.

734
00:59:44.650 --> 00:59:46.380
P12: I don't have that to click on.

735
00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:47.970
Moderator: Okay.

736
00:59:48.955 --> 00:59:54.419
Moderator: I can send you the link to actually apply for this program.

737
00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:55.090
P12: Okay.

738
00:59:55.090 --> 01:00:02.969
Moderator: If you don't qualify for it, then you will be able to talk to them about applying for the other program that you're correct. One has a stipend, and one doesn't

739
01:00:03.190 --> 01:00:03.850
Moderator: right.

740
01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:17.699
Moderator: So in the zoom chat, I put the link to va.gov, where you can read more about the application and eligibility, and you can start the application from there for real afterwards if you'd like.

741
01:00:19.350 --> 01:00:20.692
P12: Okay, is that

742
01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:25.050
P12: that's this right over here. Yeah.

743
01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:27.000
P12: okay, can you?

744
01:00:27.010 --> 01:00:29.640
P12: Is there any way you can send that to my email?

745
01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:35.600
Moderator: Yeah, I'll ask. I don't have your email, but I will ask Perig and to send it to you.

746
01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:37.169
P12: Okay, that would be great.

747
01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:38.090
Moderator: Sure!

748
01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:39.300
Moderator: Oh, nice!

749
01:00:39.830 --> 01:00:43.900
P12: Because I I can't do it right now, but I would like to.

750
01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:47.249
P12: I would like to go through and do that application.

751
01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:48.800
Moderator: Okay, sounds good.

752
01:00:50.348 --> 01:00:51.979
Moderator: So I'm just wondering.

753
01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:55.689
P12: Of your all of the stuff that we've gone through today

754
01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:56.840
P12: has

755
01:00:57.460 --> 01:01:02.890
P12: encouraged me to do the application. Okay, okay.

756
01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:08.160
P12: I I think it's well, like P12. It's enlightened me.

757
01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:09.650
Moderator: Okay.

758
01:01:09.890 --> 01:01:10.880
Moderator: gotcha.

759
01:01:11.470 --> 01:01:18.719
Moderator: I just have a couple of final questions, and then we are done. Do you have a couple of extra minutes because we're time already?

760
01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:19.640
P12: Absolutely.

761
01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:21.060
Moderator: Okay, thank you so much.

762
01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:23.559
P12: We got all the time in the world, if it'll help.

763
01:01:26.722 --> 01:01:34.070
Moderator: Okay, so I'm curious. Now that you've seen the form, what research do you think you would do before applying and completing a form like that?

764
01:01:34.750 --> 01:01:38.791
P12: I would check to make sure I have

765
01:01:39.490 --> 01:01:48.089
P12: that form that they went that says you either have power of attorney or you're authorized to sign for him.

766
01:01:48.370 --> 01:01:50.339
P12: I would make sure I had that

767
01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:56.889
P12: with me. I mean his social security number and all that other information I have top of my head.

768
01:01:58.180 --> 01:01:58.930
Moderator: Okay.

769
01:02:00.690 --> 01:02:07.519
Moderator: and what are your thoughts about the amount of information that was provided in the form? Did you think it was too much.

770
01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:09.570
Moderator: too little, or just enough.

771
01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:11.840
P12: actions.

772
01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:15.780
P12: I think it was it was just enough.

773
01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:19.710
P12: But I mean the forms itself.

774
01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:24.920
P12: I mean it wasn't. It really wasn't a lot of information.

775
01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:32.119
P12: It's just you. There's a number of steps. So if it, you know, I I thought it was really

776
01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:35.550
P12: just the right amount of information that they're asking.

777
01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:36.900
Moderator: Okay.

778
01:02:37.210 --> 01:02:44.400
Moderator: is there any additional information that you would have liked to see about, who qualifies to be a primary and a secondary caregiver?

779
01:02:45.298 --> 01:02:47.949
P12: Yeah, I I think that would be

780
01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:52.590
P12: really helpful to define that.

781
01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:55.420
Moderator: Okay.

782
01:02:55.840 --> 01:03:00.249
Moderator: is there any like qualifications in particular that you're curious about.

783
01:03:07.030 --> 01:03:08.470
P12: not so much

784
01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:12.922
P12: qualifications, I think.

785
01:03:14.210 --> 01:03:15.522
P12: as far as

786
01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:17.920
P12: a secondary.

787
01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:19.330
P12: Oh.

788
01:03:19.470 --> 01:03:20.720
P12: caregiver.

789
01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:22.540
P12: I think that

790
01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:26.920
P12: you know they should have some.

791
01:03:27.350 --> 01:03:30.900
P12: you know. Does this person live close to you.

792
01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:39.050
P12: for example, like the person that I put in Sandra, she lives probably driving time. 10 or 15 min away from us.

793
01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:42.790
P12: Okay, so I don't know whether they consider.

794
01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:47.069
P12: you know, whether they would want you to have somebody that was closer.

795
01:03:47.170 --> 01:03:51.080
P12: like I could put in our neighbor, but they're not always home.

796
01:03:51.683 --> 01:03:54.990
P12: And I have another friend that lives maybe

797
01:03:55.210 --> 01:03:56.830
P12: 8 min away.

798
01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:58.909
P12: Should the person be

799
01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:02.010
P12: closer to you. I

800
01:04:02.110 --> 01:04:03.210
P12: it's just.

801
01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:05.970
P12: Or do you just put somebody that you

802
01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:08.209
P12: really you know it? You can

803
01:04:08.330 --> 01:04:11.789
P12: trust and would be there always for you.

804
01:04:13.550 --> 01:04:14.520
P12: Okay.

805
01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:15.600
Moderator: Gotcha

806
01:04:17.365 --> 01:04:19.290
Moderator: do you have any questions for me?

807
01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:22.580
Moderator: I.

808
01:04:24.270 --> 01:04:25.063
P12: I just

809
01:04:26.370 --> 01:04:28.909
P12: I don't think so. Let me just think a minute.

810
01:04:29.670 --> 01:04:30.600
Moderator: No.

811
01:04:37.010 --> 01:04:38.850
P12: When it comes to

812
01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:41.300
P12: approval

813
01:04:41.350 --> 01:04:42.045
P12: for

814
01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:47.000
P12: you know whether whichever one it is.

815
01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:48.819
P12: one or the other

816
01:04:48.930 --> 01:04:49.600
P12: something.

817
01:04:49.830 --> 01:04:54.079
P12: I think it would be good upfront, you know, when you're applying

818
01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:55.029
P12: to

819
01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:58.560
P12: Have some criteria for

820
01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:21.760
P12: you know. What do you need to be able to? What? What things do you need to meet, to be able to get the stipend one. What things do you need to meet? What qualifications do you need to meet to get the one that to, you know. Join the one that isn't a stipend, you know some

821
01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:27.820
P12: not, you know, a huge, long document or anything. But maybe

822
01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:29.309
P12: you know of

823
01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:31.839
P12: 5 bullets or

824
01:05:32.310 --> 01:05:34.000
P12: 10 bullets, and

825
01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:35.089
P12: you know what

826
01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:37.880
P12: what thing. It would just make it

827
01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:41.109
P12: easier for you to, you know. Decide which

828
01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:43.840
P12: where to start with that.

829
01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:46.629
Moderator: Okay, yeah, thank you. That's really helpful.

830
01:05:47.983 --> 01:05:56.790
Moderator: So I just wanna circle back and reconfirm, are you comfortable? If we were to share a video clip of this session with our Va partners removing any identifying information.

831
01:05:58.570 --> 01:05:59.420
Moderator: Yes.

832
01:05:59.630 --> 01:06:00.900
Moderator: Okay, great.

833
01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:10.280
Moderator: We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts. Today this feedback is going to help us improve the form. So it works really well for veterans and caregivers.

834
01:06:10.730 --> 01:06:22.919
Moderator: Lastly, Paragene will send you a thank you email that will include a blurb that you can pass along. If you know any other veterans or caregivers who may want to participate in future research studies like this.

835
01:06:23.658 --> 01:06:28.529
Moderator: I'll also have them send you that link to apply for the caregiver program.

836
01:06:28.690 --> 01:06:29.510
Moderator: Okay, I.

837
01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:34.040
P12: Truly appreciate that I really do. I'm going to just

838
01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:37.310
P12: before you go. I'm going to take a quick picture of this.

839
01:06:38.130 --> 01:06:46.840
P12: just in case. I don't get that there now. I've got the site, anyway, and I can go to that. I can type it in myself.

840
01:06:47.110 --> 01:06:47.700
Moderator: Good.

841
01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:49.969
Moderator: It's currently doesn't do that.

842
01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:51.100
P12: Okay.

843
01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:53.870
Moderator: Thank you so much. Have a great rest of your day.

844
01:06:53.870 --> 01:06:57.973
P12: Thank you, and you do the same. Thank you so much, and thank your managers, your

845
01:06:58.470 --> 01:07:03.629
P12: note takers and participants for me. I really appreciate your help with this.

846
01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:08.360
Tamara Scott: We thank you very much. We really appreciate you taking the time for this. It's very helpful.

847
01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:12.830
P12: You're very welcome. I'm glad you guys are doing this. You do a great job for them.

848
01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:14.240
P12: Thank you.

849
01:07:15.030 --> 01:07:17.136
Tamara Scott: Thank you. Have a good day. You, too.

850
01:07:17.740 --> 01:07:18.350
Moderator: Bye.

851
01:07:18.350 --> 01:07:19.090
P12: Bye-bye.
