00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:10.389
Moderator  : Okay. So I've started the recording. So just to confirm, like we chatted about, are you comfortable? If I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

2
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:11.829
P5: Yes, I am.

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.790
Moderator  : Okay?

4
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:20.979
Moderator  : And are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other Va partners or remove any identifying information.

5
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:22.499
P5: Yes, that'd be okay.

6
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:23.590
Moderator  : Okay.

7
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.470
Moderator  : thank you very much getting through that little intro piece. So now we can kind of dive right in what we were here for today.

8
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:37.890
Moderator  : So before we look at the caregiver program form online, we're going to start with a few warm-up questions about your caregiver application experience.

9
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.809
Moderator  : Have you ever applied for the program of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers before. Yeah.

10
00:00:44.288 --> 00:00:45.559
P5: No, I have not.

11
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:46.530
Moderator  : Okay.

12
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.610
Moderator  : have you heard of this program?

13
00:00:48.610 --> 00:01:05.539
P5: Yes, yes, if if it's it's money that would be dispersed, I guess, to me, because I take care of my spouse, which he was a veteran, and he's 65, gonna be 66. But it's extra money that I could use for him, and to take care of him because he has has a stroke.

14
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.680
Moderator  : Got it.

15
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.800
P5: So he's not in a nursing home. He's at home, and I know I still can qualify.

16
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.210
Moderator  : Great thanks for explaining that to us. Have you ever interacted with the Va. For family member benefits before.

17
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.661
P5: Yes, all the time, you know.

18
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.969
P5: because I speak for my husband.

19
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.800
Moderator  : Okay.

20
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.359
Moderator  : Can you tell me a little bit more in your own words, what it means to you to be a veteran caregiver?

21
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.910
P5: Oh.

22
00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:43.400
P5: as a spouse. Well, it's I don't really consider myself as a caregiver. I consider myself, I mean that's my husband, you know

23
00:01:43.726 --> 00:01:53.210
P5: but I do bring them to the doctors. I do have them around the house. Yeah, I am a caregiver. I realize it. I do what it means to me is

24
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:59.150
P5: he took care of me for all his life. So it's not like I'm just not like I'm doing it for

25
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.310
P5: any gang. I'm doing it because that's my spouse.

26
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.660
Moderator  : Thank you for sharing that.

27
00:02:06.252 --> 00:02:12.589
Moderator  : How would you like to learn about benefits like the program of comprehensive assistance of family caregivers?

28
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.040
P5: Say one more time.

29
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.000
Moderator  : How would you like to learn about benefits like the program

30
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.160
Moderator  : for comprehensive family caregivers?

31
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.540
P5: How, how would I like to learn, or how I know about the program?

32
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.060
Moderator  : How would you like to learn about it?

33
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:43.681
P5: It'd be nice because I do read all his documents either by mail or email, or possibly text text would be probably great. I can click a link and then go to it. That would probably be the best thing. Because I don't answer all the email, all the mail we get from home, you know.

34
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:54.550
P5: and I get the mail really for him to see it, too. But I would think if I would get it, I would like to have it by text stuff. Then I could click a link and go to it and read it.

35
00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.589
Moderator  : Awesome. That's great feedback. Thank you for that.

P5: What kind of medication he's on.

42
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.359

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.990
P5: What?

81
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:05.199
Moderator  : Forward, in applying.

82
00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:13.400
P5: Well before I even kind of look at it. It's just telling me what is apply for the program. You know. Family caregivers.

83
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.969
P5: that's about it. I guess if I wanted to get more information before I even click that link

84
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.169
P5: to the bottom.

85
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:27.220
P5: Okay, check check my eligibility. Okay? So I guess I can go to the bottom there

86
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:32.009
P5: and see all I need, which I kind of sort of kind of show you that we need which.

87
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:39.489
P5: and that's what. Oh, if I have questions, too, I can always call for help if I have any questions or need help. I also seen this.

88
00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:47.039
P5: I guess it's AI talk to veterans crisis line. Now, I don't know. Is that AI, or maybe that's they give me a phone number something.

89
00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.100
P5: But I could talk to him.

90
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.480
P5: If I have any questions on going through something.

91
00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:04.000
P5: And I can start my application. Tell you about how long it take you 15Â min.

92
00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:08.935

93
00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:16.600
P5: Eastern Standard time. If I have any questions concerning the application, or I guess, any questions. Period.

94
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:25.479
Moderator  : Great is there anything, if anything, on this page that stands out as being really confusing or really helpful?

95
00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:30.219
P5: I think, because I kinda know what it's about.

96
00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:46.507
P5: It's easier for me. But just say, if I didn't know about the program I don't think confusing. I mean it changed you right here, I mean, before you even fill out the application. I know before I would fill the application. I would make sure I have everything I need, so I wouldn't have to be looking for it. So

97
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.900
P5: is self explanatory, or you want to gather this

98
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:56.309
P5: first, st you need to check to see if you qualify. So if you, your spouse, 65 plus, and

99
00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.571
P5: he needs you to take care of them, whether it's a male or female.

100
00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:17.329
P5: you can click this if you don't know, and it'll tell you how you qualify. Tell you about the documents. I mean, it's self-explanatory. I mean everything. And if you need more assistance, you just click whatever it's highlighted in blue. If you have any questions.

101
00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:28.220
Moderator  : Great thanks for that feedback. So before we start, the application on a scale of one to 5, 1 being very poor and 5 being very well.

102
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:35.080
Moderator  : How prepared and informed do you feel about the application you're about to begin? Based on this page's content.

103
00:08:35.418 --> 00:08:38.800
P5: I think 5. I think I'm well informed about it.

104
00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:39.830
Moderator  : Okay.

105
00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:42.710
Moderator  : is there a reason why you would give it that rating.

106
00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:49.470
P5: I mean, because it's I well, me, I think my spouse would qualify for it.

107
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:53.320
Moderator  : Is that just?

108
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:57.939
Moderator  : Why would you say that just because of your experience previously.

109
00:08:58.378 --> 00:09:01.011
P5: Because the condition his condition?

110
00:09:03.087 --> 00:09:16.330
P5: he's at the age, I mean. If I didn't qualify, if he didn't qualify, I think something might be going on, but with all everything going on in his condition, I think he would probably qualify for that. How much I don't know. But you know.

111
00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:18.490
P5: okay.

112
00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:20.159
Moderator  : Great thanks for that feedback.

113
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:25.210
Moderator  : Okay? So now, I'd like you to start the form as if you were applying for the program.

114
00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:29.889

115
00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:34.090
P5: No, I'm not. I don't really want to put his. I'm not gonna put his name, anyway.

116
00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:40.080
Moderator  : Okay, yeah, I was gonna tell you to feel free to use fake information, and I'll prompt you with a fake social when we get there, too.

117
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:40.850
P5: Okay.

118
00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:48.709
Moderator  : And then, as you're going through it, just remember to think aloud about any reactions or thoughts.

119
00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:50.450
P5: Okay, okay.

120
00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:51.746

P5: and I'll press. Continue.

124

P5: Okay, we're not gonna put no security number. I just put 9 9 or something.

125
00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.470

134
00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:36.610
P5: Okay.

135
00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:37.580

136
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:40.549
Moderator  : yeah, just kind of think aloud. If anything seems.

P5: I mean, it's

138
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:46.399
P5: it seemed right to me, you know.

139
00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:53.090
P5: you're just filling out a regular like an application, in a sense.

140
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:07.380
P5: Oh, I don't know the address. Oh, here, gone!

141
00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:09.890
P5: Okay.

142
00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.490
P5: and I'll put the phone number in there.

143
00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:18.820
P5: I guess that'll work

144
00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:21.116
P5: and email

145
00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:37.950
P5: -Oh.

146
00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:41.140
P5: let me see.

147
00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:44.639
Moderator  : I just keep thinking aloud as you.

148
00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:46.000
Moderator  : Complete, this question.

149
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.785
P5: So it is helping me. It wanted to know where

150
00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:51.940
P5: my husband goes.

151
00:11:52.550 --> 00:12:01.219
P5: what va hospital he used to get care. I just put my zip code in the Zip code that we're in, and it located

152
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.070
P5: the closest

153
00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:07.709
P5: veteran plan or health service

154
00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:10.370
P5: that he goes to, and I just pick one of them.

155
00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:22.048
P5: you know, and and I gotta have on there so they could find, even if we go to a different. That's 1 good thing about it. Even if we go to a different city or whatever. And he needs some kind of care, I can always

156
00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:24.760
P5: It's an app we use, and you can find

157
00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:30.330
P5: what hospital he can go to. So that's a good thing. So anyway, I could continue.

158
00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:34.109
Moderator  : Yeah, is that how you prefer to search for Va facilities.

159
00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:34.920
P5: Okay.

160
00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:57.230
P5: yeah, it'd be easier. It's easy, you know, most of the time if we're going out of town. I already have it already in mind. You got to stay prepared, you know, so you know exactly. I wouldn't wait till I go out of town and say I got to find facility, no matter if we have plans of going, no matter where we go. I already have that taken care of. I know where the facility at. We try to get a hotel around that facility just in case something happened, or he needs some kind of medical care.

161
00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:03.720
Moderator  : Got it. Thank you for sharing that. Can we pause on this page? And can you talk me through what this

162
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:05.489
Moderator  : content means to you? Here?

163
00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:11.530
P5: What all is telling me is that this is a place where he get his medical attention from.

164
00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:17.609
P5: so I guess they need to have record of that in case they need to get records from that clinic or veterans clinic.

165
00:13:18.564 --> 00:13:21.469
P5: That's why they asked me that information.

166
00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:27.541
P5: and they just want me to verify. You know this information is correct.

167
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:38.499
P5: where I get my support facility where my caregiver support facility is located at. So they just want me to. They know they want to know. Is this where I go for my support that I need, or whatever.

168
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:45.090
P5: or if I need have questions or something, and then this is a place he would go to the Pork Street, BA. Clinic.

169
00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:48.629
P5: if he need to be treated, or where he gets his treatments from.

170
00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:52.849
Moderator  : Thank you for explaining that for us.

171
00:13:54.140 --> 00:14:03.259
Moderator  : So I guess, on a scale of one to 5, 1 being very poor and 5 being difficult. How would you rate this process here to choose a Va. Facility.

172
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:05.219
P5: You said, and one being what again?

173
00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:07.539
Moderator  : Very difficult, and 5 being.

174
00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:23.880
P5: 5. It's 5. I mean, it's it's using plain English. It's common sense. It's nothing hard. You just follow the directions. You know, they're not using no big words that nobody will understand like, what in the world are you talking about? I mean, everything is in plain, simple English, you know.

175
00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:31.209
P5: This is the facility where your spouse go. This is the place that you need. You need some some kind of support, or some kind of

176
00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:37.289
P5: or help fill out this application? Or, I mean, is this common? The only thing that's missing from here?

177
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:38.470
P5: Yeah.

178
00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:48.609
P5: yeah. I'm looking at like for mine at the bottom, a caregiver support facility. It has the address on there and the name, but it doesn't have a phone number in case I, you know.

179
00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:49.910
P5: Oh.

180
00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:51.240
P5: no, that's great!

181
00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:51.799
Moderator  : Thanks for that.

182
00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:55.160
P5: Okay.

183
00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:57.769
Moderator  : Okay? So yeah, you can

184
00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:01.690
Moderator  : continue on unless there's anything else you want to add.

185
00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:14.819
P5: I was looking. I was looking to see it. Now. It said, numbers right here. If you need help using this online application, call this the 4 1, 1, or the 800 number, which is 24, 7. So they open 24Â h. Okay.

186
00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.799
P5: that's good to know. But it would be nice to have a phone number right here, too.

187
00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:20.590
Moderator  : Okay, great thanks for that feedback.

188
00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:28.549
Moderator  : And as we're continuing on, what does the term primary caregiver mean?

189
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:45.150
P5: That's my husband's doctor. That's the main doctor he see for everything. Now, if his doctor tell him his primary care, doctor, tell me he needs a specialist. That's the person that will send us to a specialist. But right now his primary care giver, that's the one to see him all the time. He didn't want to make appointments like. Oh, I need him to go here. Need to go here.

190
00:15:45.708 --> 00:15:48.419
P5: I still want to give him his medication.

191
00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:50.710
Moderator  : Okay?

192
00:15:50.920 --> 00:16:01.629
Moderator  : And let's go through a scenario where you want to add a primary family caregiver on this application. So if you could go through the next few steps, and just think aloud about your thought process. That'd be great.

193
00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:07.339
P5: Okay, would you like to apply for benefits for a primary family caregiver? And that would be yes.

194
00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:12.540
P5: oh, I was reading this. I thought it'd be primary care, doctor, that's me.

195
00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:13.990
P5: Okay.

196
00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:18.820
P5: so I will pick. Yes, because I am the primary family caregiver.

197
00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:25.050
P5: I know, would be, I guess, if he would be applying for himself. I don't know, I guess

198
00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.870
P5: so I will put my name.

199
00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:33.859
P5: I use my first.st

200
00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:34.750
P5: No.

201
00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:43.980
P5: And

202
00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:45.510
P5: can I do that?

203
00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:01.800
P5: It asked you about my sexuality at birth.

204
00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:08.849
P5: primary care, relationship to the veteran. I'll be the spouse. So I click this all that is common sense. Just oh.

205
00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:20.990
P5: My name! If I want to put a middle name, I ain't putting it, it's not required. This is required for my last name. This would be a no-no. So I just guess I leave that blank.

206
00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:23.500
P5: my date of birth.

207
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:31.600
P5: Female. How am I related to relationship to the veteran? All this is just common sense for me to fill out

208
00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:34.130
P5: nothing hard to do.

209
00:17:35.223 --> 00:17:40.879
P5: I'm not quite sure why it's like they don't have nothing to say, none, you know

210
00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:46.099
P5: so, but hopefully, that don't stop me. It's not red, so I don't think it will stop me.

211
00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:47.720
Moderator  : Okay.

212
00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:48.190
P5: So.

213
00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:49.100
Moderator  : Gone through that.

214
00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:56.050
P5: So I put I'm the spouse, so I will. After looking at examine it. It goes. I fill up to the best of my ability.

215
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.710
P5: I will click. Continue.

216
00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.390
P5: Okay, when I get here.

217
00:18:03.922 --> 00:18:09.079
P5: This would be my husband, my veteran who I took care of that would be his.

218
00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:20.780
P5: Let me see primary family caregiver identification. We recommend providing the caregiver, social security or tax identification. Oh, that's mine. They won't ask questions about that now. Why do you need mine.

219
00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:36.929
P5: But we need some. Okay, he goes to answer. But we need this information in order for them to receive certain benefits like monthly payments or travel lodging financials. And when traveling with the veteran to receive care. Okay, that's why that's why I wanted. Okay, they they answer me.

220
00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:39.639
P5: So that's what they asked, Okay.

221
00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:40.730
P5: do do.

222
00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:43.929
P5: Oh, oh, they didn't say if I need space or not.

223
00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:44.970
Moderator  : 4, 4,

224
00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:46.370
Moderator  : oh.

225
00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.739
P5: I think that's how many numbers being security. Okay?

226
00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:53.780
P5: Oh, if it goes through.

227
00:18:55.360 --> 00:19:06.360
P5: That's it. Okay. If I was kind of wondering, because, you know, people are kind of funny, you know, like, when you need my security number, what you need my security number for. I'm not the person that's a veteran. It's my husband. But

228
00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:08.280
P5: so

229
00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:12.939
P5: they need your information. Because, I answered, I asked my own question. I answered.

230
00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:15.929
P5: this is why they need it, because they need to know. Let me see.

231
00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:24.229
P5: in order for them to receive certain benefits, like monthly payments or traveling logic and financial assistance traveling. It don't really tell me why they need it, though.

232
00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:30.500
P5: even if it sounds like they're gonna put it in my name instead of my husband's name, I will assume.

233
00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:33.040
P5: But it's not stated on there.

234
00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:41.089
P5: and I still kind of even though I said we need this information in order for them to receive certain benefits. It still didn't tell me why

235
00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:43.170
P5: it's like.

236
00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:45.490
P5: even though the application is for him.

237
00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:54.829
P5: In a sense, I'm kind of reply applying for it, because now they need my information so they could. I don't see how why they need my security number, though

238
00:19:55.360 --> 00:20:01.450
P5: monthly payments are travel, I mean, they're saying, because monthly payments are travel. That's not telling me why they need it. They're just saying

239
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:04.970
P5: we need you to. We need your information.

240
00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:12.829
P5: that's strange. But okay, we'll go with it. I put my social security number in Bam. There you

241
00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:16.979
P5: and I press continue, but I can always call this number and ask him.

242
00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:21.819
Moderator  : Thank you for talking through that so well, it's really helpful for us to hear.

243
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:27.809
Moderator  : Oh, it flagged it because it's sequential. So maybe change the last 2 to 3, 4.

244
00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:28.500
P5: Oh.

245
00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:32.760
P5: okay.

246
00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:41.170
P5: okay, this is very home. Use the same address as a veteran. You're talking about me. Yes, that's it. That's it.

247
00:20:41.747 --> 00:20:48.710
P5: All I had to do is click here. That's I mean, that's self-explanatory before they want to know do we live in the same house? Hold?

248
00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:51.109
P5: And of course we do, so I'll just click.

249
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:59.079
P5: click this one here, and it'll populate all everything. My address, city, state, zip code.

250
00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:08.419
P5: the county. And if I put. If I press this and say why we need this.

251
00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:16.449
P5: it helps the caregiver support team, connect caregivers with community resources that offer supported programs and services. Okay? So that's for me.

252
00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:19.746
P5: you see. So they have a support team.

253
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:41.590
P5: helps the caregiver support team connect characters with connect. So I'm not sure if they connect. They connect me with supportive program and services that could help me while taking care of my spouse is the reason why they want to account your county, because they can connect me. Apparently they'll connect with everything in my area that could help me take better care of my spouse or my veteran caregiver.

254
00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:54.159
P5: So is the primary family caregiver mailing address the same as their home address. Yes, so simple expenditure, nothing hard. They didn't use no big words. Anybody could answer these questions.

255
00:21:55.620 --> 00:22:02.010
P5: it's just common sense. It went from A to B, so after examining this here

256
00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:06.980
P5: everything is listed. Everything is okay. I'm gonna go ahead and press, continue.

257
00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:13.119
P5: And then here I'm here.

258
00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:16.339
P5: Primary family caregiver contact information

259
00:22:17.998 --> 00:22:22.181
P5: the email is optional. But it helps us contact them fast. I do like email.

260
00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:26.720
P5: We always let a caregiver a copy of our decision on the application for their records.

261
00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:31.189
P5: So of course, they're saying this year is mandatory. So I have to put my phone number.

262
00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:36.760
P5: And

263
00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:42.010
P5: if I have an extra number which I don't, I'm gonna skip that one because this is not needed. And

264
00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:56.890
P5: I put in my email because I prefer them to contact me by email. But according to this, they're going, even though they'll send me information by email, I'll still get a paper copy.

265
00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:01.620
P5: and they're able to contact me faster if I use my email. So

266
00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:16.110
P5: when this decision is made, or well about any additional information by them sending me an email saying, Well, ma'am, you're missing this, are you missing that? Or we need some more information that email will be quicker, because by the time they send it to me, even though they say they're going to send it to you by mail, too.

267
00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:21.459
P5: According to this. We always mail the carrier a copy of our decision on the application for their for their records.

268
00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:26.010
P5: They figure they're gonna tell me I ain't approve, they rather do it faster.

269
00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:27.820
P5: So

270
00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:29.000
P5: yeah.

271
00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:32.128
P5: so that's about it. So

272
00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:34.950
P5: awesome. Thank you.

273
00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:37.529
Moderator  : Talking through all that. It's very helpful to hear.

274
00:23:38.225 --> 00:23:38.920
P5: I'm

275
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:41.690
P5: okay. So the next thing I would go to

276
00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:44.950
P5: you can use the application to apply for benefit for secondary family.

277
00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:46.860
Moderator  : Yeah. Pausing. Here.

278
00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:47.460
P5: That's all.

279
00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:48.690
Moderator  : Very caregiver.

280
00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:58.099
P5: Okay, okay, okay. So in case, maybe it's 2 of us. It's me and his mom or me and his sister or me and his brother.

281
00:23:58.230 --> 00:23:59.310
P5: so

282
00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:05.269
P5: if certain things I can't do, I'll let Charles do it for me. Charles, can you say

283
00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:10.959
P5: my husband, take your brother to his doctor's office, or whatever. So sometimes he take him to the doctor's office.

284
00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:15.990
P5: so it only be right if if there was benefits that was given.

285
00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:18.280
P5: and if you take them

286
00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:32.600
P5: twice a week, and I take 3 times a week, he still he still should have an option to give him some kind of support, because taking him to a doctor, taking from to get groceries all that costs.

287
00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:35.229
P5: So that's what that is.

288
00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:46.090
Moderator  : Awesome thanks for that explanation you touched on a little bit. But how else do you think the secondary caregiver role differs from process and benefits from the primary.

289
00:24:46.951 --> 00:24:48.558
P5: Well, he's not the

290
00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:58.800
P5: the caregiver. 9, a hundred percent of the time or 90% of the time. He's only there, maybe 15% or 10%. So

291
00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:06.840
P5: And I think he probably couldn't qualify if he only that 5% or 10% are as needed. If he was bringing him to the doctor once a month.

292
00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:10.060
P5: does he still qualify as secondary family caregiver.

293
00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:14.539
P5: you know, and if I need a question answer, I can always click here.

294
00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:15.900
P5: you know.

295
00:25:17.049 --> 00:25:24.730
P5: family caregivers are approved and designed by Va as primary family caregivers, secondary caregivers to provide personal care systems, personal care services

296
00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:29.380
P5: serves as backup when I can't do it, or maybe I'm sick.

297
00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:32.930
P5: and they let you know who can. Who can be it?

298
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:40.229
P5: Anybody can. That's basically, anybody can, you know, friend, relative, neighbor.

299
00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:42.980
P5: So, yeah.

300
00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:51.029
Moderator  : Awesome thanks for talking through that. Now, I'd like you to continue like you're adding a secondary condition or secondary caregiver to this form.

301
00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:53.080
P5: So I would press continue

302
00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:57.789
P5: so. His name is Mike.

303
00:25:58.340 --> 00:25:59.340
P5: Oh.

304
00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:04.730
P5: or he's in. He's not that

305
00:26:05.615 --> 00:26:09.979
P5: I guess. Out his birthday, same as everybody else.

306
00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:12.639
P5: that's it.

307
00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:13.400
P5: Can you explain.

308
00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:17.420
Moderator  : Explain to me how you would gather some of this information if you were filling this out for real.

309
00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:28.209
P5: But I would not have that information I would have. The only thing I would have is his name and his his 1st and last name. Now, my spouse.

310
00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:40.210
P5: you could tell me, when is your brother born? What's the date and year he was born? I could put him on there, but I probably would contact him to see if he want me to add him. I'm not going to add nobody, if they don't want me to add him.

311
00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:42.480
P5: Got it.

312
00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:43.469
Moderator  : For talking through that.

313
00:26:44.780 --> 00:27:01.660
P5: so. But anyway, just say he he wanted me to add him, or maybe maybe my husband gave me his information, so they didn't ask for a social security number, either, if you look. And they didn't ask, I don't see no social security number on there. So I would have him. Okay, of course, mail and it would be his brother here.

314
00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:05.289
P5: So I'm looking. I'll look over it. Okay, that's him.

315
00:27:05.815 --> 00:27:14.800
P5: When he was born. He's a male. He's a he's a brother. Didn't ask for social security number, so I will go ahead and press. Continue.

316
00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:20.739
P5: Okay. Now he would have to give me that information.

317
00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:27.166
P5: You'll say he I call him and say, Oh, I'm putting your name down as a family caregiver.

318
00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:37.050
P5: I think they may give you some kind of reimbursement from bringing your brother to the doctors when I can't, bringing him to his apartments when I can't.

319
00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:42.700
P5: But they need your. They need your information need your Id or your social security number, you know.

320
00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:49.639
P5: So I would have to call him for that information. Just say, he said, okay, yeah, sure. Put my name down.

321
00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:55.480
Moderator  : So if you were completing this online form for real, you would coordinate

322
00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:56.870
Moderator  : getting that information.

323
00:27:56.870 --> 00:28:15.269
P5: Oh, definitely, yes, I want to 1st ask him, you know, before I can get anything. You know, I want to put you down there, because they might give you some kind of reimbursement for bringing your brother, I mean, if he happened to be at the house because he comes to his house to see his brother all the time. It just all depends. If he's at the house or swimming by the house. I want to ask you something, you know.

324
00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:17.950
P5: something like that, or I'll make you just call them.

325
00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:20.529
P5: I'll send. I'll send them a text.

326
00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:22.130
P5: you know.

327
00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:25.919
Moderator  : Would you rather sit down and complete this form together?

328
00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:28.950
Moderator  : It.

329
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:33.949
P5: Just all depend. Not really. I don't really need unless they ask me something else, you know.

330
00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:43.700
P5: But it's not really asking me too much information. I think I would need to either talk to him in person or talk to him on the phone and just ask him, you know.

331
00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:50.380
P5: you know and and let them know that now they're gonna need your social security number, because, you know, some people don't want to get a social security number.

332
00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:59.460
P5: So I would kind of, yeah, I would kind of see what he say. You know it. Would you think it okay for me to have your social security number or or whatever

333
00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:03.710
P5: you know.

334
00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:17.770
P5: and I have to let them know they're not pulling. They're not doing your credit background check, or whatever they just need this information. So if they need to, they want to send a payment to you still don't really need to know why, though.

335
00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:21.869
P5: because everyone sent a payment to him. All they really need is his name.

336
00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:23.649
P5: I don't know.

337
00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:25.140
Moderator  : Yeah.

338
00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:30.700
P5: But I cause. I know I would have to have a reason. I can just tell them that I have to have a reason why they need the social security number.

339
00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:39.979
P5: and having something like for receive certain benefits like money payment, is not telling me why they need his social security number.

340
00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:47.360
P5: So I have to find out why, exactly like they need a social security number for a payment process or something. I need something better than

341
00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:49.849
P5: for money payments, you know.

342
00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:52.039
Moderator  : Got it. Thanks for that feedback. It's really helpful.

343
00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:52.880
P5: Helpful.

344
00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:59.310
P5: Okay, well, his home is not ours, but we're gonna say it is.

345
00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:06.480
P5: So I just click that if it wasn't our home, then I wouldn't click this. I would type it in his address.

346
00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:07.940
P5: city and State

347
00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:10.509
P5: zip code. And it's just do that. Yeah.

348
00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:11.969
P5: so it won't be the same.

349
00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:18.479
Moderator  : Is that another area you need help coordinating this information? Would you need to reach out.

350
00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:23.079
P5: I would I would, because I don't know his address.

351
00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:36.550
P5: Yeah, I would need. I mean, I know exactly what he I know he's saying he's in Texas, but you know. But what else? You know

352
00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:52.009
P5: it is a secondary affirmative. Caregiver's mailing address, the same as at home. Yes.

353
00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:58.879
P5: all right. So here we go. This is his Address Street address. I assume I can just put apartment number 64 R.

354
00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:00.809
P5: In Houston, Texas.

355
00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:03.560
P5: his Zip code.

356
00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:06.240
P5: His county.

357
00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:11.219
P5: and they asked me, is the secondary family is the same as their home? Yes, it is

358
00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:15.330
P5: so. I will press continue, make sure it's nothing at the bottom.

359
00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:29.940
P5: All right. Now. They need his phone number and email. Oh, he would have to. Oh, this might be something that he might have to do in front of me, because down I didn't know how deep you're gonna go. That's down. They asked me for his phone number

360
00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:31.929
P5: and his email.

361
00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:34.460
P5: So

362
00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:43.439
P5: all right, he don't have a secondary number. And his email.

363
00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.079
P5: Oh, I missed something

364
00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:54.709
P5: 345-67-8910.

365
00:31:55.980 --> 00:32:07.779
P5: Alright. So he got. He's. I think he would have to be with me now, because they're getting a little bit deeper, or I have to keep him on phone. Stay online with Mattel, fill his application out because he might ask something else. So don't hang up, you know. That's probably what I would tell him.

366
00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:12.229
P5: So they asked me for his phone number.

367
00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:18.310
P5: the email provided calculator email address, option really helps us contact them faster. So

368
00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:22.549
P5: I assume, since they need both of us

369
00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:25.949
P5: when they make a decision, we'll get the same email.

370
00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:32.329
P5: And I'm not quite sure he'll get the email, too, or get the email only concerning if he been approved.

371
00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:40.780
P5: And I'll get the email. I think that's probably what it would be. I'll get an email saying that if I was approved and how much whatever I would be getting or whatever.

372
00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:42.509
P5: And then he'll get an email

373
00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:55.500
P5: stating how much how much, if he's awarded. If he's approved or not. I don't think he gonna get mine, and I won't get his. He'll he'll know if they approve him. I don't know if they'll approve me, but I don't think I don't think

374
00:32:56.536 --> 00:33:10.139
P5: they'll let me know if he been approved. Now, when a final letter come in because it's gonna be a letter in the email, I mean in the address, then, I think, but it probably in my spouse name. Maybe I don't know. Then they'll let us know just to

375
00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:14.590
P5: confirm that if I was approved or not.

376
00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:16.020
P5: maybe.

377
00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:20.179
P5: and they'll put and they'll put his name on there if he was approved.

378
00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:23.160
P5: But that'd be an email that's probably sent to my spouse.

379
00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:28.770
P5: But anyway, I put my his brother, his brother, naming in his information.

380
00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:35.589
P5: do you want to apply for benefits for another second year, or a 3rd person.

381
00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:40.590
Moderator  : Yeah, we don't have to add one for this form. But

382
00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:46.349
Moderator  : would you potentially see adding 2 secondary caregivers? Or what are your thoughts on that.

383
00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:55.009
P5: The only way I would add to. If I was I had a lot of appointments. I could be able to do it

384
00:33:56.620 --> 00:34:05.142
P5: and possibly if his children was around or lived with me, then I would probably add both of them, you know. But

385
00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:19.149
P5: something like this, if I. It all depends if I'm able to do it if I had like, I said, if I was sick and I had a lot of doctor's appointment too. Then I would need that second, maybe that second secondary person. But if

386
00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:32.499
P5: I'm okay and I mostly focus on him and I'll go to the doctor. Even I go to the doctor for myself, but he has more appointments than me, and I don't have a problem with bringing him, and I could drive. I don't think I would need a secondary secondary to the secondary person.

387
00:34:33.739 --> 00:34:36.349
Moderator  : Got it. Thanks for explaining that it's really helpful.

388
00:34:38.159 --> 00:34:43.109
P5: So I would click. No, I don't. We only need that. And then we go to the next one.

389
00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:45.089
Moderator  : Yeah, so let me.

390
00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:45.510
P5: Yes.

391
00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:50.130
Moderator  : Page just in your own words. Describe what this page is asking and what it means for you.

P5: I need to submit this about power attorney

410

00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:44.249
P5: they didn't ask me, though.

414
00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:51.629
P5: Okay, they only asked me this 1st to make sure that I do have the power of attorney to sign for my spouse.

415
00:36:51.690 --> 00:37:11.469
P5: That's why they asked me that. So I upload that first.st So they didn't ask me about the doctor's appointment I mean the doctor paper, or his military papers, or anything else. 1st thing before they can do anything else I need to upload my power attorney paper, or my legal guardianship paper, or another type of legal document that states I am.

00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:28.139
P5: they are not going to want nothing else. They ain't gonna come on no doctor's paper. They're not going to want nothing else until I can prove who I am.

418
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:30.150
P5: Basically, that's what it is.

419
00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:37.319
Moderator  : Got it. Thank you. That's great feedback. So to complete this, if you have

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:47.829
Moderator  : Do you have something you could upload to try.

Moderator  : One more.

436
00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:24.650
Moderator  : And now, since you don't have a document to upload, we're going to switch it to. I'm the vet.

437
00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:26.400
P5: I'm a veteran. Okay?

438
00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:28.679
Moderator  : So we can kind of bypass that.

439
00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:29.340
P5: Okay.

440
00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:33.290
Moderator  : But you had uploaded your Pdf, you said it was pretty explanatory.

441
00:38:34.074 --> 00:38:43.715
P5: So all you just reviewing this, please review is able to review these make sure, I, I got the right information maybe, I put down my, the

442
00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:59.219
P5: what are the numbers? My phone was wrong. They just want you to verify. So I probably go back just to make sure everything, because I know if I upload this and something is missing, it's gonna take a while for them, you know, to go through it and say, oh, you're missing something else, and that's couldn't delay it. That would delay it

443
00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:01.290
P5: so.

444
00:39:01.570 --> 00:39:06.789
Moderator  : Awesome. So if you did see something you entered by mistake, can you show me how you'd go about correcting that.

445
00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:09.645
P5: Well, I was like, just say, if I was

446
00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:15.470
P5: oh, I should have put my second number on there, or my job number. Then I would go here

447
00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:17.870
P5: and

448
00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:23.820
P5: see where the phone number at right here. I want to add this phone number in. So I'll just go to edit

449
00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:27.420
P5: and like, Oh, man, I should add this number here, let me go ahead and add it.

450
00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:36.340
P5: So I'm like, Okay, now, I want to edit a number, because just in case they can't get in contact with me. -Oh.

451
00:39:36.450 --> 00:39:38.130
P5: where's the number 3?

452
00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:39.659
P5: I see 7, 8, 9,

453
00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:48.130
P5: just in case they can't get in contact with me. Now they got a second number. They can call. They can call me on a second number. So, yeah, okay.

454
00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:49.760
P5: so here we go.

455
00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:59.770
P5: So okay, I this is what I wanted to add. I see it's already there. So I'm good. Now, you know. Of course I'll that's just me.

456
00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:05.439
P5: but how do I close it out?

457
00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:08.839
P5: Give me a second. Here, let me make sure.

P5: I think that's it.

461
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:35.239
P5: Then I will go to let me see application signature.

462
00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:38.240

P5: Jacksonville. I guess I don't know.

465
00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:47.660
P5: Then I click here. Everything is true. -Oh, Jack Williams, I forgot his name.

466
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:51.630
P5: Yeah, sure.

467
00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:58.560
Moderator  : Going through this last part. What's your comfort level of filling out and signing this information? If all the people weren't present.

468
00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:11.699
P5: If I was present. I mean it's fine. I mean, it didn't take long at all. I mean it was fast, and you know, when you do an application you don't want to have to be like, oh, my God, it's gonna take me an hour to finish this. You want to be able to do it and be done with it, and

469
00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:13.199
P5: go on with your life.

470
00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:26.340
P5: And I think I think that's what it is. I mean, as long as you know that information. Now, the only thing I didn't care for about was that I thought they was. Gonna ask me

471
00:41:27.141 --> 00:41:35.328
P5: like his doctor name, or or you know, other information like that. I need to upload that. But I guess they want me to.

472
00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:39.309
P5: didn't ask me on it. I don't know why, so I don't know.

473
00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:42.299
Moderator  : Yeah, Kita, you're thinking a little bit

474
00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:44.000
Moderator  : more on that topic.

475
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:56.120
P5: Yeah, because I would think, now, how do I qualify? How my spouse qualify? I need to show them some kind of proof that saying he had had a stroke. He I'm his primary care person.

476
00:41:56.953 --> 00:41:59.679
P5: I'm the person to bring him to the doctor.

477
00:42:00.324 --> 00:42:06.719
P5: Some kind of statement from his not not really statement from his doctor, but his Daca. Daca records something, you know.

478
00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:09.969
Moderator  : That's great feedback. Thank you.

479
00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:17.240
Moderator  : Okay. So if you can finish scrolling and going through this page and let me know if you have any other thoughts. We won't actually be submitting

480
00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:20.900
Moderator  : this application today. Since we're in our test environment, it won't go through.

481
00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:29.919
P5: Right. So it's just saying that of course I'm doing it for my husband. So now I'm the husband. So he saw he looking at it, reading it, reading everything.

482
00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:32.860
P5: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Hold on! Who signed this part.

483
00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:37.560
P5: Okay, so his name is here. So he signed this here

484
00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:44.780
P5: and primary family care give an applicant statement of truth. So now this is for me. I forgot my name I used so

485
00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:49.089
P5: so this one is for me.

486
00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:56.859
P5: and I put down. Okay, did I? I test that our knowledge and yep for any payment of a ham? The results in

487
00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:05.400
P5: veterans as recently participated as such as veterans is involved in my payment, related activity. I agree to perform personal care service as a family.

488
00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:08.570
P5: I mean, if you're a caregiver for the very name of this application.

489
00:43:14.110 --> 00:43:27.370
P5: saying that this participation in Pcaf does not create an employment ratio between me and the Department of Veterans Affairs. It's just for my spouse and provide some kind of financial services for me, taking care of my spouse.

490
00:43:29.070 --> 00:43:30.659
P5: That's basically what it's saying.

491
00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:40.439
P5: And of course I wanted to read more. I click this button here or take me to another website, as you probably can't see. But it's privacy, policy and legal information. So that's where I went.

492
00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:46.189
P5: So okay, all that is true. And I think and I just put my name here. I think I put down Stephanie.

497
00:43:59.050 --> 00:44:01.520

498
00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:09.380
P5: I put down the wrong. Oh, I forgot, or I missed the tapping fast. I missed putting another L in my name, you know.

500
00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:20.179

00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:47.049
Moderator  : Of the Confirmation page that we won't submit. So it's just a design prototype link.

525
00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:50.179
Moderator  : You should be able to open it in the same place.

526
00:45:50.730 --> 00:45:52.470
P5: Okay. Let me see.

527
00:45:57.850 --> 00:45:58.530
Moderator  : If you

528
00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:01.129
Moderator  : have any issues I could screen share. But.

529
00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:02.180
P5: And just tap.

530
00:46:03.250 --> 00:46:03.700
Moderator  : Awesome.

531
00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:04.480
P5: -Oh.

532
00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:08.369
P5: did I? Did you see it? Are you in here? Okay.

533
00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:11.439
Moderator  : Yep, it's loading. It looked like it just took a minute.

534
00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:12.420
P5: Okay.

535
00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:14.180
Moderator  : So, yeah, if you could

536
00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:21.260
Moderator  : walk through this page and describe to me in your own words what this page is telling you, what happened, and what will come next in the process.

537
00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:31.750
P5: Okay, so apparently I already signed up. I submitted my application in oh, my husband submitted his application for the company's assistant for family caregivers.

538
00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:34.950
P5: they let me know it went through.

539
00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:41.150
P5: They would have on here say it says your submission information. Who submitted this form?

540
00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:46.200
P5: I would have a confirmation number, which is good thing, because I can always call them up that confirmation number and

541
00:46:46.890 --> 00:47:03.249
P5: Oh, I could print the Confirmation number, so I need that to go back and like if I have questions like it's been 3 months. I haven't heard anything. My my number is confirmation number is 4, 3, 2 9. They can look it up without them trying to dig. It's easier convenient for both of us, or

542
00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:04.684
P5: I should be able to.

543
00:47:05.586 --> 00:47:08.750
P5: look online and put that number in. I don't know that'd be good, too.

544
00:47:09.690 --> 00:47:10.860
P5: So

545
00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:12.959
P5: what to expect.

546
00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:20.729
P5: All right, caregiver, support team receive care plans with the tech. The veteran and caregivers to discuss application eligibility.

547
00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:26.380
P5: So somebody will be contacting us by either email within 24Â HA good thing that'd be fast

548
00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:44.030
P5: if you didn't give us a email, we'll contact you by phone or mail which could take days. But email is quick story. So I fill this application out today I would say no more than tomorrow, maybe the next day I should have some kind of email whether I'm

549
00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:52.259
P5: either approve of my eligibility. What I approve for, or if I'm was not approved, they're gonna let me know one way or the other. I'm gonna find out.

550
00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:53.510
P5: I'll find out.

551
00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:56.129
Moderator  : Got it. Thanks for that feedback.

552
00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:03.679
Moderator  : Is there anything else on this page? Or if.

553
00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:08.650
P5: If I have questions

554
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:10.260
P5: there's a number right here.

555
00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:16.999
P5: Oh, let me know. If if your application is denied.

556
00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:20.880
P5: we'll send you a letter with the reason why we did not.

557
00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:29.290
P5: Oh, okay, I like this part. If we disagree, disagree with the decision, I can appeal or request a review of my application of the decision.

558
00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:39.940
P5: in other words, and they can find out why I needed more information. Because just saying I didn't approve is not wasn't approved is not helping me. Why I was improved, or I need somebody to look

559
00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:53.020
P5: further into this application. Review this application again, because I don't think the decision was right. So you have a I have a choice that I can get somebody to review it, appeal it, knowing that I believe I qualify for my spouse qualified for it.

560
00:48:55.070 --> 00:48:56.739
Moderator  : Great. That's really helpful. Feedback.

561
00:48:58.360 --> 00:48:58.990
Moderator  : Okay?

562
00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:00.729
Moderator  : So I've

563
00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:06.769
Moderator  : there's no other feedback you have on this screen. We just have a couple follow up questions to ask. Okay.

564
00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:07.960
P5: Okay.

565
00:49:08.070 --> 00:49:14.839
Moderator  : Okay. So if you were applying for this program for for real, what research would you do before completing a form like this?

566
00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:19.319
P5: I'll probably just go go to the same website I was on, and just just reading about it

567
00:49:19.881 --> 00:49:23.768
P5: reading, getting more information. Same website, I went on,

568
00:49:25.410 --> 00:49:32.430
P5: not the caregiver decision reviews or appeals. But when I 1st got there 1st website, I think it was this one here, let me see

569
00:49:32.550 --> 00:49:41.975
P5: the 1st one, did you? That went to? You know? It tells me about the program, you know. I want to know what is this program, you know. So maybe

570
00:49:43.350 --> 00:49:45.230
P5: let me see a flower program.

571
00:49:45.647 --> 00:50:03.192
P5: Probably this here apply for program accompany's assistance for family caregiver. I probably go here because once I click here, then it would take me to the website. That's saying what this program is, what it's about. Just like I was saying, it was saying, you have to have this. You gotta be 65 older, or some kind of disability.

572
00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:12.819
P5: And who could apply for you? Are you applying for yourself, or is somebody power attorney over you? That's doing it. So let me know. And

573
00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:13.960
P5: if

574
00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:24.020
P5: I qualify, you have questions on that, what it takes to qualify. So I will read that first.st I want to make sure I my husband's qualified. I qualify for this program. He qualified for it.

575
00:50:24.050 --> 00:50:29.050
P5: and what it takes to qualify and what all information that you need to qualify for the program

576
00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:33.340
P5: before I even apply, I'm not gonna apply for nothing. I don't think I'm gonna get.

577
00:50:35.070 --> 00:50:43.180
Moderator  : Thank you for that feedback. So what are your thoughts on the amount of information provided within the form? Do you think it was too much just enough.

578
00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:54.144
P5: No one thing. One thing they don't tell you is what you qualify for. They'll even give you a a run about money, you know they don't let you know.

579
00:50:55.230 --> 00:51:16.759
P5: you can get up to X amount. I don't see that I mean, I don't see. I mean, if they saying I get $5 each time I bring my husband, I mean, sometimes it's not just worth it. I'm giving you my security number. I give you all my information. That is, it'll be very disappointing when you give all the information. You didn't give your information. You gave your brother-in-law information, and you still don't qualify, you know.

580
00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:25.539
P5: so I would read all about to see what are my chances on on getting approved or my spouse getting approved for this

581
00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:27.020
P5: program

582
00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:39.819
P5: before I even put down, take away from my time to fill out an application that I probably not qualify for. Is it based on my income or based on my spouse income, you know. I didn't see that either.

583
00:51:41.950 --> 00:51:47.580
Moderator  : Great that's really helpful feedback. Is there anything else that you would like to add

584
00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:52.820
Moderator  : about kind of the information, or how who qualifies for a primary or secondary caregiver.

585
00:51:53.061 --> 00:51:58.128
P5: I just was very curious about I just need to know, 1st of all, why they need my security number.

586
00:51:58.904 --> 00:52:03.025
P5: I need my brother's security number, and I like to see

587
00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:11.060
P5: what are the chances? Is it based on the amount based on my income or my spouse income or combined income.

588
00:52:11.770 --> 00:52:20.679
P5: or it just didn't don't matter. So I'm just curious, you know who I'm not gonna apply for a program that I know is only going. I'm gonna get $20 a month.

589
00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:34.269
P5: you know. I gave you all my information so it'd be good to know, like how much they can give me a round about figure we we give between $50. Is it monthly? It? Would it be month? I assume it'd be monthly, you know.

590
00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:41.229
P5: I don't know. Is it because it didn't tell me it doesn't have anywhere? Maybe if I would dig a little bit more, maybe I could find out, you know.

591
00:52:41.290 --> 00:52:51.219
P5: Would it be a monthly basis, or each time I bring my spouse to to go to the doctor, where we have to go out of town or we go. We have to stay at a hotel.

592
00:52:53.280 --> 00:53:03.569
P5: Do I pay for it upfront, and then send it. Send that receipt whatever back to them, or to whoever, and I get reimbursed for that. So that's that. I don't know.

593
00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:07.420
Moderator  : Got it. That's really helpful. Feedback. Thank you for explaining that.

594
00:53:07.810 --> 00:53:18.099
Moderator  : Okay, well, that is all we have today. So I just wanna circle back and reconfirm. Are you comfortable if we decide to share a short video clip with our Va partners.

595
00:53:18.100 --> 00:53:20.310
P5: Yes, I'm very comfortable. Thank you. Okay.

596
00:53:20.310 --> 00:53:36.670
Moderator  : And yeah, we'll remove any identifying information just to reiterate that. So yeah, that's it. We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today, and your feedback is really helpful as we continue to iterate the site and hope it works better for veterans and caregivers, too.

597
00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:39.299
P5: Alright. Well, thank you so much. You have a great day bye, bye.

598
00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:44.660
Moderator  : Perry. Jean will be sending you a thank you. Note with a little blurb. You can pass along to anyone else. So thank you again.

P5: Alright! Alright, thank you. Have a great day bye, bye.
