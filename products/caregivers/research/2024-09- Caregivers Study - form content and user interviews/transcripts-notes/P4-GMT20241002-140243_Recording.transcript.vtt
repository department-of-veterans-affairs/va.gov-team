Moderator: Must be an animal.

67
00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:37.079

68
00:04:37.825 --> 00:04:40.620
Moderator: So I will grab that link.

69
00:04:43.716 --> 00:04:48.079
Moderator: I know you're on your phone. It's a little harder to find the chat on there. So

70
00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.699
Moderator: if you can look for the chat in Zoom, I've posted the link in there.

71
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:05.269
P4: I don't know why your screen is always so small. Mine is full screen. I don't know. It is 1st time.

P4: No, you have to.

73
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:15.619
Moderator: It might be. When you tap the the screen on zoom, you'll see like a menu bar pop up, I think, on the bottom.

74
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.300
P4: I

75
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.930

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:14.020
Moderator: then, I'm curious what your thoughts were about this facility, selection step, and why you chose the facility that you did.

315
00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:19.730
P4: Because is

316
00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:22.849
P4: cross, and I

317
00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:25.000
P4: serial

318
00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:27.369
P4: so I can answer no.

319
00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:33.919
Moderator: Is that the one that you use right now.

320
00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:35.630
P4: Yes.

321
00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:41.959
Moderator: Okay, good to know. What would you do if you wanted to change that facility to a different one?

322
00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:47.760
P4: I not think so.

323
00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:53.360
P4: because this is the one closer

324
00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:57.019
P4: and easier to go.

325
00:26:58.040 --> 00:26:58.890
Moderator: Gotcha.

326
00:26:59.260 --> 00:26:59.850
P4: Okay.

327
00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:04.549
Moderator: I just want to see what you would do if you needed to edit that

328
00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:08.620
Moderator: and pick a different facility, not for real.

329
00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:10.130
P4: Oh, okay.

330
00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:12.329
P4: I think I might.

331
00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:16.329
P4: What I have to do I don't know.

332
00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:18.270
Moderator: That's okay.

333
00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:22.389
P4: What's the problem? No.

334
00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:27.189
P4: he tried to heal.

335
00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:34.290
Moderator: No, that's okay. If if it's not clear to you how to do that, then that's perfectly good feedback.

336
00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:35.730
P4: Yes.

337
00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:36.900
Moderator: Okay.

338
00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:39.509
Moderator: you can keep going. Then.

339
00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:41.100
P4: Okay.

340
00:27:43.185 --> 00:27:50.689
Moderator: How would you rate that facility selection? Step one to 5, 1 being bad, 5 being the best.

341
00:27:51.325 --> 00:27:54.120
Moderator: Just how easy was that process.

342
00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:58.769
P4: Easy, I think, for

343
00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:07.019
P4: because something you have to think a lot what you're gonna put it in.

344
00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:10.950
P4: So I think for.

345
00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:13.890
Moderator: Okay, think about what a lot.

346
00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:21.409
P4: It's mean, like, you are something information, something. You are

347
00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:28.840
P4: like your bird, your phone, your anything, something like that

348
00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:39.980
P4: sometimes do not want to share with someone or something you not want to share is maybe keep. You think a lot for that. So I I think

349
00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:41.840
P4: that that one.

350
00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:49.270
Moderator: Okay, what about just selecting the facility like just that step that we just did?

351
00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:56.720
Moderator: Did you find that difficult to do? Easy to do could use some improvement.

352
00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:05.919
Moderator: You can go back a step if you want to refresh your memory.

353
00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:12.710
P4: When I look this.

354
00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:29.039
Moderator: What does the term primary caregiver mean to you?

355
00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:34.229
P4: Is mean the one who

356
00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.940
P4: 100%

357
00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:39.270
P4: to heal veteran or

358
00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:40.889
P4: to do anything.

359
00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:43.410
P4: Thank you.

360
00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:44.400
Moderator: You said.

361
00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:46.759
P4: Yeah, I think 100%.

362
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:50.000
P4: And maybe you have secondary to help you.

363
00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:52.840
Moderator: Okay.

364
00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:59.349
Moderator: So let's go through a scenario where you want to add a primary caregiver on this application.

365
00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:04.520
Moderator: Just go through the next few pages and trying to add that and think aloud about your thought process.

366
00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:15.360
P4: With the.

367
00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:19.310
P4: and adding to here.

Moderator: Can you hear me? Okay.

00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:28.240
P4: Yay!

370
00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:32.530
Moderator: Okay, can you keep going with the form and add a primary caregiver.

371
00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:33.450
P4: Yes.

372
00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:37.640
P4: you're doing this like you didn't do before

373
00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:39.110
P4: 1st time.

374
00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:42.800
Moderator: Well, it's been years. So that's understandable.

375
00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:55.799
P4: Why they come with the same. Okay.

376
00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:59.550

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:24.060
P4: joining my meeting.

378
00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:27.570
P4: Gosh.

379
00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:52.100
P4: okay.

380
00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:58.850
Moderator: Let me know any thoughts you're having as you're going through.

381
00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:25.209
P4: And now they come to. I have to put social security number again.

382
00:32:28.410 --> 00:32:32.279
Moderator: You can put a fake one, but I'm interested to hear any thoughts that you have.

383
00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:33.140
P4: Click.

384
00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:36.120
P4: violate, violate.

385
00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:49.660
P4: Don't

386
00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:59.690
P4: okay, bye.

387
00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:14.050
P4: Yes.

388
00:33:14.150 --> 00:33:15.840
P4: continue.

389
00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:26.870
P4: Hmm.

390
00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:23.580
Moderator: Okay? And what does a secondary caregiver mean to you?

391
00:34:24.609 --> 00:34:29.899
P4: It means someone can support primary caregiver

392
00:34:30.179 --> 00:34:33.339
P4: when family caregiver is

393
00:34:34.579 --> 00:34:38.109
P4: futile or sick, or

394
00:34:40.409 --> 00:34:43.079
P4: or try it, want to take a break.

395
00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:44.340
Moderator: Okay?

396
00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:52.729
Moderator: And how do you think that the secondary caregiver role differs in the application process and the benefits from the primary caregiver.

397
00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:59.530
P4: Have to go through the same thing, the same tax. Everything

398
00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:04.000
P4: I I think secondary have to be.

399
00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:08.579
P4: The most thing is the same is have to

400
00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:13.400
P4: test complete anything. I

401
00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:21.840
P4: I I

402
00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:24.319
P4: I have to click it also.

403
00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:30.279
Moderator: Yeah, let's go through as though you are adding a a secondary caregiver.

404
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:31.820
P4: Okay.

405
00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:33.490
P4: yes.

406
00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:01.120
P4: The naming.

407
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.900
P4: Okay.

408
00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:06.580
P4: yeah.

409
00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:07.745
P4: Okay.

410
00:37:17.410 --> 00:37:19.620
P4: Okay. Same same

411
00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:30.350
P4: phone number.

412
00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:28.850
Moderator: Okay, so I'm curious. If you were completing this form for real how would you go about coordinating, getting all of that information from everyone involved.

413
00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:36.780
P4: Is mean.

414
00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:38.600
P4: Explain again.

415
00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:53.900
Moderator: Sure. So you just entered the veterans information and the primary caregiver and the secondary caregiver. And I know we're putting in fake information for this test. But if you had to really get all of that information for real

416
00:38:54.438 --> 00:38:57.510
Moderator: how would you have to coordinate that.

417
00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:02.609
P4: That me

418
00:39:10.930 --> 00:39:12.450
P4: it mean

419
00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:15.240
P4: what I gonna say.

420
00:39:17.570 --> 00:39:18.849
Moderator: How would you get

421
00:39:18.930 --> 00:39:28.939
Moderator: that secondary caregivers, email, social security number, address all of that information as well as the primary caregiver and the veteran.

422
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:38.970
P4: So it mean they have to be closer to us or live with us. Or I have a trust 100%. So I can

423
00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:41.279
P4: are gonna get from that.

424
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:44.280
P4: Not someone outside our family.

425
00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:45.510
Moderator: Yeah.

426
00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:55.389
Moderator: So is that all information that you would know yourself? Would you need to contact them? Would you want them to be here with you in person to complete the form.

427
00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:59.429
P4: I wanted to be here

428
00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:01.020
P4: with me.

429
00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:02.250
Moderator: In person.

430
00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:03.190
P4: Yes.

431
00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:14.550
Moderator: Alright. Let's say no to this question that's asking if you want to add another secondary caregiver.

432
00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:15.730
P4: No.

433
00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:17.270
Moderator: And keep going.

434
00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:25.370
Moderator: Okay. So on this page, I'd like you to tell me in your own words what you think. It's asking you.

P4: something for veteran?

439
00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:05.920
P4: Oh.

440
00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:08.690
P4: he can do himself.

441
00:41:09.370 --> 00:41:10.090
Moderator: Okay.

Moderator: And are you a legal representative for the veteran.

443

Moderator: Okay? And then what would you expect to happen next?

448
00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:46.549
P4: I'm not sure. I think we're gonna say.

449

Moderator: Sign.

Moderator: but it's going to ask you to match the name that you put in, so it will.

553
00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:16.550
Moderator: You'll have to put the same name that you put for the veteran.
