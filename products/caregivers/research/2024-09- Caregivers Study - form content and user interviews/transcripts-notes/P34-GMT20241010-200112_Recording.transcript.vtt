00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:08.810
Moderator: Okay. So I've started the recording. And I just like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

2
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.050
P34: Yes, I am.

3
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.110
Moderator: Okay?

4
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:18.539
Moderator: And if you're comfortable, we just start to use a recorded clip. From our discussion with any identifiable information removed and blurred out.

5
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:19.610
P34: Yes.

6
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:20.800
Moderator: Okay.

7
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.469
Moderator: well, that is our intro. So thank you for hanging with me through that. So

8
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.609
Moderator: before we look at the caregiver online form, we have a couple of warm-up questions for you.

9
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:30.250
P34: Okay.

10
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.060
Moderator: Have you applied for the program of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers?

11
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.320
P34: Well, I don't think I have.

12
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.350
P34: Oh, I mean

13
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.129
P34: I am a caregiver. Is that? That's not what you're asking, though.

14
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.950
Moderator: Yeah, I guess. Are you enrolled in the program?

15
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.830
P34: As a caregiver.

16
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:50.460
Moderator: Okay.

17
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.719
P34: Yes, I am.

18
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.010
Moderator: Okay.

19
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.519
Moderator: And so, how many months ago did you enroll.

20
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.769
P34: Oh, I've been in probably 2 years now.

21
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.370
Moderator: Okay?

22
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.859
Moderator: And I said, if you could explain the caregiver program to somebody who's interested in enrolling, how would you explain it?

23
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.271
P34: Hmm! Never thought about it.

24
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:29.030
P34: if you're already taking care of somebody, it's a benefit to you to enroll in the program because you do get paid for helping the person that you've been helping, and there is support. If you want the support

25
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.359
P34: or extra help.

26
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.020
Moderator: Awesome. Great thanks for explaining that.

27
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.230
Moderator: And are you familiar with the concept of a primary or secondary caregiver?

28
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:40.300
P34: Yes.

29
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.679
Moderator: Okay. Do you know which one you are enrolled as.

30
00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.379
P34: Okay. Now, are you asking for my vet or for me?

31
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.360
Moderator: You? Are you enrolled as the primary or the secondary caregiver.

32
00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:13.670
P34: Okay. Oh, caregiver, I was thinking, primary doctor. Sorry I'm so used to working everything for my husband that I do think that away. Yes, yes, I'm the primary one, and no, we do not have a secondary one, because we didn't figure we needed one. At this point my children would be available so.

33
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:24.509
Moderator: Got it cool. Thanks for sharing that. And when you completed the caregiver form online a couple of years ago, remember, go back. Did you do it in person, at a facility or online.

34
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.450
P34: Online.

35
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.169
Moderator: Okay? And what did you do in preparation for completing the online form.

36
00:02:31.643 --> 00:02:43.680
P34: I did the research on the vagov.gov to see what was available and what I needed to know and what was out there. I do a lot of research most of the time.

37
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.160
P34: so I was comfortable.

38
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:47.210
Moderator: Okay.

39
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:55.959
Moderator: yeah, thanks for explaining that. And so I'm guessing. Did you complete all the Va forms on your own? Or did an accredited representative representative? Or Vso.

40
00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.800
P34: I always do it on my own.

41
00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.750
Moderator: Okay.

42
00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.639
Moderator: And I guess, is there anything else you'd like to share about your experience with the caregiver, application.

43
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.560
Moderator: form and program? So far, either good or bad.

44
00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.199
P34: The caregiver program.

45
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.100
P34: I do get frustrated

46
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:28.240
P34: that we have to have the wellness check, I guess. But that's for my husband. I mean, it just seems like it goes over the same thing, and he gets tired of listening, answering it. So.

47
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.419
P34: But that's just part of the program.

48
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.829
Moderator: Thanks for sharing that.

49
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:40.030
Moderator: Okay? Well, thank you for going over that background questions. Now, we're gonna change gears a bit. I'm going to

50
00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.870
Moderator: give you a link in the chat for zoom here, and if you could open that link

51
00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.070
Moderator: and then open it in a browser, and I don't know if you want to close anything on your computer.

52
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:57.170
Moderator: prepare for it. But once you have that link open and you're ready to share, let me know if you need any help.

53
00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.240
P34: Okay, whoops

54
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:02.510
P34: it will.

55
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:15.689
P34: I lost it. When I went with my cursor onto it, it went away. What if I just hit the share screen on the bottom of my screen or the bottom of the screen that you're on. Will that do it?

56
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.819
Moderator: Yep, and then you'll need to just share the link or tab that I

57
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:24.249
Moderator: put in chat. So if you could open that and just share that one screen. That would be great.

58
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.240
P34: Okay.

59
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.480
P34: okay, it says, I'm screen sharing. Now. Do you see it?

60
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:46.039
Moderator: Yep, I see everything. Just so, you're aware. And then in zoom chat there was a link.

61
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.719
Moderator: and I don't see your zoom up.

62
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.609
P34: When I put my cursor on it, it left.

63
00:04:53.390 --> 00:05:00.670
Moderator: Okay, can you? Maybe during the bottom bar there's that little Zm circle. If you click on that, does it bring it back up.

64
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:07.529
P34: Oh, mine's up at the top. Let's see, the chat. Is that the one you want me to do?

65
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.359
Moderator: Should be a link in that chat.

66
00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.360
P34: It's saying.

67
00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:19.560
P34: There we go.

68
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.190
P34: Okay. Now I'm gonna hit the link.

69
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.829
P34: And there I am. Apply for the program. Okay.

70
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:40.979
Moderator: Awesome. Yeah, that's where we need to be. Okay. So can you please review this page and tell me your initial thoughts and expectations of this form before going forward and applying.

71
00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:11.200
P34: Okay, I'm fine with all that, and it looks good. It's

72
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:12.880
P34: self-explanatory.

73
00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:14.200
Moderator: Okay.

74
00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.529
Moderator: what if anything stands out as being confusing or really helpful?

75
00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:28.299
P34: Well, the check your eligibility, because I think that's a problem for a lot of people. They always wonder

76
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:33.570
P34: how to find out if they're eligible. So I guess that will tell you. And

77
00:06:38.376 --> 00:06:41.310
P34: the gather, your information ahead of time is helpful.

78
00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.520
P34: and I like the fact that's got the support line.

79
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:54.089
P34: No, everything looks good. I don't. Yeah. It just looks normal for everything I've ever used.

80
00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:55.870
Moderator: Okay.

81
00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:08.120
Moderator: on a scale of one to 5, 1 being very poorly and 5 being very well. How prepared and informed do you feel about the application you're about to begin. Based on this page's content.

82
00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:13.740
P34: 5, because I'm familiar with it. I don't know about someone else. But yes, for me. 5

83
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:15.100
P34: got it.

84
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:20.279
Moderator: Okay. Now, I'd like you to start this form as if you were applying for the program.

85
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:21.330
P34: Okay.

86
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:33.850
Moderator: Okay, so this is our testing site. Your information won't go any well anywhere, but feel free to use real or fake information, whichever one you're more comfortable with.

87
00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.179
Moderator: I can give you a fake one to enter in here. It'll throw on the sequential.

88
00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:06.880
P34: Work.

89
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:08.190
Moderator: Yeah, just do.

90
00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:12.658
Moderator: Oh, you mixed it up. Yeah, that should work under like 4, 5, 6, 7.

91
00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:20.939
Moderator: If you were doing this for real. Would you have that memorized, or would you need to look? Look it up.

92
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:22.480
P34: I gave a fake one.

93
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.379
P34: No, and I would. I have it memorized. So not a problem. Okay.

94
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:28.150
Moderator: Okay.

95
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:55.860
Moderator: And if you can go through this, if you just remember to think aloud, we just want to know if any reactions or thoughts you're having as you're going through the fields.

96
00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:58.129
P34: Oh, okay.

97
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:01.160
P34: pretty standard.

98
00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:30.639
P34: And normally, I would put in an email address. So you want me to do what I normally would do.

99
00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:37.090
Moderator: Yeah. Yeah. And you can use fake information if you don't want to use your real stuff. But what you'd normally do.

100
00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:37.630
P34: Yeah.

101
00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.100
Moderator: How would you like to prefer.

102
00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:00.370
P34: So.

103
00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:02.900
Moderator: Or how would you like to search for Va. Facilities.

104
00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:11.050
P34: Yeah. So I probably need to search for real. Is that what they're asking on that one? It didn't accept my goof or my.

105
00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.449
Moderator: Was he trying to do like a fake postal code.

106
00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.100
P34: Fake. One didn't work.

107
00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:23.119
Moderator: Yup. It has to be for real. To get it to work is the Zip code. How you would prefer to search for facilities.

108
00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:26.730
P34: Probably not.

109
00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.010
P34: I would probably use

110
00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:30.950
P34: Colorado Springs.

111
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:43.800
Moderator: And

112
00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:47.410
Moderator: if you wanted to change your facility that you selected.

113
00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:49.950
Moderator: can you walk me through? How you would accomplish that.

114
00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.140
P34: If I had wanted to. There.

115
00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:58.800
Moderator: If you wanted to change the facility you selected.

116
00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:02.410
P34: I would go back with the back button and change it.

117
00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:06.250
P34: Is that what you're asking me? Yep, okay.

118
00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:09.629
P34: So now I need to fill this back in.

119
00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:15.820
Moderator: Yeah. Is that what you'd expect to happen there? What are your thoughts on that process?

120
00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:21.059
P34: Yes, because of the fact that it gave me the options.

121
00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:27.970
P34: because one of these is actually where he gets his doctor's appointments, where the other one is the main clinic.

122
00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:29.800
P34: So yeah.

123
00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:42.310
P34: I actually didn't realize

124
00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:46.430
P34: there were that other the other 2 clinics there.

125
00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:49.369
P34: or 3 clinics.

126
00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.410
P34: Okay.

127
00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:59.770
Moderator: Yeah, if you just talk me through this page. And what are your thoughts and impressions here.

128
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.870
P34: Okay. That I chose my clinic, and I can see that the support facility

129
00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:11.109
P34: is Aurora. And now I'm wondering

130
00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:16.780
P34: if I would have went back and changed it, would it have changed Aurora.

131
00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:20.530
P34: which I guess it wouldn't, because it's a regional one. So

132
00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.640
P34: because sometimes I get frustrated that it is in an aurora.

133
00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:31.389
P34: because the other problem, I think, is so much of the Va stuff is going

134
00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:40.069
P34: national. It looks like, and therefore I call for something, and the help is way away from here and have no clue. What's

135
00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.189
P34: even there, even what our weather's doing so.

136
00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:46.030
P34: But.

137
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:46.410
Moderator: Expert.

138
00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:47.060
P34: Okay.

139
00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:49.399
P34: So I would continue.

140
00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:55.080
Moderator: Yeah. And before we continue on, I also have another rating question for you

141
00:12:55.150 --> 00:13:01.020
Moderator: on a scale of one to 5 of one being very poor, and 5 being really easy to do.

142
00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:06.309
Moderator: how would you rate the overall process of the Va. Facility selection pages.

143
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:07.210
P34: 5.

144
00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:09.770
Moderator: Okay. And why would you give it that.

145
00:13:11.221 --> 00:13:16.940
P34: Because it did give me multiple choices so that it was easy to to find which one I wanted.

146
00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:19.310
P34: Okay, great.

147
00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:21.789
Moderator: Thanks for that feedback. You can continue on.

148
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:26.859
P34: Do you want me to wait before I hit the continue button? I'm 1 of these people that go

149
00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:32.520
P34: too fast. Probably so would it be better for you to tell me every time to continue?

150
00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:33.620
P34: No.

151
00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:39.499
Moderator: I think those are the couple of pauses that I was trying to sneak in. So I think we're good.

152
00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:40.410
P34: Okay.

153
00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:42.350
P34: okay, so,

154
00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.640
Moderator: Yeah, as we're doing this, what does a primary caregiver mean to you?

155
00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:53.250
P34: It's the one that is

156
00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.949
P34: gets paid through the Va. Basically more than anything.

157
00:13:58.500 --> 00:13:59.099
Moderator: Got it.

158
00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:07.220
Moderator: Yeah, continue on and then fill it out like you normally would. Again, same rules apply. If you don't want to use real go use, fake info.

159
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:31.550
P34: Okay, I'm very comfortable with all that. It was self explanatory. Oh, there's more, though, isn't there? Okay.

160
00:14:32.676 --> 00:14:34.509
P34: no, okay.

161
00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:19.909
P34: And is it gonna kick it out, because I don't remember what fake number I gave

162
00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:22.460
P34: while ago.

163
00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:27.189
Moderator: Oh, if it's the same number that used for the veteran, yeah.

164
00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.180
Moderator: maybe we can pick a different one or adjust it by a number.

165
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.119
Moderator: Would that be a concern if you were doing it for real.

166
00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:41.570
P34: No cause. I would have definitely used everything right, one

167
00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:43.409
P34: that I use all the time.

168
00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:52.719
Moderator: I know you mentioned. You don't have a secondary caregiver. But what does a secondary caregiver mean to you in this within this program?

169
00:15:53.964 --> 00:15:59.359
P34: Someone that would take over if I was unable to be the caregiver

170
00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:05.609
P34: or someone that's yes, and somebody that's online already signed up

171
00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.310
P34: in case I couldn't.

172
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:09.240
P34: So

173
00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:14.250
P34: do you want me to go ahead with it or not? Because I would have no normally said no.

174
00:16:16.005 --> 00:16:22.879
Moderator: Yeah, we'll answer it as you normally do. But I just have one more question, how do you think the secondary role differs in the process and benefits

175
00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:24.859
Moderator: between the primary.

176
00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:39.199
P34: Well, the secondary doesn't get the benefits, and it doesn't get paid, doesn't get the

177
00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:42.630
P34: I will.

178
00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:49.469
P34: And if they didn't have health benefits they probably wouldn't be able to get health benefits through this.

179
00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.960
P34: So

180
00:16:56.220 --> 00:17:01.690
P34: yeah, I don't remember. I remember looking all that up and deciding it wasn't worth going through.

181
00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.220
Moderator: Got it. Thanks for talking through that a little bit more.

182
00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:12.359
Moderator: So I guess if you were completing this online form for real coordinating information would really just be

183
00:17:12.579 --> 00:17:14.780
Moderator: you and your husband, the veteran.

184
00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:15.910
P34: That's true.

185
00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:19.530
Moderator: Would you still sit down and complete the form together.

186
00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.040
Moderator: or would you just

187
00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:21.740
Moderator: handle it.

188
00:17:22.055 --> 00:17:25.209
P34: Most of it. I handle all on my own. Okay.

189
00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.919
P34: but I see that. You know, I could look at this and see.

190
00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:30.700
P34: let's see.

191
00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:36.930
P34: Yeah, okay, so that wasn't anything different than what I thought I remembered.

192
00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:39.830
P34: Okay.

193
00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:41.010
P34: thanks.

194
00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:44.379
Moderator: Would you ever have an interest of adding a secondary family? Caregiver?

195
00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:46.880
Moderator: Now, like, after you've applied.

196
00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:47.690
P34: Oh.

197
00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:56.960
P34: probably not, because 2 of my kids are

198
00:17:57.610 --> 00:17:58.670
P34: close by.

199
00:17:59.538 --> 00:18:06.171
P34: So if I needed him I'd holler at him, or if my husband needed him, he'd holler at him. Call him not holler.

200
00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:08.400
P34: Okay.

201
00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:12.420
Moderator: Got it. Thanks for talk to that you can continue on.

202
00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:19.650
Moderator: and that in your own words on this page. Just describe what it's asking and what it means to you.

203
00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:25.209
P34: Okay, I'm gonna review it. I'm going to sign it.

204
00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:33.500
P34: and the veteran will sign for me. I mean, sign that he wants me.

205
00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:38.110
Moderator: There's are you a legal representative.

206
00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:38.520
P34: Yes.

207
00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:39.799
Moderator: The okay.

208
00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:51.339
Moderator: Just kind of talk through in your own words what you see on this page and what you'd expect to happen next.

209
00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:54.460
P34: Let's see

210
00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.149
P34: just a minute. Let me see what they're.

211
00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:30.449
Moderator: Is there anything here you'd want more clarification on.

212
00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:34.379
P34: No, I'm trying to think what I would have used, though.

213
00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:43.819
P34: because I'm in the system as being able to act on his behalf.

214
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:50.409
P34: But the legal system that I or the legal document I have is

215
00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:54.680
P34: power

216
00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:56.410
P34: of

217
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:58.190
P34: medical.

218
00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:17.460
P34: So I would be. I would have been a little bit okay. What am I needing to do here? If I were signing the documents because now I would have figured I was gonna sign all the documents so be anything that needed signed.

219
00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:22.250
P34: When I applied I did not, and my husband did sign

220
00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:27.109
P34: And now I'm wondering if I should

221
00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:28.290
P34: cover

222
00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.960
P34: power of attorney on everything.

223
00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:41.109
Moderator: Is there anything else on this page that could kind of help guide you

224
00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:43.609
Moderator: through that decision that you would like to see.

225
00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:53.359
P34: See, I would have said I'm the veteran signing for myself.

226
00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:54.830
P34: which isn't

227
00:20:56.460 --> 00:21:00.339
P34: true, although he would have signed if I printed it and signed it.

228
00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:04.509
P34: it should probably. Well, this is for a caregiver.

229
00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:13.470
P34: Yeah, I'm thinking, dual thing. I'm thinking I'm already a caregiver. I'm already in the system. I do all of it.

230
00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:18.830
Moderator: Yeah, kind of thinking back, how would you want this to work if you were signed.

231
00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:19.469
P34: I am for the first.st

232
00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:19.890
Moderator: To add.

233
00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:20.660
P34: Ted.

234
00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:33.959
P34: I guess I would have just used the I'm the veteran signing for myself because he should be able to choose

235
00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:39.209
P34: and sign for himself, for his caregiver. So I

236
00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:41.249
P34: don't really have a problem with that.

237
00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:52.929
P34: But I was just, I guess I'm thinking forward when I'm now looking at this thinking? Okay? Maybe at some point I better have a valid power of attorney

238
00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:55.330
P34: for everything.

239
00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:09.249
P34: because everything normally we are on all documents together, whether it's the mortgage or the bank accounts, or any of that, so I can automatically handle everything

240
00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:14.340
P34: but something like this with the Va. I would not have been. I wouldn't have had

241
00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:16.479
P34: the right form

242
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:19.120
P34: to

243
00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:27.729
P34: unless it's this the form here. And I would have looked that up the alternate signer certificate.

244
00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:37.490
P34: because I think that is what is in the Va. For myself now, so that anybody and everybody can talk directly to me, and it doesn't have to be

245
00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:39.530
P34: for my husband.

246
00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:44.970
P34: I'm assuming I probably signed that. So do you want me to look that up right quick, like I normally would.

247
00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:47.619
Moderator: Yeah, if that's what you would do.

248
00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:48.130
P34: Okay.

249
00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:50.050
Moderator: For a normal process. Go ahead and.

250
00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:50.830
P34: Okay.

251
00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:52.200
P34: Oh.

252
00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:59.060
P34: except I've got an issue now, cause I didn't. Just a minute. Let me.

253
00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:04.639
Moderator: So would you normally just

254
00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:06.049
Moderator: kind of go to the search bar.

255
00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:10.119
P34: Yeah, I would. Yeah. And I. But I'm almost.

256
00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:14.880
P34: It looks like I covered up something that I probably shouldn't have. So I'm yeah.

257
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:20.530
P34: because the little bar comes down and I can't move my

258
00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:24.010
P34: window, because I would have opened another window.

259
00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:27.020
P34: So would you like for me to do that or not, do that.

260
00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:30.309
Moderator: No, we can just kind of talk through it. So I guess you're.

261
00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:30.770
P34: I just want to.

262
00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:34.620
Moderator: Of what you search, and then what would you expect to happen next?

263
00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:40.780
P34: I would have just put in Va form 2122, and it would have came up

264
00:23:41.171 --> 00:23:48.239
P34: and I would have looked at it to see if it was, if it needed to be nor notarized, or anything.

265
00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:49.215
P34: or

266
00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:57.770
P34: and if it didn't, I would have printed it sign. I had him sign it, or I just sign it, whatever it needed to be done, and then I would have uploaded that

267
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:04.539
P34: where it asks for a document giving me legal authority.

268
00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:09.680
Moderator: Got it. Thank you so much for talking through that that's really helpful to hear.

269
00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:10.350
P34: Okay.

270
00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:13.420
Moderator: I guess. Continue on, is just if you were doing it for real.

271
00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:17.960
P34: Okay.

272
00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:24.019
Moderator: Pause you here, and just look over this page and let me know your initial expectations. Here.

273
00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:29.860
P34: Okay, I could see that I could edit it if I needed to.

274
00:24:30.432 --> 00:24:33.390
P34: I checked all of the information

275
00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:34.980
P34: and.

276
00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:42.950
Moderator: Yeah, let's say you did see something you entered by mistake. How would you go about correcting that.

277
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:44.570
P34: I would hit the edit button.

278
00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:46.160
P34: Do you want me to do that?

279
00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:47.319
Moderator: Yeah. Go ahead.

280
00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.190
P34: Okay.

281
00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:55.559
P34: let's edit this one. Okay? So then I would have changed the phone number.

282
00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:05.020
P34: If that's what I needed to do. I would have updated the page. Then I would have looked, to be sure it got updated, and it did.

283
00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:09.000
P34: and then I would have been fine with that.

284
00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:11.919
P34: and I would check the rest of it.

285
00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:21.119
P34: And again I see that I can edit everything.

286
00:25:36.483 --> 00:25:42.639
P34: though, that it says I'm the veteran signing for myself, but I'm the

287
00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:46.130
P34: one applying for it.

288
00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:52.189
P34: I guess I was thinking that

289
00:25:55.010 --> 00:26:00.010
P34: well, we both work together on that, I guess. So maybe that's still okay.

290
00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:06.390
P34: because of a care. What I'm thinking is

291
00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:11.679
P34: as a veteran that's needing a caregiver.

292
00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:16.780
P34: The veteran

293
00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:22.179
P34: may not be

294
00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:34.250
P34: capable up to or knowledgeable on the computer, and all of that for him to be doing the online

295
00:26:35.869 --> 00:26:41.470
P34: fill out or filling out all the forms. So again, it's back to. That's kind of a

296
00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:46.170
P34: it. Maybe it needs to say

297
00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:49.929
P34: I am the applying caregiver.

298
00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.269
P34: That's filling all this out.

299
00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:57.780
P34: and the veteran will sign.

300
00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:03.880
P34: I would have been more comfortable with it, saying something like that. And before I was a caregiver

301
00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:12.940
P34: then saying, because basically, I'm saying I am the veteran and signing for myself, which I'm not, and I'm the one that filled out all the

302
00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:14.510
P34: information.

303
00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:18.640
Moderator: Got it. Thank you so much for explaining that.

304
00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:20.420
P34: Yeah, I don't know if that's a

305
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:23.420
P34: a factor for most people.

306
00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:33.739
P34: But I can see. Yeah, I can see it being an issue. I'm thinking of another veteran that's no good on. He can't do anything on the computer. But his wife would have been able to do it.

307
00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:38.219
P34: or his daughter would have done it, but he would have been lost. With all this.

308
00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:48.300
Moderator: Yeah, thank you for kind of talking through all that and all that detail. So your comfort level would. Here, you'd be more comfortable if it was

309
00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:51.599
Moderator: more obvious that you're the one that completed the form.

310
00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:52.740
P34: Right.

311
00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:59.640
P34: or just saying I'm completing the form for the veteran, because I am going to be the caregiver, I something of that sort.

312
00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:01.450
P34: And then

313
00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:04.420
P34: that kind of leads back to

314
00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:09.240
P34: where it was saying that I needed to upload a document.

315
00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:16.520
P34: Maybe what it needs to say is, I'm filling this out for the veteran, because

316
00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:21.530
P34: he's not tech savvy, or something or not capable?

317
00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:25.540
P34: It's great feedback.

318
00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:33.739
P34: Yeah. I suppose if he's not capable, then I would have had one of those forms. But tech savvy at the age group that so many of us are in

319
00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:37.209
P34: might be just a better thing.

320
00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:50.030
P34: It's kind of like with government stuff you want to be careful that you're not getting yourself in trouble by doing something and swearing that you're the one that did it?

321
00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:53.080
P34: Do you know what I'm saying?

322
00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:56.386
Moderator: Yeah, that totally makes sense. Thanks for talking through that.

323
00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.100
Moderator: Yeah. If you just go ahead and.

324
00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:03.240
P34: Here I would have. Yeah, that's where again I would have liked to have said.

325
00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.739
P34: it's not

326
00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:07.889
P34: the veteran that's filling it out.

327
00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:35.640
Moderator: And what are your thoughts as you're reading through this piece.

328
00:29:35.928 --> 00:29:39.101
P34: I'm trying to remember if it was the same thing I

329
00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:44.899
P34: that it said when I signed up, but I think it is, I don't think anything's changed.

330
00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:57.949
P34: and I understand all of that, that I'm not an employee.

331
00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:03.030
P34: And I would have clicked on this and read the privacy policy.

332
00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:05.300
P34: Do you want me to do that or not?

333
00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:08.059
Moderator: Yeah, you can. If that's what you normally do.

334
00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:14.160
P34: See if I can get the window to move without losing you

335
00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:16.700
P34: there.

336
00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:35.770
P34: And I would have read this thoroughly.

337
00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:36.920
P34: Okay.

338
00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:40.380
P34: yeah.

339
00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:41.570
P34: okay.

340
00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:55.650
Moderator: Okay, gonna go back to the form. Let me know if there's anything else that you want to share about this page. But I won't have you actually submit. We'll pause before you do that.

341
00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:00.719
P34: No, I think I would have been comfortable with all that.

342
00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:03.780
P34: so I would assigned it.

343
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.890
P34: Okay.

344
00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:08.680
P34: you. You want me to go ahead and do that.

345
00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:12.460
Moderator: Yeah, go ahead and do that, and just let me know if there's anything else about that page.

346
00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:29.990
P34: See, this is where I was talking about. According to Federal law. I'm saying he filled it out, and I'm the one that filled it out. And I don't like that

347
00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:32.090
P34: on this note.

348
00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:32.900
P34: Yeah.

349
00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:36.349
P34: So I would have definitely preferred it to be different.

350
00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:39.020
Moderator: Great thanks for sharing that.

351
00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:40.350
P34: So.

352
00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:44.990
Moderator: Submit. We're in the testing environment so it won't let you actually submit anything here.

353
00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:45.710
P34: Okay.

354
00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:52.939
Moderator: So at this point I'm going to swap the screen share. And I'm gonna take over screen sharing for a second.

355
00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:53.940
P34: Okay.

356
00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:59.350
Moderator: And I would like to get your feedback on the Confirmation page. What would have happened

357
00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:04.330
Moderator: if you would have hit submit. Let's see, where is it? There it is.

358
00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:18.069
Moderator: Okay. So if we would have hit that Submit application Page would have arrived here. I'm gonna scroll through this page. Just let me know if I'm going too fast or too slow, and just let me know any of your thoughts or expectations. Here.

359
00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:21.970
Moderator: I'm gonna adjust the window because it's wiggling a bit.

360
00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:32.859
P34: And I would have screen or, okay, I would have printed this page.

361
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:36.050
P34: I probably would have printed it and screenshot it both.

362
00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:37.170
Moderator: Okay.

363
00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:52.570
P34: Okay?

364
00:32:57.820 --> 00:32:59.210
P34: And I've

365
00:32:59.290 --> 00:33:03.420
P34: understand all of that if it's denied and how to get a review.

366
00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:07.350
P34: So for me, that would been fine.

367
00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:09.090
Moderator: Okay.

368
00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:15.309
P34: And then I would have stopped here, and I would have read the program of General

369
00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:17.450
P34: Caregiver sport services.

370
00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:20.610
Moderator: Okay.

371
00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:25.560
Moderator: anything else about this page?

372
00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:39.249
P34: I probably would have wrote the phone number down at the same time. But I'm would have done. Yeah, I

373
00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:42.850
P34: try not to lose anything.

374
00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:44.990
P34: So that's fine.

375
00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:46.940
Moderator: Okay?

376
00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:56.809
Moderator: Yeah. Because if you had a magic wand and had a perfect and it was a perfect world, what would you like to see, here is anything missing or.

377
00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:01.410
P34: Oh.

378
00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:12.229
P34: I didn't see a way that I could have saved the page. So go back up to the top

379
00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:16.500
P34: because a lot of people don't have printers.

380
00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:20.079
P34: and once in a while my printer doesn't work.

381
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:23.889
Moderator: Got it.

382
00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:29.450
P34: And most people, probably older people don't know how to do.

383
00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:31.639
P34: Take a picture of it, or snip

384
00:34:32.489 --> 00:34:38.730
P34: and save it that away. So it might have been good if it would have asked, do you want to save this page?

385
00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:42.499
Moderator: Thanks for that feedback. That's really helpful.

386
00:34:46.029 --> 00:34:46.849
Moderator: Okay.

387
00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:53.959
Moderator: I'm going to stop sharing now and kind of go back to a couple final questions as we wrap up.

388
00:34:54.159 --> 00:34:54.829
P34: Okay.

389
00:34:54.830 --> 00:34:56.399
Moderator: Oops lost my thing.

390
00:34:56.590 --> 00:35:05.700
Moderator: Okay? So you've mentioned, you did a lot of research online on your own. Can you kind of talk through what other research you would do before applying and completing a form like this.

391
00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:10.849
P34: I would have pulled up the form and printed it

392
00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:13.910
P34: before I would have applied online.

393
00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:19.599
P34: just so that I was familiar with it. I had a time to look at it, and just be sure that I

394
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:23.239
P34: understood everything and didn't have any questions about it.

395
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:24.330
P34: Okay.

396
00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:27.389
P34: I do a lot of googling.

397
00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:29.240
P34: So

398
00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:38.000
P34: and like, I said, I always go to the Va website and see what I can find out there.

399
00:35:39.129 --> 00:35:40.949
P34: Before I

400
00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:43.460
P34: even apply for anything.

401
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:44.660
P34: Okay.

402
00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:47.930
P34: next.

403
00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:49.040
Moderator: What are your thoughts?

404
00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:49.710
P34: Okay.

405
00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:50.640
Moderator: Yeah.

406
00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:57.589
Moderator: And what are your thoughts on the amount of information provided in the form? Do you think it was too much just enough or too little.

407
00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:00.269
P34: No, I think it was just right.

408
00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:01.990
Moderator: Okay.

409
00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:08.370
Moderator: is there any additional information about who qualifies as a primary or secondary caregiver? You would have liked to see.

410
00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:11.659
P34: No, I think the list was sufficient.

411
00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:12.990
Moderator: Okay.

412
00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:18.780
Moderator: do you have anything else you want to add about what we went over today, or any questions for me.

413
00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:21.789
P34: Don't think so.

414
00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:23.840
Moderator: Okay.

415
00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:34.679
Moderator: And I just want to circle back and reconfirm. Now that we've gone through everything, if you're comfortable, if we share a video clip of the session with our Va. Partners removing any and all identifying information.

416
00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:36.440
Moderator: If you would be okay with that.

417
00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:36.975
P34: Yes.

418
00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:47.469
Moderator: Okay, thank you. Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is really really helpful as we iterate and try and improve the site for veterans and caregivers.

419
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:49.740
P34: Okay. Cool. Sounds good.

420
00:36:50.270 --> 00:37:01.909
Moderator: The Gn. Who will be sending you a thank you. Note. They're the ones that recruited you and set you all up for this. They'll be sending a little blurb. You can pass along to other veterans and caregivers that might want might want to participate in future research studies.

421
00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:03.880
P34: Sounds good! Oh.

422
00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:08.380
Moderator: Yeah, that's all I have for you today. So thank you again. And I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.

423
00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:09.160
P34: Thank you.

424
00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:11.710
P34: Have a great day. Okay? Bye.
