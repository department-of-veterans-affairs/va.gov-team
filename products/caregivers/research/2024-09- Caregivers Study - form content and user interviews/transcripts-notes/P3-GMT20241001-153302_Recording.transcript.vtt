Moderator: Okay. So I have started recording just to confirm, are you comfortable? If I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

2
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.420
P3: I am comfortable.

3
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:20.670
Moderator: Okay? And are you comfortable? If we decided to use a video clip from our discussion today to share with other Va partners? If we removed any information that could be used to identify you.

4
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.280
P3: I am comfortable.

5
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.640
Moderator: Okay, thank you.

6
00:00:24.045 --> 00:00:27.600
Moderator: Our other observers here. So I'm gonna let Lois in.

7
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.140
Moderator: Okay.

8
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.100
Moderator: Hi Lois, please feel free to come on screen and introduce yourself to Leela before we get started.

9
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.089
Observer: Hi, thank you so much for joining us today. Really appreciate your feedback.

10
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.009
P3: You're welcome. Thank you.

11
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.580
Moderator: Thanks, Lois.

12
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:07.030
Moderator: Alright, Leela. So before we take a look at that forum I was talking about together.

13
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.370
Moderator: I have a few questions for you about the caregiver application experience. So

14
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:20.249
Moderator: is it accurate that you are part of the program of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers.

15
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.370
P3: Yes.

16
00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.149
Moderator: That's what I have in my records. Okay.

17
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.590
Moderator: great

18
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.279
Moderator: And let me see how long ago it says you applied.

19
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.840
Moderator: Nope.

20
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.279
Moderator: is it accurate that you enrolled over 2 years ago.

21
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.320
P3: Yes.

22
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.170
Moderator: Okay. And how? How about how long ago was it? Do you know.

23
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.340
P3: I wanna say it was about 2,000.

24
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.280
P3: I want to say so. It may have been about 4 years.

25
00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:59.480
Moderator: Okay.

26
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.599
P3: We have been 19 between 19 and 2,02020, I mean.

27
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.219
Moderator: Okay, it's like 2,000.

28
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.993
P3: I'm sorry.

29
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:07.799
P3: 2020.

30
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:16.269
Moderator: That's okay. Okay, Gotcha. If you were to explain the caregiver program to someone who was interested in enrolling, how would you explain it?

31
00:02:17.457 --> 00:02:21.902
P3: I would explain to them. Well, 1st of all, I'd ask them if they

32
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.149
P3: were a caregiver of a military veteran.

33
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.819
P3: If they were I'd ask them

34
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:41.349
P3: without being too personal. What was the percentage? Or you know, I'm not sure if if it's some of them are rated, based on what the percentage is.

35
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.559
P3: but ask them if they were aware that we had a caregivers program.

36
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:55.619
P3: and if they were not, then I would get them in contact with my contact people through the Va.

37
00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:57.570
P3: So.

38
00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.320
Moderator: Okay.

39
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.010
Moderator: and.

40
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:20.379
P3: And just explain to them how it's kind of explain to them what it offers and the help that they could receive for the veteran. They wouldn't be left out alone to try to care for the needs of the veteran, but it would be very helpful for them to use the program to to help them process through it as well.

41
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:21.440
Moderator: Okay.

42
00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:22.670
Moderator: thank you.

43
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.199
Moderator: Are you familiar with the concept of a primary or secondary caregiver?

44
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.270
P3: Yes.

45
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.660
Moderator: Okay? And do you know which one that you are enrolled as.

46
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.300
P3: Primary. I believe.

47
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:39.390
Moderator: Okay.

48
00:03:40.215 --> 00:03:48.949
Moderator: and then do you remember how you completed the caregiver form? Was that in person or at a facility or online.

49
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:59.000
P3: I believe I did it online because I think it was around Covid time. And so I'm all sure I did it online communicated back and forth online.

50
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.030
P3: and then spoke with someone over the phone.

51
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.980
Moderator: Okay. Do you know who that was? Like? What role type of role.

52
00:04:06.442 --> 00:04:09.680
P3: I think her name is Michelle Thompson.

53
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.080
Moderator: And it was a Va. Employee.

54
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.840
P3: Ma'am.

55
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.000
Moderator: Was that a Va. Employee.

56
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.560
P3: Yes, yes, was a Va. Employee over at the Michael E. Debakey in Houston.

57
00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.510
Moderator: Okay, gotcha.

58
00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:26.640
Moderator: What did you do in preparation for completing that online form?

59
00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.150
P3: Explain?

60
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.499
P3: Can you explain?

61
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:41.660
Moderator: So before you got to the form like, what had you done to that point? To look for information or contact people to find out what you needed to do.

62
00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.879
P3: Oh, okay, I just went online. And you know.

63
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:57.749
P3: put in caregivers program for Va, and just kind of did a little research online. And then it kind of helped to guide me who I needed to be in contact with.

64
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:04.470
Moderator: Okay, gotcha. Do you remember? If that was on va.gov, or outside websites.

65
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:05.970
P3: It was va.gov.

66
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.870
Moderator: Okay.

67
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:18.609
Moderator: gotcha did you complete those Va that Va form and any other forms that you needed to fill out to apply as a caregiver on your own? Or did you have help from

68
00:05:19.235 --> 00:05:24.219
Moderator: someone else like an accredited representative, or a Vso, or another source.

69
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.010
P3: No, I did it on my own.

70
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.730
Moderator: Okay.

71
00:05:27.996 --> 00:05:35.909
Moderator: is there anything else that you'd like to share about your experience with applying for the caregiver program, good or bad.

72
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.070
P3: Hmm!

73
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:45.519
P3: It was a. It was a smooth transition. It wasn't, you know. I was able to understand. And all the information

74
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.570
P3: that was needed, and the

75
00:05:49.930 --> 00:06:06.300
P3: contact person that was there. If I had any questions, it was. It was a simple enough to contact them and get whatever necessary information that I needed. So it I I don't have anything negative about it. It was. It was a pretty smooth transition.

76
00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.530
P3: Okay.

77
00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.570
Moderator: Alright. Thank you.

78
00:06:10.956 --> 00:06:18.663
Moderator: In the Zoom chat. I'm going to share the link to that form. And this is in our testing website. So.

79
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:24.610
Moderator: let me know if you need any help finding the Zoom chat and getting to that link.

80
00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.470
P3: I got it. Do you want me to open the link.

81
00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:34.480
Moderator: Yeah, you can open the link. Put it in a window, or wherever you are comfortable, sharing your screen with me.

82
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:34.980
P3: Okay.

83
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.320
Moderator: And then I'll have you share your screen and zoom when you're ready, and you have that pulled up.

84
00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:41.340
P3: Thanks.

85
00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.280
P3: Let me

86
00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.820
P3: make this one a little bit smaller, so I can see it.

87
00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.620
P3: Guess I had too much stuff open this morning.

88
00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.390
Moderator: Busy, busy.

89
00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:06.580
P3: Okay, there, we go.

90
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.349
P3: Okay, got it.

91
00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:20.339
Moderator: Okay. So now I'd like you to share your screen with me in zoom, it's the green button on the bottom. It should say, Share.

92
00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.019
P3: let's see, the caregiver. Application

93
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.399
P3: is that it.

94
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.429
Moderator: Yeah. Should be.

95
00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.130
Moderator: yes, okay, perfect.

96
00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:33.150
P3: Time, doing that.

97
00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.610
Moderator: Oh, nice! That doesn't usually go so smoothly the 1st time.

98
00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:52.329
Moderator: Okay, so I'd like you to kind of review through this page as you would if you were going to apply and tell me about your initial thoughts and expectations of this form before going forward and applying.

99
00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:00.520
P3: Now, one thing I did

100
00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:08.629
P3: question was, I didn't understand the 2 different types of programs because you have

101
00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:16.599
P3: the paid side, and you have the non paid side, which I believe is the general, is the basic.

102
00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.939
P3: which is what I'm a part of.

103
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:23.889
P3: But I I try. I was trying to apply for the stipend side.

104
00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:26.016
P3: And so

105
00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:32.250
P3: When I was denied I was very, you know, kind of confused about that. I didn't understand that.

106
00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:34.520
P3: and so I guess. The

107
00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:37.549
P3: only thing that I could say about

108
00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:43.590
P3: when you're applying, I guess, is trying to get the understanding. Okay, exactly what it is that I'm applying for.

109
00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:49.729
P3: and the the understanding that there needs to be something said that there's actually 2 sides to this

110
00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.100
P3: program.

111
00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:57.769
P3: And so if you go in blind like me, I'm thinking. Oh, I'm applying for the stipend side, and

112
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:08.380
P3: you know, once it's once it was denied I was. You know I didn't. I thought I was kicked out of the program until they reached back out to me

113
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:14.859
P3: and kind of explained it to me. And then then I understood. Okay. Then I became part of the general because I wasn't.

114
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:20.020
P3: I wasn't sure what that was. So that was the only thing going in that I

115
00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.970
P3: I guess that there was some confusion.

116
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:24.110
Moderator: Okay.

117
00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:32.329
Moderator: So if you looked at this page, would you think you were applying for a stipend side or not? Non stipend.

118
00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.069
P3: That's what I thought. Yes.

119
00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:35.650
Moderator: The stipend.

120
00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:37.809
P3: Let me see.

121
00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:43.950
P3: see cause it just says

122
00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:47.700
P3: assistance for family caregivers. So

123
00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:51.640
P3: I would

124
00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:54.500
P3: assume that I was applying for a stipend.

125
00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:55.720
Moderator: Okay.

126
00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:04.179
Moderator: Gotcha, is anything on this page standing out to you as being confusing or particularly helpful?

127
00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:12.319
P3: Nothing looks confusing because they've they've got plenty of phone numbers here. So you've got

128
00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:16.170
P3: you've got contacts. So if you have a question.

129
00:10:16.703 --> 00:10:23.959
P3: you can reach out. There's there's quite a bit of needing help information there. So

130
00:10:24.598 --> 00:10:26.431
P3: I believe it's it's

131
00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:32.500
P3: It's it's well put together. If you had questions you could ask.

132
00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:36.020
P3: so I think it looks good.

133
00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:43.110
Moderator: Okay, if you were to rate this scale on or this page on a scale of one to 5,

134
00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:56.079
Moderator: one being bad, 5 being best. How prepared and informed do you feel about the application you're about to begin based on this pages? Content one to 5.

135
00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:10.259
P3: I I would go ahead and give it a 5, because I'm looking at the number one where it says your eligibility. So if I go click on that it's gonna automatically tell me

136
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:14.530
P3: what I'm eligible for. It should be able to tell me if it's

137
00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:19.849
P3: if it's general I'm hoping if it's general, or if I'm eligible for stipend.

138
00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:26.159
P3: so that right there is is the beginning, and then you just go from there. So I I would say, it's

139
00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:28.000
P3: it's well put together.

140
00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:29.760
P3: Yeah, it's 5.

141
00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:36.440
Moderator: Alright! I'd like you to start the form as if you're applying for the program next.

142
00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:38.789
P3: So start the application.

143
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:39.300
Moderator: Yep.

144
00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:40.430
P3: Okay.

145
00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:41.930
P3: there, we go.

146
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:59.690
Moderator: Okay, so you can just kind of go through the form and fill things out. And just as a reminder, this is a testing site. So you do not have to worry about any of the information you enter today. Going anywhere. You can use real or fake information. I am going to give you a fake social security number when we get to that step

147
00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.889
Moderator: and fake anything you don't want to share.

148
00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:04.560
P3: Copy.

149
00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:11.520
Moderator: As you're going through the form. Just please think aloud as much as possible. We want to hear about any reactions that you're having.

150
00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:12.610
P3: Okay.

151
00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:17.399
P3: okay, everything looks good so far.

152
00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:22.640
P3: So you'll put in the social security. But everything looks good there. Name.

153
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.150
P3: his social date of birth and mail

154
00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.250
P3: you hit continue.

155
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:30.160
P3: Okay.

156
00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:31.829
P3: Id is the same

157
00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:37.250
P3: as is social. So they skipped that. So we'll have to go from there.

158
00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:42.469
Moderator: This one I can give you a number to put in. Do 3, 2, 1.

159
00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.389
Moderator: 4, 5, 6.

160
00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:47.800
P3: Okay.

161
00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:49.110
Moderator: 7, 8, 9.

162
00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:50.743
P3: That works.

163
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:53.170
Moderator: Like a fake valid

164
00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:55.399
Moderator: that we can use.

165
00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:55.850
P3: Okay.

166
00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:56.450
Moderator: Bye.

167
00:12:56.710 --> 00:13:00.730
P3: Got the no po box, so go to the address.

168
00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:29.800
Moderator: Could you tell me why you're pausing on this one.

169
00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:34.870
P3: Well, I'm looking. It says, why we ask for this information.

170
00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:44.309
P3: and I used to just plop it down and say, providing the country where the veteran lives helps determine the caregiver support team.

171
00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:49.859
P3: I wouldn't think that it was in another country, but I guess that makes sense.

172
00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:54.390
P3: So that's why I pause. I was like, well.

173
00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:56.919
P3: I live in the U.S.A. You know.

174
00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:59.140
P3: is that you know I'll I'll

175
00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:02.139
P3: so no, that made sense.

176
00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.059
P3: Well, it turned red.

177
00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.409
Moderator: Yeah. Why do you think it did that.

178
00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:11.620
P3: Let me see.

179
00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.889
P3: Oh, because it's not a country. It's a county.

180
00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:20.339
Moderator: It is not you. We've been having a lot of problems with that.

181
00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:22.600
Moderator: So this is just proof that it.

182
00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:23.090
P3: Yes.

183
00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:23.950
Moderator: Be changed.

184
00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:41.380
P3: Yes. Well, that makes sense, because you know, they may have special. Well, every county has something different. I live in Brazoria County. Harris County has something else. Angleton County, somebody else has something else. So they want to put them with

185
00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:45.270
P3: someone that's closer to where they are. So that makes sense.

186
00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:46.280
Moderator: Okay.

187
00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:53.020
P3: And I would have figured that out. When you know you look at a lot of applications and county and country and

188
00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:57.100
P3: okay, they wanted street address. I thought I did that up there.

189
00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:00.020
P3: Oh, because it's online, too.

190
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:03.119
P3: Let's just take that off of there and put it on line one.

191
00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:08.770
P3: Okay, there we go.

192
00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:13.329
P3: which that's that's it's telling you what

193
00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:17.080
P3: it needs you to fix. So that makes sense. So it's

194
00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:29.070
P3: I guess it's picking up any errors. So not to slow down the process of this application. Because if you put something in wrong and then they have to kick it back out, it's gonna take them just as much time to

195
00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:32.909
P3: get back to you to fix it. So that makes a lot of sense.

196
00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:33.590
Moderator: Okay.

197
00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:37.900
P3: Okay, veteran's primary phone number

198
00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.750
P3: alternate number.

199
00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:51.080
P3: I'm just throwing in some stuff.

200
00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.120
P3: -Oh, what did I do wrong?

201
00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:58.030
P3: Okay, I need another number in there. There we go.

202
00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:08.140
P3: There we go.

203
00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:12.040
P3: Okay.

204
00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:23.330
P3: where the Va Medical center. Yeah, that makes sense. So we need to put there.

205
00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:29.999
Moderator: And how would you prefer to search for a Va. Facility here.

206
00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:34.849
P3: Probably city and state.

207
00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:36.260
Moderator: Okay.

208
00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:50.029
P3: cause. Well, a lot of times they don't have them. They just have the clinics. So Houston is pulling in a lot of people from way out. So

209
00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:53.969
P3: if you want me to hit the search button, Nope, I've already put it in there.

210
00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:59.439
P3: So it's asking for a clinic.

211
00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:02.650
Moderator: Yeah. What would you do next.

212
00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:06.209
P3: And for there I would put Michael E. Debakey.

213
00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.649
P3: because I'm familiar with that.

214
00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:18.389
P3: and see if that works Houston.

215
00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:25.050
P3: So there it is.

216
00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:30.220
P3: so that lets me know that they've got these other clinics here

217
00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:34.819
P3: and the hospitals right there. I know exactly where that is, so.

218
00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:35.930
Moderator: Okay.

219
00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:38.099
P3: I clicked the hospital

220
00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:47.220
P3: because I'm familiar with, you know. If I'm now. If I was a new person coming into town then I guess that would be an issue for me. But

221
00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.660
P3: obviously

222
00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:57.049
P3: If you've been to the Va. Then, you know, that's that's probably where you'd start at.

223
00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:58.050
Moderator: Okay.

224
00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:07.370
P3: Michael E. Debakey, and then, if it's not close to where you live, then it's probably gonna point you to a clinic closest to your address. I guess.

225
00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:08.450
Moderator: Okay.

226
00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:12.039
Moderator: could you go back to that page? I wanna ask you a couple more questions.

227
00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.600
P3: So that one right here, okay.

228
00:18:15.541 --> 00:18:23.909
Moderator: So let's say you wanted to change the facility that you selected by doing a new search. Could you walk me through? How you do that?

229
00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:26.470
P3: And

230
00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:29.899
P3: well, not going back is not gonna work.

231
00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:38.230
P3: I go back and type it in again

232
00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:40.010
P3: right.

233
00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:40.750
Moderator: Okay.

234
00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:44.610
P3: Well, let me see Houston, Texas. Let me try that.

235
00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:48.709
P3: There we go.

236
00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:58.800
P3: It's right there, so I guess, just putting the City and state in, I was still able to get right back to, even if I didn't know the name of the facility

237
00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.639
P3: putting in the city and State brought it right there.

238
00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:02.800
Moderator: Okay.

239
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:04.210
P3: So.

240
00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:09.560
Moderator: So.

241
00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:16.589
Moderator: what are your thoughts about this facility, selection page? And why did you choose the facility that you did.

242
00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:21.950
P3: As I'm familiar with it. That's the one we use.

243
00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:22.820
Moderator: Okay.

244
00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:24.100
P3: And so

245
00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:25.620
P3: that's familiar.

246
00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:28.130
P3: and it's the closest one to me.

247
00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:34.299
Moderator: Gotcha. So that's the one that the veteran you are a caregiver for is currently using correct.

248
00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:35.760
P3: Yes, yes.

249
00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:37.240
Moderator: Gotcha

250
00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:53.129
Moderator: so on a scale of one to 5. I'm curious. How you would rate the process here of selecting a va facility, one being bad or difficult to do, and 5 being very easy to do.

251
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:56.310
P3: I think it was very easy to do.

252
00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:00.920
Moderator: So 5.

253
00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:02.690
P3: Yes.

254
00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:03.670
Moderator: Okay.

255
00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:06.630
Moderator: you can continue on.

256
00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:07.420
P3: Okay.

257
00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:11.750
Moderator: So what does the term primary caregiver mean to you?

258
00:20:13.086 --> 00:20:14.869
P3: The number one person.

259
00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:23.569
P3: the one that's doing all the work, you know. More likely this, the spouse of the the veteran.

260
00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:33.029
P3: the primary person that or live the one that lives in the house with them. That's doing the majority of at least 90% of the work.

261
00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:41.019
Moderator: Okay, so let's go through a scenario where you want to add a primary caregiver on this application.

262
00:20:41.526 --> 00:20:48.049
Moderator: I want you to go through the next few pages and try to add that and think aloud about your thought process.

263
00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:49.770
P3: Okay.

264
00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:54.580
P3: would you like to apply for benefits for a primary caregiver? Yes.

265
00:20:56.804 --> 00:21:03.339
P3: So enter the primary caregiver's legal name. That's documented with social security

266
00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:11.920
P3: in the middle.

267
00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:13.130
P3: No.

268
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:26.029
P3: that's the spouse. So

269
00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:27.780
P3: that's a lady.

270
00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:30.030
P3: Oh.

271
00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:38.689
P3: on the calculus

272
00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:40.020
P3: email

273
00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:43.729
P3: relationship to the veteran spouse.

274
00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.459
P3: That was very simple.

275
00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:52.740
P3: All of that went, you know. That was very simple.

276
00:21:54.698 --> 00:21:56.970
P3: We recommend providing the

277
00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:00.749
P3: to social security number.

278
00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:07.480
P3: I guess that's a way also to ensure that if you say you're the spouse. Then the Social Security

279
00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:13.379
P3: Information should line up, and they will know that you are really the spouse. So

280
00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:16.269
P3: make up a number

281
00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:18.430
P3: right.

282
00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:20.990
Moderator: Yeah, it might not let you do that one.

283
00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:22.002
P3: Don't let me.

284
00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:23.879
Moderator: 3, 2, 1.

285
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:25.920
P3: Hmm, 3, 2, 1.

286
00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:28.680
Moderator: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

287
00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:30.340
P3: 7, 8 9 per month. Okay.

288
00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:35.759
Moderator: Tell you. Yeah, okay, we put that somewhere else. Just change like one number in there doesn't matter which one.

289
00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:40.949
P3: 2, 1, 4. 0, it wants me to change one. Let's go. Will it take a 0?

290
00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:42.990
P3: Yes, it did.

291
00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:45.810
Moderator: Okay.

292
00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:54.599
P3: Okay, the home address is at the same. So yes, that will avoid having to fill all that out. So it picked that up

293
00:22:55.690 --> 00:23:00.519
P3: as a primary caregiver's mailing address, the same as their home address. Yes.

294
00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:04.530
P3: that was all easy.

295
00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:09.030
P3: Primary caregivers, contact information.

296
00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:12.040
P3: primary phone number.

297
00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.350
P3: alternate

298
00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:25.560
P3: email.

299
00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:34.630
P3: tutu.com.

300
00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:38.050
P3: That was easy.

301
00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:43.180
Moderator: Okay, so what does a secondary caregiver mean to you?

302
00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:51.029
P3: Secondary caregiver means to me like we have 2 adult sons. And so that would be

303
00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:54.670
P3: my backups, like when I'm respite or

304
00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:57.209
P3: going out of town. So

305
00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:58.920
P3: that's what that would be.

306
00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:08.039
Moderator: Gotcha. And how do you think that the secondary role differs in the application process and the benefits that they get with the primary giver?

307
00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:09.890
Moderator: Primary caregiver.

308
00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:11.650
P3: Hmm!

309
00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:15.000
P3: Well.

310
00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:21.229
P3: I don't. I mean, if they're just a backup, they're just taking my spot when I'm not there.

311
00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:22.770
P3: I don't think

312
00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:26.500
P3: they necessarily need benefits.

313
00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:32.099
P3: they're just, you know, just taking a spot from me.

314
00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:34.959
P3: I don't think I mean they should have

315
00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:38.969
P3: a little bit more information about them.

316
00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:42.949
P3: I don't know if

317
00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:47.818
P3: well, in this case

318
00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:54.339
P3: I don't have to really think about that one. In this case. My son is a

319
00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:56.129
P3: veteran as well.

320
00:24:56.210 --> 00:25:04.180
P3: and so he's in the system as well. So if I put his information in there, it'll pop up, and it's all true, because it would show that

321
00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:09.379
P3: I guess I would.

322
00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:14.629
P3: I would be concerned with. Okay, there are secondary.

323
00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:18.219
P3: Well, I gotta look at it another way. If I died.

324
00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:23.549
P3: that secondary is going to have to take that, take my spot. So they need this information

325
00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:39.219
P3: and they need it available in the event that this happens right away. I get in a car accident or something, and my my veterans at home, and we need to get this in place. Really, quick! There's not enough time to jump in and get a fiduciary

326
00:25:39.592 --> 00:25:44.280
P3: we gotta. We gotta jump on this. So we have this already in the system.

327
00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:53.000
P3: Then that makes sense. So if that's the route that they're looking at, then yes, they need the information, and then I guess you would have to

328
00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:58.369
P3: contact this secondary person and say, Hey, are you willing to be a secondary

329
00:25:58.897 --> 00:26:02.399
P3: caregiver for my spouse in the event of

330
00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:06.400
P3: my death, or I'm not able to care for him?

331
00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:16.399
P3: And this is what the Va. Will need. They're gonna need some personal information. Are you comfortable with that? So yes, that makes sense. All of that.

332
00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:20.270
P3: The same things that they needed from me.

333
00:26:20.895 --> 00:26:23.520
P3: Yeah, I think that's necessary.

334
00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:24.710
Moderator: Okay.

335
00:26:25.536 --> 00:26:30.580
Moderator: so you can go ahead. And as though you are adding a a secondary caregiver.

336
00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:33.930
Moderator: just continue to think aloud as you're going through.

337
00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:34.690
P3: Hey?

338
00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:36.950
P3: Name

339
00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:42.719
P3: happens to be the same as mine, and then that's

340
00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:45.940
P3: It's not a junior senior or anything. So

341
00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:49.729
P3: january one.

342
00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:52.590
P3: No, not 20.

343
00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:53.630
P3: And

344
00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.230
P3: let's I'll make him older.

345
00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:01.730
P3: A male.

346
00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:04.420
P3: And the relationship is

347
00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:10.620
P3: his son. So that's all that all looks good.

348
00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:11.470
P3: Okay.

349
00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:14.170
P3: okay.

350
00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:17.799
P3: yeah. They want our numbers again. 3, 2, 1,

351
00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:21.789
P3: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,

352
00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:24.820
P3: make another different. Number 2. There we go.

353
00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:29.429
Moderator: How would you go about getting that information if you needed it for real.

354
00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:39.940
P3: I have it so it wouldn't be hard for me to do, because that is my son. But if I did not have it like say, for instance, it was a nephew I trusted, or

355
00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:47.580
P3: we didn't have kids, or whatever, or a niece. I would like, I said, before I got to this point of the

356
00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:50.970
P3: application, I would contact them

357
00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:56.110
P3: and find out if they were comfortable with giving that information to me or

358
00:27:56.641 --> 00:28:00.510
P3: would it be okay. I mean, I'd have to be pretty

359
00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:02.719
P3: close to this person

360
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:13.109
P3: for them to take on the role that I would have been doing for however long, so I would assume that they would be very comfortable in giving that to me

361
00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:15.919
P3: so, or either I would already have it.

362
00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:17.000
Moderator: Okay.

363
00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:19.130
Moderator: Keep going.

364
00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:20.340
P3: And

365
00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:24.019
P3: so that's a different address. So let's

366
00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:27.710
P3: Nope. That's not right.

367
00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:29.840
P3: No, that's right. That's right.

368
00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:32.599
P3: That's what I did last time

369
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:37.350
P3: Cherry Street.

370
00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:41.790
Moderator: So you just know this off the top of your head.

371
00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:43.619
P3: No, I'm making this up.

372
00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:47.750
Moderator: If you had to enter it for real. How would you get that information.

373
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:57.040
P3: Oh, if I had to get this information if right now it's my son. So I have that available to me. I just pull out my trusty phone

374
00:28:57.210 --> 00:28:58.620
P3: and pull up

375
00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:01.570
P3: my contacts and and type it in

376
00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:07.580
P3: and like. I said I would more likely, if this is the person that we were going to be using

377
00:29:08.244 --> 00:29:16.980
P3: then I would already have this information. Anyway, they would have to be pretty close to me to be able to pass that information

378
00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:19.170
P3: or to pass that

379
00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:21.629
P3: role to them.

380
00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:27.160
P3: And that's the county again.

381
00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:39.470
P3: Nope, it's not the same. Wait, let me see, is secondary caregivers mailing address, the same as their home address. Yes, it is.

382
00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:43.389
Moderator: What did you think it said? Initially.

383
00:29:44.867 --> 00:29:48.209
P3: If they're what did I think it said?

384
00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:53.290
P3: If their mailing address was the same as mine.

385
00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:54.550
Moderator: Okay.

386
00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:58.460
P3: Because I'm I'm looking at it. That's my son. So

387
00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:02.750
P3: you know, he could have been living with me, and it wasn't so

388
00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:05.779
P3: as primary number

389
00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:12.190
P3: secondaries like a cell

390
00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:16.590
P3: and his email address.

391
00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:20.150
P3: I would more likely have that as well.

392
00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:22.290
P3: But if not.

393
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.889
P3: I should, especially with technology.

394
00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:30.490
P3: I would have it, because I'd be communicating with him back and forth.

395
00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:31.610
Moderator: Okay.

396
00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:36.330
P3: Yeah, yeah.

397
00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:40.500
P3: okay.

398
00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:47.019
Moderator: Okay, so let's go through as though we're adding an additional secondary caregiver as well.

399
00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:47.610
P3: Okay.

400
00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:50.290
P3: so they want another one.

401
00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.490
P3: I'd say, Yes.

402
00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:04.819
P3: I can say no. But then, if that certain person is with me, then we go back to the same problem we had before.

403
00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:08.310
P3: so we'd have to add another person

404
00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:12.689
P3: which would be my second son. I have 2 sons, so

405
00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:17.400
P3: then we do the same thing, and I have his information just like

406
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:20.320
P3: I have the other one. So it's available to me.

407
00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:23.210
Moderator: Okay.

408
00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:24.270
P3: Automatic.

409
00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:25.900
P3: That's wrong.

410
00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:42.820
P3: Birthday.

411
00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:48.820
P3: Okay, it's a male.

412
00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:51.690
P3: So

413
00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:54.940
P3: it was pretty

414
00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:59.579
P3: pretty self explanatory. I mean, everything matches

415
00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:03.870
P3: the same thing we were doing. Oh, let's see 1, 2, 3!

416
00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:05.650
P3: That's wrong.

417
00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:10.309
P3: There we go.

418
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:11.859
Moderator: Getting the hang of this fake social security.

419
00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:12.865
P3: Yeah.

420
00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:15.010
P3: okay.

421
00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:16.830
P3: no.

422
00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:23.670
P3: no. So they're not the same address. So it's asking if he lives with us, which he does not.

423
00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:26.570
P3: So then we put his address.

424
00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:31.040
P3: I'll put him on Peach Street since the other one was on Cherry Street.

425
00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:37.650
P3: Okay.

426
00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:46.969
P3: it's pretty simple most of the time. It's just about reading, and sometimes we get in such a hurry.

427
00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:54.410
P3: which I know I do sometimes that I jump the gun and just don't take the time to, you know.

428
00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:55.640
P3: to read it.

429
00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:56.670
P3: Yeah.

430
00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:03.600
P3: okay.

431
00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:08.559
P3: And that's helpful. With the red.

432
00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:12.969
P3: Pop it up, saying, Hey, you messed up something. Go back and take a look.

433
00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:19.540
P3: Is this additional secondary caregivers mailing address the same as their home address? Yes.

434
00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:25.180
P3: So we want their phone numbers.

435
00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:35.509
P3: And I have their home numbers, or rather their cell phone numbers. And

436
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:43.930
P3: I have their emails. And I have their work numbers in case of any kind of emergency.

437
00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:45.540
P3: Okay.

438
00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:56.340
P3: okay.

439
00:33:58.030 --> 00:33:58.930
P3: -Oh.

440
00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:02.810
P3: mister. Mr. Number.

441
00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:03.970
Moderator: I think so.

442
00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:08.650
P3: There we go!

443
00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:11.870
P3: There we go!

444
00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:19.849
Moderator: Okay. If you were filling this out for real, do you think that you would want to sit down and complete this form with those.

445
00:34:19.889 --> 00:34:23.859
Moderator: you know with your sons, or would you do it yourself, like you just did.

446
00:34:25.576 --> 00:34:32.239
P3: If I didn't have their information well, 1st of all, I would talk to them and tell them that this is what I was gonna do

447
00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:38.270
P3: prior to getting started, because I want to know how they feel about it. And if they're comfortable with it.

448
00:34:38.949 --> 00:34:39.359
Moderator: Oh!

449
00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:44.290
P3: If I got in the middle of the application and saw that I'd stop.

450
00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:46.757
P3: and then I would call them

451
00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:50.539
P3: cause I obviously I wouldn't have known prior to that.

452
00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:57.840
P3: that I had to get to those steps, so I would probably stop the process and call them and and talk to them about it and see if it's okay.

453
00:34:58.770 --> 00:35:00.799
P3: Make sure they're comfortable with it.

454
00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:02.969
Moderator: Gotcha. Okay?

455
00:35:05.113 --> 00:35:08.019
Moderator: You can keep going through the next pages.

456
00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:15.859
P3: Now we've guide you through the steps to review and sign this application. First, st we need you to know. We need to know if the veteran will sign this application.

457
00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:22.259
P3: or a representative will sign it. Representative must have legal authority to make decisions on behalf of the veteran.

458
00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:34.589
P3: or must have authority to fill out this application on behalf of the veteran you select that you're the veteran's representative will ask you to upload a document that proves that you have this authority.

459
00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:41.509
P3: Okay? So if I get to this point, and I'm like, I just don't feel like digging that out.

460
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:54.120
P3: and I'll go in there and say, Hey, baby, my husband is a is a blind veteran, so he's legally blind, so I'll I'll tell him what it is I'm doing. And I was like, Hey, I need you to sign this. I'm filling this out.

461
00:35:54.380 --> 00:36:00.060
P3: I need you to sign it, and I'll just go ahead on the lazy side of it, and to have him to do it.

462
00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:05.049
P3: But if he was not having a good day, not feeling good, not

463
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:18.349
P3: really coherent, or whatever, then I would pull out the power of attorney which I've done in the past. It's already in my computer. So all I would need to do is go in and download that power of attorney.

464
00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:22.979
P3: I am also his fiduciary, which is already in the files at the Va.

465
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:29.360
P3: So they have that information. So I would probably just go ahead and

466
00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:33.860
P3: and do it that way, based on what my feelings were at that moment.

467
00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:36.020
P3: So

468
00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:40.730
P3: so I can say I'm a representative

469
00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:44.770
P3: and sign it on his behalf, or

470
00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:47.680
P3: I'll go in there and tell him, can you sign this

471
00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:51.380
P3: and he'll sign it so which one you prefer.

472
00:36:52.957 --> 00:36:55.460
Moderator: Whichever you think you would do realistically.

473
00:36:55.460 --> 00:37:02.809
P3: Well, I would probably ask him first, st and you know he's usually with me. We're together the majority of the time, so

474
00:37:02.890 --> 00:37:05.099
P3: he would probably be the one signing it.

475
00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:06.060
Moderator: Okay.

476
00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:14.020
P3: Okay? So it's reviewing the application, making sure that everything looks good. There's a veterans information.

477
00:37:14.410 --> 00:37:19.580
P3: So that's his name. That's correct his birthday. And actually he is a

478
00:37:21.130 --> 00:37:29.970
P3: senior, so I would look at that and say, Oh, I forgot to put the his suffix in there, because he's junior is a veteran as well.

479
00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:34.089
P3: so I'll go back down here and put Senior

480
00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:40.929
P3: and upload that page. And there it is. So we're good with that. So Security looks, good

481
00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:44.360
P3: address looks good

482
00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:49.290
P3: phone numbers look good. The email that's correct.

483
00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:55.329
P3: It's showing the clinic that he plans to get his health care at. That's correct.

484
00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:59.580
P3: So then we'll go down here to the next section.

485
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:05.530
P3: Apply for the applying for that primary caregiver. That's correct.

486
00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:08.230
P3: the primary. That's me.

487
00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:15.669
P3: My birthday, the female. I'm the spouse. Correct social security number address.

488
00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:20.820
P3: It's the same as a veteran is correct. That's the correct address.

489
00:38:21.450 --> 00:38:23.540
P3: And yes, it's the same

490
00:38:24.250 --> 00:38:25.760
P3: mailing at home

491
00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:29.070
P3: phone numbers look good.

492
00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:34.649
P3: and then we'll go. Look at the secondary

493
00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:42.189
P3: applying for the caregiver. Yes, and there's the name is correct.

494
00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:46.539
P3: Birthday sign, mail social security

495
00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:51.920
P3: address. Everything looks good, same as the home. Yes.

496
00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:57.090
P3: phone numbers every look, everything looks good. And then we're adding another.

497
00:38:57.870 --> 00:38:59.090
P3: Yes.

498
00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:02.230
P3: everything looks good. Their name.

499
00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:11.440
P3: birthday. Male son, social security number, address and mailing address in the Home is the same

500
00:39:12.210 --> 00:39:15.079
P3: phone numbers and email.

501
00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:18.660
P3: That's it. And then

502
00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:23.869
P3: application and saying that he's the veteran. My husband is the one that's gonna be signing it.

503
00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:32.999
P3: And then we get here. I certified that the individual named in this application involved in my care

504
00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:41.929
P3: and consent to, and I would read this to my husband because he's legally blind. I would read this to him so he'd know exactly what it was he was signing.

505
00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:42.960
Moderator: Okay.

506
00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:53.799
P3: I consent to sharing information necessary to their involvement in my healthcare payment related to such health care or as needed for notification process. And so

507
00:39:54.780 --> 00:40:01.170
P3: right there I would have him sign da da da da. Do I need to sign? Type his name in.

508
00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:06.920
Moderator: Yep, let's go as though you were actually trying to complete the application.

509
00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:12.060
P3: Okay?

510
00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:16.339
P3: And then, of course, you have to. What did I do wrong?

511
00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:20.820
P3: Oh, I didn't fill out his middle name.

512
00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:24.240
P3: Okay?

513
00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:31.220
P3: And then certify. That is correct, Armstead, Joseph Chambers, senior.

514
00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:36.879
P3: Oh, it wants every single dot and tittle. I see

515
00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:42.489
P3: it wanted. It wanted everything.

516
00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:48.810
P3: Okay. So then, of course, checking to ensure that what we just sign is true

517
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:52.000
P3: to the best of our knowledge.

518
00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:53.500
P3: Okay.

519
00:40:54.070 --> 00:40:59.130
P3: And then it wants the all of our signatures. So then.

520
00:41:00.110 --> 00:41:01.650
P3: oh, my goodness!

521
00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:10.869
P3: I think I put my my exact name. I'm not sure

522
00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:13.290
P3: we shall find out.

523
00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:22.619
P3: So far, so good. So that's correct.

524
00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:25.550
P3: So it wants everybody's

525
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:30.989
P3: name and certification, saying that what you just put on there is correct.

526
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:42.000
Moderator: Yeah. And what's your comfort level with filling out and signing this information with all of the without all of those people involved present with you.

527
00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:46.349
P3: For me. I'm very comfortable with it, because they're my sons.

528
00:41:47.082 --> 00:41:49.098
P3: And I'm very

529
00:41:50.496 --> 00:41:55.709
P3: You know, I'm aware all the information that I put in there. I put it in there, and I'm very comfortable with

530
00:41:55.940 --> 00:42:01.150
P3: assigning their names because they've already given me their approval prior to.

531
00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:06.670
P3: So I'm okay with that now. If it was someone else, then I probably would.

532
00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:13.500
P3: If they weren't in front of me, I would probably take a screenshot of what I just did.

533
00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:19.980
P3: and send it to them and have them take a look at it and say, Hey, I need to sign your name here, or I need to

534
00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:25.480
P3: put your name in this spot, and I just wanna make sure that you understand what it is that I'm doing.

535
00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:27.260
P3: So

536
00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:32.429
P3: I think I put his name correct, too.

537
00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:36.920
P3: Yes.

538
00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:45.519
P3: so we've done that. And then I always read the note before I hit that submit.

539
00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:52.030
P3: So, according to the Federal law, there are criminal penalties involved in fine or imprisonment up to 5 years

540
00:42:52.815 --> 00:42:56.559
P3: for withholding information providing incorrect information. So

541
00:42:57.810 --> 00:42:59.610
P3: I don't play with the government.

542
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:04.389
P3: Okay, so that.

543
00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:06.609
Moderator: Since we're in our testing site.

544
00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:07.480
P3: Yes.

545
00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:17.629
Moderator: That's just what it's gonna do. You can stop sharing your screen now. I'm gonna share the next page that would come up if it if we were back inside, and it was working.

546
00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:21.409
P3: So I can close that out. I stopped the share. So I close that.

547
00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:22.100
Moderator: That's perfect.

548
00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:24.370
P3: I don't wanna leave. Stay.

549
00:43:24.370 --> 00:43:28.799
Moderator: And then I'll confirm that you can see it. Okay, I mean it.

550
00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:31.580
Moderator: Well, that's a lot.

551
00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:35.299
Moderator: Can you read the the page that I'm sharing.

552
00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:36.989
P3: Yes, yes, I can.

553
00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:37.830
Moderator: Okay?

554
00:43:39.610 --> 00:43:47.340
Moderator: So could you describe to me in your own words what this page is telling you and what comes next in the process.

555
00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:55.769
P3: Okay, it's basically letting me know that they did receive the application that I just filled out. It was successfully received.

556
00:43:56.270 --> 00:44:00.290
P3: And they should, they'll contact me

557
00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:03.737
P3: and let me know what's happening in the process.

558
00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:11.479
P3: And they want me to print that page. So I'll have you know, proof that this did go through.

559
00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:19.730
P3: So in the event, something comes up and they say, Well, we don't have any application, and by printing that page just shows proof that. Yes.

560
00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:23.880
P3: this is what I have that they did us receive it.

561
00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:30.900
P3: And then it's telling me what to expect. Someone from the care team would reach out to me.

562
00:44:31.830 --> 00:44:33.020
P3: Oh.

563
00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:39.900
P3: like! Can I see who this is? Hang on a second? Let me make sure this is.

564
00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:40.560
Moderator: Bye.

565
00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:41.430
P3: Well, I'm

566
00:44:41.590 --> 00:44:42.520
P3: Hello.

567
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:46.570
P3: Hello!

568
00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:50.109
P3: Okay, that would be a telemarketer.

569
00:44:51.110 --> 00:44:51.450
P3: So

570
00:44:52.490 --> 00:45:01.549
P3: so pretty much just kind of you know, letting me know that that someone would reach out to me once they receive that application, I should expect to hear from someone.

571
00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:04.079
P3: Did I lose my

572
00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:09.272
P3: when I did? When it did that? Did I lose my

573
00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:12.630
P3: I think I did

574
00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:16.990
P3: the share screen I think we lost. Did we.

575
00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:18.759
Moderator: Oh, do you see it still?

576
00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:22.380
Moderator: I'm scrolling through it.

577
00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:26.249
P3: Is it? Which? Which? What is? What is it saying?

578
00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:28.560
Moderator: It says.

579
00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:30.669
P3: I think I lost it.

580
00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:33.700
Moderator: I can. I'll cancel it and share again.

581
00:45:33.970 --> 00:45:35.859
P3: Okay, I think I lost it. Yeah.

582
00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:36.630
Moderator: Pop up!

583
00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:38.989
Moderator: Do you see it now?

584
00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:43.999
P3: Yes, I do. So it's it's it's letting me know that someone's gonna reach out.

585
00:45:44.752 --> 00:45:48.380
P3: The the care team will reach out to me.

586
00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:51.270
P3: and

587
00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:54.510
P3: discuss the application.

588
00:45:56.460 --> 00:46:03.730
P3: See the confirmation. I should receive a confirmation in about 24 h, and make sure I check that junk, mail, and spam.

589
00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:06.890
P3: And if I don't get an email.

590
00:46:06.970 --> 00:46:08.420
P3: they'll reach out.

591
00:46:09.010 --> 00:46:11.060
P3: contact me by phone or mail.

592
00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:14.500
P3: If I have any questions. There's the phone number

593
00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:24.710
P3: and then, if it's denied, that's that's what I got, you know I did hear somebody. And then I received that denial thing there.

594
00:46:25.773 --> 00:46:27.280
P3: So yes.

595
00:46:27.610 --> 00:46:30.569
P3: and then it explains to you what's going on. So.

596
00:46:32.090 --> 00:46:32.560
Moderator: Okay.

597
00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:34.150
P3: That makes sense.

598
00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:37.279
Moderator: Is there anything else that you would have liked to see here.

599
00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:49.829
P3: No, I think it. I think it. It gives enough information. They receive the application.

600
00:46:50.854 --> 00:46:56.240
P3: I should get something in my email pretty much saying we got your application

601
00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:59.170
P3: and that someone will reach out to me

602
00:47:01.850 --> 00:47:04.009
P3: from the caregivers program

603
00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:13.640
P3: and kind of give me a heads up. It's gonna say, either, you know, we did get your information. It's gonna let me know if what I'm applying for was approved or not approved.

604
00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:15.350
P3: And then

605
00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:18.320
P3: kind of go from there. So I think everything.

606
00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:21.340
P3: It it tells everything you need to know. At that point.

607
00:47:22.450 --> 00:47:28.829
Moderator: Okay, thank you so much for that feedback. I'm gonna stop sharing my screen now, and I just have some

608
00:47:28.850 --> 00:47:32.556
Moderator: some couple of wrap up questions for you.

609
00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:38.830
Moderator: so what research would you do before applying and completing a form like this?

610
00:47:39.570 --> 00:47:44.526
P3: I would probably go onto the va.gov and type in

611
00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:46.610
P3: caregivers program

612
00:47:47.629 --> 00:47:53.570
P3: or I would type in caregiver stipend, which is what I did. That's how I started it.

613
00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:59.789
P3: cause I didn't. I didn't even know about the caregivers program prior to the stipend.

614
00:48:00.645 --> 00:48:05.699
P3: I was trying trying to get the stipend and and found out about the caregivers program.

615
00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:16.210
P3: So I would type in caregivers program or a stipend or whatever, and then started doing my research, and from there it led me to the application

616
00:48:17.129 --> 00:48:28.200
P3: and from there I filled it out. And just like I did, there went right through this the process submitted it. Someone did reach out to me actually, pretty quick.

617
00:48:28.753 --> 00:48:39.580
P3: And we went from there. So then, when the denial letter came in. I reached out to them, and that's where they explained to me why it was denied.

618
00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:41.160
P3: And so

619
00:48:41.879 --> 00:48:56.099
P3: yeah, it was. It was pretty pretty simple, and she's like, well, that's just not a denial. You don't. You're not. You're not denied from being a caregiver as part of the program. And then that's when I was able to get into the program. So.

620
00:48:56.340 --> 00:48:56.770
Moderator: Okay.

621
00:48:56.770 --> 00:49:03.070
P3: I thought it was just right. I thought it was just a you know. You denied, that's it. But it wasn't.

622
00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:05.629
P3: It just was dealing with the funds.

623
00:49:06.190 --> 00:49:10.749
Moderator: Okay, did you have to take any additional steps after that, to apply again.

624
00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:11.990
P3: No.

625
00:49:12.450 --> 00:49:16.050
P3: they just explained to me I was part of the general

626
00:49:16.621 --> 00:49:29.700
P3: they they explained to me about the general side of it, and that I I rated being on the general side of it, and they just pretty much just kind of, I guess, transferred me over to that side of it.

627
00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:31.929
P3: and we went from there.

628
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:33.130
Moderator: Okay.

629
00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:34.750
Moderator: gotcha

630
00:49:35.219 --> 00:49:46.219
Moderator: so what were your thoughts about the amount of information that was provided in this form? Did you think it was too much, too little or just enough information.

631
00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:48.980
P3: I think it was enough confirmation.

632
00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:50.420
Moderator: Okay.

633
00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:58.460
Moderator: is there any additional information about who qualifies to be a primary and secondary caregiver that you would like to see in this form.

634
00:49:58.950 --> 00:50:01.610
P3: Excuse me, that is, that's my mom's

635
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:02.580
Moderator: Okay.

636
00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:03.920
P3: Excuse me.

637
00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:05.250
Moderator: Go ahead! Take your time.

638
00:50:05.250 --> 00:50:05.950
P3: Hello.

639
00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:11.199
P3: yes, yes, ma'am.

640
00:50:34.850 --> 00:50:45.139
P3: right? Right? Let me give you my sister's phone number cause that's exactly where she is and she's the one. I think I gave you the number earlier, did I?

641
00:50:46.290 --> 00:50:52.450
P3: Okay, that's Jackie, can you please? Yes, give Jackie a call, because she would be the one that's going to be bringing her.

642
00:50:55.910 --> 00:51:00.719
P3: Well, no, she lives in perilion also. But Pasadena is not that far?

643
00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:04.140
P3: Okay, thank you, Susie.

644
00:51:04.990 --> 00:51:05.900
P3: Bye-bye.

645
00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:08.996
P3: Sorry about that. Thank you.

646
00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:11.780
Moderator: No worries at all. I'm glad you got.

647
00:51:12.170 --> 00:51:14.119
P3: Okay. So where were we?

648
00:51:15.048 --> 00:51:16.482
Moderator: We're almost done actually

649
00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:26.629
Moderator: I was just curious if there was any additional information about who qualifies to be a primary and a secondary caregiver that you would like to see in the form today.

650
00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:35.671
P3: Yeah, I I think it's very

651
00:51:39.290 --> 00:51:44.290
P3: I guess it's it's really almost up to the the primary.

652
00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:49.800
P3: If they're the primary, I think they really need to do their research

653
00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:52.200
P3: before they go

654
00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:56.097
P3: putting second and 3rd people in. Because,

655
00:51:56.670 --> 00:51:59.180
P3: you know, you want to watch out for the veteran.

656
00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:09.740
P3: especially when they're not able to do things for themselves. And you have somebody that steps in. And now they're in control of their funds. And and all these different things.

657
00:52:09.850 --> 00:52:13.860
P3: That's always a little nervous thing for me.

658
00:52:14.050 --> 00:52:18.909
P3: because this veteran could be a person that's got a you know, mental

659
00:52:18.930 --> 00:52:21.130
P3: issues. Ptsd.

660
00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:29.070
P3: my husband's a blind veteran. And so you you gotta they've got to be really trustworthy.

661
00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:36.469
P3: I would almost even say, you know, almost to the point of of putting them in a role of a fiduciary.

662
00:52:36.842 --> 00:52:40.769
P3: Well, I mean, I had to go through it, and I'm his spouse.

663
00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:42.210
P3: So

664
00:52:42.250 --> 00:52:44.840
P3: I thought that was kind of you know.

665
00:52:45.150 --> 00:52:48.030
P3: overboard, but when I looked at it

666
00:52:49.273 --> 00:52:57.959
P3: I thought it was really good, because, you know, not all spouses are spouses. They're spouses, but they're not, you know.

667
00:52:58.853 --> 00:53:05.549
P3: They're not really looking out for the for the veteran, and so I think it's to me

668
00:53:05.580 --> 00:53:07.544
P3: a 3rd and

669
00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:14.579
P3: you know, not the primary, but the second and 3, rd I think they need to be vetted a little bit

670
00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:15.710
P3: better.

671
00:53:16.030 --> 00:53:17.080
P3: Oh.

672
00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:20.189
P3: just to protect that veteran.

673
00:53:20.330 --> 00:53:23.150
P3: that's that's all. That's my opinion.

674
00:53:23.466 --> 00:53:26.430
P3: just just to make sure that they're cared for, because

675
00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:32.543
P3: even with the children you still have some that you know, they're they're children. But

676
00:53:33.220 --> 00:53:34.879
P3: you know they're just not.

677
00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:42.729
P3: They're not doing what they're supposed to do for the veterans. So I think the if if you go that far, it needs to be

678
00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:45.294
P3: a little bit more deeper.

679
00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:46.210
Moderator: Okay.

680
00:53:46.210 --> 00:53:53.749
P3: Make sure they're not a make sure they're not a criminal, and all that kind of stuff, and you know they're not financially taking advantage of the veteran.

681
00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:56.919
Moderator: Okay. And who do you expect to do that vetting.

682
00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:05.024
P3: I guess you know what? That's a good question.

683
00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:11.250
P3: well, I've

684
00:54:11.340 --> 00:54:21.140
P3: since it's something that the Va. Would need, because well, it really would fall back on the person. Because you're the person that's saying, if it's me okay, I'm the primary.

685
00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:26.759
P3: And I'm saying I need to know and trust that this next person that's gonna take my spot

686
00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:35.170
P3: is going to do what I need them to do. So that's my responsibility. That's on me. Because that's that's my family.

687
00:54:35.350 --> 00:54:38.370
P3: So then I think it's up to me.

688
00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:47.350
P3: I would just need to know, okay, where do I need to go? Is there something that they say, Okay, you need to vet this person, and then I click a number. I click up

689
00:54:47.570 --> 00:54:49.119
P3: a window that says.

690
00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:55.220
P3: This is who you contact to get this person vetted, I would need to know how to do it.

691
00:54:56.610 --> 00:54:58.720
P3: So I'll know what I need to do.

692
00:54:59.110 --> 00:55:12.389
P3: Okay. So I mean, if you're gonna I mean, if you if somebody's getting a gun, they won't fingerprints. They want your life history. They want to know, you know, they want to know everything. So I think that's just as important, you know. So

693
00:55:12.830 --> 00:55:19.169
P3: you know. Yes, I would be the responsible person to do it. I just need to know how to go about it.

694
00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:20.190
Moderator: Okay.

695
00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:22.460
Moderator: where would you look for that information?

696
00:55:25.085 --> 00:55:25.900
P3: Up.

697
00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:31.197
P3: I don't know.

698
00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:38.600
P3: I probably would go back to. There's gotta be

699
00:55:39.260 --> 00:55:45.690
P3: Well, I would. I guess I would ask the Va. To give me some assistance in it, like, Hey, the Va. Is like

700
00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:54.290
P3: Do you have? Do you have a way for me? To what is it that you want from me for this for this person

701
00:55:54.520 --> 00:56:04.669
P3: that I'm gonna use as my second and 3, rd to ensure that my this veteran is cared for. So what is the criteria from your policy

702
00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:13.650
P3: that I would need to do this? And if they say, Well, we need this, this and this, and I would say, Well, hey, who do? I need to go to? So I would, I guess, start with the Va.

703
00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:19.449
P3: Because they're the ones that need this information there is protecting their their veteran as well.

704
00:56:20.322 --> 00:56:24.360
P3: So I would need to know where I need to go, you know. Do you want me to go

705
00:56:24.850 --> 00:56:36.269
P3: here. Do you want me to go here and kind of give me some some guidance in it, so I would still go back to the Va. For that. I would do the work. They're gonna make me do the work, because that's what I'm supposed to do.

706
00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:41.709
P3: But I would need some direction. And where should I go to get this information.

707
00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:42.670
Moderator: Okay.

708
00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:46.170
Moderator: thank you. That's really helpful.

709
00:56:46.170 --> 00:56:47.010
P3: You're welcome.

710
00:56:47.729 --> 00:56:59.890
Moderator: Alright. Well, that is all the questions that I had for you today. I just wanna circle back and reconfirm. Are you comfortable? If we were to share a video clip of this session with our Va partners removing any identifying information.

711
00:57:00.370 --> 00:57:01.670
P3: Yes, I'm comfortable.

712
00:57:02.070 --> 00:57:06.069
Moderator: Okay, is there any part of our discussion that you would not want shared in a video clip.

713
00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:07.490
