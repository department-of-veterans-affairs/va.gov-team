00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:08.560
Moderator: Okay, I've started recording. So I'd just like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

2
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.550
P20: Yes.

3
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:19.690
Moderator: And are you comfortable if we decided to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with our Va partners if we removed any information that could be used to identify you.

4
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:20.470
P20: Yes.

5
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.819
Moderator: Okay, thank you so much. So

6
00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:35.250
Moderator: before we take a look at that form I was talking about. Just have a couple of questions for you. Is it accurate that you are not enrolled in the program of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers?

7
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.971
P20: I don't think we are.

8
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.610
P20: I didn't. I'm almost

9
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:47.350
P20: I I think that's the program where it's a family member taking care of you get paid to take care of your Va. Person right.

10
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.580
Moderator: It is associated with a stipend. Yeah.

11
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.590
P20: I'm saying. That's what I'm saying. You could. Yeah, I don't do that.

12
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.270
Moderator: Okay, I.

13
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.840
P20: I don't think, yeah, yeah.

14
00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.589
Moderator: And have you heard of that program? Sounds like you have.

15
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.469
P20: A little. Yeah, a little bit. Yeah, I don't think it fits our. I mean, I don't have the time personally. And yeah.

16
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:05.489
Moderator: Okay.

17
00:01:06.125 --> 00:01:10.749
Moderator: have you ever interacted with the Va for other family member benefits.

18
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:11.810
P20: Oh yes!

19
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.569
Moderator: Okay, such as.

20
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:25.909
P20: Okay. My dad gets incontinence, supplies. It's like pharmaceutical. It's under pharmaceutical. But it's really all incontinence supplies. We visited the Va for just to get approved like medically.

21
00:01:26.244 --> 00:01:30.809
P20: He gets home care. That's a big issue. I wish he would get more hours.

22
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.300
P20: That's something.

23
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.950
P20: that I've spoken to the social worker. We've had to fill out forms and things. Yeah.

24
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.910
Moderator: Okay?

25
00:01:39.865 --> 00:01:45.060
Moderator: So could you tell me in your own words what it means to be a veteran caregiver.

26
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.459
P20: You're saying, not the official program, but how I.

27
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.129
Moderator: Yeah, in the capacity that you operate.

28
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.790
P20: So I don't live with my father, but he's 93, God bless him! But I manage. You know everything.

29
00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:59.479
P20: and

30
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:09.060
P20: I'm extremely appreciative to the Va. Because if it wasn't for the money that he receives from the veterans aid, attendance, and pension.

31
00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:13.529
P20: I would not be able to pay for the 8 that he gets, and he's definitely

32
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:24.529
P20: well, you know, 93. He's definitely the last 2 years has really declined health wise, and he really needs an a 24, 7. I wish we would get more from the home care area. For some reason

33
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:38.570
P20: he he doesn't. He gets, I think, 13Â HA week, and it so between all of that, I have coverage. It's not as much as I'd want, but I'm extremely appreciative, and also for the incontinence supplies, otherwise he would have been in a nursing home by now.

34
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.850
Moderator: Okay.

35
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.790
Moderator: thank you for sharing that.

36
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:42.370
P20: Sure.

37
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.250
Moderator: M.

38
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:54.509
Moderator: How would you want to learn about benefits like the program of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers? How do you like to find out information about things.

39
00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:02.789
P20: I wish. So this is something you're saying in general, and and I happen to be, besides being a child, you know, caregiver person.

40
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:10.089
P20: Just so, you know, professionally, I'm a geriatric care manager. So this touches on me personally and professionally beyond my own dad.

41
00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:24.230
P20: And I really wish that there would have been a better system for informing me about the services he has, because when I originally registered him, I did not know that incontinence supplies were covered, and for years I was paying for them.

42
00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.919
P20: and that really ate into it, and I wish somebody would have like

43
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:37.110
P20: sat with us, and you know, when I registered him, and either I described everything about him, and they said you you would be entitled to these programs or taught it, didn't

44
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.830
P20: it kind of came out

45
00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.890
P20: by happenstance when I went to a professional meeting and heard

46
00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:50.969
P20: that that's a covered experience. Sometimes they have the vas like what you know people do, and just someone talking to care managers. This is for your clients.

47
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.520
P20: I was like, really.

48
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:58.190
P20: And then I looked into it, and the same thing with the home care. Nobody sits you down and says.

49
00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.130
P20: You know this is for you.

50
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.029
Moderator: okay, thank you.

51
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:25.739
P20: Like I I do an assessment when I get on clients personally like that's when people hire me, you know it's private, so I I don't know you have to do the system en masse. That would be cost effective. But sometimes you don't see emails. You don't see text like, Oh, I didn't know about that like, I didn't know about that program that when he passes something's covered, I I saw there was an email. But I'm just saying when you initially register

52
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:35.589
P20: and there should be like a system or an intake like where you click off things. That's what I would suggest, even if it's not a person, it could be.

53
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.410
P20: you know, online.

54
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:46.680
P20: And then when you click these things, then it's like you're eligible. For these programs. Follow up. If you want something like like, I don't even know they exist, and I'm in the know.

55
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:54.189
P20: and it's like, if I didn't know this I can imagine. For years I was paying incontinence. No one ever said, oh, Bella, this is a covered expense.

56
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.089
Moderator: Yeah, okay.

57
00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.299
Moderator: so how have you been figuring that out?

58
00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:22.469
P20: It. It came, you know, every time again, because I do this professionally. That was really, you know I'm not, and again not wearing my daughter hat, but wearing my professional hat. I've gone to meetings, and they had speakers who, from the Va. Or some, you know, or or an allied partner talking about. There's all these different companies that do it, that what? Because a lot of our clients are veterans. So

59
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.529
P20: and then I heard about it. Then I called the bank, go, hey, do you do this? They're like, well, yeah, sure we do.

60
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.730
Moderator: Interesting. Okay.

61
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:31.659
Moderator: thank you for sharing that.

62
00:05:31.977 --> 00:05:42.529
Moderator: If you were completing a form to apply for caregiver benefits like the one we are going to go through today? What information do you think you'd need before completing the form? What would you want to know.

63
00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.259
P20: What would I want to know, or what you want? What I would want to know?

64
00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.619
Moderator: What would you want to know about the program before applying.

65
00:05:53.257 --> 00:05:58.682
P20: Bottom line. What's expected of me? Time? Wise? What's my commitment? What's my requirement?

66
00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:03.490
P20: yeah, mainly that.

67
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:29.059
P20: And I guess the money I mean, like to me. That isn't, you know, again, this isn't as relevant to me, but I'm looking at it wearing that hat. I think somebody would want to know. Bottom line is how much of a time limit, how much money? Because, assuming if you're working, that means giving up your job to do this for some people that might be worth it. And then the qualifications of which family members can do it like, for example, in New York, which I'm very familiar with with Medicaid. They have a program

68
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:44.080
P20: called CD. Pass, and it's something like where a family member can take care of it. Certain family members cannot. A spouse can't do it for a spouse, but a grandchild could. So, in other words, which family members are able to give care how many hours. And what's the pay?

69
00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:46.770
Moderator: Okay, thank you. That's really helpful.

70
00:06:47.336 --> 00:06:54.610
Moderator: So we're not gonna change gears a bit. And I'm gonna share a link to that testing site with you in zoom chat.

71
00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.939
Moderator: Do you see where that is?

72
00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.179
P20: Yeah, just click on it.

73
00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:08.589
Moderator: Okay, perfect. So I'm gonna have you open that in whatever browser you'd like. And then I'm gonna have you share your screen with me in zoom.

74
00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.159
Moderator: Just that screen where the form is open.

75
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:22.939
P20: Okay. I'm on it.

76
00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:31.019
Moderator: Okay, so you wanna go back to the screen window or sorry the zoom window, where you can see me.

77
00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:32.190
P20: Okay.

78
00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:38.919
Moderator: And then there should be a share button on the toolbar on the bottom of the screen. It's a green button that says share?

79
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.880
Moderator: Do you see that.

80
00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:45.530
P20: Yeah.

81
00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:48.649
Moderator: And then it will ask what window you want to share.

82
00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.699
Moderator: Perfect. Thank you so much. I can see it.

83
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:11.569
Moderator: Okay. So I just want you to review this page and tell me your initial thoughts, and what your expectations are of the form. Before going forward and applying.

84
00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:13.200
P20: Okay, give me a second.

85
00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:14.790
Moderator: Take your time.

86
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:29.490
P20: I'm not crazy about the name of the program.

87
00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:31.629
P20: and I don't know if a lot of

88
00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:34.310
P20: I think it could be made a little more

89
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:37.379
P20: comprehensive assistance for family caregivers. I know.

90
00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:42.860
Moderator: What would you change about it?

91
00:08:43.522 --> 00:08:51.279
P20: I was like, you know, you're dealing with all kinds of people of different educational levels, all different English literacy backgrounds.

92
00:08:51.839 --> 00:08:53.999
P20: And every word counts.

93
00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:57.719
P20: I don't know if all those words are necessary just to make it simple

94
00:08:57.999 --> 00:08:59.942
P20: help for fit.

95
00:09:05.239 --> 00:09:31.349
P20: I don't know if I'd like the word comprehensive? Because, like, what does that even mean? What's what's half comprehensive? Why is that word necessary? Again, imagine you're speaking? Go into the lowest denominator when you do these things. So someone who's uneducated and young, let's say, taking care of like I'm dealing with. I'm 58 with a 93 year old father and I have a graduate degree, right? And I'm and I'm very English is my native language. Take it to someone who's let's say

96
00:09:31.709 --> 00:09:45.919
P20: spouse, and they're I don't know. They're under 20 years old, you know. They're not educated, and maybe they don't speak English. Great. And I'd be like, How is that just help for camp family, you know, free help or free Va help

97
00:09:49.409 --> 00:09:55.169
P20: for family, or something like. In other words, I I have to think a little bit more in depth, but

98
00:09:55.549 --> 00:09:59.999
P20: many times, you know, instead of making it as sophisticated, make it as simple.

99
00:10:00.279 --> 00:10:03.039
P20: It's possible for people who

100
00:10:03.309 --> 00:10:05.909
P20: just I just don't see the word.

101
00:10:06.319 --> 00:10:13.062
P20: It's it's sounding like one of these government fancier things that needs to be comprehensive to me means nothing here.

102
00:10:13.549 --> 00:10:16.069
P20: you know, if you want to just say full free help

103
00:10:16.519 --> 00:10:26.609
P20: for fame. I don't know. You need something catchy, you know, and that isn't what I'm saying isn't because I'm not that, you know. I'd have to think it through it. It requires a little more thought, but I'm just not crazy, but that's just me.

104
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.050
Moderator: Yeah, that's really helpful. Thank you.

105
00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:39.450
P20: Do you want me to click on the eligibility or link or no.

106
00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:40.969
P20: just. I'm reading.

107
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:45.149
Moderator: Whatever you would do if you were getting ready to fill out this form.

108
00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:48.389
P20: Okay, so I would be checking on that click on that link. Okay.

109
00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:49.120
Moderator: Okay.

110
00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:00.570
P20: Okay, so do you have time. I should commute through this whole thing, too.

111
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:01.620
P20: if that's.

112
00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:02.630
Moderator: So you can do, yeah.

113
00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:24.509
P20: Yeah, this whole thing program of comprehensive. I don't know. I think there's something set, or even if you came up with like a cute little acronym like help, HELP. Our help program, and HO. 8 for the acronym, or something. I just think it looks a little overwhelming and intimidating where you're trying to help people make it as simple as you can.

114
00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:26.850
P20: Okay, less, less words the better.

115
00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:40.960
P20: This whole thing should be. On the 1st page, you should not have to click the link to get to it.

116
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:44.160
Moderator: Okay.

117
00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:46.910
P20: Too many words.

118
00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:51.619
Moderator: This is too many words.

119
00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:55.860
P20: Again. I'm gonna go back to that other link. But like.

120
00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:58.130
P20: remember how I said, to start with.

121
00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:03.850
P20: there should just be. You shouldn't have to click on the link. One link should not even a link. It should have a bullet.

122
00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:11.319
P20: qualifications. Again, I'm talking off the top of my head qualifications. For

123
00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.319
P20: for family caregiver for the program

124
00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:20.390
P20: boom, 18,

125
00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:23.726
P20: you know like that like 3 bullets 3 to 5 bullets,

126
00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:35.051
P20: your you know family, family, member and friends, spouse, daughter, step, family member extend, you know.

127
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:39.200
P20: an extended family member, I would. I don't know what that means.

128
00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:45.690
P20: Okay, I have no idea. Am IA grandma? What if I'm a daughter in law? Does that count

129
00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:47.639
P20: that should be spelled out.

130
00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:48.440
Moderator: Okay.

131
00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:01.570
P20: You live full time with the Confederate. 24, 7,

132
00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:06.019
P20: and do I have to be available? 24, 7. I would just explain that term?

133
00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:30.060
P20: okay, I'm not gonna click on the link for the active duty, because that's not applicable to me personally.

134
00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:45.309
P20: okay, all of this should be on the main screen. This is very important. I think. You know, I'd have to go back to the main screen. But this is all the information. This is the critical information that I would want to know

135
00:13:45.960 --> 00:14:03.999
P20: who's eligible, what type of people the eligibility of the veteran and then you need links like, if I was doing this, I don't know what it means, the disability rating of 70% or higher. I I would want to link after that because I have no idea my dad is even that.

136
00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:11.900
P20: okay, the next one is self explanatory date of medical discharge.

137
00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:20.499
P20: 6 months of in-person personal care. And again, maybe I'm being too picky.

138
00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:27.000
P20: I don't know if you need to do an ie. What does that mean? Again? I'm in the business as a care manager. This is exactly what I do.

139
00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:31.937
P20: but I don't. What I know that I'm thinking as a regular person.

140
00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:34.449
P20: What would qualify for that.

141
00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:39.690
P20: you know. For example, you know you could say Adls, you know, activities of daily living.

142
00:14:39.720 --> 00:15:00.790
P20: bathing, dressing, grooming, transferring, eating, toileting. Those are typically what's involved. But I would somebody that you know you're looking at people. What kind of people are looking through this? Obviously there are people whose loved ones have gone through a rehab. Stay a hospital stay, or they're injured. But what about if I'm just trying to? Let's say I have a loved one with a chronic condition

143
00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:06.729
P20: who hasn't been in there. But they're constantly. We call Round Robin in and out of the hospital for Chf.

144
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:15.109
P20: diabetes. Things like that. My Dad has wound care he's constantly in. He's done a lot of hospital stays for that. Explain that

145
00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:19.640
P20: for people that aren't familiar with like the what does personal care services mean.

146
00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:20.600
Moderator: Okay.

147
00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:27.579
P20: Would know what that meant. They might just think my dad's lonely. No, you're not going to pay for someone because they're lonely, you know.

148
00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:36.909
P20: Okay? And then, even if you're saying enrolled in Va healthcare, put a link there. So if I'm like, if I want to get enrolled. How do I?

149
00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:41.880
P20: Again? I'm looking at. This is like, I happen to know a lot of these. If you're like new to this.

150
00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:50.090
P20: send me to these places. Okay, fine. What are personal care? See here, you do explain where personal care then link to that, connect it.

151
00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:54.140
P20: Laser, share resolution.

152
00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:11.770
P20: Okay, everyday personal needs. There's something in the industry called activities of daily living that should be the terminology that's used. That's typically what's used when you talk about these things with social workers and doctors.

153
00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:21.109
P20: I'm like, I mean, that's like again, I know Medicaid standards for New York, like, when lawyers were talking about this kind of stuff personal needs. I mean, you can use that term. But

154
00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:23.770
P20: I would do it

155
00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:28.976
P20: every day because people need to understand the terms when they're talking about this

156
00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:32.639
P20: as I'll give you an example. My dad also gets medicaid.

157
00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:56.019
P20: so let's say my question would be, well, can I get both services? Because usually I'm not getting enough hours from here. Can I do this? But they use the term activities of daily living. And that's the tech real time. And then you guys are using personal needs. So I would do, maybe personal needs, slash activities of daily living and list all of them. Again, this is 3. It's typically feeding, bathing, dressing, transferring, grooming, toileting.

158
00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:58.239
P20: Okay, really important.

159
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:08.178
P20: And there's another thing called soft Adls, which are like or the Iadls, they call them

160
00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:31.151
P20: which are like managing your money, shopping, cleaning your house. Right? So are those included. Or is that considered personal needs? I mean, one could say, Yes, right? So that's again connect with the main services that are out there in the world for this type of thing, and see how you compare to that. So Iad, also, you should look into that

161
00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:35.750
P20: safety, protection or instruction in the daily living environment.

162
00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:43.736
P20: Does that mean what you're really just trying to say is, a person has dementia. That's how I would read that again, putting on my professional hat.

163
00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:53.419
P20: and I think if you want to say, this program covers dementia list that as a bullet, because right now that's the biggest challenge that most people. My mother died about a year and a half ago.

164
00:17:53.737 --> 00:17:57.009
P20: And I dealt with that with 10 years with her. So

165
00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.791
P20: would someone with dementia automatically get covered.

166
00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:14.719
P20: that's a huge thing. I don't know if you want to say that it might not be so. But I would address that somewhere, because that's probably one of the biggest things for older veterans, not obviously the young people coming out. No, but older. Yes.

167
00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:15.700
Moderator: Okay.

168
00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:26.560
Moderator: the.

169
00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:31.560
P20: Okay, primary and secondary. I'm not sure what that means till we okay, then it goes. The next thing.

170
00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:44.460
P20: So like, instead of saying, how many can you appoint? Walk me through the program? I don't even know what that means. So I think it should just be like, Okay, so you are entitled to blah blah like, explain that. Then I'll

171
00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:47.320
P20: it's just like putting the cart before the horse.

172
00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.020
P20: Okay.

173
00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:57.529
P20: okay, that sounds nice. So what the benefits

174
00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:14.380
P20: it. It's just very nebulous like. Tell me what the program is. What's the the money people want to know? Very simple, like I said, the bottom line. This all sounds great. But what if you say you're paying $5 an hour?

175
00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:21.430
P20: So I'm like, now I can't give up my $100,000 job or my 50,000 or $25,000 job a year

176
00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:23.130
P20: for $5 an hour.

177
00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:28.639
P20: So I would just explain the stipend and that.

178
00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:46.409
P20: okay, that's fine.

179
00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:01.939
P20: Okay, I'm I'm clicking the apply for you see what I'm doing.

180
00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:04.760
Moderator: Yeah, that's good. I'm just gonna take you back there.

181
00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:05.560
P20: Yeah, yeah.

182
00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:10.799
P20: okay, is this, is this, was this the 1st link? I, yeah.

183
00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:12.739
Moderator: Yeah, this is the 1st link.

184
00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:13.940
P20: Okay. So

185
00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:20.649
P20: I'm going back to where I was because I I wanna, I just click this license. Okay.

186
00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:26.940
P20: this is jumping around a lot. I alright. Okay. So I can do that. I can fly by mail. Fine.

187
00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.979
P20: I comply in person.

188
00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:38.580
P20: Can I call somebody up immediately, as I'm applying to just. I have questions. That's what I want to know, like, right? If I saw this already

189
00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:44.519
P20: before I waste my time not waste, I don't mean to sound disrespectful going through this, I want to know, like.

190
00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.109
P20: okay, this sounds intriguing.

191
00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:57.449
P20: Can you just like person, walk me through this? I'm still it's nebulous to me like, what does it mean? What's the money? What's involved like? There's not enough detail on here.

192
00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:01.519
P20: And there's too many words. It's just I don't know. It's it's not compact.

193
00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:04.020
Moderator: Okay.

194
00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:11.340
Moderator: alright, just for the sake of time I'm gonna have you go back to that original link.

195
00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:12.320
P20: Okay.

196
00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:16.829
P20: right? See here, when it goes. And what if the veteran doesn't apply like? There's so much here that

197
00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:21.330
P20: I think it could be much more compact. Like.

198
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:25.159
P20: say, the the yeah, how do I get back to? Okay, let me get back.

199
00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:32.300
P20: I think what needs to happen is you need to give all the the main issues that people want upfront, and then the links. F like.

200
00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:34.480
P20: you know what I mean it.

201
00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:38.330
P20: It would be more. It, it needs to be more efficiently presented.

202
00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:39.660
Moderator: Okay.

203
00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:48.090
Moderator: So taking a look at this page in particular, does anything stand out to you as being confusing or particularly helpful?

204
00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:09.009
P20: Okay, here, you.

205
00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:16.219
P20: I like that caregiver support line. I would have like a big green or blue or red, white and blue button

206
00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:18.130
P20: somewhere, showing.

207
00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:25.199
P20: you know, in other words, like, you know, like, sometimes when you need help, just call this number when you're on a customer care line, and they give you all these options or just hit 0.

208
00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:33.049
P20: It's like, if I would know, and I had to hit 0. I wouldn't have to hear the lady telling me all these up that should be like A, because most people, I think, are going to want

209
00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:46.939
P20: to talk to somebody. I I would. I don't know about other versus wait like waiting through all this stuff, because you can make it personally to me like in 5Â min I could talk to them, and just say, Give me the bottom line, and to me, and and

210
00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:50.358
P20: not like 15Â min going through all this thing.

211
00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:51.810
Moderator: Okay.

212
00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:52.870
P20: Yeah.

213
00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:55.119
Moderator: So if you're on.

214
00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:56.190
Moderator: I'm sorry.

215
00:22:57.410 --> 00:22:58.130
P20: All right.

216
00:22:59.324 --> 00:23:11.269
Moderator: If you were gonna write this page on a scale of one to 5, 1 being the worst and 5 being the best. How prepared and informed would you feel about the application you're about to begin paste on this page's content.

217
00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:12.920
P20: At 2.

218
00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:15.860
Moderator: Okay. And why would you give it that rating.

219
00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:22.549
P20: Because I still don't know what the program is like. Tell me I'm applying for something that I don't know what I'm applying for.

220
00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:24.580
P20: Like again you told me

221
00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.330
P20: who's eligible

222
00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:29.099
P20: is the caregiver is the the veteran.

223
00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:31.139
P20: How much money you're getting.

224
00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:43.449
P20: and what's the commitment involved? Because I might. It all sounds in theory good. But if I found out that I can't either none of us meet the criteria or it just it doesn't meet our needs. Then

225
00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:48.580
P20: why should I have to wait? Find that out later, like, just tell me from the beginning.

226
00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:51.430
Moderator: Okay, thank you. That's really helpful.

227
00:23:51.862 --> 00:23:55.580
Moderator: So I'd like you to start the form as if you were applying for the program.

228
00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:06.340
Moderator: Okay? And just a reminder. This is a testing site. So you don't have to worry about any of the information that you enter. Going anywhere.

229
00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:11.440
Moderator: You can use real or fake information. It doesn't matter. Whatever's easier for you.

230
00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:14.269
P20: Okay, so I can do fake stuff on.

231
00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:18.739
Moderator: That's fine. I'll give you a fake social security number when we get to that step.

232
00:24:21.775 --> 00:24:26.119
Moderator: Just think aloud as you're going through. I want to hear about any reactions that you're having.

233
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:28.619
P20: Okay, yeah, no, so far.

234
00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:52.709
P20: Oh, what's the social.

235
00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:54.680
Moderator: You can put 3, 2, 1,

236
00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:56.830
Moderator: 4, 5, 6,

237
00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:58.870
Moderator: 7, 8, 9.

238
00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.680
Moderator: Could you tell me why you're pausing on that one?

239
00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:44.220
P20: That's why we ask for this information.

240
00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:46.100
P20: Oh.

241
00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:49.760
P20: okay, I wanna know the county. Okay.

242
00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:10.800
P20: So

243
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:14.250
P20: okay.

244
00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:20.920
P20: So when I'm looking at this, it says that you're gonna mail a copy of their decision to the veteran.

245
00:26:21.805 --> 00:26:24.290
P20: Yeah, I guess that makes sense that

246
00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:29.319
P20: because I'm thinking, what if you're applying for care for someone, and you just 1st want to know if you're eligible. But I guess.

247
00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:31.299
P20: yeah, no, that's okay.

248
00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:04.770
P20: No.

249
00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:17.630
Moderator: How would you prefer to search for a facility here? Is that a city you entered.

250
00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:25.560
P20: So, my dad, we we do. This is true. We do go to the Saint Albans, one. I don't know why it's not okay. So I could just I could put in New York and see what.

251
00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.399
Moderator: Okay. So you didn't see what you expected. There.

252
00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:31.590
P20: Right.

253
00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:45.790
P20: No, I saw the Brooklyn, Va. But it should have said, Let's see if I do. Queens.

254
00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:52.580
P20: Oh, there we go!

255
00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:55.170
P20: So it didn't pull up.

256
00:27:55.350 --> 00:28:03.059
P20: I had to list the county. It didn't when I put in. I guess New York is probably too big. So I had put in, that's okay.

257
00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:08.219
P20: Yeah. It didn't come up right away.

258
00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:09.760
Moderator: Okay.

259
00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:20.820
Moderator: what are your thoughts about this page?

260
00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:43.060
P20: Okay, that makes sense. Because you know what? I actually okay, they caught me because, I just didn't give. I wrote New York, New York and we actually go to the Queens. One. So, okay, so that was my inconsistency. I should have written, I should have given address in queens, so they're they're gearing me back to the main one in Manhattan, so that they caught that that was good.

261
00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:44.310
P20: That's good.

262
00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:48.450
Moderator: Do you think that they are saying that because of the address that you entered.

263
00:28:48.450 --> 00:29:06.160
P20: Right, which is good, because, let's say, I didn't know, you know, because it does make sense to go to the one that's close. I I don't know. Think you have to go to the one closest to you. I don't think it's like a rule, but, like the Manhattan one is definitely bigger than the queens one. So, okay, let me go back to that. Didn't say I have to, because

264
00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:13.281
P20: here, okay, this is the facility we have signed to support you in the application process and has a caregiversible

265
00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:17.820
P20: so the only thing again, I don't do a ton of services at the Va.

266
00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:19.740
P20: Let's say

267
00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:24.009
P20: this is something you have to find out from how the Va. Works that

268
00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:37.530
P20: I think you can go to whichever one you want. I don't think like, for example, again, a lot of states don't have it just New York is so big. So let's say, my dad, this is real life. I'm telling you my dad lives in queens and we go to the local queen. Say.

269
00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:48.350
P20: queens one. It just makes sense. But, for example, he needed like to get something of. I'm not going to probably take him to a doctor. It's too much for him that a certain the doctor we needed was only in Brooklyn.

270
00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:56.760
P20: Could I make Brooklyn my main site? Could I mean in Manhattan, my main site? I don't know if you could like Manhattan's probably the the mama bear of this like I'm sure it's huge.

271
00:29:57.072 --> 00:30:02.239
P20: I've been there. It's it's big. So it's like, Could you do that? And if that is the case.

272
00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:07.659
P20: if that, assuming that is the case that you can pick which one you want, if you have a few in your area.

273
00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:19.299
P20: I think that is, I'm not sure if to verify. But then the question is, can they assign you to a different one to support the application? Is that confusing? Or is it just that's where they're located. Like I'm not

274
00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:21.809
P20: clear you'd you'd have to find that out.

275
00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:32.129
Moderator: Okay, thank you. That's helpful. If you were to rate that process of selecting a facility, one to 5, 1 being the worst 5 being the best. How would you rate that process.

276
00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:45.929
P20: It was like a 3, because it could be. The people know about that like a 3 or 4. Just that. It's because I wrote the wrong address. That wouldn't have come up. But again I think it all comes down to. If they let you pick your facility, then then it's a little

277
00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:54.420
P20: cause. If they do, then it's like, Am I forced? I'd want to go to the facility that I always go to. Why are you sending me to the one just because it's in my address. If I'm willing to go out of my address.

278
00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:54.805
Moderator: Okay.

279
00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:57.250
Moderator: yeah, it's

280
00:30:57.410 --> 00:31:00.940
Moderator: I think it's actually doing that because

281
00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:07.860
Moderator: it's showing you a facility where they have caregiver support. It's not actually because of the address that you entered. I believe so.

282
00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:08.639
P20: Oh, so, maybe.

283
00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:09.240
Moderator: I don't know.

284
00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:09.900
P20: Happen.

285
00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:12.509
Moderator: That's really helpful feedback.

286
00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:23.380
P20: Yeah, maybe they don't all have it. And then what if I physically can't get there like Brooklyn? Let's say if that is the truth, and I have a way to get to Manhattan, not to Brooklyn and disable the veterans ever.

287
00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:29.159
P20: Can it be okay? It's fine. You're signing me to that other one. But can all be done on the phone? Or can I do it in person.

288
00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:32.260
P20: like, I don't know if that's an option.

289
00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:33.200
P20: Yeah, okay.

290
00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.060
Moderator: Really, helpful. Yeah.

291
00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:36.299
P20: Yeah, if it's online, then it doesn't matter.

292
00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:37.470
Moderator: Okay.

293
00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:44.879
Moderator: thank you. Taking a look at this page, what does the term primary caregiver mean to you?

294
00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:48.119
P20: I don't know. It's nebulous.

295
00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:50.780
P20: What it means to me.

296
00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:59.755
P20: Is that someone who's fully responsible? But again, what does that mean? Is it a time commitment? Is it? Is it a responsibility? Level commitment.

297
00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:01.200
Moderator: Okay.

298
00:32:02.490 --> 00:32:05.189
P20: Right. That's why what I was telling you earlier.

299
00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:07.040
P20: Angela is like.

300
00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:15.799
P20: I can't say I want to apply for something. I know what I'm applying for like common sense, right? So that should be laid out from the very beginning, you know.

301
00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:18.109
P20: 8 to 10Â HA day

302
00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:26.709
P20: available in emergencies, and all that, because I could just say, I have a baby, and and I'm not available to do that as much as I, you know, want to. So

303
00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:35.830
P20: would you apply? Okay? So I should click this outside. I'm going to say, yes, that doesn't make sense. How can I say I'm applying for smooth on even. Oh, here, wait, learn more about and see this. Learn more.

304
00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:42.362
P20: Okay, this should be from the 1st page. Okay, but like this is like hidden away little gem here.

305
00:33:01.810 --> 00:33:03.710
P20: I would put next to

306
00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:08.690
P20: significant other. I mean, maybe it's understood a significant other. But in parens

307
00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:14.729
P20: doesn't need to be married, or I don't know. I I guess maybe that's implied because it's a spouse of skip that

308
00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:19.479
P20: friend or neighbor, other relatives. So it sounds like anyone can do this. Basically.

309
00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:21.991
P20: that's what it sounds like.

310
00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:26.679
P20: okay, there. So it sounds like, there really are no qualifications for

311
00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:29.830
P20: a family caregiver.

312
00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:35.230
P20: But they they have to be a relative. But no, it's a friend or neighbor. So it kind of sounds.

313
00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:37.980
P20: Then why are we calling this?

314
00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:42.250
P20: What's this program called again? Is it called family caregiver program, or just caregiver.

315
00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:44.769
Moderator: It. It does have the word family in there.

316
00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:47.640
P20: Okay, so, but it just tells me right here.

317
00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:53.769
P20: 2 of these things don't have to be family. It's friend or neighbor or other relative. What if I have

318
00:33:55.140 --> 00:34:00.159
P20: the oh, this was a question I had. So let's say I'm on, and this is very practical for me.

319
00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:03.780
P20: If if let's say, someone's getting Medicaid.

320
00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:14.229
P20: So it's like an aid from an agency. Could they also qualify to do this program? So I could kind of take advantage of both programs. Cause I could say that aid is my dad's friend

321
00:34:14.968 --> 00:34:19.750
P20: like it doesn't. You don't have to be. There's no family required.

322
00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:20.760
Moderator: Yeah.

323
00:34:22.489 --> 00:34:26.519
P20: Okay. So again, do I want to apply for the program?

324
00:34:26.899 --> 00:34:32.029
P20: I'm gonna say, yes, but I still don't know what the program is and what the qualifications are, and how much I'm getting

325
00:34:32.489 --> 00:34:33.669
P20: so.

326
00:34:33.670 --> 00:34:36.360
Moderator: Yeah, that's really helpful. But let's go through as though you're.

327
00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:40.129
P20: Just to go through like, just to pretend I'm like, yeah, sounds great.

328
00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:49.770
P20: okay. So now, I'm entering the primary family person's information.

329
00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:30.079
P20: I don't know if someone's gonna want to give their birthday when they don't know what they're committed to like. That's just so weird. I again.

330
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:44.039
P20: I would be like. I would have called like many times already this like, if you had that button on the like I'm committing to something. I don't know what you're expecting of me. I know what I'm getting compensated for, and you're already asking for personal information.

331
00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:46.489
P20: My birth date. I I would not be

332
00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:47.820
P20: doing that.

333
00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:48.970
Moderator: Okay.

334
00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:52.219
Moderator: how would you feel about entering the social security number?

335
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:53.800
P20: You gotta be kidding me.

336
00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:59.025
Moderator: Well, if you don't like that.

337
00:35:59.290 --> 00:36:03.240
P20: Yeah, no, I see what that's the next screen. Is that the next screen?

338
00:36:03.859 --> 00:36:05.329
P20: No, no, no.

339
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:28.359
P20: yep, there you go. I would have been like again. How can we? You know it's like the government so funny out of all ends we're talking about scams, scam scams. Don't give out your information. And then here you're asking for information, but I don't even know what I'm committing to. It could be that I would have had I known this 20 screens ago that I'm getting paid $5 an hour, and you expect me to be there 24, 7, and I can't work.

340
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:30.350
P20: I wouldn't even be doing this.

341
00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:31.190
Moderator: Yeah.

342
00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:34.400
P20: So do you want me just put in an or you're gonna tell me a number or.

343
00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:37.640
Moderator: Yeah, we can do a fake one. Let's just do 3, 2, 1,

344
00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:39.730
Moderator: 4, 5, 6,

345
00:36:39.850 --> 00:36:41.410
Moderator: 7, 8, 8.

346
00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:48.120
Moderator: You can keep going.

347
00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:43.860
P20: Do you want me to say yes or no? It doesn't matter the secondary, because it's gonna be the same thing. So so should I just say no to make it faster for time.

348
00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:48.889
Moderator: Yeah, we can do that. But what does a secondary caregiver mean to you?

349
00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:52.400
P20: Oh, yeah, that's a good point. Let's go back. Yeah, I didn't. You're right.

350
00:37:52.690 --> 00:37:56.460
P20: So it's the same people. So again, I'm assuming

351
00:37:58.090 --> 00:38:00.199
P20: there should be some explanation. Again.

352
00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:16.800
P20: I kind of think I know what that means, being in the industry, and also having dealt with what I do professionally, and having cared for my parents. Typically what that means is when I'm not available or I'm incapacitated. That person will take over. But again, someone who has no clue. What does that mean? That should be

353
00:38:17.451 --> 00:38:27.289
P20: again, instead of saying, this is like very gobbly gook. Yes, it's basically the same thing, but it's a backup support. What does explain backup support? Meaning like

354
00:38:27.310 --> 00:38:28.470
P20: that? The

355
00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:30.010
P20: the person?

356
00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:37.809
P20: Are they responsible for the hours for caring? Are they responsible for responsibility? Endpoint, you know like, what does that mean?

357
00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:47.649
Moderator: How do you think that the secondary role differs in the application process and benefits from the primary caregiver.

358
00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:52.992
P20: It. It shouldn't.

359
00:38:53.960 --> 00:39:01.139
P20: I don't. I mean, I don't know if we've completed the whole process. I don't know what the process is. I don't again don't. What are the responsibilities.

360
00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:07.544
P20: you know? Like, let's say I'm Sally, and I'm taking care of my dad, John. But

361
00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:10.239
P20: I don't know. Maybe maybe

362
00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:30.644
P20: I have a child and and I'm not available. I'm taking my kid. I maybe I have a disabled child. I don't know. I'm making up stuff. I have a disabled child. I'm not always available. I have. My husband can take it. Can my husband, who would be the son-in-law, help out, you know to take my dad to a doctor? Can my older child can another sibling of ours do it?

363
00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:36.549
P20: again the responsibility? I don't even know what it means to be, quote unquote. A caregit, you know, like this is.

364
00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:41.370
P20: it's just not explained clearly.

365
00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:42.530
Moderator: Okay.

366
00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:43.740
P20: Yeah.

367
00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:44.740
Moderator: You?

368
00:39:45.239 --> 00:39:52.580
Moderator: Alright. So I also have a question about the sections we've been through so far. If you were completing this form for real.

369
00:39:52.700 --> 00:40:00.189
Moderator: Could you tell me how you'd coordinate getting all of that information from everyone involved? Or would you sit down and complete this form together?

370
00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:12.149
P20: Chances are I'd probably know it again, putting aside, asking for social security number of the secondary people. But all that stuff, if these are people. You know the birth date.

371
00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:16.064
P20: You're not really. There was nothing here that was so

372
00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:24.330
P20: personal. That's strange in terms of documentation. You're asking for demographic info, birth, date.

373
00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:26.580
Moderator: Okay.

374
00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:36.480
P20: I'd also want to know. You know, qualifications like, it's a strange this doesn't make sense on so many levels. Like, for example, if I'm reading this. Okay? And again, I'm

375
00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:48.009
P20: I'm going to keep coming back to this. I'm going for my personal knowledge and professional knowledge. Okay, so let's say, I'm reading this, and this sounds really great. You know, my dad needs help. I'm not working.

376
00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:50.300
P20: Okay. But then

377
00:40:50.340 --> 00:41:02.690
P20: little do I know, because I'm uneducated. I've never, you know. Whatever I'm not informed. My dad is obese. He's 200 pounds. He's a diabetic. I'm a little person like I'm 105 pounds

378
00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:03.535
P20: and

379
00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:06.700
P20: I've never

380
00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:08.659
P20: cared for him before.

381
00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.140
P20: but I want to.

382
00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:12.469
P20: and I have the time.

383
00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:14.559
P20: Will you teach me?

384
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:22.069
P20: Am I even capable of caring for him like, what are you doing? An assessment process to determine

385
00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:23.970
P20: that I can do it?

386
00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:28.650
P20: What's your checks and balances on me?

387
00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:48.220
P20: Are you paying me? How do you know I'm even doing it? Are you sending a nurse like? Typically, again, the way these things work professionally like there's a program new card CD pass, and they actually say, like, you have to meet criteria initially. But there really isn't so much people checking, and there could be tremendous fraud on this.

388
00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:53.559
P20: So what if I say, my grandson's gonna help my dad or my son?

389
00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:59.530
P20: And we filled out all the Va stuff. But really, yeah, my dad's managing on his own. And we're just

390
00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:01.940
P20: taking the checks. How do you know?

391
00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:06.279
P20: Is someone visiting quarterly, or you know who's supervising this program?

392
00:42:06.450 --> 00:42:11.310
P20: I'm saying that more professionally like how there should be some types of something.

393
00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:18.300
P20: what if you need increased care? What is the care amount based on? Like? Again? We don't know how many hours. And what's the pay?

394
00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:23.450
P20: Is this everyone a standard? Is there like? How does this even work? I still have no clue.

395
00:42:23.790 --> 00:42:29.189
P20: I wouldn't even be applying birth date, social statement. I don't even know what we're getting or what this is about.

396
00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:31.550
P20: I just keep coming back to that.

397
00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:33.149
P20: Okay, yeah.

398
00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:34.030
Moderator: It's really fair.

399
00:42:34.439 --> 00:42:39.939
Moderator: So this page here, in your own words, could you describe what it's asking you and what it means?

400
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:42.019
P20: Okay, next steps, you can see.

401
00:42:55.800 --> 00:43:06.770
P20: Okay, I mean, I know what it is. They're basically asking if the person has cognitive ability to sign, or if not, or physical ability, or you can sign for them. So this gets down to power of attorney.

402
00:43:07.367 --> 00:43:10.049
P20: Yeah, but that's what that means.

403
00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:13.999
Moderator: Okay. Are you a legal representative for the veteran.

404
00:43:14.290 --> 00:43:15.540
P20: Me personally.

405
00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:16.980
P20: Yes.

406
00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:21.070
Moderator: Okay. So what would you select here?

407
00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:23.269
P20: The 1st one.

408
00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:28.350
Moderator: The 1st one.

409
00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:35.589
P20: I am valid power of attorney. I also feel we also did the Va. Because they didn't recognize you like they also have their own.

410
00:43:36.199 --> 00:43:45.479
P20: I I could be, either, because I feel both. But but it's the 1st one listed, and that's usually like the most people's heads. When you have a poa.

411
00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:47.830
P20: There's the Va form. But

412
00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:49.980
P20: in the world at large, you know. Again

413
00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:52.710
P20: I would I would have checked the poa.

414
00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:54.410
Moderator: Okay.

415
00:43:54.410 --> 00:44:00.660
P20: I'm also his Vegans claimant represent. I'm like, I think, 3 of these things here, but that's you know. I don't know if everyone has that.

416
00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:06.050
Moderator: oh!

417
00:44:12.730 --> 00:44:14.260
P20: Okay, yeah, that's all fine.

418
00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:25.120
Moderator: Okay? And then what type of document would you upload here.

419
00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:30.709
P20: Again. It could probably be the poa.

420
00:44:31.130 --> 00:44:33.269
P20: But, like I said, I'm also

421
00:44:34.859 --> 00:44:43.220
P20: I'm not sure which. If it's the I don't either another one or 2 of these. I don't know if it's on the signer certificate. No, no, I'm not. If I'm

422
00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:54.820
P20: and I'm also I'm definitely his claimants representative. I'm also his fiduciary. But yeah.

423
00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:58.399
P20: alright, yeah. I mean, I could upload that. That wouldn't be a problem.

424
00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:00.659
P20: I'm not gonna do that. But I could.

425
00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:05.680
Moderator: Yeah, that's fine. What would you expect to happen next if you did upload the poa.

426
00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:19.889
P20: I'd like. I still don't know what the program is like. You know how many hours, what I'm getting paid? How are we signing up for something we don't know. So somewhere I'm I'm waiting to say, what is this program?

427
00:45:20.490 --> 00:45:29.950
Moderator: Okay. Let's go back a page and then just select that you're the veteran signing for yourself so that we can bypass this upload file step.

428
00:45:31.028 --> 00:45:35.770
Moderator: If you go down to the button where that and you was. There's a back button, too.

429
00:45:35.770 --> 00:45:38.309
P20: Oh, I think I did. I think I did. Okay, here.

430
00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:41.140
Moderator: Yeah, let's perfect.

431
00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:43.220
P20: Oh!

432
00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:46.630
Moderator: So just take a look over this page and tell me what you think about it.

433
00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:50.500
P20: I should click on the things.

434
00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:52.580
Moderator: If that's what you would do.

435
00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:55.430
P20: Well, I don't know time wise if you like. The veterans incur.

436
00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:57.930
P20: Okay, so the 1st thing

437
00:45:58.770 --> 00:46:01.089
P20: I mean something is just.

438
00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:07.710
P20: oh, okay, this is just giving a summary of what I put in. I still don't know what the program is.

439
00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:10.120
P20: This is like this whole. It doesn't.

440
00:46:15.110 --> 00:46:16.900
P20: Oh, wait! Is that going to my demo?

441
00:46:22.010 --> 00:46:27.129
P20: So all that thing all this is doing is just it's a review. It's just spinning back everything I wrote.

442
00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:29.079
P20: I don't know the program

443
00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:36.269
P20: at this point. I probably I mean, I would have stopped ages ago and called, you guys, how am I certified? This doesn't make sense.

444
00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:41.250
P20: I started with individual names like more involved in my care. And I

445
00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:45.920
P20: you can't

446
00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:50.330
P20: certified to something. You don't know what you're certifying to.

447
00:46:50.590 --> 00:46:53.209
P20: What type of care. I don't know.

448
00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:55.440
P20: That doesn't make sense.

449
00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:10.239
Moderator: What would your comfort level be with S, filling these out without all the people involved present.

450
00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:14.330
P20: Meaning. If I was the

451
00:47:14.970 --> 00:47:18.479
P20: which role, if I was the vet like, who? What do you mean?

452
00:47:18.990 --> 00:47:21.249
Moderator: You would be the primary caregiver.

453
00:47:21.250 --> 00:47:23.290
P20: Right? Oh, without the secondary people.

454
00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:24.879
Moderator: For your dad here.

455
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:29.689
P20: Yeah, no, that's why I always I might do everything for him. He can't do himself. So that's fine.

456
00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:40.079
P20: and it's fine for the secondary, because, assuming I'm the main cookie, I'm arranging all of this. I'm the main person. So that you know this is what this is. Typically how caregiving functions.

457
00:47:40.890 --> 00:47:41.570
Moderator: Okay.

458
00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:47.729
Moderator: If you saw something that you entered by mistake, how would you go about correcting that.

459
00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:51.100
P20: Oh! In the review.

460
00:47:53.353 --> 00:47:55.269
P20: Only the the edit button.

461
00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:00.979
Moderator: Okay, go ahead and try that.

462
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:02.850
P20: Oh, just to edit something. Okay?

463
00:48:02.850 --> 00:48:04.300
Moderator: Yeah, for anything.

464
00:48:14.430 --> 00:48:16.459
P20: Okay. Here. Also, I put them along, though.

465
00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:19.500
P20: Yeah, that's fine.

466
00:48:26.310 --> 00:48:34.119
Moderator: Okay, any other feedback about this page, you won't be able to actually submit the form. It would just give you an error. So I'm gonna share the final page.

467
00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:36.029
P20: Right? Okay? So I'm just reading

468
00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:53.549
P20: again. It doesn't make sense. This 3rd paragraph. I tested my application into our participation. Okay, now we're calling it Pcafc.

469
00:48:53.950 --> 00:49:02.139
P20: That's the 1st time I'm seeing this acronym again. It should be. Do a nice little acronym like help, or something that sounds

470
00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:03.869
P20: like, you know whatever

471
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:06.029
P20: is this?

472
00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:12.859
P20: And again again, I can't

473
00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:20.589
P20: say attest to my all of that when I don't know what that means. Okay, so it keeps going back to that.

474
00:49:25.070 --> 00:49:28.290
P20: I agree to perform personal care services again.

475
00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:31.230
P20: These things have to be clarified

476
00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:44.599
P20: when it says it can be revoked by 38 Cfr. Whatever. What does that mean?

477
00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:47.110
P20: Why could I be revoked?

478
00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:52.690
P20: Keep in mind. People might be changing their life around for this, you know, I might be quitting a job or

479
00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:56.190
P20: taking a babysitter to pay for my kid to do like

480
00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:58.130
P20: this is not?

481
00:49:58.250 --> 00:50:02.778
P20: There's too much attention to the gobbledygook details, and not like, what is this about.

482
00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:04.700
Moderator: Okay.

483
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:06.700
P20: Yeah.

484
00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:14.519
P20: yeah. Okay. What do you? What do you want me to do? Submit, or don't do I hit that or.

485
00:50:15.013 --> 00:50:17.692
Moderator: No, it will just give you an error. If you do

486
00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:23.760
Moderator: go ahead. Hit, submit. I'll show you what will come next, and I just want to get your feedback on this page.

487
00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:27.299
Moderator: We're right at time, though, so do you have a hard stop.

488
00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:29.570
P20: No, it's okay. Keep going.

489
00:50:29.570 --> 00:50:31.660
Moderator: Okay, we're almost towards the end here.

490
00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:35.440
Moderator: Can you see the page? Okay.

491
00:50:35.590 --> 00:50:36.180
P20: Yep.

492
00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:38.390
Moderator: Okay. So I'm just gonna

493
00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:48.520
Moderator: scroll through this page. You can tell me if you want me to scroll faster or slower, and just describe to me on in your own words what the page is telling you, and what comes next in the process.

494
00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:53.269
P20: This whole thing doesn't make sense. I still don't know what I'm applying for.

495
00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:58.469
P20: I've never seen a program that is, you know. So right away. Thank you for completing.

496
00:50:58.970 --> 00:51:09.159
P20: I don't know what the qualifications were for the program. I don't know if I meet the criteria. I don't know what it needs to be done. I don't know how I'm being compensated, what my responsibility is.

497
00:51:09.550 --> 00:51:16.750
P20: so it doesn't. None of that is clear. I don't know what the supervision is for me, or what if I need education? Nothing

498
00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:18.820
P20: of? Who am I reporting to?

499
00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:22.140
P20: So this whole thing is just very superficial.

500
00:51:22.810 --> 00:51:32.690
P20: Okay, member of the caregiver support team. Where the veteran receives care plans or receive care will contact the veteran and any caregivers this application eligibility that doesn't even make sense.

501
00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:36.379
P20: So I apply. Then they're gonna call and explain it to me.

502
00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:40.760
Moderator: Is that what you think is telling you.

503
00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:50.950
P20: Yeah, it says, a member of the caregiver support team where the veteran receives care or plans to receive care will contact the veteran and any caregivers to discuss this application eligibility.

504
00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:58.330
P20: So that means I'm applying. I might not even be eligible. So basically this, this, the whole thing, doesn't even make sense. It seems like

505
00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:04.330
P20: what to do if you have questions now. But like, yeah.

506
00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:10.009
P20: okay, tells you, if you get denied

507
00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:13.310
P20: here, learn more about the family caregiver program.

508
00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:18.519
P20: Oh, decision! Tell me what the program is. This is just really frustrating.

509
00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:24.269
P20: You may also be available for the program of General caregiver support service like what

510
00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:47.520
P20: this is such gobbledygook like. Whoever did this. I hope this isn't you guys. I know you're you're the research people. But like this, whoever did this. I think it's wonderful that the Va. Is trying to make such a program. I laud the concept. It is very poorly executed. Forget the language, just the concept, very poorly, poorly, poorly executed. It's a waste of time for

511
00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:59.540
P20: the family members, the veteran and the professionals from the Va. Who could be helping people where this should be explained very simply. It should not be so complicated to explain this

512
00:52:59.890 --> 00:53:03.119
P20: that I should only be calling. If I'm really eligible.

513
00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:10.310
P20: I could have spent so much time in finding my dad the veterans on eligible. I'm not eligible, or I don't want it, because

514
00:53:10.330 --> 00:53:13.219
P20: the terms aren't satisfactory to me.

515
00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:18.070
P20: So it's like I still don't even know anything. It sounds kind of crazy.

516
00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:27.510
P20: Read about the program of general character support. Maybe if I would have clicked on that that would have totally yeah, just I don't know.

517
00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:32.050
P20: I keep coming back to the same stuff because it's just so basic.

518
00:53:35.790 --> 00:53:44.950
P20: Unless there's an assumption that you know what the program is I'm assuming it's not like. If I already knew what the program was, and that was like a whole set, and this whole session was about

519
00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:51.120
P20: the details of it and the execution. But I don't even know substantively what it is.

520
00:53:55.610 --> 00:53:57.960
Moderator: okay, any other feedback about this page.

521
00:53:58.180 --> 00:53:58.940
P20: No.

522
00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:00.949
P20: it just doesn't make sense.

523
00:54:01.230 --> 00:54:04.700
Moderator: Okay, I just have a couple of final questions, and then we're all done.

524
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:10.390
Moderator: So now that you've seen the form, what research would you want to do before applying.

525
00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:19.740
P20: Again back to the basics. I want to know what is the program. What are the qualifications for the veteran, for the caregiver?

526
00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:21.517
P20: What type of

527
00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:28.740
P20: remuneration is the the caregiver receiving what are the expectations, the time commitment, the money

528
00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:29.630
P20: and

529
00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:42.299
P20: and what is the supervision or training? You know what if somebody says I want to do this, but I don't know. My dad's just getting out of the hospital, or you know, my boyfriend or husband whatever, and he's disabled. He lost his leg.

530
00:54:42.450 --> 00:54:47.320
P20: I've never done that before, that's scary. But I I want to do it. Are you gonna train me.

531
00:54:47.790 --> 00:54:48.370
Moderator: Hmm.

532
00:54:48.370 --> 00:54:50.050
P20: And then what's the supervision?

533
00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:56.840
P20: Who can I talk to for questions? If I have about things like, who's doing that? All that.

534
00:54:57.350 --> 00:54:58.130
Moderator: Okay.

535
00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:02.509
Moderator: And where? Where would you find? Where would you look for that information?

536
00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:11.909
P20: I, why wouldn't go online? I would be calling the either the appointed caregiver person or my social like we have. I. My dad is a social worker in the Va. So I would be calling

537
00:55:11.930 --> 00:55:21.909
P20: that person, or whoever is the caregiver coordinator for this program, like, remember, they said they assigned somebody that I would have gone to. I'm sure they would have given me a number. It would have been a phone call, not

538
00:55:22.250 --> 00:55:28.500
P20: I wouldn't. Yeah. I want to pertain to me, not just online. So I would want to speak to someone.

539
00:55:28.850 --> 00:55:40.769
Moderator: Okay, thank you. That's helpful. I think I know the answer to this question. But what are your thoughts about the amount of information provided in this form. Did you think it was too much just enough, or too little.

540
00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:42.730
P20: Too much.

541
00:55:44.110 --> 00:55:46.920
Moderator: Too much and not the right information right? Correct.

542
00:55:46.920 --> 00:56:00.089
P20: Again. Tell, tell me what the program is. Once I know we qualify, I'm happy to give even social and everything. But you don't ask for information. It doesn't make sense to ask for information. I don't know what I'm applying for.

543
00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:01.560
Moderator: Okay.

544
00:56:02.438 --> 00:56:13.600
Moderator: Is there anything that would have been helpful to see about? Who any additional information that would have been helpful to see about who qualifies to be a primary or secondary caregiver in this form.

545
00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:31.209
P20: Yes, I think I've said that extensively, and that should be on the 1st page, and should be very clearly laid out, that who qualifies as the vet who qualifies for the caregiver. I said this many times, and what are their responsibilities, and what is their remuneration and expectations?

546
00:56:31.790 --> 00:56:32.450
Moderator: Okay.

547
00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:45.070
Moderator: thank you so much. That is all the questions I had for you. I just want to circle back and reconfirm. Are you comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our Va. Partners removing any identifying information.

548
00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:49.569
P20: Yes, of course, I hope this clarifies. I think it's a cool program, but

549
00:56:50.050 --> 00:56:52.639
P20: you know, I hope my info helps.

550
00:56:52.780 --> 00:56:54.059
Moderator: Yeah. That's why we're doing it.

551
00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:54.586
P20: So, yeah.

552
00:56:55.110 --> 00:56:57.422
Moderator: So it's really helpful.

553
00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:02.199
Moderator: is there any part of our discussion that you wouldn't want shared in a video clip?

554
00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:03.170
P20: No.

555
00:57:03.730 --> 00:57:13.639
Moderator: Okay, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us. The feedback is really helpful and will directly impact changes. We'll make to this process for veterans and caregivers.

556
00:57:13.790 --> 00:57:28.590
Moderator: Lastly, Perigan, that's the company that sent you the invite for this. They'll be sending you a thank you. Note in your email with a blurb that you could pass along. If you know any other veterans or caregivers that might want to participate in research studies like this.

557
00:57:28.830 --> 00:57:33.750
P20: Okay, wonderful. Thank you. Yeah. And if they have any further questions for follow up, I'm here. Thank you.

558
00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:38.840
Moderator: Thank you so much. We really appreciate it, and I hope you have a great rest of your day and a good weekend.

559
00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:41.520
P20: You, too. Thank you. You guys are doing great work. Thank you.

560
00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:42.510
Moderator: Thank you.

561
00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:44.300
P20: Alright! Take care! Bye-bye.
