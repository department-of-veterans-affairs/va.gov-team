P27: Zoom Meeting

2
00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:03.960
P27: zoom us has new window.

3
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:05.880
Moderator: Interesting.

4
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.045
Moderator: Okay?

5
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:14.459
Moderator: So I I started recording, I'd just like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

6
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:15.410
P27: Yes.

7
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:22.499
Moderator: And is it okay with you? If we decided to use a recorded clip from our session today removing any identifying information.

8
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:23.530
P27: Yes.

9
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.768
Moderator: Okay, thank you so much.

10
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:43.809
Moderator: So before we go to that form, I just have a few questions about your veteran caregiver application experience. So have you ever applied for the program of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers?

11
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:44.780
P27: No.

12
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.969
Moderator: Okay. Have you heard of that program before.

13
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.120
P27: Oh yes!

14
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.249
Moderator: Okay. What do you know about it?

15
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.619
P27: Well, when it initially came out that it was post 9, 11 guys.

16
00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.929
P27: And then it was followed through by the 1975. And prior.

17
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.660
P27: and that's when everything blew up and went extremely broken.

18
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:15.269
P27: And that's when I threw everybody out, and I am a board Officer National Board officer for the Blinded Veterans Association.

19
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.590
P27: and I have presented to Congress personally on the issues that affect it, and

20
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.609
P27: how they did not have

21
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.370
P27: adls

22
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.210
P27: for blind people.

23
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.779
P27: They had adls, so that if you could

24
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.310
P27: feed yourself

25
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:48.930
P27: or not feed yourself, you would qualify, and everything. If you could not put your shoes on, you would qualify. And things like that, those types of Adls, the problem being that blind folks can feed themselves. They just can't see

26
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.309
P27: if the food they're trying to eat is cooked.

27
00:01:51.390 --> 00:02:01.340
P27: They can't see if they're putting on shoes of the same color. They can't, you know they can't. I cut myself quite often. I can't tell that I'm bleeding because I don't see it.

28
00:02:01.868 --> 00:02:07.771
P27: I don't feel it sometimes. And things like that. So we did go to Congress.

29
00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.810
P27: we got with the Va. And we presented Adls. And currently

30
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.039
P27: awaiting signature at this point in time

31
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.000
P27: is the new

32
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.140
P27: newly revised program, and for the blind, it will have the

33
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.869
P27: Adls, the standards being less than a 5 degree field of view.

34
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.420
P27: worse than 5, 200 vision acuity

35
00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.184
P27: to qualify for the blind.

36
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:43.139
P27: so that way there we can get that going. And just for an fyi on your end

37
00:02:43.554 --> 00:02:51.049
P27: we did along with, I think it's 15 or 16 other veteran service organizations. Send a letter to President Biden

38
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.039
P27: saying, Okay, all this is in place. It's only awaiting your signature.

39
00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.959
P27: What's what's hold? What's the holdup? Why are we not getting this done? We have. We have people that are certainly

40
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.880
P27: could benefit from this program.

41
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.850
P27: so

42
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.217
P27: may may have given you more than you might have known right there.

43
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.019
Moderator: That's really helpful. Thank you. I appreciate you sharing that. And I'm sorry that

44
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.159
Moderator: that sounds extremely frustrating.

45
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.650
P27: Yeah, yeah, it's a

46
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.300
P27: certainly not your fault, like, I say, it's just, you know.

47
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.809
P27: we'll just put out a

48
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.599
P27: a program that was

49
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.610
P27: well intended, but poorly implemented.

50
00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.630
Moderator: Gotcha.

51
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.050
Moderator: Okay? Boom.

52
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.370
P27: I'm gonna do one thing real quick before we go any further.

53
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.560
Moderator: Sure. Go ahead!

54
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.159
P27: I know turn on, do not disturb.

55
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.679
P27: Okay. I turned it up.

56
00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.370
P27: Now you'll find Ann.

57
00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:52.449
P27: because I know I'm gonna have about a thousand phone calls here in a little while focus do not disturb on. So, okay.

58
00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.160
Moderator: hmm!

59
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.500
Moderator: Sorry. One of my observers seems like he can't hear.

60
00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.480
Moderator: I apologize if they have to leave and come back. I know you're screaming.

61
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.660
P27: That.

62
00:04:16.516 --> 00:04:21.020
Moderator: So have you ever interacted with the Va. For other family member benefits.

63
00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.009
P27: no, simply because my wife is also a veteran

64
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.430
P27: and

65
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.249
P27: trying to think the only thing I did was on my benefits was to make sure that I was

66
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.600
P27: identified as married versus single

67
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:53.490
P27: And that's really about it, because she's again. She's a veteran, so she's authorized, entitled to her own benefits and everything. So that's a little tough. But I do help veterans try to do that

68
00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:02.970
P27: because I am a veteran service officer. So I'm working with veterans all time trying to get them their benefits and get those things going.

69
00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.720
P27: I do know that with 8 attendance and the Pcafc.

70
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.140
P27: All of those issues there.

71
00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.090
P27: They seem to be going through Vha

72
00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.270
P27: versus the Vba.

73
00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.199
P27: And unless you have a very tight, close

74
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.220
P27: relationship with the people on the Vha. Side of the house.

75
00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.669
P27: They won't even talk to us.

76
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:32.470
P27: Okay, they'll simply tell you point blank. You were with veterans, benefits

77
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.289
P27: your veteran, all veteran service offices of veterans, health.

78
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.119
P27: and we have literally helped veterans fill out, for example, their aid attendance

79
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:43.480
P27: sheet.

80
00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:52.790
P27: you know, download it, fill it out and everything. They bring it over there, and they literally have furnace and trash and pulled out the exact same form and filled it out exactly the same.

81
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.430
P27: So there's a disparity between

82
00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:07.360
P27: the Vha and Vba as far as who can do what and how they want to help and assist. So there are those roadblocks there, and a lot of it has to revolve around hipaa.

83
00:06:08.171 --> 00:06:14.608
P27: and the misinterpretation and understanding of what hipaa is and what it does, and why it does what it does

84
00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:17.260
P27: the Vha will. Typically.

85
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:22.240
P27: if you say anything other than you know.

86
00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:30.490
P27: the sky is blue, everything else is a hipaa violation in some cases, and it's really bad. I mean to the point. They weren't even acknowledging

87
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.230
P27: and acknowledge

88
00:06:32.562 --> 00:06:40.069
P27: that they work in the Va health care system, you know. It. It truly can get that bad with some individuals. That's how

89
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.750
P27: how bad they've been beating. Been beaten over the head with this hipaa stuff.

90
00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:47.164
P27: and again it has its place

91
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:58.027
P27: discussing with Vha that I'm sending a veteran over for aid and attendance, and he has this form, and we filled it out, etc, etc. That is not a hipaa violation.

92
00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:02.340
P27: so there is that issue there again. That doesn't really affect

93
00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:07.000
P27: this specific thing we're doing today. But that is some something that does have.

94
00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:10.180
P27: It is an issue. So.

95
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:14.770
Moderator: Yeah, thank you. I'm gonna let our one person back in.

96
00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:16.540
P27: He has joined the meeting. Sure.

97
00:07:17.645 --> 00:07:18.350
Moderator: Okay.

98
00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:28.760
Moderator: alright. Well, thank you so much for that. Could you explain to me in your own words what it means to you to have a caregiver.

99
00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:33.060
P27: Yeah, my wife is my caregiver.

100
00:07:33.438 --> 00:07:39.810
P27: I will tell you that. She's the one that make sure that my pill boxes are filled correctly

101
00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.019
P27: that I'm dressed

102
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:48.469
P27: correctly. I mean, I walk around unbutton shirt button wrong things like that. I

103
00:07:48.870 --> 00:08:03.800
P27: I have. My color vision is absolutely horrible, so I may mix and match things. She she makes sure like when I'm cooking, cause I do most of the cooking in my house. But she will come up, and I will have to, you know, when, if I'm cooking something. Okay.

104
00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:11.689
P27: check with their honor. But sometimes you gotta see, you know, is this piece of steak done medium rare, so she'll have to come and check that kind of stuff

105
00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:36.929
P27: like. I say, the pillbox is the biggest thing she just told me a little while ago you missed a pill must have fell out of my hand, or whatever I don't know which pill it is. How important it is. So you know, that's what I really try for, and I make sure that when I'm doing my pills I don't do them over the sink. I do them over the counter. Here, put them in my hand, make sure that I have them in my hand, and if I do drop them. If I don't hear it.

106
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:42.859
P27: It's there where she can see it. And say, you you missed this pill here, you know.

107
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:55.080
P27: Just things like that sighted guide all sorts of stuff, I mean, it's just immense. I would be totally lost without her. And she just left here a little while ago, going to Texas, and

108
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.959
P27: you know, prior to her leaving, she just

109
00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:08.750
P27: made sure that the meals that I wanted to cook while she's gone are there in the sink defrosting. So I know what I'm gonna have. I have my menus planned out while she's gone.

110
00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:18.939
P27: and that kind of thing, because otherwise I don't know what I'm grabbing. Sometimes there's the certain devices that will help, and I'm starting to use more and more of them as they become more and more available and.

111
00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:19.750
Gaspare C: Move forward!

112
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:20.560
P27: But that's.

113
00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:20.970
Gaspare C: Kind of.

114
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:22.030
P27: That

115
00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:22.986
P27: she will

116
00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.970
P27: as a caregiver, provide for me.

117
00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:29.910
Moderator: Thank you so much. Gaspar, can you hear.

118
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:32.930
Gaspare C: Yes. Can you hear me? Okay.

119
00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:35.340
Gaspare C: Yep, thank you guys for your patience.

120
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.510
Moderator: Thank you.

121
00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.105
Moderator: Alright.

122
00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:50.680
Moderator: so how do you like to learn about these kind of benefits like the caregiver program that your family members may qualify. For what kind of sources do you use.

123
00:09:51.601 --> 00:09:53.758
P27: I'm gonna screw this up.

124
00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:57.749
P27: There's a Va email. I get the Va

125
00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:06.979
P27: emails that come out. I'm gonna say, weekly. And that's 1 of the largest sources that I get, because it has a synopsis of multiple things that happen every week.

126
00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:13.110
P27: In turn. The Bva takes items of significance like this.

127
00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:18.050
P27: and we put it in our weekly Bva happenings to get it out that way. There.

128
00:10:18.588 --> 00:10:33.819
P27: Sometimes sometimes it's missed, and I hear about it because I volunteer at the Va. At the blind rehab center, and I hear about it that way sometimes it's other veterans coming up and saying, What about this, and then actually going out and researching it to find it that way.

129
00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:42.520
P27: that's typically how I hear about it different things like that in in that order right there.

130
00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:43.890
P27: Oh.

131
00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:45.930
P27: and everything.

132
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:59.680
Moderator: Okay, thank you. That's helpful. If you were completing a form to apply for caregiver benefits like the one we're gonna go through today. What information do you think you would want to know before going ahead and completing that.

133
00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:07.879
P27: Well, of course. Yeah, I'm I'm speaking to you from a Vso point of view, along with a personal point of view.

134
00:11:08.495 --> 00:11:10.310
P27: The personal information

135
00:11:10.981 --> 00:11:14.770
P27: name address, phone number, contact information

136
00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.879
P27: benefits rating

137
00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:19.545
P27: where they're at currently

138
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:23.140
P27: and

139
00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:26.720
P27: a a breakdown

140
00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:27.983
P27: or a

141
00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.170
P27: link

142
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:32.740
P27: to an easy to read

143
00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:33.790
P27: it

144
00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:37.510
P27: easy to follow list of Adls

145
00:11:38.993 --> 00:11:44.439
P27: what they are and how they would apply. Okay, if you don't meet these requirements.

146
00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:46.460
P27: then you wouldn't be qualified.

147
00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.780
P27: and I'll give you a good example

148
00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:53.990
P27: on this is when it when this program very 1st came out, way back for the post 9 11.

149
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:59.080
P27: Unfortunately, I sadly talk to people that literally were getting it for Tinnitus.

150
00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:01.569
P27: Are you kidding me.

151
00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:14.009
P27: you know, but they were getting it, and that's where the system was truly broken. That was the implement implementation process. So it has to really have a clarity on the Adls, and possibly even breaking down to

152
00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:18.369
P27: what they are and and where it would be identified, for example.

153
00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:19.510
P27: in the

154
00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:23.979
P27: for blindness, for visual acuity, or

155
00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:25.220
P27: from

156
00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.480
P27: field of view.

157
00:12:28.033 --> 00:12:45.259
P27: Where you know a doctor's exam stating, you know, it would have to be there. You just can't say I've got a 5 degree field of view. It's got to be notated there and have people understand that that's where it's at and everything. And then you'd be filing. And these are the Adl's. And

158
00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:49.740
P27: that's that's what's going on there. So I think that would be

159
00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:54.841
P27: really critical to have that full understanding beforehand.

160
00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:01.890
P27: And the next most critical thing that has to be in there.

161
00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.889
P27: And this is where where the system is broken. Okay?

162
00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:09.290
P27: And I don't know if this portion has been fixed.

163
00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:13.409
P27: but because it is a Vha program

164
00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:15.610
P27: with the Vh.

165
00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:19.410
P27: with the Vba, okay, I'm a Vso.

166
00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:28.470
P27: You're a veteran. Okay? You come to me. I help you file the claim. The claim gets denied. Okay, I file. The appeal.

167
00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:41.080
P27: Okay, the appeal gets denied. Go to a higher level review court of veterans appeals, and we really push it way up there. And this can sometimes take years upon years

168
00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:48.630
P27: to get your claim done. Okay, and get you awarded the benefits, and you'd be back paid to the original date from the

169
00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:55.489
P27: initial claim. Okay? But there's multiple levels to appeal it and provide new evidence and things like that.

170
00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:59.170
P27: With the Vha side of the house.

171
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.260
P27: I submitted. The Vha.

172
00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:04.299
P27: The Vha. Denies it.

173
00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:07.209
P27: I appeal it. They deny it again.

174
00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:11.189
P27: Bang! Done over can never be submitted again.

175
00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:12.540
P27: Okay.

176
00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:23.110
P27: that's a problem we've run into. So we're forced to. Truly, honestly tell folks don't file for this, because if it gets denied because the rules are so broken right now

177
00:14:23.986 --> 00:14:30.500
P27: you would only get one appeal, and if that gets denied, you can't put in for it again again. That's a Vha

178
00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:35.330
P27: side of the house. That needs to really be put in

179
00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:38.010
P27: clarity as far as

180
00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:51.100
P27: what the appeals process is, and how many times and everything. Because, again, if you go in there with the understanding that the Vba rules apply. It's all the veterans administration, but it it's

181
00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:52.139
P27: you know.

182
00:14:53.500 --> 00:15:09.049
P27: it's just not the same, you know. It's a it's it's giraffe and a dog, basically, because the rules that apply here and do afford you the opportunities do not apply here. Here. It's a 1 time, you know, one appeal and done so.

183
00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:11.380
P27: and then the other thing is to

184
00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:24.480
P27: really identify the difference between this and aid and attendance, because there is a difference between aid attendance and the Pcafc, which is both administered by the Vha.

185
00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:30.549
Moderator: you understand a lot of the inner workings. But the average person does not.

186
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:36.359
P27: That's it, they really don't. And it truly, if they try to. And this is a part of the problem.

187
00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.849
P27: because it is that intricate.

188
00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:40.410
P27: The average person

189
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:43.840
P27: files for it themselves. Okay?

190
00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:51.479
P27: And as a Vso. I always tell people do not ever file your claim because you will screw it up because you filed one claim.

191
00:15:51.650 --> 00:16:05.160
P27: We file thousands of them. So we know all the tricks and tips and everything else. We don't get paid. It's illegal. It's a service we provide. Let us handle it for you, and we handle it, and we get it done. We can't do that with this.

192
00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:11.789
P27: because the Vha says they're not going to talk to us. They're only going to speak with the veteran. So the veteran's left hanging

193
00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:16.659
P27: with the Vha gorilla that knows the whole program and everything.

194
00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:31.839
P27: And and you know the veteran that doesn't know the ins and outs and tricks and everything, and what Adls are, and what what the differences are, and how to appeal it, and how many times you can. They don't know that. So you know, if the Vha says you're denied.

195
00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:41.199
P27: But you can appeal. Here's the appeal, and you don't do anything different, because you don't know what, why it was denied, or whatever you submit again. Okay, still denied back. And you're done.

196
00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:44.449
P27: What service have you just provided to that veteran?

197
00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:54.069
P27: And they they have nobody that they can go to for representation, because the Vha. Won't talk to anybody except the veteran.

198
00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.100
Moderator: Gotcha.

199
00:16:57.070 --> 00:17:05.420
P27: And again, that's that's really not. I don't think part of your issue here, but that's part of the problem and the frustration that people run into.

200
00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:09.890

P27: Okay, I don't wanna go to that link. But I do want to bring up. I gotta fix this curtain first, st because this song is really beat me bad today.

269
00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.270
Moderator: Overall.

270
00:22:18.293 --> 00:22:22.230
P27: So here's part of the issue that we've run into

271
00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:27.500
P27: is a Vba 2122 power of attorney.

272
00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:31.700
P27: Now you would think that because it's a

273
00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:35.799
P27: a Vba form that would be acceptable.

274
00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:37.830
P27: And it's not

275
00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:41.200
P27: come on.

276
00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:46.539
P27: It's not. They will not accept a

277
00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:50.960
P27: Vba. 2122 power of attorney

278
00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:55.799
P27: from the veterans benefits administration, because we've tried that in the past.

279
00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:58.899
P27: and they have said, That's not a good power of attorney.

280
00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:00.850
Moderator: Gotcha.

281
00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:02.829
P27: You know. So it's kind of like, okay.

282
00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:16.450
P27: veterans get frustrated and annoyed because they're working with a veteran service officer. I already gave the Va. Power of attorney, the Bva. Power of attorney to represent me, and everything that's not true, because you only did that for the Vba.

283
00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:18.799
P27: not for vha.

284
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.990
P27: so this is that you know, oil and water thing here, that where it's

285
00:23:23.623 --> 00:23:30.209
P27: they don't mix. And that's that's a problem. And this is one of the biggest areas right there that frustrates veterans

286
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:34.259
P27: and us veteran service officers. It really frustrates us because it's.

287
00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:39.020
P27: you know, if it's a if it's a 10 dash, form, or whatever.

288
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.159
P27: no joy

289
00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:42.550
P27: so.

290
00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:45.440
Moderator: Thank you. That's helpful.

291
00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:49.109
P27: Yeah, what if I have questions or need help with this application?

292

P27: Tdy set and ask for help filling out the form.

296
00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:19.540
P27: Will it find a caregiver support team coordinator at your nearest Va. Health facility? 2 of 3 go to our caregiver support program teams directory link. Will it get help from an accredited representative like a veteran service organization? Vso. 3 of 3.

297
00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:21.210
P27: See it says it here.

298
00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:24.260
P27: If they come to us they won't talk to us.

299
00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:26.839
P27: Been there done that.

300
00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:37.350
P27: Yeah, at least here in Biloxi. Now I will tell you across the Va. Maybe there are other vas that will help, but I have not heard of them yet.

301
00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:44.950
P27: Okay, learn more about getting help from an accredited representative. Link end of list. What's a caregiver support team?

302
00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:47.629

P27: Start your application.

304
00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:51.940
P27: and the only thing I would.

305
00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:57.560
P27: and I don't know how to. I don't even know what advice I would give you.

306
00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:05.770
P27: but you know, with the budgeting and everything and all that as people are leaving, they're not filling those positions.

307
00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:08.669
P27: So the frustration level

308
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:10.100
P27: of veterans

309
00:25:10.999 --> 00:25:15.310
P27: trying to find something to help do. This is

310
00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.050
P27: going to be a lot higher, too.

311
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:26.979
P27: We'll take you through each step of the process. If the veteran is already enrolled in this program and wants to add a new family caregiver, the veteran, and the new caregiver can use this application.

312
00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:32.119
P27: No, there can only be one primary, and up to 2 secondary family caregivers at any one time.

313
00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:33.249
P27: End of list.

314
00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:37.080

P27: with the phone numbers

326
00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:49.050
P27: again. I know this is not part of you with the form here, but it's it's a pain in the butt, because

327
00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:54.019
P27: the primary phone number for contacting the Va is 808-27-1000.

328
00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:56.630
P27: And that's where

329
00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:01.049
P27: most of the time they're being directed. So

330
00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:08.690
P27: yeah, I don't know if there's a good answer for that.

331
00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:10.010
P27: I don't know.

332
00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:16.109
P27: So, anyway. But yeah, this this was clear. I of course I didn't hit any links.

333
00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:23.009
P27: but the way I typically do things like this, I read the whole thing just like this until I have it ingrained in my brain

334
00:27:23.631 --> 00:27:26.518
P27: several times, you know, helping people

335
00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:32.530
P27: and that's part of my mentality, just knowing to read the whole thing first, st and then

336
00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:33.989
P27: follow through

337
00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:35.160
P27: so.

338
00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:41.109
Moderator: Okay, did anything stand out to you as being particularly confusing or helpful.

339
00:27:42.402 --> 00:27:49.847
P27: Helpful? Yeah, you had the links there which was perfect. I I like how you did that. Having the links.

340
00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:56.060
P27: for example, the eligibility link. Okay, instead of spelling it all here. Okay?

341
00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:58.999
P27: Because what I would do

342
00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:00.190
P27: for me

343
00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:22.910
P27: is I would go to the eligibility link. I'd read through the eligibility. Am I even eligible? Okay, if I'm eligible, then I would go back, and I don't have to read through all that every time I go through this list. I just know there and then I can hit the link, and you know, expand on it there 25 pages, if need be, and come back here, and it's not in the middle of the meat and potatoes here. So I really like how you got the link set up there.

344
00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:39.820
P27: I think that'll be a good good call again, and not having gone into them right now. I think that works out very well. This is, you know this is not a killer in length and and everything. It's a it's a relatively easy page here, you know.

345
00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:52.809
Moderator: If you were to rate this page on a scale of one to 5, 1 being the worst 5 being the best. How prepared and informed. Do you feel about the application you're about to begin? Based on the page's content?

346
00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:54.509
P27: I'd say 5.

347
00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:55.850
Moderator: Okay.

348
00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:02.759
P27: I say 4, simply because I'm blind as a pain in the butt. But this is actually one really good. This is, this is really good.

349
00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:05.029
P27: I think it was really clearly well done.

350
00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:11.159
Moderator: Okay, thank you. So I'm gonna have you start the application now as if you were applying.

351
00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:12.210
P27: Okay.

352
00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:23.450
P27: Hello, great one. You are looking good today. It's end of list.

353
00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:27.109
P27: So you see how it just said, Hello, great one! You're looking good today.

354
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:27.800
Moderator: Yeah.

355
00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:29.619
P27: That's a Sequoia issue.

356
00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:31.040
Moderator: Oh, interesting!

357
00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:37.910
P27: So when I when I actually was navigating back up quick nav, and I just held the button down to go all the way back to the top it went spastic.

358
00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:39.870
Moderator: Okay. Gotcha.

359
00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:47.639
P27: And and again, that's not a form issue. That's not a problem with this form. That's a sequoia issue. So when you hear these things from people. It just

360
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:50.569
P27: kind of keep that one in the back of your brain. There.

361
00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:51.449
Moderator: Yeah, thank, you.

362

366
00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:23.700
P27: I would look at those and all that would be good. Then it would go here.

367
00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:24.910
P27: and

368
00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:26.250

401
00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:02.279
P27: So that did that

402
00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:25.750
P27: Tab veterans last name star required veterans, personal and Tracy Ralph Farrow, home, Filbert, select veteran suffix veterans, personal information. Select month veteran's date of birth star required 806, 9, 8 to apply for the program of comprehensive. So when you start trying to navigate through there. It kind of gets a bit wonky. Personal information.

403
00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:30.110
P27: Select month menu, check mark, hyphen, select hyphen.

404
00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:34.140
P27: Okay.

405
00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:38.430
P27: quick. Nav off quick. Navon. January, February.

406
00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:43.850

P27: Apply for the program of comprehensive assistance for day veteran's date of birth star required, for example, January year. Veteran's date of birth star required, for example, female. What's the veteran sex live?

P27: Okay? That was male. What's the veteran sex listed at birth? Selected

409
00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:02.070
P27: mail

P27: back. Main. Continue.

411
00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:06.480
P27: Okay.

412
00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:10.790
P27: Veterans, personal information. No, something didn't happen correctly there.

413
00:34:12.727 --> 00:34:16.469
P27: And this is where it really gets to be a pain in the ass.

414
00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:27.500
P27: Hello, great one! You are looking good today. Safari, caregiver application for benefits, vertical line veterans, affairs. Window has keyboard focus.

415
00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:43.930
P27: and that was just simply zooming in, and I still have not figured veterans. Middle name, veteran's personal information, legal name that's documented with the Social Security Administration veteran's middle name, veteran's personal information

416
00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:53.340
P27: to veterans. Last name star required select veteran suffix veterans. October month 1515. So apparently Autofill won't work there.

417
00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:55.980
P27: Well, veterans, personal information for the.

418

Moderator: Which one.

419
00:34:57.180 --> 00:35:01.140
P27: For the names, because I did that with auto fail.

420
00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:03.400
P27: And

421
00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:07.259
P27: it filled it in here, but it wouldn't. It wouldn't accept it.

422
00:35:09.490 --> 00:35:11.210
Moderator: Okay, that's really helpful.

423
00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:16.029
P27: Yeah, cause a lot of this. If I can do it with Autofill, it's just easier.

424
00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:17.240
Moderator: Yeah, so.

425
00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:19.120
P27: Okay.

426
00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:20.870
Moderator: Do you have to type it in.

427
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:24.910
P27: I just typed it in now. So let's see what happens now, because I did type it in now.

428
00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:29.489
P27: and I'll just tab down to that mail. What's the fact name? Continue.

429
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:33.980
P27: Continue. Take. Okay. So took at that time.

430
00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:38.380
P27: So yeah, in the in the other screen. When I did the auto fill.

431
00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:41.140
P27: It wouldn't let me do Autofill on a birthday.

432
00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:44.629
P27: So I had to go in there and and navigate down to it.

433
00:35:45.133 --> 00:35:47.300
P27: Are you a Mac user.

434
00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:48.090
Moderator: Yes.

435
00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:53.729
P27: Okay. So you know how, when you initially get there, if you hit like, oh, it would come up and go to October.

436
00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:58.860
P27: It wasn't doing that, so I had to navigate down to October and select it.

437
00:35:59.110 --> 00:36:03.940
P27: So the birth date and the gender I selected manually like that.

438
00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:10.180
P27: But the name first, st middle, and last I did on the Autofill, and it didn't take it on the Autofill.

439
00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:13.550
Moderator: Got it. Thank you. That's really helpful.

440
00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:15.199
P27: Yeah. Yeah. And

441
00:36:15.490 --> 00:36:19.700
P27: you know, on the auto fill, I don't know why I didn't take it on there, because I got it set up to do that.

442
00:36:20.170 --> 00:36:36.280
P27: Let's see what we got here need help. If you have trouble, use 800 left parenthesis, Tdy, full stop. You can call the Va. Character 855 left parenthesis. Tdy left 8 full stop. Tdy left parent 800. If you have trouble, need help, continue back. End up.

443
00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:41.040
P27: So this one here see how, when I went to it, I I

444
00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:44.709
P27: went right arrow, trying to get to the block I needed.

445
00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:52.660
P27: and it brought me to the very bottom, so I don't know how to make it go to top. I don't begin it. I don't know if that's a function of setting up the

446
00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:55.769
P27: web page, or if it's a function of Sequoia.

447
00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:57.550
Moderator: Okay.

448
00:36:57.950 --> 00:37:00.679
P27: Okay. So you said, you want me to use a certain social.

482
00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:42.589
P27: Okay. So that's only gonna continue. So let's see what happened there.

483

488
00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:11.980
P27: No.

489
00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:13.220
Moderator: Trying to do there.

490
00:41:14.170 --> 00:41:15.659
Moderator: What were you trying to do there?

491
00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:16.480
Moderator: Just continue.

492
00:41:16.846 --> 00:41:20.880
P27: Okay. So with quick nav. When you have quick nav on

493
00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:25.520
P27: you can hit the up and down arrows at the same time to select.

494
00:41:26.818 --> 00:41:30.250
P27: It'll select what's in the focus box. Okay.

495
00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:34.699
P27: even though the blue highlight that would typically be return.

496
00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:40.359
P27: So wherever you are on the screen. If you hit return, it's gonna hit that highlighted continue box

497
00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:46.379
P27: if you hit the up and down arrow where the focus box is

498
00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:49.679
P27: and or you can hit voiceover

499
00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:51.030
P27: spacebar

500
00:41:51.220 --> 00:42:00.140
P27: to select where the focus box is. So if the focus box is on on the on the male female gender select and you want to select that

501
00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:05.449
P27: you can either voice over space bar, or up and down arrow if quick nav is on.

502
00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:09.820
P27: But when quick nav is on. You can't type in the fields.

503
00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:11.160
P27: Okay.

504
00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:16.460
P27: that's the problem I've been having with Apple, with Sequoia and Sonoma.

505
00:42:17.038 --> 00:42:26.289
P27: That I was telling about earlier. So that's again. I don't think that's anything you can fix on your end, because this is A, this is a OS issue

506
00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:29.179
P27: versus a app issue. So

507
00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:36.409
P27: that's unfortunately, if it doesn't work and somebody tries doing it that way, you may get the call.

508
00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:41.090
P27: you know, saying it's not working, it's not working, and it's truly, not your your

509
00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:49.160
P27: fault if you will, your your issue, your concern. It's not anything you can do. It's actually an OS, because it's gonna happen anywhere. They go.

510
00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:57.709
P27: Okay, now the auto fill. That is an app function cause. I know Autofill still working on other stuff because I've used it.

511
00:42:57.790 --> 00:43:02.119
P27: So why, it's not grabbing and accepting the Autofill. I don't know.

512
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:05.440
Moderator: Yeah, we've been seeing some issues with that. So it

513
00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:08.519
Moderator: it's even worse. Obviously, if you're on a screen, reader. So.

514
00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:09.060
P27: Yeah.

515
00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:10.560
Moderator: That was helpful. Appreciate it.

516
00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:11.130
P27: Yeah, I.

517
00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:12.090
Moderator: Do that.

518
00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:21.910
P27: Yeah, I I got enough vision. You could see me zooming it in super hard, huge to see that there's something I still can't read what's there? I could just see there's something there so.

519
00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:22.480
Moderator: Okay.

520
00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:29.509
P27: Okay. So now we're to the next page. We'll start with Tab and see what it does. City, state or postal code search. Okay.

521
00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:36.530
P27: apply for the program of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers. Link list, 4 items, city, state or postal code. Search.

522
00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:56.900
P27: Search back. Main. Okay? What is it asking for Search City. Apply for the program. Health and disability benefits for family and caregivers. Link apply for the program of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers, link, city state or postal code search. So I'm tabbing, but it's asking it wants a city of something, but I don't know what.

523
00:43:57.610 --> 00:44:00.720
Moderator: Yeah, it's interesting. It like, skipped over the question.

524
00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:10.890
P27: Yeah, let me go back up. I'm going to go back up. Okay. So there I am. There. I'm going to try quick, Navna, so there's quick nav on. I'm going to arrow right end of list.

525
00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:13.250
P27: end of breadcrumb. The main

526
00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:17.220
P27: apply for the program of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers.

527
00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:22.529
P27: Application for the program of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers. Va, 4 items.

528
00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:29.719
P27: What Va. Medical Center or clinic does the veteran get or plan to get their health care. So using Quicknav to get there.

529
00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:31.720
P27: I can get there

530
00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:36.080
P27: using Tab to get there. I couldn't get there.

531
00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:37.940
Moderator: Yeah, that's interesting.

532
00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:43.829
P27: Yeah. And again, that's the one that's the kind of thing there. I don't know if that's a app issue or an OS issue.

533
00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:45.950
P27: Okay.

534
00:44:47.050 --> 00:44:49.410
Moderator: If you were navigating a format.

535
00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:58.049
Moderator: would you likely, if you were navigating this form, would you likely be doing the tabbing or using the quick nav and the arrow.

536
00:44:58.190 --> 00:45:00.959
P27: I personally like using quick nav.

537
00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:01.900
Moderator: But.

538
00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:08.980
P27: because that's just the way I was trained initially, and I use it. And it's just quicker and easier for me.

539
00:45:09.399 --> 00:45:14.139
P27: Because let me try this real quick. Do do you know quick Nav, do you know what that is?

540
00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:15.410
Moderator: No.

541
00:45:15.610 --> 00:45:23.709
P27: Okay, okay. So I'm gonna turn. Let me make sure it's on. I think it is okay. So quick. Nav off and on.

542
00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:34.359
P27: What I'm going to do is I'm going to hit the arrow up and to the right, and it's going to go into the rotor. Okay, visually. You never use a rotor in in your

543
00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:41.809
P27: in what you do. But I want you to think of it like this. It's a big round wheel, okay?

544
00:45:42.110 --> 00:45:46.639
P27: And on that wheel you have different sectors, and each one of those will have a

545
00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:53.278
P27: wheel of fortune wheel. Okay? So, for example, it'll say you bring it around to

546
00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:55.029
P27: typing style.

547
00:45:55.170 --> 00:46:03.640
P27: touch, typing, regular typing, whatever. So you'd rotate with 2 fingers on the on the screen, on the phone or up into the right or

548
00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:05.240
P27: up and to the left.

549
00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:13.699
P27: on a, on the keyboard. It would rotate around to typing style, and then on the phone you would single finger flick up or down.

550
00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:19.810
P27: or on the keyboard, you would arrow up or down to go through the different styles, so you'd have typing style. You'd have

551
00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:24.370
P27: headings. You'd have links. So if you went to Links, you know you would go there, and

552
00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:26.969
P27: you you'd move down, up and down the link. So I'm

553
00:46:27.010 --> 00:46:29.420
P27: I'm going to try to hit up and to the right

554
00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:32.420
P27: headings. Okay, see that how it said headings.

555
00:46:33.650 --> 00:46:37.850
P27: I'm gonna try to hit it again. Form control. Okay, there we go. Text fields.

556
00:46:38.210 --> 00:46:39.010
P27: lists.

557
00:46:39.770 --> 00:46:40.680
P27: buttons.

558
00:46:41.290 --> 00:46:42.210
P27: lines.

559
00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:43.780
P27: landmarks.

560
00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:48.899
P27: navigation characters, words, window spots, misspelled links.

561
00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:50.720
P27: So I'm going to hear the links.

562
00:46:50.730 --> 00:46:54.040
P27: And I'm just going to arrow down now

563
00:46:54.310 --> 00:47:00.619
P27: to see. Actually, that's 1st time that's worked here since since I've tried it with Sequoia. So they got that part fixed

564
00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:03.550
P27: because it was only on Sonoma.

565
00:47:03.790 --> 00:47:09.130
P27: You had to every time you went to a different setting and turned quick nav off and turn it back on.

566
00:47:09.490 --> 00:47:18.150
P27: So they got that part fixed with the Sequoia update. So I'm going to hit the arrow down. 806, 9, 8. So there's the 1st link. It goes to

567
00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:30.949
P27: Tdy. 7, 1, 1. There's the next link 8, 5, 5, 2, 6, 0, Tdy. 7, 1, 1. That's how it's going through links. So let me go to these would be form controls. I think headings

568
00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:32.470
P27: form controls.

569
00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:35.300
P27: veterans, crisis line, give feedback.

570
00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:38.100
P27: continue back search.

571
00:47:38.370 --> 00:47:42.200
P27: city, state or postal code. So there's the form control. So you see how I'm

572
00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:47.120
P27: and I'm at the end one. That's the let. That's at the very top. So it

573
00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:49.859
P27: and now it's not working

574
00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:54.660
P27: quick. Nav off quick. Nav on text fields.

575
00:47:54.930 --> 00:47:59.049
P27: form controls, search, city, state or postal code.

576
00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:04.500
P27: So now I'm there. I gotta stop there. It won't let me go any further until I turn.

577
00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:06.850
P27: I'd probably go Arrow right

578
00:48:06.970 --> 00:48:11.259
P27: to get there. But now I'm there in the form of control for the search for the city.

579
00:48:11.730 --> 00:48:12.700
P27: Okay.

580
00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:15.450
P27: so does that make sense how that worked.

581
00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:16.390
Moderator: Yeah.

582
00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:21.010
P27: Okay. So now I will to to, because that's a picker item

583
00:48:21.835 --> 00:48:24.670
P27: I'm gonna up and down with quick nav on

584
00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:27.519
P27: and see if it will give me the pull down.

585
00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:30.100
P27: And it did not.

586
00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:31.400
P27: Okay.

587
00:48:31.610 --> 00:48:32.970
P27: So

588
00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:39.970
P27: that was voice over space bar. So let me type in Biloxi

589
00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:43.750
P27: Reluxe.

590
00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:54.950
P27: Okay? And then I'm gonna arrow to the right and see if it goes to the. So I can't search with quick nav going to the right. I'm gonna tab.

591
00:48:55.310 --> 00:48:58.869
P27: There's search. So now, because I have quick nav

592
00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:00.650
P27: on

593
00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:04.749
P27: by hitting the up and down arrows, it should select that button.

594
00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:10.630
P27: Okay, I'm gonna try it now loading available facilities. Very good. 5 of 5 facilities for Deluxe approved.

595
00:49:13.930 --> 00:49:37.979
P27: So it says, it's loading 105 0 5. So now I'm going to arrow down space crew, Gulf Coast, West Va. Mobile medical unit, clinic, Gulf Coast, West Va. Mobile Medic, Biloxi, Va. Medical Center, 400 veterans, Avenue, Biloxi, Ms. 395-31-2410. So now that's at the bottom of the screen screen. There, I'm going to hit the up and down Arrow, because I think every time I zoom in and out it also changes the quick path

596
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:43.720
P27: activity which I gotta deal with apple on. But I'm gonna hit the up and down arrow and see what it does

597
00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:45.810
P27: is, does that have a radio button.

598
00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:49.049
Moderator: Do you think it does?

599
00:49:49.050 --> 00:49:52.780
P27: I I don't know. I truly cause I

600
00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:55.849
P27: I I don't know. Let me hit the up and down arrow.

601
00:49:56.170 --> 00:49:59.890
P27: Okay, so it does have a radio button, because I saw

602
00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:01.570
P27: shading come up.

603
00:50:02.070 --> 00:50:09.899
P27: Okay. So I know it's on the bottom of screen. There's that list. And I I got just enough vision that it did that. So I selected that.

604
00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:15.389
P27: Now I'm gonna hit. Return to see if it grabs that.

605
00:50:17.770 --> 00:50:19.549
P27: Okay, that didn't

606
00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:30.079
P27: reluxe va medical mobile Va clinic mobile, Va. Clinic slide. L. Va. Clinic slide up Bogalusa, Va. Clinical end up space crew. Load more facilities. Okay?

607
00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:37.020
P27: No. We use the location of the veterans health care facility to find the nearest facility that processes applications back.

608
00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:41.400
P27: Continue. Okay? So I got that one selected. I'm gonna hit. Continue.

609
00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:42.320
Moderator: Okay.

610
00:50:42.555 --> 00:50:44.910
P27: I'm again. I'm gonna hit the up and down arrow

611
00:50:45.060 --> 00:50:45.920
P27: me.

612
00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:49.549
P27: Okay? And that brought me to the next screen. I think.

613
00:50:50.410 --> 00:50:51.010
P27: Learn more.

614
00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:52.690
Moderator: Stuff.

615
00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:53.690
P27: Huh!

616
00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:59.130
Moderator: I have a couple of questions about that facility search step that you just went through.

617
00:50:59.130 --> 00:51:00.020
P27: Okay.

618
00:51:02.250 --> 00:51:03.990
Moderator: What were your thoughts about it?

619
00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:07.660
P27: It was good. It it explained it

620
00:51:08.130 --> 00:51:11.140
P27: concisely and correctly, although.

621
00:51:11.635 --> 00:51:15.220
P27: they weren't all part of the Gulf Coast veterans, healthcare system

622
00:51:16.770 --> 00:51:18.770
P27: but it was good because it gave the

623
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:23.309
P27: regional area the the

624
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:24.630
P27: Oh

625
00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:28.530
P27: geographic, which is good, because.

626
00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:29.913
P27: for example,

627
00:51:31.350 --> 00:51:34.249
P27: in Diamond Hand, Diamond head

628
00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:36.960
P27: folks that live in Diamond Head.

629
00:51:36.970 --> 00:51:39.429
P27: maybe part of the New Orleans

630
00:51:40.330 --> 00:51:41.649
P27: healthcare system

631
00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:44.070
P27: and go to Sidedale Clinic.

632
00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:55.913
P27: Okay? So it gave them that. Why, they would have select Biloxi. I don't know but they might come over here and have that there. So it gives that good variety.

633
00:51:56.880 --> 00:52:01.889
P27: again. I'm a poor example, poor person to ask on this, because I'm retired military.

634
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:05.299
P27: So my health care. I get through keys. But primarily.

635
00:52:05.740 --> 00:52:09.030
P27: But if a person is not primarily.

636
00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:19.850
P27: you know if they're not retired military, they may go to one healthcare system for one type of service and a another healthcare system for a different type of service.

637
00:52:20.621 --> 00:52:28.249
P27: Cancer treatment, for example, because I don't think we have oncology here. But I'm pretty sure New Orleans does have oncology, I think.

638
00:52:28.610 --> 00:52:32.440
P27: But that would be a good example of. You know they may get all their primary care through

639
00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:40.189
P27: Gulf Coast, but oncology services through Slidell, which is part of the Nola system. So

640
00:52:40.250 --> 00:52:43.080
P27: I think that's actually a really good

641
00:52:44.830 --> 00:52:46.340
P27: having it that way.

642
00:52:46.650 --> 00:52:49.679
P27: you know, it's not just limiting you to

643
00:52:49.740 --> 00:52:58.850
P27: the actually, I could tell you right now. Honestly, now, I think about it, because the Gulf Coast veterans healthcare system actually starts at the Louisiana State line goes

644
00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:03.020
P27: all the way over to Eastern time zone change by Panama City, Florida.

645
00:53:03.290 --> 00:53:04.250
P27: Okay?

646
00:53:04.370 --> 00:53:07.930
P27: So it didn't list Fort Walton Beach, or

647
00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:18.950
P27: or Panama City, or whatever. But it did go into slide. L, which is the other healthcare system. So again, the geographic location, I think, is better than the specific healthcare system and what they control

648
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:23.280
P27: another one. So I think that's really good like that.

649
00:53:23.950 --> 00:53:26.899
Moderator: Okay. And why did you choose the facility that you did.

650
00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:28.539
P27: Because that's the one I use.

651
00:53:28.850 --> 00:53:29.480
Moderator: Okay.

652
00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:31.300
P27: I think.

653
00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:37.999
Moderator: Yeah, if you were gonna rate, that process of selecting a facility, one to 5, 1 being the worst 5 being the best.

654
00:53:38.290 --> 00:53:39.999
Moderator: how would you rate that process.

655
00:53:40.290 --> 00:53:41.650
P27: I would say 5

656
00:53:41.810 --> 00:53:42.730
P27: lovely.

657
00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:49.429
Moderator: On this page. What does the term primary caregiver mean to you?

658
00:53:50.073 --> 00:53:51.253

Is the primary selected?

748
01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:53.960
P27: Yeah. And you see how that went from No up to the next one and skip the Yes until it went back down.

749
01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:54.820
Moderator: Yeah.

750
01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:58.770
P27: That's 1 of the things I've that's a OS issue

751
01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:05.340
P27: that on a tab or shift tab, it will skip one

752
01:02:05.610 --> 01:02:10.270
P27: that's not just on this app, that's on several different apps. So that is an OS issue.

753
01:02:11.033 --> 01:02:18.740
P27: So that that is a again, not not a problem with your programming. It's theirs.

754
01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:25.879
Moderator: And if you were filling this form out for real, would you want your caregiver to be here with you, filling this out.

755
01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:27.100
P27: Definitely.

756
01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:29.920
Moderator: Okay, would you have.

757
01:02:30.990 --> 01:02:32.580
Moderator: Would you have her fill it out.

758
01:02:34.968 --> 01:02:38.639
P27: Boy, that's a real tough one to ask.

759
01:02:39.654 --> 01:02:40.439
P27: Because

760
01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:42.609
P27: I can't use the computer

761
01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:44.619
P27: without voice over.

762
01:02:45.670 --> 01:02:47.110
P27: And

763
01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:50.630
P27: Voicel drives her crazy. So I got to turn it off.

764
01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:53.850
P27: and then, if she doesn't understand what's being asked.

765
01:02:53.930 --> 01:03:00.229
P27: she'll ask me to, well, what does this mean? It's like, well, I don't know, because I don't know what it says. So that's a real tough one.

766
01:03:02.370 --> 01:03:03.050
P27: okay.

767
01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:18.599
P27: yeah. I, you know. And that's that's gonna honestly, that's really gonna be a tough answer for anybody to ask, because that's gonna be just the intra personal dynamics of a situation. Now I do know that if I'm working with a veteran and filling this form out

768
01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:22.480
P27: 99 times out of a hundred.

769
01:03:22.650 --> 01:03:25.720
P27: the veteran won't have all the information needed.

770
01:03:26.070 --> 01:03:27.380
P27: They may.

771
01:03:27.650 --> 01:03:30.680
P27: But typically they'll be missing something.

772
01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:34.509
P27: And whether that's because of of cognitive issues, because of

773
01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:43.040
P27: anxieties because of nervous. Who knows? Okay? So in those cases, I typically would have the spouse on the phone

774
01:03:43.594 --> 01:03:48.070
P27: and going through with the spouse and the veteran at the same time.

775
01:03:48.748 --> 01:03:51.489
P27: Just so. There's clarity and

776
01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:55.700
P27: and full understanding between the 2, and I've truly

777
01:03:55.730 --> 01:03:59.460
P27: have only ever had one veteran

778
01:03:59.750 --> 01:04:02.539
P27: absolutely, positively did not want the spouse to have

779
01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:04.750
P27: any information at all period, Dot.

780
01:04:05.020 --> 01:04:05.900
P27: And

781
01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:13.380
P27: sadly, we couldn't even help him, because it was information we needed from the spouse. He didn't have it, and we couldn't. You know we were at the wall.

782
01:04:13.550 --> 01:04:16.109
P27: And so if I don't get this information from her.

783
01:04:16.530 --> 01:04:21.077
P27: there's nothing I can do to help you, and he was not willing to get her involved, because

784
01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:28.710
P27: whatever reasons. So for the most part, though, I would say, Yeah, the spouses and everything would be helping to fill these things out.

785
01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:30.760
P27: Okay.

786
01:04:31.150 --> 01:04:32.369
Moderator: You can keep going.

787
01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:56.370

Moderator: We'll have a question first.st What does a secondary caregiver mean to you?

794
01:05:39.090 --> 01:05:40.410
P27: an alternate

795
01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:48.780
P27: knowing what it is. This is one I would have to explain to people it's got to be. I I couldn't use my son living in Germany

796
01:05:48.830 --> 01:05:50.880
P27: because he's not here providing care.

797
01:05:50.930 --> 01:05:53.010
P27: I could use

798
01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:57.360
P27: my neighbor, who lives right next door and helps make sure that I don't

799
01:05:57.550 --> 01:05:58.970
P27: do something stupid.

800
01:06:00.810 --> 01:06:04.089
P27: so it's gotta be somebody there with you. That

801
01:06:04.150 --> 01:06:05.940
P27: is a caregiver.

802
01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:08.340
P27: you know, not just a family member.

803
01:06:08.910 --> 01:06:10.479
Moderator: Okay, Gotcha.

804
01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:17.139
Moderator: how do you think that that secondary caregiver role differs in the application process and the benefits from the primary caregiver.

805
01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:22.828
P27: they would be only

806
01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:27.320
P27: if my primary was gone for a month or so. My understanding of how this works

807
01:06:27.752 --> 01:06:36.539
P27: is that, you know, if my primary was gone for a month on vacation, going somewhere, doing something like that, and they came in, it would transfer the the

808
01:06:37.850 --> 01:06:40.310
P27: benefits to that person when

809
01:06:41.250 --> 01:06:41.935
P27: when

810
01:06:43.690 --> 01:06:46.020
P27: requested, I guess would be the right word.

811
01:06:47.070 --> 01:06:47.760
Moderator: Okay.

812
01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:52.110
Moderator: thank you. Just for the sake of time. Let's say no to this one.

813
01:06:52.110 --> 01:06:52.880
P27: Okay.

814
01:06:53.290 --> 01:06:57.339
P27: Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. No.

Moderator: It doesn't agree with us. There.

821
01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:18.260
Moderator: Yeah.

822
01:07:18.650 --> 01:07:25.079
P27: So that's going to be the reader that always has in their things. I don't know why it's popping up now

823

827
01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:58.949
P27: First, st we need to know if the veteran will sign this application, or if the representative will sign for them.

828
01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:06.879
P27: a representative must have legal authority to make decisions on behalf of the veteran, or they must have authority to fill out or sign applications on behalf of the veteran.

829
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:12.250
P27: If you select that you're the veteran's representative. We'll ask you to upload a document that proves you have this authority.

830
01:08:12.490 --> 01:08:15.420
P27: Learn more about the types of documents we can and can't accept.

P27: I'm the veteran and signing. For myself.

836
01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:37.769
P27: I'm a representative with legal authority, signing on behalf of the veteran.

837

P27: I'm a representative would end up select who assigned no, we use learn more about the types of documents we can. And if you select that you're the veterans representative, learn more about the types of documents we can and can't accept.

838

P27: You can submit one of these types of documents.

841
01:09:05.470 --> 01:09:06.810
P27: List 6 items.

842
01:09:06.859 --> 01:09:33.740
P27: black square, a valid power of attorney, or one of Black square, a legal guardianship order, or black square. Another type of legal document that your State considers proof of this authority, or black square alternate signer certification, va. Form 21 0 9, 7, 2 or 4 of black square appointment of veteran service organization as claimants. Representative Va. Form 2122, or 5 of 6. Black, square appointment of individual as claimants. Representative Va. Form 21 negative, 22, a 6 end of list.

843
01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:41.839
P27: We can't accept a marriage certificate driver's license or release of information form uploading a document that we can't accept may delay the application process.

844
01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:53.719
P27: No, we use this signature only to process your application. Signing for the veteran today doesn't take away their right to make decisions for their care. Select who will sign for the veteran today. So that's really good that you have that there.

845
01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:59.359
P27: that may give us a little bit of a leg up in dealing with the folks that

846
01:09:59.380 --> 01:10:01.360
P27: consistently tell us no.

847
01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:04.259
P27: that make sense.

848
01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:07.459
Moderator: Yeah. Are you talking about that dropdown that you read.

849
01:10:07.460 --> 01:10:12.699
P27: Yeah, yeah, because it. This is the Va, this is the Va generated

850
01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:15.779
P27: stuff to do this.

851
01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:20.660
P27: So when the Va says we don't accept that it's like, well, wait a minute.

852
01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:23.169
P27: Here it is, you know. Quit.

853
01:10:23.310 --> 01:10:29.689
P27: you know one of us doesn't know what's going on, and I sincerely believe it's the people that won't accept that, you know.

854
01:10:30.542 --> 01:10:43.840
P27: Because again, like, I say, I've I've had it where they've said. You know, it's gotta be a lawyer signed power of attorney. Blah blah, not a Vso. And that's not what this says, and that's and this is, I believe, correct. You got it right. Okay.

855
01:10:43.870 --> 01:10:45.729
P27: I don't believe that they do.

856
01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:50.849
P27: And I base that only on the fact that I got a Federal judge who's also a Vso. With the Bva.

857
01:10:50.930 --> 01:10:53.700
P27: And even, he says, Yeah, that's not right. So

858
01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:55.800
P27: okay, yeah.

859
01:10:56.140 --> 01:11:01.300
P27: select. Who will sign for the veteran today I'm the veteran and signing for myself. So which one you want me to go with.

860
01:11:01.980 --> 01:11:04.960
Moderator: Well, do you have someone who's a legal representative for you?

861
01:11:05.630 --> 01:11:08.475
P27: Yeah, actually, I got a Bva, the Bba has my

862
01:11:08.910 --> 01:11:11.780
P27: has it been a power of attorney for me?

863
01:11:12.130 --> 01:11:17.350
Moderator: Okay. Well, if you were filling it this out for real, what would you select here?

864
01:11:17.770 --> 01:11:22.130
P27: I would select that because I'd be helping veterans typically do this.

865
01:11:23.125 --> 01:11:23.820
P27: So.

866
01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:25.000
Moderator: Filling it out for yourself, though.

867
01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:25.913
P27: My name's

868
01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:28.999
Moderator: Let's say you are filling it out for yourself.

869
01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:30.660
P27: For me.

870
01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:31.850
P27: Yeah.

871
01:11:31.850 --> 01:11:36.389
Moderator: For if you were applying to have a primary caregiver

872
01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:39.829
Moderator: like we've gone through this form. Which of these would you select?

873
01:11:40.130 --> 01:11:42.519
P27: If I was doing it for me, I would select for me.

874
01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:50.919
P27: But again, that's not something I would recommend. Honestly, I I would, just because of what I do as a Vso. I would not recommend that they do this.

875
01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:54.660
P27: I'd I'd have them get with the Vso. And have them do it

876
01:11:55.401 --> 01:11:58.060
P27: just just because it's always

877
01:11:58.430 --> 01:12:05.459
P27: it. It's just proven better in the veterans interests to have a somebody who's done a bunch of them do it versus them on their own.

878
01:12:05.870 --> 01:12:06.570
Moderator: Okay.

879
01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:13.210
P27: because as a Bso. If they start really driving a veteran crazy.

880
01:12:13.370 --> 01:12:17.630
P27: that that's part of the problem is the Va, unfortunately.

881
01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:27.349
P27: different locations interpret things differently. It it's and to me this is, this is leaves no ambiguity here. It's very clear.

882
01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:31.879
P27: But people will, I guarantee it, interpret this thing the way they want.

883
01:12:32.605 --> 01:12:34.240
P27: For whatever reason.

884
01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:39.950
P27: okay, and it will frustrate veterans. And that's why I always say, don't don't let that happen.

885
01:12:40.639 --> 01:12:44.009
P27: Do? Do you have a minute to listen to a real quick one?

886
01:12:44.490 --> 01:12:45.870
P27: Do we have time.

887
01:12:47.425 --> 01:12:47.970
Moderator: Sure!

888
01:12:47.970 --> 01:12:51.179
P27: Okay. So what I presented to Congress the 1st time

889
01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:53.009
P27: I had a veteran who

890
01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:58.960
P27: had diabetic retinopathy and diabetic neuropathy, and they cut their foot.

891
01:12:59.060 --> 01:13:03.899
P27: and when they were bathing their foot felt warm. So they took their temperature. They had a temperature

892
01:13:04.010 --> 01:13:07.269
P27: set up with primary care, got in there to get an appointment done.

893
01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:19.900
P27: The doctor told them point blank. If you'd come in here tomorrow we'd be chopping your foot off. Okay, because they were blind and neuropathy. They didn't even know they had a piece broken glass on the floor, or whatever cut them.

894
01:13:20.140 --> 01:13:22.639
P27: and they got infected and nearly lost their foot.

895
01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:23.930
P27: Oh.

896
01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:26.879
P27: this program was denied to them

897
01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:30.999
P27: because they didn't have somebody living with them.

898
01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:36.190
P27: I said, Okay, so then why did you deny the man out in Denver

899
01:13:36.210 --> 01:13:38.039
P27: who in Iraq

900
01:13:38.130 --> 01:13:44.879
P27: is blind in one eye and the other eyeball is completely missing, and he's living with his wife and family.

901
01:13:45.170 --> 01:13:49.089
P27: Okay, he said. He didn't need it because he was living with his wife and family.

902
01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:52.999
P27: So you know, there's the 2 cases on the opposite ends of the spectrum.

903
01:13:53.070 --> 01:14:11.399
P27: And when the Va provided records, it's like, Well, okay, in this case, we're going to apply this rule. And in this case we're going to apply this rule. It's like, No, you can't pick and choose which rule you got to apply them evenly. So that's where I'm going into this thing of not having an individual do it to themselves, because

904
01:14:11.530 --> 01:14:13.829
P27: in the case of each individual

905
01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:23.100
P27: they felt it was just their individual issue when they finally came to us and we presented it. That's when we could say, Okay, here's all these different things, because we have that

906
01:14:23.540 --> 01:14:35.040
P27: vast array of of veterans and situations and and all these things. And that's where it really came up and really brought the focus on the blindness angle that your Adls.

907
01:14:35.190 --> 01:14:42.380
P27: not addressing blindness. Okay? Because in the event, in the one where the veteran had the foot that was cut.

908
01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:45.530
P27: their excuse was not only that

909
01:14:45.948 --> 01:14:50.480
P27: they didn't have somebody living with them, but and this was in writing.

910
01:14:50.490 --> 01:14:56.530
P27: You have gone through blind rehab, so you would not qualify for it, because you've gone through blind, rehab.

911
01:14:56.700 --> 01:15:06.840
P27: blind rehab does not teach you to see, and it does not teach you to feel when you when you have no feeling. Okay. They couldn't feel their foot. They couldn't see their foot.

912
01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:12.619
P27: Okay. But in writing, the reason for denial was, they had gone through blind rehab.

913
01:15:13.170 --> 01:15:13.980
P27: Okay.

914
01:15:14.470 --> 01:15:20.490
P27: that kind of gives you the understanding. Why, I always say, get with a vso. So

915
01:15:21.061 --> 01:15:25.500
P27: in this case, working with a veteran. Any veteran, I would always say.

916
01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:29.299
P27: have the Bva represent you and submit it.

917
01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:30.290
P27: Okay?

Moderator: Okay.

01:23:52.420 --> 01:24:03.819
Moderator: I don't wanna make you suffer through it anymore. But there's an edit button that you have to hit in order to edit it. That's really helpful, though, to see how you would try to edit it, not being able to see that button.

1024
01:24:03.820 --> 01:24:09.760
P27: Okay, yeah, I thought I was, I thought I was in the edit panel. So, yeah, that's

1025
01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:11.320
P27: yeah, very.

1026
01:24:11.330 --> 01:24:20.790
P27: very difficult. Because you because, like. I say, I was getting there. I could hear I was getting there. I was highlighting it, but I couldn't do anything to it, so I can't tell if there's an edit button there.

1027
01:24:20.790 --> 01:24:22.890
Moderator: Okay, thank you so much for trying.

1028
01:24:23.010 --> 01:24:31.480
Moderator: Yeah, I'm curious what your comfort level would be filling out and signing if your wife wasn't here, and you were signing for her.

1029
01:24:32.820 --> 01:24:34.440
P27: Signing for her.

1030
01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:38.579
Moderator: Yeah. How do you feel about that? Where you signed on on this page?

1031
01:24:43.067 --> 01:24:44.410
P27: I I would

1032
01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:47.249
P27: without her knowledge or with her knowledge.

1033
01:24:48.940 --> 01:24:52.270
Moderator: Oh, well, what would you? How how would you go about it?

1034
01:24:52.270 --> 01:24:56.739
P27: With her knowledge, I would have no problem at all without her knowledge. I wouldn't do it.

1035
01:24:56.740 --> 01:24:57.330
Moderator: Okay.

1036
01:24:58.110 --> 01:25:01.363
P27: Okay, it. It's just one of those things

1037
01:25:05.310 --> 01:25:16.160
P27: and I don't know whether you could put in an attestation that you have their knowledge and approval to sign, or I don't know how you would go about that. I don't know the correct legal process to do that.

1038
01:25:16.370 --> 01:25:16.960
Moderator: Yeah.

1039
01:25:18.910 --> 01:25:22.689
P27: because, quite honestly, the way I see it. And I and I hate to say this.

1040
01:25:22.780 --> 01:25:25.700
P27: We've had veterans actually in the blind rehab center

1041
01:25:25.980 --> 01:25:36.719
P27: that the spouse was just waiting for them to come to the blind rehab center and then sent them divorce papers, you know. And so if you start doing things like this? It could get ugly in that respect.

1042
01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:43.310
P27: you know, again, I I don't know the best answer to that. That's.

1043
01:25:44.250 --> 01:25:46.319
P27: you know a legal question.

1044
01:25:46.390 --> 01:25:47.460
P27: Oh.

1045
01:25:49.660 --> 01:25:51.230
Moderator: Okay, yeah, that's helpful.

1046
01:25:51.700 --> 01:25:52.920
P27: Yeah. Cause.

1047
01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:55.639
P27: Oh, gosh! You know

1048
01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:59.040
P27: I don't know, you know, with the Va. You know

1049
01:25:59.150 --> 01:26:02.090
P27: the Va giveth and the Va. Take us away.

1050
01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:03.629
P27: They will give you.

1051
01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:09.050
P27: you know, a hundred dollars a month all the time, but if they screwed up by giving you that $100 a month for.

1052
01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:12.220
P27: you know, 10 years they're gonna want it all back

1053
01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:25.240
P27: that fast, even though it was their screw up. And that's the problem. So in a situation like this, if you're signing for somebody and saying they're here, and you and the Va. Starts providing it, and then they find out that they're not.

1054
01:26:26.060 --> 01:26:31.710
P27: You know? Do they go after the caregiver? Do they go after the veteran? Where does it go? You know

1055
01:26:32.282 --> 01:26:37.719
P27: and sadly, it's it's 1 of those things that people are gonna do that kind of stuff. And

1056
01:26:37.980 --> 01:26:48.209
P27: you know, honestly, that's why what we were talking about earlier. If I was doing this with a veteran as a Vso. I would not fill out a spouse's information

1057
01:26:48.350 --> 01:26:50.090
P27: unless I had the spouse

1058
01:26:50.170 --> 01:26:59.939
P27: on the phone, and and they were fully cognizant that I'm using their name and status, etc, etc. I just would not blindly give it to somebody, because

1059
01:26:59.980 --> 01:27:02.839
P27: we're putting our butts on the line

1060
01:27:03.430 --> 01:27:06.029
P27: by saying, Yeah, this is the case. You know what I'm saying.

1061
01:27:06.570 --> 01:27:08.430
Moderator: Gotcha. Okay.

1062
01:27:08.750 --> 01:27:12.020
P27: That make, and that's something we gotta do to to protect ourselves.

1063
01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:13.130
Moderator: Yeah.

1064
01:27:13.650 --> 01:27:23.129
Moderator: thank you. So since this is a testing site, we won't be able to actually submit. But what would you expect to happen next. If you hit, submit application.

1065
01:27:23.390 --> 01:27:27.979
P27: If I hit submit application, I would expect a response email.

1066
01:27:28.954 --> 01:27:31.559
P27: saying that it has been submitted.

1067
01:27:33.890 --> 01:27:47.389
P27: and it's waiting the award, or whatever to be reviewed, or to be appointment to be set, or whatever whatever the next step in the in the issuance of the process would be, I would expect an email to go to the veteran

1068
01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:58.840
P27: and to the primary caregiver and secondary. So whoever's email is on there saying that this is actually taking place, they should receive an email

1069
01:27:58.980 --> 01:28:01.329
P27: stating that this has been submitted

1070
01:28:01.450 --> 01:28:04.900
P27: so that they know it's just as a double check, so that

1071
01:28:05.070 --> 01:28:05.850
P27: you know.

1072
01:28:05.970 --> 01:28:07.030
P27: the wife

1073
01:28:07.514 --> 01:28:14.069
P27: knows that her name, or the spouse, or the neighbor, or the son. Whoever knows that this has been submitted in their name.

1074
01:28:14.210 --> 01:28:20.480
P27: you know. Cause again. That's just a that's a checks and balances self protection thing for folks.

1075
01:28:20.490 --> 01:28:23.940
P27: If I put my neighbor's name in there and I don't tell my neighbor.

1076
01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:25.130
P27: you.

1077
01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:30.189
P27: Yeah, he's gonna get a check, and he's gonna be like, what the hell is this for? And etc, etc.

1078
01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:36.079
P27: You know it. It's just not cool, and he may not be. He may not be responsive to that.

1079
01:28:36.450 --> 01:28:37.340
P27: you know.

1080
01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:38.180
Moderator: Yeah.

1081
01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:40.390
P27: So. And and it's not.

1082
01:28:41.900 --> 01:28:43.039
P27: It's not

1083
01:28:43.430 --> 01:28:51.300
P27: so bad in that situation, because that, I think, is a little more questionable that way. But within the household.

1084
01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:53.259
P27: I think it would be.

1085
01:28:53.630 --> 01:28:54.480
P27: You know.

1086
01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:57.999
P27: my wife and I. We we have

1087
01:28:58.390 --> 01:29:06.019
P27: 100% financial control over everything. We share everything. I know a lot of couples that they don't. His money's his hers. Money is hers.

1088
01:29:06.030 --> 01:29:09.369
P27: This money is designed for her

1089
01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:13.809
P27: as a compensation for assisting the veteran.

1090
01:29:13.970 --> 01:29:21.869
P27: you know, or my neighbor with gas for hauling me around, or whatever. Okay, it's, you know, it's not for the veterans. So

1091
01:29:21.900 --> 01:29:24.740
P27: that that's why I say, if you just let the veteran know.

1092
01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:31.330
P27: you know, somewhere down the line somebody could say, well, you're getting this from them, and they're going. What the hell you talking about? So.

1093
01:29:31.790 --> 01:29:32.430
Moderator: Yeah.

1094
01:29:32.630 --> 01:29:33.490
Moderator: okay.

1095
01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:36.230
Moderator: I'm gonna stop the screen sharing.

1096
01:29:36.530 --> 01:29:40.190
P27: This Zoom Meeting window. This meeting is being recorded.

1097
01:29:40.620 --> 01:29:44.260
Moderator: Okay, I just have a couple of final questions, and then we're all done.

1098
01:29:44.260 --> 01:29:44.880
P27: Shoot.

1099
01:29:45.458 --> 01:29:52.680
Moderator: So now that you've seen the form, what research do you think you would have wanted to do before filling it out?

1100
01:29:53.950 --> 01:29:54.850
Moderator: If any.

1101
01:29:55.220 --> 01:29:55.930
P27: None.

1102
01:29:56.520 --> 01:29:57.130
Moderator: Okay.

1103
01:29:57.280 --> 01:30:02.650
P27: None cause the form has exact. I'm not gonna run down rabbit holes trying to get something I don't need.

1104
01:30:03.010 --> 01:30:08.020
P27: That form is saying. This is what you will need to do this, and I think that's a good call.

1105
01:30:08.690 --> 01:30:09.390
Moderator: Okay.

1106
01:30:09.390 --> 01:30:15.430
P27: At least, I expect, because again, I didn't go to those links. But I I suspect the way the forms written. You've got everything you would need

1107
01:30:16.127 --> 01:30:18.830
P27: and like, I say, the good thing is

1108
01:30:19.150 --> 01:30:29.309
P27: with the power of attorneys, and the 2122. That's really good information. I I highly suspect that it's on all those different links as far as what would be needed. So

1109
01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:36.969
P27: my advice if somebody calls me up and says, hey? If I'm doing this, read through it. Go to all the links, get what you need. Don't worry about the stuff. You don't need.

1110
01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:38.950
Moderator: Okay, Gotcha.

1111
01:30:38.970 --> 01:30:45.740
Moderator: what were your thoughts about the amount of information that was provided in the form? Did you think it was too much too little, or just enough.

1112
01:30:46.210 --> 01:30:47.030
P27: Perfect.

1113
01:30:48.110 --> 01:30:48.730
Moderator: Okay.

1114
01:30:49.110 --> 01:30:56.569
Moderator: is there any additional information about who qualifies to be a primary or a secondary caregiver that you would have liked to have in this form.

1115
01:30:57.360 --> 01:30:58.020
P27: No.

1116
01:30:58.270 --> 01:31:00.166
P27: no, I think that's

1117
01:31:00.930 --> 01:31:06.769
P27: But the only thing I would say that you might want to put in there is, and I suspect it's somewhere else.

1118
01:31:07.050 --> 01:31:14.840
P27: as far as who qualifies to be a primary caregivers, it's got to be somebody with the veteran. It can't be like. Say, it can't be my son in Germany, you know.

1119
01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:18.070
Moderator: Okay, gotcha

1120
01:31:18.710 --> 01:31:29.160
Moderator: alright, that's all the questions that I had for you. I just want to circle back and reconfirm. Are you comfortable? If we decided to use a recorded clip of this session removing any identifying information.

1121
01:31:29.850 --> 01:31:31.680
P27: That is 100% fine.

1122
01:31:32.060 --> 01:31:33.170
Moderator: Okay. Great.

1123
01:31:33.621 --> 01:31:46.270
Moderator: Alright. Well, that's it. I appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. This has been really, really helpful, and we will continue working on this form and making sure it's working as well as it can for veterans and caregivers.

1124
01:31:46.270 --> 01:31:50.929
P27: Yeah, this this is really, I gotta tell you this is one of the best ones out there

1125
01:31:51.020 --> 01:31:53.325
P27: that I've been with on this

1126
01:31:54.210 --> 01:31:56.719
P27: truly is, you guys really did a great job on this one.

1127
01:31:57.300 --> 01:31:58.560
Moderator: Okay, thank you.

1128
01:31:58.939 --> 01:32:10.609
Moderator: Lastly, Perig, and that's the company that invited you to this session. They'll be sending you a thank you. Note with a blurb that you can pass along. If you know any other veterans or caregivers that would want to participate in studies like this.

1129
01:32:11.330 --> 01:32:13.849
P27: Yeah, I I actually send those out quite often.

1130
01:32:14.250 --> 01:32:17.360
Moderator: You probably told everybody you can't.

1131
01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:22.210
P27: Yeah, yeah, like, I say, this is, this has been so long needed.

1132
01:32:22.220 --> 01:32:28.449
P27: And you have cleared up. And really, I think you're this right here is going to be so much

1133
01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:30.249
P27: help and assistance

1134
01:32:30.912 --> 01:32:32.840
P27: with this program, because.

1135
01:32:32.950 --> 01:32:35.409
P27: again, like, I say, one of the biggest

1136
01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:40.729
P27: stumbling blocks that we've had roadblocks that we've had is the Va Vha

1137
01:32:40.850 --> 01:32:46.029
P27: not willing to speak to the Vba and Vsos, you know.

1138
01:32:46.270 --> 01:33:02.610
P27: and and you know, literally telling us that the power of attorneys, that that one line right there, that that is acceptable is going to be one of the biggest game changers for us, because we will now be able to go back and hammer the Vha and say, Here it is. If you don't like this.

1139
01:33:02.740 --> 01:33:09.200
P27: then you need to go to Vaco and and fix it. Okay? Because Vaco is saying, it's acceptable.

1140
01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:19.429
Moderator: Okay. Just so, you know, that is, live in the form. Now, that's not really like that's not something we were keeping, you know, to test, and not.

1141
01:33:19.670 --> 01:33:20.450
P27: Yeah.

1142
01:33:20.450 --> 01:33:21.730
Moderator: Actually, yeah, it is live.

1143
01:33:22.090 --> 01:33:26.400
P27: Yeah. And and like, I say, it's it's been a while, cause honestly with everything

1144
01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:28.370
P27: until

1145
01:33:28.780 --> 01:33:31.659
P27: until it's signed by the President.

1146
01:33:31.930 --> 01:33:43.720
P27: we we're still recommending. Folks don't even bother putting anything in, because the new rules for the blindness, although everybody agrees to when there's approved and and everything else until it gets that signature.

1147
01:33:43.740 --> 01:33:45.430
P27: It doesn't mean anything.

1148
01:33:45.530 --> 01:33:47.730
P27: you know. They're still sitting there saying.

1149
01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:52.780
P27: you know, you can dress yourself. Well, yeah, I can. I just can't, you know.

1150
01:33:53.050 --> 01:33:55.710
P27: dress myself correctly, or whatever you know.

1151
01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:56.465
Moderator: Absolutely.

1152
01:33:56.930 --> 01:33:57.910
P27: Totally. Understand?

1153
01:33:58.130 --> 01:33:58.970
P27: Yeah.

1154
01:33:59.280 --> 01:33:59.750
Moderator: Alright

1155
01:34:00.380 --> 01:34:03.089
Moderator: so much, Tracy, it was really great chatting with you.

1156
01:34:03.090 --> 01:34:03.970
P27: Me, too.

1157
01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:08.110
P27: Thank you. Thank you for the opportunity. It's great.

1158
01:34:08.230 --> 01:34:11.422
P27: Keep up the good work. I'll let you know if I can get back in on, on these.

1159
01:34:11.700 --> 01:34:13.090
P27: certainly. Look forward to it.

1160
01:34:13.340 --> 01:34:17.530
Moderator: Great. I'm sure we're gonna we're gonna be needing you a lot.

1161
01:34:18.140 --> 01:34:22.459
P27: But you got my contact information. And and if you need my

1162
01:34:22.792 --> 01:34:30.100
P27: if you need to contact me on the whole issue with the Mac OS or the the you know the OS system there, because I don't know on the

1163
01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:36.893
P27: Ipad OS or Ios, but the Mac OS, the the troubles and trials that we had with the

1164
01:34:37.340 --> 01:34:47.620
P27: quick nav and and the situation. I mean, you saw what was going on there with those things as far as where it's navigating to but if you want to follow up on any of those.

1165
01:34:47.700 --> 01:34:51.719
P27: drop, drop me a line I can. I could work through it and test it out for you and everything like, say.

1166
01:34:51.770 --> 01:34:55.530
P27: just for your own situational awareness. I am working with

1167
01:34:55.860 --> 01:34:59.669
P27: Apple to get this thing fixed, but I've been working on it with Apple for

1168
01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:03.209
P27: probably 7 months now, trying to get this thing fixed.

1169
01:35:03.410 --> 01:35:04.230
P27: So

1170
01:35:04.350 --> 01:35:07.790
P27: you know, if you're struggling or you have those struggles on your end.

1171
01:35:07.950 --> 01:35:12.139
P27: Just be aware it may not be you. It may be Mac OS doing it.

1172
01:35:12.180 --> 01:35:14.250
P27: The app is working fine, so.

1173
01:35:14.690 --> 01:35:19.609
Moderator: Thank you. It was so helpful to see. And have you explain it all? Really appreciate it?

1174
01:35:19.950 --> 01:35:21.760
P27: Cool no sweat.

1175
01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:23.859
Moderator: See, have a great rest of your day.

1176
01:35:23.860 --> 01:35:27.220
P27: Thank you, you, too. Be safe. You, too. Bye, bye.
