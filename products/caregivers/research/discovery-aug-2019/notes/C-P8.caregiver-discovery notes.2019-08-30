#2019-08-30 Caregiver P8 NOTES#

*See [conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/research/discovery-aug-2019/caregiver-conversation-guide.md) for questions.*

Just give me 2secs to check on my dad, and then I'll be with you the whole hour.
My father will be 96, he's a veteran, and I just needed to make sure he'd be okay.
And now you'll have some history on my dad, he's severely disabled from combat. He's going to be 96, so we're happy about that. 
My mom was a veteran too. Before she passed, I was a caregiver for her.

I'm, okay, I've been a caregiver a long time. My training, my occupation before I retired was a speech language pathologist. I have my masters. My knowledge from my education has made me a better caregiver. Now I'm in CITYB, half the year in CITYA, half in BITYB. The weather is better in the summer, bc we're missing hurricane Doria. 

I learned later in life, I'm ##. In #### I got my first computer… in high school we learned basic fortran right, which was not fun. I have an iPhone, iPad, … I'm a really good researcher. Anything I need to find.  When I want an answer to something I will persevere. When I want to find something out, I will go and further research, on netscape or any of the other … like my dad has ####, I went online and researched, and got the va to buy him a $6k ###### machine. I presented on the va caregivers support line, my story, and it took me 60 Hours to write. It's about having 2 parents who are veterans,###########

Not for me, but when I go into my healthevet my dad gets an internal error, and I let them know but they haven't been able to fix it. It's still not fixed. I let the person in CITYB -- CITYA, when I was in STATEA, I duplicated the error, screenshot it, and sent it in, and as of 10 days ago it still wasn't fixed. So I tell them to send it to my chart, bc I have a chart, and it works.

Pre-911 don't get any benefits.

A little bit of bkgd info. My father is rated 70% for ####. 

########### He didn't start getting help until 2006. [lots more]

He was rated at 60%, so there was not enough $ to support a family of # children… #####

Sometime in 2011 he finally got his 100% rating… so all that time we didn't get any benefits, [more info]

A c-file is a record, a claim file, with all the documentation from when you start filing… […] 

That's when he purged everything that occurred. Then he told me, and I typed everything word for word. He went from a 10% rating for #### and something… to a 100% for #### and ##########. There is an appeals process, but… you know, if you're at 100% they can always take it away. You never know if you should stir the pot, you may make it worse than it was.

I know there's 3 different tiers, based on the level of care, based on what they'll pay you, times the amount of care you need. It's not age, they say my father is entitled to 48 hours of home health aide. We won't use a home health aid bc they've stolen from us. They pay $24 / hour, $8 to the agency, $13 to the aid. Heard thru fb pages, … in … I took the course through the va… […] so at this point I'm resigned to the fact we can't get a lot of stuff, bc we're pre-911… a lot of stuff is for post-911.  A lot of stuff we're not allowed to partake of. I've come to the realization congress did this not my fellow caregivers.

I would call my caregiver support coordinator for the form and what I needed to support. Or I'd call the va caregiver support line and get resources.

Well, if I was going to do this, bc a lot of my fb friends, they keep a diary of what they're doing. That's really helpful if you need to present the need and see… here's what my day consisted of. So I just checked to see if his line was … it's a constant job, over 100 hrs a week for me. It's assisting with bathing, feeding, dressing, making sure he's eating, taking his meds, taking his blood pressure, … my father has #######, everything has to be prepared so he doesn't choke. You're going to have to write a book on this! I've given you so much. My dad's doctor doesn't want anything published until after he passes. Bc of the ptsd, he doesn't want him triggered. 

*[missed lots]*
I've seen it.

I've read it, but I'm not entitled to it. 

I look up everything that I can. This would take me 2 seconds to fill out.

I would type it in. Print it out. I do that all he time (fill out father's info and my info).

He'll sign after I print it out. I also have vpoa since my mother passed. 

I would bring it in in person since we're at the va a cal times a month. Or I would scan it in and email it to XXXXX.  If I scan it I have a time date stamped. so I would in essence have a receipt. Caregiver Support Coordinator.

I would wait to hear if I was accepted into the program. Hopefully it would be an affirmative answer. I think 20 calendar days, which is a month, w/b reasonable, and then there would be followup. It could be an unperson visit, email, phone call. A lot of caregivers are keeping journals, what they do, who they spoke to, they keep a log. 

A phone call followed up with a written letter. Bc this way I have written documentation. 

A home visit (after learning of approval). I would hope the va would give me expectations of what I'm already doing, and then I would get benefits wohich would be even nicer.

I could ask for an appeal.

I think there's a form that tells you how to do it. I haven't had to do it so I haven't looked it up. I would prob call the cs line and ask where I would go to find the appeals process.

Va caregivers support website under the va.gov website

Va post 911 caregiver program application

Haven't had to do it, but I really don't see a problem.

Oh, yeah, I basically… he hasn't gone on the computer in a really long time. So I go in and check his chart notes. I was checking appts making sure they were put in. I check on his prescriptions. There was a prob when we were in STATEA I didn't see his STATEB primary care. There's a problem with secure msg. There's a problem with myhealthevet it does not show [xxxxxx] … [something I couldn't capture]

I can call the rx line, and when I call there's an option to press for appts.

Every va has its own personality. I mean, he has good care in both facilities. 

Actually CITYA has parking. CITYB va has no parking. CITYA has wheelchairs. At CITYB it's impossible. CITYA has meetings once/mo, CITYB has nothing.

Omg all the resources I did when I presented my caregivers support w/b amazing. I ike resources. I like chats, has chats a cal times/wk. the one in ny has … it's amazing. Anything… would be great. [missed stuff]

We need more mental health. I have mental health thru video from web and the skills they've given me have made it easier … also tools for caregiver burnout and stress. 

Military veteran caregiver network that's through the Red Cross they have meetings multiple times…

Building better caregivers… through va, 

Easter seal

#### #### has my resource list. I wish you had my resource list. The ptsd is impacting all the family members, it's affecting multi generational and there aren't enough …
I just hope I see this before my father passes. I mean… he's almost 96 years old. 

City Open Arms for Caregivers. 

I need as a caregiver mental health benefits. This job is hard.
