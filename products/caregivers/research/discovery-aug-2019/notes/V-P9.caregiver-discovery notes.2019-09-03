See [conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/research/discovery-aug-2019/veteran-conversation-guide.md)

M: Would you tell me a little bit about yourself?
P: I’m in City, State. 

M: You’re a veteran?
P:  Yes

M: Branch?
P: Army

M: What did you do?
P: I came in as a medic and came out as a supply sergeant

M: How long have you been in State?
P: Just moved here in February from City. It’s cheaper to live in State than City. I have 30% unemployability so I had to find a place to live 

M: About technology. Would you consider yourself pretty tech-savvy?
P: I used to be a buyer for aero electronics. I used to be pretty tech-savvy

M: Do you use computers, smart phones, or tablets?
P: I have computers, smart phone, tablets. I have never played a computer game

M: What kinds of computers and such do you have?
P: I have a surface pro, iPhone. That’s about it I guess

M: Do you use any assistive technology with these devices?
P: No not really. I zoom my text up. Especially with phone

M: Do you do maybe any voice to text sort of things?
P: I used to on my iPhone. I still have a ##### accent so the words wouldn’t translate well. Sometimes it’s more accurate than with auto correct

M: Can you tell me a little about your Caregiver? Do they live with you?
P: No, not any more

M: Can you tell me more?
P: I used to have a Caregiver in City. I felt like there were more days when I was functional than not functional. It became kind of annoying. Like micromanaging. They were adding too much structure 

M: Did you try to talk with them about that and try to adjust it?
P: No, not really. It was just easier for me to just not participate in the program 

M: What were some of the services they helped you with before?
P: Mostly making sure I was eating well, getting up, taking showers. Just the daily things people do normally. Because I’m an insomniac I wouldn’t necessarily getting up at 8 am and getting everything done. My rest was my priority. If I got my rest then I’d be able to do everything else I’d need to get done. 

M: Did your Caregiver receive benefits from the VA?
P: No

M: So it was a Caregiver on your own?
P: Yes

M: what do you know about the VA’s Caregiver benefits?
P: I know they have them, and I understood that, uh, during the Trump administration they had dropped quite a bit of the Caregiver roles out of the budget. I didn’t really find it in me to fight that, at that time 

M: What did you know about what they were about?
P: Just that they would help out with doctors’ appointments, making sure you got to them. I took it more of a medical avenue and helping out with daily household stuff

M: How did you find out about the program?
P: I think through facebook postings

M: If you had a caregiver in your life and you wanted to receive benefits, how would you apply for that?
P: I would go through the VA. I think you can go through E-Benefits and do it is my understanding. 

M: What steps do you think may be involved?
P: I would go with my primary care physician 

M: And why?
P: First of all my primary care here is wonderful. She would know whether the Caregiver would benefit me or not. And maybe she would have other solutions for me 

M: How would you find out if your Caregiver was eligible?
P: I have no idea. I guess through my primary care. I would probably research it on the internet. On the qualifications

M: If you were to complete this application, how would you expect to find out about its status?
P: Probably E-Benefits or VA.GOV site 

M: How long do you think it would take to see if application was approved or denied?
P: Probably 6 months

M: Is that how long you’d want it to take?
P: No

M: How long would you prefer?
P: At most 60 days. I think if you’re applying for a Caregiver, you really need one.

M: If you learned the application was approved, what would you expect to happen next?
P: A social worker should probably reach out with the guidance of finding a Caregiver. I wouldn’t have a family Caregiver 

M: Are you involved with anything like VSO or DAV or American Legion or any Veteran organizations?
P: No

M: Is there a reason why you tend to stay away from them?
P: I’ve never used them for anything

M: What about the social media versions of them?
P: No

M: If you learned the application was denied, what would you expect the next steps would be? How would you want to know?
P: Appeal. Known through a VSO

M: If you were going to complete this application, would you prefer to complete it online or print it?
P: Oh, online.

M: Why?
P: Well, there’s an electronic footprint then 

M: Is there any other way you may prefer to apply?
P: No

M: How do you feel about sharing your personal information with VA.GOV as part of the process?
P: They already have it

M: How would you feel about having a Caregiver manage online medication/dr appointments for you?
P: I would be okay with it. I think there should be a check and balance for that. If someone was in charge of my prescriptions, I would need to be notified somehow that this prescription is cancelled, delayed, etc. That shows up on a report, controlled substance report, which would effect even if I had to see a civilian doctor. 

M: Would you be at all interested in finding a Caregiver if your symptoms became a little more troublesome?
P: Yes

M: If you could design what that looked like. Like, you don’t have a family member that could care for you. What does that look like?
P: I think it would be the same process as it would doing it through social security. 

M: They have a program?
P: I thought so. I think my grandmother had one"

M: If there was an online space for Caregivers to sign in to access tools and resources, what do you think a Caregiver would want to find there?
P: I think they should be able to have the same view as me, but not necessarily not the same access to certain things like prescriptions. I don’t really care.. they would have to follow HIPAA rules. I don’t care if they have access to information as long as they can’t change that information or if they have contact with any of my doctors I am also copied on that

M: When you had a Caregiver, are there any services your Caregiver could have needed to do a better job?
P: No, not that I was aware of. 

M: Is there anything else you’d like to share with me today?
P: Not that I can think of.
