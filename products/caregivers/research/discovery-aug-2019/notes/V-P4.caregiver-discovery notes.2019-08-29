#Veteran P4 NOTES#

See [conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/research/discovery-aug-2019/veteran-conversation-guide.md)

M: Tell me a little about yourself
P4: I am going to be [##] next month, and I served in the US Army. And I believe the VA has not lived up to its part as far as taking care of its Veterans 

M: Very sorry to hear that. Hopefully our work will help with that. That’s what I’m here for. Can you tell me where you are located?
P4: Relatively remote city, state 

M: Which branch were you in?
P4: US Army

M: Pre or Post/911?
P4: Pre 9/11. Vietnam 

M: Can you tell me a little about your experience with technology? Computers, smart phones, tablets, etc
P4: I am good with the computer and the cell phone. As far as video games, I don’t play them very often. I use a computer for information purposes to do research and try to keep up with today’s news that I can actually believe. 

M: I wonder if you play video games with any children that are your relatives. Perhaps you have some exposure to them
P4: No, I don’t do any as far as dealing with other people online. Not game-wise 

M: there are ways in which you deal with others online?
P4: Like on Rallypoint which is a site that has Veterans and Active Duty. We communicate through messages. 

M: Do you use FB?
P4: I use FB, but I have a very small pool of people that I deal with there. And again, we do it through messages. 

M: Do you use any sort of assistive technology. Like, increasing the font size or a special mouse, hearing device, anything at all?
P4: This is drag and speak microphone that I have on. And drag and speak types for me because I have arthritis in both hands. So, it’s kind of hard to use the keyboard to respond. Drag and speak being an adaptive technology gives me the choice to do larger fonts, goes into Microsoft Word. So, yeah. It’s available and I do use it quite often. 

M: Do you use a special mouse at all?
P4: It’s just a regular mouse, but I am able to at least lay my fingers on it where they need to be and click where I need to

M: Have you ever encountered an interface with a mouse that you found difficult to use?
P4: There is a couple of games put out by Playteka (sp). It is a little difficult to keep clicking the mouse. I found that if I hold it down long enough, it’ll give me the option to spin 100 times or whatever. 

M: Have you ever tried to click something on the interface and something went wrong?
P4: I’ve had that problem, and there is an X in the upper right corner and I use that quite often. 

M: Do you recall a time where that happened?
P4: Uhm, I think it was like last Tuesday or Thursday that it happened. I am not a patient person when it comes to the computer doing this. So I go ahead and exit out and move to another project

M: Have you had that experience on a VA site?
P4: I’ve had it once recently on My Healthy Vet. 

M: Do you remember what the situation was?
P4: I was trying to reorder medication through the pharmacy. It just kept spinning and wouldn’t connect or something. Finally, I just said, “Forget it!” So it does happen on that site once in a while. 

M: Did you get the medication you needed?
P4: Yes

M: When you encounter these sorts of interactions, you’re thankful for the closeout button?
P4: The closeout is my friend

M: Do you currently have a caregiver?
P4: My ex-wife lives with me. She basically is my caregiver. Even though the VA wouldn’t approve her. They said I don’t need one in their estimation, so. 

M: What are some of the biggest challenges you and your Caregiver face?
P4: Well, i think the biggest challenge for both of us she has cancer. It zaps her strength to deal with me even though she’s going through chemo and stuff. We manage our daily lives as best we can. We manage. We’re doing fairly well. Some days are better than others. This is an easier day. I was able to get up easy and get moving around so that helps. 

M: Your caregiver currently receives no benefits, but you did apply?
P4: Right

M: What do you know about the Caregiver Benefits?
P4: It was very vague. I was told by a DAV rep here in town that I should apply for it. They did the paperwork, and I got the denial. That was that. They’re gonna deny it out of pocket like they normally do, so we’ll forget about it. 

M: How did you find out about the program?
P4: Through the DAV 

M: When you you received your denial, did you see if there was an option to appeal?
P4: No, I had dealt with the VA with compensation, and pension, and they denied, denied, denied. Finally, they granted a small pension. They just said they didn’t need it. That was their decision.

M: Was the process for applying straightforward? 
P4: As far as I know it was. Like I said, I had the DAV do the paperwork.

M: It sounds like you may not have a lot of insight into the steps involved in the process. What do you think would be the logical steps in this process?
P4: Having experience with the VA like I do: Fill out the forms, send it in, and wait and wait and wait.

M: If you could decide what happened, what would you make happen
P4: You fill out the form, you submit it, it’s reviewed within 15-30 days. Then, it goes over to a physician. The physician would have the say whether the Caregiver is necessary or not.

M: How would you feel about a home visit as part of the approval process?
P4: That would be ideal for most of us Veterans, ya know? That they come out and actually see. Housing is different for each person. Thank goodness we live in a small house, manufactured home. Everything is convenient. But, sometimes it’s hard to get down the hallway because it’s narrow *laughs*. But it would be nice for someone to do a home visit and actually see. 

MJ: Do you remember signing the form?
P4: Yes

M: Can you tell me how you did that?
P4: I sat at his computer. It was streamlined. Somehow he had a “sign in file” or something like that.

M: So the DAV has some utility where you signed on the computer?
P4: Yes. Docu-Sign is the name of it. 

M: So you didn’t sign a print-out paper form 
P4: No I didn’t 

M: I’m going to share my screen now, and see if you recognize this form. Does this look familiar to you? I’m going to scroll down a bit.
P4: Okay… the CG 10-10. 

M: Does this look familiar?
P4: Yes

M: We’re going to talk about an ideal state rather than what you experienced. Once you fill out the form, how would you like to find out about status?
P4: I would first have an email and then a followup by ‘snail mail’

M: You would have an email, meaning you would receive an email? And they’d send a letter?
P4: Right, that way you have notification two ways. If you miss one you have the other. 

M: You told me 15 days for review and then additional review. How long would it take to receive approval or denial?
P4: 45 days. 4-6 weeks 

M: If you learned you were approved, what would be the next steps
P4: That, I don’t know. If I designed it, they would designate the person as a Caregiver. Then, they’d do whatever compensation or whatever. Then it would be in place until the end of time! *laughs*

M: In your circumstances, when the application was denied, what should it have been like?
P4: Personally, I believe it should have been approved. The Caregiver should be able to receive compensation.

M: Well, we’re talking how things go. Not everyone is going to approved at least the first time. If there’s going to be a denial, what would you like to see happen next?
P4: Appeal process where they would review what has been submitted and actually do a face-to-face interview with the people involved rather than do a paper review. 

M: And then?
P4: And then take in consideration the physicians decision why they feel the Caregiver is necessary. Then, go ahead and approve it.

M: If you could pick anything, where would you want to go to apply for Caregiver benefits?
P4: It should be at the local VA clinic. Because we do not have a hospital down here. We just have a community-based outreach clinic. 

M: Are there areas that don’t have VA clinics available to your knowledge?
P4: I believe because we are in the [geographic region], we’re lucky to have the clinic. We have the Marine Force Air Station in City. In between here and [geographic region], I mean, those people have to travel long distances to get to a clinic. 

M: So, if it was possible to apply for the Caregiver program online, where would you expect to go do that?
P4: If it was available on a home computer where you could do it, it would be much simpler. 

M: Yes. So if you could fill it out online, where would you expect to have a link to go to it?
P4: Uhm, I would expect it to be available on My Healthy Vet. Or, at least one of the VA websites. 

M: And if you had to search for it, what are some terms you might look for
P4: VA Caregiver, I think would be one of the simplest. 

M: Any other?
P4: Help! *laughs* But like I said

M: Would you prefer to complete application or filling out a paper form? Why?
P4: The VA in my experience has a way of saying, “Oh, we never received it! Did you mail it?” And when you answer, “Yes!” they say, “Oh, it must be in our mailroom. We’ll get it sometime!” So, electronically would be better. 

M: Any other way? 
P4: I would design it where you can actually get an electronic receipt or acknowledgment that the VA actually got the form. They’re bad about acknowledging such things. It’s about accountability. “This is the date we have it”. That way it would tell you how much time is tolling

M: If you received a time stamp for each step, would those time stamps be what you’re talking about?
P4: Yes, so that way you have some documentation to show what’s actually happening instead of sitting and wondering if they got it, what are they doing with it. The pension and compensation applications sit. They get sent to Wisconsin, then regional offices. It’s an unncessecary step

M: How do you feel about sharing personal information with VA?
P4: They’ve got it all already! *laughs*

M: Currently vets can access benefits such a prescriptions and healthcare appointments online at VA.gov. How do you feel about a Caregiver managing them for you?
P4: That would be ideal if it came to it. Once you do the POA, they can do that pretty much.

M: If we created an online space for Caregivers to sign in, get help and tools, what do you think would be there?
P4: I would hope everything that I would be able to access, the Caregiver would be able to access.

M: Is there anything else you’d like to tell me about?
P4: About, the VA? 

M: Uhm, so, it would be about this process. But because you have so many insights, I wanted to leave the question open so we can capture your experience so we may be able to help you. If there’s anything you wanted to say I’m here to hear you
P4: What I want to say is, the VA needs to build a hospital down here because we are in a remote area. We have to go to city for major healthcare treatment. It’s a 3, 3.5 hour drive to city. It’s 3 hours to other city where there’s a VA, and 2.5 hours to other city. The thing is we can’t use city VA because it’s in State. It’s not the [geographic region] VA are. We can’t use City because it’s not [geographic region] VA. We’re stuck going to City like for my cardiology appointments I have to drive all the way to city just to see a cardiologist for 15-20 min at most.

M: So everything you do related to your Veteran healthcare has to go through a VA facility? 
P4: Down here, a Veteran’s choice does not work well. For example, I have a disk that’s messed up in my back. I was having severe shooting pains into my head and stuff. I went to the VA clinic, and they said they don’t see people on an emergency basis. This was when the new community outreach bill came into effect. I went over to the Urgent Care facility. I gave the girl my VA card and she said, “You have to have prior authorization to come here”. So I ended up going to the local emergency room, spending about 6 hours there. They said, “Oh, go see your VA doctor.” And I say, “Okay, what good is the VA clinic if they’re not going to see people.” It just doesn’t work out down here.

M: I’m sorry
P4: It’s not just me, it’s all veterans down here. Some as old as 85 years old that served in Korea. This clinic for some reason has problems to the point where you’ll live until you die and it sounds like, “I hope you die soon because you’re a burden to us.” It’s sad.

Yes
M: Would you like to share this opportunity on Rallypoint?
P4: I got here from Rallypoint. We have people from Baltimore, Germany, Australia. Wherever there’s a military base with Veterans and Active Duty we complain and share ideas. But, when we send them to our elected officials *giggles* as they may be, they kind of fall on deaf years. Veterans seem to be the low priority with most of our Senators and Congressmen. They’re letter writers, not action takers. 

M: Would you like us to share a blurb for you to share to anyone else you know?
P4: Yes ma’am, please.
