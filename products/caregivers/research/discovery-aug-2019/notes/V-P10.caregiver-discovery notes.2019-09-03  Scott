#Veteran P10 NOTES#

See [conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/research/discovery-aug-2019/veteran-conversation-guide.md)

My name's #####, I'm 100% disabled, a veteran, and I live with my caregiver.

I was in the air force, I was aircraft maintenance and munition acquisition.
Now I live in City, State. I lived everywhere with the military. When I needed a caregiver that's where my parent were and were I went.

I'm pretty tech savvy.  I have a macbook air. I have an Apple 10r, I also have an iPad.

I use the zoom up text, big letters and contrast colors.  I go under in settings under accessibility. It makes it so the word and the text stand out better. It's under Accessibility.

laughter.

Sometimes I'll challenges with my hands actually holding the phone and the iPad so I have all kinds of little cases with clips and stands.  Thats why I went with iPhone 10R so I can log in on my face.

I have left side weakness, on my left hand, and pain in my hands.

It can get, when my hands are really bad I'll do talk to text instead and use that. 

Sometimes I have to use the little pen that comes with it.

Sometimes my fingers will spasm and I'll double tap stuff on the screen. I don't have problems with things being too close together bc I kind of pick at it, I don't really use the proper hand movement for typing or anything. It's just if I have a finger, y'know the one finger typing, and then it'll just double clicks.

Trackpad on air: I actually like it because you can set it to where it ignores your double clicks. I like that you have that setting. There's also a long push so it's like, "no, really, I want this."

My Mom is my primary caregiver, with my Dad being the backup. Mostly, though, it's my mom does all the hard labor. Hehe, she's fabulous.

I'm really weather sensitive, heat sensitive, so I can't cook. My mom cooks for me, does the cleaning and stuff when I can't get out of bed because of the pain. On real bad hand days she's had to feed me. Drives me where I need to go. I mean, she does everything! I don't know what she doesn't do. Dad is moral support! He doesn't cook, but he will go out and get food! LOL

Challenges: One of the things that we encountered, that we had problems with is there being space for me in the house. When I moved back, my parents had to build onto the house to make room for me. I was living on my own, had my own household, and then when you add in my old household stuff plus all the medical equipment, and my service dog, then you have all the service dog equipment. It makes for a little tight… sorry, I said service dog and my service dog let out a grunt. LOL We had our first foray into the VA today. I just got my service dog. We take our public access test at the end of this month. We're doing the at-home training part, so today was the VA and that's always interesting.

The VA is, it's hard to… I mean, it's just huge. So it's hard to maneuver, and… the Michael E Debakey medical center. Sometimes it's hard to just actually get into the VA.  Just getting my wheelchair down, out of the car, putting it together, and so that in and of itself is a hassle.  I have a power-assisted wheelchair so it's a little heavy, and I have a chairlift but it's become unreliable.

Just last week — was it last week or the week before? I can't remember. It broke at the VA and my mom and I were sitting in the parking lot, like, now what? We had to call, my mom had to call the OIF/OEF social worker to get her to order a wheelchair escort, to get the escort to come out to the car. It was such a hassle, I was so late to my appointment.

Does your caregiver currently receive benefits?  Yes, my mom gets a little stipend. My dad is on there, I believe, but the only one that gets a stipend is my mom. 

Once a month they have a class that they go to.  It's more like a get together than a class. That's it, actually. 

Actually it was one of the social workers told my mom about it, and my mom went and did the research, finding out more, and where to go. One of the challenges is they don't actually pay for her for all that she does. I mean, it's like it's limited. We try to explain, I mean my mom is next to me 24/7.  I mean, she is right there. What do you need, Baby? What can I do for you? How are you feeling today? She comes checks on me at night and if I'm having  bad muscle spasms she'll actually massage my legs while I'm asleep having bad spasms. I mean she does all this stuff for me, cooking, cleaning, besides me actually dressing myself, my mom does mostly everything else.

I wasn't much involved. My mom did most of the work, almost all, like 95%, applying for it, finding out what documentation they needed, getting the documentation from me, and did the application.

I feel like they shortchange her and they don't give her what she needs for what all she's doing. Because I mean, it's a full-time job. She can't work, she's taking care of me. 
I think she's like tier 2.  I think the tiers are confusing, on what qualifies you for what tier, and don't think they fairly represent the work that the person does. It's just not all inclusive for what she does. I mean, they pay her for my memory issues, not necessarily for all my mental health needs, not all the physical health stuff that I need.

We told my Dr, my physician, he's tried to find out what he needs to do to fix that but it seems like he gets nothing but dead ends. We've talked to my social worker, she works with my doctor. We've submitted stuff, and submitted paperwork saying it needs to be for this other stuff, but nothing ever comes of it.

It's been a few years now (that mom's been receiving benefits).

The form does not look familiar.  I think if she'd filled it out, she'd be like, sign it. My mom probably filled it out and told me to sign it.

After we applied a lady came out to the house to talk to us about how much my mom does for us, and that's when she stressed it was only for my memory problems, not for my physical and mental problems. I guess how the doctor put it in it was only for the memory, but that same dr keeps putting in for more and we get no response. So I don't know if it was some mess up in the original documentation and they can't figure out how to fix it, or what. 

We've talked to everyone we know and everyone is just like we don't know why. ***We don't know why and we don't know what to do.***

That's when the lady came out to the house. She called my mom. That lady called and told my mom (about all the steps).

Oh, it took a while, I'd say a couple months (to hear back).

(Confusion around what they're giving you benefits for, and that they're not hearing correctly) That's the biggest challenge, just them not knowing their own systems. Even the doctor doesn't know what to do to correct the initial mistake or whatever. Just confusion over people knowing the program. Y'know, if they're already confused, they sure can't explain it to us.

[worked well?] Having those monthly meetings for my mom were she can get a little downtime and talk with other caregivers. Y'know, that's good.

[overall, current application process] It's a little on the confusing part, but I've had worse. It's not as bad as trying to get MY benefits. Hehe

[changed after receiving benefits] It made it a little easier knowing she didn't have an actual job since she was taking care of me, so financially it made it a little easier but it could be more.

[need to do] Not totally. I know she, um, she get's those calls and those, uh, when they come out and visit,… sorry, my memory,… and the phone checks, I mean home checks. LOL [mom in the room; is that her, yeah, Hi Mom! Hi! Sorry, I'm not trying to listen in, I just stay in her room.]

I mean, this is what I mean. She's constantly there, she's constantly making sure I'm OK, and that I'm remembering. When I can't take the dog out, she does that.

[to find caregiver benefits online] Where would I find them online?  I have no clue. I'd probably just google it. 

Just VA Caregiver Support. What would you put Mom? Well, before I knew anything about it, I would probably just look for Help for caregivers.

Online would make it really easier.  It's just easier, accessibility wise. 

[Mom: I don't have to take her to VA for anything, unless it's necessary.  The process for applying for caregiver stipend, are anything I need for her is so intense that I prefer to be more at home and relaxed so I can put it down, walk away, and then come back to it.] 

[being at the VA] There's a lot going on, it's really draining, plus if I'm having a bad or tired day, she spends more time focused on me than what outside help she should be looking for.

I wouldn't mind sharing with VA.gov. Oh, I never even thought about VA.gov… I mean, that's not a problem.

Mom's VA.gov access: Oh, yeah. She does that now with the prescriptions and being able to email my doctor, and yeah.

Would you like a portal>
More information on the tiers and how to qualify for them. Information on who to go when your circumstances change. Like when I went from not needing her so much to needing her a lot more. Maybe some sources for, y'know, dealing with your veteran. 

[Mom: For me, personally, more of an on hand type, uh, like taking blood pressure and things like that for her. Because when she was going to fail a folly I kept asking, y'know, just putting this blood pressure machine on her is not working for me. I need more help than that. I was not able to get that sort of help. To get in contact with a nurse that I could actually go to, who I could get to show me the proper way of taking her blood pressure, her pulse and things to that effect. Video would be fine. [What about caregiver groups?]  Oh yeah, that would be great. [in any groups?] Just the monthly meeting we go to. I do have part of ?hearts of valor? and Wounded Warriors, but it used to be WW would send us on retreats once a year, just to get away from the vets, and, y'know, educate us on a lot of things on wellness, not only for the vet but for us. Just different things we needed to know about the vets. Helped with meeting other caregivers in our situation, and be able to talk to them, and sit and relax with someone who knows what you're going through, but, um, they stopped all of those. I would like to maybe get back into something like that because it really helped. My husband took care of my daughter while I went to that. We're kind of picky, I'm sorry! It helped seeing these other caregivers face-to-face, and actually talking with the face-to-face, it's like when I got back from both of them, I was so more relaxed, and more sure of what I was doing with and for her at the time, and if you exchange numbers you can just call them up, y'know. It was just so relaxing, and to get all the information that they gave, it was, it was almost overwhelming, but by the time you left you knew where you were going and what you were doing. I'd really like to do something like that again. It was really a great experience and I came back I was just gung ho, I knew exactly where to go with her. LOL]

Anything else?
Mom: Make the VA easier to navigate. (Both the facility and the website)
Make it easier to get what the Vet needs. It's very hard.
If the Dr puts in the wrong word, say, a request for like a walker for her, and it won't show up.

Veteran: Just making the process all around easier. Just making it easier to navigate.

Some of the recent changes they've made have made it (VA.gov) easier. So, I mean, they're getting better. Still, I've met other veterans, especially the older veterans, that have such a hard time navigating it.
