#Veteran P8 NOTES#

M: Can you tell me a little bit about yourself?
P: I’m 57 years old, married for four years, five years, four and a half years, somewhere in there *laughs*. My wife has been in the states for just over three. She’s Phillippino and she takes great care of me. She’s learning about my disabilities. The biggest one for her is the depression and anxiety. THat’s one she’s had to deal with mostly. She helps me around the house, she helps me bathe, makes sure I don’t slip and fall. She makes sure I’m careful when I do things. She goes with me pretty much everywhere I go. I don’t like leaving the house. I do, but I don’t like it. I don’t like crowds, I don’t like shopping, I don’t… I have some social anxiety. I guess I was a agoraphobic (sp?) even to the point of not leaving my apartment. Before we got married I wouldn’t leave the house. I hated even going to the mailbox. I had to go grocery shopping on occasion but that I did as little as possible and got in and out as quick as possible. And uh… I have back issues, knee issues, weight issues, which VA has finally helped me with. I don’t know what else you wanna know, you can ask anything. I’m not shy about my issues, so. 

M: What about going out gnaws at you?
P: Sometimes it gets overwhelming as far as too much *pause* sensory overload. People, noises. I love kids, but I can’t be around them too long anymore because it just, it just, the running around and them enjoying themselves is really hard to deal with. I don’t want to stop people from that so I take myself out of the situation vs complaining about it. I’ll tell Theresa, my wife, I’ve had enough and I can’t deal with this anymore. 

M: What branch of service were you in?
P: Navy, 12 years. I served my whole time on the west coast. I did four deployments. I volunteered for special boat unit when we were in the Persian Gulf before Desert Storm. I was on ship during Desert Storm, err, before Desert Storm, but I hurt my back so I ended up being state-side the whole time and hated it. I trained to go and I felt like I let my shipmates down. I had surgery for my back issues. They put an infusion pump in and somehow I got an infection. Then depression started really bad then. I was on medA and medB when I got out the Navy. VA didn’t really care, they just wanted to get in and out, so.

M: Where are you located? VA medical center?
P: VA City, located in State. 

M: We were talking before about what it’s like being over-stimulated when you’re out. Do you use much technology? 
P: I’m on my computer. I have an Alienware desktop. 

M: Are you a gamer?
P: Yeah, I play XBOX. It gives me something to do during the day. I know I need to get out and do other things, but it’s just I don’t want to *laughs*. 

M: There’s research that says video games can be helpful with a lot of this stuff. Do you have a mobile device? Tablets?
P: I have a phone. Wife has a tablet. I have a laptop for when I go out of town. I am going to visit my family. I’m adopted. 

M: Do you have Android?
P: I have Android. I don’t like Apple products. 

M: Does your wife also use Windows?
P: She uses her tablet on a rare occasion. She uses her phone a lot and watches YouTube. 

M: Is her cell phone Android or iPhone?
P: Both cell phone and tablet are Android

M: Do you have challenges with them?
P: My wife does. I learn as I go. My brother has a masters in computer programming and stuff so if I have a problem I try to talk with him or someone else. Everything I’ve learned I’ve learned from other people or hitting buttons and stuff

M: What does your wife struggle with?
P: Downloading stuff onto her phone. Sometimes her YouTube won’t work. Basically she needs to turn it off and back on but she forgets to do that. Things like that. Nothing major, ya know she learns as she goes too. 

M: For her English is a second language?
P: Actually for her it’s a third language. She speaks Tgalin (sp) which is the Philippines general common language. She from the Cyan region which has their own dialect. She spoke those prior but she learned English

M: Can it be an issue because of that?
P: Yes

M: Can you tell me a little bit about your wife?
P: She lives with me, in cooking breakfast right now. 

M: What are some of the biggest challenges you and she face?
P: Cultural differences. Sometimes language. She says things and she doesn’t understand the the way it’s said here doesn’t sound… for example her mother passed away in January and my father passed away in July. We also had a dear friend pass in August. I told her, “when you say that, it’s kind of negative that this person just went through this whatever it was. You didn’t get to go to the Philippines because we had problems with your paperwork. It sucks either way when you lose somebody. You can’t say at least you were for her dad.” I watched my dad in and out of the hospital for months before his body gave up. I try to explain, sometimes we get through it. Cultural, we had issues in the past where I had doctors appointments or whatever and we’re late because she has to do the dishes or clean the house. She has to help me bathe, and she has to shower, so. 

M: You were telling me about your anxiety and such. Can you tell me a little more about those challenges? We weren’t recording then.
P: I’m trying to think how to put it. It’s one of those things that’s hard to put it. 

M: Did you have a great weekend?
P: I had a fair weekend

M: What made it fair?
P: Thursday or Friday last week I was at the house and I had a panic attack. I hadn’t had one in a while that I wasn’t able to manage. I can’t remember which day it was, but I could feel it. I was on edge, I was shaking, it just kinda carried over into the weekend.

M: When you feel that way and have to interact on the web, such as filling out a form. Would there be a different way you’d approach it?
P: I never do it unless I have to

M: What percentage do you feel your anxiety.. do you feel you have PTSD?
P: I have been told I have, but I haven’t been diagnosed 

M: What percentage of the week would you say you are feeling the effects of your issues?
P: 10%, 15%, 20%. Depends on what’s going on. Sometimes I have no issues, and then other weeks things just kind of irritate me more for whatever reason. It’s one of those things that’s it’s hard to say every week is 15%. Last week was most of the week. This week, ya know, so far yesterday was okay. It wasn’t a bad day, it was better than fair, but it wasn’t great. Today we have to go out and run some errands. I’m not really looking forward to that, but we have to do it. Bill pain, you know I gotta pay my bills and that’s always stressful for me. 

M: On that subject, do you know if your Caregiver currently receives VA Benefits?
P: Nope, I’m pre-9/11

M: You know the process is opening up to pre-9/11?
P: My understanding when I talked to the Caregiver coordinator back when I signed up Theresa. I was told they were doin Vietnam first. I went in just after Vietnam-era. She (Theresa) doesn’t work because she’s afraid to leave me by myself. When I go to the bathroom she has to help me clean myself up. Up until recently I wasn’t able to clean myself. She helps me bathe. She gets in there and makes sure I’m dried off good so I don’t get infections or anything like that. She takes care of the areas on my body where I have weight. 

M: What do you know about the VA’s Caregiver benefits? How did you find out?
P: A friend of mine got it for a while. She was in Virginia and she had a lot of issues. Her friend also who had a post-9/11 combat vet husband and her friend, the wife, was getting Caregiver benefits. So that’s how I found out about it. I looked it up and found out that I didn’t qualify because of being pre-9/11 vs post-9/11 like they were. 

M: How do you think you would apply to receive benefits from the VA now that it’s about to be pre-9/11? What do you think you would do to apply?
P: I’d have to call the Caregiver coordinator, fill out an application, and then they look at my medical records. My wife has to go through a course. That’s my understanding right now. 

M: How do you think you’d find out if your wife was eligible?
P: Go online and look or contact Caregiver in El Paso"

M: Have you seen this form yet?
P: Online, yes 

M: If you were to fill this out, how would you expect to find out about its status?
P: By mail, I believe. I think they send you mail or a call. I’m not sure. I believe they do make an appointment with you to have somebody come out to check the house and all that stuff.

M: This top part is for Veteran Service member. The second part is for Primary Family Caregiver
P: I would fill it out for her. 

M: It would be your wife's information?
P: Right

M: How long do you think it would take to find out if application is approved or denied?
P: It took me four years to get my unemployability. So it depends on how busy City is if they’re the ones making the decision. I don’t know - a month, two months

M: If you learned application was approved, what would you expect to happen next?
P: Have someone come out to see if my wife and the house are up to standard with my issues. A basic interview of what she does for me. Things like that

M: If you learned application was denied, what steps would you think to take?
P: An appeal

M: What do you think an appeal would look like?
P: I don’t know. Would probably be a form attached with some way to appeal. Similar to other VA benefits. You have to go talk to an actual VA coordinator to get more information generally. 

M: Where would you go to apply for Caregiver benefits online?
P: VA.GOV

M: If you had to search for a way to apply for Caregiver benefits online, what search terms would you use?
P: VA.GOV and search Caregiver Program

M: Would you prefer to complete application online or by printing it out and mailing in paper form?
P: Filling it out online. My handwriting sucks.

M: Is there another way you may prefer to do this?
P: Not that I can think of 

M: I have not played XBOX. But I know that there are some of these things where you could go inside a browser in the game.
P: No. You need a keyboard. Sitting there trying to fill out the information with a controller is… different."

M: How do you feel about sharing your personal information with VA.GOV
P: If I sign into my personal account, I’m not too concerned because it is supposed to be secure. I haven’t heard of any breaches with that.

M: In filling out forms, you fill them out rather than your wife?
P: Correct

M: How do you feel about your wife managing online VA benefits?
P: I wouldn’t have a problem with it but she doesn’t like doing that kind of stuff. 

M: Do you know why?
P: Not really. It’s like using a debit card. She doesn’t like using a debit card, she pays with cash. 

M: If we created an online space for Caregivers to access tools, what do you think would be there?
P: Appointment schedules, medicines, access to health records. Kind of like what I have. it would need to be really secure. Cuz I know not everyone has a spouse as a caregiver. Some people have friends, boyfriend, girlfriend, whatever. If something were to happen you’d want to make sure that you could instantly basically remove them from access. 

M: That’s a great point. Is there anything else you’d like to share?
P: Consistency through the VA. I read an article recently that Caregivers have lost their benefits because they haven’t shown improvement. Some things you can’t.. improvement is relative to certain things. PTSD, anxiety, depression, it can improve to a certain degree but you can have flare ups and things like that. It needs to have consistency throughout the VA in relation to the guidelines. That’s my big thing, consistency. It’s just not with the Caregiver program, it’s with everything. Going from here to other state when I was at the other state VA, they gave me different rules, machines. I can back here had to get a new bypass because my other one was starting to fail. It’s just, consistency.
