# Research Plan: Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers Modernization

August 2019

## Goals

### What product & team are you doing this research for?
This research is for the new Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers Modernization product in support of Mission Act. A new VSA Caregivers team has been created to support the initial discovery effort. 

### Background: Briefly, what is the background of this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?
The VA’s Caregiver program enables caregivers and Veterans to receive benefit payments from VA.  

To date, the Caregiver program has focused on post-911 Veterans. The Mission Act calls for the expansion of this program to all eras of Veterans and an IT system to be built in order to support the expansion of the program.  

The internal system (CARMA) requires the manual input of paper applications (form 1010-CG). When the Caregiver program expands, the paper process will not scale. 

The goal of this research is to understand the caregiver and Veteran needs around applying for the Caregiver benefit. 

The findings from this research will inform a comprehensive plan that includes prioritized recommendations, design, and technical solution for digitizing the caregiver assistance application (including the multiple signature capability) necessary to complete the implementation to meet the June 2020 deadline.


### Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?

*	How did current caregivers learn about the Caregiver program and what was their motivation to apply?
*	What have caregivers and Veterans experienced when applying for the Caregiver Benefit using the current paper application process? 
*	How do caregivers and Veterans feel about the process (from applying for the benefit to receiving it)?
   * Are veterans and caregivers able to receive an application status? 
   * What is the average time an application takes to be processed? 
*	Where do caregivers and Veterans expect to be able to apply for caregiver benefits online?
*	When the online application is launched, how do caregivers and Veterans expect to learn about it?
*	What’s the easiest way for caregivers and Veterans to digitally complete the Application for Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers Program? 
*	How do caregivers and Veterans feel about needing everyone to fill out and sign the application?
*	How do Veteran’s feel about potentially sharing personal information with their caregivers?
*	After submitting an application, what do caregivers and Veterans expect to happen? What questions do they have after they submit the application?
*	Do Veterans and caregivers understand the application process?
*	Do Veterans and caregivers prefer to complete the application process online or via the paper process? Why?


## Hypotheses:
*	Veterans and caregivers will be interested in an online version of the form, but may have some reservations about how to get everyone necessary to sign the form
*	Veterans and caregivers will want an easy way to see the status of their form, and an easy way to know the steps involved in getting benefits
*	The paper form isn’t that onerous, but the process afterwards (clinical assessments, training, and in-home assessments) are a lot to do and keep track of, and anything we can do to stream-line those would help our participants
*	The paper form may be harder to deal with if the veteran doesn’t live with their caregiver
*	Some Veterans may be unable to complete their part of the application. When this situation occurs, the path forward may be unclear to potential caregivers. 
 
## Method

**What method of research are you planning?**

60-minute remote, directed interviews with Veterans and caregivers

**Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?**

This is the easiest way to talk to Veterans and caregivers to learn about their current experience and needs in a one-week timeframe. 

**If remote: What tool do you plan to use?**

Zoom

## Participants and Recruitment
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant? 

* 8 caregivers
   * 4 who are receiving caregiver benefits
   * 4 who are either in the process of applying or considering applying
