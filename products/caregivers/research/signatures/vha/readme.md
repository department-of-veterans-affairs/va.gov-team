From Carnetta Scruggs:

Around years 2012/2013 VCHIO and the PHR Policy workgroup worked with our OGC rep, Nickolas Xanthakos, IAM Security and VHA Privacy to allow VA Forms to be signed online by selecting a check box as well.  There was a project called Veterans Authorization Portal (VAP) that was to present VA Forms online, have Veterans check a box then re-authenticate (Re-enter their DS Logon Premium credential) to be sure it was still them. These flows are no longer in use.

Currently, the VA Delegation Forms will be signed online by Veterans to give the VA their authorization to allow their delegates to access their health data online that uses IAMâ€™s eSig Service. No need for Veteran to re-authenticate.

1) User checks a box:

2) User views/prints their electronically signed form and submits to VA:
