# [DRAFT] Research Plan: VSA Caregiver, Usability research of shortened form based on disability rating, Health Care application 10-10EZ, August 2021

## Background
This research is to be conducted on the Health Care Application (10-10EZ) by the Caregivers team.

Based on our [Google Analytics](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HDGBx-whUrSArDLf8OP_-65lCMPi36h0ihHPA3XqmIk/edit#slide=id.p1) data and [Discovery research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/10-10EZ/Research%20April-May%202021/End%20user%20discovery%20research/research%20findings.md) we have identified that the Military Service and Household Information sections of the 10-10EZ cause applicants the most confusion, time, and show the highest drop-off rates. As part of an iterative process we are working to create [shortened form flows](https://www.sketch.com/s/da85cf44-4503-4e98-834e-ff068b242ef6/p/A71F1C96-FF98-42A2-9ADD-6D4B7A1DDB20) that eliminate these two sections for those that we identify to have a service-connected disability rating of 50% or higher either through information we already have on file (pre-populated) or by the applicant self-reporting it during the application. In the future, once these flows are validated, we will look into expanding this short form experience for other qualifying questions.

## Goals	

The goals of this user research are to:
1. Determine whether or not the short form flow is usable and cognitively understood when it is pre-populated at start of authenticated application
2. Determine whether or not the short form flow is usable and cognitively understood when it is based on a self-reported, service-connected disability pay for a 50% or higher rating
3. Determine whether or not the flow and copy sets proper expectations for the application experience

As a secondary goal, we will also take special note of any participant feedback to the Introduction page as this has recently been updated.

**Research questions**

1. Are users able to navigate through the pre-populated short form easily and without confusion?
2. Are users able to navigate through the short form based on self-reported information easily and without confusion?
3. Do users understand what the short form is?
4. Do users understand why they can fill out a short form?
5. What is the overall sentiment about this short form experience?


**Hypotheses**

Our hypothesis is that users will be able to navigate through the short form relatively easily, but may have issues with the following:
- Understanding what a "short form" is 
- Understanding what is the added value of this experience (because they will not see the skipped questions)
- Getting stuck/confused on the confirmation page after self-reporting pay for a disability rating of 50% or higher


## Method	
**Task analysis**

A task-based usability study will be conducted remotely with Zoom using the Perigean contract. A remote moderator will begin with introduction questions and prompt users with guiding questions (from the conversation guide). Participants will be shown one of three flows:
1. Short form based on pre-populated disability rating of 50% or higher at application start
2. Short form based on self-reported disability rating of 50% or higher on VA compensation question
3. Full form based on self-report of not having a disability rating of 50% or higher on VA compensation question (no more than 20% of participants should receive this flow)


Participants will be encouraged to talk through their exploration of the prototype. Remote observers and note takers will be in attendance.

We will be testing with a coded form in staging or a clickable UXPin prototype or "Wizard of OZ" study with high fidelity designs if the coded form is not ready.
  	

## Participants and Recruitment

- At least 8 people with a disability rating of 50% or higher
- At least least 3 people over the age of 55
- Participants must be able to use Zoom, locate and use the chat function in Zoom, and to share their screen through Zoom



**Participant pool should in diverse in**
- Branch of service
- Gender (30% or more women)
- Education
- Age
- Race
- Geography
- Density (rural)
