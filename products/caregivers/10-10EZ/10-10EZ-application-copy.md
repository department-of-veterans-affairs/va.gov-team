**2. Gather your information**

Here’s what you’ll need to apply:
- **Social Security numbers** for you, your spouse, and your qualified dependents
- **Your military discharge information.** If you sign in to apply, we may be able to fill in this information for you. If you don’t sign in to apply, we’ll ask you to upload a copy of your DD214 or other separation documents.**
- **Insurance cards** for all health insurance companies that cover you. This includes any coverage that you get through a spouse or significant other. This also includes Medicare, private insurance, or insurance from your employer. 


We’ll also ask you for this optional information:
- **Last year's gross household income** for you, your spouse, and your dependents. This includes income from a job and any other sources. Gross household income is your income before taxes and any other deductions.
- **Your deductible expenses for the past year.** These include certain health care and education costs. These expenses will lower the amount of money we count as your income.

Why does the VA need this information?  _(more info)_

When you apply, we review this information:
- Your service history
- Your VA disability rating
- Your income level (and the income level of your spouse or other qualified dependents)
- Your eligibility for Medicaid, VA disability compensation, and VA pension benefits

We use this information to help us decide these 3 things:
- What types of VA health care benefits you're eligible for, **and**
- How soon we enroll you in VA health care, **and**
- How much (if anything) you’ll have to pay toward the cost of your care

We give Veterans with service-connected disabilities the highest priority.

**Note:** We ask about other health insurance for billing only. Having other health insurance doesn’t affect your eligibility for VA health care.
