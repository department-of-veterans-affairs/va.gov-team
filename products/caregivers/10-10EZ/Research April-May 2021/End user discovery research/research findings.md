## Research Goals 

The goals of this user research study are to: 

- Better understand why some Veterans choose to not apply for health care benefits.
- Better understand why Veterans start the application, but don’t complete it.
- Gain human understanding behind the sections that the analytics show high drop-off rates.
- Better understand context, environmental factors, and user behaviors, and feelings about the Health care application.
- Run a general check of the application’s usability and the users’ understanding of the content and why they must provide the information that it asks for.

## Research Methodology 

We conducted 1 pilot + 8 participant remote task-based sessions via Zoom using the Perigean contract. Each moderated session was approximately 1 hour long, in which we asked participants to talk about their health care application experience while asking them to complete a 10-10EZ.  This method allowed us to explore the usability, potential drop-off points, and general sentiment around the 10-10EZ Health care application in staging, and assess the sections that [Google Analytics](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HDGBx-whUrSArDLf8OP_-65lCMPi36h0ihHPA3XqmIk/edit#slide=id.p1) show high drop-off rates as well as general usability of the application.

## Research Questions

The research questions we sought to address: 
- What experiences (personal, social, and medical) bring the user to fill out the application?
  - What other places did the user consider/ turn to for health care (outside of the VA)?
- How well does the introduction prepare users to understand what they need in order to apply?
- Within the application form, what section(s) stop users from completing the form?
- Does the task analysis reflect similar drop-off points as the analytics?
- Why do financial sections have the highest drop-off rate?
  - Does the user understand why financial information must be provided?
- What outside factors does the current form overlook? 


## Key Findings

**General**
1. Participants feel that the VA should already have much of the information that the VA health care application requests.
2. Participants want more transparency on why questions are asked and how that will affect their eligibility.
3. Participants were  unsure how they will receive updates on their application status.
4. Participants noted that questions were hard to understand and they wanted plain language explanations
5. Participants only want to answer questions that are relevant to them and their situation.


**Specific sections**
1. Participants didn’t understand how the Service History section choices were organized,  thus causing confusion when choosing answers and fear of ineligibility.
2. Participants felt the household information section (includes financial disclosure information) was the hardest part of the application. They were uncertain how to find the requested information, unclear what the questions were asking, and how their responses would impact their application.
3. It was difficult for participants that live in states with many facilities to find their preferred facility. Additionally, participants in this study only noticed the "Find locations with the VA Facility Locator" after the participant had already looked through the drop-down menu, thus it was a delayed help for them.
4. Participants did not get enough information from the   Medicaid and Medicare related questions to confidently provide answers.



## Key Findings - General

### Participants feel that the VA should already have much of the information that the VA health care application requests.
- Many participants said that they felt frustration that they had to provide similar information for various VA applications. Many participants believe that the VA should automatically be able to populate most of the information that is asked in the application (linking to taxes and military service history). Some POAs find the questions about service history particularly difficult to find the answers to, especially when the Veteran has cognitive/PTSD/TBI- related injuries that hinder their memory of service dates, paperwork location, and desire to discuss topics.. 

**Note:** This research was conducted unauthenticated, thus participants didn’t have the experience of having some pre-filled fields that an authenticated applicant would have.
> "I file my taxes online, can't it just pull my tax information like the FAFSA does?"

> "Why do I have to fill out the military service history and upload a DD214, doesn't the VA already have this information...from the military?"

### Participants want more transparency on why questions are asked and how that will affect their eligibility.
- The majority of participants worried that their answers to some questions could automatically disqualify them from receiving health care benefits. Some said that they may even quit the application upon seeing the questions, because they thought they would be disqualified anyway. This concern was mainly around military service history, current VA compensation, and financial disclosure. All participants expressed that they wished that there was more transparency about how their answers would impact their health care eligibility. Additionally, participants felt like spouse and dependent information shouldn't impact their health care application. Many participants said that they would be more likely to complete the application if they knew why the information was being requested and how it could help them get VA health care.
> "We are focused on the end result, 'do we qualify?' so it would help us to understand how this information is used."

> "What does my spouse's income have to do with my VA health care? I'm applying for me, not them. This is too nosy, I would say that I am not married." _(participant is married)_

>  _On financial disclosure page_ "I wish it was more clear about the income threshold, I would be worried that I don't qualify."

>  _On current VA benefits page_ Participant selects: I don't receive any VA pay... "Does this mean I don't qualify?"

> "When there are so many questions it feels like they are trying to discourage people from filling out the form - do all these questions even matter?"

### Participants were  unsure how they will receive updates on their application status.
- The application does not require email and/or phone number, and doesn’t ask for a preferred contact method. Participants were therefore uncertain how they would be contacted about the status of their application. Many participants who volunteered their email and/or phone number had expectations that these would be used to contact them regarding their application status, but felt uncertain since these fields were not required. The majority of participants expressed that they would like to be able to choose their preferred contact method. Participants also expressed an expectation that they would receive an email (if email was provided) that their application had been successfully submitted.
> _After application submission_ When asked what they expect to happen next, "I would like to receive an email rather than mail [like previous experience], but I didn't input an email because it's not required and it didn't say communication could be through this."

> _After application submission_ "I wish they let me choose my preferred contact- I don't know if it will come by phone, email, etc...I expect notification of receipt, when it's under review, timeline updates, if they need anything..."

### Participants noted that questions were hard to understand and they wanted plain language explanations.
- The application’s language is not written plainly and does not provide any explanation on how to answer questions. Participants want to know why and how the information is used. Participants had the least clarity around household information, financial questions and who qualifies as a dependent. Finally, some participants expressed concern about security and privacy, especially around uploading their discharge paperwork.
> "Feels like a lot of government gobbly goop."

> "I would like to know how all this information is used and what security measures are taken. My husband is really concerned about security, he wouldn't upload his DD214."

### Participants only want to answer questions that are relevant to them and their situation.
- Participants were frustrated by having to answer irrelevant questions. They also were frustrated by having to fill in information that felt nonsensical, such as when biological children became dependents or providing income for adult children. 
> "The dependent section is so long, I have three kids, can't I just click something so they have the same last name? Also 'when did they become your dependent?' Isn't this the same as their birthdate? And if they don't fall in the 18-24 range, then why is it asking if I paid for school and their income?"

## Key Findings - Section specific

### Participants didn’t understand how the Service History section choices were organized, thus causing confusion when choosing answers and fear of ineligibility.
The service history page causes confusion for two main reasons:
 - Many participants believe that if none of the service history list applies to them that they could be disqualified from VA health care. 

> _On service history page_ "Since none of these apply to me, I would be worried this would disqualify me." _When asked if it would deter from finishing form_ "It might, yes."

 - The information architecture of this page also causes categorization confusion. Most participants wonder what the list (category) is and how it will be used. Some participants wonder why there are not more recent events/situations listed.

> "What do these have to do with health care?"

> "These seem outdated. I'm looking for something having to do with Iraq."

> When asked how they think this information will be used. "Maybe this will be used to determine my treatment plan?"

### Participants felt the household information section (includes financial disclosure information) was the hardest part of the application. They were uncertain how to find the requested information, unclear what the questions were asking, and how their responses would impact their application.
- Many people were just unclear on how to fill out these questions. They weren't always sure where to find this information and they also felt uncertain as to what the questions were asking for. Many also felt trepidation about how the information would be used and its impact on their qualification for health care. Additionally, the dependent section causes confusion as to what qualifies as a dependent and for those that the dependent is their child, the "When did they become your dependent?" question is confusing.

> "Oh geeze. Oh jesus....Now I need to call my tax man...It should say what box to refer to on my tax form or just let me upload it."  _(In regards to financial disclosure and dependents information)_

> "Will my financial information impact the health coverage I receive?"

> "When I filled this out in the past, I had to call my husband, he didn't have the paperwork with him so I had to save the form and finish it at home with the kids running around."

> "What is a dependent defined? My spouse? I also finance my spouse's parents, but they live in the Philippines, do they count or do I have to go by the IRS definition?"

> In regards to net income: "Does a house count?"

> In regards to previous year's deductibles, "It asks amount for you or your spouse [paid in non-reimbursable medical expenses this year]. Does it mean 'and'? Does a deductible qualify?"

### It was difficult for participants that live in states with many facilities to find their preferred facility. Additionally, participants in this study only noticed the "Find locations with the VA Facility Locator" after the participant had already looked through the drop-down menu, thus it was a delayed help for them.
- For Veterans that live in a state with many facilities, selecting a VA medical facility took time and caused some confusion. The list is not in alphabetical order thus participants had to read each one in order to make their selection. Many participants expressed that they were not sure which one to choose, especially those who don't regularly visit a VA center or clinic. The "Find locations with the VA Facility Locator" (when noticed) was noticed after the participant had already looked through the drop-down menu, thus it was a delayed help for them.

> _Looks through drop-down VA center or clinic_ "I guess I would have to Google that." _Closes list_ "Oh there is a 'Find locations with VA Facility Locator' I see now. _Clicks on it_ "That would be helpful."

### Participants did not get enough information from the Medicaid and Medicare related questions to confidently provide answers.
- Many participants did not know if they qualified for Medicaid or Medicare (even when reading the more information component). Some wished they could answer, "I don't know," some said they would have to stop and do research. Additionally, one participant faced confusion with the design, and thought that the more information component was the question itself.
> "I wish I could answer 'I don't know' because if I put 'no' then I would think it would be on my record and I would be disqualified from getting it, but I don't know if I am."


## Additional Insights
* Most Veterans do not differentiate the nomenclature of the VA benefits and health care, they are all "VA benefits" to them. Additionally there are no distinguishing visual cues.
  *   This causes applicants to have uncertainty as to which form they have/will fill out and what benefits will be gained from that application. 

* The form progression is unclear. This is due to the inconsistent progress bar advancement and use of same titles on multiple pages.

* The unauthenticated experience is redundant (name, social security number), this led the majority of participants to believe that they had made a mistake. 

* People appreciate the more information component, but it also can create confusion depending on its placement- sometimes people don't see it, think it is the question, or don't automatically seek it out when they need more information about a question. 

* Some participants found the way that the page advances from one to the next jarring and were unsure if their information input had been accepted.

### Hypotheses

1. Veterans don’t complete the form because they found a different source of health care (outside of the VA).
    1. LIKELY FALSE: The participants that we talked to came to the VA health care because of a change in life circumstance, leaving military, loss of job, increased impact of service-related health condition, etc. thus they were specifically seeking VA health care, not just health insurance in general.
2. Veterans don’t complete the form because they are unclear as to what information to provide in specific sections (mainly sections related to finances).
    1. LIKELY TRUE: The majority of participants named the household information (which includes the financial information) as the hardest part. Multiple participants said that they would have to ask another person for help (spouse, tax preparer, VSO, etc.). Others said that they would have to guess because they were unclear about the specific meaning of the question.
3. Veterans don’t complete the form because they don’t have information readily available (mainly sections related to finances).
    1. LIKELY TRUE: One participant specifically said that she had to save the form for almost a month before she was able to gather the financial information. Two POA participants said that they had to stop and get help because in the past they didn't know how to find the service history information and discharge paperwork. Some said that they might give up.
4. Veterans don’t complete the form because they feel uncomfortable disclosing certain information.
    1. LIKELY TRUE: Participants expressed concern about the security of uploading discharge papers, providing information about their own and their spouses finances, and around their service history. Multiple participants stated that some of the questions in these sections might be a barrier of completion with some feeling that they are invasive and nosy while others felt concerns for the security of their information, worrying about stolen identity.
5. Online forms innately create different obstacles/less flexibility than paper/in-person experiences.
    1. PARTIALLY TRUE: Many participants thought that they had filled out the VA health care application when they first left the military and did so with assistance. By filling it out in-person they were able to clarify questions' meaning and how their answers would impact their health care eligibility.


## Recommendations

### Transparency
1. Clarify that each question is necessary and be able to answer how it is used to determine VA health care eligibility, providing explanations for questions that the research and analytics show to be the most troublesome for applicants.
2. Explore progress bar and heading title options to provide clearer progression
3. Mitigate fear of being automatically disqualified

### Reduced burden
1. Create an information architecture that naturally reflects Veteran heuristics, exploring the following options:
    1. Order of questions should be chunked according to Veterans' mental model
    2. Headings on page should be properly labeled to reflect application progression
    3. Explore automatic qualifiers (Veterans who have automatically qualifying factors will not have to fill out the entire form)
    4. Create dependencies based on input information (ie. only ask service related questions that are date dependent based on applicant's service dates)

2. Rewrite confusing questions in plain language (also improves accessibility)
3. Explore ways to better implement VA Facility locator
4. Explore ways to automatically generate information (eg. from tax filing, other military databases, etc.)
5. Find out if it is possible to eliminate repeated questions for the unauthenticated experience
6. Simplify Introduction page

### Trust
1. Clarify how the Veteran will be notified with application status updates
    1.  Explore e-mail validation link
    2.  Explore e-mail confirmation on submission
    3.  Explore preferred contact option

2. Provide security and privacy information within the Military Service and Household Information sections

### Accessibility
1. Explore 1 question per page (also reduces burden)
2. Make sure that all button and link treatment and behavior is correct
3. Headings on page should be properly labeled for screen reader accessibility 

## Next Steps

1. Clarify that each question is necessary and be able to answer how it is used to determine VA health care eligibility removing any question that is not required by the program team (if any)
2. Rewrite any question/choices that caused confusion (including updating the gender, preferred contact, and simplifying introduction page)
3. Create content "source of truth"
4. Update the flow 
    1. Explore automatic qualification
    2. Explore making more questions dependent on applicants' answers
    3. Update order putting emotionally difficult questions near the beginning and ensuring other questions are chunked based on Veteran heuristics
5. Design one question per page with space for additional information
6. Conduct A/B testing with 1 question per page and current flow

### Development
1. Explore ways to remove the repeated name, birthdate, and Social Security number for the unauthenticated experience
2. Make sure that all button and link treatment and behavior is correct (in collaboration with design)
3. Explore ways to implement VA Facility locator API
4. Explore ways to automatically generate information (eg. from tax filing, other military databases, etc.)
5. Research the implementation of e-mail validation link and e-mail submission confirmation
6. After content and design is updated, make sure that all headings are labeled correctly (1,2,3,etc.)

###  In the future
* Explore how to update progress bar and headings
