## Project-Specific Setup and Intro - 10 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Dené and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to discuss your experiences around applying for Health Care with the VA and go through the application itself.

- This entire session should take about 1 hour. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- You'll be interacting with a a demo tool. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- Please talk aloud as you're looking through things. For example, say "now I'd click on this.. what's this?" This helps me understand what's going through your head while using the tool.
- To protect your privacy, we are not going to use your real name or Social Security Number today. Feel free to make-up a name, birthday, SSN...I can always provide that information if you want
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

**Talk them through Zoom screen sharing and chat features.**


**I'm going to send you a link in the chat.**
_ I actually do this as I’m explaining to them where to find “Chat” and “Share,” so by the end I’m looking at their screen, then I move onto recording._

**Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:**

- Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "Drive". You will tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok?
- [Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen?


**Recording Instructions**

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording to the Cloud.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?"** 

Great. Now we're really ready to begin!

## Health Care application introduction page - 10 minutes

Now that I understand a little bit more about your background. 

Let's look at the screen that I have shared with you. Put yourself back to the moment that you arrived at this screen to apply for benefits in the past. (or if has never applied- you arrive here with the intention of applying for benefits.) https://staging.va.gov/health-care/apply/application/introduction  Go ahead and talk me through what you would do upon arriving at this page. 

If the participant immediately moves to click on "start your application..." button, I will ask them if they usually read this intro page, even if no, continue with the following questions.

- Please read the entire page and let me know if any questions come to mind.
- After participant reads and initial questions are noted:
  - What do you think of the listed requirements? 
  - Is there anything that you would not have on-hand or would need to prepare before starting this application?
  - Do you have any additional thoughts or questions? 



## Applying for healthcare benefits task - 25 minutes

Go ahead and continue as if you were applying for healthcare.

Things to watch for:

In general, we want to sit back and watch them, but if they hesitate you can say “I noticed you hesitate here, what are you thinking?”

- Remind participants to think out loud. 
- Any hiccups? Do they know all the information?
- Any fields trip them up? Why?

  - Personal information
  - Service information
