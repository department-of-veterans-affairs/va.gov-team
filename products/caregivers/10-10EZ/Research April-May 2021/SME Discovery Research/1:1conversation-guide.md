## Project-Specific Setup and Intro - 10 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Dené and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today I'd like to gather insight from your professional experiences around the 10-10EZ Health Care application.

- This entire session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer.
- We would like this to be an open-ended conversation. Please don't hesitate to bring up specific experiences, unique workarounds, and even correct my questions. I recognize that you have experience with Veterans and this application that I don't have, and that my insight of the digital form might not take into account other environmental, human, online influences. That is why we are here, with the goal of improving these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your insight and feedback.
- This interview will only be used to improve the design/content of the online application, and will not be attributed directly to you.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

**Talk them through Zoom screen sharing and chat features.**


**I'm going to send you a link in the chat.**
_I actually do this as I’m explaining to them where to find “Chat” and “Share,” so by the end I’m looking at their screen, then I move onto recording._

**Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:**

- Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "Drive". You will tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok?
- [Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen?

**Recording Instructions**

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?"** 

Great. Now we're really ready to begin!

## Warm-up Questions - 15 minutes

- Tell me a little about yourself and your position at the VA
- What interactions do you have with the Health Care Application form (whether that is helping Veterans complete the application, processing applications, etc.)
- How long have you been working in this position? Were you working in this position when the digital form became available?
  -  If so, has your role related to the applications changed since the digital version became available?
-  Online forms innately create different obstacles/less flexibility than paper/in-person experiences/processing.
  -  What outside factors does the digital form overlook? (Perhaps special handling methods used before the form was digital that the digital form doesn’t account for or just other environmental, social, medical, human factors that should be considered)
- Are there specific sections of the form that you have found to create barriers for completion?
  - How do you help Veterans work through these sections? (Make note to discuss how to further improve these sections during walkthrough)
-  What do you hear from Veterans about the digital Health Care application? (feedback/general)


## Health Care application Participatory Design Walkthrough - 25 minutes

Now that I understand a little bit more about your background. 

Let's look at the screen that I have shared with you. https://staging.va.gov/health-care/apply/application/introduction  

What I would like to do is walkthrough this form with you together, and talk through sections that you have pointed out to be challenging for Veterans. Think of this as a sort of workshop where we brainstorm answers together.

If they need a SSN, use 548-79-5555

At identified participant difficult sections:
- What do you think makes this section a barrier for Veterans? (They don't know the information, they feel it is to private, they don't know what it is asking)
  - How would you help a Veteran get through this? What suggestions/ workarounds?
  - Are there other factors as to why this section is a barrier that I might not know about?

 Our [Analytics](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HDGBx-whUrSArDLf8OP_-65lCMPi36h0ihHPA3XqmIk/edit#slide=id.p1) have shown high drop-off points as:
  - Personal information
  - Service information
  - Financial disclosure
  - Spouse
  - Annual income
Why do you think these sections in particular create barriers?
  - Do you think that Veteran knows why this information is requested?
  - How would you help a Veteran get through this? What suggestions/ workarounds?
  - Are there other factors as to why this section is a barrier that I might not know about?

What happens after a Veteran submits this form?
- In your experience, do Veterans usually know what to expect after submitting this form?

## Post task questions - 5 minutes

Wonderful! I have a few questions about your experience filling out this form.

**Overall** 

- If you could give one (or more) pieces of advice to a Veteran about to start this application, what would it be?
- What methods are currently being used to remind Veterans to return and finish saved applications that are incomplete?
- Any other thoughts about the form?
- Do you have any questions for me before we conclude?
 
## Thank you and Closing

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to improve our products and services for Veterans and service members.
Great, thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
