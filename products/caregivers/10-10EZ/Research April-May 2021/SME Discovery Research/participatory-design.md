# Research Plan: VSA Caregiver, Discovery phase of Health Care application 10-10EZ, part 1 (subject matter experts), April 2021

## Background

This research is to be conducted on the Health Care Application (10-10EZ) by the Health and Care team.

Live: https://www.va.gov/health-care/apply/application/introduction
Staging: https://staging.va.gov/health-care/apply/application/introduction

The purpose of this phase of discovery research is to reflect and synthesize the insight gained from the interviews with SMEs and end users. Through participatory design “workshopping,” in conjunction with SMEs, it is our aspiration to be able to create a more robust plan for changing the design that takes both the online and offline experience of submitting a Health Care application into consideration.


## Goals

The goals of this user research study are to: 

- Start to discuss solutions for reducing the number of Veterans that start the application, but don’t complete it.
- Begin looking at design changes for the sections that discovery research is showing to be creating barriers for application completion.
- Explore how to incorporate offline workarounds into the digital application.


### Research questions

The research questions we want to address are: 

- How can the digital application better take into account people’s environment and human factors. (personal, social, and medical) that they experience before and during the application process?
- Do our design ideas make difficult sections easier?
- How can we incorporate offline workarounds into our design? Perhaps special handling methods used before the form was digital that the digital form doesn’t account for.
- What methods can be used to remind users who have saved an application, but have not completed it?



## Methodology 

### Participatory design workshop
1-2 workshops will be conducted with SMEs. We will discuss specific sections of the form that caused participants difficulty and also sections reflected in the Analytics as high drop-off rates to further synthesize our research findings to get SME perspective. We will also look at some prototypes and discuss how we can reduce barriers in specific sections of the HCA.
- Interviews will be conducted with SMEs who process Health Care applications submitted both in paper and online format and/or VSOs who help Veteran’s fill out the application.
- Walkthrough of application with some participatory design discussions about key identified high drop-off sections.



## Participants and Recruitment

Ideally we would have one group that consists of a combination of both VA employees and VSOs (at least 2 of each). Alternatively we would have a group of 3-5 participants that are either staff or VSOs.

**Participant pool should be diverse in, but not required:**

All participants must be yes to one of the following questions:

- Type of facility works at (large hospital, small clinic and urban vs. rural)
- Amount of applications handled (a few a month vs. hundreds)
- Years of experience; experience handling paper vs. digital


## Timeline 

**Desired Timeline: April 27 - May 3, 2021**

Session length: 1 hour
