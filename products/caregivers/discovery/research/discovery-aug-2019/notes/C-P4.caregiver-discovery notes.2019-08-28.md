#2019-08-28 Caregiver P4 Strickland#

**Can you tell me a little about yourself? **
I am also a veteran, so that's how my wounded warrior and I met, we were serving together. We're residing in ####. Where we signed up for the caregiver program, most of the vpa things. Recently his mom got sick, so we went up to #### to help her. We got out of the caregiver program, but #### is still having the spinal problems and surgeries. I work for a vet/military nonprofit, but work remotely and hours are flexible, so I can serve as a caregiver.

We didn't use the website, we did everything through his primary care and specialist providers as the va.

**Tell me about your experience with technology?**
We both use computers. I think we're both more computer savvy than most, but I guess it depends on what we're doing exactly.
My work is in data operations mgmt. so everything I do for work in on the computer. I do a lot of troubleshooting with our CRM. I do a lot of html and css with our website. [Veteran] is … I mean, he can build his own computer, he's pretty techy. He has a lot of skills in the it. Since he was a kid, he really enjoys computers and figuring things out. He also enjoys video games.

**Which medical center does the Veteran you currently help receive care at?**
Currently he's at the #### VA.

**How did you find out about VA benefits for caregivers?**
I found out about the program through some friends that were in the program. I was also researching things that were available. I heard about it through friends, then did some looking into it on my own. I found out that we were eligible. I didn't know there was a way to do it online. We just contacted his providers and did it through them.

**If you had to search for a way to apply for caregiver benefits online, what search terms would you use?**
I would search for VA Caregiver Program. I did a lot of my reading on it on the VA's website.

**Would you prefer to complete the application online or by filling out and mailing the paper form? Why?**
His doctor submitted everything for us, so it was a really easy process for us. Then we received a letter saying we'd been approved for the program. Then we had an in-home visit with a home care nurse, then some training with easter seals on the computer. It was really not stressful at all. I feel like it was smooth and easy for us.

*SHARE FORM*

**Do you remember filling out this form?**
The form looks familiar to me.

I don't think I filled this out, although I may have. I don't remember specifically if I did. Oh, yeah, I did fill this out, actually.

**What were the hardest parts about it?**
I don't remember having any trouble with any of the paperwork. I remember hearing other people complain but I didn't have any of those struggles.

It just said sign here, so … (completed paper forms in doctor office)

**Where would you go to apply to receive caregiver benefits online?**
We filled it out with the doctor in their office.
For us it was easy, but I do see how it could be more convenient for people to fill it out online, so I think it's a great idea.

**How do you feel about sharing your personal information with VA.gov as part of the caregiver benefit application process?**
The VA already has all my information, so I'm never worried about that part of it.

**Veterans can access certain benefits like refilling prescriptions and managing VA health care appointments online at VA.gov. Do you manage these benefits for the Veteran that you care for?**
Yes, I manage these benefits for my husband. It's pretty easy. We do the secure messaging with his providers. All the prescriptions are mailed to us, it's pretty easy, you just punch in the prescription code, and they send it. If we need more refills we just message th providers. We're also able to look at his imaging results. They'll upload those to his account as well. I think they changed the name… I don't remember what it is. I do like the online one. The only thing that's difficult is… like, if we had something done a couple years ago in San Diego we can't access those now. If it's recent, we can just click on it and dl it.

**If we created an online space for caregivers to sign in and access help and tools, what would you hope to find there?**
I think online tools for caregivers is a great idea. I'm part of a lot of online caregiver groups, and see a lot of things others have a hard time with. Like, sometimes the veteran doesn't want to share info with them, or they can't get into the caregiver program, but that doesn't mean their veteran doesn't need care. If there was a place where they could share info or make adjustments, I think that would be really helpful.

**Is there anything else that you would like to share with us about your experience as a caregiver?**
Ours was pretty straightforward, we didn't have any issues. The only thing I can say is that bc of the nurse shortage, it was difficult to make sure we had all of the appts we were supposed to have, they'd be canceled or rescheduled. They'd go a whole year, and they're supposed to be done quarterly, and they'd say there's only 2 nurses. I mean, if it says you're supposed to have this appt, … I felt kind of bad about it. We were so busy, and it felt like ppl fell through the cracks. It worried me about ppl who might really need that. Having enough VA staff, I guess.

We were in the program for 2 years. 

Might possibly be interested in applying for the program again. Right now I wouldn't bc #### is trying to find a job, he really wants to try to do. If in the future he is unable to work, that might be reason to reapply.

The eligibility … I don't have 100% verbatim … I know they need to be service-connected for conditions that took place during their service, based on era right now. The vet has to have served post-911. If they're able to be by themselves for a certain amount of time… like go to work for 8 hours / day, then the va wouldn't consider them needing a caregiver. Like it's really the vet that needs assistance with daily things, like taking a shower, getting dressed… It used to be if they couldn't cook meals or drive themselves, but I think they changed that. There's certain criteria you have to meet to be considered eligible.

I learned the criteria through his primary care. They did all of that process for us, which was really nice. It was through the VA. They found him eligible, which was really helpful.
