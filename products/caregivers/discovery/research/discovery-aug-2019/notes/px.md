##  Introduction
(About 5 minutes)

#### Moderator: Thank you for joining us today! My name is Riley. I am a designer and researcher for VA.gov and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about your experience applying to receive caregiver assistance. Are you familiar with that program?

**Veteran**: Somewhat. My wife is more so familiar.

#### Moderator: Have you applied to that program?

**Veteran**: Yes, with my wife being the caregiver.

#### Moderator: Okay, great. Before we start, I want to mention a few things:

- This entire session should take about 45 minutes I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. So please let us know what you think, and any ideas on how we can improve this process for you. We are not testing your abilities or knowledge in any way. We want to improve the caregiver benefit application process to better meet Veteran and caregivers' needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.

- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

**Veteran**: Yes, that's fine.

*Start recording.*

## Warm-up Questions

#### Moderator: Can you tell me a little about yourself? (If stuck, ask about service, location, occupation, etc.)

**Veteran**: In what way? Personality, or...?

#### Moderator: Sure, where do you live, what's your occupation, hobbies...

**Veteran**: I live in Arkansas, I have some college education, I pretty much went straight into the work force and once the war happened, I wanted to go to the army. I tried doing some school after, but it didn't work for me because of my medical situation. Basically I'm um... I don't know where to go here because my life is very complicated, I'm not really a normal person. Yeah, I don't know where to go.

#### Moderator: Are you pre- or post-9/11?

**Veteran**: Post 9/11.

#### Moderator: Do you receive care from the VA?

**Veteran**: In my opinion, no, in VA's opinion yes.

#### Moderator: Do you regularly use a computer? Mobile device?

**Veteran**: Up until the military I was very into technology in most ways from coding to hardware. I did all kinds of things. After the military I didn't do much because I was in infantry. Tech wasn't really our focus. There was a big gap in tech that I missed out on. I got an iPhone after, PC kind of dwindled... I still kind of have knowledge but don't use it as often. I use iPhone and iPad today, but I'm knowledgeable in both.

#### Moderator: Do you use any accessibility features on your devices, like enlarging text or voiceover?

**Veteran**: It depends on the website. Occasionally, I do zoom on things and have to enlarge text on things from time to time. 

#### Moderator: Are there certain types of interactions that are particularly challenging? 

**Veteran**: Um... with technology? 

#### Moderator: Yes.

**Veteran**: Oh okay. No... Can't think of anything.

#### Moderator: Can you tell me a little bit about your caregiver? Do they live with you?

**Veteran**: Yes. My wife. We've been married almost 16 years. I knew her well before the army and well after which prepared us greatly for our situation. To be honest, because of my medical situation, I'm childlike. I don't mean that mentally, I mean that in behavior. I have to be told a lot of things to do, reminded a lot of things. Her being my caregiver in my situation makes it simple, because she knows me. She helps me... it's really quite embarrassing, but I've lost a lot of memory and have trouble remembering things day to day. She has to remind me to take a shower, brush your teeth. She doesn't do them for me, but has to remind me. And sometimes she has to help me because I can't physically bend down and tie shoes and put socks on.
  
#### Moderator: She is your primary caregiver?
  
**Veteran**: Yes.

#### Moderator: Do you know if your caregiver receives benefits from the VA?

**Veteran**: Oh no, we were denied benefits. I was told based on my medical situation I don't qualify. But my situation is very complicated, my medical records got messed up very early on and it has snowballed.
   
## Questions: Veterans with caregivers who DO NOT receive benefits

#### Moderator: How did you find the benefits?
   
**Veteran**: My wife found it - she started looking into how we could get help outside of primary care at VA. My doctor wasn't doing anything, so she explored other avenues and found Caregiver. We went through the application process and she did the online application.

**Veteran**: I can't tell you exactly how to go through the process, this is where my memory stuff comes in. I can't remember what we did - we sat down, she asked me questions and fill in the answers. It was easy to apply, and easy to communicate with whoever she was talking to at the VA. I think the...VSO... whoever they are, the experience was easy. There were no complications or difficulties. She found it literally by googling what things she could do to help us. It was easy to find, easy to do.

#### Moderator: I’m going to share my screen and show you a PDF version of the paper application form.

*Share screen and show [paper form](https://www.va.gov/health-care/forms/vha-10-10CG.pdf).*

#### Moderator: Does any of it look familiar?

**Veteran**: Not really, I recognize the format as the standard VA form... I don't remember seeing this specifically, though.

[Moderator scrolls]

#### Moderator: This is the section where the Veteran information would be. Here is where the Caregiver information would be. So your wife may have taken care of this part.

**Veteran**: I'm asking her to come back in the room so she can look at it. She'll recognize it right off. I don't know that I've seen it, but she does all the paperwork to be honest because my handwriting is so terrible. We would never do anything if it weren't for that.

#### Moderator: Do you remember the signing process?

**Veteran**: No, I don't. But to be fair, I don't remember what I ate yesterday or if I ate yesterday so I'm not going to remember signing it. But I did. If my wife filled it out, I signed it.

#### Moderator: If you were to apply again, would you think it's easier to do it online?

**Veteran**: I like to fill in the PDF style. Fill out the info, type it in, print it out, mail it in, sign it. My wife is back and she can hear you so if you have any questions...

[Talks to his wife, describes the form]

[Veteran's wife says hello]

[Moderator describes the form, gives Veteran's wife context of the feedback session]

#### Moderator: Could we get some more information about your experience applying?

**Caregiver**: Sure.

#### Moderator: Do you remember filling out this form?

**Caregiver**: Yes, I do.

**Veteran**: I knew you'd remember. 

#### Moderator: Did you fill out the form as an interactive PDF, or fill it out by hand?

**Caregiver**: Filled it out by hand.

#### Moderator: When you filled it out, did you and [your husband] fill it out together?

**Caregiver**: I filled out most of the information and had him sign it.

**Veteran**: Was I even there? _(laughing)_

#### Moderator: You filled it out by hand and signed it with pen and ink?

**Caregiver**: Yes.

#### Moderator: After you sent it in, what happened?

**Caregiver**: I filled it out at one of the local offices during one of his appointments and dropped it off at the front desk. I waited 2 weeks or so to check on the status, and make sure they had gotten it. They said yes they had received it and were reviewing it and would be in touch.

#### Moderator: Did they get back in touch?

**Caregiver**: They sent a letter in the mail saying I was denied. 

#### Moderator: I'm sorry you were denied. What steps did you take then?

**Veteran**: Absolutely nothing. We didn't know where to go after that. We didn't know how to prove that we weren't... The big trouble with me, I have nerve damage in my leg but in my medical records it says shin splints. It says muscle sprain in my back but it's really herniated discs. Whenever I go anywhere and they look at my file, they think I should be running and jumping but I'm really like an elderly man and can barely walk.

**Veteran**: When they sent us the result, they said I was medically able to take care of myself and not in need. So we didn't know where to go.

#### Moderator: Were those medical records part of the VA?

**Veteran**: Oh yes, all from the VA. Immediately when I got home from the army I went to the VA. They knew there were medical issues so I could re-up and they wanted to medboard me. I said I'm not signing a contract for 3 years to just lay around. Something got screwed up in the beginning and that's where all this went wrong. The caregiver program must've looked at my medical records and saw according to that, I was doing ok.

**Caregiver**: It was lack of information and we didn't know how to proceed with the appeal oranything.

#### Moderator: Did you try looking into any sort of appeal?

**Veteran**: We talked to my doctor some but they aren't really even helpful as a doctor. After that...

**Caregiver**: We just decided to not fight it I guess.

#### Moderator: You found the caregiver program through your own research? Could you tell  me a little more about how you found it?

**Caregiver**: Yes, Google was my best friend once this happened, and a lot of Facebook groups with other caregivers. They helped a little bit with what forms that I needed to use and stuff.

#### Moderator: Ok, so mostly through Facebook groups and resources outside the VA? Did you find any resources through the VA website?

**Caregiver**: THe VA website is very complicated I feel. Usually the search bar brings up not just your specific VA but the whole VA system. It took a lot of time. No help was given from within the VA, directing me, "Hey go here," or "Here is the form number." It was all strictly my research alone.

#### Moderator: If you were to apply for the caregivers program again, would it be helpful for you to follow a similar procedure of filling out the form again? Or online?

**Veteran, Caregiver**: Online, definitely.

#### Moderator: If we were to create an online portal for caregivers, what sorts of resources would you want to see?

**Caregiver**: Support for myself, along with pertinent information for him. Setting up appointments, how to navigate the VA system. How to use the different portals.

**Veteran**: I think the VA likes to count on the person that is supposed to help - what are they called? The patient advocate. Their intention is to rely on them a lot to give the info to the soldiers that ask for it and need it. In my experience, the patient advocate is not on my side. I asked for help from them when my doctor wasn't helping, and they turned around and told my doctor. I can't go to them and ask for help with this because I can't even trust them to not rat me out to my doctor. All of it needs to be online and available for people like us who want to search and get it on our own. If it's up to the VA, there are bad apples in the system and if they are the only source of information then we as the soldier are screwed.

**Caregiver**: Having a central location and login, having different tabs and a search bar so I can look for what I'm needing that day and it can point me in that direction so I'm not using the google search because that is very labor intensive.

#### Moderator: Can you tell me about your experience using technology?

**Caregiver**: Oh yes. Before I stayed home, I was using a computer at work 5 days a week, 40hrs/week.

#### Moderator: Do you use any accessibility features on any of your devices?

**Caregiver**: No, we do not.

[Side convo between Caregiver and Veteran about enlarging text on phone]

#### Moderator: How do you feel about sharing your personal info with VA.gov as part of the process?

**Caregiver**: Like my social security number? He's ok with it, he doesn't care because they already have that. I'm more hesitant, but I know they require it to verify me. As long as it stays with VA.gov I'm ok but when other websites start asking for it, I get leery.

#### Moderator: Do you manage benefits online for [your husband]?

**Veteran**: Yes.

**Caregiver**: [_laughs_] I'm more of the reminder.

**Veteran**: When I was on a lot of meds, it made it a lot easier to refill prescriptions online. I like that online interactive. To be honest, I feel like as much as I can do on my own, I would like that. I would like to do as much as possible on my own but when I need help then I can go and talk to someone. All the online pharmacy stuff and appointment stuff is pretty good and functional.

**Caregiver**: Yeah they are.

#### Moderator: Anything else you want to share?

**Caregiver**: I know a lot more now, being several years later. Since things have changed health-wise, I do plan on applying again. I guess more information on how to appeal. What information and documentation do I need to provide. More information on the appeal process itself.

**Veteran**: What steps after you are denied. It can't be just a shut door. Everyone is different. If they had looked at me, if they had had a visit with me, they would've seen something isn't right in the paperwork. Every civilian doctor that I've met has told me that I do not represent my medical file. Any info that can help the solider after they are denied. Some will be denied and that's fine, and some will be falsely denied and they need an avenue. Like she said, we haven't looked in awhile so there may be more now.
