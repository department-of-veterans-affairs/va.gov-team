# Veteran P1 NOTES

See [conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/research/discovery-aug-2019/veteran-conversation-guide.md)

Somewhat familiar with the program, my wife is more familiar.

Yes, I have applied, or my wife did…

Um, in what way, personality or individual? Okay, I live in #####. I have some college education. I pretty much went straight into the work field. Once the war happened, I wanted to help, so I went into the military. It … because of my medical condition I couldn't go into the military. Im post 911.

In my opinion, no. In the VA's opinion, yes. In the VA of the ####, in ####, ####.

Up until the military I was very much into tech, from coding to hardware. After the military, I didn't, bc I was infantry, not so much. I came back to iPhones, but I used pc. I use mostly iPhones today. Knowledgable in both. 

Accessibilityy features. On occasion. It depends on the webpage I'm looking at. I do have to use zoom or enlarge text from time to time. Nothing particularly challenging.

My wife, we've been married 16y, I knew her well b4 the army, and well after. Which prepared us greatly for our situation. TBH, bc of my medical situation, I'm childlike… not physically, but mentally. I have to be reminded about a lot of things. BC of husband wife, it's really helpful. I've lost a lot of memory. She has to remind me to take a shower, brush my teeth. She has to remind me, like before we leave. She has to help me, bc I can't physically tie my shoes. It's pretty much like an elderly person, that's how she cares for me. 

Primary caregiver - she lives with me.

I was told based on my medical condition, I was not qualified. According to the VA there's nothing wrong with me. My medical records got messed up. That's a long story.

Actually my wife did. She started looking into what help we could get outside of the VA. My doctor wasn't helping me, so she thought there might be other avenues. She found the caregiver program, so she applied. She did the online application.

This is where the memory problem comes in. If you ask me, I can't remember what exactly we did. I remember we sat down, she asked me questions, she would fill out her part, I remember it was easy to apply, easy to communicate with whoever she VHSO was talking to. As far as the experience it was easy, no complications. She found it just by googling, what she could do to help us. 


Not really, this form doesn't look familiar. I recognize the standard VA form… I don't remember seeing this form, though. I'm asking her to come back int he room. She's going to recognize it right off. She filled it out, she does the paperwork, my handwriting is so terrible. 

No, I don't remember anything about signing… but to be fair, I don't remember what I ate yesterday. But, I did. If my wife filled it out, then I signed it.

I like filling in PDF style. I've done that a lot in other forms. I like that you can fill it out, print it out, sign it, then mail it. My wife is back, and she can hear you, so if she can help you…

I'm good how are you (wife).

Yes, I (remember filling out this form) do.

I filled out the form by hand. (H oh, I was wrong. That's when you did. I didn't realize it was that long ago)
I basically filled out most of the info and had him sign it. H: was I even there? Lots of laughter.

I actually found the local office an dat one of his appts we went and dropped it off at the front desk (child talking in bkgd). I asked and they said they had it, they were reviewing it, and they'd be in touch. They sent a letter saying we were denied.

Absolutely nothing. We didn't know where to go after that. There was no info on how to appeal, where to go… the big trouble is… in my medical records, I have nerve damage. In my records it says shin sprints. But its actually disc damage, arthritis, etc… I'm like grandfather time, I can't walk. They say you're not medically in need of help, you're able to care for yourself.

All the medical records are from the VA. As soon as I got home from the army, I went to the va, they knew there was medical records. They wanted me to go to medboard… but I didn't trust them to go through that So I got out, went straight to va. They looked at my medical records… thought I was ok. W: it was lack of info, we didn't know there was a way to appeal. H: we talked to my doctors some. But they're not really helpful as doctors… w: we decided not to fight it, I guess. 

OH, yes, Google was my best friend. Once this happened, and a lot of Fb groups with lots of caregivers (child) just a second… they helped a little with what forms I needed to use and stuff.

The va website is very complicated I feel. Using the search bar brings up not your specific va, it brings up the whole va system, so it took a lot of time. No help was given from within the va, y'know, go to here, this is the form number you need to use. It was strictly my research alone.

Oh, online (form) definitely (h&w).

Probably support for myself, along with pertinent info for him, like setting up appts, how to navigate the va system, the diff portals. Like I still have to ask him how to log in. H: the va likes to count on … the patient advocate… their intention is to rely on them a lot to give out the info to the soldiers. In my experience, the patient advocate is not on my side. I wanted to get a different doctor. They turned around and told the doctor. The nurse called me yelling me, why was I looking for a new doctor. All he info needs to be available, so ppl like us can search and get it. Those are bad apples in the system. If they're our only source of info in the system, we're screwed. Being able to log in, have diff tab, I can find what I'm looking for, it points me in the right direction. So I don't have to use Google -- it's very labor intensive.

[missed this]

W: we don't use any accessibilutyy features. [speaking to each other about this… husband said he did, wife thought we meant something else]

He's okay with it, bc he says they already have that info. I'm more hesitant. As long as it says va.gov I'm okay with it, but other websites I'm more leery.

W: we share. H: yes. Oh. W: I'm more of the reminder. H: I like it, as far as the pharmacy… when I was on a lot of meds, it made it a lot easier. I like that online interactive. Tbh, I feel like as much as I can do on my own, I would like that. Then, if I need help, I'll call someone. Right now, all this pharmacy and appts, it's pretty functional.

W: Um, I mean, I know a lot more now, since several years later. Since things have changed for him health wise, I do intend to reapply. More info on the appeal process itself.
H: what's the steps after you're denied. It can't just be a shut door. If they'd had a visit with me, they'd see there was something wrong in the paperwork, they'd see. Every doctor that's seen me has said I do not represent my medical file. It's not the same info. I mean some may be falsely denied, and they need an avenue. We haven't look recently. There may be stuff now that we're unaware of.

It's good to see that you're looking for input.
