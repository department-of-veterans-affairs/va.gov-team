## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes
Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.
-	Please tell us a little bit about yourself? Maybe start with your service experience... I Was in the US Army for a little over 3 years, Field Artillery, serviced two years in Germany and finished in Fort Bragg
-	Have you applied for a VA-backed loan before? YES
-	(If "yes") How did that go, what was your experience? Went pretty smooth.
-	(if "no") What do you know about VA home loan benefits?
-	What do you know about a VA home loan Certificate of Eligibility? Yes, I know what it is.

## First Task: Wayfinding - 5 minutes
-	Please go to VA.gov.
-	Now we're ready to start. OK, now could you share your screen with us? Yes, I can.
-	Here's a scenario: you're looking to buy a new home and a lender said you could get a Certificate of Eligibility (COE) from VA.
-	You heard there was a way on VA.gov to apply for a COE, where would you look for that? I guess I would go down to benefit letters, under records. Okay I have not signed in. 
-	Is this where you would expect to get the COE? No, this is where I would go to see if I qualify for it first. See right here it says if you want to apply, I would go there to apply. 
-	Where would you go to see the status of the COE? One second. *Scrolls page* I do not know. 
-	Do you see anything there that would be helpful? I am just looking for check for COE status, I see appeal status. I don’t know if it would be check appeals status, but I don’t know if it would be that because I did not appeal anything.
-	This is the actual home page; you're free to click on anything.

## Second Task: Complete 26-1880 - 10 minutes
-	Okay, now let's move on to the prototype.
-	We'll be using made-up scenarios that may not really apply to you, and we're using test data in the prototype.
-	Nothing will be submitted because this is a prototype.
-	I have a link in chat to the prototype we're testing; please click on it. (Clicks on prototype link to COE prototype)
-	So we'll continue with what we said earlier: you're looking to buy a new home and your lender said you could get a Certificate of Eligibility on VA.gov.
-	So you've come to this page; what do you do next? What am I looking for? What do you say I am looking for? I would push Request a COE now on the left-hand side. I guess I would verify if I already had one first. It says sign in to start your request. I would sign in at this point. I would go through and fill out all the information. Continue. Continue. Yes, I have had one. I can just put any date in this correct because I do not know the exact date.
-	What would you do if you were really filling it out? Would you look it up or just estimate? I would try to find it, but if I could not, I would just estimate. At this point I would upload my DD-214. I have a file on this tablet I am using, to upload document, and then select the document. Then I would hit continue. I have successfully submitted my request so now I need to print off the page or write the number down in case I need to talk to someone about the status of my request. 
-	What part of this that we can make this clearer? This system could tie into a VA system, and once you put social security/date of birth if you already have a VA.gov account that information could already be prepopulated. And you just have to verify the information is correct. Otherwise, it is pretty straight forward.
### Follow-up questions - 5 minutes
-	Once your COE is issued, how would you like to receive it? I will be honest, when we got our home, the lender did all this. The whole process I never went through this. I am just familiar with the VA.gov system. I might have signed to allow the request, but I did not request it. I just want my lender to be able to get it. If my lender gets it I would get a copy from my lender if not I would go to the page that you just showed me and print it out.
-	If you came back to VA.gov, where would you want that to be?
-	How could we make things easier or more clear?
-	If this was the actual VA.gov site, what would you do next?

## Third Task: Pending with uploads requested - 5 minutes
User returns to Check COE Status landing page and signs in to reveal pending status with uploads requested
Let's move on to our next task. We're going to imagine that some time has passed. You are now ready to proceed with your mortgage and want to download your COE. I've put a new link in the chat. Please click on it.
-	Take a look at this screen and describe what you see. I see check the status of your VA loan and COE, and I see the sign in to check the status.
-	(Participant signs-in) What just happened? I would sign in. It is telling me that I need to provide more document.
-	What is your next step? I would probably call the VA 1-800 number. On the bottom it says you can download the notifications letters to see what they are requesting.  They need my birth certificate. I would click here, scroll click birth certificate, and all it to upload. 
-	(Participant uploads document) What do you expect to happen now? I guess continue with process to see if that is all they needed. I would check the VA.gov in a couple days to see the status. 
-	Is there anything else we can do to make this page easier? I just did not see the letters at the bottom what documents were needed. They could put a link here to tell me what documents are needed at the top.

## Fourth Task: Download existing COE - 5 minutes
User returns to Check COE Status landing page and signs in to reveal available status
Okay, so let's imagine that some more time has passed and you've returned to va.gov to get your COE.
I've put a new link in the chat. Please click on it.
-	Take a look at this screen and describe what you see. I see review and download your COE.
-	(Participant signs-in) What just happened? I would hit download, and I would have my COE right here. When I clicked there, I actually see my COE.
-	What is your next step? Find somewhere to print it or save it.
-	If you left this page, what do you think would happen to your COE/link? I would go back to VA.gov and work my way back through VA home loans until I find my way back to COE. 
Things to watch for:
-	How quickly do users locate the "Download your COE" link?
-	What do users expect will happen to the COE/link?
-	Will the user look at their COE? How would they "save" it?
