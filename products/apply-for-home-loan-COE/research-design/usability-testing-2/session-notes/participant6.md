## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes
Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.
-	Please tell us a little bit about yourself. Maybe start with your service experience... Sure. So I spent 27 years 1990-2017 so I have been retired since then. Multiple deployments like Marines do. I am a defense contractor. I use the VA for healthcare, and I do use the websites Ebenefits and myhealthevet. 
-	Do you use any other benefits? I use the GI Bill for my daughter’s college, my son uses the Chapter 35 to help him through college. So, it is the healthcare and education. I tried the relocation rehab, but it did not work out for me and that is okay.
-	Have you applied for a VA-backed loan before? You mean the home loan? I have not that is still available to me. I will tap into that once I am ready.
-	Are you familiar with how that works? I do not, but I figured when that time comes, I will tap into my peers who have used that. If not that I will talk to a realtor who does have that experience. 
-	Have you heard of COE? Yes, I have heard of that. In the early 90s I applied and got the certificate.  I think. I do not know if I need to update or not.
-	(If "yes") How did that go, what was your experience?
-	(if "no") What do you know about VA home loan benefits?
-	What do you know about a VA home loan Certificate of Eligibility?

## First Task: Wayfinding - 5 minutes
-	Please go to VA.gov.
-	Now we're ready to start. OK, now could you share your screen with us? Yes. 
-	Here's a scenario: you're looking to buy a new home and a lender said you could get a Certificate of Eligibility (COE) from VA.
-	You heard there was a way on VA.gov to apply for a COE, where would you look for that? I would go to VA.gov, after reading this page, I see VA benefits and healthcare dropdown box, I see the housing assistance. I would scroll all the way down and click to see I am eligible for a VA back loan. Get VA home benefits dropdown, but I would keep scrolling down to see if there is any other links. Okay so I scanned through the page, then I would go back up and click on Get VA home loan benefits. It took me to this page and then I will have to see if I am eligible to apply, then I will click on the button that states go to Ebenefits to apply.
-	Where would you go look to see if you actually have a COE? I am just scrolling down the page to see if there is anything that pops out to check if I have one. I guess I may go back to check for eligibility. I would go look at the FAQs. Sometimes I would try a number to see, but those may be unsuccessful to talk to a human. I also may ask a friend or another VA center to see if they can assist me.
-	This is the actual home page; you're free to click on anything.

## Second Task: Complete 26-1880 - 10 minutes
-	Okay, now let's move on to the prototype.
-	We'll be using made-up scenarios that may not really apply to you, and we're using test data in the prototype.
-	Nothing will be submitted because this is a prototype.
-	I have a link in chat to the prototype we're testing; please click on it. (Clicks on prototype link to COE prototype)
-	So we'll continue with what we said earlier: you're looking to buy a new home and your lender said you could get a Certificate of Eligibility on VA.gov.
-	So, you've come to this page; what do you do next? I would figure out at all the sections to see where I need to click. I would expand the veteran on because that is where I fall into. That one did not respond. Okay. The other thing I am look at is all the things on the left-hand side. I would also click on the COE status. I am assuming that is linked to my social security number or my ID number to see if my COE is still available. Here after I read through the screen and checked my COE status. I would click to request a COE. You are leading me to the right answer I see.  I would click on the Find out about your VA home loan COE. I am requesting it. Sign in to request a COE or check the status. Have you requested a COE, yeah that is on the top. Oh, so it is like I thought, if I have requested one before that it will notify me that I have one already. Check my service requirements, I am good there, and request my COE. Fill out the required information and hit continue. Fill out all the information again and hit continue. Fill in information then confirm the email by filling it in again. Okay. Service history, I would select I’m a Veteran and hit continue. Service history, I will allow myself to be in the Navy today. That looks good after I fill that in. Have I ever had a VA Back loan, no. I would have to scan my DD-214 and upload it as a PDF file. I as hovering over it I have not click on the upload the document yet. I wanted to ensure that I met all the requirements to upload. I would click the file and hit open and that would upload the document. That says png not a pdf. We will assume this is the correct file and continue. I would review everything to ensure everything is correct. Read the note and click I have read the policy and hit continue. I would probably print the page or save as a pdf. I would then read down here about the 5 business days. It appears I have submitted for my COE.
-	What would you do next? I would print it off or save as a PDF. I would print a screenshot of the contact information. I would wait the 5 business days if not I would call them.
-	How would you expect for them to get in contact with you? Up here it says email.

### Follow-up questions - 5 minutes
-	Once your COE is issued, how would you like to receive it? I would assume an email, or the email would have a link for me to click on to get to the COE. The other way maybe the email would walk me through step by step how to get to where I need to go to so I would print my COE.
-	If you came back to VA.gov, where would you want that to be?
-	In this whole process, what could we do to make this clearer? That is a good question. It seems very informative I just needed to slow down to read it all. It seems simple once I got to the right page.
-	If this was the actual VA.gov site, what would you do next?

## Third Task: Pending with uploads requested - 5 minutes
User returns to Check COE Status landing page and signs in to reveal pending status with uploads requested
Let's move on to our next task. We're going to imagine that some time has passed. You are now ready to proceed with your mortgage and want to download your COE. I've put a new link in the chat. Please click on it.
-	Take a look at this screen and describe what you see.
-	(Participant signs-in) What just happened? It said to check your status, and it would bring me to this page. First thing I would have to do is sign in to check status of COE. It is not allowing me to do that. *Technical difficulties with protype* I read here they did receive it. It states that they have emailed me a notification letter. I would click on the latest one. Oh, here we go it says they need more information from me. I would expect an email stating they need more information rather than me waiting to go on here and this telling me I need more information. You can only expect so much from the VA. They need more documents so I would read to see what they need from me. I would click on each of these files to see what is needed. I would start with first one and work myself down. Please provide birth certificate. I would go back and read the next letter. It says the same thing. Third one states the same thing. 
-	What is your next step?
-	(Participant uploads document) What do you expect to happen now? I uploaded it and waited another 5 days. After they did not send me the email, I would then log in daily to check the status. I would expect to get an email to see if it is approved or not or if I am missing information that is needed. 

## Fourth Task: Download existing COE - 5 minutes
User returns to Check COE Status landing page and signs in to reveal available status
Okay, so let's imagine that some more time has passed and you've returned to va.gov to get your COE.
I've put a new link in the chat. Please click on it.
-	Look at this screen and describe what you see. I would click on download my COE, save it as a PDF, and print it. There is usually a button to print it. 
-	(Participant signs-in) What just happened?
-	What is your next step? I would right click and try to print or look on top to see if this would allow me to print. I would print it and save as a PDF first. I would email the PDF to my realtor.
-	If you left this page, what do you think would happen to your COE/link? If it did not save. I would go back to that download button. I would not close the window in fear I would lose it. I would go back and click download it. If that did not work and I couldn’t save it or print it, I would screenshot it. I would go back to the instructions to ensure I am doing that correctly.
-	Say you have closed the window and left VA.gov, how would you go back to your COE? I would think I could go log in to my VA.gov and on my home page under My VA or My Documents that have been sent to me. Maybe click on name in corner and hopefully there will be a page that gives me documents. If not, I would go back to the home loan page. This was good, and way better then I expect. I just needed to slow down and read. If you already have one the check if you already applied should be there. Other than that, I think it was very informative.
Things to watch for:
-	How quickly do users locate the "Download your COE" link?
-	What do users expect will happen to the COE/link?
-	Will the user look at their COE? How would they "save" it?
