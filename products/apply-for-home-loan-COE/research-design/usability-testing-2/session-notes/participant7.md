## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes
Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.
-	Please tell us a little bit about yourself: Sure. I am prior navy inf or 13 years got out in 2012. I finished my degree now a federal employee and my husband is still active duty but getting out soon as medically retired in the next two months. With my realtor side and their customers I have experience with their COE’s as well. 
-	Have you applied for a VA-backed loan before?  Yes, we are using our second one. We bought a house in 2011 and sold it then bought our current home in 2015 and it’s the one we are currently in now. 
-	How did that go, what was your experience? I know recently with one of my friends. he was able to do in online. I thought that was good. I can’t remember the frustrations he had but when I did it I never went online. I got my statement of service from my husbands command, no not on this one but the other one was in writing not online. I haven’t went online to do the COE but my friends have. 

## First Task: Wayfinding - 5 minutes
-	Now we're ready to start. OK, now could you share your screen with us?
-	Here's a scenario: you're looking to buy a new home and a lender said you could get a Certificate of Eligibility (COE) from VA.
-	You heard there was a way on VA.gov to apply for a COE, where would you look for that? I don’t know where to go for it so it might not work out well. Good question. I would think it would be under housing assistance, here we go I found it. how to request your COE. This page then. Do you want me to go further
-	What are you looking for here: So if I had never done it before and never done it before I would go off of someone telling me I needed it. I would follow the words of COE then click what ever applies to me. this is good on how to prepare then I would click veteran because it applies to me.
-	How do you actually apply: Here we go, go to benefits to apply. You want me to go through how to apply. 
-	What would you do here: On this page I would actually see what I need to do to prepare prior. Okay so I need my DD214 and I have that then I would go to apply. 
-	This is the actual home page; you're free to click on anything.
-	Back to va.gov: what if you have applied before but need a copy: go to how to request the COE. This is just to apply for it again. I don’t see anything that would lead me to it unless I go to my regular documents like my disability. Let me try records. IF I were looking at this the first think I would try is Download va benefit letters that where I can find the verification but I don’t know if that’s where the COE would be located. Its not clear if it is just your percent or monetary amount. I don’t know if the COE would be there. 

## Second Task: Complete 26-1880 - 10 minutes
-	So we'll continue with what we said earlier: you're looking to buy a new home and your lender said you could get a Certificate of Eligibility on VA.gov.
-	So you've come to this page; what do you do next? To actually start the process right. Click request a COE now. Oh. Clicked sign in to start request. 
-	What are you thinking: when I saw you didn’t automatically get the COE, that was not what I first thought I was looking for. I think it is backwards. If I am requesting one I would look for that first, not automatically getting one. I don’t know how I would receive one unless I already applied unless the lender triggers something for me to get one. I don’t know why I would automatically get one, I am looking to request one. It said I would receive one once I apply and if you don’t get with your lender so that being first is weird to me. Maybe the fact that the request is before following these steps. I think this should be at the top of the page, then this be there and then that be there if my thinking is correct. Even a different page, I don’t know. It is at the bottom as well, okay. maybe the top of is if you looked at everything already it is quicker., okay lets request it. 
-	Form: Its weird the finish application later, it makes you think you can click on it because it is underlines. If I click on it would it do that same as hitting continue. I would think if I say finish the application then it would take me through the steps but I don’t know what I am going through so I don’t know how many steps there are. I would be nerve, oh never mind that would save it if I hit that. 
Oh gosh that’s a lot. I know which one I am but I am thinking of other people possible. I am sure they know what they are too. I know I am a veteran. So I guess a lot of people could question it. People would wonder if when you say activated is that for my 2 week period or is that for a certain mount of days. That’s what I think of for that one. I know if my husband were to go this he would do active duty. Anyways that ones mine. I can see how someone could pick the wrong one on here. 
Do you want me to answer this as I really have. Clicked yes. I want to go back and see what it said what I would need for this because I didn’t look at everything there. If this is not there that is something I would want added there. I did actually refinance but I will but no for this. 
(reading choices) This might be one thing that someone may question and not know which one. Especially between the cash-out or interest rate reduction because they could be doing it for both. When I did mine I initially did it to get a lower interest rate but I was also cashing out. if I were doing this back in December I would not know which one to choose. 
Why did you choose that one: I guess because that is the initial reason I did the loan. Not kn0owign how it works that’s where I would go first, then I decided to do cash out. it is probably the other one because cash out would change a lot of things but for someone that didn’t know I would click the interest one. 
My first thought here is that why is it not already on file but I know they said I needed it. Will it let me go forward if I don’t add it. I would expect it not to let me go forward without adding it. That’s weird it gives all of these choices when it just wants your DD214. I could see the proof of honorable service or statement of service or annual retirement points. I don’t know why hub 1 or some of the other ones would be there because a regular person wont know what it is. It is weird they let them choose that when all it wants is proof of service. Then I expect it to let me upload the document. Okay I can see the other ones because the dd214 for some of the service then other things for proof of more service. 
Is the block just because it is a prototype. Okay. so we review everything, click read and accept, continue. Okay maybe it will keep on going. SO my first thought was the reference page and print this, for me I would basically print it as a pdf and save it but I was thinking will it be needed to have the reference number to pull my request or will anyone need it or is it there just as a number because everything has a number attached to it. Okay, back to the beginning of this and the automatic COE. I cant remember if it was on the actual va page but it said I would get it back within minutes but now this says within 5 days. I would think it would be sooner, I would have liked to know if it would be 5 business days beforehand. 

### Follow-up questions - 5 minutes
-	Once your COE is issued, how would you like to receive it? Well because it doesn’t tell me here. I would hope it would send me an email to notify me but it doesn’t say that. Knowing myself I would be looking obsessively at the website daily, not knowing if I would get an email or not
-	How could we make things easier or clearer? Where it says 5 business days. I don’t know why theres a reason to call even when its within the 5 days. I see people call for no reason. It could say once the COE is completed you will get a notification however it is given. If one is given. I guess it would relieve anxiety if there was a notification and how. 
-	If this was the actual VA.gov site, what would you do next? Check the status of it honestly.  Okay here it says it will notify you by email on how to get the COE. (reading page) 

## Third Task: Pending with uploads requested - 5 minutes
-	Take a look at this screen and describe what you see: (reading page) Clicked sign in.  So they need more infomration for me. (reading page) so here I am assuming, okay good the letters there. I am thinking they needed something it would be here. so I can find it and it would be convenient to see here what they need from me. I would feel like this should tell me what they need from me. it would say they emailed me the information below then tell me what they need and upload it. Okay so they need my birth certificate. 
-	How would you know what to upload: I would refer to the letter in the mail or I would open the letter down here. 
I would be questioning why they need it. (reading page) While I was there I would go and save all of those letters because I don’t know if I can get them else where then click upload documents. So what I am thinking right now is, is it asking me for something else that it is requesting or am I good now. If I didn’t know the answer, it says it was uploaded but it circled back to this page. I guess I feel like it is weird that it came back here instead of a closing statement.
What now: I would call someone because I would not feel comfortable. Actually I go back down and look at the letter to see if it needs something else. If it said the same thing, I worry about things like that so then I would call to make sure that’s all they needed because I wasn’t comfortable that it brought me back to the same page. 

## Fourth Task: Download existing COE - 5 minutes
-	Take a look at this screen and describe what you see: okay I am here, (reading page) Okay I would just open it to see. I got my COE. 
-	What are you thinking now: I am thinking what do I do next. I would save it or print it. I would assume this isnt there so I would go here and print it as a PDF. 
-	What would you do with it: It depends on who’s asking for it. if it is the realtor or lender. I would provide it to whoever told me that I needed it.
-	How to transmit it to them: I would email it. 
-	If you left this page, what do you think would happen to your COE/link? I would go back to housing assistance then look for something that would say where to get the COE. I would look for something that says how to review or download COE. Here it says va home loan COE then look for the download link. I don’t know if I would look under eligibility letters but I would  hope it would be under housing. If not I would go look at benefit letters. I look at the letters as disability or federal employment letters not the home loan side of it. I would look under housing first. Like the first page with education and medical. Here you needed to go to housing then find the drop down. 
The front page, let me go back there. The term housing asisiatnce threw me off at first because I was thinking if I didn’t have housing. Also like the first page, I assume that part is not the section that gets used the most so its not there . okay this is the page. I assume records, disability, healthcare, and education is what is used the most. I found it easily here but besides that the change in the simulation was good because I couldn’t find where to get one that I have already been approved for.
