## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes
Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.
-	Please tell us a little bit about yourself? I joined in 81. Retired after 20 something years, 100% disabled. Stay home most of the time.
-	Have you applied for a VA-backed loan before? Yes my house is now on a VA home.
-	(If "yes") How did that go, what was your experience? The only thing that caused me stress was I did not find out I was qualified for my loan until the day before. I took a couple months. It may have been something in my past. I was thinking it I may have not qualified. So, I continued for weeks that I was not going to be able to get it.
-	(if "no") What do you know about VA home loan benefits?
-	What do you know about a VA home loan Certificate of Eligibility? What do I know about it? I know back when I joined you had to have served for at least one-year active duty. When I joined, I went through Ebenefits to apply for mine.

## First Task: Wayfinding - 5 minutes
-	Please go to VA.gov. link: va.gov
-	Now we're ready to start. OK, now could you share your screen with us? Yes, can you see it? 
-	Here's a scenario: you're looking to buy a new home and a lender said you could get a Certificate of Eligibility (COE) from VA.
-	You heard there was a way on VA.gov to apply for a COE, where would you look for that? Okay. I would probably go to records. 
-	Go ahead and go wherever you think you would go. What are you thinking as looking at this screen? Well after looking through the other options this was the only thing that seem that it did not have to do with a health issue. See right here it says COE. If it would not have been here, I would probably would have gone to request my military records.
-	What do you think how to request a home loan would do for you? Provide me a link on how to apply for a home loan.
-	Go ahead and click on that for me. I am looking at the left-hand side of the page and it states to check the appeal status. Is there an appeal status for housing?
-	What do you think? It should all just apply to your housing. I am surprised the surviving spouse should be on the benefits page not on this page. I got a lot of letters about qualifying for a VA loan after being here for a year. I had to google about that. Funding fee and closing costs, that is good to have here because I see a lot of people asking about those. I like how these are tabbed out. 
-	If you wanted to go through the process of applying for your COE? I would click on this big nice green button.
-	This is the actual home page; you're free to click on anything.

## Second Task: Complete 26-1880 - 10 minutes
-	Okay, now let's move on to the prototype. link: uxpin landing page
-	We'll be using made-up scenarios that may not really apply to you, and we're using test data in the prototype.
-	Nothing will be submitted because this is a prototype.
-	I have a link in chat to the prototype we're testing; please click on it. (Clicks on prototype link to COE prototype)
-	So we'll continue with what we said earlier: you're looking to buy a new home and your lender said you could get a Certificate of Eligibility on VA.gov.
-	So you've come to this page; what do you do next? Request a COE now. I would click on that. 
-	What are you thinking when clicking on this page? I didn’t click on this page on the other site, but I like this page. I have a lot of information, and it is very simple. 
-	If you wanted to request your COE, what would you do now? I would click here to request COE. So, did my lender send me here?
-	Yes, your lender sent you to this page to request a COE online. I would then do it online. It seems that you should just get everyone to do it this way to avoid all the issues doing it with paperwork. Knowing me, this looks like a lot of information. I would look for the documents I would need for the request. I would come here and request a COE. I like how it gives a timeline of how long it may take. Would this just populate with my information from VA.gov? *Yes, it would. * What if you were a Veteran previously active duty? Does that make a difference here? It seems like it is saying only with National Guard or Reserves. I would separate those. I would hit continue. So, I would upload my DD214 right here.
-	What are you thinking by wanting to upload more than one document? Well, I could have served in active duty and in reserves/National Guard.
-	What makes you think you need to add multiple documents here? Because it is asking for additional documents. 
-	Normally that yellow box would not be there. So, you are just confirming all the information is correct. Nice, it is giving you a timeline of how long it may take to hear back, a phone to get in contact with them, and a link.

### Follow-up questions - 5 minutes
-	Once your COE is issued, how would you like to receive it? Electronically 
-	If you came back to VA.gov, where would you want that to be? The way it did get there is through VA.gov, back when I applied for this loan. I don’t think it came through email, but I did upload and save it in case I needed to provide it for someo.ne. If I requested through VA.gov I would expect to be notified by VA.gov
-	How could we make things easier or clearer?
-	If this was the actual VA.gov site, what would you do next? Is the email my personal email or the secure messaging? Hopefully my personal email. I wouldn’t print this page, but other may.

## Third Task: Pending with uploads requested - 5 minutes
User returns to Check COE Status landing page and signs in to reveal pending status with uploads requested
Let's move on to our next task. We're going to imagine that some time has passed. You are now ready to proceed with your mortgage and want to download your COE. I've put a new link in the chat. Please click on it.
-	Take a look at this screen and describe what you see. I would log in through the home page and navigate through. Then I would click on check the status of my COE. We need documents from you. Okay I do not know what the letter said. Apparently, I am missing something, but I don’t know what. Where are the documents listed, here or the email? What are you expecting here? Something to tell me what I am missing. From what I am looking at here it looks as if I am missing everything. Instead of listing all these just lists what I am missing.
-	Do you see anything else that may tell you on the page what you are missing? Well down here it states we need more documentation from you and has a link. It says they emailed me a notification. Okay this says I need a birth certificate. I go to here upload my birth certificate, and if more documents were needed, I could just keep uploading them here. 
-	(Participant signs-in) What just happened?
-	What is your next step?
-	Where would you go to find out what you need to upload.
-	(Participant uploads document) What do you expect to happen now? It does not give me a done button, go back to home button, or anything explanation of what to do next. I would just go back to home. 
-	When would you follow up to ensure they have everything they need? Another five days based on this. 
-	How would you expect them to follow up? I would think email, but I would come back to VA.gov to check as well. I would do that before I call.

## Fourth Task: Download existing COE - 5 minutes
User returns to Check COE Status landing page and signs in to reveal available status
Okay, so let's imagine that some more time has passed and you've returned to va.gov to get your COE.
I've put a new link in the chat. Please click on it.
-	Take a look at this screen and describe what you see.
-	(Participant signs-in) What just happened?
-	What is your next step? I would download it, save it to my important documents, and then send it to my lender. I would upload it to an email to send to my lender. Well, I shouldn’t say that because my lender required me to upload it on their website. One of the documents was my COE. 
-	If you left this page, what do you think would happen to your COE/link? The same way. Right here. Would someone request that again? I never thought that may happened, but I could see how it could get confusing.
-	What could we do to make it clearer or easier? I was impressed that you could do this online. I thought it may be difficult dealing with the VA, but it was very easy and took about a month. 
-	Do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or family members that would be interested in studies like this? No but if I run into anyone, I do tell them to sign up.
