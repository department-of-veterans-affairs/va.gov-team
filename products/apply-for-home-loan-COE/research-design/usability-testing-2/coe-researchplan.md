# Research Plan for eBenefits Migration, Certificate of Eligibility (COE), March 2022

## Background
Veterans and service members (and surviving spouses) need a VA-issued Certificate of Eligibility (COE) get a VA-backed home loan or Native American Direct Loan (NADL). The requirements for obtaining VA loans are service-based, and a COE confirms for lenders that an applicant qualifies for this benefit, and the amount to which the recipient is backed. Specific individual requirements depend on service dates and details.

There are several ways a Veteran or service member can apply for and receive a COE. The online Certificate of Eligibility feature (VA From 26-1880) is being migrated from eBenefits to VA.gov in an effort to consolidate Veteran self-service tools -- and to sunset the eBenefits site.

The [first usability study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/apply-for-home-loan-COE/research-design/usability-testing-1) examining core functionality was tested in July 2021. Since that time, a new view tool has been added.

### OCTO Objectives
The Certificate of Eligibility feature will support the following OCTO Goals:

1. Veterans and their families can apply for all benefits online
3. Logged-in users can easily track applications, claims, or appeals online
4. Logged-in users can update their personal information easily and instantly
5. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
6. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

### Veteran Journey
Veterans are likely to be impacted throughout their journey, particularly in the “getting out”, “starting up”, “taking care of myself”, and “putting down roots” parts of their journey.

## Research Goals
The goals of this usability study are to:
1. Assess the usability of the Request a Certificate of Eligibility form
2. Explore users' understanding of the View Your COE tool and statuses they could encounter

### Outcome
This research will allow us to assess design fitness to move this feature to staging review.

### Research questions
- Can users successfully complete the form to request a COE?
- Can users successfully update their information in the request form?
- Do users understand how and when to follow up on their COE request?
- Can users successfully download their COE PDF?
- Can users successfully upload required documentation?
- Where do users expect to find the View Your COE tool?
- Where do users expect to find their COE if they already have one?
- Do users understand the status they might encounter?
- What other features or content would help users when they apply for a COE?

### Hypothesis
- Users will initially look for a direct link in the white quadrant on the home page; many will locate COE landing page after several steps
- The form itself will be relatively easy for users to navigate
- Biographical, contact and service language will be clear to most users; the language around loan options and COE intent will be somewhat confusing
- Users will be able to download their COE if their status is Available or Auto, but may not recognize that there is additional action needed if their status is Pending with letters or uploads requested.
- Users will expect their COE to be available in various ways: physical letter, email, printed, and/or within an authenticated profile/dashboard
- Users will ask for directly available information (chat, direct phone, lookups) about the COE, lenders and /or realtors

## Method
We'll engage in moderated usability testing. Participants will be recruited using Perigean. These users will be asked to explore VA.gov (home), then will be provided links to a prototype of the COE feature (VA From 26-1880). The prototype is likely to include some facsimile of the landing page. Users will be given open-ended "tasks" set forth in the conversation guide, and their actions and feedback will be recorded. Observers and notetakers may be in attendance.

### Location
Sessions will be conducted remotely using Zoom.

### Research materials
For moderated usability tests:

## Recruitment
### Recruitment approach
Veterans will be recruited through Perigean, requesting participants that fulfill OCTO’s maximum variation strategy.

### Recruitment criteria
We request 6 fulfilled sessions.

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
- Participants must receive some type of VA payments

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
To maximize variation in our sampling, we would like to have:
- 2 users age 55-64+
- 2 users with a cognitive disability
- 1 user with no degree
- 1 Black user
- 1 Hispanic user
- 1 LGBTQ+ user
- ~~1 users on mobile devices~~*
- ~~1 users using assistive technology~~*

* This round of testing will be conducted using a UXPin prototype, which currently does not support assistive technology or mobile devices.

## Timeline
### Prepare
The core functionality of the prototype is complete now. Details to support scenarios in the conversation guide will be added by March 9.

Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session.
* Pilot participant email: TBD
* Date and time of pilot session: TBD

### Research sessions
We are planning to test March 11-18.

### Length of sessions
Please schedule sessions as 1 hour blocks with at least 30 minutes between sessions. Please do not schedule more than 3 sessions per day.
