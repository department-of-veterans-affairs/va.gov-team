This topline summary is a high-level, top-of-mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but it's not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.

### The goals of this document are to:

- Make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
- Gain insight from team/stakeholders/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
- Jump-start synthesis by quickly organizing high-level themes

## Participants and testing sessions

We scheduled 12 sessions beginning Monday, June 14; the last session was conducted Monday, June 21. Five of the 12 participants attended.

## Initial findings

### When looking for the COE feature, participants primarily looked to white quads, specifically to the “Records” box, to find the COE tool.
- Users seems to gravitate toward the "Download your benefit letters" link
- One user utilized search, one used mega menu
- Two users found the COE landing page
- Two participants saw COE links at the bottom of the letters screen
- It seems participants mentally connected a COE--which is a benefit document--with other benefits documents and expected they would be together on VA.gov

### On the COE intro screen, the sign-in widget generally distracted users from reviewing intro screen content.
- All five users signed-in before seeing the subway map or reading the auto COE blurb
- One user did scroll to the bottom of the page, but only noted the estimated time to complete as useful after prompting

### Participants generally accepted the auto COE screen's presentation and functionality
- All users understood what they "received/found" their COE, even if they didn’t understand where they were redirected from the intro to a standalone page (P11 skipped the auto COE flow)
- One user seemed to understand the auto COE screen to be a different page
- All users on the auto COE screen found the COE download link and the COE PDF (P11 skipped the auto COE flow)
- Three users said they would print their COE, and two said they would also save it to email to their lender

### It was not clear to all users that they needed to "apply" to make changes.
- When asked to "make changes," all users **did** enter the form using the "apply" action link, though most felt the labeling was wrong 
- Most users recognized they linked for the auto COE screen back to the form
- Only one participant read the "make changes" text, but didn’t understand that they needed to "apply" to make the change

`There are good quotes from the first and last (?) users that show the range of understanding here.`

### Loan intent and document uploads were the two panels that slowed users down.
 - All users were confident of their choices on the "loan intent" screen, but all paused to talk through the options
 - Only one user felt there should be more info to clarify loan intent options
 - Almost all participants proceeded successfully through the uploader screen
 - Most users did see the list of which documents needed to be uploaded, though some said it could be more prominent
 - One participant missed the "What kind of document are you uploading?" dropdown and could not continue
 - One user said having to upload a DD214 would cause them to abandon the form

### Participants had varying ideas of where they'd find their COE if they returned to VA.gov
- Three participants said they go to the benefits records page 
- One user expected a COE would be available in their logged-in profile 

## Summary
The independent COE screen and the form itself seemed to function well for participants--but the connection between the two needs better established for users. Some content refinements and clarification would help on the intro screen and within the form. Users seem to expect VA-issued documents to be together on a "My documents" kind of screen; the existing "Benefits letters" page seem a natural home for a COE. The size and position of the sing-in widget obsured intro page content; only one user scrolled below it to see the subway map.
