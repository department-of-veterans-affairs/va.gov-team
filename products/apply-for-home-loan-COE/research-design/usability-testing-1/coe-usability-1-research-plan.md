# Certificate of eligibility (COE) usability testing research plan
**VSA eBenefits Team | June 2021**

#### Background

Veterans and service members (and surviving spouses) need a VA-issued Certificate of Eligibility (COE) get a VA-backed home loan or Native American Direct Loan (NADL). The requirements for obtaining VA loans are service-based, and a COE confirms for lenders that an applicant qualifies for this benefit, and the amount to which the recipient is backed. Specific individual requirements depend on service dates and details.

There are several ways a Veteran or service member can apply for and receive a COE. The online Certificate of Eligibility feature (VA From 26-1880) is being migrated from eBenefits to VA.gov in an effort to consolidate Veteran self-service tools -- and to sunset the eBenefits site. Core functionality of the exiting feature will be preserved; other features may be added in subsequent iterations.

### Goals

The goal of this usability study is to assess how easily participants locate and apply for a Certificate of Eligibility in a VA.gov-based tool/form.

#### Guiding questions
- Starting on the VA.gov home page, where do users expect to find the COE tool, and what path do they take?
- How do users feel about the "automatic COE" feature; what are their expectations about it future availability (access, printing, download)?
- What barriers int the UX and UI prevent users from easily applying for a COE?
- Where does confusing language prevent users from understanding the form?
- Where (on VA.gov and elsewhere) do users expect to have their COE available after it has been granted?
- What other features or content would help users when they apply for a COE?

#### Hypotheses
- Users will initially look for a direct link in the whit quadrant on the home page; many will locate COE landing page after several steps
- The form itself will be relatively easy for users to navigate
- Biographical, contact and service language will be clear to most users; the language around loan options and COE intent will be somewhat confusing
- Users will expect their COE to be available in various ways: physical letter, email, printed, and/or within an authenticated profile/dashboard
- Users will ask for directly available information (chat, direct phone, lookups) about the COE, lenders and /or realtors

### Method
We'll engage in moderated usability testing conducted remotely using Zoom. Participants will be recruited using Perigean. These users will be asked to explore VA.gov (home), then will be provided links to a prototype of the COE feature (VA From 26-1880). The prototype is likely to include some facsimile of the landing page. Users will be given open-ended "tasks" set forth in the conversation guide, and their actions and feedback will be recorded. Observers and notetakers may be in attendance.

#### The process
- There will be a quick warm-up and introduction to usability testing
- The user will be asked to navigate to VA.gov
- The moderator will outline a scenario (use case) for the participant to follow
- The participant be will asked to locate the COE feature
- After a brief period exploring a path to the COE tool, the users will be provided a link to the COE prototype
- The user will potentially proceed through review of the form intro and on to complete the form itself
- There will be a quick Q/A and wrap-up
