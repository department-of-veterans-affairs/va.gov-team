## Research Goals
The goal of this usability study is to assess how easily participants locate and apply for a Certificate of Eligibility in a VA.gov-based tool/form, including:
- Where do users expect to find the COE tool?
- How do users feel about the “automatic COE” feature?
- What do users expect regarding future availability of their COE?
- What barriers prevent users from easily applying for a COE?
- Where does confusing language prevent users from understanding the form?
- What other features or content would help users when they apply for a COE?

## Research Methodology

We conducted moderated task-based user research sessions via Zoom June 14-21, 2021. Each session was approximately 45 minutes long and consisted of a few warm-up questions, a wayfinding task on va.gov, and three tasks within a UXPin prototype. This allowed us to explore veteran expectations and understanding of the COE process and assess the usability of the form.

Our hypotheses were:
- Users will initially look for a direct link in the whit quadrant on the home page; many will locate COE landing page after several steps
- The form itself will be relatively easy for users to navigate
- Biographical, contact and service language will be clear to most users; the language around loan options and COE intent will be somewhat confusing
- Users will expect their COE to be available in various ways: physical letter, email, printed, and/or within an authenticated profile/dashboard
- Users will ask for directly available information (chat, direct phone, lookups) about the COE, lenders and /or realtors

### Research Questions

- Where do users expect to find the COE tool?
- How do users feel about the “automatic COE” feature?
- What do users expect regarding future availability of their COE?
- What barriers prevent users from easily applying for a COE?
- Where does confusing language prevent users from understanding the form?
- What other features or content would help users when they apply for a COE?

## Key Findings
1. Participants expected to be able to access the COE feature through the “Records” white quadrant on the va.gov homepage.
2. Participants accepted the auto COE presentation and functionality. The sign-in widget distracted users from reviewing intro screen content.
3. Participants had varying ideas of where they’d find their COE when complete.
4. The sign-in widget distracted users from reviewing intro screen content.
5. Loan intent and document upload panels slowed users down.
6. It was not clear to all users that they needed to “apply” to make changes.

## Details of Findings
1. When asked where they would go to apply for a Certificate of Eligibility, the most frequently used location was the “Download your benefit letters” link in the “Records” quadrant. Two users found the COE landing page and two participants saw the COE links at the bottom of the letters screen. It seems participants connected the COE, which is a benefit document, with other benefits and expected they would be together on VA.gov.
    - Let me see, I think I would go to benefit letters. (Participant 9)
    - Probably the records... It's not in education, health care, nor disability. Here, download benefit letters. (Participant 11)
2. All users understood that they had “received” or “found” their COE, even if they didn’t understand that they had been redirected from the intro to a standalone page. One user skipped the auto COE flow. Only one of the 4 participants that saw the auto COE seemed to understand that the auto COE was a different page. All four users on the auto COE screen found the COE download link and the PDF.
    - It is the same thing, download link there that is nice. (Participant 1)
    - What just happened? It basically said I have everything I need and don’t need to apply, then click right there. It's my COE. it makes it very easy. (Participant 10)
3. Three participants said they would go to the benefits records page and one user expected a COE to be available in their logged in profile.
    - I have it bookmarked. I think if I go to the VA main it pulls it up for me. (Participant 1)
    - Back to the screen that it has the records on it. (Participant 9)
4. All five participants signed-in before seeing the subway map or reading the automatic COE content. One user did scroll to the bottom of the page, but only noted the estimated time to complete as useful after the moderator asked if there was any information on the screen that was useful. There was no indication that the user read any of the other content.
    - (Moderator prompts: You scrolled down; did you see anything that was relevant?) The burden of time, 15 minutes, glad to see that it's not long.... I guess sign in. (Participant 11)
5. All users were confident of their choices on the “loan intent” screen, but all paused to talk through the options. Only one user felt there should be more info to clarify those options. Four of five participants proceeded successfully through the document uploader screen, though only one user clearly noted that they had seen the list of documents that needed to be uploaded. One participant missed the “What kind of document are you uploading?” dropdown and could not continue. One user said having to upload a DD214 would cause them to abandon the form and one user questioned why they had to upload their DD214 again when the VA already has it.
    - If I were applying for a new loan, I would click a restoration of entitlement. I am not looking for cash out finance or interest rate reduction I am just applying right now. (Participant 7)
    - I would determine what am I using this COE for - am I using it to cash out refinance, restoration of eligibility, or yeah... just buy a new house (selects "A restoration of entitlement") (Participant 11)
    - I would click on upload a document... if it didn’t work, I would need to go backwards I guess. [I need] a copy of the DD214... and I have a copy on my laptop so I would find it and load it. (Participant 7, Note: Participant didn't find the doc type selection box that would enable the upload button.)
    - Why did you need my 214? I've already given it to the VA 14 times. Let me go track it down again. It's not one that I keep on me all the time.... Because the systems don't talk to each other. Like the compensation doesn't talk to let's say the GI bills section or something like that. You'd kinda think that they would. (Participant 11)
6. All users *did* enter the form using the “apply” action link, but most stumbled over the labeling. Only one participant read the “make changes” text, but didn’t understand that they needed to “apply” to make the change. Additionally, most users recognized they linked from the auto COE screen back to the form.
    - It looks like it is taking me to the initial application again. I don’t see an option to make the change... I would assume it is going through the application process again but that is based on the non-stop dealing with the VA. If I were unfamiliar with the process I would be lost at this point. (Participant 1)
    - I would go to make a change and click the form. It says you can make changes to the form.... If I needed to make changes, I would download the form.  There is apply and then it says eligibility requirements. I don’t see anything. (Participant 9)

## Additional Insights
The independent COE screen and the form itself seemed to function well for participants--but the connection between the two needs better established for users. Some content refinements and clarification would help on the intro screen and within the form. Users seem to expect VA-issued documents to be together on a "My documents" kind of screen; the existing "Benefits letters" page seem a natural home for a COE. The size and position of the sign-in widget obscured intro page content; only one user scrolled below it to see the subway map.

## Recommendations
- Revise content on intro screen to emphasize COE process - automatic vs applying through a new form
- Refine content to "make changes" and/or "apply" action link to clarify that users need to apply to make changes
- Provide greater emphasis on the documents to upload list; place the list closer to the "What kind of document are you uploading?" dropdown and the uploader button
- Move the sign-in widget to the bottom of the page (per conversations with Sitewide Content team)
- Add COE to the existing "Benefits letters" page
- Consider making LGY call when user clicks the button to enter the form--vs. on sign-in (or navigating to page signed-in)

## Next Steps
- Make content and design revisions to prototype
- Move the sign-in widget to the bottom of the page (per conversations with Sitewide Content team)
- Investigate option to add COE to the existing "Benefits letters" page
