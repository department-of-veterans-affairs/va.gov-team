## Warm-up
**M:** We're good. Thank you. Okay, so we'll start out just, uh, if you would tell us a little bit about yourself, maybe starting with your service history.

**P3:** I was in the military from July 2005. to July of 2009. combat. I served in Afghanistan. Now I am a military spouse. My husband is active duty. I'm I'm in school right now for my doctorate. Three children, ranging from three to 18. Yeah, that's, I think that's about it.

**M** Wow, that's enough. Uh, going with three kids. First of all three kids is enough. But going for your doctorate. That's a workload right there. Yes. Okay. So we're here to talk about the VA loan process. I've got another person I'm going to let in here we go. All right. So you have applied for a VA back loan or a VA direct loan in the past?

**P3:** Yes.

## Section one: The loan process
**M** Okay. Do you? Do you remember how you found out about VA loan benefits? Um,

**P3:** it was part of the out processing when I was in the military.

**M** Okay. Sounds good. So there was like there was tapper or something where they Yeah. Okay, sounds good. Do you remember when you apply for the loan? Um, what the steps were in the process, just kind of the big parts? How did it go? Well,

**P3:** the first thing was I had to find someone to finance the loan, then I had to do the CLE, the Sif, it's the certificate of eligibility. From there, it was pretty much smooth sailing. But when I printed out the original CEO, he they told me that, because it was computer generated the way it came out, um, that that wasn't good enough. So then I had to contact the VA through the 800 number, and get an original document. It was a man.

**M** Whoo. Okay, so it sounds like you had a problem and the problem centered on how the SEO was generated. Okay. So, with that in mind, how did you generate that Seo? We did you do it through a web site? Or was there some other way? No, I

**P3:** did it through a benefits. Okay. Gotcha.

**M** So that is the exactly the tool that we're talking about here. So we'll talk a little bit about that in just a minute then like to find out some details. So you say it was smooth sailing after you get the cod squared away?

**P3:** Yes.

**M** What was the biggest help? What? What made it go so well?

**P3:** I had used a roller coaster that my brother had previously used. So that was, yeah, that was, yeah, they already knew what I was looking for a friend in the business, and that made the process go a lot better. 

**M** Yeah. Okay. In the course of applying loan, you say that it was all smooth sailing, anything go particularly really well, any step of the process that you could say, well, you know, this was easy. No, I mean, yeah, yeah. Good. That is good. I can't say that everybody I know has had that experience. But we were two for two. Today, we've got two people that we've talked to that have had just, you know, smooth sailing all the way through. So you mentioned the CSV, are there any other issues that may have popped up in that process besides the UI? Or is that

**P3:** at the time I had to get do the tournament form for my disability rating to count for my income, but again, because it was generated through EA benefits and didn't have like the official stamp? Or wasn't the what they considered the official award letter, I had to go through the process again, contacted the 800 number, um, and they were just kind of like, Oh, well, we can send out a letter, but it won't be sealed to so that took, yeah, that was that was a holy fit.

**M** So that was another piece of documentation. 

**P3:** Yes, because the original award letter was dated more than a year, so I couldn't use it. Right.

**M** So you had to get a new one. Okay. Um, so in? Well, we'll probably touch on that a little bit, too, because I'm very interested about documentation and documentation requirements, but thinking about your home buying process in general. Were there any other tools that you used? Besides you mentioned, he benefits and then you had a friend of the business Were there any other things that you used online or in the real world that took you through the process?

**P3:** I attempted to use the what is it united Veterans Association situations that like had veterans, like they're getting, they're supposed to be geared towards veterans like the relative and helping you do this stuff. But I found out a lot of those places wanted money up front, or they get like huge commissions for working with me or whatever. So like, it's like the companies that just put veterans in their name to Lloris to them only to find out that they're not military friendly.

**M** Right. Okay. Is that like a website that you went to to find these?

**P3:** Yep. Um, I think it's like united veterans or something.

## Section two: COE
Unknown Speaker  5:32  
That's okay. That's okay. And it sounds like they weren't completely upfront about whether we're veteran friendly or not? Well, I'm glad you figured that one out. Because that, you know, those are the sorts of stories that don't end up well, a lot of times. Okay. Well, we're going to move on and talk a little bit more about that certificate of eligibility. Like I said, that's the thing that we're, we're kind of centering on at this point, because it's the future any benefits. Can you just tell us in general, what that certificate of eligibility is?

**P3:** What is its guarantee and a portion of my loan? I'm pretty much saying that I have back in by the VA for a specified amount.

**M:** Okay. And you got yours by way of E benefits? How did you know to go to E benefits to generate that Co Op?

**P3:** My brother?

**M:** Okay. He said, yeah, go there. And that's is that the friend in the business? Your brother? Okay, cool. That's pretty close ties, right there.

**P3:** Yes.

**M:** So you had mentioned there were some challenges in getting your CSV, just getting it itself? generating the piece of paper not not thinking about Ooh, it's not official, and it didn't work for you just generating it?

**M:** Because it's, it's a lot of steps that you have to go through. Okay, um, instead of it being? And this was 20.

**P3:** Maybe 2015? Yeah, about 2015. Like, it wasn't separated inside the system. So you have to go through, like, you had to go through a bunch of steps to find their certificate, or whatever. And then like, when once you generate it, um, it has like, the amount of $36,000 on it. So it's like, okay, are they only helping me with $36,000? So for novice, it was hard. Okay. So there were a lot of steps involved to actually just even get to it. And then when, you

**M:** know, you had some questions about what you saw on it that you couldn't answer.

**P3:** Yes. And then when you call the 800 number, or try to use the help desk, and he benefits or whatever, it's, nothing happens. Hmm.

**M:** Okay. Mmm hmm. No, no, in the end, I mean, this story has a happy ending. You got it worked out? Yes. What, what steps did you have to go through to get this corrected? So the CEO, he was printed out, it was not official, and you had some questions about you call the 800 number, or you got ahold of me benefits. And that didn't work? How did you finally get that document itself.

**P3:** And it took about four to five calls, to a benefits, um, just to just to even get like the correct document. And then it took an additional because the relative knew what we were talking about. But I was still confused. And the relative tried to break it down to me, but it was, I didn't pretty much understand some of the stuff that was going on. Um, so I literally had to go to a VSO, which was far from my house to get a clear understanding, um, and the VA, the USO actually printed out all of the documentation and sent it for me, but the VA had sent it in the mail too. But of course, I got the VSO stuff before I got the VA information.

**M:** Okay. Well, it sounds like it, would you have a lot of different things going on. So he benefits was your first stop? Yes. And then the lender knew what was going on and knew what the CEO he was all about what to look for, but you contacted VA, but by the time they got to you with the correct documentation, you had gone to a VSO and they went through their system. Yeah, squared away. Okay. In the end, did you have all your questions answered about what was on that CSV? Yes. And who answered those questions,

**P3:** the Bs,

**M:** so, okay, so they knew the answers to everything had. Okay. Um, so, in terms of cod, just in general, you do you know, what requirements there are to get a certificate of eligibility.

**P3:** I know that you have to have honorable discharge. I think it was, um, I know he had to have an honorable discharge. I think that's all I know. Um, because I don't think it was. I don't think it was a time in service required. may or may not have been the same time and service requirement as the GI Bill.

**M:** Okay, so you do no honorable discharge would be one and then maybe some other things having to do with the time and era of service?

**P3:** Yes.

**M:** Okay. Did you have to, like fill out a form when you're at the VSO for this to get this certificate of eligibility? or How did they take your information when

**P3:** they get a release of information?

**M:** Right. Okay. So you provided that to them, and they use that information entered in their system. Is that right? Yes. Okay. That makes sense. Okay, I have kind of a detail question thrown out there. And you may not have the answer, and that's fine. But we just want to find out. There is on the CSV, something about funding fee, and it gives a status for your funding fee. Do you know anything about that, like why it's important, and why it's not. Okay. And that's just like I said, it's a detail. We're just trying to see what the awareness level is there. So you mentioned, let's see that you had other documentation that you had to record supply it had to do with your disability rating? Yes. All right. And you say that it caused some problems. Can you be more detailed about that?

**P3:** When the original award letter that I received was dated, like 18 months? out, so when they made it, an official letter, but the one that's generated through and he benefits, it's just like a regular piece of paper, and it was like, you know, they've had people tamper with it in the past, or whatever. So I needed the official letter from the VA. But I'm the only official.

**M:** I'm sorry, go ahead.

**P3:** Oh, good. The only official letter was the one that's generated through the benefits.

**M:** Right. Okay. So the letter that was generated, and you had mentioned this before, kind of slipped my mind. But first off, it was you had a document and it was just past date. So you needed to do so you went to the benefits, and it just did not. It didn't have the official seal, it wasn't on letterhead, or whatever it was that made it official, is that right? That's where the problem came in. And you got that solved by going to calling the 800 number.

**P3:** I called the 800 number, but by the time they received a letter from them, I had already went to the VSO. And so

**M:** yeah, okay, gotcha. So the VSO helped you with the disability rating paperwork to justify the income as well. Okay. All right. Now, knowing what you you know, having gone through that process about certificate of eligibility, looking back, is there anything that you would do differently, knowing how the process would go.

**P3:** But one is to fully understand everything that surrounds the CLE, because the way it was explained to us is, hey, you just print this piece of paper out, you give it to your relatives, and everything will go great. And we'll know what to do with it, when in actuality, that's not how it goes. Because like, the the form has a set amount on there. If you don't know what that amount means, then you're out of luck. And, you know, it doesn't tell us about, um, like, I'm from Illinois. So it doesn't tell us about the different benefits that you get in your state of being a homeowner or disabled veteran and being a homeowner. So that opens up a whole nother can of worms.

**M:** That's kind of interesting there too, because so you're saying state by state that they're going to be different? Like, you might have some different rules or some different benefits for veterans. And Illinois has some different benefits. And you'd like to know about those two?

**P3:** Yes.

**M:** Okay. That's good insight. We haven't heard that yet. All right. What could we on the VA side do to make that certificate of eligibility easier for you to get?

**P3:** It should be so when you go into m. e benefits, or the new VA website, everything has a component, it needs to stand out by itself. Um, instead of being here hid in between clicks, like you got to click here, you got to click there, you got to go there into those are a lot of steps for people that is not tech savvy.

**M:** Right. definitely understand that. So you're saying it takes it, it's hidden, kind of Yes, are defined and once you find a lot of clicks to get to it, okay, that is definitely one of the things that we're trying to make better. So it's, it's good that you tell us that too. Because you're right. Quite a few people are not super tech savvy, and they need to get to these things and as few clicks as possible, so we'll keep that one in mind for sure.

**P3:** You should have like its own tab. That's straightforward. Like you know, on the homepage, you know, you click on it, you and you're going to get what you need. Okay,

**M:** well, that is good feedback. Alright, so at this point, I think we're going to go ahead and move on to tools in, in features just kind of in general, you know, some of the VA websites that we've got out there. When you are talking about your experiences with a website, you mentioned, he benefits quite a bit. And then you mentioned the new site, which is va.gov. So what experiences have you had some, maybe some good ones, and some bad ones with VA websites? Can you tell us a little bit about those,

**P3:** um, well, so once, so once I've met, benefits, they came out with the new website, which was a little off putting, because all of the information is not there yet, as of yet. Um, but once you know how to use the website, it's fairly easy, but it's the process of learning how to use the website, and knowing where to find the information. And then like an E benefits, um, the side panel doesn't match the top panel. So the information that you can receive from the top panel is different, even though they're labeled the same, it's different than what you'll get off the side panel. Um, with the va.gov. The problem with that is, it doesn't have all the information that he benefits has just yet. Um, and so now you're forced to do three different websites to get all of the information, you have to use the benefits my healthy vet, and va.gov to get any information,

**M:** right. Definitely a big problem there to have everything across all these different sites. And that's, that is what we're trying to do. So you hit it on the head, we're trying to bring it all together in one spot, but you had some good insights in there about the maybe the navigation at the top and on the side, not taking to the same places, but having the same labels. Those are the those are good things for us to make note of because it's important. You know, like I said, Not everybody's super tech savvy and can click back and forth. So

**P3:** yeah, I'm actually I'm helping one of my husband's Oh sergeants apply for his stuff, apply for his home loan, and everything. And how I ended up helping him is he literally got lost, and he benefits. He's like the information. I clicked where you told me to click, it's not there. And he's about 5560. So like, for him, this is like, What in the world?

**M:** Right? Okay, so navigating back and forth is something that maybe we should pay attention to, and, and just make sure that that's clear. Okay. So in backing out a step or two and just talking again, about that, that VA loan process, is there anything we could do to make getting a VA loan easier, just in general, whether it's online or in the real world,

**P3:** I think one thing that would be great is to have trusted affiliates, because there's a lot of things just geared towards veterans or people put veteran name in it, to lure us to them. And a lot of people lose money, and they lose like downpayments. And they're paying, like outrageous costs. So to have someone that's truly affiliated and vetted for veterans would be awesome. Um, and having someone breakdown in inside of tests, um, my husband is going through the process now of getting out the military as well. And talking about the home loan is like a blip of the information they get, they literally talked about it for two minutes. And that was it.

**M:** Alright, so I've heard a couple of times you talk about, you know, having a trusted source, because it sounds like there's a lot of people out there that are unscrupulous, and they're gonna try to, you know, show up in Google and take your your business away, and they're not really working in your best interest. So you would like to see a some sort of List of trusted lenders or trusted resources, is that, is that, okay? And then spending a little more time in, we may, that may be a little bit out of our scope to talk about, you know, that out processing, but

**P3:** even with calling the 800 number, and talking to them about getting the the certificate of eligibility. If the representatives that's on the other line of that, that call, they don't really have a lot of information either.

**P3:** Okay, that is something that we can work with. Because it's kind of like you have this form, and nobody knows what to do with it unless you find somebody that knows what to do with it, but you don't know enough to find them. Right?

**M:** Yeah, that is actually part of our our mission is to make sure that the call centers have the documentation that they need so that we can you know, that's good into good insight, good feedback. So we'll Put that in, you know our findings as well. So that's very important. So thank you for that. So we've talked a little bit about the process and making getting a certificate of eligibility a little bit simpler. It sounds, you said that you, once you got past a couple of these speed bumps that your home buying process went pretty well. But looking at it in total with the speed bumps, is there anything that you if you were like to make your own ideal process that you would change?

**P3:** I will change how to get the CLE I think that you should be issued one just like you're issued your dd 214 it should come standard. Um, and like I said, a lot of people don't a lot of military people getting out the military, they know that they have a housing benefit, but they don't necessarily know what it is. So to get the form when you're leaving the military with the breakdown of telling you what these numbers mean, and what the wording means, kind of like your dd 214 would streamline the process.

**M:** Okay, that is good. That is good feedback. Well, the last question that I have about just the general tools and features is, again, thinking about the process, if somebody were to come to you, and apparently you are, you know, a resource for a lot of people. What advice do you typically give people who were looking for the, for a VA loan?

**M:** Find a realtor, or I tell people all the time, start with the VSO, because that's where I got the help that I needed from, because telling people to call the 800 number, or to use a benefits when they're not familiar with what's happening there. It's pointless. So I always tell people to start with the VSO because they work with this a lot. And they know the answers to the questions that you're going to ask, because they've been asked them 1000 times, because like I said, the 800 number, depending on who you get, they have no idea what you're talking about. And he benefits while it generates the information, it doesn't give you a breakdown of the information that it's generating.

## Section three: tools and features
**M:** Okay, now, that sounds good, too. We hear that quite a bit where, you know, basically, VSOs are really good resource. They do this all the time. They've done it 1000 times. And so they're they're able to kind of pick up where the websites and some of the other information fall short. So that's good. Okay, well, that is pretty much all I have for loans, certificate of eligibility, and some other tools. So I've hit everything on my list. Is there anything else that you would like for us to know either about what we've talked about today, VA home loan Corp, or even va covery? benefits in general?

**M:** Yeah, I think the way. So I played around on the va.gov. I think once all of the information is actually input there, I think it's a better process than what he benefits is. But the catch is to get all of the information in that location, it really is a lot easier.

**M:** Great, well, that is good feedback, because we like hearing that, because that's where we're moving it, we want to make sure that we're doing something right in the process. So

**M:** it's easy, it's a breakdown, everything, it's clear, and it uses great colors, like he benefits is kind of dreary, if that makes sense. Whereas va.gov, it's bright, you can see it, you know, it's easy on the eyes.

**M:** Okay, now, that actually matters because you, you want to make sure that it's legible and clear. And so the colors and the placement, so I appreciate you giving us that feedback, we would like to know we're going in the right direction on things. Okay. Well, I really appreciate you taking the time to talk to us about this. And we're going to write up summaries of your findings and the other people that we're talking to, and we're gonna work like crazy to make that new feature that new certificate of eligibility better. So awesome, awesome. I really appreciate it. So that is all I have. So I think we are finished at this point.

**M:** Okay, great. Thank you so much.
