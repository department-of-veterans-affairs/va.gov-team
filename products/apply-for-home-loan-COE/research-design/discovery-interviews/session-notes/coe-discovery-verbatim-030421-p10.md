I'm now recording. Do I have your permission to record this session?

**P10:**  0:04  
Yes, you do.

**P10:**  0:06  
Thanks. Appreciate that. Okay, so thank you so much for joining us. To start out if you could just tell us a little bit about yourself. You're in Japan. Yeah. That's crazy. You're on the other side of the world.

**P10:**  0:18  
Yes. Yes. Well, I'm a veteran, has served 15 years and then Navy as a Navy Corpsman. I spent seven and a half of them over here. The first time I was here in Japan from 1998 to 2005. And my wife I met someone married her my wife is a Navy nurse. Now I'm back here in Japan been here since 2018. But we're getting ready to return back to the states she is been selected for program doings corn school for clinical nurse specialists. And that which leads us to now I'm trying to use my VA loan, we're in the process of building a house in Buckeye, Arizona. Wow, going in, in between to San Diego, like her next duty station for school.

**P10:**  1:20  
Okay, you're, you're actually the first person that we've talked to who's in the process. So you're gonna have some really valuable insight for us. So I appreciate you getting on the bus. So to start up in, you mentioned that you're in the middle of building a house, so you know, the VA, it's like a, it's a little bit different process from somebody building or buying an existing home. Do you remember back to how you heard about VA loan benefits? How did you find out about them?

**P10:**  1:53  
Um, well, like I say, when I got out in 2006, I was doing all a process for my disability and everything in there, which is part of the the whatever, I forget what is taps class and things which are eligible for priority, you get it out of the Navy, the your outreach was called tap to just transition. Right? Something? It's been a long time but yes, they told us in our in our outbreak before we get out.

**P10:**  2:32  
Okay. Yeah, I know just what you're talking about there

**P10:**  2:34  
a lot of people that

**P10:**  2:38  
so you've applied for the loan, and you're guessing you're somewhere in the middle, you haven't actually closed but can you describe for us the steps that you've gone through in your process, just in big pieces with?

**P10:**  2:51  
Well, like they require information on both of us? Me, the veteran since my wife is still active duty here to provide documents disability, what my disability rating words, right. And then I they, they actually are able to retrieve the the loan themselves the gear certificate, your certificate of eligibility.

**P10:**  3:27  
Okay, so you're saying the lender got that for you?

**P10:**  3:31  
Yes. Okay. And then is females extremely lots of paperwork. We kind of just fell into the company that we're going with is Dr. Horton. Gilder and we're at this stage I forget what it's called for my wife this be my first time she's built the house, you know, so before they're starting to build I believe, right right now but due to the pandemic, but we're we're locked in with our contract lumber has has tripled the cost of the lumber now.

**P10:**  4:17  
That's crazy.

**P10:**  4:20  
But as far as the paperwork they send, I mean, it's, I can't it's so much paperwork that you you go through, right. And then yeah, but as far as what what is required like that to get they need your disability. Like all the stuff from the VA your dd 214. And basically, they start going from from there and determining a you know, for whether you have that tax break or not. Since you Cuz I'm 100% permanent and totally did say well, okay.

**P10:**  5:07  
Right, so you have to provide some documentation of that because it has a bearing on the loan.

**P10:**  5:12  
Okay. All right.

**P10:**  5:14  
So you're in the middle of the loan process. Is there anything that's going particularly? Well, you talk about a lot of paperwork? Are there any, anything?

**P10:**  5:25  
We were just kind of like, like I say, we're, we're just really starting is. To be honest, I haven't even gotten to a part where I actually apply for a loan, they do credit checks, okay. It's some, it's different, because we're doing basically, sort of like this virtual, and a lot of emails, because we can't physically be there. I am leaving before my wife trying to because we have a dog and flight restrictions. So I am trying to meet with the developers the agent in between going to San Diego. So okay, I'm in the process of trying to leave either the end of this month or April before gpcs is in July.

**P10:**  6:25  
Okay. Well, then we'll go ahead and talk a little bit about the CFP certificate of eligibility. So you mentioned that you had the lender, get that for you. Do you know what a certificate of eligibility? what it's for? Yes, I've

**P10:**  6:42  
I went in and requested it myself, just so I could. Okay. See you. And

**P10:**  6:50  
you see that you went in and requested. Did you go into? Like a VA office? On? No, I

**P10:**  6:57  
did it. I requested it on a benefits. Oh, I used to be a, I used to work for the VA. So I know about the benefits of va.gov. I work for the VA for like 15 years, until I came over overseas. You know what? My wife?

**P10:**  7:16  
So you knew just where to go? right away? Yes.

**P10:**  7:19  
Yes, yes.

**P10:**  7:21  
All right. So knowing what you did, it kind of gave you a leg up. But was there anything challenging about getting that CSV? Any problems? No, you just go. Go in there apply?

**P10:**  7:32  
It takes a couple of days, maybe three days tops. Okay. And then it's, and then you go back in? And is there into the benefits? Okay,

**P10:**  7:44  
so what you did was you you have to step through and fill out a form is that what you remember doing?

**P10:**  7:50  
Like, I applied online, right? Like, I already had the whatever premium account? I just went to let me see apply. Housing. And I did I clicked on a certificate of eligibility for for home loan. Okay. And I missed the but yeah, it was simple. And I take I put my information and then it, it says you've applied in, you know, wait a few days come back. Oh, no, not even that. I'm sorry. I just did. Once you click on it says, congratulations, your eligibility for home loan has been issued.

**P10:**  8:45  
So it sounds like you might have just logged in and received it automatically.

**P10:**  8:52  
Pretty Pretty. Well, I had to come back and then is there. Oh, maybe cuz I already did it. But if I click Upload request documents, it's right there. Gotcha.

**P10:**  9:06  
Okay. So you don't recall having any sort of difficulties, it was pretty easy. It was just way to learn.

**P10:**  9:12  
Yes. Like I said, went on to ee ee benefits, apply, you click on housing. And then you click on it, say certificate of eligibility. The first time you do it, it says you've applied just just come back and wait and then how can you do is right there.

**P10:**  9:34  
All right. Well, going thinking in terms of certificate of eligibility, do you know what the requirements are? siwi is what those requirements are.

**P10:**  9:44  
Um,

**P10:**  9:46  
I think you have to be, have at least a 20% disability rating. Okay, now don't quote me on but I'm not sure exactly. Because I think so because when I initially got out and back in 2006, I was eligible for so and I only had a 20% rating back then.

**P10:**  10:22  
Okay, I have a like a little detail question now that you've got your CSV. It mentioned something about fun funding fee status as an item. Do you know why this is important? I will see my E.

**P10:**  10:38  
Yes. It will. Like I say, when I do their credit check. They will. Such as I think you have to have at least 660 credit rating. Okay. And it goes into determining how much because I think the max you can receive is 600,000. Okay. And so, and my wife and I, our credit scores, three pretty good, but I think I have been approved. Right now up to 400 400,000.

**P10:**  11:34  
Where you might need it, unfortunately, timber is gonna triple in price.

**P10:**  11:38  
Well, we're locked into we get we're forced to we're locked into a contract. So good. We got what we have right now, as my wife has been checking our base price for five, five bedroom, three and a half bath. The base price was 308 309,000. I think 2626 59 square feet. Now the base price is like 350,000.

**P10:**  12:13  
It sounds going up on that. Yeah. Housing prices and materials. Yeah, it seems they only go one direction. Yeah, I said CLE. Did you have to provide any documentation? Do you remember having to upload anything or send?

**P10:**  12:29  
I did not. Okay, but because like I say, I've It's been a long time. I'm already you probably do. Right. But like I say you made DDT for cars that they want to verify your status. Okay. But like I say, I've been in the system for a long time now.

**P10:**  12:55  
Right. So and then provide your dd 214. But maybe somebody else might?

**P10:**  13:00  
Yes, they already have my information. Guess I'm sorry. It's like being vetted. I have a premium account, which is doesn't cost anything for the benefits because you automatically get it once you provide your information.

**P10:**  13:25  
Right. Okay. One last question on seaweed before we talk about some general stuff. Do you know any other way that you could get a certificate of eligibility? What other options you have for that?

**P10:**  13:38  
I mean, there are other avenues? I believe you could I mean, Okay, I'm gonna say he benefits if you're registered is the best way is simple. But the other avenues, you could go online and type it up and look at it and they'll say, I'm sure he benefits to come up if you have an account, but if you don't you someone you may have to pay someone or, or different, there's different, like I say avenues where websites or they may give you an address to write to to receive it, because initially, it's kind of hazy, but in 2006 actually, before I even get a take I had to write prior to me getting out. I think I I wrote in an A it was mailed to me.

**P10:**  14:39  
Okay, right. So maybe you filled out a paper form and sent it off and that stands

**P10:**  14:45  
Yes. Okay. Maybe I did. You know, they provided me when I was in the military, and how to retrieve it. And then when I got to the address where I was going, it was it was mailed to me. I mean, that in my name and thing was felt wrong. But then, but yes. I had a certificate that was that was mailed to me.

**P10:**  15:11  
All right? Well, we're gonna move on and talk a little bit about just VA websites, and you have some experience with them. Do you? Can you recall any particularly good or bad experiences?

**P10:**  15:24  
Um,

**P10:**  15:26  
well, there's only two that they coincide together, I use a benefits in va dot.gov. I don't understand why they have to, but you still kind of need to use both of them. But rank, they should just really merge in tissues. va.gov, in my opinion, but they still have you using both of them.

**P10:**  15:52  
Yeah, you're exactly right about that. The team that I'm working with is moving features from me benefits over to va.gov. So eventually, yeah, it'll all be there. So you're absolutely right about that. So have you had any particularly good experiences? Is there anything that you can tell us about that you like, or the reverse? Also, you know, some things

**P10:**  16:15  
I like? Like I say, he benefits. It's kind of like the dinosaur one now. But va.gov. I really like and once you Well, for me when I log into EAD benefits, and then I bring va.gov, it automatically starts to load up because I guess I'm logged into the other one. But it doesn't work. Vice versa. If you use login to va.gov, then you have to log into your benefits as well.

**P10:**  16:48  
Okay, you say that you like va.gov? What in particular do you like about it?

**P10:**  16:56  
Oh, I'm sorry, the I like, because the I'm current I currently have appeals going on. And I check that pretty frequently. And it gives me the update status before I get my notification in the mail, I can constantly check and see what has been done. Where is that? The status of my claims? Gotcha.

**P10:**  17:28  
So Claim Status, and it sounded like maybe you were talking about prescription status, you'd like that about you?

**P10:**  17:36  
I'm sorry. What was that?

**P10:**  17:38  
Were you mentioning something about Claim Status on va.gov? You'd like that part? Yes. Scan that you were talking about prescriptions to?

**P10:**  17:48  
Um, no, not prescription. But now, when I was back in the States, yes. If you go aside, here's another one. But they're all interchangeable. I get my health event that I used to go in, make my appointments through my health event, using the portal, it made it very easy to do my prescriptions, talk with my provider. Make my appointments. Okay. Um, more. As I turned 50, this month, I'm still a gadget person, I use a utilize the technology does this before me.

**P10:**  18:34  
Right, gotcha. So you just sort of take what's available? Yeah. And I yeah, I thought you were talking about something else. So

**P10:**  18:42  
Oh, no, but I've rarely and now due to the pandemic we're going, I've rarely, like a walk up to unless I was working at the VA, then I go, but I utilize the various websites to talk to with my team provider team and make

**P10:**  19:06  
my my appointments. Okay. So you know, all the websites and what they're for is that we're at, we're at time. Now, would you mind if we if we talk just a little bit longer. I've got a couple of more questions here.

**P10:**  19:22  
Sure. Great,

**P10:**  19:23  
I really appreciate that. We want to respect your time so I don't want to go too crazy with it. But there were a couple of things I just wanted to get your perspective on. So you're in the middle of the building home and in the home buying process. Are there any questions that you had when you started this process that you wish that we may have given you answers for

**P10:**  19:47  
I'm now I've rely honestly heavily on my on my wife because she's well not through this process. says, but she knows what it you know, what to look for the question says, okay, you know, in regards to the house are, you know, building a house because she's owned a couple of houses and sold and things of that nature. Now the only thing that she's really because she's the active duty one right now that she really need for me is what the requirements that they have, as far and, you know, given me the veteran status for for the loan and not having to pay the taxes and, okay, I forget what it's called the fee or whatever all of that's weight.

**P10:**  20:51  
Right? Because of your disability rating. Correct. Okay, so basically, she's handling it, and you don't have any questions, because you're relying on her to go through the process. And she's using

**P10:**  21:05  
Yes, now I am. But I do, like chime in with the, the builders and Asians, like I'm I see all the information. And we talk about it in that process. Gotcha. Gotcha.

**P10:**  21:23  
So you're aware of the process and how it's going. And then yes,

**P10:**  21:26  
like, I'm involved, but as far as she knows, what like to look for, like, what should be done? Right? They should be doing this this as far as the statue and the contract and things before we finalize everything. Gotcha.

**P10:**  21:47  
Okay.

**P10:**  21:50  
One more question about certificate of eligibility, it seems like it was pretty simple. Is there anything we could do to make that process easier or simpler?

**P10:**  21:59  
For me, like I say, he was just clicking a button.

**P10:**  22:04  
Right? That's pretty easy. Yeah. And it's Yeah, it's not that easy for everybody. So we just want to make sure if there's something we could share,

**P10:**  22:11  
you have to have, in my opinion, either you have to know how to navigate the web browsers and things of that nature, which are which you're looking for, or have someone that has can help you if you're right. Like I say, I'm not I can navigate my computer. Um, even though I was like, I was having trouble this morning. I just did not click that button there. But I worked in the hour, I did work, I worked in the IT field, and I'm a health system specialist. So But like I say, it's, it's easy if you know how to, to navigate the websites or in feet know exactly what you're looking for. Okay.

**P10:**  23:07  
Well, I have one more question about the loan process, and you're in the middle of it. But if somebody were to come to you and look for some advice, like a What can you tell me about getting a VA loan? certificate of eligibility or the process in general? What sort of advice would you give that person? What would you tell them? Well,

**P10:**  23:27  
there is there are places you can go. Take a Dave Feldman mentioned that we are on a on Facebook called VA vet it? Oh, there, there's there's a program on our website, a group, a chat group, that a veteran has videos and things and in the process and how it works. And if you have questions, this is your first time how to build your credit. Because that that plays that will play a factor in your in your, your mouth, actually a big part because they would take several credit checks on you. Okay. So,

**P10:**  24:19  
so you benefited from this.

**P10:**  24:22  
Look, VA vetted. You right, and you would tell

**P10:**  24:25  
you tell somebody else to take a look at that, and that would help them?

**P10:**  24:29  
Yes, absolutely.

**P10:**  24:30  
Well, that's good advice right there. Yeah. It's always good to have answers at a time. And yeah, people that have done it before and people that know how to do it. Those are the people you lean on. So in your case, you're wiped out through the process, but that's a good resource that you just pointed out. Okay, well, that's pretty much everything that I've got on my list. We've run a little bit over time. Is there anything else that you would like for us to know about? Va websites, benefits home, the this CSV processor home loan process.

**P10:**  25:04  
Now, like I say I had learned about, you know, the process that like, prior to me getting out of the military. And it was just a matter of me going on to eat benefits and and request them for right. And back to eat benefits. There's not an I'm looking at you can request how you want to fit I had mine sent to me through through email. Okay.

**P10:**  25:42  
So you're talking about receiving your your co e you got it that way through email?

**P10:**  25:46  
Yes.

**P10:**  25:47  
Do you remember what the other options were? Was it like, mail? Or?

**P10:**  25:52  
Um, yes, yes, you can be mailed to you also. Oh, great. All right. Well,

**P10:**  25:58  
I appreciate you getting up really, really early in the morning to talk to us. Yeah. And I appreciate your feedback and your insight, it's going to help us make things better. So that's pretty much all I've got. So at this point, I think we'll just say goodbye, and thank you.

**P10:**  26:16  
All right. You're welcome. And thank you. And best of luck on that home.

**P10:**  26:21  
I hope they get it built pretty quick. And I hope it's your dream home.

**P10:**  26:25  
Yes, it's supposed to be done finish by October, which would kind of be perfect. Like I say, we're actually headed to San Diego, right. Next, for as far as my wife will go to school for two for two years. But I will be commuting back between San Diego and Buckeye things because it's only like a six hour drive and our flight. So yes.

**P10:**  26:59  
That's still that's that's that is a commute that's actually commute. Yeah. Well, best of luck with that and thank you again.

**P10:**  27:08  
But thank you. Alright, bye bye. Bye bye.
