**P7:**  0:01  
All right. Do I have your permission to record this session?

**P7:**  0:04  
Yes, absolutely.

**P7:**  0:05  
Great. Thank

**P7:**  0:05  
you. All right. To start out with, could you tell us a little bit about yourself, maybe starting with your service history, and then maybe on to any general experiences with VA VA benefits?

**P7:**  0:21  
Well, my name is Rachel, and I was a reservist for I did my eight years. And I actually just got out December. But my husband was active duty, and he is a retired disabled veteran, and he was active duty his entire career. So he actually when we, right after we got married, after college, he commissioned, and I followed him around for a while. And then when it looked like he was going to be getting out because he was going to be medically discharged, I couldn't give up the military. So that's when I commissioned and then I joined the reserves for eight years, while he was on his tail end. So that's kind of our background in history. So we're a military family. We've moved around. I think we had like four primary duty stations, excluding deployments and things like that in schools and whatnot. So enough to give you a taste.

**P7:**  1:14  
Yeah, that sounds really good. We've only had a couple of people who were reservists. Quite a few. They're veterans. So you're gonna have some interesting perspectives for some Sure. So you have applied for a VA backed loan, or an ADL loan in the past? Yes,

**P7:**  1:31  
yes.

**P7:**  1:33  
So how did you find out about VA loan benefits.

**P7:**  1:37  
So before I joined the reserves back at our first duty station in Germany, I was a counselor, army colonel on my program, and I actually gave the veterans briefing, the mandatory briefing soldiers have to get when are getting out to learn about their VA benefits. So I was pretty well versed in what was available. And I knew it. And then my husband also knew it because his sister and her husband were also in the military, and they got their first home loan through the VA. And so he learned about it. So we just basically have always known about the Home Loan Guarantee.

**P7:**  2:14  
It sounds like you might actually be an expert in it, too. If you had.

**P7:**  2:18  
No, I'm definitely not. It was too long ago. I've, I've had kids since then they erase your memory.

**P7:**  2:25  
I think I had that happen to me. Yeah. how that goes.

**P7:**  2:29  
Okay.

**P7:**  2:30  
Can you tell us a little bit then, in your your experience with getting a VA loan, what the steps were?

**P7:**  2:36  
Actually it was super, super easy. So we moved here, and we knew that we wanted to stay here. So um, and we went house shopping, that kind of thing. But we decided that we wanted to buy the house that we were currently renting. And we had already contacted a real estate agent who had been showing us around, she showed us a few different houses. But we decided we just want to put an offer on the house that we were renting. We didn't even know if it was for sale or not put in an offer. It got accepted. And I don't remember if she's the one that said you need to go find a lender. Or if she she probably recommended someone but we didn't take her recommendation. So my coworker had a VA home loan, and he said, hey, my guy was awesome, wants to use him. So we contacted him and said, Do you still do VA Home Loans? That's that's what we want to get? And he said, Yeah, absolutely. So he pretty much did everything for us. He told us what documents we needed for the VA eligibility what I mean, we just assumed we were eligible. I mean, we have an excellent credit score. Our house was well within our means. Both good paying jobs, that type of thing. So I mean, to us, I mean, it was gonna be a no brainer that we'd be eligible but he the lender said, This is what I need from you guys. We submitted to him and he did everything. So it was super easy.

**P7:**  4:05  
That sounds good. We've heard that a couple of times where there's a lender or sometimes even a real estate agent with VA experience and they help guide people through the process. Would you say that this person was the biggest help in going through the process? Can you think of anything else that was particularly easy or or surprisingly good as you went through

**P7:**  4:24  
it? Well, it was surprisingly good. So so we got accepted and everything like that. So during the process after we put in our what we were willing to pay for the house, it got accepted and then during the part of the process, you have to have a VA home loan inspection for the loan to go through. And it our house got appraised at like 7000 less than what our offer was for. We didn't we put $7,000 on the table so it was up to the seller if he was willing to come down or not. So he ended up taking it because he had already entered a new contract. Where he was to he really needed this to go through. So we got our house $7,000 less than we were willing to pay for it. So that was pretty awesome.

**P7:**  5:07  
That is kind of cool.

**P7:**  5:09  
Yeah, yeah, we've

**P7:**  5:10  
talked to a couple of people about the VA inspections. So that was a surprise in your favor. Were there any problems or stumbling blocks that popped up in the course of this that you remember? And how, how did you get past those,

**P7:**  5:26  
though, the only thing I remember, like during their inspection, some of the things that they nitpick about was like, you know, there was a chip on a doorframe, and that the doorframe had to get repainted, you know, some some minor things like that, that just were slightly annoying, but I don't remember, it went really quickly. The whole process, you know, took probably less than a month, it was amazing. Now, right now we're in refinancing. And it's taking forever, because I guess they're backed up so bad. Um, it was very, very painless. So it was it was a really good process, I would highly recommend it to everyone.

**P7:**  6:03  
Well, a month sounds like, that's a really tight timeframe. And I'm glad everything went well. Sounds good. And

**P7:**  6:10  
we weren't on a timeframe. You know, we were living in a house just paying rent, but it just went so smooth. It just went. I mean, it was it was Yeah, it

**P7:**  6:18  
was amazing. Sounds like the stars alone. He did. I'm glad you have no no problems. So that kind of takes two or three questions off my list here. So going to the going back to like the general home buying process, and the steps that you had to take, were there any tools that you had to use or anything that you had to go to whether it was a website, or whether it was something in the real world that was especially helpful, or made the process go better? Any references or calculators, something that you just ran across? You're like, Oh, that's cool. Let's use that.

**P7:**  7:03  
As well, I would assume that knowing myself, I mean, this. This was nine and a half years ago. But um, knowing myself, I probably went and filled out like your mortgage calculator, you know, like, if we bought the house, what would our our payment be that kind of thing during the process? I mean, I can't say with certainty in which one it was, because I know there's several out there. But that that type of thing. That's always you know, you want to know what, what's this going to write? I mean, it's the same thing with refinancing your house, it's like, Okay, if we can knock off some percentage points and pay it off in 15 years instead of 30. How much more a month, will that cost us? I mean, it's always about, can we afford to do this? So it's just like getting a car, you got to know that if you're going to take out a car loan that you can afford your payments, and that you can still have fun on the side. Okay,

**P7:**  7:55  
well, yeah, 910 years ago, I wouldn't expect you to remember all the details, but it sounds like you'd find a tool like that. pretty helpful.

**P7:**  8:04  
Yeah, I love calculators.

**P7:**  8:09  
All right, we're gonna go ahead and move on to the certificate of eligibility part. Okay, so you went through the process? And at some point, see a we came up? Can you tell us what a certificate of eligibility is?

**P7:**  8:24  
You know, our lender did it for us, but I'm pretty sure you had to have it in your paperwork, just to let the financial institution know that the BA that you're eligible, and that the VA will back you up.

**P7:**  8:39  
Okay, so that was one of the things that the lender may have done directly.

**P7:**  8:45  
He did he did everything for us. He would tell us like okay, we need your you know, two copies of your last two months le s we need your your military ID bank statements that kind of thing for for the application, but he did everything for us.

**P7:**  9:01  
Okay, that sounds good. So you don't recall any specifics? It sounds like the process was was really easy. In fact, maybe even invisible sounds like right?

**P7:**  9:11  
Yeah, it was it was pretty seamless. Okay. It was almost like just another sheet you fill out you know, when you're applying for a huge loan, you know, you fill out so many papers and you initial so many spots and fill out your you know, sign your name and so many different spots that it was just another paper you filled out and you just paper you signed?

**P7:**  9:31  
Yeah, that makes sense. When you get the stack if there's just like one or two sheets thrown in there for CME or other things. It's not gonna, it's definitely not going to stand out. Now, just you talked a little bit about what you thought a certificate of eligibility is Do you know anything about cod requirements? Do you know what those

**P7:**  9:53  
Yes, well, because you have to meet like the servants requirement. So you have to have been on active duty Certain, you know, number of months, or you know, during wartime that kind of thing, just just like education benefits, you have to meet them, and then also like to get a home loan, you have to want to live in that house, you can't just get a home loan to go rent it out, you actually are going to have to reside in that house.

**P7:**  10:18  
Okay.

**P7:**  10:20  
Okay, that sounds good. I'm sure I'm sure there's also, it'd be crazy for the VA to you know, give, give a home loan to someone who has, you know, horrible credit, they have all this debt, that type of thing. So I'm sure there's, you know, like, you have to have a certain income for that house that you're going to buy things like that. So all the box would have to get checked.

**P7:**  10:40  
Do you recall any other VA paperwork? I mean, the CSV was invisible, transparent, and it was somewhere in the process. But do you remember anything else coming from the VA that had to do with it?

**P7:**  10:52  
I don't know if it was the, the eligibility or if if it was separate, or if it was the same thing, but there was an actual VA home loan application? And I don't know if that is before the same thing, or if it's a different piece of paper, but there was an actual application as well.

**P7:**  11:10  
Right. Okay. So you do you remember something with the VA logo on it that had to do with the home loan? Not necessarily see away, but there was something that you recall?

**P7:**  11:19  
Yeah. Only because I went back and I knew about that this was coming up. So I was like, so long ago, I don't remember anything. So we still have all the emails. So I went back and re read them. So I yeah, it jogged my memory.

**P7:**  11:33  
That's pretty amazing. I really appreciate you doing that. It's definitely qualifies as above and beyond the call of duty. Most people we just go off your your recollections, because your impressions of things are sometimes is, you know, just as good as anything else is some of the details. Having said that, though, I do have a question about details. Okay. Do you recall seeing anything in your CV or your maybe in your VA paperwork about funding fee or funding fee status?

**P7:**  12:03  
No, okay. No, I don't I don't remember that at all. I hope it was low, whatever it was.

**P7:**  12:11  
If it was your way through, if everything went through without a hitch, chances are everything was, you know, pretty good. unremarked. Okay. That's the way you want to hold on to go through, you don't want anything to stand out. Right. Okay. Well, I'm just hearing funding thing status. Do you have any idea why it might be important for a VA loan? Does it ring a bell at all?

**P7:**  12:33  
Can you repeat the question?

**P7:**  12:35  
I'm just hearing the term funding fee or funding fee status? Do you know why that might be important? If you were to guess?

**P7:**  12:50  
No, not really. What? Because I'm curious, when I hear that? Is that money coming from me? Or is that money coming from the VA to back the loan? I'm confused to where am I having to pay that money? Or is it the VA back in the loan? So your loan can go through?

**P7:**  13:07  
Gotcha. It is kind of it does have to do with the amount of money that you might pay? Or some portion? And I'm not, there are people on the call that will answer this better than I would I'm just going to give it a shot. But it's a it's a certain amount of money that you you're responsible for paying for it over the course of getting the home loan through. So that's as much as I know, specifically, and because the observers have pretty much agreed to be silent. They're probably sitting here banging on the keyboard going No, that's not it sounds vaguely if it's something like that.

**P7:**  13:45  
So I just had a curiosity. Do you guys get like flack for that, like, soldiers members don't think they should have to pay me?

**P7:**  13:55  
Um, personally, I don't know. There are people that are that I work with that are part of the business. And they're from the line of business. They're from VBA. And because I'm over on the other side with va.gov. I'm working to implement their tools, but I'm not a subject matter expert. Okay, I

**P7:**  14:13  
see. Sometimes

**P7:**  14:14  
Sometimes I hear anecdotally, you know, how things go, but I don't have any first hand knowledge. Okay, I get it. But I would imagine that you probably want to get by paying as little as possible. So you push back if somebody were to see a fee, but I think this is important, because in the interest of full disclosure, now this funding fee and money be status, you want somebody who's applying for the loan to know what they might be responsible for. Yeah, I think that's one of the reasons for the question in there. But, you know, when when we talk in a debrief, I'm sure they'll let me know specifically. So well,

**P7:**  14:54  
in my opinion, I mean, the VA home loan has such a good reputation. It's such Good loan, that you would be crazy to have something that stop you. Like, it's like, Just shut up and pay that because you're getting the best deal that you're gonna get.

**P7:**  15:10  
I think in all the people that we have talked to you, and I believe you're probably the eighth, or maybe the ninth person that we've talked to on this, it's it's gone pretty much like you said, it's been very smooth, very few bumps, there's almost always somebody to lend a hand and manage the process for you. And it's always been a good deal. So I think you're spot on with that it's probably the best deal out there. I can't imagine somebody who has this as an option walking away from an idea. It's just, you know, no doubt, it's kind of a crazy thing.

**P7:**  15:42  
Yep.

**P7:**  15:43  
Certainly that. So getting back to the certificate of eligibility. And because you don't remember that specifically, we'll just generalize that to the loan process. You had mentioned that there were a couple of documents that you had to provide military ID. What was the LTS? Do you recall any other documentation that you needed to provide for the home loan process?

**P7:**  16:11  
bank statements like to two months of bank statements? social security card, I believe,

**P7:**  16:18  
okay.

**P7:**  16:19  
And maybe maybe it was other forms of identity, like a certain number, forms of identification, not just the military ID, but there had to be something else the LCS

**P7:**  16:30  
right? Do you recall if these were VA specific requirements, or if they were just part of the home loan process?

**P7:**  16:38  
I think they were VA, but I'm not 100% on that. That's fine. That is

**P7:**  16:43  
fine. So going back and talking about that certificate of eligibility, you say you just sort of went through and you have no problems getting it? If you were to try to direct somebody to find a CSV or to fill it out, please, one submit one. Do you know what options there are for getting a CLS?

**P7:**  17:06  
Well, the one I definitely know of, you can go to va.gov. And there's a link there that you can click on to either start it or see it or that type of thing. But also, um, I think I'm a huge Google person. So I would imagine if you googled it, you'd probably get different options. And it'd be different even lending companies out there that want you to go through them that probably have links as well.

**P7:**  17:32  
Okay. Those are a couple of really popular options right there. And you worked directly with a lender and the lender knew the process. So with that's another thing that we've heard from time to time. Okay. So one of the questions I had to, you know, to do with the CSV is, you know, would you do anything different now in the process, but, and that, I mean, it was pretty much invisible to you. So, you had mentioned that, in this day and age, you might Google it. So yeah, yeah. Is that? Can you think of any other way that you might go out and try to find information on a CSV or any other resources that you'd go to?

**P7:**  18:13  
coworkers? I mean, I'd ask them as well. I like personal experiences from people I like and trust. So I would discuss with you know, like, oh, who would you? I mean, just like refinancing right now, it was all? Oh, who do you go through? Who do you like that type of thing. So, um, yeah, word of mouth through like co workers and things like that. Um, okay. I know, like, back in the day, when I actually gave the briefing. There's, you know, phone numbers of people that you can call and talk to directly. And I'm sure there, there's numbers on the VA website as well talk to someone to get information. But, uh, I, you know, and I know, I'm not alone here, but Google's huge, you know, if you can look it up online? Well, actually, I think everyone should look it up online. There's people that you know, go to Facebook and act all helpless. It's like, you have Google to go look up yourself. But, uh, no, I, I usually pretty much use Google for about everything.

**P7:**  19:14  
Okay, I appreciate that insight. That's a that's actually a pretty good list. The last section, the last group of things we're going to talk about have to do with just VA websites in general. And so you mentioned va.gov, that website and other websites, have you had any particularly good experiences with them. And then on the reverse side, have, you know, you've had any bad experiences with VA websites,

**P7:**  19:39  
what? I have not had any bad, I wouldn't say I've had any bad experiences and good I like va.gov is just really straightforward. Like it's super easy to find what you want and where you need to go and having the links work and stuff like that. So I think it's a really good it's really good website. And I don't think I've really I know other ones pop up like veterans united. There's some other veteran organizations. So the funny thing is, if you google something about the VA, a lot of times va.gov is like the fifth or sixth one down, you have all these other ones. And that, to me, kind of is surprising. Like, I think va.gov should be the top one. And I don't know why it's not.

**P7:**  20:27  
There are a lot of reasons why, um, but

**P7:**  20:31  
I want to pay money, probably.

**P7:**  20:33  
That's part of it. Definitely part of it right there, we are actually doing some things to try to elevate our location in search, so that we're considered the de facto, or the definitive source for that information so that the paid ads go below. So there's an initiative out there to try to manage the site a little bit better. So that happens. So it sounds like you You like the information you like being the way that you can navigate around it. Have you had any bad experiences with VA websites? That you can think of that? No,

**P7:**  21:05  
I haven't personally,

**P7:**  21:06  
there are other aside from va.gov. What other VA websites? Do you remember using?

**P7:**  21:15  
I can't say Oh, sure. I have. Back in the day, when I had a kayo. There was all sorts of links and on like really boring drill. I would pretty much click on all of them. So I'm sure in time, I've been on others, but I can't recall.

**P7:**  21:33  
Okay, that's fine. How do you feel about going to be a website's for some or part of that online process?

**P7:**  21:42  
Oh, you know, these days, you kind of assume your whole process is going to be online, so it doesn't bother me at all. Okay, I would rather go to a website than have to call a person.

**P7:**  21:53  
We've we hear that a lot. There are a bunch of hotline numbers. But you know, there's so many people that use those hotlines, it's sometimes you got to get the queue. And that is my dog. That's awesome. We'll see if that time of day and the kids are home. So yeah, the roaming in and banging through the cupboards looking for stuff. So these just let me know they're here. So going back to the website, what could we provide you online that would make a home buying or home loan experience better? Any sort of tools or information come to mind?

**P7:**  22:31  
Maybe if you could search and I don't maybe this is their I don't know, search for your zip code, and then have a list pop up of like lenders in that zip code or zip code area that are qualified and know about the VA home loan process? That would be huge.

**P7:**  22:53  
That sounds good. I think we've heard that before. I don't believe that there is a tool like that. But that is something that these sorts of things. We're kind of in the part of the program, we're trying to hit that wish list and find out what's around us that people would find helpful. And that is one we've heard before. So that's good. So looking back at the the process that you went through for the home loan, fast as it was, I know that it was 10 years ago. Were there any questions that you wish you had the answers to before you started? Any information you wish you had available?

**P7:**  23:30  
No, I don't think so. Okay. I mean, maybe maybe there, there was, but I mean, we were pretty naive just because it was our first house. We just didn't know any better. So whatever you told us, okay.

**P7:**  23:45  
Well, you had a couple things going for you had like a super fast textbook experience from start to finish. This is pretty amazing. And then it sounds like you had somebody who's who have been there. So that's that sounds. Okay. So this is another one of those questions that if you had a perfect experience, it's it's hard to imagine it being any different. But is there anything you change about the home buying experience, in particular, where the VA Home Loans come into the picture? Anything we could do different or anything that could change about that process?

**P7:**  24:22  
No, I think the VA, the VA is fine. I can speak like we've had friends that have tried to buy loans, and your bank or lender is huge, huge shoes, and some of them are just horrible. So I don't know if there's a way that the VA could say, yeah, it's not best to go with them, because it's gonna take forever. These are the ones we recommend. But I don't know if you guys could even do that. Probably not.

**P7:**  24:48  
Maybe not, but that's the sort of thing that, you know, we'll go ahead and throw it in the findings and see if there is something that we could do, but it sounds a little on the order of like the certification. An er VA recommendation.

**P7:**  25:02  
Yeah,

**P7:**  25:03  
there are professionals who are received some sort of certification from VA. I'm not sure lenders are part of it, but we'll do some investigation on that and see if we can do it. That does sound like something that would make things better. And again, we've heard other people in the past, say, you know, we want to go with a lender you can trust, so it'd be good to get some seal of approval. Yeah. Okay. All right. Um, the last question that I have about loans is, you know, going through the process, if somebody were to come to you and say, Hey, you just bought a house, you know, word of mouth again? What advice would you have for that person in going out and getting a VA loan? And if they were to ask certificate of eligibility?

**P7:**  25:47  
What what exactly is their question?

**P7:**  25:51  
If they said, Hey, I'm going through, can you give me some advice? What What should I look out for? What should I do? What should my first steps be? Just the sort of things that you might have wanted to know what if

**P7:**  26:04  
they're on a if they're on a tight timeline, make sure you just start getting all your documents together. So you don't have to like, especially if you're working full time, and you get that email, okay, this is this is what I need, you can get a list ahead of time of all the documentation you're going to need, and things like that. So you can have it all ready to go. So when I asked for it, boom, there it is.

**P7:**  26:23  
Okay, that sounds good. So that's pretty much I've got what I've got on the list here. And it looks like we're pretty close to 30 minutes. So is there anything else that you would like for us to know about va.gov VA benefits? Anything else? We could?

**P7:**  26:42  
No, but I'd like to thank you for the VA home loan guarantee. Amazing program.

**P7:**  26:47  
There are people on line right now that are probably just doing a happy dance. They're very happy to hear that sort of thing.

**P7:**  26:53  
Yeah, I think I mean, next, educational benefits are really good too, because that that changes your entire course of your life as well. But next to educational benefits. The best thing the VA does is the home loan. guarantee.

**P7:**  27:08  
That's really good to hear. Yeah, that's great to hear. Well, thank you once again for giving up your little piece of your Friday evening to sit down and give us your thoughts. I appreciate it. And I believe that is it for our study. So

**P7:**  27:21  
thank you great weekend.

**P7:**  27:23  
All right, you too. Bye bye.

**P7:**  27:24  
Thank you. Bye.
