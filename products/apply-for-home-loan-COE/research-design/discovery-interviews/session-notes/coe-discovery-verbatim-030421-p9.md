Okay,

**P9:**  0:01  
do I have your permission to record this session?

**P9:**  0:04  
Yes. Thank you. Okay.

**P9:**  0:07  
We'll start out if you would just tell us a little bit about yourself, and maybe give us some idea of your background service history.

**P9:**  0:15  
Okay, I retired from the Air Force after 20 years. And I got my VA loan back in 2010. is what I purchased my home. Okay, and I was Munitions for that whole time. Okay.

**P9:**  0:35  
So you do you have a VA loan? And so yeah, the first part of what we want to find out is how did that go? The step by step the process? Do you remember? Can you outline for us how that went?

**P9:**  0:49  
Okay. Oh, goodness. So yeah, I know. It was actually pretty simple. Because once I got the certificate of eligibility, which we're gonna talk about later, but that was a simple process, as a matter of just going in there. It took a minute to figure out where it was that but I was able to figure out where it was that and then once that part happened, and everything else was like smooth sailing from there.

**P9:**  1:16  
Well, that's good. So the VA, part of the whole experience went pretty well, after you figured out, you know, the thing about Cod, what about the rest of the buying process? And how the VA figured into that? So,

**P9:**  1:28  
okay. So the rest of my buying process, because I was dealing with a realtor that dealt with VA loans, right. They were very proficient educated on how that part went. So for me as just a veteran, it was smooth. I didn't have any issues. I have no hiccups. I have nothing. Good. They did most of the dealing with the VA site.

**P9:**  1:55  
Okay. So with that in mind, who were what would you say was the biggest helping getting you through this process?

**P9:**  2:02  
My realtor having the education of dealing with veterans?

**P9:**  2:06  
Okay. Yeah, we've heard that quite a bit to occasionally somebodies mentioned that they've dealt with somebody who wasn't familiar. But by and large, we've dealt with, we've heard from people that that's been a big help to have a realtor and a lender. Okay. So in terms of the, it sounds like you've everything went very well and smooth. Was there anything that was just surprisingly simple or good? So what went well in applying for this long,

**P9:**  2:36  
but the whole process was just the so as far as like downpayment, like stuff that you would normally do, if you weren't a veteran, and you weren't going to be using a VA loan. That part was actually pretty interesting, because I didn't have all the down payments and all the extra because I was using a veteran as well.

**P9:**  2:55  
Okay. So because you were going through VA, and you were backed by VA, you didn't have to go through that part.

**P9:**  3:02  
Yes. And being a first time homebuyer that was very, very helpful.

**P9:**  3:09  
Right. Yeah. It's kind of hard to know what you're in for when you've done it your first time, I'm sure. Yes. Everything seemed to have gone really well. But were there any sort of speed bumps or problems that popped up? You mentioned a little bit? Let's see, we are finding that was an issue. What was the biggest?

**P9:**  3:30  
Yeah, just knowing where to go? Because granted, the the realtor knew the VA side as far as the financial part, what they didn't know the website part for getting that certificate of eligibility.

**P9:**  3:46  
Okay. So that was the biggest thing. How did you finally get past that

**P9:**  3:52  
problem? talking to other veterans that had previously purchased homes? Okay.

**P9:**  4:01  
Well, that's that's one of the other things we've heard a lot of times it's word of mouth.

**P9:**  4:05  
Yeah. Yeah. So what I've noticed with dealing with just being a veteran dealing with VA benefits, is there's no pamphlet like you learn from other people who have been through the same situation. And I think for me, that's the negative is that there is no like User's Manual.

**P9:**  4:29  
Right. Right for and part of what we are trying to do is put some information, make it more available, but I do understand what you're saying. There's there's no super simple process to go through for a lot of this stuff. So we'll talk a little bit about that too, and what we can do to help there. Were there any other problems that you ran into in in the whole loan process outside of just finding out and getting to that? Do we

**P9:**  4:57  
know Okay,

**P9:**  5:00  
All right. So with that, we'll go ahead and scoot on to the certificate of eligibility. So you mentioned finding it was kind of a problem. And in talking to other veterans and other people who've gone through the process, they said, you know, go here and find it. Can you tell us a little bit about what, you know, that certificate out? easy for me to say? Could you tell us what a certificate of eligibility is?

**P9:**  5:29  
is just showing your military service? So is verifying that you're eligible to even have or apply for a veteran's loan?

**P9:**  5:36  
Okay. And you got yours online? Is that what I

**P9:**  5:41  
guess?

**P9:**  5:41  
Okay. Can you describe that process for us a little bit?

**P9:**  5:46  
Because I think it was through he benefits. Okay. Because I think I think that's pretty sure is where I went, right? To get that form. And then once you've added a benefit, then it had a drop down for your documents.

**P9:**  6:04  
Okay, all right.

**P9:**  6:05  
I believe that's where I went. And then in that listing, is the eligibility letter.

**P9:**  6:12  
Okay.

**P9:**  6:13  
So username matter request.

**P9:**  6:16  
Okay. So, when you went to a benefits, you'd said that you went and got the form? Did you get a form and then fill out the form like once a paper form or PDF? Or did you go through the form on the site? You remember that?

**P9:**  6:32  
I did it on the online. Okay, when my document was printed out, it was fully filled out.

**P9:**  6:40  
Okay. Yeah, that is exactly the feature that we are going to be migrating over. So, and that's pretty good memory for 10 years ago, um, whatever. It is even talking about that drop down, which I am pretty familiar with. It's it's a little Beasley Alright. Okay. Now, do you recall whether filling out the form itself was easy or difficult? You said there's a drop down, you just went to eligibility letter and that you had it automatically generated? So you got your CSV that way? Was it See?

**P9:**  7:17  
I think it was easy, because I think it went off my information that was like in the system already, from when I retired.

**P9:**  7:25  
Okay.

**P9:**  7:26  
I think it was like a pre populate, almost. Okay.

**P9:**  7:31  
Yeah, that is part of the feature. That is, so for, okay. Yeah, for some people, they don't have to fill out much or anything. So it sounds like you're one of the people that got in and had enough information system that he was able to return you will see away. Okay, so that that is definitely the happy path. Were there any difficulties around getting to the CSV outside of you know, going to the benefits, but just thinking about the screen, the interface and what you have to do? If there are any problems?

**P9:**  7:59  
No, because that is one of the pluses is ease benefits, once you figure out that the website you need is very easy to navigate. Okay.

**P9:**  8:08  
All right. Well, the next question I have is then CSV requirements, you said that you got your CSV based on the information, they had the system, and you got it automatically. Do you know what the requirements for a certificate of eligibility is?

**P9:**  8:20  
Our

**P9:**  8:21  
I just know you have to be a veteran. I don't know like what the timeframe is.

**P9:**  8:27  
Okay. So you don't recall any other specifics like character of service or educational load? Those sorts of things. So I

**P9:**  8:39  
think you have to be honorably discharged. I don't think if you have a dishonorable, but I'm not showing the timeframe, because I think for me, I didn't really pay attention to that stuff, because I did 20 years and retire early. So I didn't even I wasn't trying to like, let me see if I meet the qualifications. I knew I met the qualifications. And you got this. I didn't really pay attention.

**P9:**  9:04  
Okay, already. Then I got the the CSV, it was generated automatically. Do you? Do you recall anything on your CV about funding fee status? Do you know what that is? It's a data. Okay. Yeah. It's just something in the list that we're just trying to find out about. See if there's an awareness around it. So you got to see a we automatically, so you didn't have to really provide any documentation? Is that correct? Oh, okay. That's correct. All right. Yeah, you did. You went through the happiest of happy dance, that's for sure. So you went to eat benefits to get your care and you talk to other people and they said, Go there. That's what you do. Or are you aware or were you aware of any other options for getting a co op? Do you know any other ways you can do that? No. Okay, so the benefits was your one and only choice and you went straight there?

**P9:**  10:06  
Yes. Okay.

**P9:**  10:10  
So knowing what you do now about CSV and where it was sounds like it was pretty straightforward. It was just the finding part. But is there anything that we could do differently about certificate of eligibility?

**P9:**  10:24  
Just more like awareness, like education as to what it entails and what it is. Okay.

**P9:**  10:35  
All right. So a little more content or information about

**P9:**  10:41  
what it is public knowledge, I guess, okay.

**P9:**  10:45  
If you were to go and try to find a CSV at this point, let's say, you know, basketball for 10 years, and now you're that first time homebuyer or you're interested in the VA, VA, how would you go about trying to find information about CME now?

**P9:**  11:01  
I was still going to eat benefits. Okay. However, because they disappeared from the benefits like that, it would just be better. Maybe easier, fine. Okay.

**P9:**  11:13  
Now, actually, it hasn't disappeared yet. So you're right about that part. It is going to get migrated at the point when he benefits is finally shut down. Because va.gov is the idea is it's going to be a little more modern. So that's why we're trying to find out if there's anything we can do to make it better as we go. But for right now, it's still there. So EAD benefits, and they'll be going away is what you're saying. Right? Yeah, it's gonna be sunset, I don't have a timeframe for it. But for the last couple of years, we have been working to pull features from there over to be a.gov. Okay, talking about va.gov. And so that kind of leads us into the next thing. We're talking about just VA websites in general. Have you used va.gov?

**P9:**  12:02  
I have. I'm one of the I use it when I was looking for education benefits. My kids.

**P9:**  12:08  
Okay, so I'm just thinking about your experiences with va.gov. And really, with anything else, any other VA website? What experiences good ones, and or bad ones have you had with our sites?

**P9:**  12:24  
So good experiences? Sure. The information? Is there. bad experiences? It's a lot. It's hard to navigate through like, right? Yes. It's a lot of so many options. That you might think you're stuck with a VA one you click is not there. So I think it's, it's too busy.

**P9:**  12:46  
Okay. No, that's really good feedback. And we do hear that. Yeah, I understand that. So yes, there is content, but too much. And a lot of different options is kind of what I'm hearing you Yes. on that. Now thinking about va.gov, and then thinking back to E benefits. How would you compare the two, since you have experience with both?

**P9:**  13:12  
I think, even if it's easier to navigate,

**P9:**  13:14  
okay. Now, that's really good feedback. That's the sort of thing that if we did something, right, we want to try to keep that. So it was easier to navigate in, in what way? Like, just the click through navigation or the organization,

**P9:**  13:29  
the organization but also with a benefit. So it's what's the word I'm looking for? is more personalized, versus va.gov is, in general information. So there's a lot of information during the veterans period across the board versus the benefits of moreso. Center to your benefit as a veteran, you don't even need that information. Right. The

**P9:**  13:59  
benefit is your information. I do understand that. And you're not the first person to tell us that just in terms of the organization. So you know, that's the sort of stuff that is we talked to more and more people we serve as we put it in our findings, and we'll we'll do something with it. So we'll try to improve the experience that way. So when it comes to using VA websites for VA, Home Loan benefits and those sorts of things. How do you how do you feel about how that information was packaged at you? You really, it sounds like you didn't run into that in the course of getting your home loan. But just thinking about websites in general, how do you feel about going to our websites for online information?

**P9:**  14:49  
Oh, I think it's beneficial, because the information is there. It's just a matter of knowing where to go and how to navigate through it.

**P9:**  15:00  
Okay. Yeah. And that that's really help. Sure. That's actually my next question. How can we help?

**P9:**  15:06  
I mean, it's like you can help us create. Okay, a more thorough help screen. Yeah. My frequently asked questions, I think should be expanded.

**P9:**  15:19  
Right. Okay. That? Yeah, that actually was my question. You know, what, what can we do to make that experience better and easier? So a screen that has FAQs and maybe more of that information? What sorts of questions would you want find answers for?

**P9:**  15:38  
More so how to navigate to like, in the military, for instance, well, we have a website or database, it will go through like the help screen will mirror that database. So if I get to a section where I'm like, Oh, I don't really understand what this is. On the help screen, it pulls up the same section, and it explains what that is, like, when you fill out forms. On the back, it says lock one, this is what goes there, like something like that.

**P9:**  16:04  
Okay, so something is more like a one to one correspondence to?

**P9:**  16:07  
Yeah.

**P9:**  16:08  
What you're looking at. Okay.

**P9:**  16:10  
Yeah,

**P9:**  16:11  
you mentioned that you'd want to know about the process. Which process like the loan or the home loan process in general, Civ specifically.

**P9:**  16:22  
So the home loan process in general, because what happens if you do get that realtor does not experience?

**P9:**  16:28  
Okay, now, that makes perfect sense. Okay, so going back to when you had started this, and I think I know the answer to you at least part of this. What was it that you wish you knew about that home buying process? And, and I know, you probably wanted to know where that CSV is, but is there anything else that you'd like to have had answered? before you started something that we could put in a site? or putting an FAQ?

**P9:**  16:57  
Or like, what? Cuz I'm not sure if you guys have it or not, but like, Is there like a checklist that says, As a veteran, these are all the things you need prior to, like, prereq lists? Right? Like telling me you need this, this and this single talk to you. And then you're going to need this, this and this, like just a heads up of? So you're not blindsided, right? You can prepare to get the things that you need, in advance, have you actually taken those steps to apply?

**P9:**  17:31  
Okay, that that's actually really good insight. And that sounds like that would be a really helpful tool. So it's only gonna make note of that, because I think that's within our scope to provide you. Okay. We're pretty much towards the end of my question. The kind of the last one that I have for just tools in the home loan process, in general, is, if somebody were to come to you and say, you know, thinking about a VA, home loan, what can you tell me? What advice can you give? What would you tell that person

**P9:**  18:05  
go to a benefit to share theory? And then I would tell them to look for a realtor that has experience.

**P9:**  18:13  
Okay, because that's going back to one of the first things he said that was probably the number one most important thing is to find somebody with experience with veterans.

**P9:**  18:24  
Yes. Because, especially if you're a first time homeowner, we don't know, like, I don't have a clue where to start. But with that person knowing, because there's like, little things that you know, you have to know, right? Because we have questions of the buyer. And having a realtor that can answer those questions is beneficial. Because I'm trusting them that they're doing everything they're supposed to be doing. It works out to my benefit. Definitely.

**P9:**  18:54  
Okay. And since they have that perspective on your, you know, your particular circumstances, you know, that the steps are big steps are the same, but the little steps are a little bit different sometimes. So knowing that, I can see that. Okay. Well, that's pretty much everything on my list. And we're pretty close to time. So I think we're right there. Is there anything else that you would like for us to know about va.gov benefits, VA benefits in general that we can put in our findings.

**P9:**  19:22  
Now, even if it's, like I said, that was good, but the va.gov just make it more broader subject, I guess. Okay. Instead of like 50 different leaks.

**P9:**  19:37  
Right. Yeah, I think I know what you're talking about there. So on a page where there's just a lot of things making you to different pages. Yes, try to keep all the information in one spot.

**P9:**  19:50  
Yeah. And then like some of the links, you click on, it takes you to the same screen. So I can click different links, and I noticed that I was looking for education. Right Great Lakes, but they still take me to the same spot.

**P9:**  20:07  
Yeah, I know what you're talking about. I know exactly what you're talking about. I had the same experience when I'm trying to do a breakdown on these things. So that also is really good insight into what we need to do to make the navigation better. Alright, well, I really appreciate you taking some time and giving us your thoughts and telling us about your experiences. So that's all we have. So thank you so much.

**P9:**  20:31  
Yes, sir. Thank you. I appreciate it. All right. We'll have today. Okay, you too. Bye bye.
