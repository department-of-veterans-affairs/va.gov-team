## Intro
Good morning/afternoon and thank you for joining us today. With me are a few colleagues who are helping-out by observing and taking notes. We are part of a team with the Department of Veterans Affairs that's moving some features of the old eBenefits site over to VA.gov. We're learning what Veterans need to improve their online experience, and how we can make VA.gov more useful for you. Our focus today is the VA Certificate of Eligibility -- or COE -- required for VA Home Loans and VA Native American Direct Loans.

There are a few things I need to mention before we start:
- The session should take about 30 minutes. But you can end it at any point -- just let me know. We have quite a few things to cover, so to respect your time, I may occasionally break-in to move us to the next item.
- We're not testing you in any way -- there are no right or wrong answers. We want to hear your thoughts about your experiences so that we can make improvements to VA.gov.
- Please say what's on your mind -- good and bad. I will not be offended by any opinions you express.
- We'd like to record this session. This'll give us a record to use for note-taking. We'll store the recording on a private drive, and it will be deleted when we conclude our testing and note-taking. No personal identifying information will be transcribed.
- I'll ask "on the record" once the recording starts.
- OK, now that I've hit the button, do I have your permission to record this session?

## Warm-up
- Would you tell us a little bit about yourself? Your service experience, general experiences with the VA...
- Have you applied for a VA-backed loan before?
- How have you learned about VA benefits in the past?
- Have you ever visited the eBenefits site? How about VA.gov?

## Section one: The loan process
- You mentioned you applied for a VA-backed loan before. do you remember how you heard about VA loan benefits?
- So when you applied for the loan, what were the steps in the process?
- What -- or who-- was the biggest help in getting you through the process?
- What went well in applying for the loan?
- What was the single biggest problem you ran into? How did you finally get past it?
- What other problems did you run into?
- Thinking about the home-buying process in general, what tools do you remember being especially helpful or easy-to-use?

## Section two: COE
- Can you tell us what a Certificate of Eligibility is? Can you tell us how you got a COE?
- What were the most challenging things about getting your COE? What was easy; what difficulties were there?
- What do you know about COE requirements?
- I have a detail question about the COE: your Funding Fee status is an item on the COE, was this important for you to know when you applied for COE and why?
- What documentation did you have to provide? What challenges did this cause?
- What other options do you know of for how to get a COE?
- Knowing what you do now about COE, would you do anything differently?

## Section three: tools and features
- Thinking about your experience with VA websites, what experiences -- good and bad -- have you had in trying to manage your benefits?
- How do you feel about using VA websites for some or all of the VA loan process? What would you need to do that?
- What could we do -- on VA.gov or in the real world -- to make the getting a VA-back loan easier?
- Looking back, what questions do you wish you had answered before you started?
- How could we make getting a COE simpler?
- What about the whole home-buying process? what do you wish it looked like?
- Thinking about the whole process, what advice would you give to someone applying for a VA-backed loan?

## Wrap-up
Looks like we covered everything on my list. (ALT) Looks like we're at (time), so we'll need to leave it here. Is there anything else you'd like us to know--something we didn't cover about COE, VA loans, or VA.gov in general?

## Closing
Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us! Your feedback is critical to our team's effort to improve Veterans' online experiences--and VA.gov in particular. Enjoy the rest of your day!
