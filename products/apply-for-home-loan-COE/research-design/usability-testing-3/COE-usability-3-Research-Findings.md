## Research Goals
Requesting a COE is available to Veterans throughout their journey (including while they are active service members) but it is called out as "Revisiting housing" in the "Putting down roots" leg of the Veteran journey.
[See the Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)  

**The purpose of this research was to:**
 
1. Learn if the new additional questions about name change, disability, home damage, etc. make sense to Veterans.
2. Validate that making the form as short as possible using conditional logic to expose only the screens and content the Veteran needs to see lowers cognitive load for Veterans.
3. Understand if offering additional context after the question is posed rather than before will increase usability by decreasing cognitive load. (Tucking additional contextual information into accordions instead of making them to read it all before posing the question.)

## Research Questions

*List the research questions that guided this study.*  

1. Do the new additional questions that have been added to the form make sense to the Veteran.
2. Can we make the form as short as possible using conditional logic to only show Veterans the screens and content that they need to see
3. Will tucking additional contextual information into accordions after the question improve the experience for Veterans so they can choose whether or not they read it instead of forcing them to read it before the question?

## Methodology 

We conducted 11 45 minute remote moderated research sessions via Zoom from June 30th to July 8th 2021. Participants were asked to complete a new prototype version of the Certificate of Eligibility form.


## Hypotheses and Conclusions

**Hypothesis Statement:** If we break the form down so that it follows the one question per page paradigm it will make the form easier to understand and quicker to complete

**Likely true**

**Hypothesis Statement:** If we leveraging conditional logic to only expose necessary questions, context, ease of use and understanding will increase.

**Definitely true**

- **Hypothesis Statement:** If we tuck additional contextual information in accordions below the questions instead of forcing users to read all available context before answering a question it will make the form easier to complete.

**Likely True**

[Example Hypotheses and Conclusions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/initiatives/2021-post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#hypotheses-and-conclusions)


## Key Findings


[Example Key Findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/initiatives/2021-post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#key-findings)

**1.** All participants (11 of 11) were able to complete the form without getting stuck

**2.** All participants (11 of 11) understood the "Has your name changed" question

**3.** Almost all (10 of 11) understood that the additional information was available in the "Understanding your COE options" accordion. The one who didn't see it (because they were on a phone suggested that having additional information in an accordion would have been helpful)

**4.** Almost all (10 of 11) understood the "Were you discharged because of a disability" question

**5** Most participants had nothing but compliments for how clean, clear, and easy the form was.


## **Additional Insights**
**5.** One participant wanted a link to additional information about the COE options (Entitlement, Cash out refinance, Interest rate reduction refinance loan)

**6.** One participant was unclear if a medboard was the same as "discharged because of a disability"

**7.** Two users mentioned confusion about what the "VA file number" was but ultimately decided it was unnecessary

## Recommendations 

1. **Potential Recommendation:** If it exists, add a link to a new page that provides details on the COE options  


2. **Recommendation:** Ship the form in it's current state (after it's cleared by content review)

## Product User and Business Outcomes


- **Desired User Outcome**
  - This research supports our desired user outcome of Veterans having a positive experience when completing the online form
 
- **Desired Business Outcome**
- Adding fields with additional information supports the desired outcome of Online form submissions that can successfuly processed by downstream systems and reducing additional information cycles between VA Staff and the Veteran

  - This research supports our desired business outcome by better matching the paper form and providing more information to the form processors ultimately reducing the need for reaching out to the Veterans for additional information necessary to complete the form and issue a Certificate of Eligibility


## Key Performance Indicators

 

- **KPI 1**
  -  This research supports measurement of improving the "Average time to approval" by collecting information that might require requesting additional information from the Veteran


## Next Steps

Implement additional context links where possible and head to midpoint review.  


## Further research needed

A topic that might be worth researching is whether or not "VA File number" is still a useful data point to ask for or if it just slows down the completion time.
