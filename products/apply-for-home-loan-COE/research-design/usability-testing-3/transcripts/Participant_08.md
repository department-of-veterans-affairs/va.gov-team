#### Participant 08: Yeah.

143
00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:01.199
#### Moderator: Understood and and is all the is. Is

144
00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:06.460
#### Moderator: the information in in the blue box here? What what you would expect to see or or is.

145
00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:21.259
#### Participant 08: Absolutely 100%. It's telling me the date is telling me the time. It's giving me a reference number. Sorry now, sometimes I do take a screenshot if I if if

146
00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:41.049
#### Participant 08: if I needed the reference number, I would take a screenshot that way, I don't have to print it out. But I would keep scrolling down. What are my next steps? Because that would tell me how long it's gonna be? How can I check my status? So just because I saw the word, how can I check the status of my request? I would have taken a screenshot

147
00:12:41.312 --> 00:12:45.519
#### Participant 08: that way. I keep that reference number. So if I have to go back and check.

148
00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:46.180
#### Moderator: Okay.

149
00:12:46.532 --> 00:13:03.099
#### Participant 08: And you know again, I'm sure if I were to check the status of my of your request, I it would ask for the reference number. That's my guess. So I would keep the reference number. Now, I never do feedback. So I typically ignore that.

150
00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:11.150
#### Moderator: Okay, good deal. Good deal, all right. Well, gosh! That was that was fantastic. That was.

151
00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:12.230
#### Participant 08: Oh, that's it!

152
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:14.169
#### Moderator: That's you, did it, that's it.

153
00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:15.489
#### Participant 08: Oh, okay.

154
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:31.689
#### Moderator: If, as you're looking back on on going through through it, was there anything that was that sort of that might have given you pause, or you had a question about, or that you didn't like that you would change. That comes to mind.

155
00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:48.840
#### Participant 08: Actually, it was very straightforward. And this is what I like about Va Gov over over E benefits. The fact that you guys put like the green. So you know, green means go. Obviously the blue. You're drawn to the blue. I wouldn't change a thing.

156
00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:52.860
#### Participant 08: As a matter of fact, I'm gonna go apply for mine today.

157
00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:54.499
#### Moderator: Do it. I love it.

158
00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:55.600
#### Participant 08: Yeah.

159
00:13:56.950 --> 00:14:11.120
#### Participant 08: great. It's actually very easy. I think even someone that's not computer literate could get it. And also what you a nice touch you had was finish finish up later. I noticed that was on several pages. So for people like

160
00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:29.100
#### Participant 08: not like myself, that need to go and find their Dd. 214, or their separation papers. They could hit finish up, finish this later and come back so there would be no fear. And you don't get that that angst. So yeah, no, I thought it was great.

161
00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:32.070
#### Moderator: Awesome. Well, thank you so much for your time today.

162
00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:33.820
#### Participant 08: Thank you. Thank you.

163
00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:39.810
#### Moderator: Let's see here I've got. I've got some more boilerplate to read here real quick, so just bear with me.

164
00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:47.569
#### Moderator: Parisian will be sending you a thank you. Note with a little blurb, that you can pass along to other veterans. You may know.
