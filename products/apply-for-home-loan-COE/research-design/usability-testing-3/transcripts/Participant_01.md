#### **Participant 01**: I I have it saved in my files on my phone, so I haven't applied for a Va home loan myself, my ex-wife, when she kind of messed up my credit, so I'm still in process of rebuilding, which is, it's good right now, but it's not as good as I want it to be. When I do apply for the loan.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:24.450
#### **Moderator** : Gotcha.

31
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:40.230
#### **Participant 01**: But I do. I remember having to dig around some files years ago, when I 1st got out in 2020 and I think it said letters. Then it said, your eligibility. Then it pops up this little letter, saying that I'm eligible for the Va. Home loan.

32
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:47.670
#### **Participant 01**: So I have it saved cause. I don't even remember how I got there. So I was like, Okay, I'm gonna just save this. I might need this later.

33
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.579
#### **Moderator** : Gotcha. Okay, cool. So you have automatic eligibility.

34
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.770
#### **Participant 01**: Right? Yes.

35
00:02:52.770 --> 00:03:00.030

37
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.689
#### **Moderator** : the way we're asking questions, the order of things, that it all that it all makes sense.

91
00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:05.949

#### **Participant 01**: what about if there's people it doesn't pertain to me. But I do know a lot of people who were.

102
00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:08.870
#### **Participant 01**: I guess.

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:51.269
#### **Moderator** : And then, yeah, and then come back here.

117
00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:54.739

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:12.240
#### **Participant 01**: It's higher separated service because of a disability. Would that alright? So when it comes to this, would that basically mean like a Med board.

121
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:15.300
Mike King: I believe so. Yes.

122
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:27.610

#### **Moderator** : Okay.

127
00:09:48.640 --> 00:10:04.299
#### **Participant 01**: Get into. Oh, okay, that situation applies to me because they may not, you know, know, some people get out and deal with a lot of mental stress, and they just don't even think about their service. Try not to. So they know what applies to.

128
00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:09.149
#### **Participant 01**: Sure. Sure. What should I click? Yes, no. Or is it gonna do the same thing on the next.

133
00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:25.280

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:46.730
#### **Participant 01**: Yeah. Cancel, adding, this period, what happens if a person served more than once, how would that work like? Say, they did 2 different things, you know. Say they were in the army for this long, but then they went to another branch for a year, a year after, right after.

137
00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:48.880
#### **Moderator** : How would you expect that to work.

138
00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:52.489
#### **Participant 01**: Yeah, exactly. I don't know if I just would put

139
00:10:52.630 --> 00:11:15.260
#### **Participant 01**: when I 1st joined the military to completely out. But I know there are cases like I had a staff sergeant. He actually he's I think he's retired now. But he ended up leaving the marines, and then was gone for about a year or 2, and then re-enlisted in the marines. But there was a long time ago. But at the same time, if he were to use this tool. How would he explain it? You know.

140
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:16.330
#### **Moderator** : Gotcha.

141
00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:23.520
#### **Participant 01**: Like something that says, if more than one period, or if you were, you re-enlisted, but went reservist.

142
00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.460
#### **Participant 01**: you know, add more figures of service.

143
00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:34.188
#### **Moderator** : Yeah. Yup, Yup, you'll you'll yeah. You'll oh, shoot. No, no, no, I it was supposed to. It was supposed to.

144
00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:38.190
#### **Moderator** : sorry the the prototype was supposed to show you.

145
00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:46.540
#### **Moderator** : The the screen was supposed to show you the ability to add another period of service.

146
00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:47.699
#### **Participant 01**: Oh, okay. Which is.

147
00:11:47.700 --> 00:12:01.109
#### **Moderator** : But which is exactly what you were asking about. But to to answer your question it it absolutely should I? That's you know what I'm gonna make a note. Darn it, it's it's not supposed to. It's supposed to give you the oper opportunity to add another period.

148
00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:03.590
Mike King: Okay, yeah, you're fine. Ian, I got the note.

149
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:04.770
#### **Moderator** : Great thanks. Mike.

150
00:12:07.649 --> 00:12:31.390
#### **Participant 01**: Entitlement, inquiry. Purchase a loan, cash out, refinance, interested rate, reduction or refinance understanding cop options. What happens if I click this right here. Okay, this is nice. Oh, it explains because obviously that explains itself explanatory when it says, you know, entitlement of inquiry. But the fact that there's definitions. That's nice.

151
00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:39.260
#### **Participant 01**: let's see, what would, I think, purchase a home.

152
00:12:46.560 --> 00:13:00.070
#### **Participant 01**: I know when someone's using this. They should have done like a little more research, but this may be their 1st step into finding out if they can even use a Va home loan. So before they go looking into homes. But if I were to. I think you know.

153
00:13:00.843 --> 00:13:07.310
#### **Participant 01**: Possibly turning this into links. I I don't know if it's a good idea or a bad idea. I'm just.

154
00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:13.080
#### **Moderator** : Oh, you mean to to give them a a place to go to, to understand deeper.

155
00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:35.690
#### **Participant 01**: Right as opposed to just this, and them having to go to searching. Possibly like. Okay, here's what it means in a nutshell which is good, like these paragraphs, but also clicking on it to where it pulls up another web page and then telling me the more information on the steps, and like basically everything that you wouldn't put and just bombard with information in these paragraphs.

156
00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:39.941
#### **Participant 01**: Right. I was thinking that'd be nice.

157
00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.330
#### **Participant 01**: Am I good to continue, or should I click something.

158
00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:45.330
#### **Moderator** : Yeah, yeah, yeah. Pick pick whatever you want.

159
00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:49.709
#### **Participant 01**: Okay, let's see entirely, because that's what usually people

160
00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.170
#### **Participant 01**: come for it. Make sure they're still good for it.

161
00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:58.320
#### **Participant 01**: Have you ever had a Va. Background. No, I'm not.

162
00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:01.460
#### **Participant 01**: This is nice. Let's see.

163
00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:16.418
#### **Participant 01**: Alright, what is this? Upload documents? Discharge paper? Just Dd, 2, 14. And I was okay. This is pretty cool. Is it possible to possibly, since I'd be signed into the Va

164
00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:35.600
#### **Participant 01**: website while using this would it be able to pull my information already. I know it's kind of tricky with the d. 2 14 s. You have to sometimes request to get them sent to you in case you lose them or they burn in a house fire. But would it possibly be able to automatically input my information? So even when

165
00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:36.710
#### **Participant 01**: I was here.

166
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:38.469
#### **Moderator** : Work. We are working on that.

167
00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:41.439
#### **Participant 01**: Okay, I'm just saying that'd be a good idea, because then.

168
00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.140
#### **Moderator** : Yeah.

169
00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:51.919
#### **Participant 01**: I gotta sit there and go find it. Take a picture and make sure it works so far as maybe the picture I upload may not be the a good picture, for

170
00:14:52.050 --> 00:15:04.360
#### **Participant 01**: on the other end, you know. So the fact that it could like just download all your information already. It be pretty neat, cause, you know. Obviously I'm signed in, and it has everything there already.

171
00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:14.390
#### **Moderator** : Right? Yeah, typically, you know, it's funny you asked, that. I think I think in situations where they do have the ability to grab your service data.

172
00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:14.960
#### **Participant 01**: Right.

173
00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:21.499
#### **Moderator** : You get to skip this whole thing and you just get the automatic eligibility. So this.

174
00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:22.220
#### **Participant 01**: Correct.

175
00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:31.289
#### **Moderator** : This is kind of an edge case like maybe that. Either either the the database that has that information is down, or you know, there's there's some sort of issue.

176
00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:42.422
#### **Participant 01**: Or someone hasn't set up the my health event? Everything all that stuff cause. Aren't you able to so get a Coe? Yeah, because I think before I started getting my

177
00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:55.979
#### **Participant 01**: There's a way for me to get this certificate eligibility I have prior to me being like service connected, and actually set up the whole profile with the my healthy vet and all this different stuff. Yeah, so this makes sense. I see what you mean.

178
00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:59.840
#### **Moderator** : Yeah, you can. You can actually get a Coe as an active duty service member

179
00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:06.509
#### **Moderator** : as long as you've as long, I think, is, it's the the requirement is 90 days of active duty.

180
00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:07.430
#### **Participant 01**: Right.

181
00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:08.140
#### **Moderator** : No.

182
00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:11.590
#### **Participant 01**: This. Just watch paper.

183
00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:17.399
#### **Participant 01**: And I'm assuming this was just me choosing from my files on my computer change.

184
00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:27.349
#### **Moderator** : Yeah. Yeah. And then you'd select, you know. Dd, 2, 14. We sort of skip that because we cause we can't really mock up the the dropdown select in the in the prototype. So we kinda

185
00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:29.709
#### **Moderator** : fudge that a little bit.

186
00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.570
#### **Participant 01**: Let's see the review process. Huh!

187
00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:34.480
#### **Participant 01**: And click this.

188
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:39.339
#### **Moderator** : And we don't have the the expand linked up on this just yet.

189
00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:47.470
#### **Participant 01**: I would.

190
00:16:48.083 --> 00:16:55.409
#### **Participant 01**: No, it's fine. I was. Gonna say, maybe how it says, enter your name. And then, since this is something so important

191
00:16:55.570 --> 00:17:01.569
#### **Participant 01**: and making sure nobody's just going off of pure luck or something stolen, maybe have

192
00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:18.530
#### **Participant 01**: put your name in the last 4 of your social that way, you know, for sure it's that person. The full name is fine, that like I don't mind, but it could always be somebody that knows too much in your life, and has access to certain things so, but they may not know the last 4 of your social.

193
00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:19.810
#### **Moderator** : Understood.

194
00:17:20.193 --> 00:17:22.809
#### **Participant 01**: 2 14, I mean probably would, but.

195
00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:23.599
#### **Moderator** : Right.

196
00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:24.939
#### **Participant 01**: But you know what I mean right?

197
00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:26.299
#### **Moderator** : Yeah, absolutely.

198
00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:29.869
#### **Participant 01**: So let's say my certify.

199
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:32.020
#### **Moderator** : You don't have to worry about the checkbox.

200
00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:33.219
#### **Participant 01**: Okay. Reflex.

201
00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.399
#### **Moderator** : Yeah, no. Right? Yeah.

202
00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:40.800
#### **Participant 01**: Alright. Let's see. Request via date submitted reference number

203
00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:46.289
#### **Participant 01**: alright. Is there a way for? Let's see, what are my next steps? We'll review the request.

204
00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:50.419
#### **Participant 01**: We'll contact you. Okay, you can check your status.

205
00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:54.341
#### **Participant 01**: Oh, I was just about to ask that. But let me check your status.

206
00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:59.599
#### **Participant 01**: Alright. Let's see, am I able to see how the status would look if I checked it?

207
00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:02.599
#### **Moderator** : Oh, no, we don't have that mocked up.

208
00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:03.650
#### **Participant 01**: Gotcha gotcha, but.

209
00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:07.280
#### **Moderator** : It'll it'll it'll it'll give you, you know details.

210
00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:15.700
#### **Participant 01**: That's nice. I like you're able to still check the status. I like the fact that it was easy for me to use, because I know sometimes when I'm

211
00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:25.189
#### **Participant 01**: doing some like stuff on the Va website, like, for instance, like the whole pulling up health records thing that's pain in the ass. But, excuse my language. Sorry.

212
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:28.640
#### **Moderator** : No, don't worry about it. You're fine.

213
00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:40.499
#### **Participant 01**: The whole point of me bringing that up was just to say that there are certain parts of the website on the Va. Website that are very confusing and bombarding, and with this one the fact that I feel like I was able to go through it.

214
00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:42.140
#### **Participant 01**: and even

215
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:50.380
#### **Participant 01**: you, it'd be smart to make sure you have all your information filled out correctly, but it'd be kind of hard for an individual to not

216
00:18:50.914 --> 00:19:01.889
#### **Participant 01**: to make a mistake on filling this out. Since you're not saying, fill out all this stuff on this one page is more of fill out this cool. You got that. Fill out this. All right, let's go this way.

217
00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:06.280
#### **Participant 01**: So that's pretty nice. I like that. It wasn't a bombarding, you know.

218
00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:11.800
#### **Participant 01**: Application. It was you split it up, and which I feel is like fair, you know.

219
00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:14.172
#### **Participant 01**: margins, basically. But

220
00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:19.819
#### **Moderator** : Do you have a do you have an example in mind of of

221
00:19:20.489 --> 00:19:26.639
#### **Moderator** : pages or applications on the Va. That are are like you described bombarding.

222
00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:39.112
#### **Participant 01**: It was on my Vrne that was, I mean, the claims can be. But I tried that one time. Never did it again. I just went to a Vsl rep cause that that's a lot. But

223
00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:40.220
#### **Moderator** : Gotcha.

224
00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:57.422
#### **Participant 01**: What's it called? I wanna say, maybe my VR, and the application that was that was a lot. If that was like this, it would be way more helpful because it was just like really repetitive, and making sure you had to fill out this. Fill out this. Don't lose the page because you have to start from the beginning, you know.

225
00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:58.120
#### **Participant 01**: got it.

226
00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:07.642
#### **Participant 01**: Me getting so far as applications. That's the only thing I can think I filled out. It would be nice to be able to fill out, cause I have

227
00:20:09.227 --> 00:20:11.940
#### **Participant 01**: clothing allowance. There, that's what it's called.

228
00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:25.930
#### **Participant 01**: And in order to get that. Obviously, you have to go to the actual Va hospitals. But it'd be also nice to fill it out here online as well. That'd be good, because essentially they're still pulling your same medical records. So

229
00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:29.369
#### **Participant 01**: it the fact that I have to still go to the

230
00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:38.579
#### **Participant 01**: prosthetics was kind of confusing because I thought it'd be something you could fill out online. Since all you're gonna pull up is my service connected disabilities, you know.

231
00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:39.480
#### **Moderator** : Right.

232
00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:42.430
#### **Participant 01**: Right, but I'm sorry I'm I'm getting sidetracked on some.

233
00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:57.779
#### **Moderator** : No, no, no, I I asked. I asked. And and you, answered I, this is all really good stuff. I I mean having you having you explain things that are, you know, not the way you want to be helps us know? Like, okay.

234
00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:04.980
#### **Moderator** : what he said, don't do that, you know. And and yeah, so I know it's all. It's all good stuff, all good stuff.

235
00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:14.100
#### **Participant 01**: Especially since I. I live in such a rural area, and and I live in the central valley of California. I live in a city called Madera, but more towards the country.

236
00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:26.490
#### **Participant 01**: The nearest one I closest to me is maybe 45 min to an hour, depending on traffic and Fresno, which would be, you know, quite a drive itself to go do something so simple.

237
00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:32.013
#### **Participant 01**: you know. I could imagine like when I had leg surgery cause

238
00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:35.634
#### **Participant 01**: my deformed leg I was telling you about, cause

239
00:21:36.472 --> 00:21:42.060
#### **Participant 01**: it was a pain in the butt for me to have to go on those car rides to get checked up every week. So.

240
00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:42.710
#### **Moderator** : Yeah.

241
00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:46.240
#### **Participant 01**: When you're filling out applications. Even

242
00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:51.159
#### **Participant 01**: you kind of don't wanna have. It's gonna sound, not out of pure laziness. But

243
00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:54.669
#### **Participant 01**: there's other veterans in worse situations where they can't.

244
00:21:54.830 --> 00:22:01.939
#### **Participant 01**: Some can't even drive themselves in front of right. So it should be fairly accessible access really accessible for them to

245
00:22:02.647 --> 00:22:13.709
#### **Participant 01**: fill out applications on the website. I feel like the only thing that they, you know, they figured out a way to get you a video visit, for you know, meet you being sick, which I.

246
00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:14.050
#### **Moderator** : Right.

247
00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:21.390
#### **Participant 01**: Realize to this day they should figure out a way to, you know. Okay, you gotta do a housing housing allowance. Okay, certificate eligibility.

248
00:22:22.135 --> 00:22:27.354
#### **Participant 01**: And then I think also will be good for this right here.

249
00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:46.759
#### **Participant 01**: How? It says you could check the request, and then maybe a couple of links all the way at the bottom. Kind of like. How if I was filling out an essay? And you know, Apa style with the references at the bottom, just to give people more information like, Okay, what would be your next steps after this? Well, I see that part. Not that I mean, like

250
00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:58.539
#### **Participant 01**: links at the bottom of the page. That would say more information on, you know the Va Home Loan how to use it, what to do? Just basically like a whole Walkthrough page, just of.

251
00:22:58.540 --> 00:22:59.310
#### **Moderator** : Gotcha.

252
00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:03.510
#### **Participant 01**: Right. Not exactly what are my next steps, because that's clearly there, but.

253
00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:03.930
#### **Moderator** : Right.

254
00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:09.070
#### **Participant 01**: I mean, so far as you know, just little references like helpful links. There you go, things like that.

255
00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:16.013
#### **Moderator** : Love it, love it, love it very cool, very cool, all right.

256
00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:27.750
#### **Moderator** : let's see here you mentioned helpful links at the end. If if there's if there, if there was, if you had a magic wand, and there was one thing you could change

257
00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:43.107
#### **Moderator** : about, and and so we're not worried about reality. We're not worried about constraints, just like if there was one thing you could change about filling out for. And you've mentioned quite a few already. But I always ask this question.

258
00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:47.010
#### **Moderator** : If there was anything you could change, what like? What would you change.

259
00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:49.060
#### **Participant 01**: Maybe.

260
00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:57.540
#### **Participant 01**: not the animation I'm looking for, not the font

261
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.870
#### **Participant 01**: of the whole process, just of everything on it.

262
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:05.699
#### **Moderator** : What a dude dude we! Here is your magic wand.

263
00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:13.109
#### **Moderator** : Like, and you can change anything. A a small piece, a huge piece, all of it. None of it.

264
00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:14.859
#### **Participant 01**: Other than.

265
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:15.600
#### **Moderator** : Yeah.

266
00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.770
#### **Participant 01**: Other than auto filling information. I.

267
00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:39.542
#### **Participant 01**: Maybe make it more animated in a way to keep the person engaged, because there are people like, say, for instance, with the bar where it's just blue. Something simple, is it? Flashing, saying like, Oh, I'm on this step. Oh, I'm on this step. Oh, shit! I'm almost done, you know maybe more intriguing, not obviously making it like a cartoon. But

268
00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:55.839
#### **Participant 01**: you know, just more appealing and grasping to the user. I know whoever's using this is obviously trying to get some information so they should be grasped. But, like I said, there are a lot of people who can get very distracted and sidetracked, so they may

269
00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:59.364
#### **Participant 01**: need something like that, maybe.

270
00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:01.280
#### **Participant 01**: What is it?

271
00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:10.109
#### **Participant 01**: A little speaker button in the corner, whereas there's all this blank stuff like the whole white side of the page.

272
00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:12.295
#### **Participant 01**: There may be people who have

273
00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:20.559
#### **Participant 01**: hard of reading something so small in that font like. So maybe click the speaker, and we'll read everything to you.

274
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:21.400
#### **Moderator** : Okay.

275
00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:22.110
#### **Participant 01**: Home.

276
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:25.380
#### **Moderator** : Some some robust accessibility controls.

277
00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:32.929
#### **Participant 01**: Right, maybe a little chat box in the corner right side. Not like a live person or anything like that, but maybe

278
00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:41.870
#### **Participant 01**: a little. AI say I'm confused about a situation. So oh, for instance, the discharge thing. And oh! Does this apply to me? And.

279
00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:42.610
#### **Moderator** : Right.

280
00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:47.390
#### **Participant 01**: Answer. Your best option would be to click this one and something like that.

281
00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:49.959
#### **Participant 01**: Nice. I like that.

282
00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:53.519
#### **Moderator** : I like that a lot. That's a cool suggestion.

283
00:25:55.630 --> 00:26:00.030
#### **Moderator** : all right. Well, cool man, Anthony, thank you so much for your time.

284
00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:00.350
#### **Participant 01**: No.

285
00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:09.065
#### **Moderator** : and yeah, we're definitely gonna gonna take what you've told us and and make this better.

286
00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:13.810
#### **Moderator** : And here let me just read the the formal part of this. Okay.

#### **Moderator** : and lastly, Perugian will be sending you a thank you. Note with a little blurb, that you can pass along to other veterans, you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

291
00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:42.059

292
00:26:42.875 --> 00:26:44.999
#### **Participant 01**: Anything else you guys need from me or.

293
00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:47.759
#### **Moderator** : No, no, I think we're. I think we're good.

294
00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.350
#### **Participant 01**: Alright, thank you so much. You guys have a great day.
