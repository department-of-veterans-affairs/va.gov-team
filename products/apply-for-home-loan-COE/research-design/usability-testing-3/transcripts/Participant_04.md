00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:03.500
#### Moderator: Yeah.

140
00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.080
#### Participant 04: Trying to think. What was it?

141
00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.080
#### Participant 04: Personally.

142
00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.000
#### Moderator: Information.

143
00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:18.190
#### Participant 04: Personal information. Some of the steps could be all on one page like my name. My birthday birthday could be on the same page as the first, st

144
00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:31.309
#### Participant 04: and all that, and this the mail address, I mean all of them 3 steps right there they could all be in one, you know. It seemed like I had to go one by 1, 1 by one, whatever, but they could actually be all on one page and everything, you know, just.

145
00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:31.640
#### Moderator: Okay.

146
00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.600
#### Participant 04: For for the personal information.

147
00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:35.260
#### Moderator: Great.

148
00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:37.549
#### Moderator: Right? Okay, cool.

149
00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:47.900
#### Moderator: Well, I I think, unless Mike or Tab, do you have any? Do you have any questions? I, unless they have questions. I think we're

150
00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:49.940
#### Moderator: I think that's a wrap.

151
00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:55.970
Mike King: No, I'm good. This was very helpful. Thanks so much, #### Participant 04. I appreciate all your time and your help on this.

152
00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:10.009
#### Participant 04: Yeah, no problem. And everything like, I say, I like, I'm just very adamant with the 1st page and everything like, just put everything on one, or whatever cause I feel like I think it's 1 out of 5. No, no, my bad one out, not one out 5. But you know your name, your address.

153
00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:10.400
#### Moderator: Right.

154
00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:26.349
#### Participant 04: And your personal information could be all on one page. Whatever the military history, I think I was like the easy one. I think that's 2 pages, the long history. I think that's 1 page and the upload document. I believe that's 1 page and all that. So just the personal page just make it all on one. It just it's make everything simplified.

155
00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.869
Mike King: Yeah, that makes sense.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.786
